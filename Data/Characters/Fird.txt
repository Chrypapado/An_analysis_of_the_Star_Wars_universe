He acted as the [[Senator/Legends|delegate]] from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] of [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]] in the legislature, and testified on the [[Matter of Creating an Outer Expansion Zone]] around the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[700 BBY]]. The hearings on the proposal ultimately concluded with the approval and creation of an [[Outer Expansion Zone/Legends|Outer Expansion Zone]] for Republic colonization in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] northern quadrant under the administration of the [[Expansionist Oligarchy/Legends|Expansionist Oligarchy]]. The endeavor later ended in a [[Outer Expansion Zone scandal|political crisis]] that forced the Senate to intervene in the region and reign in the Oligarchy.\n\n==Biography==\nFird was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]]<ref name=\"TEA 6\" /> from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]]<ref name=\"TEA 12\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]'', p. 12</ref> of [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]]<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> who lived during the [[Great Peace of the Republic]].<ref name=\"TCSWE era\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' identifies the [[Great Peace of the Republic]] as the era between the [[Seventh Battle of Ruusan|Battle of Rusaan]] {{C|[[1000 BBY]]}} and the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] {{C|[[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]}}; {{CSWECite|I|363|Great Peace of the Republic}}</ref> Around the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[700 BBY]], Fird served Alsakan as its [[Senator/Legends|legislative delegate]] in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], a proposal for the creation of an [[Outer Expansion Zone/Legends|Outer Expansion Zone]] of Republic colonization was introduced to the Senate for review and a vote. The effort was supported by several of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] megacorporations, which were displeased with the Republic's slow pace of expansion into the [[Inner Rim]] territories north of the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and the [[Perlemian Trade Route/Legends|Perlemian Trade Route]].<ref name=\"TEA 6\" />\n\nDuring the hearings on the [[Matter of Creating an Outer Expansion Zone]], Senator Fird addressed the Republic Congress, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of continuing to allow only the central government to commission colonies.<ref name=\"TEA 6\" /> The initiative to create the Zone was eventually approved, and the Senate delegated the task of administering the new colonies to the [[Expansionist Oligarchy/Legends|Expansionist Oligarchy]]&mdash;a consortium of megacorporations who had been advocating for the creation of the region. The experiment ultimately failed, however, as the Oligarchy began to exploit the resources and native peoples in the Outer Expansion Zone. The [[Outer Expansion Zone scandal|resulting scandals and uprisings]] forced the Senate to step in and relieve the Expansionist Oligarchy of control.<ref name=\"TEA 22\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]'', p. 22</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSenator Fird was a Human with dark [[Color/Legends|brown]] hair, green [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], black decorative markings on his face, and facial hair around his jawbone, mouth, and chin.<ref name=\"TEA 6\" /> He was an eloquent speaker,<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> and during his testimony on the Matter of Creating an Outer Expansion Zone, Fird asserted that there were two paths that could be pursued as a result of the debate&mdash;government-controlled expansion or an effort with more emphasis on local and corporate initiatives. The Alsakan senator disliked both possibilities, but conceded that there may have been no third alternative choice.<ref name=\"TEA 6\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSenator Fird was first mentioned in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', a compendium of information on subjects from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe, released in [[2008]].
