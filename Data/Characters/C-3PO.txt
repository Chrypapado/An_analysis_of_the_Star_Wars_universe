It's our lot in life.|C-3PO|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n'''C-3PO''', sometimes spelled '''See-Threepio''', often referred to  as '''Threepio''' and by some as '''3-So''', was a [[3PO-series protocol droid]] designed to interact with [[Sentience|organics]], programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. He was fluent in over six million forms of [[Language|communication]], and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many [[Time|decades]] of operation. Along with his counterpart, the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of [[The galaxy|galactic]] [[Timeline of galactic history|history]], and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.\n\nC-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by [[Anakin Skywalker]], a [[human]] [[Slavery|slave]] who lived in [[Mos Espa]], a [[city]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] world of [[Tatooine]]. Shortly after the [[Clone Wars]], C-3PO's memory was [[Memory wipe|erased]], though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the [[Alderaan]] [[CR90 corvette|cruiser]] ''[[Tantive IV]]'', where they served senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] for nineteen years. At some point during this time, 3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.\n\nThey became embroiled in the [[Galactic Civil War]] when [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] entrusted them to bring a copy of the [[Death Star plans]] to the [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] on Tatooine. After meeting Skywalker's son, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]], the droids helped rescue [[Prince]]ss Leia from the Empire's [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. They became directly attached to the three humans, helping them and their rebellion defeat the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy, most notably when he convinced the [[Ewok]]s to aid the Rebels at the [[Battle of Endor]].\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, C-3PO continued serving the Skywalkers and Han Solo during the time of the [[New Republic]]. About thirty years after the events on [[Endor]], C-3PO was still an aide to Leia Organa, who had become a [[General]] in the [[Resistance]], a private military group opposed to the [[First Order]], a military junta that emulated the Old Empire. By that time, C-3PO's language database had been updated so that he could understand and communicate in over seven million different forms of communication, including ancient Sith dialects.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early incarnation===\n{{Quote|Oh, might I remind you, sir, I was once protocol droid to the chief negotiator for the entire Manakron system.|C-3PO|Evil Plans}}\nIn an early incarnation, C-3PO served as a [[protocol droid]] to the chief negotiator for the [[Manakron system]].<ref name=\"Evil Plans\">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref> Additionally, he later claimed that his first job was programming [[binary loadlifter]]s, which he said were very similar to [[moisture vaporator]]s in most respects.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" />\n\n===Serving the Maker===\n{{Quote|He's perfect.|Padm\u00e9 Amidala after meeting C-3PO|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\n[[File:Anakin_Skywalker_gets_Threepio_photoreceptors.png|thumb|right|150px|Anakin Skywalker got C-3PO's photoreceptors in a chase through Mos Espa.]]\nAt some point, however, C-3PO fell into disrepair, and his vital components ended up in a junk pile on [[Tatooine]]. [[Anakin Skywalker]], a [[Slavery|slave]] boy from the Tatooinian [[city]] of [[Mos Espa]], collected scrap parts<ref name=\"Bio Gallery\">{{Databank|c-3po-biography-gallery|C-3PO Biography Gallery|archivedate=20191011023905}} {{C|Slide 1}}</ref> and started rebuilding C-3PO in [[34 BBY]]<ref name=\"2nd Reading\">''[[Star Wars Workbook: 2nd Grade Reading]]''</ref> so the droid would help his [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|mother]].<ref name=\"Bio Gallery\" /> As Anakin longed for a life far from Tatooine and explore [[the galaxy]], he hoped to have C-3PO as his and his mother's faithful companion so they would be able to venture the galaxy one day and understand and understood the languages of the natives they could come across with, given C-3PO's capability of millions of communication forms.<ref name=\"Skywalker: AFAW\">''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''</ref> Although protocol droids were normally designed for light duty in luxurious environments, Skywalker specially modified C-3PO so he could withstand Tatooine's sand and heat.<ref name=\"beware\">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> C-3PO served Anakin and his mother Shmi by performing household chores. During his time with Skywalker and Shmi, C-3PO's wiring was left exposed since Skywalker was unable to outfit him with an outer covering.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\nFollowing the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] planet of [[Naboo]], C-3PO's life entered a new chapter when his owner Anakin met several off-worlders at the shop of his owner, the [[Junk dealer]] [[Watto]], and then invited them to seek shelter at [[Skywalker home|his home]] during a sandstorm. The [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], the [[Queen]] of Naboo [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], the [[Gungan]] [[Jar Jar Binks]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]] were brought to the slave quarters that Anakin shared with his mother Shmi. As a result of this invitation, Amidala and R2-D2 were introduced to C-3PO. Upon meeting R2-D2, C-3PO was shocked when the candid astromech droid commented that he was \"naked.\" Despite the exchange, the two droids fast developed a friendship of sorts, working together to help Skywalker make final adjustments to [[Anakin Skywalker's Podracer|his podracer]] in time to race it in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing|race]]. While working on the [[podracer]], the two droids discussed space travel and noted the clumsy actions of Binks.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\n[[File:C-3PO_TPM.png|thumb|left|250px|In Mos Espa, C-3PO helped his owner prepare for the Boonta Eve pod race.]]\nOn the day of the race, C-3PO represented his owner in the opening flag parade, carrying Skywalker's flag onto [[Mos Espa Grand Arena|the course]] prior to the start of the race. He then stood on the sidelines with R2-D2 and two of Skywalker's playmates, [[Kitster Banai]] and [[Wald]], who cheered their friend on. Skywalker won the race, which, thanks to a deal that Jinn had struck with Watto, earned the boy his freedom from slavery and secured Jinn the [[T-14 hyperdrive generator|hyperdrive generator]] he needed to leave the planet. As Skywalker prepared to depart Tatooine, he said his goodbyes to C-3PO, apologizing for not having completed the droid's construction, and expressing his wishes that Shmi wouldn't sell him.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" />\n\n===Beyond Tatooine===\n{{Quote|There's been some terrible mistake. I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!|C-3PO during the Battle of Geonosis|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\nLater, his owner Shmi was sold to the [[moisture farmer]] [[Cliegg Lars]], who freed and married her. Shmi brought C-3PO along with her, and the protocol droid found himself in the service of the Lars family, who owned a [[Lars Homestead|moisture farm]] in the [[Jundland Wastes]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\" /> Shmi covered him<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> in a tarnished grey plating to shield him from Tatooine's sandy environment. Ten years after his parting with Anakin Skywalker, Shmi was kidnapped by a group of [[Tusken Raider]]s, fearsome nomads native to Tatooine's desert wastes. Sensing his mother's pain and anguish through [[the Force]], Anakin returned with his secret lover and childhood friend Padm\u00e9 Amidala to find his mother. Skywalker had advanced in his Jedi training as a [[Padawan]] under the tutelage of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], while Amidala had become a [[Senator]] in the [[Galactic Senate]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nWhen Skywalker and Amidala visited the Lars' moisture farm, they found C-3PO working on a moisture vaporator. He initially didn't recognize Skywalker until the latter finished his name for him when introducing himself. Greeting his Maker, C-3PO discovered that Skywalker had come in search of his mother, and brought the two guests into the homestead's courtyard, where they were met by Cliegg Lars, as well as his son, [[Owen Lars]] and his girlfriend, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Whitesun]]. Learning of his mother's peril, Skywalker took Owen's [[speeder bike]] to find her, and soon returned with her corpse, having recovered it from a Tusken village. C-3PO was present when he arrived, and later attended a funeral for Shmi on the farm's property. When R2-D2, who had been waiting aboard Amidala's nearby yacht, interrupted the funeral with an urgent message for the Padawan, C-3PO translated the astromech's [[binary]] beeps and whistles. After viewing the holocomm message, Skywalker and Amidala departed Tatooine for [[Geonosis]] to rescue Skywalker's Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, taking Threepio with them.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n[[File:3POGeonosis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|C-3PO during the Battle of Geonosis]]\nThus, C-3PO would become both a witness and participant in the subsequent [[First Battle of Geonosis]], the first spark of the [[Clone Wars]], a conflict that would change the course of galactic history. After landing on Geonosis, C-3PO reluctantly followed R2-D2, Skywalker, and Amidala into the Geonosian droid foundry. After being trapped in the factory's conveyor belt system, C-3PO's head was separated from his body and grafted onto the chassis of a [[B1-series battle droid]]. Meanwhile, a [[Unidentified B1 battle droid (C-3PO)|B1 battle droid head]] was inserted onto Threepio's body. During the ensuing battle, both of C-3PO's \"bodies\" were knocked out during the fighting. Fortunately for him, he was promptly reattached to his rightful body by R2-D2. Following the events on Geonosis, C-3PO and R2-D2 attended Skywalker and Amidala's wedding in Naboo's Lake Country.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n====Serving Senator Amidala====\n[[File:Destroy_Malevolence.jpg|thumb|left|250px|C-3PO and Senator Amidala trying to escape the ''Malevolence'']]\nDuring the Clone Wars, C-3PO would serve Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the spouse of Anakin Skywalker, and was given a shiny [[gold]]-[[color]]ed plating to better suit his new role. On one occasion, Amidala was captured by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] uncle [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] during a mission to reopen communications with the [[Hutt]]s after Jabba's son [[Rotta]] was kidnapped by the Separatist leader [[Count]] [[Dooku]]. Amidala contacted C-3PO, who in turn contacted the [[Coruscant Guard]], which promptly raided [[Ziro's Palace]] and freed Amidala. Meanwhile, Skywalker and his Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] managed to rescue Rotta and return him safely to his father. C-3PO and his comrades' actions help the Republic win over Jabba, who later signed a favorable treaty with them.<ref name=\"TCW film\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref>\n\nFollowing the Rotta affair, C-3PO accompanied Senator Amidala on a mission to contact the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]]'s executive, who purportedly wanted to sue for peace. Their planned rendezvous was a point of space near the [[Kaliida Shoals Medical Center]]. Unknown to the two of them, this was a trap concocted by [[Darth Sidious]] and his apprentice Count Dooku. The Separatist military commander [[General]] [[Grievous]]'s flagship ''[[Malevolence]]'' had been damaged during a recent space battle and was unable to enter [[hyperspace]]. The Sith and Separatists hoped to use Senator Amidala as a hostage to extract leverage from the Republic commander Skywalker, who was pursuing the ''Malevolence''.<ref name=\"Destroy Malevolence\">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence}}</ref>\n\nAmidala's vessel was trapped in the Separatist warship's [[tractor beam]], but they broke free by exploding their vessel's engines. C-3PO and Amidala then sneaked aboard and contacted Skywalker for help. Skywalker along with Kenobi and R2-D2 boarded the ''Malevolence'' and made arrangements to rendezvous with C-3PO and the Senator at the warship's [[rail jet]] system. However, they were accosted by battle droids there, which prompted Amidala to shove C-3PO into a moving [[hovertrain]]. After the battle droids were neutralized, Kenobi began levitating C-3PO to safety, but the floating droid was hit full-on by a moving hover train, which was only halted when R2-D2 sliced into a computer terminal and shut it down. The sudden stop launched C-3PO onto a nearby platform, where he quickly regained his bearings and again began wandering the cruiser's corridors before being located by R2-D2. Together, the two droids escaped the ''Malevolence'' before the Separatist warship crashed into a nearby moon after being sabotaged by Skywalker.<ref name=\"Destroy Malevolence\" />\n\n====Mission to Rodia====\n[[File:Bombad_bg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|C-3PO and Representative Binks on Rodia]]\nFollowing their adventures on the ''Malevolence'', C-3PO along with Senator Amidala and the Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks traveled to [[Rodia]] to meet with her old friend Senator [[Onaconda Farr]]. Amidala's [[Mission to Rodia|mission]] was to ensure that the ailing [[Rodian]]s remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. While Threepio and Binks remained with Amidala's yacht on the landing platform, Senator Amidala went to meet Farr. An ill-fated attempt to contact local swamp creatures ended with some [[fruit]] being thrown into C-3PO's face. Unknown to Amidala, Farr had already struck a deal with the Separatist leader [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] of the Trade Federation.<ref name=\"Bombad Jedi\">{{TCW|Bombad Jedi}}</ref>\n\nC-3PO and Binks were soon confronted by several B1 battle droids. During the ensuing confrontation, Threepio became stuck to a [[magnetic hoist]] that collided with the Separatist battle droids, throwing them into the water below. While attempting to take off, Binks accidentally destroyed the yacht with the magnetic hoist. Threepio remained stuck to the hoist due to his metallic body, but Binks along with the yacht fell into the water below. C-3PO believed that Binks perished during the accident. However, Binks resurfaced and promptly released C-3PO from the hoist. While scouring through the wrecked yacht, Binks found and donned a Jedi robe.<ref name=\"Bombad Jedi\" />\n\nShortly, the two of them were separated again, and Threepio was captured by Separatist droids, who were ordered to march him to a dismantling center. However, C-3PO was rescued by Amidala, who destroyed his captors. She ordered C-3PO to send a distress signal to nearby Republic forces. Threepio succeeded in sending for help before being arrested by two more Separatist droids. Gunray then attempted to execute both Amidala and C-3PO but was foiled by Binks, who returned with a [[Kwazel Maw]] monster, which disposed of the Separatist droids. Senator Farr then turned on Gunray and arrested him, revealing that his collaboration with the Separatists had been a ruse to lure the Viceroy into a trap. Republic forces arrived on Rodia and promptly apprehended Gunray. Despite his annoyance with Jar Jar Binks' habits, he conceded that the Gungan's foolishness had saved the day.<ref name=\"Bombad Jedi\" />\n\n====Mission to Orto Plutonia====\n[[File:Chuchi_peace.png|thumb|left|250px|C-3PO played an important role in ending hostilities between the Pantorans and Talz]]\nLater, C-3PO and R2-D2 accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, and [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Rex]] on a mission to investigate the disappearance of a clone trooper force on the icy planet of [[Orto Plutonia]]. Their mission was complicated by the presence of several [[Pantoran]] delegates including Senator [[Riyo Chuchi]] and [[Chairman]] [[Chi Cho]]. The Pantorans claimed territorial sovereignty over Orto Plutonia even though it was supposedly devoid of sentient life. After discovering the dead clone troopers, the Jedi and Republic mission also discovered that a nearby Separatist base had been destroyed. They quickly deduced that a third force had been responsible for these two attacks.<ref name=\"Trespass\">{{TCW|Trespass}}</ref>\n\nLater, Skywalker and Kenobi discovered that Ord Plutonia was home to a species of primitive bipedal sentient beings called the [[Talz]]. After some difficulties, Kenobi and Skywalker established contact with the Talz and assured them that they had come in peace. The Talz [[chief]]tain [[Thi-Sen]] wanted the Republic to leave his people in peace and to withdraw their presence from the planet. After the Jedi had made contact with the Talz tribe, C-3PO and Cho joined them in meeting with Thi-Sen. However, the hard-line Chairman Chi Cho refused to treat the Talz as sentient beings and reiterated Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia, provoking conflict between the Pandorans and Talz.<ref name=\"Trespass\" />\n\nThe Jedi ended the fighting by convincing Senator Chuchi to contact the [[Pantoran Assembly]], which gave her the authority to negotiate peace with the Talz and to relieve Chairman Cho of his authority. C-3PO and his companions then accompanied Senator Chuchi to the scene of the fighting. There, C-3PO helped Chuchi to broker a truce with Thi-Sen, ending the Pandoran-Talz conflict. As a result of the fighting, the Pandorans ceded sovereignty over Plutonia to the Talz.<ref name=\"Trespass\" />\n\n====The Blue Shadow Virus crisis====\n{{Quote|With your permission, Senator Padm\u00e9, I would like to shut down before I get sensory overload.''\"<br />\"''Permission denied.|C-3PO and Amidala, while analyzing a captured Separatist tactical droid on Naboo|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)}}\n[[File:Tactical_droid_naboo.png|thumb|right|250px|C-3PO interrogating the tactical droid]]\nFollowing the discovery of a scouting party of Separatist battle droids on Naboo, C-3PO accompanied Senator Amidala and Representative Binks back to Naboo. Amidala had been summoned by Queen [[Neeyutnee]], who wanted to procure more military aid from the Republic. C-3PO questioned a captured [[T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|T-series tactical droid]], which had its [[photoreceptor]]s removed. After convincing the droid that it was aboard a Separatist starship, C-3PO gleaned that there was a secret Separatist facility on Naboo producing some sort of virus before Jar Jar Binks accidentally destroyed the droid. Despite this setback, Binks and Amidala discovered a [[slug-beetle]] and mud from a swamp, which led them to Naboo's [[Eastern swamps]].<ref name=\"Blue Shadow Virus\">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)}}</ref>\n\nWhile Threepio stayed behind on [[Theed]] with [[Captain]] [[Gregar Typho]] to examine data from the captured Separatist droids, Amidala and Binks ventured into the swamps and discovered a secret Separatist research facility headed by the [[scientist]] [[Doctor]] [[Nuvo Vindi]]. Vindi was developing a deadly bioweapon called the [[Blue Shadow Virus]] for the Separatists. C-3PO and Typho discovered a [[hologram]] of Dr. Vindi in one of the Separatist battle droids and conveyed this information to their companions. With the aid of a local Gungan farmer named [[Peppi Bow]], Skywalker, Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, and several [[clone trooper]]s, Amidala and Skywalker succeeded in apprehending Dr. Vindi and stopping him from releasing his bioweapon.<ref name=\"Mystery of a Thousand Moons\">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>\n\n====The Senate hostage crisis====\n[[File:ThreepioTortured-EP.png|thumb|left|250px|C-3PO being tortured by Cad Bane]]\nWhen Senator Amidala was organizing a party for Senator [[Aang]], she sent Threepio and R2-D2 to buy some [[jogan fruit]] that Artoo had forgotten to buy for garnishing the [[jogan fruitcake]], Aang's favorite dessert. In the [[lower market districts]], the two droids grumbled and C-3PO was swindled by a fruit vendor. Following the purchase, another [[droid]] approached C-3PO and R2-D2 and suggested that they visit [[Droid Spa]] for a cosmetic overhaul. While R2-D2 visited the facility, C-3PO was kidnapped by the Separatist-aligned [[Duros]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]]'s droid henchmen, [[Todo 360]] and [[HELIOS-3E]].<ref name=\"Evil Plans\" />\n\nThreepio was taken to Bane's hideout in an industrial district on Coruscant, where his [[databank]]s were scanned for information on the [[Galactic Senate Building|Senate Building's]] layout. While C-3PO's databank yielded no such information, he mentioned that his astromech counterpart R2-D2 might have the information. Bane's droid henchmen promptly kidnapped R2-D2 and brought him to Bane. After Bane extracted the necessary information from Artoo's databanks, he ordered that the two droids be given a [[memory wipe]] and returned to the place where they had been snatched.<ref name=\"Evil Plans\" />\n\nFollowing the unpleasant shopping trip, C-3PO and R2-D2 returned to Amidala with their purchase. Both droids were completely unaware of what had befallen them. The jogan fruit was added to Senator Aang's dessert, as planned. Meanwhile, Bane delivered the plans from Artoo's memory banks to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. The Hutt crime lord ordered Bane to free his uncle Ziro from prison, since he knew information that would endanger the Hutts, who were nominally working with the Republic. Bane hatched a plan to rescue Ziro.<ref name=\"Evil Plans\" />\n\nFollowing his kidnapping and mind-wipe, C-3PO and Senator Amidala were caught up in the [[Senate hostage crisis]]. Cad Bane and several other [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] infiltrated the Senate Building and took Amidala, Threepio, Skywalker and several senators hostage in a bid to force a pardon for the imprisoned Ziro. These senators had been meeting to discussed the proposed [[Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill]]. Despite the Republic honoring Bane's demands, Bane planted several explosives in the hall with the aim of killing the senators. Skywalker saved the day by using his lightsaber to cut a hole around the group, moments before the explosives went off.<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>\n\n====The Separatist spy====\n[[File:Advicefromthemaster.png|thumb|right|250px|C-3PO advises Amidala and Rush Clovis on Cato Neimoidia.]]\nC-3PO was briefly reunited with R2-D2 when the two droids accompanied their masters Senator Amidala and General Skywalker on a [[Mission to Cato Neimoidia|mission]] to [[Cato Neimoidia]]. The quartet were accompanying [[Rush Clovis]], the representative from [[Scipio]] and a delegate representing the InterGalactic Banking Clan in the Senate. The Jedi Council suspected that Clovis was secretly spying for the Separatists and sent Skywalker and Amidala to spy on him. During the journey, C-3PO noticed Skywalker's hostile behavior towards Clovis, who was trying to flirt with his secret wife Amidala.<ref name=\"Senate Spy\">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving on Cato Neimoidia, the delegation was greeted by the Trade Federation's Senator [[Lott Dod]], who tried unsuccessfully to force Clovis to lend more money for the Separatist cause. When Dod deduced that Clovis was infatuated with Senator Amidala, he arranged for her to be [[poison]]ed during a formal dinner. Despite this, Amidala succeeded in stealing a [[hologram disc]] which confirmed that Clovis was indeed working for the Separatists. After Amidala began to succumb to the effects of the poisoning, C-3PO and a [[2-1B-series medical droid]] attended to the Senator in her quarters.<ref name=\"Senate Spy\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Clovis learned that Amidala was spying on him and went to confront her only to be cornered by Skywalker. Realizing that Skywalker loved Amidala, Clovis offered to get the antidote in return for receiving back the holodisk. C-3PO and his companions brought Amidala back to their ship but were cornered by Dod and his aides. Clovis attempted to bluff his way out, but Dod refused to let them leave. After Clovis pulled a blaster and forced Dod to hand over the antidote, C-3PO and his companions fled aboard Amidala's ship. They fled into space but left Clovis behind to face Dod alone.<ref name=\"Senate Spy\" />\n\n====Serving a Peacemaker====\nAs the Clone Wars dragged on, C-3PO continued serving Senator Amidala, who was becoming an active member of a group of Senators that supported diplomacy and opposed the expansion of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. On one occasion, C-3PO accompanied Senator Amidala and Master Kenobi when they presented evidence in the Galactic Senate that the planet [[Mandalore]] wished to be neutral. As a result, the Senate rescinded an earlier vote calling for a military occupation of Mandalore.<ref name=\"Duchess of Mandalore\">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref>\n\nLater, Senator Amidala and her supporters including the [[Alderaan]]ian Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and the Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr proposed a [[Reduced military spending bill|bill calling for the reduction of military spending]]. C-3PO attended several meetings of this informal peace coalition in Senator Amidala's office. On one such occasion, C-3PO was serving drinks when Senator Farr suffered an apparent heart attack and died. Threepio and Amidala attended the funeral of Senator Farr. Later, Amidala and Organa discovered that Farr had been poisoned by his aide [[Lolo Purs|Lolo Purrs]], who blamed the late Senator for bringing the war to Rodia.<ref name=\"Senate Murders\">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref>\n\n====The Zillo Beast====\nFollowing the Republic's [[Battle of Malastare|victory]] at [[Malastare]], Chancellor Palpatine ordered the Jedi Generals Windu and Skywalker to transport the [[Zillo Beast]], a gargantuan monster that had been captured and sedated during the fighting. After learning that a lightsaber could not harm the beast, Palpatine enlisted the services of the scientist [[Sionver Boll]] to study the beast's scales in order to develop a new type of armor for the Grand Army. Palpatine also planned to kill the monster with [[Malastarian fuel]] after it had outlived its usefulness.<ref name=\"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back\">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\nSenator Amidala learned about Palpatine's plan and arranged a meeting with Skywalker and Kenobi. During the meeting, C-3PO had another brief reunion with his astromech counterpart, R2-D2. Amidala succeeded in convincing her husband Skywalker and the delegation met with Chancellor Palpatine and [[Vice Chair]] [[Mas Amedda]]. However, the Zillo Beast escaped Boll's laboratory at the same time and proceeded to wreak havoc on the streets of Coruscant. Sensing that Palpatine was a Sith, the Zillo Beast made its way to the Galactic Senate building. C-3PO assisted in the evacuation of staff from the building and guided them to an executive ship that was piloted by a [[Senate Commando]].<ref name=\"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back\" />\n\n[[File:C3POR2D2zillo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|C-3PO and R2-D2 escape from the rampaging Zillo Beast on Coruscant.]]\nBefore they could flee to safety, the ship was grabbed by the Zillo Beast, but Skywalker used his lightsaber to cleave the vessel in half, sending the bow along with C-3PO and the other passengers plummeting into the Senate Building. C-3PO hitched a ride aboard R2-D2, who had used a tow cable to attach himself to the other side of the building. However, R2-D2 was forced to rescue Chancellor Palpatine and activated his booster rockers, leaving C-3PO behind. The protocol droid lost hold of the cable and fell to the floor of the Senate building. Shortly thereafter, the Zillo Beast was killed by [[gas bomb]]s fired from [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|LAAT gunships]]. C-3PO survived the Zillo Beast incident and continued serving Senator Amidala.<ref name=\"The Zillo Beast Strikes Back\" />\n\n====Staying behind====\nC-3PO stayed behind on [[Coruscant]] while R2-D2 accompanied Anakin Skywalker and Master Kenobi on a [[Battle of Lola Sayu|mission]] to rescue Jedi Master [[Even Piell]] from the [[Citadel]] [[prison]] on the planet [[Lola Sayu]]. C-3PO was initially alarmed when he saw R2-D2 flanked by three reprogrammed B1 battle droids. Threepio told R2-D2 not to get \"uppity\" about commanding new battle droids before parting company.<ref name=\"The Citadel\">{{TCW|The Citadel}}</ref>\n\n====Mission to Aleen====\n{{Quote|Hey Shiny! You two finished with those repairs on the computer system?''\"<br />\"''My good sir. You may not realize it, but we have been on quite an adventure.|A clone trooper and C-3PO, while on Aleena|Mercy Mission (episode)}}\n[[File:Epguide405.jpg|thumb|right|300px|C-3PO and R2-D2 meet the Kindalo.]]\nC-3PO and R2-D2 later took part in a mercy mission to the Mid Rim planet of [[Aleen]], which was experiencing a series of catastrophic global earthquakes. C-3PO served as the translator for the Republic mission led by [[Clone Commander]] [[Wolffe]] while his astromech counterpart Artoo-Detoo was tasked with interfacing with the equipment. Threepio's arrival coincided with a brief aftershock during which he tried to calm the local villages. When the aftershock stopped, the Aleena thought that the golden droid was some sort of divine messenger and asked the Republic soldiers to put the earth to rest, a request that Wolffe reluctantly had to acquiesce to.<ref name=\"Mercy Mission\">{{TCW|Mercy Mission (episode)|Mercy Mission}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mission, C-3PO translated while Wolffe explained the function of the Republic's delivered supplies to the [[Aleena]] King [[Manchucho]]. Later, C-3PO accompanied R2-D2 and several clone troopers as they entered the local Republic communications station to survey and repair the damage caused by the earthquakes. There, the Aleena villagers led C-3PO and R2-D2 into a collapsed structure, which contained a huge golden seal embedded into the ground. The seal turned out to be the entrance to a tunnel that led to the subterranean regions of Aleen. When another earthquake struck the area, C-3PO and R2-D2 fell into the tunnel and were separated from the clone troopers.<ref name=\"Mercy Mission\" />\n\nWhile exploring the underground tunnels, C-3PO and R2-D2 encountered a species of sentient, [[tree]]-like beings called the [[Kindalo]], who demanded that they leave since the surface dwellers \"destroyed the peace.\" After C-3PO convinced the Kindalo that they bore no ill will and had come to help with the earthquakes, the Kindalo sent the droids to meet [[Orphne]], a reptilian humanoid with mystical powers. Orphne told the two droids that a mutual balance had previously existed between the Aleena and the subterranean world. Since Aleena's atmosphere was toxic to them, the underground dwellers depended on a filtering process of the planet's soil that made the air breathable for them. The underground dwellers had set off this earthquake as a means of sealing the breach.<ref name=\"Mercy Mission\" />\n\nWhen C-3PO agreed to help fix the damage, Orphne gave the droids a parting riddle. R2-D2 quickly deduced that Orphne was referring to a river and used the water seal to activate a water spout that sent the two droids and the chamber's central floor plate back to the surface. The two droids landed at the opening where they were greeted by a chanting crowd of Aleena. Recalling the riddle, Threepio quickly realized that only he and R2-D2 were able to seal the breach, which was in fact the unsettled seal. Together, the two droids closed the seal and brought an end to Aleena's earthquakes. While Wolffe and his clone troopers were skeptical of their story, the two droids' efforts were greatly appreciated by the Aleena.<ref name=\"Mercy Mission\" />\n\n====Further adventures====\n[[File:Lilliputians.jpg|thumb|left|250px|C-3PO and R2-D2 encounter the pint-sized Patitites.]]\nFollowing the events on Aleen, C-3PO and R2-D2 were caught up in a second adventure that took them to [[Patitite Pattuna]], [[Balnab]], and the pirate ship [[Marauder (Weequay pirate ship)|''Marauder'']]. While traveling aboard the Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]'s Star Destroyer, their starship was attacked by three Separatist cruisers led by General Grievous. C-3PO and R2-D2 escaped the stricken vessel aboard a [[BTL Y-wing starfighter|Y-wing starfighter]] and crash-landed on the nearby planet of Patitite Pattuna.<ref name=\"Nomad Droids\">{{TCW|Nomad Droids}}</ref>\n\nOn Pattuna, they were captured by the indigenous [[Patitite]]s, who brought them before their obese leader [[Hay-Zu]]. During their meeting, R2-D2 accidentally toppled the tyrannical overlord much to the joy of the Patitites, who released their prisoners and allowed the two droids to leave on their Y-wing. With their starfighter's power systems damage, C-3PO and R2-D2 landed on another planet called Balnab. The indigenous [[Balnab (group)|Balnabs]] captured the two droids and brought them before their leader, who turned out to be a holo-projection created by a group of rogue [[DUM-series pit droid|pit droids]]. These pit droids had enslaved the Balnabs. After R2-D2 exposed the scam, the Balnabs rebelled against their droid overlords.<ref name=\"Nomad Droids\" />\n\n[[File:BlastOff-SWL.png|thumb|right|250px|R2-D2 rescued C-3PO from the Separatist incinerator]]\nC-3PO and R2-D2 took the opportunity to escape and resume their search for a replacement power unit for their Y-wing starfighter. Low on power, the two droids were captured by a band of [[Weequay]] pirates, who wanted to use them as gladiators. However, the Weequay's pirate ship ''Marauder'' was attacked by General Grievous' cruiser. During the bombardment, C-3PO and R2-D2 were sucked out of the ''Marauder'' by a hull-breach. R2-D2 used his rocket boosters to bring him and C-3PO aboard Grievous' ship. Grievous ordered the two droids to be melted down in his incinerator but they were rescued by a Republic fleet led by Master [[Plo Koon]], who had come to rescue Master Gallia. C-3PO and R2-D2 were subsequently rescued by Plo Koon's forces and resumed their services to Senator Amidala and General Skywalker respectively.<ref name=\"Nomad Droids\" />\n\n===Rise of the Empire===\n{{Quote|I feel so helpless.|C-3PO at the end of the Clone Wars|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\nFollowing the [[Battle of Coruscant]], C-3PO joined the Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] and the [[Galactic Senate]]'s [[Loyalist Committee]] in greeting R2-D2 and his Jedi companions Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi following their successful mission to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who had been kidnapped by the Separatist [[General]] [[Grievous]]. C-3PO would continue serving Senator Amidala during the last days of the Galactic Republic and the [[Great Jedi Purge]], which ushered in the [[Galactic Empire]]. He also accompanied his master to [[Mustafar]] and piloted the skiff, allowing some reprieve for Amidala, who was distraught at her husband's turn to the [[dark side of the Force]] and his role in the murder of Jedi [[youngling]]s at the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n[[File:Threepio-19bby.jpg|thumb|left|250px|C-3PO and Senator Amidala near the end of the Clone Wars]]\nUnknown to him and Amidala, Skywalker's former Master Obi-Wan Kenobi had stowed aboard the skiff. On Mustafar, Kenobi's presence enraged Skywalker, who [[Force choke]]d his wife. While Kenobi dueled his former Padawan, C-3PO and R2-D2 attended to the ailing Senator and brought her back aboard the skiff. After Kenobi defeated Skywalker, he and C-3PO piloted the skiff to [[Polis Massa]], a remote [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] world, where she gave birth to twins, a boy named [[Luke Skywalker]] and a daughter named [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], before passing away. While the Skywalker twins were spirited away to different locations to hide them from the Empire, C-3PO and R2-D2 passed into the ownership of Padm\u00e9's friend Bail Organa, the Senator for [[Alderaan]]. Due to Threepio's talkative nature, Senator Organa made arrangements for the protocol droid to receive a memory wipe in order to keep Leia's true parentage a secret.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n===Age of the Empire===\n====R2-D2's solo mission====\nA [[18 BBY|year]] after the Clone Wars, C-3PO served aboard Senator Organa's [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]'', which was captained by Captain [[Raymus Antilles]]. When R2-D2 returned from a solo mission to rendezvous with the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and bring her to Senator Organa, C-3PO berated his astromech companion. Following the [[Raada Uprising|evacuation of Raada]], Ahsoka Tano subsequently joined Senator Organa's [[Bail Organa's resistance movement|rebel movement]] and became the spymaster known as \"[[Fulcrum]].\"<ref name=\"Ahsoka\">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref>\n\n====Mission to Garel====\n{{Quote|I am C-3PO and this is my counterpart, R2-D2. I was translating for Minister Tua when we were attacked by thieves like, uh, you.|C-3PO, introducing himself to the Spectres|Droids in Distress}}\n[[File:Droids_in_Distress.png|thumb|right|250px|C-3PO and R2-D2 on their mission to Garel]]\nAbout five years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Senator Bail Organa sent C-3PO and his astromech counterpart R2-D2 to escort the Imperial [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]] and the [[Aqualish]] arms dealer [[Amda Wabo]] to the planet [[Garel]]. Minister Tua wanted to obtain a shipment of [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s, illicit weapons which had been banned by the [[Imperial Senate]] following the brutal [[Siege of Lasan|pacification]] of [[Lasan]]. She intended to mass-produce the weapons on [[Lothal]], a formerly backwater Outer Rim world that had become a manufacturing base for the Empire. Since Tua could not speak the [[Aqualish (language)|Aqualish language]], C-3PO was assigned the job of acting as her translator. Unknown to C-3PO, but known to R2-D2, their true mission was to prevent the T-7 ion disruptors from falling into Imperial hands.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\nUpon arriving in Lothal, C-3PO and his companions boarded the [[Star Commuter 2000]] [[shuttle]] [[ST-45]], which ferried them to Garel. Unknown to C-3PO, members of a [[Spectres|Lothalian rebel cell]] were also traveling on the shuttle. Two of rebels, the [[human]] teenager [[Ezra Bridger]] and the astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]] created a noisy ruckus. Another rebel, the former [[Jedi]] [[Kanan Jarrus]] pretended to be irate and demanded that the petulant Chopper be sent to the back of the shuttle. The [[RX-24|pilot]] complied, but in retaliation Bridger demanded that Tua's droids be sent to the back as well. Despite Tua's and C-3PO's protests, the protocol droid and his astromech counterpart were forced to move to the rear compartment.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\nBereft of a translator, Tua was forced to turn to the [[Mandalorian]] girl [[Sabine Wren]], who posed as an [[Imperial Academy]] student fluent in Aqualish. However, Wren was also a member of the Lothalian rebel cell that was planning to deliver the shipment of weapons to the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]]. Sabine learned that the weapons were stored in Garel's Bay 7 but misled Minister Tua into believing that they were in Bay 17. After the shuttle landed in Garel's [[spaceport]], C-3PO and R2-D2 accompanied Minister Tua and a force of [[stormtrooper]]s to Bay 17. When they found nothing, C-3PO explained that Sabine might have accidentally mistranslated \"Bay 7\" as \"Bay 17.\"<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\nWhile traveling to Bay 7, C-3PO's counterpart R2-D2 was accosted by Chopper, who had been sent to distract the Imperials. Chopper rammed himself right into R2-D2, then shook his arm in apparent anger. In response, R2-D2 whipped out his electroshock prod, but did not use it as C-3PO ordered him to apologize. But Minister Tua recognized Chopper from the shuttle ride to Garel and ordered her stormtrooper guards to hurry to Bay 7. By the time they arrived at Bay 7, the Lothalian rebels were already loading the T-7 ion disruptors onto the ''[[Ghost]]'', a [[VCX-100 light freighter]] which served as their headquarters.\n\nA blaster fight broke out, and in the ensuing confusion C-3PO and R2-D2 fled aboard the ''Ghost'', which fled into hyperspace. The two droids were then taken prisoner by the Lothalian rebels, who placed [[restraining bolt]]s on both of them.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\nThe Lothalian rebels traveled back to Lothal to sell their stolen weapons to Vizago at a pre-arranged rendezvous point. Despite his restraining bolts, C-3PO managed to used the ship's intercom to contact the Imperial authorities, telling that he and his astromech counterpart had been kidnapped by \"criminals.\" The [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] answered his transmission and promised that \"help\" was on the way. Using C-3PO's transmission to trace the ''Ghost''{{'s}} coordinates, Agent Kallus brought an Imperial attack force consisting of a [[Gozanti-class cruiser]], two [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP]] [[walker]]s, and several stormtroopers to the Lothalian rebels' meeting place. Mistaking the Imperials for \"friends,\" C-3PO approached them but was fired upon and narrowly escaped disintegration. Meanwhile, R2-D2 helped the Lothalian rebels to overload and destroy the T-7 disruptors.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\nFollowing the brief skirmish, both droids and the rebels managed to escape their Imperial pursuers. The rebels also returned C-3PO and R2-D2 to their rightful owner, Senator Organa, who paid them some [[credit]]s for destroying the weapons. Due to the stress of his adventures at Garel and Lothal, C-3PO requested that he be allowed to rest for a while, which the Senator obliged. Senator Organa then questioned R2-D2 about the Lothalian rebels.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n{{Quote|Scarif? They're going to Scarif?

Unbeknownst to C-3PO, Darth Vader was actually his former master, Anakin Skywalker. The ''Tantive IV'' was crippled by a laser blast from Vader's ship, and Imperial stormtroopers boarded the vessel.

During his walk, C-3PO walked beside the skeleton of a [[Krayt dragon]]. Both were reunited onboard a [[Sandcrawler]], after being captured by [[Jawa]]s, who sold them to a family of moisture farmers; C-3PO was chosen as a moisture vaporator programmer and for having [[Bocce]] among his languages, and recommended buying R2-D2 after the first chosen [[R5-D4]] had a motivator malfunction. This family turned out to be Owen Lars, his wife Beru, and their adopted nephew Luke Skywalker, the son of Anakin Skywalker. While C-3PO settled down to his new home, R2-D2 wanted to continue his mission to find Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unable to resolve their differences, R2-D2 escaped into the Jundland Wastes. Skywalker followed him in a [[landspeeder]] piloted by C-3PO and caught up with R2-D2. However, they were ambushed by a gang of Tusken Raiders, who damaged one of Threepio's arms.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" />\n\nC-3PO and his companions were rescued by Master Kenobi, who brought them to his dwelling. Kenobi revealed Skywalker's Jedi heritage and passed him his [[Skywalker lightsaber|father's lightsaber]], telling the boy that Anakin had been murdered by another apprentice named Darth Vader.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" /> After discovering Princess Leia's message in R2-D2's compartments, Kenobi attempted to persuade Luke to accompany him to Alderaan, Princess Leia's homeworld. Skywalker was initially reluctant until he discovered that Imperial stormtroopers had murdered his relatives and razed their moisture farm. Later, C-3PO and his companions traveled to the spaceport of [[Mos Eisley]] with the intention of finding passage to Alderaan.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" />\n\nUpon arriving in the settlement, they were stopped by a stormtrooper patrol. However, Kenobi used a Jedi [[mind trick]] to convince the stormtroopers to give them free passage through the town. C-3PO and R2-D2 were not allowed allowed to enter [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] due to a rule banning droids. While Kenobi and Skywalker negotiated with the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] and his [[Wookiee]] co-pilot [[Chewbacca]], Threepio and R2-D2 wandered the streets of Mos Eisley and narrowly evaded a stormtrooper patrol. Later, C-3PO and R2-D2 boarded Han Solo's ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and fled into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" />\n\n====Stopping the Death Star====\n{{Quote|Hang on tight, R2.

The ''Millennium Falcon'' was then trapped in the tractor beam of the Death Star. Hiding under the freighter's cargo compartments, they managed to ambush an Imperial scanning team and two stormtroopers. The rebels then seized control of an Imperial control room. While Threepio and R2-D2 stayed behind to watch the ''Falcon'', the other rebels split into two groups. Disguised as stormtroopers, Skywalker and Solo along with their Wookiee \"prisoner\" Chewbacca went to [[Detention Block AA-23]] to free Princess Leia.

The Imperials quickly realized that the rebels were trapped in the garbage chute and proceeded to crush the chamber. Meanwhile, Threepio and R2-D2 narrowly escaped an Imperial patrol by claiming that the rebels had thrown them into the storage compartment. Once the Imperials had gone, the two droids were contacted by Skywalker, who ordered them to shut down the garbage compactor. R2-D2 succeeded in shutting down the garbage compactor just in time. However, amidst the muffled cries of joy over the [[comlink]], Threepio initially believed that they had died. After grappling with more stormtroopers, the other rebels and the Princess managed to return to their hangar bay.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" />\n\nMaster Kenobi shut down the tractor-beam projector but was cornered by his former apprentice, Darth Vader, on the way back. While Kenobi gave his life, C-3PO and the other rebels took the opportunity to flee the Death Star on the ''Millennium Falcon''. After dispatching several pursuing [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], C-3PO and his companions escaped to the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where the rebels maintained a base. Using the Death Star plans stored in R2-D2's systems, the rebels discovered that the massive superweapon contained a weak point: an unprotected shaft. While Skywalker, R2-D2 and a Rebel strike force assailed the station, C-3PO remained with Princess Leia at the rebel command center on Yavin 4.

Cymoon 1 was a moon in the [[Corellian Industrial Cluster]], and [[Weapons Factory Alpha]]&mdash;the largest [[weapons factory]] in the galaxy&mdash;was the main target of the assault. Chewbacca and 3PO piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' through the debris fields that surrounded Cymoon 1, and landed in the huge [[Cymoon 1 refuse fields|refuse fields]] that fenced in the factory. Chewbacca left the relative safety of the ''Falcon'' and hiked towards the factory, while 3PO stayed behind to wait for the signal to begin the ''Falcon''{{'s}} autopilot when the team had achieved their objective of hacking into the main power core and rigging it to explode. The ''Falcon'' would swoop in and pick up Han, Leia, Luke, and R2 while Chewbacca covered their retreat from a large metal structure that overlooked the rendezvous escape point&mdash;before he too escaped aboard the freighter.<ref name=\"SW1\" />\n\nThe team was posing as an envoy from Jabba the Hutt, due to Han's previous ties to the crime lord. Leia (who was disguised as one of the Hutt's bodyguards) contacted 3PO and Chewbacca via comlink and notified them that they were entering the factory. 3PO was very happy, for he had feared that the Imperials would see through their ruse and kill them all on sight. 3PO also noted that the tide of war seemed to be in their favor after the destruction of the Death Star&mdash;3PO had a \"very good feeling about this.\" A short time later Leia and Han contacted 3PO and let the droid know that the plan had moved to phase two. Han was worried about leaving 3PO alone on his ship, but 3PO assured him all was in working order&mdash;but was concerned that the old [[YT-1300 light freighter]] continued to so easily be mistaken for garbage.<ref name=\"SW1\" />\n\n3PO received a comlink call several minutes later from Han, who told 3PO to start the autopilot so they could begin their escape. 3PO activated the autopilot&mdash;but nothing happened. About five minutes later Han again contacted the droid. 3PO told him what had happened. 3PO looked out of the [[transparisteel]] cockpit of the ''Falcon'' and noticed several [[Unidentified Cymoon 1 species|scavengers]] dismantling the ''Falcon''. Han ordered 3PO to take a [[blaster pistol]] and go stop them.

She told the droid that they were going to die if the ''Falcon'' did not soon reach them. 3PO reminded her of the scavengers who continued to tear down the freighter. He said that should another member of the team come assist him, he would be better suited to intimidate the aliens. But Leia became angry and ordered the droid to \"Do whatever you have to.\" 3PO gave in&mdash;for it was the House of Organa that he served. 3PO took the blaster pistol and addressed the tentacled aliens in Basic, requesting they \"at once return to your domiciles,\" If they would not, 3PO would not hesitate to use force&mdash;in the form of the blaster pistol. The protocol droid fumbled and dropped the blaster, which fell at the feet of one creature. 3PO realized he'd made a mistake and surrendered. The creature examined it and shot 3PO in the chest. The super-heated gas did no real damage to 3PO's golden chest plate&mdash;but the kinetic energy of the blast blew off the droid's arms and legs. The aliens gathered up 3PO as Han called him and asked what he'd done to the ''Falcon''. The droid asked if he could \"close down for a while...\" But due to the droid's injuries, Han was unable to hear the golden droid as he was carried off by the tentacled aliens.<ref name=\"SW2\">[[Star Wars (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' (2015) 2]]</ref>\n\nThe scavengers stuffed 3PO into a sack, and he was carried on one of the alien's backs. As a result of the attack, 3PO sustained a memory relapse and believed himself to be talking with Captain Antilles. He requested a peaceful diplomatic mission from \"Antilles\" before the alien he was strapped to was hoisted into the air and thrown by the mighty Chewbacca. Chewbacca blasted the other scavengers while 3PO confessed to \"Antilles\" that he cared for neither action or adventure. The aliens fled while the Wookiee went to work repairing the damage they had caused to the ''Falcon'' so he and the droid could go rescue the other team members, who were under attack by Darth Vader. 3PO heard through Chewbacca's comm, that Han and Leia were doomed. 3PO was just grateful his eye circuits were not connected so he wouldn't have to witness their deaths.<ref name=\"SW3\">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref>\n\nBut they were not killed, for Chewbacca repaired the freighter, gathered up 3PO, and flew the ''Falcon'' to pick up the other team members. The ''Falcon'' fled into hyperspace as the golden droid admitted to \"Antilles\" that the mission had been the strangest diplomatic mission he'd ever experienced.<ref name=\"SW3\" />\n\nWithin two days, the ''Millennium Falcon'' and its complement rendezvoused with the Rebel Fleet<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref> on the edge of the galaxy.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\">[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]</ref> The team was treated for their wounds, and was debriefed by the Alliance leadership. Threepio was completely repaired by Alliance engineers. Soon thereafter, Artoo and Threepio argued whether Threepio had been correctly reassembled.

When Skywalker did not return from a patrol, Threepio and R2-D2 were deeply worried about the safety of their master. Han Solo departed on a [[tauntaun]] to rescue Skywalker, who had been attacked by a [[wampa]]. When R2-D2 calculated that Skywalker had a very poor chance of survival in the frozen wilderness, C-3PO tried to cheer up the others by assuring them that R2-D2 had been known to make mistakes from time to time. The following day, Skywalker and Solo were rescued by a Rebel patrol of [[T-47 airspeeder|snowspeeders]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\nWhile Skywalker recovered in the base hospital, C-3PO visited his master to wish him well. After Solo and Chewbacca encountered an [[XJ9-CS14|Imperial probe droid]], the Rebel Alliance ordered a mass evacuation of their Hoth base. While the Rebels' [[ion cannon]] and ground forces held back the advancing Imperial fleet and ground forces, Rebel transports began fleeing the Imperial blockade into hyperspace. During the [[Battle of Hoth]], an Imperial ground invasion against the forces of Echo Base in the midst of the evacuation, Threepio fled through the halls with Solo and Organa,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" /> though he was eventually spotted by some of Vader's [[Cold weather assault stormtrooper|snowtroopers]]. Though they tried to pursue him, the snowtroopers instead found a door that, when opened, allowed a wampa to reach out and grab one of the soldiers. Unknown to them, the warning sign on this door had been ripped off. Sensing the rebels nearby, Vader led his troops after them<ref name=\"Invasion of Echo Base\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=1|story=[[Tales of Villainy: Invasion of Echo Base]]}}</ref> as Threepio, Han, and Leia, unable to reach the transport they had been running to, made their way to Chewbacca and the ''Millennium Falcon'' to escape. When they were aboard, Vader,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" /> having deduced Solo would lead them to the ''Falcon'',<ref name=\"Invasion of Echo Base\" /> led his troops into the hangar, though one of the freighter's turrets fired on the invading troops before the ship, with C-3PO and the others safely aboard, blasted off.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" /> Nevertheless, Vader ordered Admiral [[Firmus Piett]] to catch the ship, believing he could use Luke Skywalker's friends to bring the young Jedi to him.<ref name=\"Invasion of Echo Base\" /> In space, learning they were unable to enter hyperspace, the ''Falcon''{{'s}} crew fled into the [[Hoth asteroid belt]] to lose their Imperial pursuers.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\nThe ''Millennium Falcon'' hid inside a deep cave, which turned out to be the innards of a giant [[Exogorth|space slug]]. While C-3PO and his fellow crew made repairs to the ''Falcon'', they encountered several parasitic creatures called [[Mynock]]s. Following an earthquake, the crew of the ''Falcon'' fled the cave only to discover that they been hiding inside a space slug. Unable to jump into hyperspace, the ''Falcon'' feigned a frontal attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer and hid behind the rear of the vessel's command tower. When Threepio protested their plan was suicide, Princess Leia switched him off. After escaping the Imperial fleet, the ''Millennium Falcon'' fled to [[Cloud City]], an orbital city in the gas giant of [[Bespin]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\nCloud City was run by an old friend of Han Solo called [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], a former gambler and businessman. Upon landing, C-3PO attempted to greet Calrissian but was rudely brushed aside. While exploring Cloud City, he heard the familiar beep of an R2 unit only to stumble across several Imperial stormtroopers, who promptly disabled him with a [[stun]] blaster. The Imperials gave C-3PO's body parts to several [[Ugnaught]] garbage disposal workers, who attempted to dismantle him. However, Chewbacca arrived in the nick of time and rescued the protocol droid from being disintegrated. Soon thereafter, Threepio's rebel companions were betrayed by Calrissian, who handed them over to Darth Vader and the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\n[[File:Reassemble-SoH.png|thumb|right|250px|Chewbacca worked to reassemble C-3PO while imprisoned.]]\nWhile imprisoned, Chewbacca was able to repair C-3PO's head, torso, and arms. Before he could reattach the protocol droid's legs, the rebels were summoned by Vader to a carbon-freezing chamber. There, Darth Vader intended to test Cloud City's carbon-freezing technology on Han Solo as part of his plot to lure Skywalker to Bespin. Despite initial fears that the process would kill Han, Threepio was mollified when he learned that Solo was merely hibernating. Vader then ordered Threepio and the remaining rebels to be taken to his flagship, the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]''. However, Lando reneged on his deal with the Empire and freed C-3PO and his companions. Reuniting with R2-D2, C-3PO and his rebel companions fled Cloud City aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', but not before warning the city's inhabitants that the Empire was occupying their city.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\nOn the way out, the rebels also rescued Luke Skywalker, who had lost his hand during a duel with Darth Vader. R2-D2 continued repairing Threepio aboard the ''Falcon'' but was forced to adjourn his repairs to fix the hyperdrive. After fixing the hyperdrive, the rebels escaped into hyperspace and linked up with the Rebel fleet.\n\n====Deliberation after escape====\nC-3PO fell witness to the argument between Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca following the group's escape from Cloud City. Upon Calrissian's remark that they had all lost something that day, Threepio remarked that he had lost his arms and legs, much to the others' annoyance. After the ''Falcon's'' return to the rebel fleet, Threepio, alongside Leia, discovered that the Empire had found a way to break the Rebellion's codes.<ref name=\"SW 2020 1\">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref>\n\nWhile with the fleet, Threepio, along with R2-D2 and Princess Leia visited Skywalker in the medical bay on a rebel ship. They watched out the window as Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca departed on the ''Falcon'' to rescue Solo from the bounty hunter Boba Fett.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\n====Rescuing Han Solo====\n[[File:ProdroidJabba.jpg|thumb|right|250px|C-3PO translating for Jabba]]\nLater, C-3PO and his rebel companions learned that Han Solo was in the hands of the Hutt crime lord Jabba, who lived in a well-fortified [[Jabba's Palace|desert palace]] on Tatooine. While Skywalker kept R2-D2 fully informed about his plans to rescue Solo, he kept Threepio in the dark because he knew of the protocol droid's inability to lie. C-3PO and R2-D2 traveled to Jabba's desert palace bringing a holographic message from Skywalker, who asked for Solo to be freed and offered the two droids as a gift. Jabba declined Skywalker's request and revealed that he had kept a carbonite Han on display as a trophy in his throne room. The two droids were dragooned in the Hutt crime lord's service; C-3PO ended up working as his [[translator]], while R2-D2 was relegated to working as a waiter on Jabba's sail barge ''[[Khetanna]]''.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" />\n\nLater, Jabba was visited by Princess Leia, posing as the bounty hunter [[Boushh]], who presented a captive Chewbacca. Unknown to Jabba, this was a ruse by Leia to infiltrate the castle and free Han from carbonite. Threepio served as a translator when Boushh and Jabba negotiated the sum for Chewbacca's bounty. After a near confrontation involving a [[thermal detonator]], Jabba and Boushh reached a compromise sum. After Chewbacca was taken to Jabba's cells, Leia briefly spoke with C-3PO and commended him. That night, Leia freed Han from carbonite, only for both of them to be captured by Jabba and his minions.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" />\n\nThe following day, Skywalker visited Jabba's palace and demanded that he free Han and his companions. Jabba refused and had Skywalker thrown down into his [[rancor]] pit. However, Skywalker killed the rancor, prompting an enraged Jabba to order that Skywalker, Solo, and Chewie be fed to the [[sarlacc]] that inhabited the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] in the [[Dune Sea]]. Before Skywalker could be thrown to the beast, R2-D2 managed to pass his [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|his lightsaber]] to him. Following a struggle, the rebels killed Jabba and most of his entourage. During the fighting, C-3PO was attacked by Jabba's pet [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] [[Salacious B. Crumb|Salacious Crumb]], who damaged one of his photoreceptors. R2-D2 rescued him. He and R2-D2 then dived into the Dune Sea. They were retrieved by their rebel companions, who fled the scene on a stolen [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|desert skiff]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" />\n\n====Battle of Endor====\n{{Quote|Princess Leia wassi waba Artoo&hellip;|C-3PO explains the Rebel Alliance's plight against the Galactic Empire.|audio=Threepio_story.ogg|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n[[File:ThreepioStoryteller-TOTS.jpg|thumb|left|300px|C-3PO tells the Ewoks about the struggle of the Rebellion against the Empire]]\nAfter rescuing Han Solo, C-3PO and his companions participated in a rebel mission to destroy the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] that was being built above the [[Endor|Forest Moon of Endor]]. Through [[Bothan]] spies, the Rebel leadership had learned that Emperor Palpatine would be visiting the Death Star to oversee the final stages of its completion. In response, the Rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]] and [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar|Ackbar]] had marshaled the Rebel fleet for a massive strike against the Imperial leadership. Since the second Death Star was protected by a [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]], a rebel force would have to infiltrate Endor and knock it out so that the Rebel fleet could destroy it.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" />\n\nC-3PO along with his companions R2-D2, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca took part in this Rebel mission to infiltrate Endor. Using a stolen [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]], the rebels landed on Endor. They soon encountered several Imperial [[scout trooper]]s, and Princess Leia was separated from the group during the struggle. C-3PO accompanied Han, Skywalker, and Chewbacca as they searched the forest for Leia. However, they stumbled into a trap laid by the [[Ewok]]s, a species of sentient furry bipeds native to Endor. The Ewoks had already befriended Leia and welcomed her as a guest. Believing that Threepio was a god, the Ewoks attempted to sacrifice Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and Artoo. When Threepio failed to dissuade the Ewoks, Skywalker used the Force to cause Threepio's throne to levitate. Fearing that they had angered their god, the Ewoks promptly released their prisoners.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" />\n\nLater that night, C-3PO convinced the Ewoks to fight on the side of the Rebels against the Imperial presence on Endor. The following day, C-3PO and R2-D2 took part in the Rebel assault on the [[Death Star's shield generator]]. However, the rebel force was quickly captured by the Imperial garrison. C-3PO and R2-D2 managed to evade capture. Under orders from R2-D2, Threepio exposed his position to the Imperials. Shortly, the Ewoks attacked the Imperial forces massed outside the shield generator. However, the Imperials managed to seal off the shield generator and launched a devastating counterattack with [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walkers]]. Meanwhile in space, the Rebel fleet was trapped between the Death Star and an Imperial fleet.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" />\n\n[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|right|300px|C-3PO and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Endor]]\nDuring the fighting, Threepio and R2-D2 made their way to the shield generator's blast door, where Han and Leia were attempting to breach it. R2-D2 attempted to access the power socket but was blasted by enemy fire, causing him to short-circuit. Threepio, Han, and Leia were then cornered by stormtroopers, but Leia managed to shoot them. Meanwhile, Chewbacca and two Ewok warriors turned the tide of the battle by hijacking an AT-ST walker and using it to destroy the others. Using the hijacked AT-ST, the rebels tricked the remaining Imperial troops into opening the shield generator. After storming the bunker, the rebels planted explosives, which destroyed the energy field protecting the Death Star. This enabled the Rebels to destroy the Death Star along with Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, and several Imperial ships. Following the [[Battle of Endor]], Threepio took part in the victory celebrations at [[Bright Tree Village]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\" />\n\n===New Republic===\n====Shattering the Empire====\nIn the morning after the Battle of Endor, C-3PO was present at Bright Tree Village when Han Solo and the [[Special Forces Trackers Unit|Pathfinders]] traveled to the far side of Endor to attack an [[Imperial outpost (Endor)|Imperial outpost]].<ref name=\"Shattered Empire 1\">[[Shattered Empire 1|''Shattered Empire'' 1]]</ref> Later, Threepio accompanied Han and Chewbacca on a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an Imperial Security Bureau black site at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]].

The Rebel Alliance was transformed into the New Republic, which became the dominant galactic government following the [[Battle of Jakku]] and the [[Galactic Concordance]]. The Galactic Empire disintegrated with the remnants of the Empire retreating into the [[Unknown Regions]], where they established the [[First Order]].<ref name=\"TFAVD\" /> About six years before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the [[Hosnian system]], C-3PO served the now-Senator Organa as an aide at the [[New Republic]]'s [[New Republic senatorial complex|senatorial complex]] on [[Hosnian Prime]]. Leia was a member of the [[Populists]], one of the two main factions in the [[New Republic Senate|Galactic Senate]]. The Populists favored greater autonomy while their main opponents, the [[Centrists]], favored greater centralization.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nThe protocol droid was present at a [[Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony|ceremony to dedicate a statue of Bail Organa]], the late adopted father of Leia. The following day, Threepio attended a senatorial meeting where Senator Leia and a Centrist Senator named [[Ransolm Casterfo]] agreed to investigate the [[Nikto]] crime lord [[Rinnrivin Di]]'s [[Rinnrivin Di's cartel|cartel]], which was interfering with trade on [[Ryloth]]. When C-3PO reminded Leia that proper protocol dictated that a junior senator always be the one to call upon the senior senator, Leia, a senior senator, responded that she would ignore protocol and initiate contact.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nThreepio accompanied Senator Organa, her entourage, and Senator Casterfo on Leia's personal starship ''[[Mirrorbright]]'' to the planet [[Bastatha]], which was home to [[Rinnrivin's headquarters]]. Prior to the Organa and Casterfo's meeting with [[Magistrate]] [[Tosta]] and [[Xun]], the protocol droid offered to record any conversations for posterity and assured them that he was fluent in seven million forms of communication. During the [[Mission to Bastatha|mission]], Leia was kidnapped by Rinnrivin, who attempted to bribe the Senator, but was rescued by Casterfo.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nAfter the Centrists passed a motion to create a new powerful office called [[First Senator]], C-3PO encouraged his master Leia not to resign from the Senate. He was also present during a meeting of Populist senators when Leia reluctantly agreed to stand as the Populist nominee for First Senator. Later, the protocol droid ushered several visitors into Leia's office including a group of lobbyists from the [[Association of Small Craft Manufacturers]], ore traders from [[Gad]], several Populist senators from the Outer Rim, and the Senator [[Lord|Lady]] [[Carise Sindian]] for meetings with Leia. During the last meeting, Leia agreed to support Lady Carise's claim for the [[Supreme governor]]ship of [[Birren]] due to her lack of interest in royal titles.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nC-3PO later accompanied Senator Organa on a trip to Ryloth to search the [[Ryloth archives]] for information about Rinnrivin and his cartel. During the trip, Threepio greeted Emissary [[Yendor]], whom he had first encountered during his time at [[Echo Base]]. The protocol droid recalled that the two had once worked together recalibrating the thermal units at the base precisely five days after they had arrived on Hoth. Yendor recalled working with C-3PO before entertaining Leia and her other staff members [[Korr Sella]] and [[Joph Seastriker]]. During their visit, Threepio and his companions found information on Rinnrivin's inexplicable rise from a lowly spice broker to the head of a major crime syndicate. They suspected that Rinnrivin was a front for other forces seeking to destabilize the New Republic.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Unmasking a conspiracy====\n{{Quote|We're bringing Threepio?''\"<br>\"''We'll want to slice into the central computer core.

As a result, they found that Rinnrivin was hiding on the [[Expansion Region]] world of [[Sibensko]]. After skipping Senator [[Varish Vicly]]'s gala, C-3PO accompanied his master to [[Harloff Minor]], where Leia arranged for a private meeting with Rinnrivin on neutral ground. While approaching Hosnian Prime, the protocol droid helped Senator Organa sift through her communiques, starting with the high-priority messages. One of these messages was from Senator Casterfo, who had been investigating a paramilitary group known as the [[Amaxine warriors (New Republic Era)|Amaxine warriors]] on [[Daxam IV]].<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nLater, C-3PO convinced Leia to delay her trip to Sibensko so that she could prepare for a Senate hearing on her nomination for First Senator. After an animated discussion, Leia accepted Threepio's advice and set the droid to work planning their trip. While Leia, her entourage, and Casterfo were planning their secret Sibensko trip, C-3PO pointed out that Leia's husband, Han Solo, was an occasional consumer of [[Port in a Storm]], a popular beverage. Later, Greer treated C-3PO to an [[oil bath]]. After Leia's true parentage as Darth Vader's daughter was exposed during the Senate hearing, C-3PO received orders not to let anyone into Leia's office with the exception of close friends. He also prepared Leia's [[holocam]] for his master to send a heartfelt message to her son [[Ben Solo]], who hitherto had been unaware of his true ancestry.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nAfter Senator Organa obtained leave from the Senate, C-3PO aided her [[Mission to Sibensko|mission]] to Sibensko by [[Slicer|slicing]] into the central computer core at the [[Sibensko complex|underwater city]] housing the Amaxine base. For that mission, Leia posed as an indentured servant of Joph and [[Greer Sonnel]] while Threepio pretended to be her guard. During the mission, C-3PO obtained banking records proving that the Amaxine Warriors and another mysterious entity were funnelling considerable funds into Rinnrivin's cartel. The protocol droid also discovered that the Amaxines had a large base in the underwater city. Leia instructed C-3PO to return with the data to Joph and Greer while she went to spy on the Amaxine base.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nWhile Threepio left with Joph and Greer on their freighter, Leia headed into the Amaxine base only to be cornered by the Amaxines. She managed to escaped with Han on a racer before an explosion from a fallen starfighter destroyed the underwater city and the base, destroying much of the physical evidence linking the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel. Despite this setback, Leia's tram succeeded in neutralizing a threat to the New Republic. Leia later presented the information from C-3PO's databanks to a special Senate hearing. While Leia was greeted with much hostility and disbelief, Senator Casterfo supported her by sharing evidence from his trip to Daxam IV.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nLater, Threepio ushered in Senator Casterfo for a private audience with Leia. The two had fallen out after Casterfo had exposed Leia's true parentage at the instigation of Lady Carise, who was secretly working for the First Order. Casterfo had regained Leia's trust and respect after he had spoken in support of her during the recent Senate hearing. Having withdrawn her nomination for First Senator, Leia made preparations to resign from the Galactic Senate.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n===Resistance===\n====Rescue of Admiral Ackbar====\nC-3PO found himself in the service of the [[Resistance]], a military force founded by Leia Organa to combat the First Order. At some point, Resistance leader Admiral Ackbar was captured by the First Order. In an attempt to rescue Ackbar, the Resistance sent a team led by Captain [[Hoff (Resistance captain)|Hoff]]. The team captured a First Order protocol droid named [[O-MR1]], referred to as Omri, who was believed to know where Ackbar was. However, the ship carrying the team crashed on [[Taul]] before it could return to the [[Resistance base]]. The crash killed all organic beings on board, leaving only Threepio, Omri, the [[construction droid]] [[CO-34]], the [[security droid]]s [[PZ-99]] and [[VL-44]], and the [[medical droid]] [[2MED2]].<ref name=\"The Phantom Limb\">[[Star Wars Special: C-3PO 1|''Star Wars Special: C-3PO'' 1]]</ref>\n\nShortly after the crash, the droids picked up a homing beacon signal from what they presumed was a crashed First Order vessel. Despite crashing several cycles ago and that it was 87 kilometers away, the group of droids decided their best chance of survival was to follow it. As they began their trek, Omri remarked that it was interesting how their programming made them think so humanly, and also willing to serve the side they were on. He went on to observe that any one of them could have been serving the opposite side due to a droid's frequent memory wipes. While on their way to the vessel, they were attacked by [[spice spider]]s. Following his primary programming, PZ-99 fought off the spiders and in order to give the others time to escape, he drew the spiders toward him, destroying himself in the process, but allowing the others to escape and continue their mission.<ref name=\"The Phantom Limb\" />\n\nAs they continued walking, Omri stated that he felt protocol droids such as he and Threepio were cursed to having their memories wiped, due to their need for an extra level of sentience. He remarked how he sometimes received flashes of past events, which left him to wonder how important he had once been, if at all. Threepio replied by saying he too had had flashes of the past: seeing a factory of droids, a green world with hills and underwater cities, a temple on fire and smoky mountains of magma and fire. Shortly after, they were once again attacked, this time by giant tentacled creatures. They began by ripping Toomedtoo apart and destroying CO-34. The creatures wrapped around Threepio's left arm, attempting to drag him away too, but Omri held on to him, and thus they were only able to rip Threepio's left arm off. Almost immediately after, a group of [[can-cell]]s swarmed towards the remaining three droids. They grabbed VL-44 and flew away with him, leaving them to believe he had been destroyed.<ref name=\"The Phantom Limb\" />\n\n[[File:C-3po_loses_an_arm.png|thumb|left|263px|C-3PO loses his arm]]\nThe only two left, Threepio and Omri continued walking as they exchanged attempts at humor. The two expressed that they wished that they were on the same side. Eventually they finally found two crashed [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE fighters]], but not before it began [[Acid rain|raining acid]]. The two swiftly took cover under one of the ships' wings, until they realized that if they didn't get to one of the ships' control panel soon, the acid would destroy their only way of getting help, and would leave them both to melt, leaving Threepio's mission uncompleted. Omri told C-3PO that there was nothing in his directive telling him to prevent him from completing his mission and transferred Admiral Ackbar's location to him. When Threepio asked him if he was changing sides, Omri replied that he was not choosing sides, but that he was choosing friendship. With that he started walking towards the ships' control panel in the acid rain, as he stated he would change the frequency to summon Threepio's master, so that at least he could survive. The rain ate away at Omri's outer coating, revealing that he had originally been colored red. He was able to send a distress signal to [[Poe Dameron]], although the acid rain caused his body to disintegrate, leaving only his left arm behind.<ref name=\"The Phantom Limb\" />\n\nAfter Dameron arrived and rescued C-3PO, Omri's left arm was used to replace Threepio's missing arm. Threepio told Dameron's astromech [[BB-8]] that while his new arm offended his aesthetic sensibilities, he would keep it for a while to remember his fallen friends.<ref name=\"The Phantom Limb\" /> Sometime after receiving his new arm, he also received an update to his [[TranLang III communication module]], allowing fluency in over seven millions forms of communication, one million more than previously.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\n====Operation: Sabre Strike====\nFollowing the successful [[Operation: Sabre Strike]], C-3PO accompanied General Organa when she went to greet Poe Dameron and his fellow pilots [[Iolo Arana]] and [[Kar\u00e9 Kun]]. C-3PO complied with Organa's orders to examine the flight computers aboard the ''[[Hevurion Grace]]'', the captured luxury yacht of the New Republic Senator [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]]. While examining the computers, C-3PO confirmed General Organa's lingering suspicions that Senator Ro-Kiintor had indeed been secretly colluding with the First Order. In addition, the protocol droid found information relevant to Leia's quest to find her missing brother, Luke Skywalker. Using this information, General Organa sent Poe Dameron on a mission to find [[Lor San Tekka]].<ref name=\"BFA\">''[[Before the Awakening]]''</ref>\n\n====Aftermath of Ovanis====\nAfter the First Order learned about [[Black Squadron (First Order)|Black Squadron's]] [[Mission to Ovanis|secret mission]] to [[Ovanis]], General Leia tasked C-3PO and his spy network with ferreting out the [[spy]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\">[[Poe Dameron 4|''Poe Dameron'' 4]]</ref>\n\n====Mission to Kaddak====\n{{Quote|I am indeed flattered, sir, as I am a mere protocol droid, and&mdash;''\"<br />\"''Shut up.

Since they had lost contact with the droid, C-3PO visited Poe Dameron to request the Resistance starfighter pilot's help in traveling to Kaddak and retrieving the data. Under Organa's orders, C-3PO instructed Poe to bring himself and another pilot in a shuttle to avoid attracting attention. Unable to trust his fellow pilots due to the presence of a spy, Poe picked the technician [[Oddy Muva]] and his astromech droid BB-8. C-3PO and the team departed in a freighter.<ref name=\"PD8\">[[Poe Dameron 8|''Poe Dameron'' 8]]</ref>\n\nUpon landing on Kaddak, C-3PO and the others witnessed a man being thrown to his death. While visiting a [[cantina]] on [[Level 45]] of [[the Sliver]], C-3PO commented about the presence of criminal factions and wished that his old friend Han Solo were here. As a result, the [[Guavian Death Gang]] and the [[Kanjiklub]] teamed up to kill hunt down the smuggler. C-3PO also encountered a [[MSE-6 series repair droid|mouse droid]] who informed him that their spy droid had been captured by the [[Ranc gang]]. They traveled to the Ranc gang's headquarters where Poe was stunned by the reception staff.<ref name=\"PD9\">[[Poe Dameron 9|''Poe Dameron'' 9]]</ref>\n\nC-3PO, Oddy, and BB-8 were surrounded by several gangsters, who wanted to take Poe and destroy them. C-3PO outmaneuvered the gangsters by activating several droid spies, who forced the gang to stand down. The droids also rescued N1-ZX. Despite C-3PO's orders, N1-ZX refused to release the information he was carrying until he was safely returned to the Resistance base due to his embedded self-preservation programming. Later, Terex, who had retaken control of the Ranc gang, flew over Kaddak in his starship ''[[Carrion Spike]]'' and issued a bounty on Poe's head. With the help of BB-8, Poe activated several Resistance droid spies, who proceeded to block the mob. Despite Oddy Muva's disappearance, the group fled aboard Poe's [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]] ''[[Black One]]''. C-3PO and N1-ZX hid in consoles that were built into the fighter's [[S-foils]].<ref name=\"PD10\" />\n\nAfter fleeing into space, Poe asked C-3PO if he had any luck contacting Oddy Muva. C-3PO apologized that he had not. Poe decided to get N1-ZX back to the Resistance base. C-3PO remarked that he regarded traveling through hyperspace while attached to a starship as a nightmarish experience. Regarding Kaddak as \"bad news,\" C-3PO opined that he hoped that Master Muva was not in any sort of danger. In fact, Oddy Muva had stowed aboard Terex's ship ''Carrion Spike''<ref name=\"PD11\">[[Poe Dameron 11|''Poe Dameron'' 11]]</ref> with the intent of rescuing his wife, [[Sowa Chuan]]. Terex had blackmailed Muva into spying on the Resistance using his wife as a hostage.<ref name=\"PD12\">[[Poe Dameron 12|''Poe Dameron'' 12]]</ref>\n\n[[File:PoeDameron12.jpg|300x330px|thumb|right|C-3PO and Poe Dameron were pursued by the Ranc gang.]]\nDuring the hyperspace journey, Poe confided in C-3PO his suspicions that there was a spy among their ranks. Poe ruled out General Organa and his Black Squadron mates. C-3PO vouched for General Organa and reassured Poe that she was not a traitor. Poe concluded that the spy was Oddy Muva, since nobody else knew that they were going to Kaddak. Poe decided that they could not risk bringing Nunzix back to [[D'Qar]] and told C-3PO to wake him up. C-3PO complied, and Poe questioned N1-ZX about the data he was carrying. After exiting hyperspace, they were pursued by Terex's ship ''Carrion Spike'' and his fleet of Ranc \"[[Ugly|Uglies]].\" Poe's X-wing was hit and crash-landed on a [[Unidentified desert planet|desert planet]].<ref name=\"PD11\" />\n\nC-3PO and the others survived the crash, but Nunzix's right arm was severed. The droids and Poe fled into a cave to escape Terex's \"Uglies.\" Terex soon led a landing party into the cave. BB-8 tried to delay the Ranc gang by crashing a stalactite on top of the intruders. After BB-8 was shot down, C-3PO volunteered to stay behind in order to slow down the Ranc gang so that Poe and N1-ZX could retreat. He reassured Poe that he was expendable and could be rebuilt. When Terex and his gang arrived, C-3PO used his knowledge of languages to summon the [[fjor-bat]]s in the cave to harry the pirates, claiming they had come to steal their [[youngling]]s. Terex retaliated by shaking C-3PO's right leg off. Having found his equivalent spymaster, Terex stole C-3PO's memory unit, disabling the droid.<ref name=\"PD12\" />\n\nIn C-3PO's absence, Black Squadron arrived to rescue Poe and [[Battle over a desert planet|fought]] Terex's criminal fleet in space. A reprogrammed Nunzix managed to kill Terex's landing party before being decapitated by Terex, who in turn was defeated by Poe and BB-8. Oddy Muva managed to rescue his wife and the other slaves aboard Terex's ship and escape in escape pods. First Order forces under [[Commander]] [[Malarus]] subsequently arrived and destroyed Terex's fleet. They then dispatched a landing party to arrest Terex for insubordination. Poe dragged the inactive C-3PO and the defeated Terex out of the cave. Poe allowed Malarus to arrest Terex.<ref name=\"PD13\">[[Poe Dameron 13|''Poe Dameron'' 13]]</ref>\n\n====Tracking BB-8====\n[[File:Threepio-R2-TFA.jpg|thumb|left|300px|C-3PO with R2-D2 and BB-8 shortly after R2's awakening]]\nShortly before the [[Battle of Starkiller Base]], C-3PO had neglected to turn on BB-8's tracking device before the droid went on a vital mission to [[Jakku]] with Poe Dameron. When the droid went missing, Threepio alerted the droid spynet to keep an eye out for BB-8.<ref name=\"TFAVD\" />\n\nWhen BB-8 was found on [[Takodana]] with Han Solo and [[Finn]], C-3PO was part of the Resistance team that arrived to pick them up. As Han Solo was reunited with Leia, C-3PO interrupted them before they had the chance to speak to each other, eagerly introducing himself, stating that Solo must not recognize him because of the red arm. Not realizing they had already seen each other, Threepio went to re-introduce Leia, before noticing he had ruined the moment. Threepio then decided it was best to leave them to talk to each other, walking off with BB-8, who asked him if he must get his proper arm reinstalled, and he replied \"Yes.\"<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens\">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>\n\n[[File:Resistance_group_shot.png|thumb|right|300px|The Resistance looks after the ''Falcon''.]]\nAfter returning to Resistance Base on D'Qar, C-3PO found BB-8 observing R2-D2, who had been in self-imposed low power mode ever since Luke went into hiding. Threepio told him it was no use trying to wake him up, and it was very unlikely he would have the rest of the map to find Luke Skywalker stored in his backup data. Shortly after the Battle of Starkiller Base, R2-D2 awoke from his low-power mode, discovering he indeed had the map to Skywalker, to Threepio and BB-8's excitement and shock. Before [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] left to travel to the system they had found Luke Skywalker on, Threepio had replaced his left arm, and now once again sported golden plating.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens\" />\n\n====Evacuation of D'Qar====\n{{Quote|Wipe that nervous expression off your face, Threepio.''\"<br />\"''Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General.

However, as they resumed their activities, C-3PO received a transmission, which depicted the [[First Order Navy]] regrouping, causing him to urgently contact Organa and inform her to go to the command center as soon as she could. When asked by Organa how much time they had before the First Order's arrival, Threepio answered that it was very little and that they would be there before they knew it. Realizing that the base was unshielded and that if the First Order brought enough firepower the base would be destroyed, Organa ordered the Resistance's [[Battle of D'Qar|evacuation]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 28\">[[Poe Dameron 28|''Poe Dameron'' 28]]</ref> During the evacuation, Threepio was on the bridge of the [[flagship]], [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']].<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>\n\n====Attack on the Resistance fleet====\n{{Quote|Sir, I am almost afraid to ask&mdash;''\"<br />\"''Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.|C-3PO, to Poe Dameron|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}\nAfter escaping the First Order at D'Qar, the Resistance was [[Battle of Oetchi|ambushed]] by the First Order command ship, ''[[Supremacy]]'', as well as several [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers]]. During this time, Threepio was still on the ''Raddus'', but not on the bridge.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\" />\n\nThreepio was present on the secondary bridge when Vice-Admiral [[Amilyn Holdo]] was named the new commander of the fleet, expressing concern when informed that all Resistance senior leadership on the bridge save Leia had perished in the attack. Threepio spent time watching over Leia as she recovered from her injuries. Threepio and was present in the medical bay when Poe sent Finn and [[Rose Tico]] on a [[Mission to Canto Bight|secret mission]] to the casino at [[Canto Bight]]. Threepio warned Dameron that Holdo would never authorize their plan.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\" />\n\nThreepio remained aboard the ''Raddus'' and became an unwilling participant in Poe's mutiny against Holdo. Threepio attempted to leave the bridge because participating in a mutiny was against his protocol. Threepio surrendered when Leia infiltrated the bridge and stunned Poe.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\" />\n\n====Escaping the First Order====\n[[File:C-3PO-Crait.png|270px|thumb|left|C-3PO on the salt planet of Crait]]\nPer Holdo's plan to allow the Resistance to survive, Threepio boarded a cloaked [[U-55 orbital loadlifter]] bound for the planet [[Crait]] along with the other surviving Resistance fighters. The Resistance planned to use an [[Crait outpost|abandoned Rebel hideout]] on the planet to send a signal for help to the Outer Rim. Owing to Holdo's sacrifice, Threepio's transport was one of the six that survived the First Order's attack and reached the planet's surface safely.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\" />\n\nOn Crait, Threepio interpreted BB-8's analysis of the mine's schematics, determining that the massive bunker door was the only way in or out of the base. After the Resistance's [[Battle of Crait|attack run]] on the First Order's [[Superlaser siege cannon|siege cannon]] failed and the bunker door was breached, Threepio witnessed a [[Force projection|projection]] of Luke Skywalker emerge from the shadows of the base. A shocked Threepio was only able to say the legendary Jedi's name, and Luke winked at him in response.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\" />\n\nShortly after, Threepio realized that his audio sensors could no longer detect the [[Vulptex|vulptices]], and along with the rest of the Resistance, he followed Poe to an unmapped natural opening, blocked by boulders, that the wildlife of Crait used to access the base. Threepio looked on as Rey used the Force to move the boulders out of the way, allowing the Resistance to escape on board the ''Falcon'', where Threepio was reunited with R2-D2.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\" />\n\n===Aboard the ''Falcon''===\nFollowing the Battle of Crait and having escaped from the First Order aboard the ''Falcon'', C-3PO found R2-D2 and BB-8 talking in a hallway. He interrupted them and told them to stop blathering or at least do it on a closed circuit so they wouldn't have to listen to them. He commented about the heavy losses of the Battle of Starkiller Base and told the two droids he was involved in a very important project and they were making it extremely difficult for him to concentrate. As the two droids departed, C-3PO told Rey, who was reading one of the Jedi Order's [[Sacred Jedi texts|sacred texts]], that he had dealt with the droids and they wouldn't bother them any further before asking her where they had gone.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 28\" />\n\nRey asked C-3PO to translate a paragraph in one of the [[book]]s. Finding the translation initially a bit difficult due to the fact the language used was unusual, Threepio took the book and translated the text, leading Rey to comment that she liked the passage and that it was a lovely place to begin. Later, upon receiving a transmission from Black Squadron from one of their [[Relay station/Canon|relay stations]], C-3PO went to report the transmission to Dameron and Finn, to which Dameron explained to Finn that they just needed to have a little faith. However, due to Dameron's excitement over the news, C-3PO reported that Dameron needed to listen to the message as he wouldn't call it good news.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 28\" />\n\n===Time on Anoat===\nThreepio was present at the [[Resistance Camp]] on the garbage planet of [[Anoat]] when Leia Organa decided to [[Mission to Mon Cala|go]] and seek aid from the inhabitants of [[Mon Cala]].<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref>\n\n===Defeating the First Order===\n{{Quote|If this mission fails, it was all for nothing.

After learning of the return of Emperor Palpatine and that he was based on the planet [[Exegol]], which R2 and him stated was not on any star map, C-3PO travelled with Rey, Finn, Chewbacca, and Poe Dameron to [[Pasaana]] on their mission to find a [[Sith wayfinder]], where they encountered C-3PO and Chewbacca's old friend Lando Calrissian. During his time on Passanna the group recovered a Sith dagger. While C-3PO was able to translate the writings on the Sith dagger, his programming prevented him from being able to reveal the translation to anyone.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\" />\n\nThe group travelled to [[Kijimi]], where the droidsmith [[Babu Frik]] was able to determine how to bypass C-3PO's programming restrictions, but said doing so would cause C-3PO to undergo a complete [[memory wipe]]. C-3PO willingly allowed Frik to perform the procedure, believing that this would result in the permanent loss of his memories as he didn't think R2-D2 had a backup of his memory. C-3PO's [[photoreceptor]]s turned red while he translated the Sith writings on the dagger. After completing the translation C-3PO rebooted, and his memory was wiped in the process, leaving him to restart with his basic factory programming.<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\" />\n\nUpon the group's return to Ajan Kloss, it turned out that R2-D2 had backed up C-3PO's memories to the point where Rey had undertaken her first mission for the Resistance. R2-D2 was able to restore his counterpart's memories from that backup. During the [[Battle of Exegol]], the Resistance, joined by the [[Citizens' Fleet]] gathered by Calrissian and Chewbacca, defeated the [[Final Order]] fleet and inspired a galactic [[uprising against the First Order]]. When the Resistance and civilian fleet gathered at Ajan Kloss, C-3PO was with R2 when Rey landed aboard [[Red Five (X-wing starfighter)|Red Five]]. When he heard the X-wing's approach, he asked R2 if he heard the same, the very same question<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\" /> he had asked his astromech droid friend decades earlier above Tatooine.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Quote|It's all right, sir.

As a droid, he exhibited much loyalty and commitment to his masters and sought to serve them to his best ability. Throughout his operational life, C-3PO worked diligently for several masters including Anakin Skywalker,<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" /> Padm\u00e9 Amidala,<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" /> Bail Organa,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith\" /> and Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\" /> As a protocol droid, C-3PO could communicate in over seven million different forms of communication.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> This allowed him to communicate with computer systems including those on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\" />\n\n[[File:C-3PO_SoH.png|thumb|right|200px|C-3PO was a loyal servant and friend]]\nUnlike his astromech counterpart, R2-D2, C-3PO liked to stick to routine and did not respond well to change. When placed in danger, C-3PO had a tendency to panic as shown on several occasions, including infiltrating a droid foundry on [[Geonosis]]<ref name=\"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\" /> and a [[Mission to steal Imperial weapons|mission]] to steal Imperial disruptors on [[Lothal]].<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" /> Despite his loyalty and commitment, C-3PO was generally unable to lie or to keep secrets due to his programming.
