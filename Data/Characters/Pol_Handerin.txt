You must be the one Lt. Jasper was saying would come to help me. Boy, I sure hope you're able to.

After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], the farmer got into serious trouble because of wild creatures and bandits that plagued his farm. Handerin thus went to seek help from the [[Corellian Security Force]].<ref name=\"SWG:HFPH\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> CorSec [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mack Jasper]] dispatched a recruit to help the farmer. Pol Handerin first tasked the CorSec agent to hunt and eliminate a pack of enraged [[carrion spat]]s that did a lot of damage. The CorSec agent succeed and even killed the pack leader [[Gravefeather]]. Handerin then asked the CorSec agent to deal with a group of criminals, the [[Nedgarr Bandits]], who damaged crops and stole grain. The mission was once again successful. The CorSec agent managed to recover the stolen grain and eliminate several bandits, including their leader [[Trae Nedgarr]], during an assault on the [[Nedgarr Bandits Hideout]]. Handerin was really thankful for the help he received and that solved all his problems. When the CorSec agent mentioned his will to work for the government, Pol Handerin eagerly proposed to introduce the CorSec agent to his cousin, [[Gallura Handerin]], a government aide in the [[Coronet Capitol]].<ref name=\"SWG:HFPH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPol Handerin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:HFPH\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nPol Handerin was added to the game with the expansion ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan]]'', released on [[November 1]], [[2005]].
