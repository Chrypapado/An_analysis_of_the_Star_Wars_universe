In [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]] the journalist asked a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] on the streets of [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]] to visit the [[Imperial Stronghold]] on Corellia. She couldn't visit the base herself, as the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] was aware of her activities and didn't allow her to get near the stronghold. She uploaded the stronghold's coordinates to the spacer's [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]], hoping that she could use the adventurer's observations in future news stories.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe excited journalist is a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment's]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. She is one of many herald NPCs that were added to the game shortly after its launch to point players to dungeons and other points of interest. When a player talks to her and agrees to help, a [[:w:c:swg:Waypoint|waypoint]] is added to the player's datapad. When the player talks to her again, the same dialogue starts from the beginning.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Journalists]]\n[[Category:Unidentified females]]"}}}]}}}}
