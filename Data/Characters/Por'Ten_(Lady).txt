She had a narrow face, [[Tattoo/Legends|tattooed]] lips, and blue-veined hands.\n\n==Biography==\nThe Families of Cestus Cybernetics aspired to overthrow the Regent [[G'Mai Duris]] from the government. The [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and the [[Vippit]] [[Doolb Snoil]] managed to make the Regent give up trusting the Families. Then, [[Caiza Quill]], [[Por'Ten (Lord)|Lord]] and Lady Por'Ten, and [[Debbikin the Young]] caught the magcar to move through the subterranean tunnels.\n\nDuring the journey, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]] pretended to be one of [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku's]] envoys, Nemonus, and he held back the four leaders to make a negotiation. Then, they were liberated by Kenobi, who arrived just on time. These fact made [[Ord Cestus/Legends|Ord Cestus]] change its position in favor of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. But Quill received a hologram where was revealed the Jedi sham. So, Regent Duris had to depend on the Cestus Cybernetics again.\n\nThen, the [[Five Families]], allied with [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]], used the [[JK-13 security droid]]s against the [[Desert Wind]]. When the conflict was acquiring importance the [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] decided to send the cruiser [[Nexu (starship)|''Nexu'']]. When the ship achieved the orbit of Ord Cestus, the Five Families, including Lord and Lady Por'Ten, took refuge in a secret bunker, that finally was discovered by [[Advanced Recon Commando/Legends|ARC trooper]] [[Alpha-98|Jangotat]]. Jangotat went on search of the leaders of Cestus Cybernetics but got trapped next to the bunker. He eventually sent a code ordering the Nexu to bomb over him killing everyone in the vicinity.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Cestus Deception]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Por'Ten (Lady)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Cestians]]\n[[Category:Confederacy of Independent Systems individuals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
