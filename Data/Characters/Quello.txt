Yeah. I guess you're right. ...and by right, I mean you're WRONG! Telling me that it'll be 'fine' where it is, what, you think I'm stupid?|Quello to [[Meetra Surik]] after the latter attempted a Mind Trick|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Quello''' was a pale-skinned [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]] [[Refugee Landing Pad|landing pad]] owner who was met by the [[Meetra Surik]] after the landing of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' in the [[Refugee Sector]] on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Quello protested that the landing pad was reserved for other clients, but Surik promised to pay him for his troubles. Soon enough, the crew of the ''[[Red Eclipse]]'' arrived and attempted to take the crew of the ''Ebon Hawk'' hostage after confronting Quello, but were fended off by Surik.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWithin the game, if the player possesses the [[Mind trick/Legends|Affect Mind]] or Dominate Mind [[The Force/Legends|Force]] power, they can attempt to Force Persuade Quello into letting them stay. Quello fakes like he has been persuaded, only to continue his protest. This is because Toydarians (such as [[Watto/Legends|Watto]] from [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']]) are not affected by [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] mind tricks. However, a sufficiently high Wisdom score coupled with the highest Force Persuasion powers ''can'' allow the player to succeed in tricking Quello.\n\nQuello was voiced by [[Andrew Secombe]] who also voiced [[Watto/Legends|Watto]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Quello\n|hu=Quello\n|pl=Quello\n}}\n\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Toydarians]]"}}}]}}}}
