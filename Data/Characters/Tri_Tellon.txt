[[Reproduction|Born]] on the [[ecumenopolis]] of [[Coruscant]], she had worked the [[CoCo Town]] area since she was a [[Youngling|hatchling]]. At some point, she partnered with an old rogue called [[Magreda]]. Over the course of her thieving career, Tellon stole many things from the clientele of [[Dexter Jettster]]'s [[Dex's Diner|diner]].<ref name=\"Stop, Thief\" />\n\nOne [[Standard day|day]], she managed to steal an unidentified item from the [[Jedi]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who was enjoying a drink at Dex's. Since she knew every nook and cranny of CoCoTown, she managed to outrun the pursuing Jedi and diner owner. Arrived at the den she shared with Magreda, the Pa'lowick proudly showed her partner the item stolen from Kenobi, which she assumed had mystical powers and was worth of fortune. When \"Magreda\" turned to face her, she realized that it was in fact the Jedi in disguise. On the other side of the room, Dexter Jettster held the door, blocking her only exit. While being taken away, Tellon learned that the so-called artifact was in fact a worthless [[Paperweight/Canon|paperweight]] bugged with a [[Homing beacon|tracking device]], and that she had been played all along.<ref name=\"Stop, Thief\" />\n\nDecades after those events, the [[Wild Space]] [[cartographer]] and adventurer [[Emil Graf]] recounted the story of Tellon's arrest to his [[BB-series astromech droid|BB-series]] [[Astromech droid|astromech]] [[BB-00]].<ref name=\"Stop, Thief\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=1|story=[[Tales from Wild Space: Stop, Thief!]]}} {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=32|story=[[The Lost Stories, Part 3]]}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Tri Tellon\n|ja=\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30fb\u30c6\u30ed\u30f3\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tellon, Tri}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pa'lowicks]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
