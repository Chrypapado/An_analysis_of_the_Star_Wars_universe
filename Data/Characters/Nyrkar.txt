He was in charge of food preparation and dietary consultation, and was considered by his employer, [[Cal Majjer]], to be the Emporium's most valuable employee. Majjer referred to Nyrkar as \"his Wookiee,\" although there was no relationship of life debt or indentured servitude between them. Nyrkar was amongst those residents of [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] who disappeared themselves to join the [[Cularin resistance]], much to Majjer's dismay.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Nyrkar\n}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
