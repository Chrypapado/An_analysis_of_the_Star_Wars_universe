She was secretly being preyed upon by [[Ziakas]], a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Derriphan (creature)|creature]] that was devouring her very essence.\n\n==Biography==\nKandria and her [[Twin/Legends|twin]] sister [[Corinna A'Daasha|Corinna]] were born into a wealthy family that provided for all their needs. As children they never struggled for anything and although her sister Corinna became bored and restless by a life of luxury, Kandria enjoyed her childhood using her economic freedom to fund lessons in dancing, singing, and musical instruments. When Corinna left home to explore the galaxy, separation did not suit either sister and shortly afterwards Kandria joined her sister in their journey through the stars.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\nIt was Kandria's idea to travel to the pleasure planet of [[Adarlon/Legends|Adarlon]] and finally the twins found a site that suited both of their personalities. Although it was both their ideas to open up the nightclub, the [[Glow Dome]], the day-to-day operations have fallen almost entirely on Corinna as Kandria spent her time entertaining and partying.\nA dangerous [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] creature, a [[Derriphan (creature)|Derriphan]] known as [[Ziakas]], attached itself to Kandria and had begun feeding upon her thoughts and essence. Kandria attributed the fatigue as caused by too little sleep and too much partying but the truth was much more horrific. If left to feed upon Karinna the Derriphan would have drained her to an empty husk in less than a month.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKandria was far more wild and free spirited than her sister, in fact the two were almost opposites. This would explain why she felt no particular pull towards the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] unlike her sister. Both sisters had a mischievous streak but while Corinna's antics were harmless, Kandria would often get herself into bad situations that resulted in her more practical sister coming to her rescue. Kandria could also be cruel and had a tendency to go through boyfriends very quickly. Kandria was a very attractive woman and wore form-fitting and revealing outfits to accentuate her body. She wore her long, curly blonde hair in elegantly styled hairdos, and she always made sure to keep up with the latest fashions.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nAlthough she had talent as a holoprogrammer, Kandria was only a moderately skilled artist and dancer despite being passionate about entertaining. She was a skilled seductress and could be very persuasive when she wanted to. She was fairly skilled with [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] as well.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n===Equipment===\nKandria carried two [[Model Q4 hold-out blaster pistol|Quickfire-4]] [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blasters]]. She often wore a form-fitting [[Jumpsuit/Legends|jumpsuit]] that was cut to be even more revealing than her sister's. Over this she would wear an azure cloak that was the exact same shade as her eyes.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKandria A'Daasha was designed by [[Paul Danner]] and [[Bill Smith]] for ''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'', a supplement for the ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' that was published by [[West End Games]] in [[1997]]. She was illustrated by [[Tom O'Neill]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:A'Daasha, Kandria}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
