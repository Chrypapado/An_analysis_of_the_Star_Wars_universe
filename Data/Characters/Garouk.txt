But that was before I retired from the gambling life.|Garouk|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Garouk''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who traveled [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] as a professional [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]] in his younger [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. He eventually retired, choosing to spend his [[Time/Legends|time]] in [[Taris/Legends|Taris's]] [[Upper City Cantina]], where he would teach individuals the rules of [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] for a small [[Galactic Credit Standard|fee]]. In [[3956 BBY]], he sold a pazaak deck to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I've traveled the span of the galaxy, from the Core Worlds to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim. I've won countless fortunes&hellip; and lost countless more.|Garouk, reminiscing about his youth|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nGarouk was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] considered elderly by the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Jedi Civil War]]. In his youth, he was among the best professional [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] players in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. Garouk traveled to [[Planet/Legends|planets]] all over [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], both winning and losing fortunes, until old age began to degrade his mind's sharpness. Realizing this, he retired from [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] and instead became a patron of the [[Upper City Cantina]] on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. There, he spent his days drinking [[Ale/Legends|ale]] and talking to patrons,<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> as well as teaching others how to play pazaak.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> When the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] [[Destruction of Taris|invaded]] Taris, Garouk was mostly ignored because of his age.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIn [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"CG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> Garouk met [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Carth Onasi]] in the Upper City [[Cantina/Legends|Cantina]]. Garouk told them about his career as a gambler and about life on Taris. Unwilling to let his pazaak decks go to waste, he sold one, consisting of a main deck and a ten-card side deck&mdash;two copies of each card from +1 to +5&mdash;to them for fifty [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. He also uploaded the rules of the game to Revan's [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] and gave him free lessons.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|The Upper City is nice enough, though it was better before the Sith showed up.|Garouk|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nGarouk believed that pazaak was a young man's game. He spent his time in the Upper City, preferring to avoid the dangerous [[Lower City|lower levels]] of Taris. Although he disliked the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] presence, he found life on the planet acceptable and cared little about events outside the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Glad to see you're interested in the grand old game.|Garouk, if the player agrees to buy his deck|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nGarouk's first [[canon]]ical appearance was as a non-player character in the [[2003]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' [[video game]], in which the player, Revan, can interact with him. Garouk serves as an introduction to the pazaak mini-game. Buying the deck from Garouk initiates the side quest \"Pazaak Rules,\" which can be completed by winning any pazaak game with a wager. Throughout the conversation between Revan and Garouk, the player has several dialogue options to choose from. However, the nature of the conversation is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment. Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with Garouk at all.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Garouk\n|es=Garouk\n|pl=Garouk\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u0440\u0443\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
