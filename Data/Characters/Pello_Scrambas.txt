Scrambas's father was [[Tash Scrambas]], the [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the ''[[Qel-Droma]]'', who served [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Jorus C'baoth]] during the [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention]]. On the last day of the Contention, the younger Scrambas joined the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] armed forces. Rising to the rank of [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]], his peers believed that [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] would be insulated from the [[The galaxy/Legends|pan-galactic]] [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], but Scrambas knew better. He saw combat frequently in the conflict, as [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] made his move toward the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]]. After serving in several tours of duty, Scrambas was transferred to [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa's]] personal guard.\n\nDespite his new role as a guard, Scrambas still saw plenty of action during the remainder of the war, on [[Planet/Legends|planets]] as diverse as [[Boz Pity/Legends|Boz Pity]], [[Qalydon/Legends|Qalydon]], and [[Metalorn/Legends|Metalorn]]. When the war came to a close in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Scrambas stayed on with Organa, having formed a close and personal friendship with the senator. Nearly twenty years later, Scrambas came to serve Organa's daughter, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who had succeeded her father in the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]] and had ties to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. It was those ties that attracted the attention of [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], whose [[501st Legion/Legends|forces]] [[Battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|boarded]] the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. During the boarding, Scrambas was wounded and captured by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], and was killed shortly afterward, sacrificing himself for the daughter of his trusted friend.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career and the Clone Wars===\nPello Scrambas was [[Reproduction/Legends|sired]] by [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Tash Scrambas]] of the ''[[Qel-Droma]]''<ref name=\"db\" /> in either [[47 BBY/Legends|47]] or [[43 BBY/Legends|43 BBY]],<ref name=\"Birth\" /> during the [[Republic Classic era]]. The elder Scrambas took part in the [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention]], the conflict over what [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] noble house would assume the [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroyship]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], serving [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] moderator [[Jorus C'baoth]] during the crisis, as he did not wish to side with the [[House of Organa/Legends|House of Organa]] or the [[House of Antilles]]. On the day that C'baoth ended the contention, Pello Scrambas joined Alderaan's armed forces, aged fifteen. By [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Scrambas held the rank of [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]], and when the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] broke out, he was told to expect \"limited action\" in the coming conflict, as it was thought that the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] would be able to adequately suppress the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nFrom the perspective of those in the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], the conflict was seen as a \"brush war,\" and one that the Core would be insulated from. Scrambas was not satisfied with the assessment, however, and he was vindicated in his thinking when the Clone Wars spread across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Alderaan itself was threatened by the Confederate advance many times,<ref name=\"db\" /> and during [[Operation Durge's Lance]], the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Duro/Legends|Duro]] [[Battle of Duro (Clone Wars)|fell]] to the Confederate [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]],<ref name=\"shadowfeed\">''[[CIS Shadowfeed Dispatch 15:2:29 Edition]]''</ref> making Scrambas's [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] particularly vulnerable. He found himself constantly fighting on the front lines against the Confederacy, and after several tours of duty, he was transferred to the personal guard of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Prestor Organa]].<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===The Organas===\nDespite the fact that he was now guarding a senator, Scrambas still found himself actively fighting the Confederacy. Organa participated in the war frequently,<ref name=\"db\" /> witnessing the battles in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], particularly [[Battle of Boz Pity (Clone Wars)|Boz Pity]],<ref name=\"obs\">''[[Star Wars: Obsession]]''</ref> [[Mission to Metalorn (Bail Organa)|rescuing]] waylaid [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] such as [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]] on [[Metalorn/Legends|Metalorn]],<ref name=\"bo\">''[[Bailed Out]]''</ref> and visiting fronts such as [[Qalydon/Legends|Qalydon]]. During those particular adventures and conflicts, Scrambas and Organa became close friends.<ref name=\"db\" /> In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], the war came to a close with the [[Death/Legends|deaths]] of General Grievous, Confederate leader [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], and the [[Separatist Council]]. In the wake of the war's conclusion, former-[[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] replaced the Republic with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"rots\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\nAfter many years of service, Organa was succeeded as senator by his daughter, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]],<ref name=\"anhn\">[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'']]</ref> and Scrambas, now a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]], came to regard the young woman as he would his own daughter.<ref name=\"db\" /> In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], approximately twenty years after first serving Bail Organa directly, Scrambas was aboard the princess's [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] when she received a transmission from [[Spy/Legends|spies]] belonging to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] containing [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] to the Empire's new [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[battlestation]]. However, Organa's [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] was pursued from [[Toprawa/Legends|Toprawa]] to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']], and was eventually disabled over the latter world.<ref name=\"raf\">''[[The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader]]''</ref> Scrambas volunteered to lead a detachment to repel potential boarders,<ref name=\"ff\">{{FFCite|69}}</ref> so he and his fellow guards were deployed to fight the Imperial teams that stormed the ship. He was hit by [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] fire,<ref name=\"anh\" /> and was captured as the first wave of Vader's [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] [[Battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|barged]] onto the craft.<ref name=\"swe\">''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> Shortly thereafter, he was gunned down, succumbing to a blaster wound.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAs a young man, Pello Scrambas was perceptive enough to realize that the Clone Wars were going to be far more than just the local brush fire that his superiors predicted. He gained a considerable amount of combat experience during the war&mdash;so much so that in his later life his exploits were almost legend amongst those under his command. Scrambas himself jokingly entertained the rumors, even going so far as to enhance them.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Pello Scrambas first appeared in [[George Lucas]]' [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], as an unnamed extra in the opening scenes, played by [[Eddie Eddon]].<ref name=\"Aficionado\">{{Blogspot|blogspoturl=starwarsaficionado|url=2013/02/aficionado-classic-behind-scenes-info_16.html|blogspotname=Star Wars Aficionado Magazine|postname=AFICIONADO CLASSIC BEHIND THE SCENES INFO PART FOUR|archivedate=20160818210731}}</ref> His scenes were filmed in mid [[1976]] in the [[Wikipedia:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"TMOSW\">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref> In [[1996]], he was identified in the \"[[A New Hope Limited]]\" set of the [[Star Wars Customizable Card Game|''Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game]], on the card entitled \"Rebel Squad Leader.\" Scrambas's story was fleshed out by [[Aidan Hennessy]] (writing as \"Darth NTM\") through [[StarWars.com]]'s [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature, \"[[What's The Story?]]\" Hennessy's winning entry, published in the [[Databank (original)|Databank]], made connections to a wide variety of disparate [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] elements, such as the alluded-to Alderaan Ascendancy Contention from [[1992]]'s ''[[Dark Force Rising]]'', the fall of Duro from [[2004]]'s ''[[CIS Shadowfeed Dispatch 15:2:29 Edition]]'', and Bail Organa's mission to Metalorn from [[2006]]'s ''[[Bailed Out]]''.\n\nFor chronicling the early stages of the Clone Wars, Hennessy drew inspiration from the attitudes people had toward [[Wikipedia:World War I|World War I]]. By his own admission, Hennessy also, inadvertently, misspelled \"Scrambas\" as \"Scambras\" several times in his entry.<ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|QuentinGeorge|3|Pello Scrambas&hellip;uh&hellip;.Scambras&hellip;.whatever - Behind the Scenes|Do Nautolans Dream of Aquatic Sheep?|Aidan Hennessy|archivedate=20070912024507}}</ref> Hennessy's entry also conflicted with an earlier source, the [[1998]] ''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', which claimed that Scrambas was captured when the Imperial forces attacked the ''Tantive IV'', and was never seen again. Despite this, the Databank does not explicitly state that Scrambas perished during the sortie seen at the start of ''A New Hope''. Scrambas was also featured and identified in StarWars.com's short-lived [[Visual Guides]] feature. The character was shown in \"Chapter 3\" of the feature.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Light/large/rebelsquadleader.gif|cardname=Rebel Squad Leader}} {{1stID}}\n*{{InsiderCite|32|20 Years Ago Today: An Anniversary Toast to Star Wars}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{FFCite|69}} {{C|TAN 4-5, ''Crisis on the'' Tantive IV}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/explore/visualguides/chp03_picview/pictureviewer.html?imgNum=24&world=episode-iv|text=Visual Guide &mdash; Chapter 3: Imperial Boarding Party, Image 24|archivedate=20070920153711}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/explore/visualguides/chp03_picview/pictureviewer.html?imgNum=25&world=episode-iv|text=Visual Guide &mdash; Chapter 3: Imperial Boarding Party, Image 25|archivedate=20070921092939}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|pelloscambras|Scrambas, Pello|archivedate=20100918105632}}\n*{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope|text=''Star Wars: A New Hope''}} {{Video}}\n*{{SWE|groups|stormtroopers|Stormtroopers}} {{Video}}\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-guide-to-warfare-authors-cut-part-12-tales-of-the-new-republic|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'' Author's Cut, Part 12: Tales Of The New Republic|int=Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Blog|QuentinGeorge|3|Pello Scrambas&hellip;uh&hellip;.Scambras&hellip;.whatever - Behind the Scenes|Do Nautolans Dream of Aquatic Sheep?|Aidan Hennessy|archivedate=20070912024507}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|da=Pello Scrambas\n|de=Pello Scrambas\n|nl=Pello Scrambas\n|ja=\u30da\u30ed\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d0\u30b9\n|ru=\u041f\u0435\u043b\u043b\u043e \u0421\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0430\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scrambas, Pello}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance Fleet officers]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
