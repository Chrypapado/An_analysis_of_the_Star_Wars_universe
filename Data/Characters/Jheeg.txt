He worked as a paid contact for [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]], keeping tabs on the criminal underworld and, when necessary, supplying Intelligence agents with false identities. His security clearance within the organization, however, was very low.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], Jheeg provided an [[Imperial Agent]], later known as [[Cipher Nine]], a cover identity as the pirate, the [[Red Blade]], to infiltrate [[Suudaa Nem'ro|Nem'ro]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] organization. However, as soon as Nine's mission was complete, Jheeg informed the agent that the real Red Blade was on Hutta searching for his impostor, and advised haste in intercepting Blade.\n\nThe [[Minister of Intelligence (Galactic War)|former Minister of Intelligence]] would later use Jheeg's name as a cover when contacting [[Cipher Nine]] on the planet [[Rishi/Legends|Rishi]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jheeg#legends\n}}\n\n[[Category:Arcona]]\n[[Category:Imperial Intelligence personnel of the resurgent Sith Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
