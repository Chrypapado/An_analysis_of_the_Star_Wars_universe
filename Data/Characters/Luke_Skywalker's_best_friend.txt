He was Force-sensitive, though was not as strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] as Luke Skywalker was.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n\"Luke Skywalker's best friend\" is the protagonist of the ''[[Choose Your Own Star Wars Adventure]]'' trilogy by [[Christopher Golden]]. Because these novels are written in the second-person point of view similar to the [[Wikipedia:Choose Your Own Adventure|Choose Your Own Adventure]] series, the reader assumes the role of the protagonist. Within the context of the story, the reader is first identified by the phrase \"You are [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] Best Friend\" and is identified subsequently by various epithets in order to maintain ambiguity. The process of making choices preserves the illusion that the reader is actively taking part in and influencing the events within each novel.\n\nBecause Luke Skywalker's best friend is \"you\" (i.e. the reader of the book), the book remains ambiguous about the physical traits (and to extent the personality) of Luke Skywalker's best friend, so that the reader can feel that he or she is truly part of the events. Furthermore, the fate of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] is largely determined by the choices of the reader, making them feel as if they are directly influencing the story. In order to keep continuity simple, each novel assumes that the reader's choices in the previous novels led to each movie's [[canon]]ical ending, albeit with Luke Skywalker's Best Friend involved. For example, although several possible endings for \"A New Hope\" result in the Death Star not being destroyed, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" begins assuming that it was destroyed.\n\nWhile no gender, race, age, or appearance is given, the illustrations in the novels portray Luke Skywalker's Best Friend as a human male about Luke's age with shoulder length hair.\n\n===Alternate biographies===\nDepending on the choices of the reader, the character experiences many different events, all variations on the plot of the original films.\n\n====0 ABY/BBY====\nLuke Skywalker's best friend grew up with Luke on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. One day, Luke purchases [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] only to have [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] escape in search of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Ben Kenobi]]. From here, the reader's choices affect what happens. Among the possibilities are remaining on Tatooine, aiding in the rescue of [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]], foiling the Empire and helping Princess Leia save [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] from destruction, not helping out in the attack on the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] resulting in the Empire building three more, destroying the Death Star, and joining the Empire.\n\n====3 ABY====\nThe novel begins assuming that the events portrayed in A New Hope were fulfilled as they were in the movie resulting in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] relocating to [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]]. Luke Skywalker's Best Friend is a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] in the Rebel Alliance and a member of [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. Among the possibilities are leaving Luke to die at the hands of the [[Wampa/Legends|wampa]], becoming [[Rogue Leader/Legends|Rogue Leader]], being trained by [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] on [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]] with Luke, foiling [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett's]] plan to take Han to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] and rescuing Han, working with Luke to kill [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] in a lightsaber duel, and joining the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] to become a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]].\n\n====4 ABY====\nAgain, the novel begins assuming that everything prior to the start of the novel happened as they did in the movie. Luke Skywalker's Best Friend has been infiltrating Jabba's palace as a guard along with [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]]. The possibilities include betraying your friends to Jabba, killing Jabba, pretending to work with Boba Fett to recapture Han, helping to destroy the shield generator on Endor, helping to destroy the second Death Star, and joining Luke in his battle against Vader and the [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Choose Your Own Star Wars Adventure: A New Hope]]''\n*''[[Choose Your Own Star Wars Adventure: The Empire Strikes Back]]''\n*''[[Choose Your Own Star Wars Adventure: Return of the Jedi]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skywalker, Luke}}\n[[Category:Rebel Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Rogue Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Alliance Military personnel]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Force-users]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
