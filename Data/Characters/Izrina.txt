During a severe drought, however, the [[Tulgah/Legends|Tulgah]] witch [[Morag]] captured the queen. Using evil magic to change Izrina into a being of literal fire, Morag unleashed the queen on the Wistie folk. The spell proved contagious, and soon the flammable creatures caused a large section of forest to catch fire. As the flames encroached on the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] of [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]], threatening their [[Soul Tree]]s, [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]] doused Izrina with water and discovered that this cured her of her fiery affliction. The Ewoks then doused the other infected Wisties and squelched the flames with a special foam made by the shaman [[Logray/Legends|Logray]] while Izrina volunteered her people to guide the airdropping gliders around the dangerous convection currents.\n\nA short while before the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Izrina joined a party of Ewoks in their search for [[Catarine Towani|Catarine]] and [[Jeremitt Towani]], who had crash landed on Endor and became separated from their children, [[Cindel Towani|Cindel]] and [[Mace Towani|Mace]].\n\nIzrina was attracted by a [[Candle of Pure Light|magical candle]] that Logray had presented to Cindel Towani. When the caravan discovered the adult Humans captured by a monstrous [[Gorax/Legends|Gorax]], Izrina distracted the creature and allowed the others to free the captives. After the Gorax had been killed by Mace, Izrina led her friends out of the fortress. Mace told Izrina that their mission couldn't have been a success without her, and after saying farewell to her, Queen Izrina flitted off into the night sky.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn keeping with Mace Towani's pronunciation of her name, the subtitles of the ''Caravan of Courage'' DVD, as well as the [[Disney+]] subtitles, identify her as Ezerina.\n\nIzrina's face at time resembles a [[Givin/Legends|Givin]], but Wisties and Givins are not intended to be genetically related.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Ewoks|The Cries of the Trees}}\n*''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Izrina}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|queenizrina|Izrina, Queen|archivedate=20100906064551}}\n*{{DB|character|cindeltowani|Towani, Cindel|archivedate=20100202232919}}\n*{{SW|url=news/drawing-from-the-imagination-mythological-creatures-in-star-wars-part-2|int=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in Star Wars|text=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in ''Star Wars'', Part 2}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Izrina\n}}\n\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Queens]]\n[[Category:Wisties]]"}}}]}}}}
