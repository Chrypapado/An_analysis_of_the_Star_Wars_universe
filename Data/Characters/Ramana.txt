Ramana was lost in a [[Gambling/Legends|gamble]] by a male Twi'lek, [[Harra (Twi'lek)|Harra]], to [[Doton Het]] on [[Telos IV]]. Ramana was enlisted as a dancer in the [[Cantina/Legends|Cantina]] on Telos IV, being made to dance on the stage along side a band made up of [[Bith/Legends|Bith]].<ref name=\"High Stakes\" /> Though Harra eventually wanted Ramana back, enlisting the aid of [[Meetra Surik]] who freed Ramana though a wager game of [[Pazaak/Legends|Pazaak]]. Ramana came back with Surik to Harra, though Ramana would not stay with Harra. Surik allowed her to leave and go wherever she wished, much to Harra's surprise.<ref name=\"High Stakes\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlternatively, Meetra Surik decided it would be better to buy Ramana from Doton, and leave her to dance in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], allowing her to return later and collect her earnings.<ref name=\"High Stakes\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ramana\n|pl=Ramana\n|fi=Ramana\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
