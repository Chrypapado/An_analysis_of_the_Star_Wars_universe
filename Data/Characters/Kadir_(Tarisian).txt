I'm the janitor for this building.|Kadir|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Kadir''' was an elderly [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who worked as a [[Janitor/Legends|janitor]] at the [[South Apartments]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. However, his quality of work was often complained about, although Kadir claimed to do his best with the resources available to him. In [[3956 BBY]], he encountered [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Carth Onasi]] in the South Apartments, telling them about himself and giving them directions to nearby points of interest.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Oh, I get it! You figure that just because I'm a janitor you don't have to show me any respect. I'm beneath you, is that it?|Kadir|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nBorn on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], Kadir was an elderly [[Gender/Legends|man]]<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> by [[3956 BBY]].<ref name=\"Year\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]'' places the events of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', which includes the appearance of Kadir, in [[3956 BBY]]</ref> In his younger years, he enjoyed going to the [[Upper City Cantina]] for a [[Alcohol/Legends|drink]] and to catch up on the latest news, but as he grew older he began to prefer a more solitary lifestyle. Kadir spent most of his time in the [[South Apartments]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] [[Upper City]], where he worked as a [[Janitor/Legends|janitor]]. The tenants of the South Apartments constantly complained about the messiness of the building, even though Kadir claimed he did the best he could with the equipment that was available to him. He asked several times for an assistant to help him with his work, but his requests were denied by the owners of the building. He found life in the Upper City decent but was wary of the [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gangs]] that were active in the [[Lower City]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nWhen, in 3956 BBY,<ref name=\"Year\" /> [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] [[Attack on the Endar Spire|ambushed and destroyed]] the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'' upon its arrival into the [[Taris system/Legends|Taris system]], two Republic [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Carth Onasi]], managed to flee to the surface of Taris in [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]]. After they crash-landed, they began renting an old, unused room in the South Apartments for use as a hideout. The [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], trying to prevent any surviving Republic forces from leaving, proceeded to capture and quarantine the planet.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nKadir had just finished cleaning the floor of the South Apartments when he was approached by Revan and Onasi. Kadir told the duo about himself, Taris, and his opinion on the Sith, as well as giving them directions to the nearby Upper City [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] and [[Kebla Yurt's Equipment Emporium]]. Revan and Onasi eventually left, and Kadir went back to work cleaning the apartments.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Hmph! You'll change your tune the first time your plumbin' breaks down and raw sewage floods your apartment. Then you'll be beggin' for Kadir to come help you out.|An offended Kadir|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\nKadir was elderly male Human with blue eyes. As such, he had gray hair and light, wrinkled skin.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nKadir was highly sensitive, but friendly and helpful as long as others respected him and did not use his occupation as a source of insult. Residents living illegally in the apartments did not feel the need to hide their activities from Kadir, as he was perceived to be senile and therefore harmless. As a janitor, Kadir was expected to clean the entire South Apartments alone. He did his best but was unable to complete all of his tasks without an assistant or more advanced equipment, which led to complaints from many of the apartment's tenants.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nKadir was content with his occupation and living standards. He had never left and was not planning to leave his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] during the course of his lifetime, and so was unconcerned when the Sith enforced a quarantine in 3956 BBY that banned all [[Starship/Legends|starships]] from entering or leaving Taris.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|This place is a dump!
