I'm excited, too&hellip; more bets means more credits for me!|Ajuur to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Ajuur''' was a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] who found work as a bookmaker for the [[Exchange]], a criminal syndicate, in the [[Upper City Cantina]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. He also owned a [[Taris dueling ring|combat arena]] where duels to the [[Death/Legends|death]] were broadcast as a spectator sport.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[3956 BBY]], the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] conquered Taris from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and outlawed death matches, forcing Ajuur to make battles non-lethal. Nevertheless, the sport remained popular, with gladiators such as [[Ice (duelist)|Ice]], [[Gerlon Two-Fingers]], [[Marl]], [[Twitch (Rodian)|Twitch]], and [[Deadeye Duncan]] rising to fame.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics}}\nAjuur, however, held no qualms about organizing illegal duels for the most famed and mightiest of warriors. When the amnesiac Republic soldier [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] quickly rose as the new champion, Ajuur was ecstatic and offered to have him engage in a death match against the legendary champion [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]]. Though Bendak himself was thrilled at this prospect, Revan ultimately refused.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n===Legacy===\nDuring the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], a [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone trooper]] made a joke about Ajuur: \"The Captain put you on the test in Ajuur the Hutt's arena, are you ready to fight?\" When another asked \"Why\", he answered \"because you laugh!\" (In French, \"you laugh\" translates into \"T'as ris\", which has a similar pronuncation with the planet where the arena is, \"Taris\".){{Fact}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAjuur first appeared as a non-player character in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', a [[2003]] [[video game]] produced by [[BioWare]]. In the game, the player, Revan, can choose to fight in his arena. However, the nature of the encounter is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment. Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with him and, if so, what form that interaction took.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIf the player defeats all other duelists in the ring, Ajuur offers to set up a death match with Starkiller in a non-canonical [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] outcome. Upon successfully defeating Starkiller, Ajuur gives the player their pay along with Bendak's [[Mandalorian blaster|blaster]]. Ajuur can also be persuaded or threatened to increase the reward. Additionally, there is a bug in the game that can result in him giving the player Bendak's blaster twice.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nHis voicework was provided by [[Neil Kaplan]]{{Fact}}. Unlike most non-[[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] speaking characters in the game, he would speak his name if it was in the subtitles. He would also say Bendak Starkiller's name under similar circumstances. He shares this trait with [[Gluupor]] and [[Motta]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures (video game)]]'' <small>(Mentioned only in the French version)</small>\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ajuur#legends\n|es=Ajuur\n|nl=Ajuur\n|pl=Ajuur\n|ru=\u0410\u0434\u0436\u0443\u0443\u0440\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]"}}}]}}}}
