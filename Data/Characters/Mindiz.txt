When the [[Galactic Empire]] conquered Lothal, the tyrannical government started taking over the local peasants' lands. Mindiz' [[parent]]s tried to resist the Empire, but were taken away as a result, leaving their daughter on her own at a young age.<ref name=\"Sabotaged\" /> By [[4 BBY]],{{Fact}} Mindiz lived in the Lothalian slum of [[Lothal re-settlement camp 43|Tarkintown]], where she was one of the youngest residents. In Tarkintown, she became acquainted with the [[Spectres]], a band of freedom fighters who used to distribute food supplies to the poor. She developed a special relationship with [[Garazeb Orrelios]], a [[Lasat]] warrior. She also found an ally in Mister [[Mulb]], a Tarkintown resident who looked after her.<ref name=\"Sabotaged\" />\n\nOne day, the Spectres came to Tarkintown to distribute crates of fruits, and Mindiz turned up to have her share. However, after taking a bite of a [[jogan fruit]] that Orrelios had handed to her, she became suddenly ill and felt unconscious. It appeared that the crates had all been [[poison]]ed. Because the Lasat warrior felt responsible for what had happened to Mindiz, he decided to raid the medical facility of the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Command Center]] in [[Capital City]]. A short time later, Mindiz was cured and she woke up with her Lasat friend at her side.<ref name=\"Sabotaged\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWRMCite|7|Sabotaged Supplies}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Mindiz\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lothalites]]"}}}]}}}}
