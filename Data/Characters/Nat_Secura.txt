He was also the [[Clan Secura|Secura]] heir.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]], Secura was kidnapped by two [[Morgukai]] in service of [[Kh'aris Fenn]]. He was put in the dungeon of Kh'aris' fortress together with [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Tholme/Legends|Tholme]], who attempted to rescue the young [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]]. When the torture droid [[AX/RX]] was ordered to execute both prisoners Tholme attacked the droid and another [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]], entered the prison cell and beheaded the droid. He escaped the fortress safely with Tholme, while Aayla helped her master, [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]], defeat the two [[Nikto/Legends|Nikto]] Morgukai.\n\nWhen [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna]] returned to [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] for his revenge against his people, Secura was severely scarred, especially his [[Lekku/Legends|lekku]] which kept him from speaking in [[Twi'leki/Legends|Twi'leki]]. His mother chastised Bib and was executed by him, after this he was treated by Bib and taken away from Ryloth.\n\nLater, when he was older, Bib Fortuna kept Secura in [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]]. In order to \"save\" Secura from the [[Jabba's rancor|rancor]], Fortuna had the [[B'omarr Order/Legends|B'omarr Monks]] remove Secura's brain. Secura's lifeless body was fed to the Rancor while his brain remained safely enclosed in a B'omarr monk spider walker.\n\nSecura soon began suffering from mental insanity as he was not prepared to deal with his new horrific predicament. The monks warned Fortuna that if he did not find a new host body for Secura within a short time he might go mad and die as a result. Fortuna planned to find cloners to [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] Secura a new body. Until then, Secura wanted to inhabit the carbon-frozen body of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and so his friend began plotting a way to steal the body from under [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] nose. However, plans went awry after Solo and his friends escaped Jabba's clutches. Secura remained in his brain walker along with several new \"initiates\" to the B'omarr Monks, including Fortuna. He helped Fortuna get used to his [[BT-16 perimeter droid|brain walker]] and eventually they both escaped the palace.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Riteofpassage_mistake.jpg|thumb|Tholme making a mistake by calling Nat Secura \"Lon\", which is the name of his father.]]\n\nAfter Jedi Secura rescued Tholme and Secura, Tholme introduces the little Secura to his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]]. But instead of calling him Nat, he calls the boy Lon, which is his father's name.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 42|''Star Wars'' (1998) 42]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 43|''Star Wars'' (1998) 43]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 44|''Star Wars'' (1998) 44]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 45|''Star Wars'' (1998) 45]]\n*''[[Of the Day's Annoyances: Bib Fortuna's Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|102|TWI27-28, ''Twi'leks''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nat Secura\n|hu=Nat Secura\n|pl=Nat Secura\n|ru=\u041d\u0430\u0442 \u0421\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secura, Nat}}\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rutian Twi'leks]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
