In my work for Zsinj, it has become a cherished responsibility.|General Melvar|The Courtship of Princess Leia}}\n[[General/Legends|General]] '''Melvar''' was the right-hand man of [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] originally from [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]], carrying a common Human surname,<ref name=\"GCG\">''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]'', p. 115</ref> Melvar was a fanatical follower of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. He had what was labeled \"Patriotic psychosis\", an obsessive love of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\nHe was part of [[Destab]], but was removed from the field as a \"tactical liability\" and placed with [[IntCon]] and assigned to the [[Iron Fist (Victory-class)|''Iron Fist'']].<ref name=\"Threat Dossier\">''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''</ref>\n\nWhen Zsinj went rogue, Melvar became his top [[General/Legends|General]], though he was rather young at the time. He would often sneak up on Zsinj, something which the warlord found irritating at the most. Much like Zsinj, he enjoyed using deceit against his foes&mdash;his features, normally bland and nondescript (Zsinj knew he had at least a dozen false identities on various worlds) could be made to look savage and sadistic. [[Gara Petothel]] said he had \"the cruelest features ever seen on a Human being.\"\n\nMelvar was also depicted as being extremely sadistic, having his fingernails removed and replaced with [[cuticle implant]]s to provide him with an immediate [[Torture/Legends|torture]] device that also gave him multiple facial scars. It was unclear if these nails and scars were real or part of one of his acts&mdash;his features were always bland around the warlord and the nails were only seen in the presence of his enemies.\n\nHe was also involved with Zsinj's intelligence divisions. When [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] was captured by the [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]], Melvar went down to take formal possession of Solo, along with a transport shuttle to take the Nightsisters off [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]]. [[Gethzerion]] thanked him in a unique way&mdash;giving him a simple [[Death/Legends|death]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''\n*''[[The Courtship of Princess Leia]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Melvar\n}}\n\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army generals]]\n[[Category:Kuati]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Zsinj's empire]]"}}}]}}}}
