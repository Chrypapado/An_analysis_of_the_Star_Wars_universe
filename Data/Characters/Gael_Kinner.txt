Never thought that bucket would have got off [[Tolea Biqua|TB]].|Gael Kinner|The Price of Business}}\n'''Gael Kinner''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and member of the [[Blood Raptors]] gang.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], Kinner was selected to race his [[G-59 Cannibalizer]] through the [[Eskaron]] tunnels against [[Teeloo]]. The Raptors had impounded Teeloo's cargo in punishment for him accidentally crashing with one of their ships. They also humiliated him with a mandatory race through Eskaron, betting his cargo against his ship, the ''[[Neeva-Beelo]]'' &mdash; although the Raptors tried to keep the cargo plus the ship, no matter the result of the race, and some of them attempted to sabotage the ship.\n\nIn the middle of the race, Kinner's and Teeloo's path crossed with that being used by another race. Kinner shot at and destroyed the lead ship of the other race to avoid colliding with it. That ship was one of [[Nirama]]'s, and the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] was most displeased to lose his pilot [[Arraxx]], his ship, and the race.\n\nAfter Kinner's race against Teeloo was finished, Nirama's lieutenant [[Len Markus]] collected Teeloo's crew, Kinner, and some of his fellow Blood Raptors. They were taken to Nirama's headquarters in [[Mikish]]. After sorting out what had happened, Nirama released Teeloo and his crew, deeming that the Raptors were the guilty party. Nirama fed one of the Blood Raptors to the [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] at the [[Bollin Exotic Animal Emporium]]. Being the one that destroyed Nirama's ship, it might have been Gael that suffered that fate.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Price of Business]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kinner, Gael}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
