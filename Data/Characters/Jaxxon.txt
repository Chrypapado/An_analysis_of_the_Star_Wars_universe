You can call me Jax for short&hellip;which I ain't.|Jaxxon|Star Wars (1977) 8}}\n'''Jaxxon''' was a quick-witted [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] from [[Coachelle Prime/Legends|Coachelle Prime]]. The most rambunctious of his family's thirteen children, he left his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] at an early age, after stealing an unprotected [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]]. He made his way to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], where he began to perform odd jobs, quickly becoming familiar with the important elements of fringe culture. After a short stint as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]], he decided to try his hand at smuggling, and he bought a [[WUD-500 star yacht/Legends|WUD-500 star yacht]], christening it the [[Rabbit's Foot/Legends|''Rabbit's Foot'']]. However, the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] was fraught with mechanical problems and he was forced to land at the shady [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] of [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]]. Needing to acquire funds in order to make repairs, he accepted a job from [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and became part of the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]], a mercenary force tasked with defending the small village of [[Onacra]]. After [[Battle of Aduba-3|protecting]] the community from [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]], the group was forced to fight off the [[Behemoth from the World Below]]. Due to Solo's efforts, the giant monster was killed, and Jaxxon was able to get the money needed to repair his ship.\n\nLater, Jaxxon paired up with one of his fellow Star-Hoppers, [[Amaiza Foxtrain/Legends|Amaiza Foxtrain]], to help him in his smuggling business. Using her skill at [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]], the two eventually built up enough [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]] to modify the ''Rabbit's Foot'' considerably, making it a formidable smuggling vessel. A short time after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] loyal to [[Beilert Valance/Legends|Beilert Valance]], who were looking for clues to the whereabouts of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], captured Jaxxon. The hunters had inadvertently confused one of Jaxxon's fellow Star-Hoppers, [[Jimm Doshun]], with Skywalker, and knew that Jaxxon would know his location. After prying the location of Aduba-3 from Jaxxon, Valance and his crew went to the world to capture \"Skywalker.\" However, Jaxxon and Foxtrain got there first, and in a carefully executed plan they were able to defeat Valance's men, leaving only him alive at the end of the encounter. Once Valance had realized his mistake, he fled from Aduba-3, claiming that the Star-Hoppers would never stop him from locating his quarry.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nJaxxon was born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coachelle Prime/Legends|Coachelle Prime]] to a small family by [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]] standards. One of thirteen children, Jaxxon was the most rambunctious of the bunch and had dreams of seeing [[The galaxy/Legends|the larger galaxy]]. However, his family was quite conservative, keeping a quiet house, and his [[Jaxxon's mother|mother]] had hopes that Jaxxon would grow out of his restlessness and settle down, hopefully to marry a nice girl and father a large family. Despite his mother's hopes, Jaxxon remained uncontrollable, and even before his teenage years, he had spent a decent amount of time in the planet's juvenile remand centers. As the odd one out among his family, Jaxxon decided to go off-world. At the age of twelve, he stole a poorly-guarded [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] and headed for parts unknown.<ref name=\"Starhoppers\" /><ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" />\n\nOn a course for the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], Jaxxon eventually landed on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], the [[Smuggler/Legends|Smuggler's]] [[Moon/Legends|Moon]]. Although he had neglected his studies on his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], Jaxxon quickly took to his new life on his own, becoming well-schooled in the elements of fringe culture and streetwise survival. To earn a living, Jaxxon began taking on assorted odd jobs, eventually falling into a tougher crowd.<ref name=\"Starhoppers\" /><ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" /> By the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], there was a price on his head.<ref name=\"Invitation Only\">''[[The Clone Wars: Invitation Only]]''</ref> He joined the [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] squad known as the [[Boys of Corus]] a short time later. Based out of the [[Corus system]], the group helped Jaxxon hone his marksmanship skills, and he was soon well-versed in the use of weaponry. However, during one operation in the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], the group was subject to a double-cross by their employers. The event marked the end of the mercenary squad, and Jaxxon returned to Nar Shaddaa without a steady-paying job.<ref name=\"Starhoppers\" /><ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" />\n\nStarved for a source of income, Jaxxon decided to pursue a career in smuggling. With the small amount of funds that he had saved up, Jaxxon invested in a [[WUD-500 star yacht/Legends|WUD-500]] [[Starship/Legends|starship]], a beat-up freighter that he christened the [[Rabbit's Foot/Legends|''Rabbit's Foot'']]. However, the used [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] craft was rife with problems. On a run through the [[Aduba system]], mechanical problems forced Jaxxon to make a stop on the planet of [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]]. Stuck until he could repair his [[Starship/Legends|starship]], Jaxxon set out to gather supplies to begin fixing the ''Rabbit's Foot''.<ref name=\"Starhoppers\" /><ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" />\n\n===Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3===\n{{Quote|I saw that, rabbit&hellip;''\"<br />\"''Well, hooray for your side!

Hoping to make use of his mercenary background, Jaxxon answered the call, lining up outside the employer's door with several other hopefuls.<ref name=\"Eight for Aduba-3\" /> The hirer turned out to be none other than [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], a famed smuggler, who, along with his [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] co-[[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], was lying low on the world to avoid the [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on his head placed by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]].<ref name=\"New Planets, New Perils\">[[Star Wars (1977) 7|''Star Wars'' (1977) 7]]</ref> While there, Solo had answered the pleas of [[Ramiz]], a villager from the nearby village of [[Onacra]], to protect his people from the murderous gang known as the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]]. To help him in this endeavor, Solo had decided to recruit as many of the locals as he could.<ref name=\"Eight for Aduba-3\" />\n\n[[File:Jaxxon.png|thumb|left|250px|Jaxxon takes out [[Warto]].]]\n\nAfter the first ten hopefuls had been rejected by Solo, the next three, including the [[Spiner]] [[Hedji]], the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Amaiza Foxtrain/Legends|Amaiza Foxtrain]], and the purported [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Don-Wan Kihotay]], were all accepted into Solo's band. As the next in line, Jaxxon had become incredibly impatient, and he urged the ancient Kihotay to hurry out of Solo's room. However, before Jaxxon could make it into the room to meet Solo, he was pushed out of the way by [[Warto]], a [[Boltrunian/Legends|Boltrunian]] thug that insisted that he needed to be next to meet with the employer. Jaxxon attempted to dissuade Warto, but the Boltrunian simply turned and hit Jaxxon, knocking him to the floor. Irritated by Warto's tactics, Jaxxon responded by kicking the Boltrunian with his powerful legs, propelling him down a flight of stairs. The confrontation happened to be witnessed by Solo, and, impressed by the Lepi's fighting skills, he offered him a place in the slowly growing mercenary band. Jaxxon accepted and agreed to meet with the rest of the group at dawn the next morning. Solo completed the group by hiring [[Jimm Doshun]] and [[FE-9Q]] after Jaxxon had left. The [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]] were complete.<ref name=\"Eight for Aduba-3\" />\n\nAt dawn, the Star-Hoppers met and began to familiarize themselves with one another as Solo laid out the plan to defend Onacra from the Cloud-Riders. However, just as Solo had begun to explain, the Cloud-Riders appeared on their [[Peregrine-340 airspeeder|skyspeeders]], having heard of the group that was set to oppose them. Solo and the Cloud-Riders' leader, [[Serji-X Arrogantus]], began to negotiate over the upcoming battle, but neither would back down. As the Cloud-Riders prepared to leave, Jaxxon was surprised to see that Warto had actually joined the Cloud-Riders, intent on getting revenge against Jaxxon and Solo, who had brawled with the Boltrunian before he had tried to tangle with Jaxxon. With a feeling of foreboding in the air, the Star-Hoppers secured a group of [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] for riding and made their way towards Onacra.<ref name=\"Eight for Aduba-3\" />\n\n===Onward to Onacra===\n{{Quote|Well, we might as well be killed by things with feathers as bandits with blasters. Come on, you Star-Hoppers&mdash;let's go get 'em!|Han Solo|Star Wars (1977) 9}}\nOn the outskirts of the village, Solo spotted a large group of predators flying through the air. Doshun, the only native to Aduba-3 identified the birds as [[high-hound]]s, large beasts that were known to attack the people's crop of [[maze-stalk]]s. Since the Star-Hoppers had been tasked with protecting the village, Solo rallied the group to action, and they began to fend off the high-hounds. With a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] in each hand, Jaxxon killed many of the beasts before they decided to scatter. During the fighting, Jaxxon began to fall into sync with Foxtrain, and together, the two blew apart many of the creatures. Although Jaxxon attempted to flirt with the woman, claiming that they could make \"beautiful blaster-music\" together, Foxtrain fended off his advances, adverse to working with someone who looked like a \"big green rabbit.\"<ref name=\"Showdown on a Wasteland World\">[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]]</ref>\n\nAs the high-hounds fled from their attackers, the Star-Hoppers made their way into the village. After tethering their banthas in a local stable, the group began to unload their munitions that they had brought with them. As the last of the weapons and [[power pack]]s had been unloaded from their mounts, the Star-Hoppers were confronted by the [[Old One]], who claimed that they were not needed, and that he would be able to summon a [[Behemoth from the World Below|great monster]] to save the village. Solo shrugged off the old man's apparent delusions, and began to ready his force to combat the Cloud-Riders. As the Star-Hoppers prepared themselves, Jaxxon was the first to spot the Cloud-Riders advancing on the village, with Arrogantus in the lead, firing his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] wildly.<ref name=\"Showdown on a Wasteland World\" />\n\n[[File:Jaxxon3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jaxxon fights alongside [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].]]\n\n===Showdown===\n{{Quote|All right, then, if these space-rats are so anxious to die&mdash;let's give them what they want!|Serji-X Arrogantus|Star Wars (1977) 9}}\nAs the Cloud-Riders [[Battle of Aduba-3|descended]] on the village, Jaxxon and the Star-Hoppers immediately began to open fire. Although drastically outnumbered, the group put up a strong fight, blasting the Cloud-Riders off their mounts. However, the intensity of the fighting eventually saw FE-9Q destroyed due to a sneak-attack from the ground. The same attack also saw Don-Wan Kihotay badly wounded, taking him out of the fight.<ref name=\"Showdown on a Wasteland World\" />\n\nThe Star-Hoppers continued to fight on, eventually eliminating those that were attempting to attack from the rear. Although they had come fully stocked with additional weaponry, Solo began to worry about running out of ammunition, as a renewed attack by the Cloud-Riders came upon the village. However, before the attack could come, the Star-Hoppers were surprised by a new factor. The Old One, who had been busy performing a ritual, even as the battle raged around him, had actually summoned his monster.<ref name=\"Showdown on a Wasteland World\" /> The Behemoth from the World Below, a centuries old beast originally created by the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Seviss Vaa]], had been awoken by the ancient Aduban elder.<ref name=\"Starhoppers\" />\n\n===Battle with a monster===\n{{Quote|The Starkiller kid ain't just supposin', Solo! Without the Shaman to call the shots, that Behemoth's startin to get really mad!

Using a lightning attack from its forehead, the beast had soon nearly wiped out all of Arrogantus' forces. The Cloud-Riders began to charge the Behemoth, trying to destroy it, but they were unable to stop the monster's rampage. As the Behemoth destroyed their opponents, the Star-Hoppers decided to lay low, letting the monster defeat their adversaries for them. Consequently, the Behemoth seemed to ignore the Star-Hoppers completely, and it appeared that the Cloud-Riders would be wiped out without another shot being fired. However, Arrogantus was able to spot the Old One, gesturing towards the Behemoth as though he was controlling its actions. Believing that taking out the Old One would stop the beast's rampage, Arrogantus charged the ancient man. Just as he was about to crash into him, both Arrogantus and the Old One were crushed by the Behemoth with a large stamp of its foot. With their leader dead, the rest of the Cloud-Riders quickly succumbed to the Behemoth's assault.<ref name=\"Behemoth from the World Below\">[[Star Wars (1977) 10|''Star Wars'' (1977) 10]]</ref><ref name=\"Beast Motive\">During [[Star Wars (1977) 10|''Star Wars'' (1977) 10]], the narrator leaves the motives of the monster ambiguous. Although it is implied that the Old One actually had power over the monster, and he kept the Behemoth from attacking the Star-Hoppers, whether the monster was actually being controlled by the Old One is never fully confirmed. The Old One's death by an attack from the Behemoth leaves the true motives of the monster in doubt.</ref>\n\nSince the Cloud-Riders had been destroyed, several of the Star-Hoppers proposed leaving the village. After all, they had only been hired to defend Onacra from the Cloud-Riders, not from a near-unbeatable beast. However, Solo claimed that there would be no reward if they didn't protect the village from being destroyed. With the Old One dead, the monster was likely to rampage through the village, and Solo demanded that the Star-Hoppers stay to defend the people. Jaxxon, who had tired of just sitting around, immediately jumped out from his hiding place and began to charge the monster, firing his blaster, though the Behemoth was too quick for the Lepi, nearly killing him with a deadly blast of lightning. Jaxxon avoided the deadly fire, but the aftershock of the blast caused a small landslide, knocking Jaxxon's weapon out of his hand. As the Lepi smuggler tried to retrieve his weapon, Foxtrain, who was concerned for his safety, yelled at him to get back to his hiding place. Jaxxon teased the woman about her sudden interest for his welfare, but decided to go for his blaster anyway. Jaxxon regained his weapon, but escaping was another matter. Foxtrain and Jaxxon returned to the other Star-Hoppers, but only after they had both sustained minor injuries from the rubble that the beast was creating with his [[Laser/Legends|laser]] blasts.<ref name=\"Behemoth from the World Below\" />\n\nBack with the group, Solo suggested that they just lay low, and hopefully the beast would believe that he had killed them. Unfortunately for the Star-Hoppers, the Behemoth continued to fire shots near their location, and Jaxxon and the rest of the group were forced to run, both from the monster and the landslides he was creating with his attacks. As Solo began to formulate another plan, the Star-Hoppers were surprised to see Don-Wan Kihotay out from their hiding place. Wielding his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], the man had decided to face the Behemoth in single combat. Although the majority of the Star-Hoppers were unsure of how to respond, Hedji charged out to rescue the old man, but he was quickly killed by the Behemoth. As the remaining Star-Hoppers watched Don-Wan Kihotay attempt to attack the beast, Solo noticed that the old man's lightsaber was repelling the Behemoth's attack. Surmising that the lightsaber was the key to defeating the monster, Solo took the man's lightsaber and plunged it into the Behemoth. The monster began to spasm from the attack, thrashing wildly and firing its laser. In a burst of light, the creature disintegrated, ending its threat to the village. Victorious, the Star-Hoppers claimed their reward and returned to the spaceport in [[Tun Aduban]].<ref name=\"Behemoth from the World Below\" />\n\n===Further exploits===\n{{Quote|Uh&hellip;I'd ask what's up, guys&mdash;but it feels like I am.|Jaxxon, after being tied up in the air by [[Beilert Valance/Legends|Beilert Valance's]] men|Star Wars (1977) 16}}\n[[File:Jaxxon4.jpg|thumb|right|Jaxxon being tortured by Beilert Valance's men.]]\n\nWith the funds he had earned from the Onacra villagers, Jaxxon was able to repair his ship.<ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" /> Having formed a good friendship with Foxtrain over the course of the Onacra battle, he decided to ask her to join him in his smuggling career. She had come to Aduba-3 to find a job after her pirating career had abruptly ended, and so she accepted Jaxxon's offer. The duo set up shop at Jaxxon's old residence on Nar Shaddaa,<ref name=\"Starhoppers\" /> where they began to build up the ''Rabbit's Foot'' to prime condition for smuggling operations.<ref name=\"The Hunter\">[[Star Wars (1977) 16|''Star Wars'' (1977) 16]]</ref> Due to her skill at [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]], the two were quickly able to increase their meager funds into enough to modify their ship. The ''Rabbit's Foot'' was soon equipped with augmented [[Deflector shield/Legends|shielding]], advanced weaponry, and its previous mechanical problems were excised. Now with a capable ship, the duo's smuggling operation was able to begin.<ref name=\"The Hunter\" />\n\nDuring one of their nights on Nar Shaddaa, Jaxxon tried to convince Foxtrain to come with him for a night on the town. However, she refused the offer, claiming that high life on backwater worlds could quickly become lowlife. After promising to oversee the ship's [[Fuel/Legends|refueling]], she left Jaxxon to see the sights on his own. Immediately after Foxtrain had bid him farewell, Jaxxon began to stroll through the streets of the city, concentrating on how much he had grown to like the woman. However, as he walked under an overpass, he was suddenly draped in an [[Electroshock net|electro-net]]. The shock of the device quickly knocked Jaxxon into unconsciousness, and he woke up to find himself hanging upside down amongst a group of [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] led by [[Dafi (bounty hunter)|Dafi]] and [[Remel Fud]]. The group was working for [[Beilert Valance/Legends|Beilert Valance]], and had overheard Don-Wan Kihotay mention Han Solo, Jaxxon, and \"the kid\" during an [[Attack on Anglebay Station|attack]] on [[Anglebay Station]], where Kihotay was receiving treatment. Believing \"the kid\" to be [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] rather than Jimm Doshun, the hunters had tracked down Jaxxon in order to discover the world where the Star-Hoppers had fought together. The hunters were under the impression that they would be able to find Skywalker on that planet, and Jaxxon happened to be the easiest member of the Star-Hoppers to find.<ref name=\"The Hunter\" />\n\nAttaching an [[The Agony Inducer|agony inducer]] to his ear, Fud began to interrogate the Lepi, but Jaxxon refused to tell them anything. To force him to talk, Dafi activated the agony inducer, filling Jaxxon's body with pain. However, he still refused to tell them anything, merely cursing them for their lowlife tactics. The hunters decided to just continue the [[Torture/Legends|torture]], until Jaxxon would give them the information; but before they could continue, they began to be cut down by blaster fire. Foxtrain had decided to come back to rejoin Jaxxon, and finding him at the mercy of the bounty hunters, she quickly dispatched the majority of them. As she approached her partner to untie him, she let slip that it was just like old times on Aduba-3. One of the hunters who had survived Foxtrain's assault overheard the information and fled back to Valance, telling him that \"the kid\" was on Aduba-3.<ref name=\"The Hunter\" />\n\n===Back to Aduba-3===\n{{Quote|Not bad, eh, gorgeous?

Foxtrain and Jaxxon resolved to get there first and stop Valance from attacking their friends. Due to the superior speed of the ''Rabbit's Foot'', the duo made their way to Aduba-3 well before their opponents, warning Doshun and his wife, [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri]], that bounty hunters were coming to the world to capture him. Although Doshun was in disbelief over their story, he agreed to help them prepare for the hunters' attack, rallying the villagers in Onacra and preparing them for an outside assault. As the people of Onacra prepared themselves, Foxtrain and Jaxxon went back into [[Realspace/Legends|space]] to prepare for Valance's arrival. When Valance's ship dropped out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] above the planet, Jaxxon opened fire, surprising the bounty hunters and damaging their vessel. Although Jaxxon was optimistic of their chances of defeating the crew in space, Foxtrain doubted that their much smaller craft would be able to destroy Valance's ship. True to her predictions, Valance and the hunters regained their composure and fired on the ''Rabbit's Foot'' with their [[Blaster cannon/Legends|blaster cannons]]. The metal plating on Jaxxon's ship was damaged, and he was forced to crash-land on the outskirts of the village.<ref name=\"The Hunter\" />\n\nAfter crashing their ship, Jaxxon and Foxtrain immediately departed the ''Rabbit's Foot'' and hid in the tall grasses nearby. Once Valance's crew had landed, Valance sent out a first squad commanded by [[Slssk]] to search the crashed ship. When Slzzk's group was in range, Jaxxon and Foxtrain opened fire, pinning them between their attack and their downed ship. Although the group tried to mount a counter-attack, before they could advance on the duo, Doshun and the villagers incited a stampede of the local banthas. The large creatures trampled through the hunters' formations, killing nearly their entire force, save Slzzk and Valance. Foxtrain picked off Slzzk when he showed his head through the reeds, and Valance was quickly captured by the group when he tried to mount a similar attack. With the bounty hunter leader before them, Jaxxon quickly questioned the man as to what he wanted with Doshun. As Valance heard the name, he realized that he had come for the wrong boy. Laughing bitterly over the fruitless endeavor that had cost him his entire crew, Valance abruptly opened fire on the group with a blaster contained in his [[Cybernetics/Legends|artificial]] left hand. However, quick reflexes saved Jaxxon and his comrades, and they were able to jump out of the way of the attack. Valance fled back to his ship, rocketing away from Aduba-3, intent on tracking down the real Skywalker this time. The group was quite confused as to the turn of events but were happy that the attack was over. Leaving Doshun with his people, Jaxxon and Foxtrain returned to their smuggling business.<ref name=\"The Hunter\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|But y'know how us rocket rabbit types are: We just can't stand still!!|Jaxxon|Star Wars (1977) 10}}\nJaxxon was a quick-witted individual with a street smart personality and a quick temper.<ref name=\"Starhoppers\" /> Tall and lanky, with a large pair of buck teeth and short green fur, he easily stood out in a crowd and was often the victim of stabbing insults for his peculiar appearance.<ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" /> However, Jaxxon always responded in kind to these rude responses, giving his attackers a strong kick in the chest or a blaster shot to the face.<ref name=\"Eight for Aduba-3\" /><ref name=\"Showdown on a Wasteland World\" /> Jaxxon was not hesitant to speak his mind, constantly voicing his complaints during the operation on Aduba-3, much to Han Solo's irritation.

A large anthropomorphic bunny, he was created in homage to [[Wikipedia:Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] cartoon star [[Wikipedia:Bugs Bunny|Bugs Bunny]]<ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" /> who often addressed strangers with the generic nickname \"Jackson\" in his 1940s cartoons. As a member of a band of mercenaries brought together by Han Solo, Jaxxon joined the group on a quest to free the local Adubans from the tyrannical Serji-X Arrogantus. This story, inspired by the film [[Wikipedia:The Seven Samurai|''The Seven Samurai'']],<ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" /> was one of the earliest stories to appear in the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]], making Jaxxon one of the first characters to be created outside the films.<ref name=\"DatabankJaxxon\" /> After [[Archie Goodwin]] took control of the storyline in [[Star Wars (1977) 11|''Star Wars'' (1977) 11]], Jaxxon played a much smaller role in the comic. He was seen in a flashback in issue 11, and played a small role in [[Star Wars (1977) 16|''Star Wars'' (1977) 16]], before departing fully from the storyline. Jaxxon's abrupt departure caused some fans to surmise that [[George Lucas]] himself had asked that Jaxxon make no more appearances. However, this rumor is unsubstantiated.<ref name=\"Pablo the Jaxxon fan\">{{SWBoards|url=thread.jspa?threadID=278|thread=Jaxxon Fans!

He was brought out of obscurity in the [[2001]] ''[[Star Wars Gamer 4]] '' article ''[[The Starhoppers of Aduba-3]]'', by [[Pablo Hidalgo]], [[Cory J. Herndon]], and [[Michael Mikaelian]]. This article gave background information on Jaxxon and his species, as well as summarizing his actions in the Marvel run. Akin to the creators of Jaxxon, Hidalgo drew inspiration from Bugs Bunny in his choice of Coachelle as Jaxxon's homeworld. In the 1953 short \"[[Wikipedia:Bully for Bugs|Bully for Bugs]],\" Bugs asks, \"Excuse me, can you direct me to the Coachella Valley and the Giant Carrot Festival&hellip;therein?\" Hidalgo carefully mirrored this sentence during the article, also ending his in \"therein.\" Additionally, Hidalgo drew references to another [[Wikipedia:Looney Tunes|Looney Tunes]] short, \"[[Wikipedia:What's Up Doc? (cartoon)|What's Up Doc?]],\" when mentioning Jaxxon's former mercenary group, the Boys of Corus. These references to Bugs Bunny were not without precedent, as Goodwin also played up this relationship in ''Star Wars 16: The Hunter'', naming two bounty hunters that were trying to capture Jaxxon as Dafi and Fud. These names were references to the Looney Tunes characters [[Wikipedia:Daffy Duck|Daffy Duck]] and [[Wikipedia:Elmer Fudd|Elmer Fudd]], who were constantly trying to capture Bugs.<ref name=\"Gamer Endnotes\">{{Blog|pablog|60|Tales of the Big Green Bunny: Behind the Scenes of Gamer #4 &mdash; The Coachella Valley, and the Giant Carrot Festival|Fragments from the Mind's Eye|Pablo Hidalgo|archivedate=20090107202956}}</ref>\n\nAlthough popular with several ''[[Star Wars]]'' authors, such as [[Jeff Grubb]],<ref name=\"Jeff Grubb interview\">{{WizardsCite|url=starwars/article.asp?x=sw20020523dchat&c=rpg|text=Hutts, New Fish, and Bunnies: Featuring Jeff Grubb|int=Hutts, New Fish, and Bunnies: Featuring Jeff Grubb|archivedate=20021001152356}}</ref> [[Joseph Bongiorno]],<ref name=\"Pablo the Jaxxon fan\" /> [[Abel G.

He was also claimed to be \"Marvel's most-infamous addition to the Expanded Universe\" in ''[[Comic Marvels]]'', an article in [[Star Wars Insider 91|''Star Wars Insider'' 91]]. This factor has led to Jaxxon being equated with the [[prequel trilogy]] character [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] on several occasions.<ref name=\"Jaxxon: The Green Rabbit\" /><ref name=\"Doomworld\">Foreword to ''[[Star Wars: A Long Time Ago&hellip; Volume 1: Doomworld]]'', written by Lee Dawson</ref><ref name=\"Classic Moment\">{{InsiderCite|133|Classic Moment}}</ref> In addition, Jaxxon's lack of popularity has been shown in polls on [[StarWars.com]].

Since Pablo Hidalgo, writer and illustrator of ''Rookies: Rendezvous'', is a known fan of Jaxxon, it has led some fans to believe the Lepi is in fact Jaxxon. This speculation is based on Hidalgo's mention of \"a big green bunny\" appearing in this strip on his blog,<ref name=\"Rookies Endnotes\">{{Blog|pablog|56|Rookies: Rendezvous -- Week Eight Annotations|Fragments from the Mind's Eye|Pablo Hidalgo|archivedate=20080906192343}}</ref> a term that he has used several times on message boards and blogs when referring to Jaxxon.<ref name=\"Gamer Endnotes\" /><ref name=\"Pablo the Jaxxon fan\" />\n[[File:Star_Wars_Marvel_2015_Jaxxon_Variant.jpg|thumb|Jaxxon's cameo in the party variant cover of ''Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes'']]\nJaxxon's most recent \"appearance\" was in the ''[[The Clone Wars: Invitation Only]]'' web comic by Pablo Hidalgo and [[Tom Hodges]], where he can be seen on a \"Wanted\" poster. His name is written in the [[Aurebesh/Legends|Aurebesh]] below the picture. In the original webcomic, the name is partially obscured by a big, red stain; in the ''[[Star Wars: Tales from The Clone Wars Webcomic Collection Season 1|Star Wars: Tales from the Clone Wars]]'' reprint, the stain is missing and the poster definitely says \"Jaxxon\".\n\nIn [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|''The Clone Wars'']] episode ''[[A Sunny Day in the Void]]'', the [[Skeleton/Legends|skeleton]] found in a crashed [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] wears a suit similar to Jaxxon.
