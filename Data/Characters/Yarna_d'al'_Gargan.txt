She was captured by [[slaver]]s and transported to the [[desert]] [[planet]] of [[Tatooine]], where the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] bought her. As an [[Slavery|enslaved]] being, she was forced to serve him as a dancing girl at [[Jabba's Palace|his palace]]. While working alongside a young [[Twi'lek]] called [[Oola]], she was present for Oola's execution and the arrival of [[Luke Skywalker]] at the palace. She escaped after Jabba's [[death]] and recovered her kidnapped [[Youngling|cublings]] from his [[Desilijic Complex|townhouse]].\n\n==Biography==\nYarna d'al' Gargan was an [[Askajian]] [[Gender|female]] with [[Color|dark brown]] [[hair]] who came from [[Askaji]],<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> a [[planet]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name=\"SW:TFA Beginner Game\">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Beginner Game|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' Beginner Game]]</ref> Her people lived in tribes led by chiefs, one of whom was her [[Parent|father]],<ref name=\"Alien Archive\">''[[Star Wars: Alien Archive]]''</ref> and she would dance for the honor of her tribe. She was [[Marriage|married]] to [[Nautag]] and the mother of four [[Youngling|cublings]]. One [[Standard day|day]], however, she and her family were captured by [[slaver]]s and brought to the [[desert]] planet [[Tatooine]], where the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] bought them. When Nautag attempted to rebel, the Hutt fed him to his pet [[rancor]],<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> [[Pateesa]],<ref name=\"Aftermath: Life Debt\">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref> and Yarna's cublings were sent to Jabba's [[Desilijic Complex|townhouse]] in [[Mos Eisley]].<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" />\n\nJabba kept numerous [[Slavery|enslaved]] dancers<ref name=\"Visual Encyclopedia\">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref> at [[Jabba's Palace|his palace]] in the [[Dune Sea]]. Yarna became one of the dancing girls,<ref name=\"DB Yarna\" /> and although she hated the Hutt, she became close to some of his palace regulars<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> and knew how to avoid Jabba's temper. Considering her to be his favorite performer,<ref name=\"Absolutely Everything\">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> one of Jabba's whims was forcing her to wear makeup to look more like [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's mother|his mother]], and her increased size was meant to resemble a Hutt's. Her slow and deliberate dances contrasted with those of the young [[Twi'lek]] [[Oola]].<ref name=\"DB Yarna\" /> She was present when Oola resisted the Hutt and was fed to his rancor, and for [[Luke Skywalker]]'s arrival to rescue his friend [[Han Solo]], but Yarna was not brought along on the [[sail barge]] when it went to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]]. The Hutt had captured [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], but she used her chain to strangle the Hutt to [[death]].<ref name=\"RotJ\" /> Thanks to Organa's actions, Yarna escaped Jabba's palace and was reunited with her cublings.<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYarna d'al' Gargan was portrayed by [[Claire Davenport]] in the [[1983]] [[original trilogy]] film, [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']].<ref name=\"RotJ\" /> Director [[Richard Marquand]] cast her after having directed her in [[Wikipedia:Birth of the Beatles|''Birth of the Beatles'']], a [[1979]] biopic about [[Wikipedia:The Beatles|The Beatles]], in which Davenport played a nude model. Marquand said, \"I selected the fat lady, because I think fat ladies are wonderful.\" He originally envisioned the character as a daughter to Jabba the Hutt.<ref name=\"Making\">[[The Making of Return of the Jedi]]</ref>\n\n[[Nilo Rodis-Jamero]], costume designer of ''Return of the Jedi'', said that Yarna d'al' Gargan's six breasts were decided upon in a conversation while under the influence of alcohol. Her costume used a [[Wikipedia:Foam latex|foam latex]] [[Wikipedia:Prosthetic makeup|prosthetic]] on her stomach,<ref name=\"Insider 158\">{{InsiderCite|158|Star Wars Style: Return of the Jedi, Part 6}}</ref> which was fabricated by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and shipped to London for filming.<ref name=\"Wiebba-Wiebba\" />\n\nThe character was not named Yarna d'al' Gargan during the production of ''Return of the Jedi''. In [[2006]], [[Holocron continuity database]] keeper [[Leland Chee]] identified a production name \"[[Weeba Weeba]]\" as assigned to a human rancor keeper.<ref name=\"Holocron\">{{Blog|holocron|27/comments|Jabba's Skiff Guards|Keeper of the Holocron's Blog|Leland Chee|archivedate=20120504152912}}</ref> However, research by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] for a [[StarWars.com]] blog post in [[2013]] uncovered that during production of ''Return of the Jedi'', Davenport's character was known as Wiebba-Wiebba.<ref name=\"Wiebba-Wiebba\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-mysteries-who-is-wiebba-wiebba|text=''Star Wars'' Mysteries: Who is Wiebba-Wiebba?|int=Star Wars Mysteries}}</ref>\n\nAfter the film, [[Kenner Products]] began designing an action figure of Gargan for the toy line [[Star Wars: The Power of the Force (1985 toy line)|''Star Wars: The Power of the Force'']]. [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] put a stop to production in its intermediate prototype stage, apparently considering the six-breasted dancer inappropriate for a children's toy.<ref name=\"Insider 92\">{{InsiderCite|92|The Toys That Never Were}}</ref> Her first action figure was released in [[2008]] as part of [[Hasbro Inc.|Hasbro's]] ''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Collection]]''.<ref name=\"Hasbro\">{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Legacy Collection|pack=Yarna D'al' Gargan|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/TLC06Yarna.asp|archivedate=20201111225358}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Bounty Hunt]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Original Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''\n*[[War of the Bounty Hunters &ndash; Jabba the Hutt 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters &ndash; Jabba the Hutt'' 1]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|158|Star Wars Style: Return of the Jedi, Part 6}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|36|Weapons & Uniforms|Jabba's Courtiers}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Alien Archive]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|58|Databank A-Z|Tusken Raiders&ndash;Captain Typho}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars Search and Find Volume I]]''\n*''[[Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian: Making of Season Two]]''\n*{{TOMCite|101|Database|Before the dark times&hellip;}}\n*''[[Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian: Making of the Season 2 Finale]]''\n*{{Databank|yarna-d-al-gargan|Yarna d'al' Gargan|archivedate=20150902090139}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30e4\u30fc\u30ca\u30fb\u30c0\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Gargan, Yarna d'al'}}\n[[Category:Askajians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jabba's dancers]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
