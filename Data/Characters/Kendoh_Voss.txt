Seeking to restore her family's fortunes, Voss became a criminal, leading the [[Kendoh Gang]], a crew of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] that included the [[Clawdite]] [[Changeling|shapeshifter]] [[Remex Io]] and the [[Aqualish]] [[Wooro]].\n\nDuring the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]], Voss encountered the Resistance operative [[Finn]], intending to take out the [[bounty]] placed on him by the First Order. The crew [[Mission to the moon of Avedot|tracked]] Finn to the [[moon of Avedot]], and almost managed to successfully capture him, but their target escaped with the help of fellow Resistance member [[Poe Dameron]].\n\nIn the wake of their failure, Voss and her crew [[Thief|stole]] the blade of the ancient [[Sith artifact]] known as the [[Sword of Khashyun]]. After acquiring the blade, they were hired to [[Thief|steal]] the hilt of the weapon from the [[collector]] [[Dok-Ondar]] in [[Black Spire Outpost]] on the [[planet]] [[Batuu]]. However, Dok-Ondar was the contact who had hired Voss, knowing that she possessed the blade of the [[sword]]. When Voss and her crew executed their heist, the First Order's [[709th Legion]] interfered, leading to a [[Battle of Batuu|skirmish]] in Dok-Ondar's [[Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities|antiquities store]]. Voss escaped both the First Order and Dok-Ondar, believing she had stolen the hilt, but discovered that the collector had tricked her, and had taken the blade for himself. As the First Order attempted to pursue them, Voss and her crew escaped Batuu with their lives and the [[credit]]s Dok-Ondar had given them as compensation.\n\n==Biography==\n===Criminal career===\n{{Quote|Isn't that right, Kendoh&mdash;or should I say, the Scourge of Serenno, the Thief of Tandhor-Six, the mastermind behind the Bothan Museum heist?|A First Order stormtrooper sergeant, to Kendoh Voss|Galaxy's Edge 5}}\nHailing from [[Serenno]], Voss's family lost their fortunes, leading [[Gender|her]] to become a [[mercenary]]<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 2\" /> and [[bounty hunter]].<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref> She led a notorious crew of criminals known as the [[Kendoh Gang]], which consisted of the [[Clawdite]] [[Changeling|shapeshifter]] [[Remex Io]], the [[Aqualish]] [[Wooro]],<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 1\" /> and the [[Utai]] warrior [[Basso Mak]].<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\" /> During her career, she became known for various acts, nicknamed the \"Scourge of Serenno\" and the \"[[Thief]] of [[Tandhor-Six]].\" She allegedly planned and carried out a [[Bothan Museum heist|heist]] in a [[Bothan]] [[museum]], but later claimed that the culprit had never officially been found.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\">[[Galaxy's Edge 5|''Galaxy's Edge'' 5]]</ref>\n\n===A disastrous mission===\n====Chasing a bounty====\n{{Quote|It's him.

Therefore ''Star Wars: Allegiance'' takes place in 34 [[Galactic standard calendar|ABY]] as well.</ref> during the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]], Voss and her gang visited the [[Wayward Comet]] [[Fuel|refueling]] [[Space station|station]]. While in a [[cantina]], Io spotted the Resistance operative [[Finn]], who Voss was aware had a large [[bounty]] placed on him by the First Order. Io contacted Voss, who told him to follow Finn back to his [[Starship|ship]] and place a [[Homing beacon|tracker]] on it. Voss contacted a [[lieutenant]] of the First Order, requesting to claim the bounty on Finn's head. After conferring with [[General]] [[Armitage Hux|Hux]], who was pushed into chasing the sighting by [[Supreme Leader]] [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]], the lieutenant was ordered to authorize a down payment on the bounty and inform Voss of the consequences of their failure.<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\" />\n\nVoss tracked Finn to the [[moon of Avedot]], where he and [[Poe Dameron]] were attempting to retrieve confiscated weapons from the abandoned [[New Republic]] impound [[Base 354-23X]]. Mak landed the crew's starship in the [[mountain]]s of the [[moon]], avoiding detection, and Voss headed for the base along with Io and Wooro. Wooro [[Death|killed]] the Resistance operative [[Tonkins]], who Io impersonated in order to get closer to Finn. When Io revealed himself prematurely, shooting down another Resistance member, Voss stepped forward to assist him, taking down a third operative with a throwing [[knife]]. Finn managed to escape, regrouping with Dameron, but the crew had successfully blocked their only exit, leaving the Resistance operatives trapped.<ref name=\"Allegiance 2\">[[Allegiance 2|''Allegiance'' 2]]</ref>\n\n====The mission goes wrong====\n{{Quote|Kendoh, it doesn't look like Basso Mak was listening when you mentioned the Resistance leaders were worth more alive!''\"<br>\"''Just evacuate now!

Wooro cut through the door with a [[laser]], and he and Voss entered the room while Io guarded the exit. Voss and Wooro failed to notice Dameron and his [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]] hiding in the room, and Finn managed to escape through a vent, running into Io. Voss went to investigate the disturbance, and found Io fighting with Finn. When Wooro went to shoot Finn, Voss warned the Aqualish to [[stun]] rather than kill. Wooro missed, stunning Io, and Voss reprimanded him for allowing Finn to get away. Mak, who was waiting in the crew's starship, was tricked into investigating lights on the far side of the outpost by Dameron, despite Voss ordering him to keep watch over the Resistance ship. While Dameron loaded the weapons aboard their ship, Finn incapacitated Wooro with a [[harpoon gun]].<ref name=\"Allegiance 3\">[[Allegiance 3|''Allegiance'' 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Kendoh_explosion.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Kendoh Voss dives away from a thermal detonator on the moon of Avedot.]]\nVoss approached Dameron, intending to hand the [[Resistance pilot]] over to the First Order and collect the bounties on both him and Finn. However, BB-8 bumped a crate of [[thermal detonator]]s, sending one rolling towards Voss. Voss dived aside to avoid the explosion, giving Dameron the chance to escape in his ship. Upon learning that the explosion had triggered the remaining cache of weapons, Voss contacted the rest of her crew, ordering them to evacuate from the base. She reprimanded Mak for moving from their post, but the Utai was killed when Finn crashed an impounded [[airspeeder]] into the Kendoh Gang's ship. Finn and Dameron managed to escape the moon, leaving the bounty hunters and the wreckage of their ship behind. Voss was unperturbed, however; Mak's death left the rest of the crew enough [[Foodstuff|rations]] to survive long enough so that they could repair their ship.<ref name=\"Allegiance 4\">[[Allegiance 4|''Allegiance'' 4]]</ref> Due to their failure, Voss and her gang were wary of crossing paths with the First Order.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 2\" />\n\n===The heist of a lifetime===\n====Arrival on Batuu====\n{{Quote|This score will earn us enough so that I can return to Serenno and restore my family's fortunes.

Voss hoped that the job would bring her enough [[credit]]s to return to her [[homeworld]] and restore the status of her family.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 2\" /> Unbeknownst to Voss, the contact who hired her was Dok-Ondar himself, who had heard that she possessed the blade and wished to acquire both halves of the artifact before Voss could sell it.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\" />\n\n[[File:Kendoh_and_crew.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kendoh Voss and her crew inspect the artifact while spying on Dok-Ondar.]]\nOn Batuu, Voss met with Wooro and Io whilst the First Order's [[709th Legion]] patrolled Black Spire Outpost. The crew visited [[Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities]] to have an audience with the collector, where Voss requested a purchase that Dok-Ondar refused. With the collector distracted, Io planted a [[cam droid]]. The crew were thrown out of the store, but Voss was satisfied, with Dok-Ondar having fallen for their bait.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 1\" />\n\nInside their starship, Voss and her crew watched footage from the cam [[droid]] of Dok-Ondar speaking with a [[Unidentified First Order stormtrooper sergeant|sergeant]] of the Red Fury. The [[sergeant]] was forced to leave when Wooro engineered a distraction by causing a disturbance in the outpost's marketplace. The crew watched as Dok-Ondar, paranoid that the First Order would discover the Sith artifact, checked on it and planned to move it to a safer location. Voss recognized the artifact as their target, planning to steal it before Dok-Ondar could hide it elsewhere.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 2\" />\n\n====Advancing the plan====\n{{Quote|Our mysterious patron isn't going to pay the full amount unless we have both pieces. We move forward with the heist tonight.|Kendoh Voss, to her crew|Galaxy's Edge 4}}\nVoss and her crew met in [[Oga's Cantina]], where Io arrived late, having had run-ins with both First Order [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] and Dok-Ondar's enforcer [[Varg]]. While Io,<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 3\">[[Galaxy's Edge 3|''Galaxy's Edge'' 3]]</ref> who was actually being impersonated by Varg,<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\" /> seemed discouraged about their success in the heist, Voss continued with her plan, meeting with a supposed fortune-teller. Voss, however, saw through the fortune-teller's act, aware that she was a front to screen potential customers for [[Ohnaka Transport Solutions]], ran by the [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Voss spoke with Ohnaka, claiming she needed him to transport the Sword of Khashyun through the First Order [[blockade]], citing his renown as a pirate. She was unaware that Ohnaka was working for Dok-Ondar, who was listening in on their conversation. Voss was forced to wait as Ohnaka recounted one of his adventures before she was asked what she was transporting. Voss told him, and seeing Ohnaka's reaction, she questioned where he knew of the sword, to which Ohnaka replied that he had heard of the sword from a mission undertaken by [[Chelli Lona Aphra]]. <ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 3\" />\n\n[[File:KendohCrew-GE4.png|thumb|right|280px|Voss and her crew begin their heist, unaware that Varg is impersonating Io.]]\nOhnaka returned to Dok-Ondar, informing him of Voss's plot, but she and her crew were watching them through a [[cam droid]]. As Voss had hoped, Dok-Ondar insisted on moving the artifact into a safe location, and she left to prepare the heist. She and Wooro entered the collector's store, having disabled the [[security droid]] outside. When Voss confronted Dok-Ondar, however, the collector revealed that the droid she had destroyed was not his primary security droid, sending the [[IG-series]] [[assassin droid]] [[BK-86]] forward. As BK-86 approached Voss, \"Io\" contacted her on an emergency channel, informing her that First Order stormtroopers were gathered outside the antiquities store.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 4\" />\n\n====The truth revealed====\n{{Quote|Why are we here? To execute an intricately plotted heist, of course. And when that plan falls apart&hellip;improvise.|Kendoh Voss|Galaxy's Edge 5}}\nThe stormtroopers entered the store, and their sergeant confronted Voss, who disregarded his threats. Dok-Ondar warned Voss not to antagonize the sergeant, who ordered [[RS-2112|one]] of his [[trooper]]s to strike Wooro with a [[Z6 riot control baton|baton]]. Voss rushed to protect her accomplice, and the sergeant once again threatened her. When Voss continued to ignore the intimidation, the sergeant struck her across the face with his [[blaster]]. Dok-Ondar warned Voss not to make any moves, and the sergeant questioned her on why her crew was on Batuu.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\" />\n\n[[File:Release_the_sarlacc.jpg|thumb|left|310px|Kendoh Voss releases the sarlacc in Dok-Ondar's store.]]\nVoss, who recalled overhearing Dok-Ondar tell tales about the artifacts in his store, chose to improvise a new plan, grabbing the box that held the hilt and running, using a [[Unidentified statue (Jedha)|kyber statue]] that the collector had taken from [[Jedha]] to deflect the troopers' blaster bolts. She threw the hilt to Wooro, who made an escape, using the box to knock several stormtroopers aside. Cornered by the troopers, Voss used [[Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber|a lightsaber]] to break open the tank containing Dok-Ondar's baby [[sarlacc]], which proceeded to attack the stormtroopers.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\" />\n\nAs the stormtroopers attempted to fend off the sarlacc, Voss escaped from the antiquities store, and the sergeant attempted to give chase, but Voss evaded his pursuit, losing him in the streets of Batuu. However, when she returned to her ship, Voss discovered Io, who revealed that Varg had been impersonating him, and had stolen the blade of the sword. Through a [[hologram]] [[Holoprojector|projected]] from a floating droid, Dok-Ondar spoke to Voss, disclosing that he had been the crew's anonymous benefactor in order to retrieve the other half of the sword. Inside the box that had supposedly contained the hilt, Voss found a number of [[credit]]s, while Dok-Ondar informed her that he had revealed her ship's location to the First Order. With no choice but to accept their losses and leave with what they had, Voss and her crew escaped in their ship, leaving Batuu behind.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|Careful&hellip;you're antagonizing a dangerous man.''&raquo;<br>&laquo;He'' should be worried about antagonizing me.|Dok-Ondar and Kendoh Voss|Galaxy's Edge 5}}\n[[File:Kendoh_antagonize.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Voss was unafraid to anger the First Order sergeant that confronted her.]]\nAs the leader of a mercenary crew, Kendoh Voss strove to keep up the reputation of both herself and her crew.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 1\" /> She was loyal to the members of her crew, rushing to defend them when they were threatened.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\" /> However, when one member of her crew, Basso Mak, was killed while refusing to follow her orders, Voss was unfazed, instead focusing on the survival of the rest of her crew.<ref name=\"Allegiance 4\" />\n\nThe pirate Hondo Ohnaka described Voss as notorious, a description which she was both aware of and content with.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 4\" /> Her true motive for her criminal actions was to restore the fortunes of her family on Serenno, and she wished to achieve her goal and return to a life without danger.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 2\" /> While Voss had no issue with taking the First Order bounty on a member of the Resistance, prioritizing monetary reward over conscience,<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\" /> she was also unafraid to defy the First Order.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 5\" /> Voss preferred to bring in her targets alive to collect the full bounty, but was satisfied with the potential reward for taking Finn to the First Order dead.<ref name=\"Allegiance 3\" />\n\nVoss was confident in her plan to steal the hilt of the Sword of Khashyun, having no doubt about its chance of success.
