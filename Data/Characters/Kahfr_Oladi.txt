Cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Oladi resided in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] where she created two works of art, titled ''[[Mon Calamari Eye 1]]'' and ''[[Mon Calamari Eye 2]]''. Both of these [[Painting/Legends|paintings]] were subsequently featured in the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]] by curator [[Lilas Dinhint]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Where should I look for Kahfr Oladi?\"<br />\"Try Mos Eisley to find Kahfr Oladi.

While there, she created two [[Painting/Legends|paintings]], one titled ''[[Mon Calamari Eye 1]]'', and another titled ''[[Mon Calamari Eye 2]]'', both of which depicted a closeup of a [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari's]] [[Eye/Legends|eye]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], curator [[Lilas Dinhint]] oversaw the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> which served as the planet's only [[Museum/Legends|museum]].<ref name=\"Eisley\">''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''</ref> Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Kahfr Oladi was one of the artists to be considered, along with [[Vanvi Hotne]], [[Giaal Itotr]], [[Klepa Laeel]], [[Boulo Siesi]], and [[Kolka Zteht/Legends|Kolka Zteht]]. In order to have her paintings featured in Bestine, however, Oladi required enough votes to win over her fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty [[Standard day/Legends|days]], allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the course of her artistry career, Oladi was approached by a number of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], many of whom voted for her as their artist of choice. Oladi won the art competitions at various times, allowing her the opportunity to display her paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time her paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. This allowed the opportunity for [[Architect/Legends|architecturally-inclined]] furniture makers and [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] to mass-produce copies of Oladi's paintings so that they could be purchased, [[Collector/Legends|collected]], or displayed for personal use.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Mon-calamari-eye-1.jpg|150px|thumb|''Mon Calamari Eye 1'']]\n{{Quote|Kahfr is a great artist!

A conceited individual, Oladi always referred to herself in the third person. She believed herself to be a great artist, and felt that the honor of having her artwork displayed in Bestine was well deserved, and long overdue. She considered herself to be a busy individual, and did not appreciate being bothered by passersby.
