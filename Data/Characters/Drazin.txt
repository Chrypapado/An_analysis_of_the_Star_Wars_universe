Who are you?|Drazin, before shooting [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]]|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\n'''Drazin''' was a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] [[Corporal/Legends|corporal]] assigned to [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Igar/Legends|Igar's]] honor guard by the year [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]. He, alongside the stormtrooper [[Gamma Squad (Imperial)|Gamma Squad]], accompanied [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] [[Occupation of Bespin|took control]] of [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]] with the goal of capturing [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. There in a back room he shot [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]]&mdash;who inadvertently discovered the Imperial forces&mdash;in order to prevent the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] from blowing the cover of him and his teammates, following the standard Imperial procedure of shooting first and asking questions later. A year later, Drazin was assigned to [[Tempest Force]] and participated in the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].\n\n==Biography==\nDrazin was born on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], over the gas giant of [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]].

While there, he was seated in a room that [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], Luke's [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], entered. Drazin ordered the droid to stand still and rose from his chair, before blasting the droid.<ref name=\"topps\" />\n\nAfterwards, Drazin became a member of [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Igar/Legends|Igar's]] personal honor guard,<ref name=\"CCG\" /> and with that, [[Tempest Force]]. It was an elite formation of [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]], [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], and Stormtrooper Corps units that was tasked with guarding the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield generator bunker]] on the forest moon of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]].
