Your fiance\u00e9, Mia&mdash;your family&mdash;''\"<br />\"''Mia was my sister. My fiance\u00e9 was named ''Nyiestra''.<!-- \"fianc\u00e9e\" is misspelled in the original source -->|[[Winter Celchu|Winter]] and [[Tycho Celchu]]|X-Wing Rogue Squadron 9}}\n'''Nyiestra''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] and the fianc\u00e9e of [[Tycho Celchu]]. She perished in the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of her [[Homeworld/Legends|home planet]].\n\n==Biography==\nGrowing up on the pacifistic [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], Nyiestra knew [[Tycho Celchu]] through her entire childhood, and the two became close friends. By the time they reached adolescence, he was certain he wanted to marry her, and she reciprocated his love. They spent as much time as possible together, eager to enjoy each other's company.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" /> Celchu proposed as soon as he was of age, and Nyiestra agreed to both marry him and wait until he had graduated from the [[Imperial Naval Academy|Imperial Academy]], made it through his first year as a [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], and been moved into fleet operations where his life would be secure enough professionally to begin a family.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" /><ref>[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 9|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 9]]</ref> Celchu was tremendously certain in his relationship with Nyiestra, sure that she provided an unshakable future for him.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\nHowever, Nyiestra died in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] when the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] Alderaan and, in so doing, eliminated that certain future. Celchu was traumatized, throwing himself into battle against the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] that had taken his family and fianc\u00e9e from him, dedicating himself to making sure no one else suffered their fate. However, in so doing, Celchu became a hardened warrior, someone the pacifistic Nyiestra would not have understood. He realized that, by taking the action he felt was necessary and opposing the Empire, he had become someone fundamentally unsuitable for Nyiestra&mdash;a loss which cut him deeply, though he accepted it as inevitable.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 3|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 3]] {{Imo}} {{1stm}}\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 9|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 9]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|Under ''Tycho Celchu''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
