A [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] affiliated with the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority]], Lind was investigated by agents of the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nA pirate operating on Saleucami during the reign of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Graf Lind was associated with the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority]] until he was cast out from their group for unknown reasons. Around this time, Lind lost his right leg to the Sorority, cobbling together a cheap prosthetic leg and walking with a polished [[bubse]] wood cane which contained a [[vibrorapier]]. Living in the city of [[Taleucema]], Lind's residence in the overcrowded slum called the Warren had a single room and showed signs of decades of wear. Gaining the protection of a local street gang, as denoted by a single black X on the door, Lind maintained a simple routine which consisted of running errands at noon, and returning with food and [[rotgut]]. When the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium]] became suspicious of Lind's connection to the Sorority when the Consortium's ships began losing cargo to pirates, a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] was sent to investigate him.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Mask of the Pirate Queen]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lind, Graf}}\n[[Category:Cyborgs with prosthetics]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Individuals with lost limbs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Saleucamians]]\n[[Category:Veiled Sorority members]]"}}}]}}}}
