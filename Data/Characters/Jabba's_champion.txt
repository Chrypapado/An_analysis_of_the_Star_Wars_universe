Jabba used it to get rid of undesirable individuals.<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game}}\nIn 32 BBY, shortly before the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing/Legends|Podrace]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], whose ship had been stranded on Tatooine, was searching for a source of [[Peggat/Legends|peggats]] to make a bet with junk dealer [[Watto/Legends|Watto]]. Jabba, who was looking for amusement, lured Jinn to the arena, and promised to give the needed money to him if the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] could defeat his champion. With no other options left, Jinn agreed.<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n[[File:Qui-GonChamp.jpg|thumb|left|Qui-Gon Jinn faces Jabba's champion]]\n\nOn Jabba's signal, the champion emerged from its room, roaring with rage, and immediately attacked the Jedi Master. However, the beast proved no match for Jinn, who used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force push|push]] the champion against the spiked walls of the pit and overcame the monster with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. The beast was soon defeated and, shouting its last cry, fell lifeless to the ground.<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n\nAfter the battle, Jabba thanked Jinn for the entertaining duel, gave him the peggats he needed, and released him. Because of the combat skills he had shown against the champion, Jinn was under the admiration and respect of Jabba and his [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|criminal empire]].<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJabba's champion was a beast-like creature, and didn't show any kind of humanity or compassion towards its victims. It was savagely violent, and continued to beat its victims even after killing them. It wasn't able to intelligently communicate, and could only babble with primitive voices such as howling and growling. In battle, it was resolute, not giving up the fight even when seriously injured.<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|The Preponderant Jabba is impressed by your skill and cunning. He thanks you for providing such worthy entertainment.|Jabba's Interpreter to Qui-Gon Jinn after the battle|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)}}\nThe predator was a powerful creature, which awarded it with the title of champion. It had a large belt, which was ornate with three skulls, presumably remains of its former victims. In battle, it used mostly its burly fists to strike its enemies down. When in Jabba's arena, it often cropped spikes from the wall, which it then used as a [[Dagger/Legends|dagger]]. Alternately, the champion could throw the spikes at its victims with great accuracy. It was also robust, being able to live in a room which was crowded with pointed spikes and withstand even the hits from a lightsaber for a while. However, the creature was not fast enough to defeat a Jedi Master such as Qui-Gon Jinn, who avoided and blocked the champion's strikes and ultimately defeated it.<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n[[File:DeathofChamp.jpg|thumb|right|The death of Jabba's champion at the hands of Jinn]]\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDue to an in-game bug, it is possible that if the champion managed to kill Qui-Gon, it remains too close to the spikes and gets itself killed. Even though Jinn is already dead, Jabba will speak like he is still alive, thanking the Jedi for the fight.<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n\nIt is possible that Qui-Gon managed to acquire a blaster before his confrontation with the champion, and defeated it by staying out of its reach and wearing it down with repeated blaster fire, though this would be inconsistent with his portrayal in the movie and other sources.<ref name=\"TPMvg\" />\n\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Jabba's Champion}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jabbas Champion\n}}\n\n[[Category:Gladiators]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
