Harburiks's first mission. As in many of the game's old quests, the NPC's gender, species and appearance is dynamically generated from a wide variety of possible appearances every time it is spawned. Only his gender and species are known as they are specifically mentioned by Harburik.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dinard, Wend}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
