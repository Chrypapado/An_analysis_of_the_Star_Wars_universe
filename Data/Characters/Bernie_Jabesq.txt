A posed promotional picture of the character appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide]]''&mdash;an interactive encyclopedia on CD-ROM released by [[LucasArts]]&mdash;but his name was not explicitely mentioned.<ref name=\"E1:IG\" />\n\n[[File:Bernie_action_figure.png|thumb|left|155px|The \"Naboo Soldier\" action figure]]\nDespite being a character of very minor importance, the engineer was made into an action figure of the toy line ''[[Star Wars: The Saga Collection]]'' in [[2006]]. Although it was erroneously labeled as a \"Naboo Soldier,\" the figure had the distinctive markings of Bernie on the helmet.<ref name=\"toy\" />\n\nThe character's name long remained unknown, since the transliteration of Naboo futhork had not been revealed. In [[2008]], the first official mapping of the futhork alphabet appeared in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'',<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|I|299|Futhork}}</ref> which allowed to decipher the letters on the helmet.
