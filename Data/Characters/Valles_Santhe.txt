[[99 BBY/Legends|99 BBY]]. Sienar Technologies was renamed [[Santhe/Sienar Technologies]] and Republic Sienar Systems eventually became [[Sienar Fleet Systems/Legends|Sienar Fleet Systems]], manufacturer of the [[TIE Series]] of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] fighters.\n\nLady Santhe was a small woman with black hair and flashing dark eyes whose presence commanded an unmistakable air of authority. She was an arrogant woman who was used to almost unlimited wealth and power. Her companies factories employed a large percentage of the population of [[Lianna/Legends|Lianna]]. She openly supported the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] but in reality she was a firm believer in Liann independence and did not particularly care for the Empire or the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].\n\nWhen Santhe/Sienar Technologies received an Imperial defense contract (Codename [[NOVA]]) to develop an improvement of the [[Energy Emittance Baffler]], a key component of a [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]], the [[Imperial Advisor]] [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Rodin Hlian Verpalion]] was assigned to oversee the project. Valles treated Lord Verpalion with caution but secretly hated him. She manipulated his visits carefully so as to ensure good reports to [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]].\n\nFollowing the Emperor's death she was able to attain a degree of independence for her homeworld, despite the pro-Imperial attempts of Lord Verpalion. When the CEO of Santhe/Sienar Technologies, [[Raith Sienar/Legends|Raith Sienar]], was assassinated Lady Santhe took direct control of the company. She created [[Sienar Army Systems]] which manufactured the [[Century tank]] and other ground vehicles for the Empire under the Reborn Emperor. However, she also used the weapons as a threat to prevent an Imperial occupation of Lianna by [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Gronn]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Hnn|51|business/13411_1.html|Successful Engine Tests Cause Sienar Stock Surge|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728124624/http://www.holonetnews.com/51/business/13411_1.html}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Mission to Lianna]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Star Wars Miniatures Battles Companion]]''\n*''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Chief Executive Officer/Legends|CEO]] of [[Santhe/Sienar Technologies]]\n|years=?
