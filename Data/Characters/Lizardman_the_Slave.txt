What I would give for a more intelligent slave.|Charal|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Lizardman the Slave''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] who ended up stranded on the [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon]] of [[Endor (planet)/Legends|Endor]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. By the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Lizardman was working as a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] for [[Charal]], a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-wielding]] [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] from [[Dathomir]] who also ended up stranded on the [[Forest/Legends|Forest]] [[Moon/Legends|Moon]]. During their confinement on the small moon, the dimwitted Lizardman used his keen sense of smell to help find [[Plant/Legends|herbs]] for a [[Charal's divinatory poultice|divinatory poultice]] Charal was concocting. When Lizardman got lost in the woods, Charal tasked a servant of hers with finding the wayward Trandoshan and returning him safely to [[Terak's Keep]], home of the [[Sanyassan Marauders]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|You should be able to find him out within the forests. Do not be afraid when you gaze upon him, he is a Lizard man that was stranded here as well. Tell him to follow you back here.|Charal, to her latest servant|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] ended up stranded on the [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon]] of [[Endor (planet)/Legends|Endor]]. Meanwhile, a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-wielding]] [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] hailing from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dathomir]] also ended up stranded on the [[Forest/Legends|Forest]] [[Moon/Legends|Moon]]. By the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Charal kept the stranded Trandoshan as a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]], earning him the moniker of \"Lizardman the Slave.\" Dimwitted, but with a keen sense of smell, Charal sent Lizardman on a mission to gather a certain type of [[Plant/Legends|herb]] which grew within the forests of the small moon. The leaves were to serve as one of the main ingredients for a [[Charal's divinatory poultice|poultice]] Charal was concocting, a potion which would have the power to [[Force vision/Legends|divine the future]]. Unfortunately for Charal, her plans were delayed when the foolish Trandoshan ended up getting lost in the woods. In the meantime, Charal bided her time at [[Terak's Keep]], a stronghold belonging to the [[Sanyassan Marauders|Marauders]], a band of [[Sanyassan]] [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] led by [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nLuckily for Charal, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] happened upon the stronghold and ended up becoming a servant for the [[Witch-Queen]]. After having acquired an [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[spleen]] for her poultice, Charal sent her newly acquired servant deep into the forests of Endor to find the wayward Lizardman and bring him back safely to Terak's Keep. Out in the woods, Lizardman was finally discovered by Charal's newest servant, and willingly followed the individual home to his master. Lizardman's extended absence was not a complete misadventure. He had on him the leaves needed for Charal's poultice, and promptly handed them over to her. After obtaining a third ingredient in the form of Ewok spit, Charal was finally able to complete her poultice, and envisioned a future where many [[Starship/Legends|starships]] would arrive to the moon, thus allowing her to steal one and secure passage back to her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Charal-SWG.jpg|200px|thumb|Nightsister Charal, master of Lizardman the Slave]]\n{{Quote|Why you talk better than other slaves? OW!!! Head hurrrrrt..... just take me back.|Lizardman the Slave|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nLizardman the Slave had green skin and [[Gold/Legends|gold]] [[Color/Legends|colored]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Considered by Charal to be \"dumb,\" the Nightsister Witch-Queen nevertheless valued Lizardman for his keen sense of smell, which proved useful for finding the necessary herbs for her poultice. However, the slave's lack of intelligence rendered him unable to find his way back home after getting lost in the woods of the Forest Moon. The Trandoshan's lack of intellect was also evidenced by the simplistic manner in which he spoke [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]]. When being rescued by a servant of Charal's, Lizardman expressed surprise that the \"slave\" could speak the [[Language/Legends|language]] so fluently.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|Yes, there you are Lizardman... you have stayed out for far too long.
