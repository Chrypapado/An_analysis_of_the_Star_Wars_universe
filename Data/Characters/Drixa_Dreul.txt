Sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who was working for [[Dyxle Pedette]]'s [[Tasty Dried Critters]] came by her house to deliver an order of fast food. When the spacer got there, Drixa found out that the [[fungus dippers]] that she ordered were not there. She complained to the spacer that the spacer and Dyxle messed up her order, then sent the bill to Dyxle, minus the cost of the fungus dippers.<ref name=\"SWG:TDC\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Byxle Pedette}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dreul, Drixa}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
