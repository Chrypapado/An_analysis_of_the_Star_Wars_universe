Serving as a [[Vigo/Legends|Vigo]] for decades, Garyn eventually attained the rank of [[Underlord]], the highest position in the organization. Leading the Vigos in the years before the return of the [[Order of the Sith Lords]] during the last decades of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Garyn saw the syndicate grow to great strength during his reign. Garyn and the rest of the Black Sun leadership were brutally slaughtered during an [[First Mission to Ralltiir|attack]] by the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith]] [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]] in [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] born on [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]], Alexi Garyn was not identified by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] at an early enough age, resulting in him being passed over by the Order as he was too old to begin the [[Jedi training/Legends|training]]. His dream of joining the ranks of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] diminished, Garyn decided to develop his talents in a different way, turning to crime and becoming a member of the crime syndicate [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]].<ref name=\"DM4\" />\n\nBy the year [[76 BBY/Legends|76 BBY]], the Vigos of Black Sun were already preparing young Garyn to take control of the organization; having already attained the rank of Vigo himself, it would only be a matter of years before he won the position from his competition, such as Boss [[Cabra]]. Despite some conflict between [[Damask Holdings/Legends|Damask Holdings]] and their support for Boss Cabra, Garyn attained the position of Underlord which he had desired and began to make many friends among [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].<ref name=\"SWDP\">[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]</ref> Under his leadership, Black Sun built a reign of fear felt on every planet from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. Even with thousands of soldiers to execute his every order, Garyn kept himself in his [[Black Sun Fortress|fortress]] on Ralltiir surrounded by a cadre of elite guards. Under his direct command were the nine Vigos, his own personal bodyguard, an extremely skilled female warrior called [[Mighella]], and his trusted secretary [[Oolth]].<ref name=\"DM4\" />\n\n===Enemy of the Sith===\nDuring the reign of [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|King]] [[Ars Veruna/Legends|Ars Veruna]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], Garyn earned a seat at his royal table during a feast to drown out the applause outside [[Theed Royal Palace/Legends|Theed Palace]] for Veruna's competitor [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Naberrie]]; the feast coincided with the infamous [[Eriadu Trade Summit|Trade Summit]] on [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]]. Taking over the export of Naboo's rare [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]], Garyn supported Veruna's staunch opposition of [[Magister]] [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Hego Damask]], whom Garyn felt had betrayed the trust of the Vigos of Black Sun but who also threatened to usurp the possibility for the self-same lucrative [[plasma]]-export contract with Naboo.<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\nUnbeknownst to Garyn, Naboo's [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]\u2014who had (on his way to the Eriadu Summit) [[Eriadu Trade Summit#The Naboo stopover|stopped]] briefly to also attend the feast in Veruna's [[Throne room (Theed Royal Palace)/Legends|court]]\u2014was Darth Sidious, [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] of Magister Damask, the alter-ego of Darth Plagueis. In Palpatine's view, Garyn's presence at the feast marked him for death, as his [[Sith Master/Legends|dark master]] had viewed Garyn's relationship with Veruna as a clear signal of betrayal\u2014just as the Black Sun overlord's subsequent collusion in Veruna's catastrophic [[Sojourn#Nuclear target|nuclear attack]] on the [[Muun/Legends|Muun's]] fortress on [[Sojourn]] would irreversibly seal his fate. Although Sidious himself was the true mastermind behind the attack (which surprisingly [[Bombing of Sojourn|failed]] in its aim to assassinate Damask), he and his master agreed that the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] assassin [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]] (who himself, ''also ironically'', had originally [[Maul: Lockdown|secured]] the proscribed [[Nuclear bomb|nuclear device]]) should be sent to eliminate the Vigos and Garyn in swift retribution for their treacherous involvement\u2014an untraceable Sith attack that would effectively cripple the formidable crime syndicate for many years to come and make it exceedingly difficult for them to regroup. Plagueis and Sidious believed that Black Sun, as it existed, was too much of a threat and an unnecessary hindrance to the [[Grand Plan/Legends|Grand Plan]], to a swift Sith achievement of galactic conquest.<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\n[[File:TheDeathofAlexiGaryn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]] kills Alexi Garyn.]]\n\nOrdering Maul to hunt down two Vigos at first, Sidious anticipated that Garyn would detect the coming purge and order the surviving Vigos to his fortress on Ralltiir, believing they would be safe inside the impregnable castle. Following the deaths of Vigos [[Darnada]] and [[Morn]], Garyn did just that; bring all the remaining Vigos to one location. Fortifying the complex in hopes of killing the Zabrak assassin, the Vigos and Garyn were gathered when [[First Mission to Ralltiir|Maul arrived]], swiftly cutting through the bodyguards without suffering a single blow. As the Vigos attempted to escape, Garyn sealed them in the audience chamber while he, Mighella, and Oolth, escaped down a [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]]. As his Vigos met their deaths at the end of Maul's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Garyn attempted to reach his [[Alexi Garyn's yacht|yacht]] below the fortress but was caught by the assassin before boarding.<ref name=\"DM4\" />\n\nIgniting his crimson [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Maul attacked the [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] Mighella, who was able to identify him as a [[Nightbrothers/Legends|Nightbrother]] of [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]] before [[Sai tok/Legends|cutting her in half at the waist]].<ref name=\"DM4\" /><ref name=\"SWDP\" /> While Oolth fled, Maul focused on Garyn and prepared to kill the man. Revealing himself as a Sith, Maul was distracted by his own pride and arrogance, and Garyn managed to attack the Zabrak, drawing blood. Enraged, Maul grabbed Garyn by the throat and drove him under the water, drowning Garyn and leaving his lifeless body in the small reservoir.<ref name=\"DM4\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nFollowing the death of Garyn and the other Vigos, Black Sun spiraled out of control and all but collapsed, the few remaining members scattering over the next decade. Despite their apparent killing blow, Black Sun remained and several Vigos vied for power. An attempt to regulate [[bota]] with the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] failed and crippled the organization further. However, Black Sun would recover and emerge stronger then ever under the leadership of [[Underlord]] [[Dal Perhi]], with help from a [[Falleen/Legends|Falleen]] named [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]], during the reign of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"MF\">[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']]</ref> Despite this, surviving members of the organization's upper-tier who had served under Garyn would join together circa [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]] to form a group called the [[Garyn Raiders]]. Operating off of a base on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Rori/Legends|Rori]], the Raiders targeted Imperial ships, avenging their fallen leader by harassing the Sith-governed Empire.<ref>{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]\n*[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon (audiobook)|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2000) 2|''Darth Maul'' (2000) 2]] {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2000) 3|''Darth Maul'' (2000) 3]] {{1st}} {{1stID|Lex}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2000) 4|''Darth Maul'' (2000) 4]] {{1stID}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=End Game|book=Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|bformatted=''Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace'' novelization|manual=1}} {{C|[[2012]] edition}} {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'' novelization]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (unabridged audiobook)|''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[Scoundrels]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Scoundrels (audiobook)|''Scoundrels'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*{{FFCite|92|BLA1&ndash;3, ''Black Sun''}}\n*{{FFCite|126|CRI7, ''Crime Lords - Infernal Politics''}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=content.jsp?page=Star%20Wars%20Galaxies%20Most%20Wanted:%20Rori|text=Star Wars Galaxies Most Wanted: Rori|archivedate=20051016022152}} <!--  2005-04-05 -->\n*{{SonyCite|url=content.jsp?page=Star%20Wars%20Galaxies%20Most%20Wanted:%20Talus|text=Star Wars Galaxies Most Wanted: Talus|archivedate=20051016022432}} <!--  2005-04-05 -->\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/guides.vm?id=80112|text=[[CorSec Database A-G]]|archivedate=20111124001235}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|organization|blacksun|Black Sun|archivedate=20100318124917}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Underlord]] of [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]\n|years=&mdash;[[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]]\n|before=[[Salarr]]\n|before-years=&mdash;[[3643 BBY]]\n|after=Eventually [[Dal Perhi]]\n|after-years=[[29 BBY/Legends|29]]&ndash;[[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pt=Alexi Garyn\n|de=Alexi Garyn\n|es=Alexi Garyn\n|hu=Alexi Garyn\n|nl=Alexi Garyn\n|pl=Alexi Garyn\n|ru=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0413\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Garyn, Alexi}}\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ralltiiri]]\n[[Category:Vigos]]"}}}]}}}}
