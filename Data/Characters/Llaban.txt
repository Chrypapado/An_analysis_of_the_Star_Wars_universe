Here come the drop ships!|Llaban, before the Battle of Kirrek|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3}}\n'''Llaban''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native of [[Kirrek]], and leader of the [[Kirrek rebels|rebel forces]] that fought against [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta's]] military in the [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|Unification Wars]] of the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]]. Llaban's forces clashed with the Tetan military in [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]] in the [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|confrontation]] on Kirrek, and although the rebels were able to [[Siege|besiege]] the Tetans for over a month, Teta eventually seized victory due to the efforts of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]] and [[Memit Nadill]]. Later that same year, after the outbreak of the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]], Llaban was appointed by Teta, due to his desire for amnesty and his effort in the Unification Wars, to lead the fight against the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]] on Kirrek. Although chances of winning against the large [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] force seemed long at first, Llaban and his [[Army/Legends|army]] fought with resounding success and won the second [[Battle of Kirrek (Great Hyperspace War)|battle]] at Kirrek.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Empress, my rebels fought against you on Kirrek, but now we wish to join your military forces&hellip; for ''amnesty''!|Llaban|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3}}\nLlaban was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native of the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Kirrek]]. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], the [[Politics/Legends|political]] leader known as [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta]] launched a [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|campaign]] to unify the seven worlds of the Koros [[Star system/Legends|system]]. Llaban, not wanting Teta's dreams of Koros system unity to become a reality, led a makeshift [[Army/Legends|army]] of [[Kirrek rebels|rebels]] and [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] in opposition of Teta's forces on Kirrek.<ref name=\"encounter\" /> In the [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|Battle of Kirrek]], the concluding battle in the Koros Unification Wars, Llaban's rebels encircled and besieged Teta's forces in a citadel. The [[siege]] lasted a month, until the beleaguered Tetan [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] received assistance from [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Memit Nadill]] and [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]], who used the [[Force power/Legends|Force power]] of [[battle meditation]] to raise the spirits of the Tetan forces and lower the morale of Llaban's rebels. Although a desperate call for [[Autoturret/Legends|turret]] fire downed several Tetan supply [[Starship/Legends|ships]], Llaban and his rebels were defeated in the Battle of Kirrek.<ref name=\"conquest\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 0|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 0]]</ref>\n\nLater that same year, forces led by [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]], ruler of the long-isolated [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], invaded the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. The [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]], as it came to be known, was fought on two fronts; one at the Republic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and the other in the Koros system. With the battle for the Koros system about to begin, Llaban went to Empress Teta's palace in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]] on [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros Major]] and asked her if he and his rebels could fight against the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] in order to gain amnesty for their involvement in the rebellion. Although one of Teta's top [[Advisor/Legends|advisors]] and [[General/Legends|generals]], [[Vontaige]], was strongly opposed to this, Teta placed Llaban in charge of the defense of Kirrek. Also, Teta promised to recall [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] of war [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] to [[Ronika/Legends|Ronika]] to aid Llaban in Kirrek's defense. Alongside [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knight Odan-Urr and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Ooroo/Legends|Ooroo]], Llaban rounded up his old army of rebels and prepared them for battle with the Sith, reinforcing their positions with sharpened wooden stakes and trenches. The large Sith [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] appeared in the sky and launched [[Dropship/Legends|dropships]] containing [[Troop/Legends|troops]] to the surface. The [[Battle of Kirrek (Great Hyperspace War)|Battle of Kirrek]] had begun.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\nAlthough Llaban and his army fought hard against the Sith, the sheer size of the enemy force, which featured dozens of large [[Sith war behemoth]]s, seemed too overwhelming. Despite Odan-Urr's battle meditation, the Sith [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] warriors were able to break through their lines. With the Massassi pushing forward, Llaban ordered his soldiers to retreat. However, Ooroo at last entered the fray; a [[Celegian]], Ooroo lived in a container filled with the [[cyanogen]] gas that he breathed. As the cyanogen gas was poisonous to [[Oxygen/Legends|oxygen]] breathers, Ooroo poked several holes in his container, letting the winds blow the gas toward the Sith. This strategy was initially successful, but more invaders kept coming. Finally, ships carrying the reinforcements from Ronika arrived and gave Llaban and his army new hope for victory. The combination of the soldiers from Ronika and Ooroo's cyanogen gas spelled doom for the Sith, and the Battle of Kirrek was won.<ref name=\"dogs\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire 4|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 4]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Th- thank you, Empress!|Llaban|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3}}\nAlthough Llaban fought against Empress Teta in the Unification Wars, he was able to swallow his pride and appeal to her before the outbreak of the Great Hyperspace War. He was a capable leader, as shown by his gathering of a rebel army on Kirrek and his subsequent leading of that force with great success in both the Unification Wars and the Great Hyperspace War. Llaban willingly served Teta even after his defeat in the Unification Wars and was shocked and grateful for Teta's granting of prisoners from Ronika to bolster his forces. In battle, Llaban wore orange war paint on his face.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLlaban first appeared in [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire|''Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire'']], a story arc of the ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Kevin J.
