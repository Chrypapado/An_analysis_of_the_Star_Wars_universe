In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], she witnessed the climactic [[Duel on Cloud City/Legends|battle]] there between [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].\n\n==Biography==\nThe daughter of a [[Tibanna/Legends|tibanna]] gas refiner and an employee of the [[Holiday Towers]] restaurant, Jakien had befriended an [[Ugnaught/Legends|Ugnaught]] child and had learned from this companion the layout of the maze of Ugnaught tunnels beneath in the depths of the [[City/Legends|city]]. On the day that [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]] [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] ordered the evacuation of Cloud City, several friends and she submitted sick messages to school, and had chosen to play in the Ugnaught tunnels; when they heard the message, they turned to her for guidance. She led them toward her father in the gas refinery, but despite her experience, managed to get lost and encounter a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] squad.\n\nThe squad captured her friends, but Jakien managed to slip through their legs and enter a ventilation shaft. Now completely lost, she heard an unusual buzzing and, investigating, discovered two men fighting with [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]]. She followed the two at a distance as they fought, watching in amazement as [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|the larger, armored man]] used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to throw heavy objects at [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|his opponent]], knocking him through a viewport.\n\nWanting to learn what happened to the fallen hero, she found a shaft with a grating that looked into Cloud City's central wind tunnel. From there, she observed the continuation of the conflict, culminating in the armored man severing the hero's hand with his lightsaber. This brought her to tears, but she still listened to their words that echoed through the tunnel. She was shocked to hear that the armored man had killed the hero's father, but even more shocked when the armored man revealed the truth to the hero&mdash;that ''he'' was the hero's father. At this, the hero jumped, and Jakien lost sight of him; the armored man made a barely noticeable sigh, but then stopped in his tracks and looked directly at Jakien. Panicked, she fled upward, regardless of the threat that the stormtroopers might represent above.\n\nFortunately, upon arriving at the upper plaza, she ran into [[Bent Gavler]], a family friend, who consoled her sobbing and reunited her with her family. The Jakiens left Bespin on a crowded transport, and from its window she spotted a [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|light freighter]] fly past, which, for some reason, calmed her and reassured her that the hero had survived.\n\nEventually, Jakien was interviewed by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] historian [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]], who corroborated her story with other witnesses.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back|story=Little Girl Lost}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook|story=Little Girl Lost}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jakien, Allania}}\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
