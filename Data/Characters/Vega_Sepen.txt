At fifteen she stowed away aboard a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] vessel and secured her place in the crew by defeating the [[Nikto/Legends|Nikto]] first mate in a knife fight. Over the next few years, Sepen had moved from one fringe crew to another, and by [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]] she was a junior tactician aboard [[Urias Xhaxin]]'s [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]], the ''[[Free Lance]]''.\n\nWhen the ''Free Lance'' was attacked by the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], Sepen decided that the invaders had to be stopped, reasoning that the situation offered a stark choice between [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] or [[Death/Legends|death]] and fighting back. She joined the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] military&mdash;or attempted to&mdash;but she washed out quickly due to her inability to submit to military discipline, and she found herself a niche in the [[Space Rescue Corps]] instead. By this time Sepen had become an experienced [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]], sensor operator and fighter, but her ability was borne of a survivor's instinctive wariness and a tough, unsentimental approach to problem-solving. In the crew of the ''No Luck Required'', her abilities and personality secured her the post as Uldir's second-in-command. But beneath her hard-bitten exterior, she seemed to have concealed stronger feelings for her \"Boss-boy\" than he realized.\n\nAs a result, Sepen reacted with hostility to the growing closeness between Uldir and the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Klin-Fa Gi]], but she put aside her suspicions and worked with them to defeat the rogue Jedi [[Bey Gandan]] and a Yuuzhan Vong plot to poison the [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] supply on [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Emissary of the Void]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Vega Sepen\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sepen, Vega}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Spacers]]"}}}]}}}}
