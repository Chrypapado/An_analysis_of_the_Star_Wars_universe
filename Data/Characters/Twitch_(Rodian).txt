He's wild, he's unpredictable, he's borderline psychotic&hellip; and he's the best damn duelist in the game today!|An [[Unidentified announcer|announcer]] at the [[Taris dueling ring]] in [[3956 BBY]].|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Twitch''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] who was the only [[Alien/Legends|alien]] duelist in the [[Taris dueling ring]] at the time of the [[destruction of Taris]]. He was thought to be mentally unstable, but it did not stop him from becoming the dueling champion of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] after he defeated the former champion, [[Marl]]. His psychotic personality led to several exciting matches, and his popularity soared, but it still paled in comparison to that of [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]].\n\n==Biography==\nTwitch was a [[Gender/Legends|male]], [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Dueling|duelist]] who competed on the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|city world]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] in the [[Upper City]]'s [[Taris dueling ring]] owned by [[Ajuur]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]].<ref name=\"kotor\" /> By [[3956 BBY]], before the destruction of the ''[[Endar Spire]]'' by a [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] led by the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Malak]], he had become the dueling champion of Taris, having claimed the position after defeating the former champion, a veteran [[Human/Legends|Human]] duelist named [[Marl]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nIn 3956 BBY, the amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] used the alias of \"[[Mysterious Stranger|The Mysterious Stranger]]\" in the dueling ring to earn [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] while searching for the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Bastila Shan]] on the Taris.<ref name=\"kotor\" /> After defeating the lesser duelists, [[Deadeye Duncan]], [[Gerlon Two-Fingers]], [[Ice (duelist)|Ice]], and Marl, the former champion, Revan defeated Twitch to become the dueling champion of Taris.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Twitch-duel.png|thumb|left|200px|Twitch wielding two blaster pistols]]\nTwitch was spontaneous and dynamic in his mannerisms, but was not always one for lucid conversations. Because of his nonsensical speech and eccentric behavior, he was widely regarded by the public as mentally unhinged. Despite, or perhaps because of this, many of his audience were thrilled by his wild, unpredictable style and rapid reflexes with his blasters. As a new and younger champion, replacing the elderly Marl, Twitch was respected for his expert performance, crazy or not. Even so, he was not as skilled as Bendak Starkiller, the legendary former champion who only fought death matches, and Gerlon Two-Fingers thought that not even Twitch was insane enough to challenge Bendak.\n\n==Equipment==\nTwitch favored two [[Heavy blaster pistol/Legends|heavy blaster pistols]] as his chosen weapons in the [[Taris dueling ring]]. Like the other duelists, he reserved a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]] as a side-arm in the event an opponent with a melee weapon managed to close the gap to him.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTwitch first appeared in [[BioWare]]'s [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' [[video game]] as a non-player character. In the Taris dueling ring, he serves as the fifth combatant in the dueling ring for the player, with only [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]] left for the player to duel in an illegal death match, which gives the player [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Taris/Legends|Taris]] Dueling Champion\n|years=&ndash;[[3956 BBY]]<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'', The New Essential Chronology places the destruction of Taris at 3956 BBY which happens during the Knights of the Old Republic video game around the time Twitch was the Dueling Champion.</ref>\n|before=[[Marl]]<ref name=\"KotOR\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', When Marl retires after [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] defeats him he says that before it was only Twitch that defeated him, which means that he was the dueling champion before Twitch.</ref>\n|before-years=\n|after=[[Revan/Legends|Revan]] (as the \"[[Mysterious Stranger]]\")<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n|after-years=[[3956 BBY]]<ref name=\"NEC\" />\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Twitch (Rodianer)#legends\n|es=Twitch\n|pl=Twitch\n|ru=\u0422\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0447 (\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Aliases, nicknames, and pseudonyms]]\n[[Category:Duelists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
