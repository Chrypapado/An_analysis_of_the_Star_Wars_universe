They...didn't come in time.|[[Carth Onasi]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Morgana Onasi''' was the wife of [[Carth Onasi]] and the mother of [[Dustil Onasi]].\n\n==Biography==\nCarth served in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] military during the [[Mandalorian Wars]], leaving Morgana and Dustil on their own. At the end of the war, Carth came back to [[Telos IV|Telos]] with the intention of forever being with his [[Onasi family|family]]. However, at the outset of the [[Jedi Civil War]] Carth reenlisted, feeling that the Republic needed him. Morgana hated this choice, but accepted it.\n\nDuring the war, Telos came under [[Bombing of Telos IV|attack]] by the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] fleet. [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]], ordered by [[Darth Malak]], bombarded the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] from orbit as proof of his change of allegiance. Carth arrived with a Republic contingent soon after the bombing to find Morgana near death and Dustil missing. He held her and screamed for the medics, but she died before they arrived.\n\nWhen Carth and Dustil met two years later in the Sith Academy on Korriban, Dustil cited the failure of the Republic in general, and Carth in specific, to protect Morgana as a reason for his turn to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAccording to Carth, Morgana was courageous and stubborn. Carth said that he could never talk her out of anything she set her mind to.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', Carth Onasi's wife went unnamed.
