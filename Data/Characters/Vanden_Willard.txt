He served at the [[Great Temple|Rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]] during the [[Battle of Yavin]].

When Dodonna asked whether there were any other reversion signatures, Willard replied that it was just the Death Star's. A partial transcript of recordings from the war room, which included Willard's comment, was eventually placed in ''[[The Rebel Files]]''.<ref name=\"Rebel Files\" />\n\n===At Mako-Ta Rebel Base===\n{{Quote|No. That's&hellip;&hellip;Willard's ship.|Leia Organa, on witnessing the attack on Willard's cruiser|Star Wars (2015) 50}}\n[[File:SW_50_Delta_Group.png|thumb|right|250px|General Willard in his cruiser when the rebels were under attack.]]\nAfter a failed meeting with [[Regent]] [[Dors Urtya]] on [[Mon Cala]] in an attempt to recruit the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]], Willard was present at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]] in a meeting of [[Alliance High Command]] when [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] requested the report on Mon Cala by Organa. As Organa stated that Urtya would never lead a mutiny against the Empire, Willard reacted with disappointment. Organa continued, and outlined her plan to rescue [[King of Mon Cala|King]] [[Lee-Char]], in order to secure an alliance with the [[Mon Calamari]] and incorporate the [[fleet]] into their own [[Rebel Alliance Navy|naval forces]].<ref name=\"SW 45\" />\n\nEventually, Organa and [[Heroes of Yavin|her team]] were able to breach a [[Unidentified Imperial base (Strokill Prime)|prison]] on [[Strokill Prime]] and find Lee-Char. Too injured to move, they recorded his final words before he was [[Death|killed]] by Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s.<ref name=\"SW 48\">[[Star Wars (2015) 48|''Star Wars'' (2015) 48]]</ref> Although Urtya was able to recover the recordings from Organa, he sent the message to the [[Fleet Captain]]s of the Mon Cala fleet, resulting in their [[Mutiny on Mon Cala|mutiny]] and defection to the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"SW 49\">[[Star Wars (2015) 49|''Star Wars'' (2015) 49]]</ref>\n\nAfter the mutiny, Willard was given command of ''[[Yavin's Hope]]'' that had been refitted for combat by the [[Kingdom of Shu-Torun]], by order of [[Queen]] [[Trios]]. Willard utilized the [[cruiser]] as the [[flagship]] of [[Delta Group]] and remained present at the Mako-Ta Space Docks during a ceremony celebrating the new Alliance Fleet and for rebel personnel and rebel allies to witness the dispersal of the rebel [[Navy|naval]] forces. During the ceremony, Willard invited Organa to his cruiser, but she turned down the request, preferring to be with Mothma just in case she was needed.<ref name=\"SW 50\" />\n\nPrior to launch, Organa asked for a check-in of sub-groups, and Willard was the final one to confirm that group had no issues. Willard also told Organa to tell Mothma good luck for her speech, believing that she would stun the crowd. After Organa informed Mothma that the fleet was ready, she also mentioned Willard's statement, and told Mothma that he knew he would be impressed.<ref name=\"SW 50\" />\n\nAs the ships were ready to launch into [[hyperspace]], an error prevented the launch of the Willard's cruiser, as well as all the other ships that had been refitted with [[Shu-Torun]] technology. The fault resulted in the failure of all launches, lost communications, disabled armament, and the ships being unable to launch their [[starfighter]]s. At the same [[time]], [[Death Squadron]], under the command of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], [[Assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks|arrived]] and fired on the nearest cruiser, Willard's starship.<ref name=\"SW 50\" />\n\n===Death===\n{{Quote|Quickly, abandon ship!

Consistently pummeled by [[laser]] fire, Willard ordered all power to be routed to the [[deflector shield]]s, but a crewmember stated that they were quickly losing them.
