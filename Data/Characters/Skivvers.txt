I have message for you.|Skivvers, to Kestrel|Rookies: Rendezvous}}\n'''Skivvers''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Ho'Din/Legends|Ho'Din]] who operated out of [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] as a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]]. Due to a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] placed on his head, he was forced to keep a low profile, yet this did not prevent him from keeping in contact with his underworld connections. These included the veteran [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] recruiter [[Tay Vanis]]. In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Skivvers passed on a message from Vanis to [[Raleigh Dawn]], enabling her to join the Rebel Alliance with three other recruits.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Skivvers_work.png|thumb|left|250px|Skivvers at his workbench.]]\nSkivvers was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Ho'Din/Legends|Ho'Din]] who worked as a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] on the [[Mid Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]]. His activity caused a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] to be placed on his head, severely restricting his freedom of movement. The slicer had a number of contacts in the underworld, such as \"[[Kestrel]]\" and [[Tay Vanis]], a recruiter for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] working with the [[Lens Reekeene|Reekeene's]] [[Reekeene's Roughnecks|Roughnecks]].<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\nOn one occasion in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Kestrel approached the Ho'Din, requesting he slice a bounty posting placed on \"[[Raleigh Dawn]]\"&mdash;in actuality, \"Kestrel\" was an alias being used by Dawn herself&mdash;to determine who had placed the bounty. Encouraged by the gift of a [[Mordanthi bloomer]] Kestrel bought from a visiting [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Ithorian Herdship/Legends|herdship]], the Ho'Din investigated briefly;<ref name=\"RR\" /> however, since the bounty was for [[Bounty hunter/Legends|hunters]] with [[Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate/Legends|Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificates]] only,<ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|pablog|54|Rookies: Rendezvous -- Week Six Annotations|Fragments from the Mind's Eye|Pablo Hidalgo|archivedate=20080904231431}}.</ref> he refused to do further work for free. He did, however, pass on a message from Vanis to Kestrel, advising her to retrieve a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] from an alleyway near residence [[21|#21]], which she did. As a result, Vanis contacted the woman in person to give her further instructions with regard to joining the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Don't sneaks up like that! You knows I don't sees so good.|Skivvers, to Kestrel|Rookies: Rendezvous}}\nSkivvers was a slicer,<ref name=\"RR\" /> somewhat unusual for a Ho'Din since most of the species reviled technology, and its use was forbidden on their ancestral [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]].<ref>[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']].</ref> For his work, Skivvers was forced to wear thick corrective [[Spectacles|lenses]] to compensate for his poor eyesight. The Ho'Din also had a love for plants, growing a number of pot-plants around his work bench and regretting that the bounty placed on his head prevented him from visiting an Ithorian herdship that visited Ord Mantell. While the Ho'Din could speak [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], it was often riddled with grammatical errors.<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSkivvers was created by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] for the [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]]-exclusive [[Webstrips|webstrip]] ''[[Rookies: Rendezvous]]'', where the Ho'Din appeared in strips #23&ndash;27. Hidalgo mentioned the Ho'Din in some of the webstrip annotations he posted on his blog; there, he suggested that Skivvers is slightly shorter than the average Ho'Din,<ref name=\"blog\" /> listed in the ''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]'' as 2.75 meters.<ref name=\"UAA\">''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''.</ref> When prompted by a poster, he also indicated that in the scene where Skivvers is modifying a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] on his desk, it is \"very, very likely\" the Ho'Din is modifying it to carry data in accordance with the technique depicted in ''[[Cracken's Rebel Field Guide]]''.<ref name=\"blog\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rookies: Rendezvous]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Blog|pablog|53|Rookies: Rendezvous -- Week Five Annotations|Fragments from the Mind's Eye|Pablo Hidalgo|archivedate=20081001205159}}\n*{{Blog|pablog|54|Rookies: Rendezvous -- Week Six Annotations|Fragments from the Mind's Eye|Pablo Hidalgo|archivedate=20080904231431}}\n\n[[Category:Ho'Din]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mantellians]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
