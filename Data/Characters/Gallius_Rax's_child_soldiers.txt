Rax placed them under the command of [[Armitage Hux]], who trained the [[Youngling|children]] to become the [[First Order]]'s initial [[squad]] of [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]].\n\n==Description==\n{{Quote|That's where most of the kids are kept. Nobody wants children running underfoot when you have a heavy-gauge blast-drill blowing chunks of canyon wall apart. So they dump them there, with the anchorites and their nurse-women.

At the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Jakku]], most of the children were in their pre-teen or early adolescent [[Standard year|years]]. They wore plain [[Color|white]] [[Clothing|uniforms]] that resembled nightclothes, and wielded improvised [[Knife|knives]] and [[blaster]]s. Several known members included a tall [[Gender|girl]] with her [[hair]] shorn to the scalp, a boy about [[Armitage Hux]]'s age with tar-dark hair and sun-marked skin, and another boy with sandy hair and sallow cheeks. They were trained to obey the orders of Gallius Rax, [[Brendol Hux]], and his [[Hux family|son]] Armitage.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==History==\n{{Quote|The Empire must be fertile and young. Children are crucial to our success. Many of our officers are old. We need that kind of vitality. That brand of energy you get with the young. The Empire needs children.|Gallius Rax|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n[[File:Cardinal.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Captain]] [[Archex|Cardinal]] was one of Gallius Rax's child soldiers.]]\nBefore the Battle of Jakku, Gallius Rax recruited two dozen orphans from Jakku to become child soldiers. These orphans were kidnapped by the [[Hutt]] [[Crime lord|crime lady]] [[Niima]], who forged an agreement with Rax in return for receiving weapons. Rax targeted the orphanages run by the Anchorites due to his animus to his former master [[Kolob]]. Rax's subordinate, the former [[Commandant]] Brendol Hux, trained these orphans into a fearsome force of child soldiers and [[assassin]]s who were loyal to Rax. Rax used these orphans to assassinate the [[Propaganda|propagandist]] [[Ferric Obdur]] and later to [[Death|execute]] an entire unit of [[stormtrooper]]s. These killings were part of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine's]] posthumous [[Contingency]] plan to tear down the [[Galactic Empire]] in the event of his death.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nRax planned to take these child soldiers along with Hux, his son Armitage, and several other worthy Imperial [[commander]]s into the [[Unknown Regions]] to start a new Empire. Prior to his death, Rax gave the young Armitage command of the child soldiers and tasked him with leading them. Following the Battle of Jakku, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], who inherited the Contingency plan from Rax, struck a deal with Armitage to protect the boy from his [[Parent|father]] if he would ensure that the child soldiers did not attack her during the voyage. After [[Standard month|months]] of travel, the child soldiers along with the Hux's and Sloane rendezvoused in uncharted space with the Emperor's [[flagship]] [[Eclipse (Executor-class)|''Eclipse'']].<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nThe child soldiers' leader Armitage later became a [[General]] in the [[First Order]] and modeled its [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] training regime after techniques that his father developed while he was a Commandant at the [[Arkanis Academy]].<ref name=\"TFAVD\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGallius Rax's child soldiers first appeared in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2017]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]'', the last installment in ''[[Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy]]''. It is strongly hinted in the text that these child soldiers became the [[First Order]]'s first [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]]. In ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]'', it is mentioned that General Hux and his father were part of the Imperial exodus that fled into the Unknown Regions following the Battle of Jakku and the signing of the [[Galactic Concordance]]. The younger Hux is credited with modelling the First Order's stormtrooper training regiment using techniques that his father had developed at the [[Arkanis Academy]].<ref name=\"TFAVD\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Aftermath: Empire's End (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Empire's End'' audiobook]]\n*[[Phasma (novel)|''Phasma'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Phasma (audiobook)|''Phasma'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire (audiobook)|''Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Black Series|pack=Captain Cardinal|altlink=https://www.target.com/p/star-wars-the-black-series-captain-cardinal-toy-figure/-/A-79416662|archiveurl=https://archive.vn/KTjH8}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Ni\u00f1os soldados de Gallius Rax\n}}\n\n[[Category:Child soldiers]]\n[[Category:First Order organizations]]\n[[Category:Jakku residents]]\n[[Category:Inner Rim organizations]]"}}}]}}}}
