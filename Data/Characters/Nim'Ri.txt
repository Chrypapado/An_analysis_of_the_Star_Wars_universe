He disappeared himself from his daily life and helped form the [[Cularin resistance]]. He might have helped decoding the password for the [[Cloud Mountain mines|secret base]].<ref name=\"TRW\" />\n\nNim'Ri become one of the leaders of the group, firmly believing that their work would be the last hope of the system. He was a moderate influence between [[Gerta Haman]]'s peaceful idealism and [[Broof Yurdel]]'s [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] warrior fierceness. Along with them, Nim'Ri greeted some unexpected visitors, who might have been the people who were looking for Darin one month before. They were looking into the massive disappearances as a favor to Jedi Master [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]]. Nim'Ri and the others tried to convince them not to reveal anything about the Cularin resistance<ref name=\"TRW\" />\n\nNim'Ri was in the base when, one month later, the Cartel found it and launched an attack with a Caarite hit force. Nim'Ri helped Yurdel against the Caarites, but Gerta Haman was seriously injured during the shootout. Yurdel was distraught at that and wanted to destroy the Cartel base with great violence. Nim'Ri believed that Yurdel was too careless and that he could get killed in the attack.<ref name=\"ARv\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref> The Trandoshan, an expert in Caarite tactics,<ref name=\"ACP\" /> organized part of the attack, including briefing some allies who were to slice in the Cartel's computers, and later he took part in the battle, co-leading the troops along with Yurdel in their attack to the [[Metatheran Cartel jungle base]].<ref name=\"ARv\" />\n\nThe battle was a great victory for the resistance, and led to the Cartel retreating from Cularin. Governor [[Barnab Chistor]] of Gadrin condecorated Nim'Ri and the other resistance leaders and heroes.<ref name=\"ARv\" /> Then, Nim'Ri returned to his previous post on House Hirskaala.<ref name=\"CME\">''[[Cularin's Militia: Exposed!]]''</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Thaereian military]] seemed to be exceeding its mandate in protecting the [[Cularin system]] in [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]], Nim'Ri resigned his job and disappared. Although his friend Yurdel joined the nascent [[Cularin Militia]], to build up a native defense force for the Cularin system, Nim'Ri was not seen with this group<ref name=\"CME\" /> or elsewhere in the system. A rumor said that Nim'Ri had returned to his native Trandoshan planet but, as Nim'Ri had not been born on [[Trandosha/Legends|Trandosha]] (and as he was a known freedom fighter who would not give up during hard times and would instead threaten the threateners), this canard was an obvious hoax. Some people believed that the Thaereians had secretly killed Nim'Ri and then developed the false hearsay.<ref name=\"CAN\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Cularin Presence]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]''\n*''[[A Revelation]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030109exposed|text=Cularin's Militia: Exposed!|int=Cularin's Militia: Exposed!|archivedate=20090603045620}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Air Up Thaere]]''\n*''[[Memories]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20031002cularin|text=Cularin at Night|int=Cularin at Night|archivedate=20090603045459}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Trandoshans]]"}}}]}}}}
