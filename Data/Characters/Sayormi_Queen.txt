To protect the trees, Kerritamba asked the spacer to strike at the core of the Sayormi people and kill their queen.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Sayormi Queen appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011.\n\nThe queen does not seem to belong to the same species as the other Sayormi, who resemble [[Sanyassan]]s. Her facial tattoos and clothes are more reminiscent of the depictions of [[Witches of Dathomir]] or [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]] in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', she even wears a Nightsister headdress.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Rage of the Wookiees}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Threat_of_the_Conqueror#Card_gallery|cardname=Sayormi Queen}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Unidentified religious figures]]"}}}]}}}}
