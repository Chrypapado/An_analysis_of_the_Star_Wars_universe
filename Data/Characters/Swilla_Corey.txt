Born a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]], she was liberated by raiding [[Karazak Slavers Cooperative|Karazak slavers]] while her master was visiting Tatooine. She decided to make a new life for herself on the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] planet, and continued doing what she had done as a slave: tended to animals. She found limited amounts of work at local ranches, and was able to make ends meet.\n\nHer success came to an end, however, when her jerba herd was scattered by a [[Sandstorm/Legends|sandstorm]]. Financially ruined, Corey moved to [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], and became a pickpocket. Eventually, she passed on her skills to initiates in the art of thievery. One day, she spotted one of her jerbas outside [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Cantina]], and investigated. She discovered that the [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Ketwol/Legends|Ketwol]] had chanced upon it, as it had wandered out of the desert. The [[Pacithhip/Legends|Pacithhip]] helped her rebuild her jerba herd, allowing Corey to return to her former home.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn into a life of [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]], the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Swilla Corey worked as an animal hand under a [[Tarnab/Legends|Tarnab]] [[Merchant/Legends|merchant]], gaining experience and knowledge. While in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] above [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], the merchant was attacked by [[Karazak Slavers Cooperative|Karazak slavers]]. Corey was able to escape to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] surface unharmed, and, with her newfound freedom, she decided to use her skills with animals to forge a new life for herself.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nWorking on a [[Jerba/Legends|jerba]] ranch near the [[Motesta Oasis/Legends|Motesta Oasis]], Corey set up residence in an abandoned hut nearby. She would travel the countryside, through farming communities, trading jerba leather, [[Milk/Legends|milk]], and meat. Though she was never financially secure, Corey was satisfied with just reveling in her freedom&mdash;a stark contrast from her upbringing in slavery.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===Disaster strikes===\n[[File:SwillaCorey.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Swilla Corey in Chalmun's Cantina]]\nCorey's entire jerba herd was scattered during a [[Sandstorm/Legends|sandstorm]], and the added antagonism of a wild [[Anooba/Legends|anooba]] pack did not help. With no assets whatsoever, Corey abandoned her hut, and moved to [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. There, she was forced to resort to petty thievery and begging. Eventually, she began passing on her robbery skills to other initiates in the craft. One day, she saw her brand on a jerba outside [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Cantina]], and she entered to investigate. Consulting one of her colleagues, the [[Yam'rii/Legends|Yam'rii]] [[Kitik Keed'kak]], she was told that the jerba belonged to a [[Pacithhip/Legends|Pacithhip]] named [[Ketwol/Legends|Ketwol]]. Seeking answers, she hurried outside in order to wait for Ketwol, just as the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] stirred up trouble in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] by attacking [[Ponda Baba/Legends|Ponda Baba]] and [[Cornelius Evazan/Legends|Cornelius Evazan]].<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"ccg\">{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Dark/large/swillacorey.gif|cardname=Swilla Corey}}</ref>\n\n===Meeting Ketwol===\nTailing the Pacithhip to his [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the ''[[Herd Mother]]'', Corey discovered that Ketwol was using the battered ship as a home. Seeking the right moment, she attempted to steal the jerba, but Ketwol detected the thievery, and stopped her. He explained that the animals had wandered out of the desert towards his ship, and as some of them had been exhausted or wounded, he had cared for them. In turn, Corey told her tale of misfortune, and Ketwol decided to give her shelter. Eventually, Swilla gathered her jerbas and returned to the desert, with the knowledge that she could always return to the hospitality and companionship of Ketwol.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBereft of lofty ambitions, Swilla Corey, upon being freed, was content with just making ends meet. Instead of making her new life a bountiful one, she preferred a simple existence with her jerba herd, as it was probably the only thing she knew how to do well. However, her lack of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] drove her to thievery when she lost her herd. Corey eventually grew proficient in this craft, and was adept at passing her skills onto others. She was also particularly curious, and did not give up the hope of finding her herd after the sandstorm that had scattered it.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"ccg\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|I never intended to make Swilla a bad person. Someone can steal for many reasons. Robin Hood also stole from the rich people.

The artists further added lighting effects and details, and then integrated the character image back into the scene.<ref name=\"Creating Reality\">{{Cite_web|url=http://decipher.com/thegalleries/creatingreality/swillacoreyshow.html|title=The Galleries: Swilla Corey|archivedate=19980717103758}}</ref> \"Swilla Corey\" is in fact an anagram of Carol Wisely, a Decipher employee.<ref name=\"dforum\">[http://www.swccgpc.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8484&sid=b84cb3e4b7a87e4b741eafe1908ce12f \"Anagram Card Titles\"], SWCCG Player's Committee forums</ref> In 2005, Corey's backstory was elaborated on by [[Tim Veekhoven]] through the first round of the [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature, \"[[What's The Story?]]\". Veekhoven initially meant to have [[Momaw Nadon/Legends|Momaw Nadon]] as the character who aids Corey, but changed it to Ketwol after reading in ''[[The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide]]'' that Pacithhip often herded jerbas. The change was made due to the fact that Veekhoven believed that Nadon had already appeared in a plethora of [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] material, and as jerbas had already been written into his entry, this change seemed natural.<ref name=\"swblog\">{{Blog|teekay-421|13|They were the chosen ones|Sompeetalay's Source Blog|Tim Veekhoven|archivedate=20100414013925}}</ref> Swilla Corey was later given an entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Swilla Corey}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Dark/large/swillacorey.gif|cardname=Swilla Corey}} {{1stID}}\n*{{InsiderCite|31|Pick a Card, Any Card: Making Movie Magic at Decipher, Inc.}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|swillacorey|Swilla Corey|archivedate=20100414081836}}\n*{{SW|url=news/drawing-from-the-imagination-mythological-creatures-in-star-wars-part-1|int=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in Star Wars|text=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in ''Star Wars'', Part 1}}\n*{{SW|url=news/drawing-from-the-imagination-mythological-creatures-in-star-wars-part-2|int=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in Star Wars|text=Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in ''Star Wars'', Part 2}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-holiday-special-cantina-we-may-not-thrive-friend-but-we-survive-friend|text=''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' Cantina: Who's Who|int=The Star Wars Holiday Special Cantina: Who's Who}}\n*{{SW|url=news/id-just-as-soon-kiss-a-wookiee-star-wars-romances|text=I'd Just as Soon Kiss a Wookiee: ''Star Wars'' Romances}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/bts/article/f20030502/indexp4.html|text=Cantina Roll-Call: Shedding Light on Some Alien Aliases - Louie, Louie|archivedate=20041209222741}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/02/photoreceptor20040227.html|text=Local Girl}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=community/news/blog/news20050928.html|text=Featured Blog: ''Sompeetalay's Source Blog''|archivedate=20080605002347}}\n*{{Blog|teekay-421|13|They were the chosen ones|Sompeetalay's Source Blog|Tim Veekhoven|archivedate=20100414013925}}\n*[http://www.decipher.com/artshow/creatingreality/swillacoreyshow.html Creating Reality: Taking Swilla Corey From The Shadows]\n*{{SW|url=news/offscreen-but-not-forgotten-mini-rigs-body-rigs-and-other-kenner-vehicles|text=Offscreen, but Not Forgotten: Mini-Rigs, Body-Rigs, and Other Kenner Vehicles}}\n*{{SW|url=news/f-a-c-t-s-2013-report-from-the-largest-convention-in-the-benelux|text=F.A.C.T.S. 2013: Report from the Largest Convention in the Benelux}}\n*{{SW|url=news/vintage-kenner-collectors-cases-warning-may-cause-hibernation-sickness-for-action-figures|text=Vintage Kenner Collector's Cases: Warning!
