Her [[Parent/Legends|father]] [[Death/Legends|passed away]] from [[Knowt's Disease]] when she was [[16 ABY/Legends|three years old]], and her mother was [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Corellian Crisis)|killed]] during the [[Corellian Crisis]] [[18 ABY/Legends|two years later]]. Thanas was adopted by a well-placed [[Bakuran]] family and was sponsored and frequently visited by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], who had drawn her mother into the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] insurrection and felt responsible for the young Thanas. She became very fond of Skywalker, but harbored a deep hatred for the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government that he had acted on behalf of. As she grew up, she developed a strong belief in the [[Cosmic Balance]] religion, and at [[28 ABY/Legends|the age of fifteen]], she formed a resistance movement known as [[Freedom resistance movement|Freedom]] and began peacefully protesting Bakura's role in the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]], the New Republic's successor state. Thanas lobbied for Bakuran independence but took a firm stand against Freedom's members use of violence to get their voices heard due to her fear of backlash from the Cosmic Balance. She was nevertheless arrested on charges of disturbing the peace and conspiracy, and was brought to a [[Salis D'aar Penitentiary|prison]] in [[Salis D'aar/Legends|Salis D'aar]], [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura's]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]].\n\nSeveral members of Skywalker's [[Skywalker family/Legends|family]] came to Bakura at the [[Time/Legends|time]] of Thanas's arrest, and when his niece [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] visited her in [[Prison/Legends|prison]], Bakuran authorities engineered her escape in order to follow the two of them to Freedom's [[The Stack|headquarters]]. As security officials closed in on them, Thanas and her closest friends fled and appealed to Bakura's [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Blaine Harris]], who had been covertly funding their organization, for help. However, he planned to kill Thanas and to use her status as a martyr to unite Bakura behind him as he seized power within the government. Harris brought Thanas, Solo, and [[Vyram]], another member of Freedom, to a [[Salis D'aar stadium|stadium]] where Bakura's new allies, the [[P'w'eck Emancipation Movement]], were performing a [[Consecration Ceremony]] to signal the beginning of the partnership. The ceremony was in fact a ruse organized to allow the expansionist [[Ssi-ruuvi Imperium]], who had [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] the [[P'w'eck]], to attempt to [[Battle of Bakura (28 ABY)|invade]] Bakura, and Thanas and her friends fled from the invaders into tunnels beneath the stadium after they escaped from Harris's clutches. Several [[Ssi-ruu]]k warriors followed them, but were subdued by P'w'eck who began to actually revolt. The mutiny curtailed the invasion, and Thanas and Vyram were subsequently hired by the Bakuran government to trace a trail of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] that had been laundered offworld. The investigation was an effort to both expose [[Senator/Legends|senatorial]] corruption and to demonstrate the good intentions of Freedom to a skeptical public.\n\n==Biography==\n===Losing her parents===\n{{Quote|I barely remember her.

Despite having retired, Captison was appointed to the [[Starship/Legends|ships]] as a representative of the [[Bakuran Senate]], and invited Skywalker to her home on the morning of her departure so that he could meet Thanas. Thanas was sad to see her mother go, but asked Skywalker to promise to take care of her. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] agreed, and Captison left her daughter in the care of two friends, Madame [[Boble]] and Lady [[Corwell]], as well as Thanas's [[Captison family|extended family]].<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\nCaptison was drawn into the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Corellian Crisis|conflict]], and was killed during its climactic [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Corellian Crisis)|battle]] between the New Republic and the power-hungry [[Sacorrian Triad]].<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\">''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''</ref> Thanas's family attempted to explain to her why her mother was not going to return to Bakura.

And that's all we got, too: scraps.|Thanas expresses her distaste of the New Republic to Jaina Solo|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\n[[File:Salisdaar.jpg|thumb|left|195px|Malinza Thanas organized protests against the New Republic in the city of Salis D'aar.]]\nBy the year [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]], the New Republic had reorganized itself into a [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]] in order to better resist the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], an [[extra-galactic]] [[Species/Legends|species]] of religious zealots bent on conquering [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Bakura remained untouched by the invaders and fell out of contact with the Galactic Alliance amidst the chaos of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War|war]]. While the rest of the galaxy fought the Yuuzhan Vong, Thanas organized an anti-New Republic resistance movement on Bakura called [[Freedom resistance movement|Freedom]]. Sixteen people strong, Freedom protested what they saw as Bakura's constant kowtowing to the New Republic; they believed that the planet needed to remain independent from the new Galactic Alliance and govern itself. Thanas refused to allow members of Freedom to use violent means to get their voices heard, and chose instead to capitalize on her late parents' reputations through the organization of public protests in Bakura's [[Capital/Legends|capital]], [[Salis D'aar/Legends|Salis D'aar]]. The group was covertly funded by Bakura's [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Blaine Harris]], who, although he believed in their cause, secretly wanted to seize power within the government.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nWhen the Bakuran Senate was approached by the [[P'w'eck Emancipation Movement]] and was offered an alliance against the [[Ssi-ruuvi Imperium]], Freedom supported the idea. With the [[P'w'eck]] as their [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]], the [[Ssi-ruu]]k of the Imperium had unsuccessfully attempted to [[Ssi-ruuvi invasions|invade]] Bakura [[4 ABY/Legends|twenty-four years prior]]. The P'w'eck had since organized an emancipation movement to attempt to win their liberty, and Freedom saw them as a viable alternative to the Galactic Alliance in helping defend Bakura from a potential Yuuzhan Vong attack. However, many Bakuran citizens who opposed the P'w'eck alliance joined Freedom and began to violently protest in the streets of Salis D'aar. Public opinion of Freedom plummeted, and Thanas and her closest friends opted to proceed more quietly toward their goals as they [[Slicer/Legends|sliced]] into government files and uncovered evidence of [[Senator/Legends|senatorial]] corruption. Their hope was to blackmail Bakura's senate into governing honestly. Thanas and her friends began to trace a financial deal that sent millions of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] offworld through several intermediaries shortly after the P'w'ecks' arrival on Bakura, but an alarm was tripped during their investigation, and Thanas was arrested on charges of disturbing the peace and conspiracy. Many within the government also suspected that she was responsible for the kidnapping of Bakura's Prime Minister, [[Molierre Cundertol]], who had disappeared shortly after he had personally invited the P'w'eck's [[Keeramak]] leader to Bakura to consecrate the planet.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nThe day that Thanas was taken into custody, several representatives of the Galactic Alliance arrived at Bakura after they received a tip from a [[Unidentified Ryn|member]] of the information-gathering [[Ryn Network]] that something bad was soon going to happen on the planet. Among them were Luke Skywalker's sister [[Leia Organa Solo]], brother-in-law [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and niece Jaina Solo. When the group was tipped off by the [[Ryn/Legends|Ryn]] [[Goure Conor]] that Thanas had information they would need to solve their mystery, Jaina ventured to the [[Salis D'aar Penitentiary]] and was permitted to visit the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] in Cell Twelve-Seventeen. Despite Solo's ties to the Galactic Alliance, Thanas found that she easily trusted Skywalker's niece and told her about Freedom's goals and recent history, although she left out any mention of Harris's involvement. Solo revealed that Cundertol had resurfaced, had claimed to have escaped from his kidnappers, and was skeptical that Thanas was in league with them. When the young [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] rose to leave, she and Thanas discovered that the [[Prison/Legends|prison]] was devoid of guards. Thanas suspected that one of her friends had sliced into the facility's systems to help her escape, and eagerly followed Solo into the slums of the [[City/Legends|city]].<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\n===Maze of deception===\n{{Quote|Within the hour, this planet will be a consecrated part of the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement. And you, dear Malinza, will be a martyr to your cause. Doesn't that fill you with pride?|Blaine Harris|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\nThe two young women leapt across deserted rooftops until Solo [[Force sense/Legends|sensed]] danger and shielded Thanas with her body. When several voices from a nearby [[Tree/Legends|tree]] addressed the Jedi, Thanas identified them as her comrades [[Vyram]], [[Jjorg]], [[Salkeli]], and [[Zel (Bakuran)|Zel]], and assured them that Solo was a friend. The five members of Freedom led Solo to [[the Stack]], a building that served as their headquarters, and began to posit theories on who had broken Thanas out of prison. While Vyram showed Solo the mysterious financial deal they had been tracking, he detected some electronic interference and discovered a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing beacon]] that had been stitched into Thanas's pants. The Stack's perimeter alarm was tripped as Bakuran security officials moved in on their location, and Solo fled with the beacon, bringing Salkeli along to navigate the city for her. Thanas and the others escaped in another direction, but were pursued by security officials who shot and killed Zel.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nThanas, Vyram, and Jjorg made their way to [[Blaine Harris's private chambers|Harris's private chambers]], hoping that the Deputy Prime Minister could help to clear them of criminal charges. Harris had plans of his own, however, and had employed the equally duplicitous Salkeli to capture Solo and bring her to his chambers. He hoped to prevent the Galactic Alliance from interfering with his plans to kill Thanas and turn her into a martyr that would unite the Bakuran people behind him. As Salkeli moved to secure [[stun cuffs]] around the wrists of all of Harris's guests, Thanas kneed him in the groin, which prompted Harris to shoot Jjorg dead. Thanas and Vyram were then fitted with binders, although Solo kept hers from locking by using a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] on Salkeli. Harris and Salkeli then led their prisoners to the [[Salis D'aar stadium|stadium]] where the Keeramak's [[Consecration Ceremony]] was underway.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\n[[File:Ssi-Ruu_v_Jedi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Thanas was present when Jaina Solo battled Ssi-Ruuvi warriors during their attempted invasion of Bakura.]]\nHarris ushered his prisoners into one of the stadium's equipment lockers, sealed the door, and coerced Solo into pressing a remote detonator by holding Thanas at [[Blaster/Legends|blasterpoint]]. The bomb's timed detonation would kill Cundertol, much of the senate, and Solo's parents; Harris intended to himself murder both Solo and Thanas. He planned to claim that Solo had attempted to derail the treaty between Bakura and the P'w'eck, and that Thanas had sacrificed herself to foil the Jedi Knight. As he prepared to use Solo's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to inflict realistic-looking wounds on Thanas, Solo loosed her binders, [[Telekinesis/Legends|retrieved]] her lightsaber with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and bludgeoned Harris [[Sleep/Legends|unconscious]] with it. Thanas sprang into action as well and pinned Salkeli to the floor, twisting one of his [[Limb/Legends|arms]] behind his back. Solo freed Thanas and Vyram of their binders, but the trio discovered that a stray [[Laser/Legends|laser]] blast from Harris had melted the remote detonator. Solo seized Salkeli's [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] and instructed her ally [[Tahiri Veila]] to attempt to disarm the bomb, but the detonation occurred and knocked everyone in the locker to the floor.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nAfter the explosion, Goure Conor broke into the equipment locker. Thanas rushed out to expose Harris's plot to the public, only to discover that the consecration ceremony had been a ruse to allow the Ssi-ruuk, disguised as P'w'eck, to launch a [[Battle of Bakura (28 ABY)|full-scale invasion]] of Bakura. She rejoined Vyram in the locker, and the two brought their prisoners into an underground tunnel where the Solos and Conor were leading survivors of the invasion's initial attack away from the stadium. Cundertol was not far behind, having survived the bomb's detonation. He began to interrogate Harris about escape routes, and fired a blaster shot into his subordinate's head when the Deputy Prime Minister claimed that their only choice was to hide in equipment lockers. Cundertol then turned his blaster on Thanas, and began to whistle in the [[Ssi-ruuvi]] [[Language/Legends|language]]. The Keeramak and a group of Ssi-ruuk warriors approached, and called on the ring of survivors to surrender and accept their forthcoming [[entechment]]&mdash;the draining of their life-energy to power Ssi-ruuvi machinery. Cundertol had betrayed his own people after having been promised immortality by the invaders.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nThe Keeramak ordered his P'w'eck slaves to attack the prisoners, but was shot dead by the [[Ssi-ruuvi ion paddle beamer|paddle beamer]] of the P'w'eck [[Lwothin]], who led his brethren in an actual revolt against their masters. Jaina Solo and her lightsaber aided them in the ensuing firefight, and although the P'w'eck were victorious, Cundertol escaped. Concurrent P'w'eck mutinies aboard Ssi-ruuvi [[Cruiser/Legends|cruisers]] in Bakuran [[Realspace/Legends|space]] brought a swift end to the invasion, and the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement formally allied with Bakura. The kidnapping charges leveled against Thanas were overturned, and the government hired her and Vyram to finish tracing the missing credits they had earlier discovered in a demonstration of Freedom's good intentions. The credits had in fact been laundered offworld by Cundertol in order to have a [[Human replica droid]] of himself built, and the Prime Minister had voluntarily undergone the Ssi-ruuvi entechment process in order to have his soul transferred into the [[Droid/Legends|droid's]] body.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> Jaina Solo was later able to track the missing credits to [[Onadax]], where the droid had been built at the headquarters of [[Onadax Droid Technologies]].<ref name=\"Or Die Trying\">{{InsiderCite|75|Or Die Trying}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I don't want to be against anyone, really, because that makes them against me. The Balance kicks back just as hard as we lash out. And trust me, I have no desire to get kicked again.|Malinza Thanas|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\nAt the age of four, Malinza Thanas was a spritely infant who enjoyed bouncing down stairwells and singing songs to herself. She loved her mother deeply and did not want her to leave for the Corellian [[Sector/Legends|sector]].<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" /> When Captison died, Thanas did not fully understand why her mother would not return to Bakura. As she grew up, she retained very few memories of either of her parents.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> Although Luke Skywalker blamed himself for Captison's death,<ref name=\"Jedi Eclipse\" /> Thanas did not, and harbored no resentment toward the Jedi Master. She did begin to despise the New Republic, however; she blamed them for Captison's passing and hated them for dragging Bakura into their struggles. It similarly vexed her that Bakura acquiesced so readily to their requests. To Thanas, the New Republic was a cruel mistress that held Bakura in chains and dragged it into wars and galactic affairs with no regard for the well-being of its people.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nAs a teenager, Thanas organized Freedom, a resistance movement, and began to actively protest against the New Republic and lobby for Bakura's independence. Her belief in the necessity of independence and autonomy extended to Freedom's principles as well; the organization made every effort to remain out of debt to others due to the members' belief that independence was a necessary element of objectivity. Thanas hoped to objectively evaluate the honesty of Bakura's senators, and felt that blackmailing them was in the best interests of the Bakuran public. She supported the idea of an alliance with the P'w'eck, and was very adamant that violence not be on Freedom's agenda, as she did not want Bakura's former regime to be replaced with one that she saw as equally bad. She and her friends thought of Freedom as Bakura's conscience, keeping things in balance.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\n[[File:Cosmic_Balance.svg|thumb|left|225px|The symbol of the Cosmic Balance, the religion that dictated many of Thanas's actions]]\nThanas's belief in the Balance dictated many of her actions. The Cosmic Balance claimed that any great force for good needed a counterbalancing evil force to exist, and that good works for some unintentionally led to evil results for others. As such, Thanas was reluctant to take a stance against others out of fear of backlash from the Balance, and she did not force violent citizens to disassociate themselves from Freedom. She did not encourage them to stay, however. Thanas accepted that the Balance had been behind her mother's death, but was nevertheless unhappy about having been on the receiving end of its actions. She was also initially hesitant to aid Jaina Solo out of fear of the Balance's backlash.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nThanas was very determined in her efforts to resist the New Republic, and impressed Solo with her ability to rise to a cause despite having lost both of her parents so early in her life. She resisted the attempts of Bakuran police to arrest her, and was only brought down by the combined efforts of four [[Officer/Legends|officers]] and two [[Security droid/Legends|security droids]]. She was an able leader of Freedom, remaining calm and directing the actions of its members while their headquarters were being approached by Bakuran police. Solo saw a maturity in her face that was at odds with her young age, and found her gaze piercing. However, Solo also suspected that Thanas fought because she had nothing left to lose, and, although Thanas was proud of her resistance efforts, Solo observed that some of her fire had gone out. As she wearily sat in a prison cell, Thanas resigned herself to the idea that she would not receive a fair trial, and took some small comfort in the idea that any wrong done to her would ensure that some good came to somebody somewhere in the future. Despite her resignation, she was eager to escape from her cell when she found the coast clear.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nA romantic spark existed between Thanas and Vyram that was noticed by Solo on more than one occasion. The two kept their relationship strictly professional in public, however. Thanas was also close with several more of her friends, and was deeply hurt by the deaths of Zel and Jjorg. Although she believed that her allies one day could turn into her enemies the next, the betrayals of Salkeli and Blaine Harris similarly cut her deep. She fought to keep control of her emotions after she discovered their treachery, but broke down after Jjorg's death, openly crying and blaming Solo for not having prevented it. In the ensuing moments, her [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] betrayed her hatred of Salkeli and her fear of death threats issued by Harris.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nThanas was thin and very agile, able to leap across rooftops and swing hand-over-hand across power lines. She often proceeded through such dangerous situations without hesitation. Her black hair was complemented by different-[[Color/Legends|colored]] eyes&mdash;Thanas sported a green left iris and a gray right,<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> although they were both brown in her infancy.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Given plot and time constraints, simply tying off the loose end&mdash;and 'explaining' why none of the preceding authors chose to introduce her as a real character&mdash;was all I could manage.
