Maybe I can help?|[[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]]|Lady Luck (comic)}}\n'''Ymile''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who was the consort of [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]] [[Dominic Raynor]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:YmileLando.jpg|thumb|left|Ymile with Lando Calrissian]]\nDuring [[Dominic Raynor]]'s tenure as [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]] of [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], Ymile frequented the bars and casinos of the elaborate getaway. However, Ymile was unhappy with her residence at Cloud City, and longed to explore [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], but with Raynor's duties as Administrator, she was forced to stay.\n\nLuckily for Ymile, a savvy gambler named [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] began to frequent [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]]. Conspiring with [[Lobot/Legends|Lobot]], who wanted the corrupt Raynor out of office, Ymile devised a plan to make Dominic lose ownership of Cloud City so that they could see the rest of the galaxy. In a high-stakes [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] game with [[Barpotomous Drebble/Legends|Barpotomous Drebble]], another patron of the Cloud City casino, Ymile used a [[Skifter/Legends|skifter]] placed inside a pendant on her neck to allow Calrissian to win. As Ymile left the casino, a thief named [[Zlato]] stole her pendant and began to flee before Calrissian trapped the robber in his cape. In a brief discussion, Lando returned the pendant to Ymile and dubbed her his \"Lady Luck.\"\n\nCalrissian's extraordinary luck caused Raynor to take interest, and he challenged Calrissian to a game. However, his luck ran out, as Drebble, seeking his revenge, used another skifter within the dealer's deck to give the game to Raynor. Lando prepared to leave, but suddenly an unexpected gift of five million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] was placed in his lap. Ymile was overjoyed at this turn of events, and used her skifter once more to help Calrissian win an easy victory and claim ownership of Cloud City. Ymile thanked the gambler for his hospitality and left the city with Raynor.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|3|Lady Luck (comic)|Lady Luck}} {{1st}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/fiction/f20080522/index.html|text=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|int=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-lando-calrissian-idiots-array.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}} {{Mo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Ymile\n|de=Ymile\n|pl=Ymile\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
