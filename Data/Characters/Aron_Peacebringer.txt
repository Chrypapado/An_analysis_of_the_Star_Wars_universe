A bond has been forged between living and dead. A price is demanded of the victor&mdash;the terrible awareness that he or she or it has taken the rarest and most precious thing in all creation: a ''sentient'' life. I was twelve years old when I made my first such kill, and on that day I swore I would bring the killing on Shiva to an end! The Concordat of Peace forged between my Calian Confederacy and the Twelve Tribes&mdash;led by my non-human blood brother K\u00e9ral Longknife&mdash;fulfilled that dream. I would brave the eternal pit and all its devils before letting Sk'ar&mdash;or anyone&mdash;destroy it!|Aron Peacebringer|Star Wars (1977) 54}}\n'''Aron Peacebringer''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Shiva IV]], who ascended to the title of [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] of the [[Calian Confederacy]] and helped end generations of warfare on his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. Shiva IV had previously known little other than constant warfare between the [[Calian Confederacy]] and the [[Twelve Tribes of T'Syri\u00e9l]], and growing up amidst this conflict, Peacebringer began his martial career at the age of twelve. His first [[Death/Legends|kill]] was enough to convince him that, far from a noble pastime, war was a brutal affair that had to be ended. Aron, as he was known, pursued political success, eventually becoming the leader of the Calian Confederacy in [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]]. As the Warlord, he immediately sought dialogue with [[K\u00e9ral Longknife]], the [[Demarch]] of the Twelve Tribes, and together the two signed the [[Concordat of Peace]], bringing an end to the fighting on Shiva IV for the first [[Time/Legends|time]] in its peoples' memory.\n\nFor that, he gained the surname Peacebringer and became [[blood brother]]s with Longknife. He and Longknife together ruled the peaceful world, enforcing the peace on those who attempted to revive the old ways. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], while investigating the destruction of the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[K'avor]], Peacebringer stumbled across the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] leader [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who had crashed on the planet and was being attacked by violent outcasts. Peacebringer rescued the woman and brought her to his palace, where he developed a strong infatuation with her.\n\nThe result strained his relationship with his beloved longtime [[Marriage/Legends|wife]], [[Alisande]], but before Peacebringer could sort out his feelings, he and Organa were captured by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[General/Legends|General]] [[Bentilais san Sk'ar]], who was intent on conquering Shiva IV. Peacebringer and Organa fought, escaped, and [[Death/Legends|killed]] Sk'ar with the aid of several Rebel allies who arrived to recover Organa. On seeing the woman who had captured his heart embrace [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], Peacebringer realized he could never have her love and, letting his attraction pass, returned to his wife and newly secure world a confident man.\n\n==Biography==\n===Peacebringer===\n{{Quote|The world is old and tired, and its history is written in blood.

For the first [[Time/Legends|time]] in the Shivan collective memory, peace descended on Shiva IV, and Aron gained the surname Peacebringer. He brought an end to the death cults of the Calian war [[God/Legends|gods]], killing their priests and ending their worship&mdash;an act that stirred some controversy among his subjects. Not all accepted the peace, and some outcasts continued to raid the peaceful civilizations. Over the next year, Peacebringer received disturbing reports that the outcasts were being gathered and trained into an [[Army/Legends|army]] in the [[Drylands]].<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" />\n\n===Encounter with an offworlder===\n{{Quote|With the moons down, Milord, we can't see very well.

Reports from those nearby indicated that there had been a massive flash of light at the time communications were cut off. The Warlord took Longknife, Delois, and [[Jain Havero]] on the three-[[Standard day/Legends|day]] journey to K'avor to ascertain the truth himself. On the second night, at the [[Fire/Legends|campfire]] with his men, he heard a shot. His party rushed to investigate and found a group of T'Syri\u00e9l outcasts attacking a woman&mdash;the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] Princess [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who had crashed on the world during a mission to investigate [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] activity in the area. Though he was unsure of the enemy's numbers, Peacebringer rushed to save the woman, counting on the darkness to help his men present the image of an army. When mounted outrider reinforcements arrived, Peacebringer took them on himself, putting the outcasts to flight. Still, Peacebringer was disturbed that his four-man party, the best warriors on Shiva IV, had such difficulty with the band of outcasts, who were better trained and armed than usual.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" />\n\nPeacebringer turned his attention to the woman, whose [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] speech he could not comprehend; she in turn could not understand the [[Calian language|Calian]] that Peacebringer and his companions spoke. Peacebringer was able to get across his name and learned in turn that hers was Leia. He took the mysterious woman with him as he continued his quest, teaching her Calian in the back seat of his [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] [[Calian flier|transport]]. On reaching K'avor, they found the surrounding ground had the appearance of polished [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Glass/Legends|glass]], blue flames above the city and both the city and its inhabitants reduced to ash. Organa, recognizing the effects of the [[Cherenkov effect]] and knowing that the city was likely highly radioactive, gestured for Peacebringer to avoid entering the city on risk of death. Peacebringer trusted her warning and turned away.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" />\n\nReturning to his capital, Peacebringer sent his agents across the planet, seeking to determine the cause of K'avor's destruction. [[Standard week/Legends|Weeks]] passed without an answer, and rumors stirred that the war gods were taking their revenge on the heretic Peacebringer. The Warlord began to feel that someone was fueling the rumors while plotting a coup against him. Just as disturbingly to Peacebringer, he found his mind turning to Organa, fascinated by her beauty, courage, and exotic nature. He did not cease to love his wife, but he felt a growing passion for Organa that left him confused and guilty. Though Organa, having learned fluent Calian, tried to speak to him, he avoided her, fearful of what might result from another encounter; it was through intermediaries that he learned that she was an emissary from the Alliance to Restore the Republic, battling the Galactic Empire beyond the bounds of Shiva IV, who had crashed on a mission to investigate the world.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" />\n\n===Capture===\n{{Quote|We will fight you, Sk'ar, and make you rue the day you ever set eyes on my world!|Aron Peacebringer, to Bentilais san Sk'ar|Star Wars (1977) 53}}\n[[File:Aron-ladies.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Peacebringer, between Organa and Alisande]]\nThe night before a gala at his palace celebrating one year since the signing of the Concordat of Peace, a [[Standard month/Legends|month]] after Organa's rescue, Alisande told Peacebringer of Organa's reports of a Galactic Empire, dominating the wider galaxy and eager for conquest, likely responsible for the destruction of K'avor&mdash;devastation beyond the power of Shiva IV's [[Technology level|technology]]. At his wife's urging, he spoke with Organa, trying to keep his mind off his attraction to her. At the party, he remained consumed by fears for the future of the peace he and Longknife had forged. Alisande noticed his jealousy of Delois's shared dance with Organa, but rather than rebuke him, she acknowledged that it was merely Human to be tempted. She urged him caution and wisdom in his choices, showing confidence in his judgment.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" />\n\nStill, after he danced with his wife, they did not sneak away for a romantic encounter as they normally did; instead, they separated, full of doubt. When Organa broke away from Delois and fled to a balcony, Peacebringer held his friend back and went to speak with Organa himself. She was upset that she had not yet been rescued by the Rebel Alliance and tearful at the [[Destruction of Alderaan|loss]] of her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], of which Illyriaq\u00fcm's stately courts reminded her. Peacebringer attempted to comfort her over Alderaan's destruction, but while he did so the pair were ambushed by T'Syri\u00e9l [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], who had been trained by the Empire. Caught unaware, Peacebringer was knocked unconscious before he realized he was in danger.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" />\n\nFlown away from his capital to a [[Sk'ar's hidden base|hidden Imperial base]], Peacebringer awoke in chains and was brought before [[General/Legends|General]] [[Bentilais san Sk'ar]], the [[Commanding officer/Legends|commander]] of the Imperial force dedicated to conquering Shiva IV. He quickly realized that the outcasts had been organized by the Empire and remained defiant in the face of the massive [[Kaleesh/Legends|Kaleesh]] general.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" /> Sk'ar explained his plans to enslave the inhabitants of Shiva IV as Imperial [[Shock trooper/Legends|shock troops]], and Delois revealed himself as a traitor, aiding Sk'ar in exchange for rule of Shiva IV. Delois bragged of the plan to kill all those gathered in Illyriaq\u00fcm, destroying the world government, and creating chaos into which Sk'ar and Delois would step in as conquerors. Peacebringer was chilled by the callous betrayal of the man who had been his close friend and lieutenant and was his own [[Blood/Legends|blood]].<ref name=\"Starfire Rising\" />\n\n===Battling the Empire===\n{{Quote|By the way, whatever weapons you may have&hellip;I suggest you draw them.|Aron Peacebringer, to Leia Organa|Star Wars (1977) 54}}\nWhile he and Organa were led away, Peacebringer signaled the Rebel princess and staged a diversion, allowing Organa to take the offensive against their guards. The Calian Warlord had to fight for his own life and saw only glimpses of Organa's struggle with a [[Knife/Legends|knife]]-wielding attacker. When it seemed that she had been killed, Peacebringer went mad, falling into a Calian [[Ryastraad|battle madness]] that amplified his strength, letting him break his fetters and slay the entire [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of guards. On reaching Organa, he found that she was safe, her assailant having just narrowly missed her before she turned the knife against the [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]].<ref name=\"Starfire Rising\" />\n\n[[File:Aron_peacebringer.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Peacebringer defends Organa as she attempts to defuse the bomb.]]\nMost of the base's forces were away on the mission to destroy Illyriaq\u00fcm, allowing the pair to steal a [[Transport/Legends|transport]] and escape without major incident. Organa piloted the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] through Sk'ar's [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE]] defenses and onto the [[Calian aerial battleship|airship]] that Sk'ar was using to make his attack. Peacebringer and Organa fended off masses of stormtroopers before evading their would-be captors and fleeing into the anonymity of the vast aerial [[Battleship/Legends|battleship]]. They stalked to the location of the [[Bomb/Legends|bomb]] Sk'ar planned to drop on Peacebringer's beloved capital, and the warrior stood guard as Organa attempted to disarm it. Delois injured Organa in a surprise attack from above but was brought low by the arrival of Rebel reinforcements&mdash;[[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], two of Organa's closest brothers-in-arms&mdash;along with Longknife. While Organa successfully disarmed the bomb, Peacebringer and his newfound allies held off the Imperials. As Sk'ar attempted to escape, Chewbacca brought down his flier with a hurled gun mount, killing the would-be conqueror of Shiva IV. When he saw Organa instinctively celebrate with Skywalker rather than himself, Peacebringer realized that Leia did not love him and never would; that revelation allowed him to accept that he could live without her.<ref name=\"Starfire Rising\" />\n\nIn the aftermath, Peacebringer rallied his forces to eliminate the remainder of the Kaleesh general's troops and rooted out Delois's conspiratorial party from his court within six days. Once he felt secure, the Warlord threw a ball in honor of the world's successful defense, at which Alisande put the matter of Organa behind them, with Peacebringer confident in his relationship with his wife. However, the ball was interrupted by the arrival of an Imperial [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]].

Their relationship grew stronger with age and remained lively, with formal dances frequently ending in escapes to a secluded alcove for a passionate embrace.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" />\n\nHowever, when Leia Organa arrived, Peacebringer found himself enraptured. Though he still loved his wife and wished to remain loyal to her, he could not deny his strong attraction to Organa.

She did not condemn him but instead warned him that though his attraction was natural, he should think well before taking any rash actions.<ref name=\"The Last Gift From Alderaan\" /> The matter was resolved when Peacebringer realized Organa did not and would not love him and was able to end the hold she had on his emotions.
