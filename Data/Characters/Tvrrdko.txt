After [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] was executed during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] and Chewbacca was captured, Tvrrdko sold him to a [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] slaver named [[Ssoh]]. In one Ssoh's ships cells, Chewbacca allied with other Wookiees, took over the ship, and brutally maimed Ssoh. Around that time, he rescued Wookiee children that belonged to Tvrrdko's clan, ending the feud between them. Tvrrdko showed his gratefulness to Chewbacca by carving a portrait of Chewbacca into a large [[Wroshyr tree/Legends|Wroshyr tree]] on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] after the famous Wookiee's [[Death/Legends|death]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Chewbacca (2000) 1|''Chewbacca'' (2000) 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Chewbacca (2000) 2|''Chewbacca'' (2000) 2]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|12|WOO3, ''Wookiees''}} {{C|as Turrdko}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|106|Han Solo: The Early Years}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tvrrdko\n|es=Tvrrdko\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
