Couldn't let you go around thinking that was sensible behavior.|Jarael, to Zayne Carrick|Knights of the Old Republic 6}}\n'''Jarael''', [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] '''Edessa''', was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] [[Arkanian Offshoot/Legends|Offshoot]]. She always was hot-tempered with eyes and hands like [[Human/Legends|Humans]] and pointed ears, bearing [[Tattoo/Legends|tattoos]] that were known as the [[Flames of the Crucible]] bearing the name \"Jarael\" in the ancient language of the [[The Crucible|Crucible]] meaning \"protector.\" She was a fierce fighter who demonstrated an extreme loyalty to Camper and her other allies; normally armed with a [[shockstaff]], she was a tough opponent when fending off enemies, whether they be [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] or [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]].\n\nBefore taking the name Jarael, Edessa was a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]], then slaver after besting the [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] [[Chantique]], of the Crucible, where she attempted to help the slaves survive and succeed in their training to prevent them from being sent off to far worse conditions. A former scientist of [[The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania]], named [[Gorman Vandrayk]] or \"Camper,\" assisted in her escape from the Crucible for which she dedicated her life to protecting him.\n\nJarael and Camper eventually settled on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] in the [[Lower City]], living out of a garbage hauler, [[The Last Resort (starship)|''The Last Resort'']]. She became a traveling companion to the fugitive [[Zayne Carrick]] after he was framed for the [[Padawan Massacre|Padawan Massacre of Taris]]. Along with the criminal [[Marn Hierogryph]], the four attempted to evade capture by the [[Taris Civil Authority]] and the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] until Zayne turned himself in to save them. As the Jedi were about to pass sentence, Jarael rescued Zayne, touched by his sacrifice. The four, including a recovered [[LB-series bulk-loading droid|bulk-lifter]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]] called \"[[T1-LB|Elbee]],\" escaped Taris, and went into hiding from the Jedi as the Mandalorian Wars erupted and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] found itself engaged in a devastating conflict.\n\nHowever, after Camper fell ill, Jarael was forced to take him to Arkania, to the businessman [[Arkoh Adasca]]. Adasca, however, had other plans for both Jarael and Camper, and blackmailed Camper into serving him, while Jarael was helpless to stop the mad Arkanian. As Adasca sought more power from both Mandalorians and representatives of the Republic, the timely trap sprung by Zayne Carrick and other individuals stopped his plans. However, the weapon Adasca was bargaining with, creatures known as [[Exogorth/Legends|exogorths]], forced Camper to lead them away from the Republic and known space. With the loss of Camper, Jarael traveled with Zayne Carrick to help him confront his notorious Jedi Masters and to clear his name.\n\nAfter the Covenant had been uncovered and both Zayne and Marn Hierogryph's names were cleared of the crime, Jarael turned to assisting the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] scientist \"Demagol,\" her former teacher Antos Wyrick&mdash;disguised as the runaway [[Rohlan Dyre]], Hierogryph and Zayne in their money making schemes in the midsts of the Mandalorian Wars. During these adventures, Jarael's previously dormant Force sensitivity appeared to be blossoming. After Zayne had a confrontation with the Crucible and believed that she was called the \"destroyer,\" Jarael and Wyrick went off on their own to hunt down the Crucible back on Osadia.\n\nAfter a duel with the now more powerful and Force aware Chantique, Zayne arrived to stop the fight and help Jarael escape. Wyrick was revealed to be the mad scientist Demagol and Jarael's Force sensitivity was discovered to be only minimal. Chantique and Wyrick attacked each other and both perished in the fight. With her past behind her and the Crucible in disarray with the loss of Chantique, Jarael returned to Coruscant with Zayne to be reunited with her previously lost parents, found by the real Rohlan Dyre. Jarael remained on Coruscant to get to know her new family while beginning an intimate relationship with Zayne.\n\n==Biography==\n===A peculiar childhood===\n====Pupil in the Osadia School====\n{{Quote|I failed you&mdash;and everybody else at the school. We're not just your teachers&mdash;we're your protectors.|Antos Wyrick to Jarael, twenty-five years after her kidnapping|Knights of the Old Republic 48}}\n[[File:Edessa's_parents.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Edessa as a baby, with her parents and Antos Wyrick]]\nFollowing the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], the [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] scientist [[Demagol|Antos Wyrick]] discovered [[DNA/Legends|DNA]] belonging to the late [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]]. However, Wyrick could not make use of the discovery without proper facilities. As such, Wyrick reestablished contact with the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] bent on avenging themselves after their defeat in the Sith War. Along with [[Arkanian Offshoot/Legends|Arkanian Offshoots]] whom were purged of the [[Arkania/Legends|Arkanian]] [[University/Legends|universities]] by the [[House of Adasca|Adasca family]], Wyrick and his researchers established a research colony on the uncharted [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Osadia]]&mdash;far from the prying eyes of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]&mdash;in an attempt to create a race of [[Mandalorian Knights]] from the cells of Arca Jeth. At first, the [[New Generation Project|project]] was unstable and unsuccessful, with Wyrick unable to make [[Cloning/Legends|clones]] of Jeth. Nor could a pure Arkanian be produced, until he discovered that Jeth had not been a pure Arkanian but one who had [[Sephi/Legends|Sephi]] blood. The mixture made it impossible to introduce Jeth's DNA into the test tube growing organisms. However, the Arkanian Offshoots were discovered to be able to adapt to the introduction of the DNA in vitro. A [[Edessa's father|male]] and a [[Edessa's mother|female]] Arkanian Offshoot researchers were the first to successfully grow a child with Arca Jeth's DNA. The child was a girl whom would be called Edessa, or \"triumph\" in old [[Arkanian (language)/Legends|Arkanian]].<ref name=\"k16\" /><ref name=\"k48\" />\n\nWith the success of Edessa, more children bearing the DNA of Arca Jeth were created. Wyrick fashioned his research facility&mdash;which was purposefully made to resemble [[Arca Jeth's praxeum]] on Arkania&mdash;into a [[New Generation Academy|school]] for the children, who were all physically talented. During her brief childhood as a student, Edessa developed a strong relationship with Wyrick and became his best student, or, as he put it, his \"triumph.\" However, Wyrick began dealing with a massive [[Slavery/Legends|slaving]] organization called [[the Crucible]] to obtain [[Parent/Legends|parents]] for his test tube grown children. The Crucible then attacked the school while Wyrick was traveling off-world, reporting his progress to [[Mandalore the Ultimate]].<ref name=\"k48\" /> Led by [[Dace Golliard]] using [[Skyreaper drone]]s, the organization burned the school and took the settlers on the planet as slaves. While adults attempted to protect her and the other children, Edessa was forced to run from the drones on her own until Golliard found her and nicknamed her \"snow-hair,\" ironically as snow flakes began to fall. Unaware of his identity, Edessa took Golliard's hand and went with him to become a slave of the Crucible.<ref name=\"k44\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 44|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 44]]</ref> Upon returning to his school, Wyrick discovered it pillaged and the students gone. He launched a quest to find Edessa, but nearly twenty-five [[Standard year/Legends|years]] would pass before he saw her again. Wyrick's researchers then broke off their connections with him due to the loss of what were essentially their children.<ref name=\"k48\" />\n\n====Member, then fugitive of the Crucible====\n{{Quote|They're just searching is all&mdash;searching for ''you''.

Here, she realized the slaves who had lost their matches were not being set free but rather sent off to mine on comets, such as the ones in the Koornacht Cluster or to corrupt medical researchers.<ref name=\"k43\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 43|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 43]]</ref><ref name=\"k42\" /> She then began to help the younger slaves from failing and shipped off.<ref name=\"k42\" /> The slaves under her guidance granted her the name \"Jarael\"&mdash;meaning \"protector\" in the Crucible language&mdash;which she took on as her new name.<ref name=\"k46\" />\n\nAt some point, Jarael could not take being part of the Crucible anymore. She met an older Arkanian called Camper who helped her escape.<ref name=\"k42\" /> Jarael stowed away with a merchant the Crucible had done business with and fled.<ref name=\"k46\" /> Out of gratitude, she began traveling and protecting him in an attempt to return the favor. She also hoped that no one would know the meaning of the [[Flames of the Crucible|marks]] [[the Crucible]] placed on her. Eventually, the two wanderers ended up on the planet Taris, hiding in a dump in the Lower City district known as [[Junk Junction]], and living in an old ship known as [[The Last Resort (starship)|''The Last Resort'']].<ref name=\"k4\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 4|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 4]]</ref> The pair deliberately avoided contact with the gangs that inhabited the Lower City, such as the [[Hidden Beks|Hidden Bek]] gang and the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]]. Jarael worked from day to day as a scrap hauler for a [[Kedorzhan]] [[reclamation plant]], though that eventually closed and the pair turned to selling items Camper had fixed for credits. ''The Last Resort'' was kept on top of an old abandoned apparel warehouse, and while growing up, she would frequently play \"dress-up\" to pass the otherwise boring and tiring time.<ref name=\"khb\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]''</ref>\n\n===On the run===\n{{Quote|I'd say, 'Welcome to my life.' But, oh wait. You ruined that!|Jarael, to Zayne Carrick|Knights of the Old Republic 5}}\nFollowing the [[Padawan Massacre of Taris]], Zayne Carrick and Marn Hierogryph sought the aid of Camper, but the two were nearly killed by Jarael, who proved quite adept in fighting with a [[shockstaff]]. Jarael ordered them both to leave immediately, and not return&mdash;she was afraid that the Republic would follow Carrick's trail directly to them and discover their hiding place. Meanwhile, the Padawan Massacre incident had caused [[Lhosan Industries]] to announce their pullout from Taris, financially ruining many people in the Lower City. Frustrated and annoyed by Jarael's demeanor, Carrick referred to her as \"Darth Sunshine.\" Even so, when an arrest party arrived at Junk Junction, she and Camper helped Carrick and Hierogryph flee aboard ''The Last Resort''.<ref name=\"k3\" />\n\nBeing chased by the Jedi, as well as the Taris Civil Authority, the ragtag group fled into a nearby asteroid field. While Jarael wanted to shove Gryph out the airlock for dragging them out of the Lower City and into the forces of the Civil Authority, he batertered that they were in this together until they manage to get out of the system. Jarael reluctantly agreed and dropped the Snivvian. While Camper had a dizzy spell and Jarael went to assist him, Zayne attempted to fly out of the asteroid field to make a holographic transmission to Master [[Vandar Tokare]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine.]] When Zayne attempted to explain what happened to the small Jedi, Jarael arrived in time to knock Zayne unconscious with her shockstaff and fly ''The Last Resort'' back into the asteroid field where they could avoid further detection. While the pair were forced to pry Gryph from a large pile of environmental suits, Zayne realized they were directly on top of the [[Rogue moon]], the site of the former Padawans' last training exercise. Jarael accompanied him to the surface of the moon, where they discovered the remains of T1-LB, the Jedi's bulk-loader droid, just before Jedi Master [[Lucien Draay]] discovered them.<ref name=\"k4\" /> Thanks to ''The Last Resort''{{'s}} repaired weapon systems, it scattered the Civil Authority forces and allowed for Jarael and Zayne to escape with the remains of T1-LB.<ref name=\"k5\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 5|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 5]]</ref>\n\nInside the battered droid, thanks to repairs made by Camper, Carrick and Jarael found a recording that revealed that the Jedi Masters had received a vision of a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] in red armor, killing Jedi and destroying cities across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. The hologram was cut off when it was revealed that T1-LB or simply \"Elbee\" was [[Telekinesis/Legends|pushed]] off the cliff side by Lucien Draay. Soon after the revelation of the Jedi Master's vision, ''The Last Resort'' was attacked by the bounty hunter vessel ''[[Oroko]]'' and trapped by its [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]].<ref name=\"k5\" />\n\n[[File:Jaraelprettyface.jpg|thumb|left|Jarael rescues Zayne from the Jedi Covenant.]]\nOn board the ''Oroko'', they were detained by the bounty hunter [[Valius Ying]]. However, due to Marn Hierogryph's bartering, all but Zayne were allowed to go free&mdash;the price on Carrick's head was far too high to ignore. On Gryph's suggestion, Zayne pretended to leave with the bounty hunters, but sneaked away and tried to reach ''The Last Resort''. Zayne, though, was surprised to find Jarael patiently waiting for him. She immediately told him to stop running away, and that, by giving himself up, he would save the lives of his friends. Feeling defeated, Zayne tossed his lightsaber to Jarael, and decided to give up himself to the bounty hunters in order to stop the dark prophecy from coming true&mdash;doing this, he reasoned, would also save his friends from any persecution.<ref name=\"k5\" />\n\nAs Zayne finally stood before his former Masters, blaster fire rocked the [[Jedi Tower|Jedi Temple]]. Touched by Zayne's sacrifice, Jarael had disguised herself as the Sith Lord which had appeared in the Masters' vision and crashed into the Council chambers, fit with audio and helmet trick. After threatening the Masters with Zayne's lightsaber, she revealed herself to Zayne. While Lucien ordered the Masters to take her down, she used the suit's rocket thrusters to launch her and Zayne onto the rooftop where ''The Last Resort'' hovered. Due to the efforts of Jarael, Gryph, Camper and Elbee, Zayne was able to escape Taris and avoid being wrongly convicted of a crime he did not commit.<ref name=\"k6\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 6|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 6]]</ref>\n\n===Mandalorian prisoner===\n{{Quote|This is payback, isn't it? I posed as a Jedi and now this is Zayne's Force getting back at me!|Jarael|Knights of the Old Republic 8}}\nFollowing ''The Last Resort''{{'s}} escape from Taris, the team of fugitives fled to the mining colony on [[Vanquo]]. Low on supplies, the team devised a plan to steal what supplies they could from the miners there. While Zayne disguised himself as a refugee to get into close contact with the head of the mining staff, Jarael disguised herself again as a Jedi&mdash;this time as one of the Jedi Covenant's members, the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] [[Q'Anilia]]. In a holographic transmission on the miners distress channel, hijacked by Camper, to the miners, \"Q'Anilia\" reported that the Mandalorians were invading Vanquo. Though the miners were initially skeptical of the transmission, Zayne used a [[Mind trick/Legends|Jedi mind trick]] to convince them that the Mandalorian Invasion was in fact real and they should abandon their camp. Distracted by Vanquo's scenery&mdash;its trees, mountains and skyline, far different than the Taris scenery in the Undercity that she had become accustomed to, Jarael began to hone her lightsaber skills, finding it fun, while Zayne and Gryph gathered the supplies.<ref name=\"k7\" />\n\n[[File:Jarequanil.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Jarael, disguised as Q'Anilia, is surrounded by Mandalorians.]]\nAgainst all odds, the Mandalorians [[Battle of Vanquo|attacked]] Vanquo under the command of Mandalorian [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Rohlan Dyre]]. Distracted by her practicing with Zayne's lightsaber, Jarael quickly found herself surrounded by the Mandalorians. Vastly outnumbered, Jarael attempted to break free was soon overwhelmed, captured and dragged off to a [[teroch-type gunship]].<ref name=\"k7\" /> Despite her protests of not being a Jedi, her cries fell on deaf ears as they lifted off Vanquo and brought her to a former Republic research station, [[Flashpoint Stellar Research Station]]. Though still claiming not to be a Jedi, she was dragged into the facilities waiting room to join other Jedi captured by the Mandalorians on [[Suurja]].<ref name=\"k8\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 8|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 8]]</ref> These Jedi were experiments for the Mandalorian scientist known as Doctor \"Demagol\" or Demar'agol&mdash;the flesh carver&mdash;in [[Mando'a/Legends|Mando'a]].<ref name=\"k48\" /> Soon after Jarael's arrival, the Jedi known commonly as \"[[Darth Malak|Squint]]\" was tossed back into the waiting room after being experimented on by Demagol and bearing the scars to prove it. Despite the obvious pain Squint was in, he volunteered himself to take Jarael's place, knowing Jarael was not a Jedi, when Demagol stepped in and wished to make Jarael his next experiment.<ref name=\"k8\" /> Squint would only be able to keep the doctor occupied for so long. He immediately wanted to make Jarael his next test subject however when he pulled Jarael's hair away and saw her ears,<ref name=\"k8\" /> gained from Arca Jeth's DNA introduced into her during her conception, Demagol recognized her from Osadia though Jarael would remain unaware of Demagol's true identity of Antos Wyrick for months.<ref name=\"k47\" /><ref name=\"k48\" />\n\nFortunately for Jarael, the Mandalorian commander from Vanquo had attempted to desert the Mandalorians to discover the true reason behind the invasion of Republic space by stealing ''The Last Resort''. Zayne, Camper, Elbee and Gryph subdued the Mandalorian and struck a deal with him in order to rescue Jarael. Rohlan brought the \"captured\" Zayne to Flashpoint Station and insisted to Demagol that he be the next test subject due to his desire to see the young Jedi suffer for \"nearly breaking his neck\". Demagol complied with Dyre and the three exited to his laboratory. Moments later, only Dyre and Demagol came out, commenting on Zayne's apparent death in the lab. This prompted Jarael to lash out at Demagol, strangling him while keeping him tackled to the floor. Jarael heard a simply telepathic voice and released Demagol, allowing him to throw her off. Demagol, in reality a disguised Zayne, used the Force to throw mining charges on key points at the facility, with Gryph, disguised as a Republic fleet admiral, made it seem that they sabotaged Flashpoint Station. The Mandalorians, in response to the confusion, fled the station, leaving only Dyre, Carrick and the captured Jedi. The true Demagol had actually been locked inside a storage cabinet. Rohlan and Zayne freed the captured Jedi, and during the evacuation of the facility, Squint and Jarael said their goodbyes to each other&mdash;Jarael was told that the next time they met, she was to simply call him Alek. Following the evacuation of the other prisoners, Zayne and Jarael left Flashpoint station on ''The Last Resort''.<ref name=\"k10\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 10|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 10]]</ref> Unbeknown to anyone, when Rohlan Dyre left to bring Demagol out from the storage cabinet, the Zeltron doctor injected Dyre with a substance that made him weak and forced into a coma. Taking his armor, Demagol gave Dyre to the Jedi leaving Flashpoint while he himself, wishing to discover if the other children from Osadia survived, stowed away on ''The Last Resort'' under the guise of Rohlan Dyre.<ref name=\"k48\" />\n\n===A bounty===\n{{Quote|We're here to resolve a problem, but I guess I was expecting some kind of an office.|Jarael posing as \"Chantique\"|Knights of the Old Republic 11}}\n[[File:Chantique.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Jarael posing as \"Chantique\" on Telerath&mdash;fighting the Moomo Brothers]]\nFollowing their escape from Flashpoint Station, Jarael and Camper had problems to solve on the banking world of [[Telerath/Legends|Telerath]]. Disguised as high level officials, the pair was expecting an office type world with large cities and a bleak, impersonal atmosphere&mdash;however, what they found was a beautiful resort planet with beaches, warm weather, and a relaxed environment, where they were greeted by the droid [[GG-36]]. Jarael and Camper were lacking of funds&mdash;fortunately, Gryph had a perfectly legal bank account on Telerath. The pair disguised themselves as \"Baron Hyro Margryph\" and \"Chantique\". Jarael explained how the bank administration must have mistaken the baron for the fugitive Marn Hierogryph, and as a result, froze the account. After a brief validation process, the account was reopened and they were allowed to collect the funds. However, while observing the beautiful scenery with the banker, they were intercepted by the [[Moomo Brothers]], a pair of second-rate bounty hunters. During their attack, Jarael displayed amazing fighting prowess as she defended Camper. However, the two bounty hunters quickly made off with the banker who had assisted Jarael in reopening the account. The banker, as it turned out, was none other than [[Arvan Carrick]], Zayne Carrick's father.<ref name=\"k11\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 11|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 11]]</ref>\n\nThe Moomo Brothers were contracted by Master [[Raana Tey]] to observe and watch Arvan and his family in case Zayne decided to make contact with them. Once Zayne had made contact with his family, the Moomo Brothers were then to contact Raana and allow her and the other Masters to take control of the situation. However, the Moomos had a history of being third rate bounty hunters, and decided to go against Raana's orders and capture Arvan instead of merely watching him&mdash;their reason being that it was less boring, and that it made more sense to them, and therefore, more sense overall. Raana expressed her anger to the two bounty hunters and advised them that she would have to consult the other Masters to see what should be done. Meanwhile, Camper, Zayne and Gryph developed a plan which allowed them to rescue Arvan&mdash;Gryph convinced [[Dob Moomo|Dob]], one of the Moomos, that Zayne was on the planet and was willing to trade his life for Arvan's. Gryph and Dob negotiated a trade, since Dob believed that this was a better deal for Raana. When Gryph arrived with a hooded Jedi, who was in fact Camper, Zayne secretly infiltrated the Moomos' ship and rescued his father from the two bounty hunters. Jarael personally refused to disguise herself as a Jedi to rescue Arvan, since the debacle which had led to her being previously captured by the Mandalorians. Once Arvan was rescued he helped transfer the money needed by both Gryph and Zayne.<ref name=\"k12\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 12|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 12]]</ref>\n\n===Trip to Arkania===\n{{Quote|Welcome to Arkania. Bet you wished you stayed wherever it is you were!|Zadawi, to Jarael|Knights of the Old Republic 16}}\n[[File:JaraelWhipsNChains-KOTOR14.jpg|thumb|right|Jarael attacks HK-24.]]\nFollowing the rescue of the banker Arvan, Jarael, Camper and T1-LB decided to part ways with Zayne and Gryph. Upon their departure Jarael informed Zayne of her admiration for his integrity despite his being a notoriously hunted man. She wished him luck in finding what he was looking for, and concluded with telling him that she wanted [[May the Force be with you/Legends|the Force to be with him]].<ref name=\"k13\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 13|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 13]]</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Camper's past caught up with him, and Jarael was faced with an assassin droid by the designation [[HK-24 series assassin droid|HK-24]]. After T1-LB was incapacitated by the assassin droid, Jarael fought HK-24 herself, only to be beaten by it. The fortunate reappearance of Demagol (disguised as Rohlan Dyre), who had been hiding in one of the ship's smuggling compartments, managed to incapacitate the assassin droid and save Jarael's life.<ref name=\"k14\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 14|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 14]]</ref>\n\nHowever, during the fight, Camper had been injured by the HK unit and the injury caused him to have a serious \"spell\", much worse than anything previously experienced by him&mdash;Camper had always been prone to these \"spells\" during stressful situations which caused him to go into a coma-like state where he was totally unresponsive to those around him. Demagol treated what physical wounds Camper had suffered but to help him, Jarael needed to take ''The Last Resort'' to [[Arkania/Legends|Arkania]], the homeworld of the Arkanians, where she had to find a cure&mdash;despite the fact that hybrids like her and Camper were despised by \"pure\" Arkanians.<ref name=\"k16\" />\n\nWhile in [[Adascopolis]], disguised by using heavy clothing and goggles, Jarael attempted to find help for Camper. However, she was immediately discovered to be an off-shoot Arkanian and forced to leave the city&mdash;in the process, Jarael met a young Arkanian off-shoot named [[Zadawi]]. Zadawi explained to Jarael the plight of the other off-shoots, who were being forced to work in mining camps. Zadawi took Jarael to her grandmother that night where she was made to feel welcome. However, her grandmother felt ill after she and Jarael had a disagreement concerning Adascorp.<ref name=\"k16\" />\n\nJarael, though, still required help getting medical attention to Camper. With Zadawi's assistance, she more effectively disguised herself as a true-blood Arkanian with claw-fingered gloves, blank-eye lenses, and blush. While attempting to get help, the civil authority of Adascopolis was immediately called in to apprehend her due to her giving doctors the blood-sample of an offshoot. Jarael kept several of the guards at bay, but was eventually taken prisoner by Lord [[Arkoh Adasca]] himself. Jarael called Camper and Rohlan, and told them that Adasca had offered to help them with regards to Camper.<ref name=\"k16\" />\n\n===Arkoh Adasca's prisoner===\n{{Quote|This is the worst dinner I've ever had.|Jarael, regarding Adasca's revelation of his plans|Knights of the Old Republic 18}}\n[[File:Jaraelarkanianlegacy.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Jarael, Adasca's dinner guest]]\nCamper was immediately taken in for treatment and Jarael found herself in the care of Lord Adasca. Adasca informed Jarael of Camper's previous status as a promising worker for Adascorp until he caught the [[Balinquar's Virus]] and ran away. Jarael was given the treatment of royalty during her stay on the ''[[Arkanian Legacy]]''. However, Adasca and one of his workers, [[Eejee Vamm]], kept the truth from her concerning Camper's condition&mdash;he, in fact, did not have any virus. Her stay on the ''Arkanian Legacy'' was just a ploy to get Camper to finish the project he had started for Adascorp before he ran away.<ref name=\"k17\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 17|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 17]]</ref>\n\nJarael proceeded to act as a prisoner to Arkoh Adasca without her even knowing that she was, indeed, an actual prisoner. Eejee Vamm continued to play on the story of Camper having the Balinquar's Virus by displaying images of him in the quarantine on board the ''Arkanian Legacy''. Adasca also kept up the illusion of himself being the benevolent businessman by sympathizing with her over her and Camper's life conditions. Despite Jarael being an offshoot, the pure blooded Adasca found himself attracted to the woman and invited her for dinner in the ''Arkanian Legacy''{{'s}} observatory.<ref name=\"k17\" />\n\nAs Jarael ate dinner with Adasca, he informed her of his plans to ensure that the true blooded race of Arkanians was able to expand and thrive&mdash;starting with Jarael's future children, a notion which she found to be unpleasantly abrupt. Adasca told her that he wanted to put Arkania at the center of the galaxy and of his plans to use the mysterious creatures known as [[Exogorth/Legends|exogorths]] to accomplish this. Adasca informed her what he knew of the creatures who seemingly devoured everything metal and mineral and how a scientist named Gorman Vandrayk had discovered a way to control these beasts. Once the beasts were able to be controlled, then Adasca said that he would be able to implement his plan&mdash;though he refused to elaborate further for Jarael during this time. However, as a final note, which he stressed with much importance, was that this scientist was known to her as the man she protected&mdash;Camper.<ref name=\"k18\" />\n\nThe first of Adasca's other guests arrived almost immediately. What was left of [[Battle Group Serroco]], traveling in a freighter known as the ''[[Deadweight]]'', arrived at the ''Arkanian Legacy''. While Eejee Vamm suggested locking her up, Adasca thought she might have some uses greeting their guests. Jarael refused to be apart of Adasca's plans of selling off the exogorths to the highest bidder and ran from him. She was intercepted by several HK-24 units, however, but managed to destroy them in the ensuing fight.<ref name=\"k19\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 19|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 19]]</ref>\n\nHolding Adasca at gunpoint with an HK-24 blaster rifle, Adasca threatened her that he'd cut off Camper's hands if she did not comply with his orders. As she handed over the blaster rifle, the first of Adasca's guests had landed in the hangar bay. As the members of the Serroco Battle Group disembarked, Jarael spotted her old friend, Zayne Carrick. Jarael rushed over and kissed him&mdash;only as a resort to give him information of what was really occurring on the ''Arkanian Legacy'' and to Camper. Zayne was quickly taken to a secure area though Jarael begged Adasca not to allow them to take him back to Coruscant&mdash;a wish in which Adasca used again to bind Jarael to do as he says or spend the rest of her stay under the guard of HK-24 units.<ref name=\"k19\" />\n\nThe representative of the [[Revanchist|Jedi Crusaders]] arrived afterward with another of Jarael's old friends, Alek. Jarael attempted to make Alek see that Adasca was a madman but she was quickly interrupted and restrained by Adasca. While in the observatory with Adasca and his guests, showing them the exogorths, Adasca's final guest arrived. The guest was none other than [[Mandalore the Ultimate]]&mdash;his arrival made it apparent to her that Adasca had also bound Demagol into his game just as he did to her.<ref name=\"k19\" />\n\n[[File:Jaraelcampergoodbye.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Jarael and Camper say good-bye to each other.]]\nDespite Adasca constantly watching her, she was able to sneak away to the observatory alcove to receive a transmission from Camper. Jarael apologized for allowing Adasca to find him. Camper told her to find ''The Last Resort'' and escape. Jarael knew she couldn't with the armed guards surrounding her but reassured Camper by informing him that Zayne and Alek were on the ''Legacy''. Adasca discovered her and ended her transmission. She resisted him, fighting him off but he managed to keep her down by striking her. Adasca, through Jarael's locater bracelet (torn from her when Adasca struck her), informed him that Jarael would become the plague designers next test subject if he didn't continue doing his work.<ref name=\"k20\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 20|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 20]]</ref>\n\nFortunately, Zayne Carrick had been able to escape and along with Demagol, Republic lieutenant [[Carth Onasi]] and Lucien Draay, whom had also been captured by Adasca, a trap was sprung and brawl took place between Republic forces and Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. Zayne managed to release Jarael of her binds and grab a guard's shockstaff and joined the brawl. Jarael, Zayne, Demagol, and Alek managed to escape the ''Arkanian Legacy''{{'s}} observation deck as the exogorths plunged into it and consumed it, killing Arkoh Adasca. The four managed to meet up with Elbee who displayed a holographic transmission from Camper. Camper informed them that he was going to take ''The Last Resort'' and lead the exogorths away into wild space. Jarael and Camper tearfully said good-bye to each other as Camper jumped into hyperspace.<ref name=\"k21\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 21|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 21]]</ref>\n\nJarael, feeling guilty for bringing Camper to Adascorp, was told by Zayne that he needed her to help him face his masters. At that moment, Lucien arrived and informed him that if he turned himself in, then he would agree to take all of them all away from the burning ''Arkanian Legacy''. Zayne agreed to these terms but another ship had arrived. ''[[Moomo Williwaw]]'' crashed inside the vessel and emerged from it was the Moomo Brothers and [[Slyssk]]. Slyssk revealed that Marn Hierogryph was still alive on Taris and sent for Zayne to help him in his resistance against the Mandalorians.<ref name=\"k21\" />\n\n===Beginning anew without Camper===\n{{Quote|I may not know what I'm supposed to do since Camper left&mdash;but everyone ''else'' seems to.|Jarael, to Zayne Carrick|Knights of the Old Republic 29}}\nJarael traveled with Zayne and the others to Taris in their new, temporary home, the ''Moomo Williwaw''.<ref name=\"khb\" /> While Zayne left the Williwaw to seek out Marn Hierogryph, Jarael, Demagol and Alek remained on board the vessel, floating amongst the Mandalorian blockade in orbit. With Camper in wild space and due to the events that had transpired at [[Omonoth]], Jarael felt a sense of loneliness and her trust in others diminished. Demagol took notice of her behavior and asked her to deal with her problems in the Mandalorian fashion&mdash;a sparring match. In the cargo hold of the Williwaw, Jarael spared with Alek and bested him. Her abilities were commented to be better then before and can still be better the more she trains.<ref name=\"k23\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 23|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 23]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Alek_and_Jarael.jpg|thumb|left|Alek is turned away by Jarael.]]\nThe match, however, brought Alek and her closer together. Alek explained that since the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]] Jedi have [[Jedi Code/Legends|refrained]] from forming such relationships, however, he still wished for a more romantic relationship with her. Jarael asked that she be given time before she pursued a relationship with anyone due to the trust that Arkoh Adasca abused. Alek was unconvinced, and told her to ask herself whether it was really just the timing or because it was just ''him'' that she did not want a relationship with.<ref name=\"k23\" />\n\nThe stay at Taris would not last long after Zayne's encounter with Raana Tey however. When the resistance base came under siege by Mandalorians, Zayne requested for Jarael, Alek and Rohlan to take two children, the children of Constable [[Noana Sowrs|Sowrs]], to their father on Alderaan with the assistance of Zayne's childhood friend, [[Shel Jelavan]]. While on Alderaan, Jarael received another message from Zayne to come to the ice planet [[Jebble]] for pickup. On arrival, they found the planet swarmed with Rakghoul-turned Mandalorians, with Zayne and Gryph at the center of it. Though rescued, Zayne ordered the Williwaw to turn around to pick up a friend of his, [[Celeste Morne]], agent for the Jedi Covenant. Before they were able to, [[Cassus Fett]] had arrived and fired off nuclear warheads, effectively wiping out the entire Mandalorian force stationed there. Jarael, Alek and Shel reassured Zayne that they could count on them to help him clear his name after he became upset by the apparent death of Celeste. First, by heading to [[Odryn]], using the key Celeste gave to Zayne.<ref name=\"k28\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 28|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 28]]</ref>\n\n===Infiltration on Odryn===\n{{Quote|Third Jedi impersonation's the charm, I guess.|Jarael|Knights of the Old Republic 29}}\nAt Odryn, Jarael disguised herself in heavy robes while donning make up and dying her white hair black to appear as human Celeste Morne. While Zayne Carrick and Marn Hierogryph stowed away in a laundry hamper, the Moomo Brothers would assist in carrying it into the [[Sanctum of the Exalted]] on Odryn to make it seem as if she was bringing an artifact&mdash;more specifically, the [[Muur Talisman]]. Upon landing, she was greeted by a native [[Feeorin/Legends|Feeorin]], [[Borjak]]. Borjak immediately noticed the accompanying Ithorians with her and informed her of the one outsider per visit rule. Jarael, disguised as Morne, dealt several blows to the much larger man and had him at the mercy of Zayne's borrowed lightsaber. Jarael managed to convince Borjak that they were simply pirates hired to carry the Talisman. He approved provided they do not enter the Sanctum itself. En route to the Sanctum, Borjak showed Jarael the troubled state of the local village and how the weather has been negatively affecting it. Borjak showed her the temple and explained how only the Exalted, the oldest Feeorin&mdash;Jedi Covenant member [[Feln]], may enter along with any guest. Before leaving her and the Moomo Brothers, he asked to tell Feln that he did his duty.<ref name=\"k29\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 29]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Jaraelcelestemorne.jpg|thumb|right|Jarael, disguised as Celeste Morne]]\nWith Borjak gone, Zayne and Gryph were released from their tight compartment and entered the Sanctum using Celeste's key. Inside, they found a storeroom full of ancient artifacts and trinkets encased in green containers embedded with [[Microtag|Covenant Identichips]]. While recording pictures of the artifacts, Zayne explained how he escaped Taris and how he thought it was nice to talk to her again while thanking her for helping him to which he asked why when Demagol wanted her to be a warrior and Alek wanting her to help against the Mandalorians. The answer simply being he asked first. Jarael and the Moomo Brothers left for the rendezvous point while Zayne and Gryph continued recording the artifacts.<ref name=\"k29\" />\n\nOnboard the ''Moomo Williwaw'', Jarael discovered that the Moomo Brothers had actually stolen several of the artifacts found in the Sanctum inside their laundry hamper. When the Williwaw returned to Odryn to pick Zayne and Gryph up, the Jedi Master, [[Feln]], believed that they were returning to raid the Sanctum again and as such, destroyed it. After the Feeorins on Odryn turned on Feln and killed him, Jarael and the Williwaw landed on the surface. While Zayne and Gryph, believing that they were at a dead end due to Feln destroying the evidence they had collected, didn't need to see the Ithorians' laundry, Jarael showed them the artifacts that they stole.<ref name=\"k30\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 30|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 30]]</ref>\n\n===Journey to the capital===\n{{Quote|Jarael&mdash;this is a fool's errand!

However, as the Williwaw approached the planet, [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]], commanding the [[Swiftsure (Inexpugnable-class)|''Swiftsure'']], took notice of the gunship's approach and deployed [[Lance Squadron]] to stop them. The Moomo Brothers sprung into action, commanding the gun turrets while Rohlan attempted to reason with Jarael on Zayne's mission, Jarael refused to listen however, stating she wanted to start her life over again by doing something and that was to help Zayne.<ref name=\"k31\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 31|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 31]]</ref>\n\nAs the Williwaw continued on its course toward Coruscant, Karath's coordinated fleet fired upon it, nearly destroying it. Zayne prepared to pull the Moomo Williwaw back when he and Jarael realized that he simply needed another ship. Jarael agreed to allow Zayne, Gryph, Slyssk and the stolen artifacts from Odryn to escape while she, Demagol and the Moomo Brothers allowed themselves to be captured though Zayne was hesitant to allow Jarael to do this for him. Demagol attempted to veer Jarael from this but she berated him and told him to go hide in a crawl space. Jarael took the Williwaw and crash landed it in the hangar of the ''Swiftsure''. Admiral Karath recognized Jarael instantly from the Arkanian Legacy and ordered his men to find Zayne and Gryph&mdash;who had already escaped to Coruscant aboard the ''[[Deadweight]]''.<ref name=\"k31\" />\n\n[[File:JaraelKarathK31.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Jarael is captured by Saul Karath.]]\nZayne and Gryph were however captured by Covenant member [[Xamar]] who brought them to masters [[Vrook Lamar]] and [[Vandar Tokare]]<ref name=\"k31\" /> where he confessed to them the true killers of the Padawan Massacre. A plan was devised to secure the headquarters of the Covenant at the [[Draay Estate]]. There, as Jedi Knights attempted to infiltrate the estate, the retainer and actual [[Sith Acolyte]] [[Haazen]] revealed himself to have been manipulating the Covenant from under [[Krynda Draay]]'s, Lucien's mother and founder of the Covenant, notice. During the encounter, the Republic fleet was taken control of by Haazen who had the fleet fire upon Coruscant to prevent the Jedi Council's Knights from storming the estate.<ref name=\"k32\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 32|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 32]]</ref> During the chaos, the entire Covenant fell apart as Xamar was killed by cruiser fire and Q'Anilia committed suicide. Krynda herself was revealed to had been trapped in stasis ever since the Padawan Massacre and died soon after her release.<ref name=\"k34\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 34|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 34]]</ref> While at first, Lucien Draay believed Marn Hierogryph to have been the cause of his mother's death, during his duel with Zayne, Lucien turned against Haazen and launched both Zayne and Gryph away from the estate as he took control of the fleet himself and destroyed Haazen, the estate and seemingly himself.<ref name=\"k35\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 35|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 35]]</ref>\n\nWhile the Republic forces and Jedi Order agreed to make the public believe the destruction was caused by the Mandalorians, Zayne and Gryph were cleared of the murders and their bounties paid off. Alek testified on their behalf during which Jarael hoped that the Jedi Council would make their peace with the crusading Jedi. In protest, Alek decided he would go under the alias of Malak until the war had ended. Jarael considered going to fight the Mandalorians with Zayne safe but decided that Demagol needed her help to find the answers in his own quest. During Saul Karath's speech regarding the supposed Mandalorian terror plot, Gryph gave Jarael Zayne's Padawan braid, wanting her to give it to him. However, Zayne turned down the offer of being promoted to a Jedi Knight and opted to partner up with Gryph while protecting the little people who slip beyond their notice.<ref name=\"k35\" />\n\n===Hierogryph's schemes===\n====Metellos 3====\n{{Quote|Only one there is, moneybags.

Despite the circumstances of losing his now-parter, Gryph created a new scam. On [[Metellos 3]], planetary exchanges were being made for a hefty sum of money. Jarael and Rohlan Dyre, with a mining ship called the ''[[Hot Prospect]]'', entered the trading floor of Metellos 3. Demagol, disguised as a disgruntled native speaking in an unidentified language, and Jarael, disguised as Brackel&mdash;the captain of the ''Hot Prospect'', stormed the area and held up the [[Chev]] [[Cipiter]]. \"Brackel\" explained how the natives of the planet [[Italbos]] were disgruntled with their planet being claimed and sold off by the auctioneers. Gryph, disguised as Gryphomarn&mdash;a professor of law, volunteered to represent the natives of Italbos in a new auction where the natives would get paid a large sum of money for their supposed mineral-riched planet.<ref name=\"k36\" />\n\nCipiter, to arrange the new auction, closed the market for the rest of the day and allowed for Brackel and her Italbos friend to stay with the professor. Without hearing word from the auctioneers, Jarael felt they were stalling though Gryph simply thought that it allowed the traders to come up with more money&mdash;money that would be transferred to the crew of the ''Hot Prospect'' though Jarael wanted to send her share of the money to friends on Arkania. While discussing Zayne Carrick's whereabouts, the trio were ambushed by a task force of Chevs utilizing [[energy bola]]s and [[Sentinel droid]]s. Demagol and Jarael managed to hold off the task force while Gryph attempted to make a get-away but was captured in the end.<ref name=\"k36\" /> Restrained with energy leashes, the two met Cipter's master, the [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] [[Nunk Plaarvin]] of the [[Raff Syndicate]]. While being led away, Jarael attempted to make an escape as she attacked [[Mongorrt]], the head of the security forces on Metellos 3. However, Plaarvin stopped the escape attempt with his massiveness and had them restrained even further.<ref name=\"k37\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 37|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 37]]</ref>\n\nThe Chevin had both Jarael and Demagol strung up in an observation tower whose glass was meant to magnify and increase the intensity of Metellos's already powerful sunlight and incinerate anyone in the room. Left to their fates by Nunk and his slaves, the companions watched as the sun began clearing the edge of the observatory's lens. As the heat built up, Demagol revealed his suspicion to Jarael that she might be Force sensitive. Having seen her spar with multiple Jedi, he encouraged her to reach out with the Force and break the chains that bound them. Despite an initial protest that she did not have the power, Jarael did her best to call upon the Force to break the chain and both her and the impostor Mandalorian believed she had broke it herself. Upon a happy reunion with Zayne, Gryph and Slyssk, after they had dealt with Nunk Plaarvin, Demagol remarked that Zayne would need to instruct Jarael in the ways of her supposed new-found powers.<ref name=\"k37\" />\n\n====The ''Chancellor Fillorean''====\n{{Quote|Wait.

Meanwhile, Jarael and the ''Hot Prospect'' came across the lost luxury vessel, the ''[[Chancellor Fillorean]]''. While exploring in the no-gravity ship, the crew discovered that all the passengers were dead save for one by the name of [[Toki Tollivar]] and his droid, [[K-OB7|Kayo]]. Toki informed Zayne and Slyssk of how everyone began to turn up dead in hyperspace and eventually he was the only one left. While Zayne left to call a Republic vessel, Jarael came across a strangled Slyssk in the galley. While Zayne was trying to use the Force to clear Slyssk's throat unsuccessfully, Jarael begged Demagol to save him. The Mandalorian scientist surgically implanted a breathing tube into Slyssk's throat. While the tube would be temporary, it would be enough to keep him alive.<ref name=\"k38\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 38|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 38]]</ref>\n\nZayne noticed Toki had been witness to the surgery. Toki claimed that he had been in his cabin to rest and sent Kayo to get his food. Zayne and Demagol rushed off to apprehend the droid servant while Jarael remained to guard Toki and Slyssk. However, while Kayo was believed to be responsible for the murders and the attempted murder of Slyssk, Toki Tolivar was the real strangler or better known in Republic space as the ''Corellian Strangler''. Toki revealed himself as a [[Sith Acolyte|Sith adept]] during the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]] as he put Jarael into a [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force Grip]]. However Toki, much like Arkoh Adasca, sensed something beyond what they saw in Jarael. This disturbance upset the [[Bimm (furred species)|Bimm]] and made his killing more enjoyable. Before he could crush Jarael's windpipe, Zayne shot Toki. The blast however did not kill him and he [[Duel on the Chancellor Fillorean|attacked]] Zayne. The Sith adept overwhelmed Zayne but the timely arrival of Kayo saved him. Kayo grabbed Toki and electrocuted him while Toki screamed remarks about the Jedi and Jarael. Demagol shot Kayo in the back, resulting in an explosion that incinerated the Bimm. He shoved Zayne and retorted that he was no use to him if he could not protect Jarael.<ref name=\"k38\" />\n\n====Pantolomin====\n{{Dialogue|Malak|You haven't told us the ''truth''.|Dyre|Of how you can do the things you can do.|Adasca|Of who you were before Camper \"saved\" you.

While witnessing one of the matches, they re-united with Marn Hierogryph, who infiltrated the arena under the alias of inspector Bulgryph Mandrake. The conman planned to use a small delay in the feed from the secondary dueling arenas to place bets on the winners before the result of the race was revealed to the audience. But much to his dismay, Zayne had entered the dueling games himself to win a replica swoop bike of his hero, [[Goethar Kleej]]. In Zayne's absence, Hierogryph entrusted Jarael to place bets while he sent her the information. However, she found herself unable to place the bets due to her being uncomfortable making wagers on brawls&mdash;for reasons even she didn't understand. While Gryph vented over his frustration with Zayne, Demagol had been spotted, thanks to his wearing of Rohlan Dyre's armor, and apprehended by security forces under the suspicions of him being one of the supposed saboteurs from the Vindication-cover up. Gryph protested and explained how Demagol's appearance was for show. Going on to explain that he was Jarael's client and she wished to sign him up for the duels.<ref name=\"k39\" />\n\n[[File:Jarael_Paparazzil.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jarael is exposed to her connection to The Crucible by Goethar Kleej.]]\nLater, while resting aboard ''[[Hot Prospect]]'', Jarael experienced a [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]]. In this vision she was back on Taris in the Jedi Tower, wearing the red spacesuit and wielding Carrick's yellow lightsaber. But instead of [[First WatchCircle|Zayne's Masters]] she saw the men who played significant role in her life over the past few months: Malak, Rohlan Dyre, Demagol and Arkoh Adasca. The four men who expressed interest in Jarael in reality, told her that the reason for that was hidden within herself, pointing to her clouded past and mysterious destiny. A moment later Zayne Carrick appeared in the vision as well, bound in chains and blaming Jarael for betraying him. A mysterious woman who held Carrick's chains told Jarael that he now belonged to her and left her at the mercy of the four men. At that moment Jarael woke up and unwillingly overheard Zayne Carrick speaking to, what appeared to be, T1-LB. Realizing that Zayne was concerned about Goethar Kleej, Jarael showed him the non-edited version of his \"retirement speech\" which Hierogryph had lifted from the broadcast center.<ref name=\"kotor40\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 40|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 40]]</ref>\n\nBack on Jervo's World, Jarael disguised herself as a blue skinned species and flirted with the composer for the games. She managed to switch his [[Data cube/Legends|data cube]] containing musical scores for the duels with one that had the full version of Goethar's speech as well as a statement by Jervo Thalien concerning the illegal funding for the duels, which exposed the slave dealings. While Thalien's attempts to kill Zayne, Demagol, Goethar and his son, [[Aubin Kleej]], went awry, the composer unknowingly played the Goethar's speech and Jervo's confession for the audience. The resulting uproar allowed for Goethar and Aubin to escape the duels in a garbage bin, while Demagol became the dueling champion and received a swoop nicknamed \"''[[Goethar Special]]''\" as a prize. After Zayne offered his service to help Jarael with her Force abilities, Goethar recognized her tattoos as being the [[Flames of the Crucible]]&mdash;worn by members of the same organization that provided the slaves for the duels. Goethar forced her away in disgust and stormed off with Aubin&mdash;telling Zayne that that a person like him would never be around someone like Jarael. Distressed, Jarael fled from the scene to her quarters aboard the ''Hot Prospect'' while Zayne went after her to ask what Goethar had meant. Jarael confessed that she was once a slaver herself before meeting Camper. Later, Jarael's bitter arch-rival and former slaver colleague, Chantique, executed Thalien and stated that she would be coming after Jarael and her friends.<ref name=\"kotor41\" />\n\n===Malak's recruitment===\n{{Quote|Everything has changed, Jarael. Everything&mdash;except you. And you're why I'm here!|Malak to Jarael|Knights of the Old Republic 42}}\nFor a time, Zayne attempted to talk to Jarael concerning her past, especially on the matter of her reasons for keeping it a secret. The crew of the ''Hot Prospect'' made its way to [[Wor Tandell/Legends|Wor Tandell]] where Zayne was going to meet up with representatives from the Republic. In that time, Jarael took to riding a [[tandreed]] in the forests in the area. During the ride, the creature stumbled and fell, throwing her off, though she was kept afloat by Zayne who was passing through. Jarael finally opened up and revealed how she ended up with the Crucible and how she attempted to help the slaves. While Zayne asked to help her in bringing the organization down, Jarael angrily returned to the ''Hot Prospect'' demanding that he simply help her run from it as she helped him during his run from the Jedi Covenant.<ref name=\"k42\" />\n\n[[File:ZayneKissesJarael.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Jarael is kissed by Zayne Carrick as a part of ruse.]]\nInstead of finding Slyssk waiting for her at the ship, she was greeted by Malak who had come to officially recruit her into the joining him against the Mandalorians and, though he tried to mask it, win her over romantically. Malak explained how the Jedi had sanctioned the war effort and hoped to recruit Jarael due to her uncanny fighting abilities. Gryph unwittingly mentioned her recently discovered Force talents which overjoyed Malak though Jarael was still unwilling to go with him. While Malak continued to try and convince her, Demagol returned and was enraged at the fact that Malak was attempting to take her away. He struck Malak and a brawl between the two began. Jarael begged Malak to stop fighting though he refused to listen and slashed Rohlan's blasters with his lightsaber, forcing Demagol's head into a campfire. Malak was only stopped when two of his own comrades, Captain [[Telettoh]] and [[Ferroh]], arrived and were forced to restrain him, along with Zayne, who accompanied them. Malak explained how he simply wanted Jarael to join him claiming that the Jedi would welcome her. Zayne could see that this was not what Jarael wanted and, in an attempt to get Malak to leave, Zayne kissed Jarael and claimed that they were in love and were going far away from the war. The ruse was successful and Malak, rejected again by Jarael, left along with Ferroh and Telettoh. Zayne later promised to Jarael to use the resources, which he acquired after the events of Vindication and that he had kept a secret from Gryph, to break the Crucible.<ref name=\"k42\" />\n\n===Breaking the Crucible===\n{{Quote|Zayne's right.

Hoping to ruin the Crucibles relationship with the Cooperative and free the slaves forced to mine [[Thorilide/Legends|thorilide]] crystals, they disguised themselves as Crucible officers. Jarael and Zayne forced the [[Koorivar/Legends|Koorivar]] officer in charge, [[Sariyah Budan]] into handing over a portion of the Cooperatives crystal harvest or else she'd be collecting the crystals herself. Budan obliged and granted the two stay in a cabin while they wait for the harvest to be transferred over to the ''Hot Prospect''. While Zayne went to go find the slaves, Jarael went to find a shuttle to transport the slaves out. Budan on the however discovered that the two of them were not sent and ordered them held and survey shuttles deactivated. With their escape ruined, Jarael and Zayne were forced into environmental suits and onto the surface of a comet, pursued by security forces while enduring the comet's violent storms.<ref name=\"k43\" />\n[[File:Zayne_Jarael_Crucible_Agents.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jarael and Zayne disguised themselves as Crucible operatives.]]\n\nFinally hailing the ''Hot Prospect'', Zayne ordered all the airlocks on the vessel opened while he used the Force to transport the eighty slaves on the comet inside&mdash;much to the displeasure of Gryph, who was unaware of Jarael's past involvement in the Crucible and believed it was a simple con to rip off the Sungrazer Cooperative. During the rescue however, the Crucible vessel called the [[Gladiator (Crucible)|''Gladiator'']] arrived under the command of [[Fleet Captain/Legends|Fleet Captain]] [[Dace Golliard]] who had dispatched [[Skyreaper drone]]s.<ref name=\"k43\" /> Distracted by the unexpected reunion with the man who had kidnapped her as a child, Jarael was taken by a drone but quickly rescued by Zayne and subsequently, Rohlan who hauled them back into the ''Hot Prospect''. The Gladiator pounded the Prospect with its superior firepower, preventing it from turning its thrusters and allowing Jarael to blast it with it's cannons that were fixed in one direction. However, the ''Hot Prospect'' used its array of drills and hooks and cables to create considerable damage to the ''Gladiator'' and then eventually, by jamming one of the ships main components, allowed the ''Prospect'' to spin wildly and Jarael to fire upon the ''Gladiator'' and escape into hyperspace.<ref name=\"k44\" />\n\nAt a transit hub near the Koornacht Cluster, the released slaves were unloaded and taken to a refugee center. Jarael finally came clean with Rohlan and Gryph regarding her past as a slaver and made a resolution to stop the Crucible. While Demagol did not hesitate in agreeing to assist her in anyway, Gryph proved reluctant in crossing a slaving organization though agreed when Zayne informed him he was going to work his next con alone.<ref name=\"k44\" /> Disguised as a Republic navy officer, by the name of \"Carth Kamlin\" in a salvaged [[Aurek-class tactical strikefighter|Aurek fighter]], Zayne infiltrated the Crucible on [[Volgax]]. However, Chantique discovered his true identity as Zayne Carrick and as a Jedi just prior to revealing Jarael's birth name and the meaning of \"Jarael\" as \"destroyer\".<ref name=\"k45\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 45|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 45]]</ref>\n\nWith Zayne's tracker discovered, the crew of the ''Hot Prospect'' had no means of locating Zayne. Jarael became desperate for help in finding Zayne even going as far as to ask the rejected Malak for assistance, much to Rohlan's discomfort. Knowing Elbee was aware of Zayne's new contacts, Jarael pleaded with the bulk-loader droid in help finding him. Elbee established a connection to his contacts who turned out to be Shel Jelavan on Coruscant, working for [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Haydel Goravvus]] of Taris. With Shel's help and records of travelers gone missing, Jarael and the crew were able to locate Zayne on Volgax, stranded in the pouring rain. However, Jarael found Zayne disgusted with her and miserable from his experience with the Crucible where Chantique made him become witness to the thousands of years of torture by melding minds with a [[Caamasi]] slave known as [[Ralthar Sitan]] and then informing him of Jarael's actions in the organization when she was a teenager. Jarael attempted to defend herself by explaining that she was merely trying to help the slaves but Zayne rejected the idea in favor that she could have done more for them instead of simply running away from the Crucible and then keeping her name which he still believed to mean \"destroyer.\" Jarael, now dejected herself over Zayne's anger, declared that if he really didn't know her after all they had been through together, then it was time for the two to part ways for he had standards that no one could possibly meet. While she went to tell the crew of the separation, she informed Zayne of the true meaning of her name.<ref name=\"k46\" />\n\n===Homecoming===\n{{Quote|I guess I won't be bringing the Crucible down, after all.

I have already rented the ship ...|Jarael and Wyrick|Knights of the Old Republic 47}}\nJarael was accompanied by Demagol to [[Wor Tandell/Legends|Wor Tandell]], where she lamented that there appeared to be no way that they could bring down the Crucible. However, Demagol told Jarael that he had learned the Crucible had a power base on the planet Osadia. He also believed that Jarael's kidnapped schoolmates were being held captive on Osadia. Demagol plotted a course for the planet, then revealed his true identity as Antos Wyrick. Wyrick promised Jarael that he would help her find her fellow students.<ref name=\"k47\" /> Throwing her arms around her lost teacher, Jarael was ecstatic to find her old master alive and well. Wyrick informed Jarael of how he became a Mandalorian after the school fell. However, Wyrick kept the Rohlan Dyre persona&mdash;claiming to have taken the name Rohlan Dyre when joining the Mandalorian Wars and constantly running away to find her. Wyrick did not inform Jarael of his other identity, Demagol, and of drugging the real Rohlan Dyre on Flashpoint station&mdash;a fact which Zayne and Gryph were discovering on Coruscant during \"Demagol\"'s trial.<ref name=\"k48\" />\n\n[[File:Jarael_on_Osadia.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jarael cutting down Chantique's security team on Osadia]]\nArriving at Osadia, Wyrick readied Jarael's supplies, expressing his wish to be the students' salvation and for Jarael to be his redemption. The pair found the school heavily guarded by security forces led by [[Bar'injar]]. Wyrick gave Jarael a lightweight armor he had crafted over the past several weeks, as well as a weapon stolen from the cache of weapons brought from the Jedi Covenant's artifact storehouse on Odryn&mdash;[[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun's]] [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"k48\" /> Jarael used the weapon to wound the guards while Wyrick killed Bar'injar. Wyrick then told Jarael to search the training hall, stating that she could not hold back against the people who had ruined their lives. As Jarael investigated, she heard a familiar voice taunting her, that of Chantique, whom Jarael had presumed dead. The Zeltron used the Force to send spears flying toward Jarael, who easily cut through them with her lightsaber. Chantique gloated on her successful attempt to turn Zayne against Jarael, implying that she would attempt to get him back to the dueling pits. This provoked Jarael into attacking. After a brief struggle, Jarael overcame Chantique and stood above her rival, ready to strike the killing blow.<ref name=\"k49\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 49|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 49]]</ref> As fate or even luck would have it, Zayne Carrick fell through the ceiling and crash landed on top of Jarael. The distraction gave Chantique an opportunity to seize the double-bladed saber and engage Zayne in a duel, demanding to know why he came back for Jarael. With her own Force powers being amplified by the dark power of the saber itself, Chantique saw into Zayne's thoughts and discovered her father, Wyrick, was also at the academy. Chantique fled from the battle to search for her father, allowing Zayne and Jarael to escape. During their escape, Zayne informed Jarael of Wyrick's identity of Demagol and the switch that took place at Flashpoint station while Jarael confessed to not feeling anything odd or cold regarding Exar Kun's lightsaber. Chantique returned, unable to find Wyrick, stronger than ever with the saber amplifying her powers. As she used the Force to throw Jarael and Zayne around the room, she seized Zayne's lightsaber and declared that she no longer needed the Crucible. However, her father found her and sunk a dagger into her shoulder. Wounded, Chantique told him where the other children&mdash;the other genetically modified children he created&mdash;were. However, he soon realized that she'd buried them alive.<ref name=\"k50\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 50|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 50]]</ref>\n\nDespite the loss, Demagol still believed he still had hope for his Mandalorian Knights with Jarael. Zayne however revealed that, due to Jarael's inability to feel the dark side emanating off Kun's saber, that she was only minimally Force sensitive. In other words, his project many years ago was a failure and his daughter, whom he believed was no use to him, was the one immensely strong in the Force due to his own Force sensitivity though he didn't even realize it. Suddenly, Chantique lashed out at Demagol with the dagger he put into her back. Attempting to use the Force to grab one of the two lightsabers&mdash;Kun's double-bladed saber or Zayne's single-bladed hilt&mdash; he accidentally grabbed Kun's saber and activated both ends at the blade went through both him and his daughter, killing them both.<ref name=\"k50\" />\n\nReturning to Coruscant and with the help of the real Rohlan Dyre, Zayne managed to track down former researchers who were on Demagol's project years prior. He discovered two researchers and after meeting with them, concluded that these were Jarael's parents and arranged a meeting between the three as a anniversary gift for their meeting one year prior. With tears in her eyes as well as in her parents for the return of their Edessa, Jarael thanked Zayne for the reunion though he confessed it was Rohlan who found them, though Rohlan had disappeared by this time. Finally reunited with her parents, Jarael decided she would stay on Coruscant to get to know them. The following evening at Marn Hierogryph's restaurant, ''[[Goodvalor's Little Bivoli]]'', Jarael dressed in a lavish evening gown, staged a romantic meeting with Zayne with the help of Gryph. Believing to be helping a customer, Zayne approached Jarael's table. She suggested that Zayne wasn't like the other Jedi&mdash;to be free of emotional connections and physical contact to which Zayne agreed he wasn't. He and Jarael shared a kiss and began a more intimate relationship.<ref name=\"k50\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You're good.

As a slave herself and wishing to improve the lives of the others, she challenged the Zeltron, Chantique, and defeated her resulting in Jarael becoming a slave minder and doing her best to improve the lives of the slaves she tended to. However, she could not bear it any longer and fled, hoping to hide away from the Crucible forever. Years after her time with the Crucible, she would still carry an immense amount of guilt of working with the Crucible despite her best efforts in helping the slaves.<ref name=\"k46\" /> Jarael was a fierce and hot-tempered Arkanian Offshoot, passionately devoted to the older man she only knew as Camper. While living in the lower cities of Taris, Jarael was emotionally defensive, not allowing anyone to see her true self. Despite Jarael's fierce temper, a softer side of her emerged upon traveling with Zayne Carrick after he had sacrificed himself to the [[Jedi Covenant]] in order to spare her, Camper and Gryph.<ref name=\"k6\" /> When captured by Mandalorians, she felt more concern towards others, notably the Jedi Alek when she witnessed the wounds dealt to him by the sadistic scientist Demagol.<ref name=\"k8\" /> When she was led to believe Zayne was killed by Demagol, she lunged at the scientist, enraged by the death of her friend, although, she soon discovered that it was Zayne in Demagol's armor.<ref name=\"k10\" /> When Zayne and Gryph parted from her and Camper's company, despite her distaste for Gryph and initial feelings of Zayne, she felt saddened by the loss of their presence.<ref name=\"k13\" />\n\nJarael's letting her guard down around others proved to be an undoing when Camper fell ill and she was forced to travel to Arkania to get him aid.<ref name=\"k16\" /> She unexpectedly found help in the very company Camper was running from. Lord Adasca charmed Jarael by granting her a suite to stay in and a vast wardrobe, though she was unknowingly being used to further Adasca's agenda,<ref name=\"k17\" /> until he revealed his plans of making her children purebloods.<ref name=\"k18\" /> Learning from this experience, Jarael became distant from others again, turning away from the romantic relationship sought by the Jedi Alek Squinquargesimus and later again when he came to recruit her for the Mandalorian Wars.<ref name=\"k23\" /><ref name=\"k42\" />\n\nEven with Camper gone, Jarael found herself now in the assistance of her friend Zayne in his quest to bring the Jedi Covenant to justice&mdash;despite Rohlan's attempts to stop his foolhardy quest, going as far as throwing herself in front of the Republic fleet to allow Zayne to make it to Coruscant.<ref name=\"k31\" /> After Zayne had cleared his name, Jarael became torn between her friends in Zayne, Rohlan and Alek. She could not abandon Rohlan, a Mandalorian stuck in Republic space, but did not wish to part from Zayne and Gryph's company.<ref name=\"k35\" /> During this time, she was exposed to the slavery and brawls of Jervo's World and disliked the usage of brawlers and slaves for entertainment value due to her own past as a slaver.<ref name=\"kotor40\" /><ref name=\"kotor41\" />\n\nAfter she was discovered to have the ability to use the Force, Rohlan constantly spoke to her to learn about how to use it from Zayne. Though she did not appreciate what she defined as nagging, she did appreciate that Zayne did not concern himself with her previously benign ability and let her ask him for training herself, though he still opened himself to her if and when she ever needed help.<ref name=\"k39\" /><ref name=\"kotor40\" /> Still fierce and hot-tempered however, she snapped back at Zayne when he became angry with her for her past actions in the Crucible slave organization, finding that he had too high of standards, and ended their partnership in bringing down the Crucible.<ref name=\"k46\" />\n\n===Relationships===\n====Antos Wyrick====\n{{Quote|My Edessa. My triumph.|Antos Wyrick to Jarael|Knights of the Old Republic 47}}\n[[File:Demagol_unmasked.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Antos Wyrick, Jarael's former professor]]\nThe Zeltron Antos Wyrick, on the surface, was the beloved teacher of Jarael during her early childhood at the Osadia School. Beneath the surface however and unknown to Jarael, Wyrick bore a sadistic personality, developed by the [[Iskalloni]]&mdash;using live and sentient test subjects for his experiments as his Mandalorian persona as Demagol during the early stages of the Mandalorian Wars. Wyrick claimed Jarael as his greatest student and after her kidnapping by Crucible slavers, searched for her.<ref name=\"k48\" /> Though the first time seeing Jarael after her kidnapping, he did not recognize her, he immediately realized his mistake upon witnessing her ears though the timely arrival of Zayne Carrick prevented him from looking further into the matter.<ref name=\"k8\" /> Jarael would later regret never having the chance to say goodbye to Wyrick before her kidnapping.<ref name=\"k47\" />\n\nThough Jarael regarded Wyrick as an honored elder,<ref name=\"k47\" /> \"perero\" in the old Arkanian language,<ref name=\"k5\" /> Wyrick used trickery and frequently lied to Jarael,<ref name=\"k48\" /> For one, he stole the identity of Rohlan Dyre after the Mandalorians had fled the station in an effort to become closer to Jarael. In addition, he never revealed his identity to Jarael until her return to Osadia,<ref name=\"k47\" /> supposedly out of fear of her rejecting him for his failure to protect her. Finally, he continued to use the Rohlan Dyre persona and did not inform her that he was Demagol&mdash;the butcher who had tortured and tried to torture and experiment on two of her friends at Flashpoint.<ref name=\"k48\" /> Despite these faults of Wyrick, while disguised as Rohlan, he swore to protect her soon after Camper went into Wild Space after the Battle of Omonoth.<ref name=\"k21\" /> He frequently expressed his desire to make Jarael better by developing her combat skills<ref name=\"k23\" /> and exploring her Force Sensitivity.<ref name=\"k37\" /> He also valiantly protected her against others such as the two Jedi, Lucien Draay when he suggested killing her,<ref name=\"k21\" /> and then again when the Jedi Malak attempted to persuade her to join the Revanchists&mdash;resulting in a violent brawl.<ref name=\"k42\" />\n\n====Gorman Vandrayk====\n{{Quote|You're very close to him.''\"<br />\"''He rescued me when I was in trouble, years ago.

Jarael became torn between helping the man she now considered \"perero\" and keeping \"The Company\", better known as The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania, from him. Despite Jarael's best efforts of obtaining a cure for Camper during her time on Arkania, it inevitably led Adascorp straight to Camper and both their capture.<ref name=\"k16\" /> Jarael assisted in bringing in medics to bring Camper into the ''Arkanian Legacy'',<ref name=\"k17\" /> though it would be the final time Jarael would see Camper in person.<ref name=\"k21\" /> During this time, Jarael learned of Camper's past as scientist Gorman Vandrayk, working on the Exorgorth project for [[Argaloh Adasca]] and then escaping upon learning of his intention to use the creatures for galactic dominance. Argaloh's grandson, Arkoh, kept Jarael content by attempting to be a sympathetic friend to her as he constantly fed misinformation to her regarding Camper's condition&mdash;information which involved him remaining in a coma which deeply upset Jarael.<ref name=\"k17\" /> Arkoh soon revealed his desire to continue his grandfather's scheme of galactic dominance using the exogorths and Camper's knowledge of them and with it, the truth that Camper was had in fact gotten well and was being held against his will by Adasca.<ref name=\"k18\" /> Though Jarael was knowingly a prisoner herself, during Adasca's selling of the exogorths to Admiral Saul Karath and Mandalore the Ultimate, she managed to sneak away and communicate with Camper with the bracelet he had made during which she expressed her sincerest apologies for leading Adascorp and telling him to stop helping Adasca though he refused due to his own desire to protect Jarael. Their conversation was cut short by Adasca who seized her communicator and threatened to use Jarael as a test subject.<ref name=\"k20\" />\n\nFortunately, a battle had sprung out between Republic forces and Mandalorians on the Arkanian Legacy, allowing Camper to drive the exorgorths into Arkoh Adasca's command bridge. Camper took the exogorths into wild space but not before opening up a holographic communications with Jarael. Jarael begged Camper to wait for her but Camper confessed that she deserved better then hiding like they were for years. Camper bound Rohlan Dyre to protect her before saying his final goodbye and cutting communications. Jarael attempted to embrace the faded holographic image in her sorrow.<ref name=\"k21\" /> Due to Camper leaving her, Jarael became distant from Zayne Carrick and Rohlan Dyre, unsure of what to do for herself.<ref name=\"k23\" /> She found purpose in fully pledging herself to Zayne's quest to clear his name of the Padawan Massacre of Taris<ref name=\"k29\" /> and then becoming part of Cargryph Capital as a con artist<ref name=\"k36\" /> which led her back into the Crucible slaving organization.<ref name=\"kotor41\" /> After having a falling out with Zayne, Jarael confessed that her goodbyes were rarely pleasant due to Camper's farewell being a hologram.<ref name=\"k47\" />\n\n====Zayne Carrick====\n{{Quote|Umm...when you say ''physical contact''&mdash;you're not going to ''beat me up'' again, are you?''\"<br />\"''Oh, shut up.|Zayne Carrick and Jarael|Knights of the Old Republic 50}}\nUpon the first encounter of Zayne and Jarael, the tensions between the two were extremely hostile&mdash;with Jarael attacking him and numbing his arm with her shock staff in the Undercity of Taris. The pair couldn't barely be in the same room without one insulting the other with Zayne addressing Jarael as \"Darth Sunshine.\" Zayne found Jarael to be difficult to be around with her short temper, and she blamed him for Lhosan Industries moving off Taris resulting in hundreds of jobs lost in response to the Padawan Massacre of Taris on top of her already bitter attitude.<ref name=\"k3\" /> Despite Zayne's discomfort around Jarael, he showed concern for her safety to which Jarael angrily brushed off and would again strike Zayne again during his holographic transmission to Dantooine.<ref name=\"k4\" />\n\n[[File:Jarael.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jarael confronts Zayne Carrick.]]\nThe pair, as they spent more time together hiding out in the asteroid field near Taris, found it vital to work together as they ventured on the Rogue Moon's surface on a search for the bulker-lifter droid, Elbee. However, the two would find more matters to fight about soon after retrieving the droid and evading the Taris Civil Authorities once more.<ref name=\"k4\" /> Marn Hierogryph became prepared to strike a deal with the bounty hunter Valius Ying when they were discovered in order for him, Jarael and Camper to escape but meant Zayne would be turned over. Zayne attempted to steal ''The Last Resort'' away to escape but was stopped by Jarael. Jarael passionately reprimanded Zayne for his selfishness to which Zayne took to heart and willingly sacrificed himself to save her and the others, throwing his lightsaber at Jarael's feet.<ref name=\"k5\" /> The sacrifice would move Jarael and her, along with Gryph, Camper and Elbee, to stage a daring rescue and assault on the Jedi Tower. Jarael herself plunged through the Jedi Tower's glass ceiling, wielding Zayne's lightsaber and wearing a red environmental suit, the same seen in Zayne's captors Force vision. Zayne and Jarael rocketed out of the Tower and escaped on board ''The Last Resort'', commenting how they couldn't allow Zayne to go around sensibly sacrificing himself for others, ending Jarael's life on Taris and moving her out of the Lower City to begin a new life of conning targets for credits.<ref name=\"k6\" />\n\nZayne and Jarael's friendship began to take form quickly after escaping Taris. The two constantly protected the other, with Zayne rescuing her from Flashpoint station and just prior to her lashing out at the mad scientist Demagol (in reality, a disguised Zayne) for Zayne's supposed death.<ref name=\"k10\" /> When the two parted ways, to each others regret, Jarael covered her sadness over the departure with a crack at Marn Hierogryph. Due to Camper's declining health Jarael admitted she was happy that she hadn't killed him. As Jarael and Camper sped away on ''The Last Resort'' from Ralltiir, Zayne only wished he had company, apart from the con-artist Gryph.<ref name=\"k13\" />\n\nThough separated from each other for a certain length of time, the friendship Jarael and Zayne possessed would not wither during that time. In fact, when the two met up again on the ''Arkanian Legacy'', Jarael kissed Zayne&mdash;if only to get close enough to provide Zayne with information on her and Camper's situation as Arkoh Adasca's prisoners. When Camper departed for Wild space with the exorgorths, leaving Jarael with no obvious purpose, Zayne would ask her for her help in bringing down the Jedi Covenant&mdash;believing himself to die without her.<ref name=\"k21\" /> Though the two were not yet romantically linked, their relationship was growing to be more then mere friendship though Jarael often forgot about Zayne being five years her junior due to his experiences on the run.<ref name=\"k39\" /> Returning to Taris to help Gryph and the Taris Resistance, the Jedi Alek remarked soon afterwords, after Jarael had rejected his own pursuits for a romantic relationship, that she should ask herself if it was just \"not now\" or if it was just not him.<ref name=\"k23\" /> The Taris Resistance was soon attacked by Cassus Fett and forced to flee further underground. Jarael became tasked with Zayne's childhood crush, Shel Jelavan, to bring Constable Sowrs' children to Alderaan. During the trip, the pair at the very least became acquainted with one another without any signs of tension between the two&mdash;with Jarael finding Shel to be \"nice,\"<ref name=\"k29\" /> though Shel would later wonder, and comment to Alek, if there was anything more to Jarael and Zayne's relationship. Jarael helped Zayne run and then gave him time to confront the Covenant and finally \"face the music\" when he was ready.<ref name=\"k42\" />\n\nIt wouldn't be long before the Jedi Covenant was brought down and Zayne and Gryph were exonerated for their crimes.<ref name=\"k35\" /> Jarael and as a result, Rohaln Dyre, continued to help Zayne and Gryph with their criminal activities (though the targets were those who Zayne believed deserved it)<ref name=\"k36\" /> and after almost being killed by the Raff Syndicate, Jarael discovered her dormant Force sensitivity<ref name=\"k37\" /> but with it, her guilt regarding her past as a Crucible slaver began to increase and the guilt steamed into her feelings for Zayne. She had at least one Force vision that mirrored her rescue of Zayne from the Jedi Covenant on Taris though the masters were replaced by Demagol, Arkoh Adasca, Malak (formerly Alek) and Rohaln Dyre. Zayne would also be involved in the vision as Jarael saw him beaten and in chains being pulled in by Chantique, asking Jarael how she could have done it.<ref name=\"kotor40\" /> On Jervo's World, the dueling champion Goethar Kleej recognized her as a Crucible slaver and told Zayne to stay away from her. Despite Goethar's advice, Zayne pursued Jarael, who fled into her private quarters. Jarael informed Zayne that she was in fact a slaver and slammed the door.<ref name=\"kotor41\" /> The revelation put a strain on their relationship. Whenever Zayne tried to talk to Jarael, she ran from it, avoiding talking to him at all believing that due to his wish to be a Jedi Knight, it would place the two at odds. Jarael simply wanted Zayne to drop the subject and help her run from the Crucible.<ref name=\"k42\" />\n\nTo Jarael's surprise, Zayne refused to reject Jarael and desperately wanted to help her and stop the Crucible's slaving organization. Zayne evidently sympathized with Jarael for who she was and believed her story regarding the fact that she was only a slaver to ''help'' the other slaves. When Malak approached Jarael and asked him to join him against the Mandalorians, Jarael evidently was uncomfortable with the still-smitten Jedi and his request. Discouraged, Malak ceased pursuing Jarael any further and left while Jarael and Zayne prepared to bring down the Crucible. Though Zayne did not know if Jarael wanted to be with Malak, he preferred that she would make that choice herself.<ref name=\"k42\" /> Zayne's trust in Jarael would not last long however. Zayne was soon captured by the Crucible and brought before Chantique&mdash;the minder Jarael had known and beaten in the past. Chantique informed Zayne that Jarael was in fact a liar and the marks on her face meant destroyer.<ref name=\"k45\" /> She also delved into his mind that \"his Jarael\" was not worthy of his trust and in his heart, he knew it. Chantique played on the fact that Zayne was unsure of Jarael's age of twenty-five&mdash;a fact that would relevant to the nineteen year old Jedi who may or may not have romantic feelings towards the woman. Though Zayne sensed that Chantique was in fact influencing his thoughts with the Force, Zayne still believed Chantique. The Crucible dumped Zayne and Jarael and the crew of the ''Hot Prospect'' found him. Ecstatic to see him again, Jarael rushed out to him thought Zayne was less than pleased and rejected Jarael, forcing Jarael to admit that Zayne had standards that nobody could live up to despite his own failures.<ref name=\"k46\" /> The two parted ways again on far less than good terms. Jarael was once again lost and unsure what to do, deeply upset over her fight with Zayne, while in tow with Rohlan Dyre who wanted to continue her fight against the Crucible and returned her to Osadia.<ref name=\"k47\" />\n\n[[File:ZayneJaraelOneYearLater.jpg|thumb|right|Jarael and Zayne one year later]]\nDespite their argument, Zayne felt an immense amount of guilt when discovering that Rohlan was in actuality Demagol, or Antos Wyrick, in disguise and used all the [[Rogue Moon Project|resources]] he had at his disposal, including the debt owed to him by Cassus Fett for the events that occurred at Jebble.<ref name=\"k48\" />Zayne discovered where Wyrick had taken Jarael after Cassus Fett lured Dace Golliard and the Gladiator into a conflict with Saul Karath and the Republic fleet, resulting in his capture and confession of where Chantique had also gone.<ref name=\"k49\" /> Zayne and Rohlan rushed to Osadia where Zayne stopped Jarael from killing Chantique and dueled with the Zeltron himself. Zayne professed he finally figured out that Chantique manipulated him and that he was wrong for not trusting Jarael. Zayne assisted Jarael, though still believing that Jarael thought less of him, in escaping but not before Wyrick killed himself and Chantique with Exar Kun's lightsaber accidentally. Jarael and Zayne returned to Coruscant and with Rohlan's help, Zayne reunited Jarael's parents with her as a one year anniversary of their meeting gift.<ref name=\"k50\" />\n\nThe evening following Jarael's family reunion, exactly one year from the day Zayne encountered Jarael in Junk Junction, Jarael and Marn Hierogyrph set Zayne up to meet up with her at Goodvalor's Little Bivoli. Dressed in an elegant evening gown, Jarael asked Zayne if he was a Jedi who avoided physical and emotional connections to which he replied that he wasn't a Jedi at all. To that, the two shared an intimate kiss&mdash;one that was not a ruse though Zayne asked if Jarael was going to attack him as she did one year prior.<ref name=\"k50\" />\n\n====Malak====\n{{Quote|You&mdash;using the Force?

The Mandalorians who had captured Jarael, falsely believing her to be a Jedi, had taken her there for the experiments of the notorious Mandalorian scientist Demagol, the sadistic scientist who had been studying Jedi in an attempt to discover just what it was that gave them their considerable powers and abilities. Squint met Jarael immediately after one of Demagol's \"studies,\" recognizing her as a new prisoner and, not detecting her latent Force-sensitivity, realizing she herself wasn't a Jedi. Knowing that Demagol's experiments would likely kill anyone who didn't have a Jedi's resilience, Squint volunteered to continue to be Demagol's subject in Jarael's place, in spite of the fact that he himself could hardly stand.<ref name=\"k8\" /> Jarael recognized the sacrifice Squint was making and following the arrival of Zayne Carrick and Rohlan Dyre and the liberation of the prisoners, Squint and Jarael departed on good terms, in which he revealed to her his real name, Alek.<ref name=\"k10\" />\n\n[[File:MalakAndJarael-KOTOR42.jpg|thumb|left|Malak and Jarael]]\nJarael and Alek would later be reunited at Omonoth aboard Arkoh Adasca's ''Arkanian Legacy'', where Adasca had invited several parties, including the [[Revan/Legends|Revanchist's]] group of Jedi whom Alek represented, to negotiate a price for rights to the exogorth swarm Adascorp had discovered. Jarael was delighted to see Alek again; to her he was a friendly and familiar face in an increasingly dangerous situation as Adasca held her hostage for Gorman Vandrayk's hidden knowledge of the giants slugs. The pleased feelings appeared to be mutual on Alek's part of this unexpected reunion.<ref name=\"k19\" /> When Adasca later struck Jarael, claiming he thought her to be special compared to her fellow Arkanian Offshoots, Alek came to Jarael's defense, holding his lightsaber to Adasca's throat and noting that she was ''indeed'' special and promising to end Adasca's life if he hurt her again.<ref name=\"k20\" />\n\nAfter the situation on Omonoth deteriorated and the ''Arkanian Legacy'' destroyed,<ref name=\"k21\" /> Alek accompanied Zayne, Jarael, and their companions back to Taris, where Alek remained with Jarael, Rohlan, and Dob Moomo aboard the ''Moomo Williwaw'' in orbit. Hoping to take her mind off of losing her longtime friend Vandrayk, Rohlan suggested she spar with Alek. In spite of the Jedi's considerable skill, Jarael was able to knock him down during their match, to Alek's surprise. After finishing sparring, Jarael to Alek expressed her regret and sorrow that Camper was gone. Alek, with his own fondness and attraction for Jarael growing and seeing her distress tried to comfort her, both emotionally and physically. Jarael rebuffed him, however, stating that it was too soon after being taken advantage of by Adasca as well as losing her longtime friend and father figure to consider any kind of physical companionship. Alek claimed to understand, but questioned if it was necessarily a bad time for her or if he simply wasn't the person she wanted.<ref name=\"k23\" />\n\nAlek soon parted ways with Jarael again when he went ahead to Coruscant with Shel Jelavan to make contact with members of the Jedi Council in an effort to help Zayne clear his name.<ref name=\"k31\" /> He would return to the Revanchist's Jedi Crusaders shortly after the Vindication incident, though not before he offered to take Jarael with him. Jarael was tempted to go with Alek, now going under the alias Malak, but chose to stay with Zayne and the others, noting that her companions, particularly Rohlan, still needed her help.<ref name=\"k35\" />\n\nShortly after this, the Jedi Crusaders encountered a vision of Mandalorian barbarism on Cathar, strengthening their resolve to stop the Mandalorians and making the Revanchist Jedi and the Republic military official allies. With this sanction and the fact that Rohlan was now a sports hero thanks to swoop dueling, Malak felt that there was nothing stopping Jarael joining him and the Revanchist movement. He tracked Jarael to Wor Tandell, where he made the offer to join him once again, claiming that they needed her and her natural combat abilities, which he had witnessed firsthand at Omonoth as well as in their sparring. Though Jarael was reluctant to accept, she also couldn't reject him outright and Malak was insistent, especially when he learned of her Force-sensitivity. It was only when Zayne kissed Jarael, claiming to be with her, that Malak gave in. Malak was unhappy to have seemingly lost Jarael for good, for both his movement and especially himself, but he departed without incident to continue fighting the war.<ref name=\"k42\" />\n\n====Arkoh Adasca====\n{{Quote|Once we understand your genome, we may be able to see that your children will be ''true'' Arkanians.''\" <br />\"''My&mdash;? Hey, it's just ''dinner''! You're getting ahead of yourself here!|Arkoh Adasca and Jarael|Knights of the Old Republic 18}}\nJarael first encountered Arkoh when her plan to get medical attention to Camper failed and she was immediately brought before the Arkanian businessman aboard the massive vessel, the ''Arkanian Legacy''. Distrustful of Arkoh and his intentions but faced with no other option but to turn Camper over to Adascorp to save his life, she allowed the ''Arkanian Legacy'' to capture ''The Last Resort''. While Camper was taken into the quarantine centers on the Legacy, Arkoh began to charm Jarael with his seemingly good-intentioned kindness despite her own reluctance to trust the young pure-Arkanian. Despite that, she bought into his false-story of Camper's illness with the Balinquar's virus. Arkoh presented Jarael with a luxurious suite on the Arkanian Legacy with holographic recordings of Camper's condition&mdash;though these were also false as it was one constant image of Camper laying still. Seeing the man she swore to protect in this condition deeply upset Jarael and Arkoh preyed upon her showing vulnerability and manipulated her into trusting him and accepting Adascorp's \"help.\" He provided expensive clothing and droid wait-service while she believed Camper was being cared for; all the while Camper was being manipulated himself into finishing [[Project Black Harvest]], a secret project involving exorgorths else Jarael would be harmed.<ref name=\"k17\" />\n\n[[File:Jarael_and_Adasca.jpg|thumb|200px|Arkoh Adasca charms Jarael on board the ''Arkanian Legacy''.]]\nEven though Arkoh had lied and manipulated Jarael, he was truly fascinated by the Arkanian off-shoot despite the fact that he and his family had a belief that off-shoots were a taint on the Arkanian race. He managed to obtain a blood sample from Jarael to determine what exactly she was&mdash;due to him finding her so pureblooded. Upon arrival on Oomonoth, Arkoh had invited Jarael for dinner on the observation deck. By now, Jarael had been swayed by the charming Arkoh and found his company pleasant. However, the dinner quickly turned sour when their discussion turned to the Arkanian offshoots and Arkoh revealed his own prejudice against them. Arkoh also revealed his intentions to restore the true Arkanian race starting with Jarael's children&mdash;a proposition Jarael found discomforting. Finally, he told her about the exogorths and how he wanted to use the space slugs to place Arkania at the center of the galaxy with him brokering deals with the major forces such as the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorians with Camper being forced to make the exogorths be controlled by Adasca.<ref name=\"k18\" />\n\nAs a small team of Republic operatives, led by Saul Karath, arrived at Oomonoth, Jarael attempted to flee. Destroying several HK-24 units and pointing one of their rifles directly at Adasca, Arkoh threatened to remove Camper's hands. Jarael. Jarael was forced to go along with Arkoh to greet his guests. Zayne Carrick happened to be captured by Saul Karath and brought along. After Jarael kissed Zayne to feed him information regarding the situation, Arkoh struck Zayne and seized Jarael away, finding her display of affection to be \"charming\".<ref name=\"k19\" /> While Arkoh attempted to broker his deals with Mandalore the Ultimate, Saul Karath and Alek (representing the Revanchist leader), Jarael managed to walk away to communicate with Camper through her bracelet. Arkoh witnessed this and after a brief struggle with Jarael, he struck her declaring that he thought she might had been special.<ref name=\"k20\" /> Jarael's blood had been finished being analyzed by now and Eejee Vamm determined the reasoning for Arkoh's fascination of Jarael: she had the blood of the Arkanian hero, Arca Jeth, though Eejee would take this fact to the grave when he was shot by Antos Wyrick, disguised as Rohlan Dyre.<ref name=\"k48\" /> Soon afterwards, Zayne Carrick managed to escape with the help of Lucien Draay and began a fight in the observation deck allowing Jarael to escape and Camper to turn the exorgorths on Arkoh&mdash;killing the Arkanian businessman.<ref name=\"k21\" />\n\nArkoh's abuse of Jarael and Camper fleeing into deep space with the exogorths hurt her&mdash;making her reclusive.<ref name=\"k23\" /> Eventually, she moved on and officially pledged herself to Zayne Carrick's goal of clearing his name.<ref name=\"k28\" /> Even after he had cleared his name, Jarael was haunted by Arkoh Adasca. On at least one occasion, she had a dream of him, Malak, Demagol and Rohlan Dyre taking her away while Zayne was chained by the Zeltron Chantique.<ref name=\"kotor40\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Living things are capable of many wonders, ''Jarael''.

Using her skills, she challenged and managed to defeat her own minder, Chantique, who was sold off due to the injuries she had sustained. Jarael's skills in fighting would later enable her to fend off bounty hunters, multiple law enforcement agents,<ref name=\"k16\" /> and extremely dangerous assassin droids.<ref name=\"k18\" /> Even when fighting proved useless, such as when she was surrounded by many Mandalorians, Jarael fought viciously and tenaciously.<ref name=\"k7\" /> She was also adept in riding beasts through rough terrain though it was not her strongest ability: she was flung from a tandreed on Wor Tandell.<ref name=\"k42\" />\n\nJarael demonstrated an advanced mastery of disguises. In the course of her travels with Zayne Carrick, Jarael disguised herself as a Sith Lord,<ref name=\"k6\" /> twice as a Jedi,<ref name=\"k7\" /><ref name=\"k29\" /> as a wealthy official and as a pureblood Arkanian, only blowing her cover when she desired or when her actions caused suspicion.<ref name=\"k16\" /> Her most successful disguise was during her infiltration mission on Odryn when she disguised herself as Celeste Morne, using face paint and black hair-dye. Thus disguised, Jarael managed to slip in and out of the Sanctum of the Exalted without arousing the suspicions of any of the Sanctum's Feeorin guards.<ref name=\"k29\" /> Even after clearing Zayne's name, Jarael would disguise herself twice: as Captain Brackel, a space pirate, in order to rip off the Raff Syndicate on Metellos 3;<ref name=\"k36\" /> and as a Crucible slaver, so as to release the slaves found on a mining facility in the Koornact Cluster.<ref name=\"k43\" />\n\nDespite carrying the DNA of the Arkanian Jedi Master, Arca Jeth, Jarael herself possessed only a minimal affinity for the Force.<ref name=\"k48\" /> At the urging of Demagol, she believed she had used her natural affinity with the Force to break her chains on Metellos 3, without Jedi training.<ref name=\"k37\" /> It was later revealed that it was in fact Demagol himself who had broken the chain.<ref name=\"k50\" /> Jarael had what was either a Force vision or a simple dream when her fears concerning her mysterious past manifested themselves. In this vision, she saw Malak, Rohlan, Demagol and Arkoh Adasca&mdash;all of whom wished to reveal her past&mdash;and finally Zayne, beaten and chained, being pulled into the shadows by her old foe, Chantique.<ref name=\"kotor40\" />\n\nAfter separating from Zayne's team, Jarael and Demagol left for Osadia to release the former students of the New Generation Academy of Crucible's slavery. On the planet, the sadistic scientist gave her the double-bladed lightsaber of the Sith Lord Exar Kun,<ref name=\"k48\" /> a deadly weapon that she had no trouble mastering. Jarael used the saberstaff against Chantique to great effect, slicing the dozens of sharp objects that the Zeltron sent flying at her before they could make contact.<ref name=\"k49\" /> Following the revelation that her connection to the Force was only minimal, and that all of her abilities were in fact the result of years of training her body, it would seem as though any prospect of training Jarael as a Force-user seems to have ended.<ref name=\"k50\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Jaraelsears.jpg|thumb|Jarael's pointed ears]]\nJarael was created by writer [[John Jackson Miller]] for the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (comic series)|''Knights of the Old Republic'']] comic series, first appearing in the first story arc, [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Commencement|''Commencement'']], drawn by [[Brian Ching]].<ref name=\"k4\" /> Initially, a supporting character to main protagonists Zayne Carrick and Marn Hierogryph, the [[2007]] story arcs of [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Days of Fear|''Days of Fear'']], [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Nights of Anger|''Nights of Anger'']], and [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Daze of Hate|''Daze of Hate'']] gave Jarael a central role of the story with the origins of Camper revealed to the reader.<ref name=\"k21\" /> Upon completion of the series first overall arc involving Zayne's quest in exposing the Jedi Covenant, the series shifted its arc towards Jarael's past and focusing on her and Zayne's efforts to bring down the slaving organization known as the Crucible<ref name=\"k42\" /> which concluded the series itself with [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Demon|''Demon'']] as the final story arc.<ref name=\"Endofseries\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.cbr.com/inside-diamonds-retailer-summit|title=Inside Diamond's Retailer Summit!|author=Phegley, Kiel|date=20210126211132|work=CBR.com|archivedate=20210126211132}}</ref>\n\nJarael, like Camper, is described as an Arkanian offshoot.
