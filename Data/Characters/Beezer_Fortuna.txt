A cousin of [[Bib Fortuna]], Fortuna was a member of the [[Partisans]] led by [[Saw Gerrera]], and was on [[Jedha]] at the [[time]] of the [[Destruction of Jedha City|Destruction of]] [[Jedha City]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender|male]] [[Twi'lek]] from the [[species]]' [[homeworld]] of [[Ryloth]], Beezer Fortuna was a member of the [[Fortuna family|Fortuna]] clan, a powerful Twi'lek family with close connections to the criminal underworld of [[the galaxy]]. He stood out from other Twi'leks by his dried-out, desiccated [[lekku]] and his comparatively small pupils. He was also the cousin of [[Bib Fortuna]], who worked on the remote [[desert]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]] as [[majordomo]] of the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. Fortuna despised his family's connection to the underworld, and was always considered to be the most [[Politics|politically]]-minded of his clan.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" />\n\n[[File:Beezer_Fortuna_R1_comic.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fortuna confronting Bodhi Rook.]]\nDuring the [[Clone Wars]], Fortuna witnessed the occupation of Ryloth by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], as well as its later [[Battle of Ryloth|liberation]] by the combined efforts of the [[Grand Army of the Republic|Grand Army of the]] [[Galactic Republic|Republic]], the [[Jedi Order]], and [[Twi'lek Resistance|Twi'lek freedom fighters]] under the leadership of [[Cham Syndulla]]. The efforts of the liberators inspired Fortuna, and he became a seditionist in the Twi'lek [[capital]] [[city]] of [[Lessu]]. After the war ended, the [[Galactic Empire]] came to Ryloth,<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" /> and Fortuna fought against the Imperial occupation.<ref name=\"Databank\">{{Databank|beezer-fortuna|Beezer Fortuna|archivedate=20170605063544}}</ref> He was rounded up by the Empire alongside other seditionists in Lessu. However, he and his fellows were freed in a raid led by [[Saw Gerrera]] and his [[Partisans]], and Fortuna became loyal to Saw,<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" /> choosing to fight the Empire rather than follow his clan's example of seeking profits in the underworld.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nAround six [[Standard month|months]] before the [[Destruction of Jedha City]],<ref name=\"SW.com interview\">{{SW|url=news/greg-rucka-interview-star-wars-guardians-of-the-whills|text=Greg Rucka Talks Chirrut, Baze, and the Cost of War in ''Star Wars: Guardians of the Whills''}}</ref> Fortuna helped recruit both [[Chirrut \u00cemwe]] and [[Baze Malbus]] into the partisans. This relationship did not last long, however. Just before Baze and Chirrut were to load up the orphans to help them escape [[Jedha]] on a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class ship]], Fortuna, along with two other partisans, attempted to take the [[Starship|ship]] for themselves, planning on driving it into the [[Star Destroyer]] that hovered above Jedha. They believed this would destroy the [[Star]] Destroyer and send a powerful message to the Empire. \u00cemwe and Malbus were able to take the ship back, convincing Fortuna and the other two partisans that it would look bad on Gerrera if word got out that the orphans who were attempting escape were denied because of the partisans' actions. This event ended any communications between \u00cemwe and Malbus and Gerrera's partisans.<ref name=\"Guardians of the Whills\">[[Guardians of the Whills (novel)|''Guardians of the Whills'']]</ref>\n\nAs of [[0 BBY]], Fortuna assisted Gerrera with operational planning,<ref name=\"Databank\" /> serving as one of Gerrera's chief strategists in the [[Catacombs of Cadera]] near [[Jedha City]] on Jedha.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" /> He was part of the group who intercepted the Imperial [[pilot]] [[Bodhi Rook]] after he defected from the Empire, carrying a message recorded by [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]] on [[Eadu]]. Fortuna and his compatriots leveled their weapons at the pilot, though Rook convinced Fortuna's group to take him to Gerrera.<ref name=\"Rogue One comic\">[[Rogue One Adaptation 1|''Rogue One Adaptation'' 1]]</ref> They led him to [[Benthic]], who in turn brought Rook to Gerrera. In the wake of a [[Battle on Jedha|skirmish]] between the Partisans and [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]] in Jedha City, [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]], an [[agent]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], and his allies [[Jyn Erso]], Malbus and \u00cemwe, were captured by Gerrera's cell after Andor [[Death|killed]] one of his Partisans. At the [[time]] of their arrival in the catacombs, Fortuna was in conversation with a fellow Partisan at a [[dejarik]] table at the base. Shortly after, the Empire conducted a test-firing of its [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]], and its [[superlaser]] destroyed Jedha City. The single-[[reactor]] ignition caused a shock wave of debris that engulfed the Partisan base.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA [[Color|pale]]-skinned Twi'lek male, Beezer Fortuna had a gaunt physique and thin, desiccated lekku. He had piercing blue [[eye]]s and sharp, angular features. As one of Saw Gerrera's Partisans, Fortuna wore dark [[robe]]s and carried an [[electro-prod staff]].<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBeezer Fortuna draws inspiration from early pre-production maquette sculpts for [[Bib Fortuna]].<ref name=\"Pablo tweet 1\">{{Twitter|pablohidalgo|status/807742423489052672|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=This pre-production Bib Fortuna maquette from Return of the Jedi is relevant to some of the latest Rogue One photos.|image=File:TwitterCap_pablohidalgo_RogueOneUVGdump.png}}</ref> The character's production nickname was \"Cousin Bib,\" so [[Pablo Hidalgo]] integrated that detail into his backstory when writing ''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''.<ref name=\"Pablo tweet 2\">{{Twitter|pablohidalgo|status/816059010990280704|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=p. 85.
