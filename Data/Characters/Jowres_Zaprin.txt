He was the son of [[Larence Zaprin]] and lived at the remote [[Zaprin Estate]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] with [[Zaprin family|his family]]. His sister [[Mia Zaprin|Mia]] called him '''Jowy'''.\n\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], a group of sick [[Narglatch/Legends|narglatches]] and [[Mott/Legends|motts]] surrounded the Zaprin's home. Jowres and his sister Mia went outside to check the situation but were attacked by the crazed animals. Both were wounded by the animals and developed a severe infection. His worried father sent an urgent call for help and soon a [[Medic/Legends|medic]] arrived at the Zaprin Estate. The medic first tried to help Mia, but the treatment didn't work. So the medic single-handedly killed several of the sick creatures that surrounded the house. From blood samples extracted from the creatures' bodies, the medic was able to create an anti-toxin. After an injection with the new medicine, Jowres and Mia recovered from the infection within a week.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Jowres_Zaprin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Two randomly-generated depictions of Jowres Zaprin.]]\nJowres Zaprin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:HC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Jowres Zaprin was added to the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\nJowres Zaprin could be found in a remote building in the Nabooian [[Gallo Mountains/Legends|Gallo Mountains]] south-east of the [[Varykino/Legends|Lake Retreat]].
