His disarming, self-deprecating sense of humor made it easy for him to connect with people, even those who might otherwise dismiss him based on his upper-crust status.\n\nAside from being a rich socialite with a million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] in his account, Brya was also a fit and skilled [[Shockball/Legends|shockball]] player, if not much of a fighter.
