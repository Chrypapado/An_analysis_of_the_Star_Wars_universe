Four [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] later,<ref name=\"TBSB:37\" /> Beruss signed the [[Declaration of a New Republic/Legends|Declaration of a New Republic]].<ref name=\"HESB:9\">''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]'', p. 9</ref> She subsequently served as a representative of the Corellian exiles on the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[New Republic Provisional Council|Provisional Council]].<ref name=\"WG:4\" />\n\nApproximately [[5 ABY/Legends|one year]] after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]],<ref name=\"OV3\">''[[Star Wars Omnibus: X-Wing Rogue Squadron Volume 3]]''</ref> [[General/Legends|General]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]] informed Beruss and the rest of the Council of reports that [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] leader [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]] had been charged with [[Treason/Legends|treason]] and fled [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]]. Beruss advocated for a New Republic [[Evacuation of Ciutric|mission]] to rescue Pestage, arguing that successfully doing so would render other Imperials more willing to defect from the declining Empire. A New Republic team secured Pestage on [[Ciutric IV|Ciutric]], only to be trapped there by Imperial forces. Although her great-nephew Avan was a participant in the endangered mission, Beruss recommended not sending reinforcements, believing any escalation of the situation would be detrimental to the\nRepublic. At the same time, Avan worried that his great-aunt was holding back reinforcements to avoid the appearance of favoritism toward him. Despite the lack of support, Avan survived the mission, which ultimately failed to keep Pestage in Republic custody.<ref name=\"MR\" />\n\nIn [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], as the New Republic was preparing for an attempt to seize Coruscant, Doman Beruss attended a meeting of the Provisional Council. There, she pointed out to the other councilors that whoever was able to claim Coruscant would be seen as the legitimate government of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], and that the [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] [[Zsinj]] had likely taken notice of the Republic's recent push toward the capital.<ref name=\"WG:4\" /> Beruss was present at another meeting the following day, in which the debate over how to approach Coruscant continued. In response to [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar's]] proposal to send a team of military specialists to Coruscant prior to the main attack, Beruss asked Airen Cracken, who specialized in such matters, if he felt prepared to handle the operation. She also expressed approval of Councilor [[Borsk Fey'lya]]'s plan to distract Imperial forces by freeing [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] operatives from [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] and releasing them on Coruscant.<ref name=\"WG:8\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'', chapter 8</ref>\n\nAfter the New Republic [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|liberated]] Coruscant, Beruss and other members of the Provisional Council convened on the world in what had once been a [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Senatorial]] apartment area. There, Beruss sat beside [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] as she heard [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] argue in defense of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Tycho Celchu]], who faced accusations of treason against the New Republic. While she claimed to respect Antilles' convictions, Beruss stated that the evidence against Celchu was sufficient to warrant a [[Trial of Tycho Celchu|trial]].<ref name=\"KT:3\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'', chapter 3</ref> At a later meeting on Coruscant, the Council debated how the Republic's [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] supply should be used to deal with an outbreak of the [[Krytos virus]], and Beruss objected when Fey'lya accused Councilor [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of anti-[[Alien/Legends|alien]] bias for her opposition to Fey'lya's proposed strategy for bacta distribution.<ref name=\"KT:11\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'', chapter 11</ref>\n\nThe Council would be active until [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], to be replaced by the first [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]]. In [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]] she was one of the signatories of ''[[Why Do We Fight the Empire?]]''.
