Despite lacking [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]], he dressed himself in [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]][[Jedi apparel|-style robes]] and carried a non-functional, pre-[[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] he'd stolen from a museum. Spurred on by the mysterious [[Lumiya|Brisha Syo]], he demanded that [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] teach him a single Jedi [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] or he'd jump from the summit of a building. After over an hour of fruitless negotiation, Jacen tired and allowed him to jump. However, Pazz's [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] attempt failed, with [[Nelani Dinn]] and [[Ben Skywalker]] managing to slow down Pazz's fall with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Pazz ended the day with a broken ankle, screaming of his betrayal by the Jedi.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Borth Pazz\n|es=Borth Pazz\n|pl=Borth Pazz\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pazz, Borth}}\n[[Category:Lorrdians]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
