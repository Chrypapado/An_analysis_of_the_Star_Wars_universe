Sometime following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Harn met with a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] directed to him by [[Trehla Keelo]], a street-smart native of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] who would aid individuals in finding suitable professional work. Harn taught the spacer some of the basics about medical work, and bestowed to the individual a [[stimpak]] to help the individual along in their travels.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I have this viewscreen reader for you.\"<br />\"Yes, thank you. I suppose you want to know why I asked to see you.\"<br />\"The thought did cross my mind.\"<br />\"I wish to explain about damage. I assume that you already know that you can heal your damage with a bacta shot. You may also use stimpacks for a quick shot of healing, even without medical training. Allow me to supply you with a stimpack to help you along the way until you buy or make your own.|A spacer and Kazen Harn|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Medic/Legends|medical]] professional and [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] by the name of Kazen Harn lived during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. By the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Harn worked at the [[Mos Eisley Medical Center]], a [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]] located in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] [[Desert/Legends|desert]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].<ref name=\"SWG:TfaB\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nThe street-smart [[Trehla Keelo]], a Human female native of Mos Eisley, took it upon herself to aid travelers in finding suitable professional work. She directed one particular [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to meet with Kazen Harn and deliver to him a [[Viewscreen/Legends|viewscreen]]. Harn accepted the viewscreen from the intrepid spacer, and then went on to explain to the individual some basic information regarding medical work. Specifically, Harn explained to the spacer that physical damage could be remedied through the use of [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] shots. He also explained that [[stimpak]]s could be used for a quick shot of healing, even in the absence of medical training. To aid the spacer in their travels, Harn provided to the spacer one such stimpak to help them along. However, Harn also cautioned that more serious damage would result in wounds that could only be remedied by spending time in medical center or by accepting the services of a trained [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]]. He urged the spacer to familiarize themselves with proper healing techniques before going out to [[Hunting/Legends|hunt]]. The spacer thanked Harn for his enlightening counsel, and returned to Trehla Keelo to seek out additional assignments.<ref name=\"SWG:TfaB\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Lastly, I want to talk to you about wounds. More serious damage can result in wounds. Only time in a medical center or a doctor can remedy that. A few wounds will not seriously impair your ability to function, but a great number of them will. Before you go out to hunt, get familiar with how to heal yourself.\"<br />\"Thank you for the warning.|Kazen Harn and a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nKazen Harn had fair skin, and brown [[Color/Legends|colored]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. As a professional, Harn was knowledgeable about medical technology, including bacta shots and stimpaks, which he was more than willing to share with others.<ref name=\"SWG:TfaB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:KazenHarn.jpg|250px|thumb|Every possible depiction of Kazen Harn]]\n{{Quote|Trehla gave me something for you, but I seem to have lost it.\"<br />\"That's all right. I will get another one. I suppose it seems strange that I would call on a stranger and then not be upset if that same stranger lost something of mine.|Dialogue between the player and Kazen Harn, if the viewscreen were to be lost|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nKazen Harn was a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TfaB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of [[W:c:swg:Publish 17 Notes for 26 May 2005|Publish 17.0]] on [[May 26]], [[2005]],<ref name=\"Publish 2005\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20081009071222}}</ref> Kazen Harn was included as part of a simple [[W:c:swg:New Player Tutorial|New Player Tutorial]] [[W:c:swg:Quest|quest]] titled \"Time for a Break\". In the quest, players were tasked by [[W:c:swg:Trehla Keelo|Trehla Keelo]] to deliver a viewscreen to Harn in [[W:c:swg:Mos Eisley|Mos Eisley]]. Upon doing so, Harn would offer the player brief information regarding how to [[W:c:swg:Heal Wound (Ability)|heal wounds]] and [[W:c:swg:Damage|damage]]. He would then provide the player with a [[W:c:swg:Stimpack A|stimpack A]] device as a reward.
