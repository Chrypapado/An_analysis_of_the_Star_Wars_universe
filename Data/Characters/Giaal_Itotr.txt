Cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Itotr resided in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] where he created two works of art, titled ''[[Krayt Dragon Skeleton]]'' and ''[[Lucky Despot Wreckage]]''. Both of these [[Painting/Legends|paintings]] were subsequently featured in the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]] by curator [[Lilas Dinhint]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Greetings friends. Have you heard about the time I crossed the Dune Sea without drinking even a single drop of water? Ha&hellip;who needs water when you've got a good Corellian ale!|Giaal Itotr, to passersby|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] by the name of Giaal Itotr lived during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a major conflict between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. He was a self-professed [[Scout/Legends|explorer]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], a [[Desert/Legends|desert]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. At one point during his travels, Itotr crossed the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]] without drinking a single drop of [[Water/Legends|water]], instead making do with [[Corellian ale/Legends|Corellian ale]]. He also single-handedly defeated an entire unit of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] at [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]], tricked an underling of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] into giving him his [[Currency/Legends|money]], and attempted to open an art gallery for [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]]. However, the latter idea was met with poor results.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"Ruins\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine]]''</ref> Itotr could usually be found in front of the [[Mos Espa hotel|hotel]] in [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]], a [[City/Legends|city]] on Tatooine. While there, he created two [[Painting/Legends|paintings]], one titled ''[[Krayt Dragon Skeleton]]'', which depicted a [[Skeleton/Legends|skeleton]] of a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]], and another titled ''[[Lucky Despot Wreckage]]'', which depicted the ''[[Lucky Despot]]'' [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]] and [[Casino/Legends|casino]] in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. Itotr used painting as a way to memorialize the thing had had seen during his travels, namely sights unique to Tatooine that had made an impression on him.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], curator [[Lilas Dinhint]] oversaw the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> which served as the planet's only [[Museum/Legends|museum]].<ref name=\"Eisley\">''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''</ref> Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Giaal Itotr was one of the artists to be considered, along with [[Vanvi Hotne]], [[Klepa Laeel]], [[Kahfr Oladi]], [[Boulo Siesi]], and [[Kolka Zteht/Legends|Kolka Zteht]]. In order to have his paintings featured in Bestine, however, Itotr required enough votes to win over his fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty [[Standard day/Legends|days]], allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the course of his artistry career, Itotr was approached by a number of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], many of whom voted for him as their artist of choice. Itotr won the art competitions at various times, allowing him the opportunity to display his paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time his paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. This allowed the opportunity for [[Architect/Legends|architecturally-inclined]] furniture makers and [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] to mass-produce copies of Itotr's paintings so that they could be purchased, [[Collector/Legends|collected]], or displayed for personal use.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:KraytDragonSkeleton.png|150px|thumb|''Krayt Dragon Skeleton'']]\n{{Quote|Hello.

He was an avid adventurer who sometimes found himself in a number of perilous situations, like crossing the Dune Sea with nothing but Corellian ale, or facing off with irate Tusken Raiders who failed to admire his attempt at creating an art gallery. He was skilled at sabacc, at least to the point of being able to win against an entire unit of stormtroopers, who he believed were terrible at the game. He was also not beneath plying money away from gullible thugs of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire]]. Itotr exhibited a friendly demeanor towards passersby, oftentimes regaling them with tales about his escapades on Tatooine.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Lucky-despot.jpg|150px|thumb|''Lucky Despot Wreckage'']]\n{{Quote|Oh, well then have you heard about the time I single-handedly defeated an entire unit of stormtroopers?
