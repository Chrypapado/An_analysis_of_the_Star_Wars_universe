I like that.|Borvo|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Borvo the Hutt''' was a powerful [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] with a [[Gender/Legends|male]] personality who operated a large and profitable [[Nal Raka Criminal Empire|business]], [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] everything from [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] to [[Spice/Legends|spices]]. As an influential figure, he had dozens of strongholds on [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] located throughout the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLike many ambitious young Hutts, Borvo left his [[Hutt Space/Legends|home space]] early in his criminal career. He found a perfect hideout in the mountains of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], a lush [[Planet/Legends|world]] with small police and security forces and far from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] watchful eyes. He and his people established a base on [[Porso Hill]], and also took over a [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighter]] [[N-1 assembly site|base]] in the mountains. Borvo and his [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Adela Tych\u00e9]] easily evaded the pathetic tracking systems of the Naboo defense net, moving huge shipments of weapons artillery and even [[Spice/Legends|spice]] to the planet.\n\nAs the young Hutt's business continued to grow under the nose of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and her administrators, he established semi-permanent operations on most other planets in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] where he did illicit business; while on Naboo he would sell [[Blaster rifle/Legends|rifles]] and [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] to hunters, all perfectly legal, as fine cover in case his presence attracted the attention of the Naboo authorities.\n\nHe was also employed by the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]].<ref name=\"EG\" />\n\n===Invasion of Naboo===\nWhen the Trade Federation [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|invaded]] Naboo in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]],<ref name=\"TNEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> [[Droid/Legends|droid]] scouts found Borvo's [[Borvo the Hutt's freighter|personal freighter]] and attacked it while it was cruising the mountains. Unable to defend itself, the ship's [[Kol Kotha|pilot]] [[Mission to the Naboo mountains|made contact]] with [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Gavyn Sykes]] and his [[Captain/Legends|captain]], [[Kael (officer)|Kael]]. Sykes saved the ship by destroying the attacking [[Armored Assault Tank|AATs]]. The treacherous Hutt [[Liberation of slave camps|pretended to help]] the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]], but he later betrayed the men by killing Kael and enslaving the locals. Lieutenant Sykes took his revenge by [[Attack on Porso Hill|blowing up]] Borvo's freighter, [[Borvo the Hutt's starfighter|starfighters]], and depots. Borvo fled to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]],<ref name=\"BFN\" /> only to return at a later date. His crime empire eventually recovered and grew during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n{{Quote|I guess you're all right to talk to. What can old Borvo do for you?|Borvo|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAs the Clone Wars passed and the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] rose to power, Borvo continued to run his criminal empire from Naboo and with the Empire's strict control of goods and weaponry, his smuggling and gunrunning operations flourished.<ref name=\"SWG\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref> At this time, Borvo was faced with much competition from various other criminal organizations on the planet.<ref name=\"SWG:EHB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Everyone Hates Borvo|Naboo}}</ref> He was also an acquaintance of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] and was known to gamble and place bets with him.<ref name=\"SWG:ORDMBBD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Old Republic Droid Modules: Borvo's Battle Droid|Naboo}}</ref> Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Borvo was known to relax in the [[Moenia/Legends|Moenia]] [[Moenia Cantina|cantina]] on Naboo. There he sent [[Mordran]] to the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] sacred place to destroy some Gungans that had crossed him.<ref name=\"SWG\" /> He had a [[Borvo's Vault|hidden base]] just outside of the town. There, he stored excess weapons and droids.<ref name=\"SWG:ORDMBBD\" /> His personal ship at that time was a [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] called the ''[[Prosperous Secret]]''.<ref name=\"Wizards\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031016hutt|text=Hutt!

The Hutt agreed to give the module if the spacer was able to pass through the defenses of his vault. The spacer accepted and finally succeed the test.<ref name=\"SWG:ORDMBBD\" /> Around that same time, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] carried out a number of assignments for Borvo and his [[Borvo's guard|guard]],<ref name=\"SWG:BG\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Borvo's Guard|Naboo}}</ref><ref name=\"SWG:BA\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Borvo's Assignments|Naboo}}</ref> including killing the Hutt's former partner, [[Montrus]]. The latter helped the [[Corellian Security Force]] agent [[Niksel Frangee]] to infiltrate Borvo's organization. Afterward, Borvo rewarded the spacer by giving an antique [[Tusken King (rank)|Tusken King]]'s [[Tusken Cycler rifle|rifle]],<ref name=\"SWG:BA\" /> a rifle stolen from [[Huff Darklighter]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].<ref name=\"SWG:FHR\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Finding Huff's Rifle|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|He's sort of like Jabba but not nearly as mean.|[[Darklighter]] guard|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n[[File:Borvo2.jpg|thumb|right|Borvo the Hutt]]\nBorvo was very similar to Jabba Desilijic Tiure, both had vast smuggling networks throughout the Outer Rim and started their crime careers at very young ages. Borvo was also the top crimelord on the planet he chose to call his home away from home, and, like Jabba, he was faced with much competition on Naboo. Also like Jabba, Borvo had an eye for dangerous creatures, such as the [[Acklay/Legends|acklay]] and [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] which he kept in his underground base. However, these creatures were used more as guards and it is unlikely, but still plausible, that Borvo fed his enemies and prisoners to them in the way Jabba was known to. Borvo also enjoyed dancing girls just as much as Jabba, though it is unknown if he owned any himself.\n\nUnlike Jabba, however, Borvo seemed more active in his business in that around the invasion of Naboo he seemed to make at least some his smuggling runs personally rather than having others do it for him. Like most Hutts, Borvo was not above betraying and exploiting others to serve his own ends. He betrayed the Naboo security forces by selling rescued prisoners as slaves and stealing [[Crystal/Legends|crystals]] from a Naboo [[Mining/Legends|mining]] site, even though they saved him and his ship. Borvo did, however, seem to hold great regard for those who impressed him and served him loyally, unlike Jabba. He hired Adela Tych\u00e9 for her great piloting skills and being fluent in Huttese and other languages. He valued Mordran for his fighting skills and found respect for a young [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] when they killed an old business partner who betrayed him.\n\nThese facts seem to support the claim that Borvo personally was not nearly as mean-spirited or cruel as Jabba, choosing instead to rule his criminal empire with generosity and esteem, much like [[Valarian/Legends|Lady Valarian]], which is most likely the cause of his great success. He even had some admiration for his enemies, when Lieutenant Sykes came after him, he admitted that he liked his attitude and offered Sykes a place at his side if he willingly surrendered, to which Sykes refused. Ultimately, despite his vast crime empire, Borvo himself seemed to keep a low profile, which he may have preferred as long as he made a profit.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBorvo first appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]]'', where he was [[Actor/Legends|voiced]] by [[Clint Bajakian]]. He later appeared in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' as an NPC, giving quests to the players.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=End Game|book=Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|bformatted=''Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace'' novelization|manual=1}} {{C|[[2012]] edition}} {{Imo}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Galactic Hunters|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|140|HUT17, ''The Hutts''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031016hutt|text=Hutt!
