Sei'lar, something of a rebel, transferred out of that school to the [[Bothan Martial Academy|Bothan Military Academy]], but the two remained friends.\n\nAfter the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] conquered [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Dan'kre moved to the world. Shortly after its conquest, she hosted a party on a luxurious [[Skyhook/Legends|skyhook]], to which Sei'lar was invited. She was delighted to reunite with Sei'lar, who was making a name for herself in [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. She was also impressed by Sei'lar's boyfriend, [[Gavin Darklighter]]. The fact that Darklighter was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] excited mild disapproval among many of the guests, but Dan'kre easily accepted him. Dan'kre eagerly caught up with her old friend at the party, though a slight commotion was made when [[Karka Kre'fey]] challenged Darklighter to a duel after Darklighter honestly answered Kre'fey when asked if the Bothan's grandfather, [[Laryn Kre'fey]], had fouled up at the [[First Battle of Borleias]]. Darklighter declined.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Liska Dan'kre\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dan'kre, Liska}}\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
