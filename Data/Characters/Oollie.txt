Oollie and Skywalker soon became friends, and she supported the Jedi when he acquired a [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] of his own and joined the races.\n\nSkywalker quickly created a reputation for himself, winning races against [[Swoop gang/Legends|gangs]] from all across the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. One [[Standard day/Legends|night]], Oollie informed Skywalker that [[Drako]], the leader of the [[Hawkbat Gang]], wished to challenge him. Skywalker accepted Drako's offer but was nearly [[Death/Legends|killed]] by the gang leader when the race began.

Since Skywalker was unfamiliar with [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] racing, Oollie explained that the winner of the race would emerge from the tunnel in a few [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]]. When Skywalker asked about the loser of the race, Oollie merely shrugged her shoulders. There was an explosion immediately after, and the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] exited the tunnel victorious, while the Sligo [[Pirate/Legends|Pirate]] leader limped out a moment later. The rest of the Sligo Pirates then left their former leader behind, and Oollie remarked that they would choose a new one.

Before long, Skywalker acquired a swoop of his own and raced several [[Standard day/Legends|nights]], winning more events than he lost. Oollie supported her friend's endeavors, and soon everyone in the underworld heard of the Jedi racer, prompting [[Swoop gang/Legends|gangs]] from all over the planet to watch him and occasionally challenge him to a race.<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\nOne night, Oollie told Skywalker that someone was looking for him. When Skywalker asked who it was, Oollie told Skywalker that it was [[Drako]], the leader of the [[Hawkbat Gang]]. Drako was one of the fastest racers on the planet, which rumors suggested was due to cheating. Oollie spotted Drako and his gang approaching, and Skywalker soon accepted the challenge. The race began an [[Standard hour/Legends|hour]] later near a [[power plant]], where a large crowd of spectators had gathered. However, Drako rigged the contest, replacing the usual [[Unidentified Gotal referee|Gotal referee]] with one of his [[Unidentified Hawkbat Gang member|gang members]]. Once the race began, Drako attempted to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Skywalker by destroying the boy's swoop with an [[Ion blaster/Legends|ion blaster]].
