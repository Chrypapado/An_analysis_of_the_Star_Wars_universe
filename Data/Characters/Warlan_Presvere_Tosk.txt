During the [[Time/Legends|time]] of [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], [[Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren|Lavina Wren]], the [[Senator/Legends|senator]] of Cularin, was set to return to the world on a visit, and along with the guard [[Gibbs]], Tosk prepared the security arrangements for her trip. Tosk [[Death/Legends|killed]] a [[veshet]], which he correctly deduced had been sent to attack Wren, and he ordered extra security precautions to be taken. Discouraged, Gibbs, who unknown to Tosk was an [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] hired to kill Wren, decided that Tosk was too competant to make a mistake, and so chose not to murder Wren during her visit.<ref name=\"Insecurities\" />\n\nWren was later imprisoned on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] by the Republic, and Tosk freed her and delivered to the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] a recording in which Wren declared that the [[Cularin system]] was seceding from the Republic. The pair then escaped from Coruscant in a stolen [[Starship/Legends|starship]], while coming under attack from [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]]. The [[Office of Republic Justice]] subsequently placed a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] of 20,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] on Tosk.<ref name=\"Home Again\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20051208HomeAgain|text=Home Again|int=Home Again|archivedate=20090603045527}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040513|text=Insecurities|int=Insecurities|archivedate=20091015234848}} {{1st}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050825idiosyncracies|text=Idiosyncrasies|int=Idiosyncrasies|archivedate=20091015235054}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20051208HomeAgain|text=Home Again|int=Home Again|archivedate=20090603045527}} {{1stID}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tosk, Warlan Presvere}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
