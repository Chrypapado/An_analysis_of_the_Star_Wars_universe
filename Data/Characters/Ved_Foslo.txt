Ved attended the [[Royal Imperial Academy]] in the [[Standard year|years]] leading up to the [[Galactic Civil War]]. His roommates were [[Thane Kyrell]] and [[Nash Windrider]]. During his [[time]] at the [[Imperial Academy|Academy]], Foslo was ranked near top of his class, showing an excellence in mechanical expertise. However, he usually fell short of ranking higher in class exercises to Kyrell and another classmate, [[Ciena Ree]], much to his chagrin.\n\nAfter graduating from the Academy in the [[Standard week|weeks]] prior to the [[Battle of Yavin]], Foslo became a top weapons expert for the Empire. Following the [[Battle of Jakku]], he designed newer weapons systems that were refitted into the [[Imperial Navy]]'s [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] making them much more powerful than ever before.\n\n==Biography==\n===Imperial cadet===\nVed Foslo was the son of the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[General]] [[Foslo]], who worked in central intelligence. When he was around sixteen [[Standard year|years]] old, the younger Foslo became an [[Imperial cadet]] at the [[Royal Imperial Academy]] on [[Coruscant]], which was regarded as the most prestigious [[Imperial Academy]] in the [[Galactic Empire]]. When the [[Jelucan]]i cadet [[Thane Kyrell]] rang the door chime outside their dormitory unit, Foslo chided him for ringing the chime to his own quarters. Foslo was cold towards the newcomer, in contrast to his [[Alderaanian]] roommate [[Nash Windrider]], who was friendly towards Thane.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\n[[File:VedCienaThaneImperialBall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ved revealed to Ciena and Thane the truth behind the laser cannon incident.]]\nDuring his time at the Royal Imperial Academy, Ved took notice of the close friendship between Thane and his fellow Jelucani [[Ciena Ree]]. Jealous of the two cadet's high marks, Foslo once taunted Thane for allowing Ciena to claim the top spot in the flying class. When Thane responded that there was room for more than one of them in the graduation class and reminded him that the Empire wanted to create the best [[Imperial officer|officers]], Ved responded that one day he would understand. Nash then pointed out that Foslo was jealous of Thane and Ciena's higher marks and mockingly asked Foslo about his father's rank.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nLater, Foslo attended a [[Small Craft Flight]] class which involved the cadets riding [[speeder bike]]s through [[Reitgen Hoop]]s. When Ciena and Thane managed to win the race despite their speeder bikes being stuck together, Foslo threw his helmet down in disgust while the other cadets cheered.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nWhen the cadets were tasked with the [[laser cannon]] project, Foslo was determined to succeed. When [[Commander]] [[Harn (Imperial)|Harn]] began judging the projects, he described Foslo's efforts as \"innovative,\" which greatly pleased him. When it was revealed that Thane's project had been sabotaged, Thane and Ciena initially believed that he had been the one who sabotaged it due to his constant antagonism. In truth, the sabotage had been perpetrated by the Academy's [[Office of Student Outcomes]], which wanted to discourage local loyalties among the student population.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nPrior to graduation, Foslo along with Thane, Ciena, and [[Jude Edivon]] were among a select group of Imperial cadets invited to attend a ball at the [[Imperial Palace]], the residence of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and the former [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]]. During the function, Foslo took the opportunity to wear the latest Coruscant fashion: a long cape, wide silky shirt, and other accessories. At the ball, Foslo mocked Thane and Ciena for letting their relationship be affected by the laser cannon incident. He revealed that the Academy's cadets had engineered the incident in order to weaken local ties and to strengthen their commitment to the Empire. Despite Foslo's harsh tone, Thane and Ciena realized that he was right and reconciled.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\n===Imperial service===\nAfter graduating from the Royal Imperial Academy, Ved Foslo became a weapons expert who developed new weapons for the [[Imperial Navy]]. Following the [[Battle of Jakku]], he developed [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] that were capable of punching through energy shields and starfighter hulls with a single blast. Following the [[Battle of Jakku]], Foslo along with his former roommate Commander Nash Windrider joined the [[Queluhan Nebula Imperial remnant|Imperial remnant]] that regrouped in the [[Queluhan Nebula]] for an assault on the [[New Republic]], the successor to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" /> At some point in his service within the Empire, Foslo piloted a [[TIE Advanced x1]].<ref name=\"X-wing\">*{{FFGXW2|Galactic Empire Conversion Kit|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Ved_Foslo|cardname=Ved Foslo}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Ved_Foslo_Ambitious_Engineer_TIE_Adv_x1_XW2.png|thumb|right|250px|Foslo piloting a TIE Advanced x1]]\nVed Foslo was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]]. In his youth, he had a slim physique, black hair, and a narrow face. Foslo liked to boast of his father General Foslo's high ranking position. As a [[Core Worlds|Core Worlder]], Foslo looked down on people from the [[Outer Rim Territories]] such as Thane Kyrell and Ciena. According to Thane, he never relaxed and even wore his pajamas to the neck. Foslo was known for his clean habits, his lack of a snoring problem, and his knowledge of the fine points of military culture on Coruscant. Foslo was also familiar with the night clubs on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nIn his youth, Foslo liked to keep up with fashion. While Nash believed that Foslo had risen through the ranks due to his father's interference, Foslo had a technical aptitude and became a weapons expert. While Nash chafed under Foslo's adolescent arrogance, he regarded Foslo's arrogance as completely insufferable in adulthood. Still, Nash regarded Foslo as preferable to his former friend Thane Kyrell, who had joined the Rebel Alliance and New Republic.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVed Foslo first appeared in the [[canon]] novel ''[[Lost Stars]]'', as part of [[Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens]], which was written by [[Claudia Gray]] and published in [[2015]].\n\nWhile writing the novel, Gray pictured Foslo as being portrayed by [[Wikipedia:Harry Shum Jr.|Harry Shum Jr.]].{{Fact}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lost Stars]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Lost Stars (audiobook)|''Lost Stars'' audiobook]]\n*[[Lost Stars (webcomic)|''Lost Stars'' webcomic]] {{1stp}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|misspelt as Ved Falco}}\n*{{FFGXW2|Galactic Empire Conversion Kit|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Ved_Foslo|cardname=Ved Foslo}} {{C|Reissued in ''[[TIE Advanced x1 Expansion Pack]]''}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ved Foslo#kanon\n|fr=Ved Foslo\n|ja=\u30f4\u30a7\u30c9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30b9\u30ed\n|ko=\ubca0\ub4dc \ud3ec\uc2ac\ub85c\n|ru=\u0412\u0435\u0434 \u0424\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foslo, Ved}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
