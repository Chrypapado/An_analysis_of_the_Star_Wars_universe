In the meantime return to your respective sectors and prepare for our next phase. Once Darth Sidious is dead, the galaxy will be ours for the taking.|Ziton Moj, Fife, and Darth Maul|Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 4}}\n'''Ziton Moj''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[Falleen]] who worked as a [[Vigo]] for the [[Black Sun]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He served as [[Captain of the Guard]], however later, the Black Sun became a member of [[Maul]]{{'s}} [[Shadow Collective]] after [[Savage Opress]], Maul's brother, [[Death|killed]] the leaders of Black Sun for refusing to join Maul's cause. Due to this, Moj became the subsequent leader of the Black Sun, and as a member of the Shadow Collective, Moj fought during the [[Death Watch]] [[Takeover of Mandalore|coup]] on [[Mandalore]] to help further the Shadow Collective's goals.\n\nAs a leader of Black Sun, Ziton attempted to force the [[Pyke Syndicate]]'s leader [[Marg Krim]] to merge their two syndicates. When Krim refused, Ziton kidnapped Krim's family in an effort to force Krim to reconsider his decision. Ziton kept Krim's wife [[Tezzka Krim]] and their children [[Vram (Pyke)|Vram]] and [[Laalee]] hostage at the [[Black Sun fortress]] on [[Mustafar]]. However, the bounty hunters [[Asajj Ventress]] and [[Quinlan Vos]] rescued Krim's family and returned them to their father. In retaliation, the Black Sun sent a fleet to attack the Pyke Syndicate's stronghold on [[Oba Diah]].\n\nAfter Maul was released from [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|the Spire]], the Shadow Collective reemerged fully, and Moj helped fight in the [[Battle of Ord Mantell|battle]] on [[Ord Mantell]] against the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], before pulling Black Sun out of the Collective during the [[Second Battle of Dathomir]]. However, he and Black Sun later rejoined, as did the Pykes. During the [[Siege of Mandalore]] he, Pyke leader Marg Krim, and [[Dryden Vos]] of [[Crimson Dawn]] were ordered to go into hiding by Maul.\n\n==Biography==\n===Joining the Shadow Collective===\n{{Quote|It would seem the decision to join us is now yours.''\"<br />\"''After careful consideration, we will join you.|Maul and Ziton Moj|Eminence (episode)|Eminence}}\nIn [[19 BBY]],<ref name=\"SWGA\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> former Sith Lord [[Maul]], [[Savage Opress]], and [[Death Watch]] arrived on the [[planet]] [[Mustafar]], which was where Moj and the leaders of [[Black Sun]] were based. Moj met with the intruders with a [[battalion]] of [[Black Sun Guard|Black Sun foot soldiers]], and Maul requested an audience with the leaders of Black Sun. Moj believed that the meeting would end with the [[death]]s of the interlopers, but allowed them to enter. Maul, Savage, and the leader of Death Watch, [[Pre Vizsla]], entered the chambers of [[Xomit Grunseit]] and the other leaders, but they refused to join Maul's [[Shadow Collective]]. Due to this, Maul had Savage throw his [[Savage Opress's lightsaber|double-bladed lightsaber]] across the table, killing every one of the leaders sat there. This move left Moj the highest ranking member of Black Sun, and due to the display he had witnessed he decided to join Maul, which officially brought the Black Sun into the Shadow Collective.<ref name=\"Eminence\" />\n\nMaul would then receive the support of the [[Pyke Syndicate]] and the [[Hutt Clan]],<ref name=\"Eminence\" /> and with these assets backing him the [[Sith]] put his plan into motion. Moj was present for a briefing given by Maul, which outlined their plan. Moj, his [[Black Sun Guard|Black Sun foot soldiers]], Savage, and the [[Pyke]]s would attack the [[Mandalorian]] capital of [[Sundari]], and this would be used to make the current ruler of [[Mandalore]], [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]], look weak. Satine's pacifist government would fail to hold back the attack, but then Death Watch would arrive and \"stop\" the criminals. This move would put Pre Vizsla into power, and remove Satine, allowing Death Watch to rule the planet, the long standing goal of that organization.<ref name=\"ShadesOfReason\">{{TCW|Shades of Reason}}</ref> With this Maul planned to expand in the shadows with support from Vizsla.<ref name=\"Eminence\" />\n\n[[File:FalsePrisoners.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Moj with [[Lom Pyke]] and Savage Oppress as \"prisoners\"]]\nMoj and the rest of the attackers arrived on Mandalore, and caused their disruptions across the [[city]] from the docks all the way to locations like [[Peace Park]]. Moj's team was \"stopped\" by [[Bo-Katan Kryze]] and her group of Mandalorian soldiers. The other groups were ultimately \"stopped\" by Death Watch also well in accordance to the plan, and Moj and several others were shown as \"[[prisoner]]s\" to the public.<ref name=\"ShadesOfReason\" />\n\nUltimately Vizsla betrayed Maul to try to focus solely on Mandalore, but due to this Vizsla was killed by Maul. This move put Maul in charge of Death Watch, and with this they transitioned to be the [[Mandalorian super commando]]s.<ref name=\"ShadesOfReason\" /> Maul's plan was ultimately put on hold however, due to his old master: [[Darth Sidious]]. Sidious killed Savage, and captured Maul.<ref name=\"The Lawless\">{{TCW|The Lawless}}</ref> This meant that Moj and Maul's other allies would have to wait for the Sith's rescue until moving forward.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 2\">[[Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 2|''Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir'' 2]]</ref>\n\n===The Pykes and bounty hunters===\n{{Quote|I have a message from the Pykes. Don't ever put family in the middle of this again.|Asajj Ventress trashing Ziton|Dark Disciple}}\nLater in 19 BBY, Ziton contacted [[Marg Krim]], the leader of the [[Pyke]] Syndicate, and offered to merge their two crime syndicates. Wanting to protect [[Gender|his]] business and unwilling to lose face with his syndicate, Krim rejected the offer. Zim responded by kidnapping Krim's [[Marriage|wife]] [[Tezzka Krim|Tezzka]] and their two children [[Vram (Pyke)|Vram]] and [[Laalee]]. He imprisoned them at the [[Black Sun fortress]] on Mustafar, a [[Volcano|volcanic]] [[planet]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]]. During their captivity, Ziton ordered that Tezzka be forcibly separated from her children and brought to his [[Ziton's palace|palace]] quarters.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, Krim hired two [[bounty hunter]]s&mdash;the [[Dathomirian]] [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] [[Asajj Ventress]] and the undercover [[Jedi Master]] [[Quinlan Vos]] to [[Rescue of Marg Krim's family|rescue]] his family. The two [[Force-sensitive]] bounty hunters managed to infiltrate the fortress and rescue Vram and Laalee. An unhappy Ziton learned about the rescue twenty [[Standard minute|minutes]] later and gave orders to his [[aide]] [[Kurg Utal]] to [[Death|execute]] Tezzka in order to send a \"message\" to her husband. Before they could carry out the execution, Ziton received a visit from Ventress, who posed as a Pyke Syndicate \"envoy.\"<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nWhen the \"envoy\" demanded to see Krim's wife and children, Ziton responded that he could show them Tezzka but that the children would have to wait. Ziton then secretly ordered Kurg to bring the wife so that he could execute her in the envoy's presence. After Kurg had left, he confronted Ventress, recognizing her as one of the intruders who had rescued the children. Shortly later, Tezzka entered the room accompanied by Quinlan, a man sporting a \"strange [[Color|yellow]] [[tattoo]]\" across his face. Recognizing Vos as an intruder, Ziton attempted to reach for his [[blaster]] but Ventress shot it out of his hand.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nVos and Ventress quickly overpowered Ziton's [[Falleen]] guards. Ziton attempted to fight against Ventress with his combat arts skills but the Force-sensitive woman bested him and also [[Force choke]]d him. Before leaving, she warned him not to harm the [[Krim]] family again and hurled him against his own throne. The hunters and Tezzka then took the opportunity to escape the palace in Ventress' [[Starship|ship]] [[Banshee (starship)|''Banshee'']]. Ziton ordered his remaining guards to pursue them but the intruders managed to escape with their hostages back to the Pyke stronghold of [[Oba Diah]]. In retaliation, Black Sun sent a fleet of [[starfighter]]s and [[Interceptor-class frigate|''Interceptor''-class frigates]] to \"teach Krim a lesson.\"<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n===Return of the Shadow Collective===\nDespite Maul's previous capture and the [[Hutt]]s abandoning the Shadow Collective, the Pykes and Black Sun did remain loyal to Maul's Shadow Collective.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 1\">[[Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 1|''Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Darth_maul_speaks_with_fife_and_ziton_moj.png|thumb|220x220px|Maul speaks with Fife and Moj on Ord Mantell]]\nSince his capture on Mandalore, Maul had been held at the prison known as the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]], where he was tortured by Darth Sidious and Sidious's current apprentice Darth [[Dooku|Tyranus]], more widely known as [[Count]] Dooku. The pair tortured Maul in order to find the location of [[Mother (title)|Mother]] [[Talzin]], who was secretly behind Maul's return and was seen as a threat by Sidious. The prison was run by Dooku's government, the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], but two of Maul's Mandalorian [[commando]]s, [[Rook Kast]] and [[Gar Saxon]] were ordered by [[Almec]] able to break in and rescue Maul. This was [[Escape from the Spire|done]], and Maul was returned to Mandalorians on [[Zanbar]], but they were quickly found by the CIS. [[General]] [[Grievous]] [[Battle of Zanbar|attacked]] the location, and many of Maul's Mandalorian [[troop]]s were killed in the battle.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 1\" /> Due to this, Maul and his remaining Mandalorians retreated to [[Ord Mantell]], which was where Black Sun had a base.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 2\" />\n\nMoj meet with Maul in the [[city]], and [[Fife]] of the Pyke Syndicate meet with them as well. Maul told them that they would soon engage the [[Confederacy military]]. Maul had Kast brief Moj and Fife on his plan, and after a group of [[Nightbrothers]] arrived to reinforce them, the Separatists arrived. The Shadow Collective [[Battle of Ord Mantell|engaged]] the [[Separatist Droid Army]] in the city, as Maul fought his way onto Grievous's [[dreadnought]], the ''[[Invisible Hand]]''. Maul forced Grievous to shut down the [[droid]] [[army]], and Dooku was captured by Shadow Collective forces after fighting the Nightbothers.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 2\" />\n\n===Leaving the Shadow Collective===\nZiton then began to get impatient with Maul, as he saw that the collective was being used more for Maul's personal goals. Maul assured him and Fife that their organizations would receive their money, ordering Moj and Fife to return to their sectors. Maul returned to Dathmoir with the captured Dooku, but they were then [[Second Battle of Dathomir|attacked]] by Sidious and Grievous,<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 4\">[[Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 4|''Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir'' 4]]</ref> who had been freed previously.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 3\">[[Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 3|''Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir'' 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Kast_speaks_with_Moj_and_Pyke.png|thumb|220x220px|left|Moj and Fife speak with Rook Kast]]\nConcurrently, the Confederacy launched an [[attack on the Black Sun]], and Ziton contacted Maul's ship in an attempt to discuss their plan. As Maul was fighting Sidious and Grievous, Rook Kast was forced to speak with Ziton and Fife, who also contacted Maul's ship due to a Separatist [[Attack on the Pyke Syndicate|assault]] on the Pykes. Seeing that Maul was not going to deploy his fleet to aid them and believing that the entire collective had become a liability, Ziton broke the Black Sun's ties with the Shadow Collective. At the same time, Fife broke the Pyke's ties with the collective as well. The two deactivated their [[hologram]]s, officially disbanding the collective. With this, the only forces left under Maul's control were his Mandalorians.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 4\" />\n\n===Rejoining the Collective===\n[[File:SyndicateLeadersGoHide-TPA.png|thumb|right|250px|Maul orders his syndicate's leaders into hiding.]]\nHowever, by the time of the [[Siege of Mandalore]] the Black Sun and Moj were once more a part of Maul's Shadow Collective, along with the Pykes and [[Crimson Dawn]]. At the height of the siege, Maul contacted his Collective via hologram, informing Moj, Marg Krim, and [[Dryden Vos]] to take their respective criminal factions into hiding to wait out the disarray that would be brought on by the end of the Clone Wars, which Maul had foreseen in visions.<ref name=\"The Phantom Apprentice\">{{TCW|The Phantom Apprentice}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Go forward with our plan, but bring the wife here.

He was displeased when Marg Krim, the leader of the Pyke Syndicate, rejected what he termed as a \"very lucrative offer\" to combine the Pyke Syndicate with the Black Sun. Moj's desire to gain control of the Pyke Syndicate's [[spice]] distribution operations led him to kidnap Krim's family. Ziton was even willing to kill his hostages in order to force Marg to capitulate to his demands. Moj was infuriated and embarrassed when Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos successfully rescued Krim's family. This attack led the Black Sun to launch a retaliatory strike on the Pykes.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nZiton Maj was well versed in several different types of martial arts. He also specialized in mixing styles in a way that made it hard for his enemies to predict his next move.

Despite the cancellation of ''The Clone Wars'' TV series in March 2014, Ziton's story was expanded in two ''[[The Clone Wars Legacy]]'' projects: [[Jeremy Barlow]]'s [[2014]] comic story ''[[Star Wars: Darth Maul\u2014Son of Dathomir]]'' and [[Christie Golden]]'s ''[[Dark Disciple]]'' novel; which were both based on unproduced ''Clone Wars'' episodes.
