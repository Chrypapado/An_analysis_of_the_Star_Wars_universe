Watch your own back, hotshot.|Sunnar Jan-lo and Keyan Farlander|X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide}}\n'''Sunnar Jan-lo''' was a [[Agamarian|native]] of [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] and a member of the [[Agamar Resistance]] who joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] after attending a recruitment speech by the Rebel [[Chief of State (Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]]. Solidly built, decisive, and energetic, Jan-lo had been a leader on her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] prior to joining the Alliance. Although she wanted to pursue a career in intelligence, she initially served as a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], seeing action fighting against forces of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] during and after the Imperial offensive [[Operation Strike Fear]].\n\nJan-lo flew as pilot [[Keyan Farlander/Legends|Keyan Farlander's]] [[Wingmate/Legends|wingmate]] in an [[Battle of the Circarpous system (Galactic Civil War)|attack]] on the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Intrepid (Imperial I-class)|''Intrepid'']] after it became stranded and defenseless in the [[Circarpous system/Legends|Circarpous system]]. Her [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] fighter was hit by a [[Concussion missile/Legends|missile]] during the mission, and, although she managed to eject, she suffered burns and cuts over her face, [[Limb/Legends|arms]], and legs. She spent the following days in a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]] and was grounded afterward. Being unable to fly gave her the opportunity to enter intelligence training. She eventually transferred to [[Alliance Intelligence]] shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Joining the Alliance===\n[[File:Independence.png|thumb|left|250px|Jan-lo was trained aboard the ''Independence''.]]\nA native of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] during the [[Imperial Period|Imperial era]], the [[Gender/Legends|female]] Sunnar Jan-lo joined the local anti-[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Agamar Resistance|resistance movement]] and quickly became a natural leader within the organization.

''X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide'' establishes that the [[Battle of Tatooine  (Galactic Civil War)|capture of Leia Organa]] occurs at the end of ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]''{{'s}} second tour of duty. Organa's capture takes place on 35:3:3 under the [[Great ReSynchronization]] dating system, placing it at the beginning of [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] according to [[Template:YearMathGRS|the following explanation]]. Events in ''X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide'' before the end of the second tour of duty therefore take place in 1 BBY.</ref> [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] [[Chief of State (Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] visited Agamar to negotiate bringing the resistance into the wider Rebellion. Mothma gave a speech to members of the resistance at a rally in the Agamarian [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Calna Muun]] prior to negotiations with the resistance leaders, but Jan-lo took little convincing and was one of four Agamarians who decided to enlist immediately with the Alliance.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nFollowing the rally, Jan-lo boarded a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] along with the other new recruits&mdash;[[Keyan Farlander/Legends|Keyan Farlander]], [[Breth Gart]], and [['Ndranth Poussan]]&mdash;and traveled to the waiting [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]] [[Independence/Legends|''Independence'']]. The shuttle landed in a [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] toward the rear of the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] [[Starship/Legends|vessel]], and the recruits were taken to a waiting room, before being shown to their quarters and assigned liaison [[Officer/Legends|officers]] for the duration of their training. Though Jan-lo wanted to work in [[Alliance Intelligence]], senior Alliance personnel felt that there was a greater need for [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] at that [[Time/Legends|time]], and she was assigned to the [[Alliance Starfighter Corps]] along with the other new recruits. Her basic training began with flight maneuvers in the [[The Maze (pilot proving ground)|pilot proving grounds]], before she moved on to [[Holosimulator|simulated]] [[Starfighter combat/Legends|combat]] scenarios under [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Wex Dafid|Wex \"TIE-Die\" Dafid]].<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\n===First mission===\n{{Quote|You're not the only one who can pass the training, you know.|Jan-lo, to Farlander, before her first mission|X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide}}\nJan-lo proved to be a competent pilot,<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|138|Jan-lo, Sunnar}}</ref> performing better than Poussan in training. Before long, Farlander was selected for active duty and was soon followed by Poussan, who was selected for the [[Battle of Brigia (Galactic Civil War)|evacuation]] of the [[Brigia Rebel base|Rebel base]] on [[Brigia/Legends|Brigia]], despite his lack of experience, due to a shortage of available pilots. Jan-lo herself went on to active duty shortly after the evacuation and was assigned to [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Red Squadron]] aboard the ''Independence''. She was reunited with Farlander, also a member of Red [[Squadron/Legends|Squadron]], during her first mission briefing and delivered the news that Poussan had been [[Death/Legends|killed]] at Brigia and that Gart had washed out of training with [[disorientation syndrome]].<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nThe Alliance had learned that the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Invincible (Strike Fear)|''Invincible'']], the [[Command ship/Legends|command vessel]] of the Imperial offensive known as [[Operation Strike Fear]], was low on supplies following the attack on Brigia and was looking to resupply before a planned attack on [[Rudrig/Legends|Rudrig]].<ref name=\"XW\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]''</ref> Jan-lo's first mission, in which she flew alongside Farlander and two pilots from [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Blue Squadron]], was to [[Raid on the Juno convoy|ambush]] a supply [[Convoy/Legends|convoy]] heading for the ''Invincible'', setting back the Imperial campaign by several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]]. Upon exiting [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] near the ''Invincible'', Farlander sent Jan-lo to intercept the convoy's [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighter]] and [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE interceptor]] escorts in her [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]], joining her after firing his full [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton torpedo]] load at the escorting [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] [[Ranger (CR90 corvette)|''Ranger'']]. The two continued to dogfight the Imperial fighters while Blue Squadron's [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-wings]] engaged the [[BFF-1 bulk freighter/Legends|BFF-1 bulk freighters]] of [[Juno (freighter group)|Juno group]]. When the fighters were destroyed, the X-wing pilots helped to finish off the [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]] before the Rebel forces returned to the ''Independence''.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\n===Operation Strike Fear===\nAround this time, [[Ordnance and Supply/Legends|Ordnance and Supply Command]] alerted all Alliance forces that their supplies of [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droids]]&mdash;which provided pilot support and [[Computer/Legends|computer]] functions in starfighters&mdash;were running low. When the Alliance learned of a shipment of Imperial [[R2-series astromech droid]]s aboard the freighter ''[[Ars Opus]]'', forces from the ''Independence'' were dispatched to [[Raid in the Rudrig system|capture]] the [[Droid/Legends|droids]]. The new droids were quickly put to use in a three-ship X-wing patrol. Though Jan-lo was not assigned to the patrol, she was working in the ship's Operations Section when they received a message indicating that the X-wings were out of control. Knowing that Farlander's friend, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Hamo Blastwell]], was one of the pilots involved, Jan-lo contacted her fellow Agamarian to warn him. It soon emerged that the droids had been sabotaged with hidden [[Programmer/Legends|programming]] that would cause them to take over the X-wings they were put in and deliver them to the Empire, but the Rebels were able to safely [[Mission to recover stolen X-wings|retrieve]] the ships before they could fall into Imperial hands.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\n[[File:GunboatTesting.png|thumb|right|250px|Jan-lo's A-wing interrupts Assault Gunboat performance trials.]]\nThe Rebels later conducted a series of operations to bring the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustans]] into the Alliance. For his part in these missions, Farlander was promoted to captain and Jan-lo helped organize a party to celebrate her friend's promotion.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" /> The Sullustans worked with [[General/Legends|General]] [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]] of [[Alliance Special Forces/Legends|Alliance Special Forces]] to devise a plan to end Operation Strike Fear by [[Destruction of the Invincible|destroying]] the ''Invincible''. The first part of the plan called for the capture of members of the [[Cygnus Spaceworks/Legends|Cygnus Spaceworks]] design staff to make special modifications to one of their [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class shuttles]].<ref name=\"XW\" /> Jan-lo was assigned as Farlander's [[Wingmate/Legends|wingmate]] in a two-ship [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor/Legends|A-wing]] [[Flight group|group]] charged with escorting the [[Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transport|''Delta''-class transport]] [[Lightning (Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transport)|''Lightning'']] as it captured the Cygnus staff while they conducted starfighter performance trials. The two [[Rebel pilot/Legends|Rebel pilots]] emerged from hyperspace to find several inactive [[TIE Series]] fighters in the area, along with one heavily [[Deflector shield/Legends|shielded]] fighter of an unfamiliar design, which Jan-lo dubbed a \"[[Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wing/Legends|Gunboat]].\" Jan-lo quickly targeted the TIEs before they could power up, while Farlander scanned the nearby [[Transport/Legends|transports]] to locate the design staff<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />&mdash;the Gunboat retreated to hyperspace when confronted.<ref name=\"XW\" /> By the time the ''Lightning'' entered the area and moved to board the designers' transport, TIE fighters were beginning to scramble in response to the attack. However, Jan-lo and Farlander kept them from the ''Lightning'' until it completed its mission, and the Rebels jumped back into hyperspace, reporting the unusual sighting upon their return to the ''Independence''.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\n===A new threat===\nThe Rebels were ultimately successful in destroying the ''Invincible'' and putting an end to Operation Strike Fear, but news of a greater threat soon emerged. Following the [[Rescue from Stars' End|rescue]] of a group of Rebel pilots from [[Stars' End/Legends|Stars' End]] [[Prison/Legends|prison]], the escapees brought news of a shipment of [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] to an [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Imperial construction project]]. One of the escaped pilots, Captain [[Samuel Raider]], outlined a plan to rescue the Wookiees during a briefing led by the ''Independence''{{'s}} planning officer, Commander [[H. S'man|S'man]], and selected Jan-lo and Farlander to accompany him on the mission. However, when Raider's fellow escapee [[Toalagar]] asked to get straight back into active duty, Raider decided to take him instead of Jan-lo. Toalagar was killed during the mission.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nJan-lo continued to serve with Red Squadron while the Rebels attempted to learn more about the Imperial construction project. After veteran pilot Captain [[Puck Naeco/Legends|Puck Naeco]] was transferred to the squadron, he started a series of practical jokes aimed at his wingmates. Knowing that Naeco was attracted to Jan-lo, the other pilots recruited her help in gaining their revenge. Jan-lo struck up a conversation with Naeco and told him to meet her privately in a storage shed in the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] section of the ship. When Naeco entered the dark room, Jan-lo called him over and told him to kiss her. Only when he did so did the hidden pilots turn the lights on to reveal that he was kissing a Quarren kitchen worker who was in on the joke.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\n===Battle in the Circarpous system===\n{{Quote|Take good care of her. She's my friend.|Keyan Farlander, to a medical droid, following Jan-lo's injury|X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide}}\n[[File:Intrepid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rebel X-wings go into battle against the ''Intrepid''.]]\nFollowing the capture of the [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] to the Empire's new [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] [[battlestation]]&mdash;the Imperial construction project of which the Alliance had previously learned&mdash;shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], the Alliance learned that the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Intrepid (Imperial I-class)|''Intrepid'']] had been damaged in a collision with a [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] and was awaiting repairs to its [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]]. The ''Independence'' launched a [[Battle of the Circarpous system (Galactic Civil War)|series of raids]] that prevented these repairs and left the ''Intrepid'' stranded in the [[Circarpous system/Legends|Circarpous system]]. The Rebels soon launched a direct starfighter assault on the ''Intrepid''.<ref name=\"XW\" /> The battle plan combined X-wings from Red Squadron, Y-wings from Blue Squadron, and A-wings from [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Gold Squadron]], with Jan-lo assigned to an X-wing as Farlander's wing.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nUpon entering the Circarpous [[Star system/Legends|system]], Farlander instructed Jan-lo to target the TIE fighters launching from the ''Intrepid'' while the Y-wings began their run on the Star Destroyer. Once the first wave of TIE fighters was eliminated, Jan-lo and Farlander turned toward an oncoming wave of [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]]. Farlander's target survived his first pass, but Jan-lo was able to pick it off. However, another [[Bomber/Legends|bomber]] was able to lock a [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missile]] on her X-wing. Jan-lo managed to eject as the [[Missile/Legends|missile]] struck and destroyed her starfighter, but she was left with burns to her face and seared patches and deep gouges in her [[Limb/Legends|arms]] and legs. Despite their losses, the Rebels were successful in destroying the ''Intrepid''. Following the battle, Jan-lo was picked up and taken back to the ''Independence'', where she spent the next few days receiving medical treatment in one of the ship's [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tanks]]. Her recovery went well, and she was soon looking forward to making her return to active duty. Farlander and Naeco were among the pilots who visited her during her convalescence.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nBy the time Rebel leader [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] was [[Battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|captured]]<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" /> over [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] while delivering the Death Star plans to the [[Great Temple/Legends|Rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Jan-lo had recovered from her injuries but was not cleared for active flight duty. Jan-lo's grounding allowed the pilot to pursue her intelligence training; she was transferred to Alliance Intelligence and was sent on a classified assignment that would take her away from the ''Independence'' for some time.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Those are my favorites. I just like how easy it is to blast them.|Jan-lo discusses TIE fighters|X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide}}\nJan-lo was solidly built, decisive, and energetic. A committed member of the Agamar Resistance, she did not hesitate to join the Rebel Alliance following Mon Mothma's rally. Her determination was shown in the speed with which she recovered from the injuries sustained against the ''Intrepid'' and her desire to get back into a [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]]. She was calm and often quiet&mdash;even sitting in silence on her first trip to the ''Independence''&mdash;typically keeping her comments short and to the point. While getting revenge on Naeco for his practical jokes, the atypically seductive tone in Jan-lo's voice took Keyan Farlander by surprise.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nDespite her quiet nature, Jan-lo was always a leader on her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], and this trait continued after joining the Alliance. Upon first arriving aboard the ''Independence'', Jan-lo helped to reassure 'Ndranth Poussan and Breth Gart when they were nervous, and the typically insular Gart confided in her about his desire to try again after failing his initial flight training. Jan-lo had a good relationship with her wingmates, particularly her fellow Agamarian Keyan Farlander and Naeco, who was noticeably attracted to her. She helped to organize a party to celebrate Farlander's promotion to captain and made sure to seek him out to let him know about her transfer to Alliance Intelligence. When she was recovering from her injuries, both Farlander and Naeco visited her.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\nThough Jan-lo decided she wanted to work in intelligence soon after joining the Alliance, she undertook flight training to help fill a shortage of pilots<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" /> and became a competent pilot in her own right.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> She particularly liked fighting against standard TIE fighters, as she found them to be easy targets.<ref name=\"XW:OSG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSunnar Jan-lo was created by [[Rusel DeMaria]] for the [[1993]] book ''[[X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide]]'', which presented the story of Keyan Farlander, the player-character in the [[Video game|game]] ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]''.
