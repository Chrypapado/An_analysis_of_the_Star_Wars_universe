War always makes a profit.|Kamka Lira, on Kasif's sales|Star Wars: Datapad}}\n'''Kasif''' was a [[Trandoshan]] [[Gender|male]] [[Hunting|hunter]] and [[merchant]] who operated in the town of [[Black Spire Outpost]] on the [[planet]] [[Batuu]]. He ran the company known as [[Outer Rim Expedition and Supply]], selling goods that included [[starship]]s and weaponry.\n\nDuring the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]], a supply cart operated by Kasif was visited by the Resistance [[spy]] [[Vi Moradi]], who the Trandoshan attempted to scam until threatened by [[Black Spire Station]] proprietor [[Salju]]. Kasif also sold out the [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]] to the [[mercenary]] [[Bazine Netal]], who visited Batuu in search of Ohnaka. After the First Order occupied Batuu, Kasif saw an increase in sales and enjoyed the extra profit regardless of the reason behind it.\n\n==Biography==\n===Trandoshan trader===\n[[File:ORES.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kasif was the owner of the company Outer Rim Expedition and Supply.]]\nIn [[34 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date\">''[[The Star Wars Book]]'' dates the [[Battle of Batuu]], depicted in the [[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]] themed land via the attraction ''[[Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance]]'', to the same [[Standard year|year]] as the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]], which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' places in [[34 ABY]].

He gifted the wampa to a friend of his, the [[Ithorian]] [[collector]] [[Dok-Ondar]], who kept it in his store, [[Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities]].<ref name=\"TGTB\">''[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: Traveler's Guide to Batuu]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]], the Resistance [[spy]] [[Vi Moradi]] was tasked by [[General]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] with finding a new base of operations; she eventually chose Batuu, but her [[starship]] crashed upon arrival, and her belongings and supplies were [[Thief|stolen]] by thugs working for the local [[Crime lord|crime boss]], [[Oga Garra]]. [[Salju]], the proprietor of [[Black Spire Station]], set out to help Moradi acquire new supplies, visiting Kasif's supply cart to buy [[sleeping bag]]s. Kasif attempted to deceive Moradi into paying a high price for what he claimed was the latest innovation in sleeping bags&mdash;which, in reality, were used and lightly ragged&mdash;but Salju interrupted the merchant, threatening to raise Kasif's [[fuel]] prices at Black Spire Station. Flustered by the threat, Kasif brought out the sleeping bags, revealing their true condition and swearing that nobody had [[Death|died]] in them. Moradi bought two sleeping bags before she and Salju departed.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire\" />\n\nWhen the [[mercenary]] [[Bazine Netal]] visited Black Spire Outpost in search of [[Hondo Ohnaka]], [[pirate]] and owner of [[Ohnaka Transport Solutions]], she encountered Kasif in the middle of running his company.

At some point during the occupation, he spoke with fellow merchant [[Kamka Lira]], who lamented at having trouble with importing goods due to the First Order. Kasif did not share Lira's complaints about the First Order's presence and instead bragged about his increased sales, prompting Lira to accuse him of profiting from war.<ref name=\"DatapadKasif\">{{DatapadCite|Life in the Outpost|LifeInTheOutpost4-GEDatapad.jpg}}</ref>\n\nAt some point during the occupation, Kasif was not present at his establishment.
