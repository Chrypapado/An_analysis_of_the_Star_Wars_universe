Due to the framing, the troupe members were forced into hiding on Pijal's moon, where they gathered evidence that the attacks blamed on the Opposition had been carried out by [[blackguard]]s, a secret division of [[Royal guard (Pijal)|royal guards]] loyal to Pijal's [[Prince]]ss [[Fanry]]. During their [[Mission to Pijal|mission]] to Pijal to investigate the Opposition, [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], were attacked by blackguards while on the planet's moon. The [[Jedi]]'s escape from their assailants was aided by members of the performance troupe, including Reckly.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nAzucca led the Jedi and her colleagues to a nearby [[Opposition hideout|hideout]], where she explained that the Opposition had entirely peaceful intentions. The troupe leader detailed that her organization's members had been framed for the recent attacks on Czerka facilities that had been committed by blackguards. A young [[Unidentified Opposition member|Opposition member]] corroborated Azucca's claim to the Jedi, citing their members' innocuous former professions, including Reckly's training as a drummer. Azucca later gave Jinn a file containing evidence concerning the blackguards, which Reckly had helped collect, for use in the Jedi's investigation.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Political art.

He protested the signing of the Governance Treaty, a motion he felt would be detrimental to the citizens of Pijal's moon. However, Reckly was unwilling to hurt others in the process and was averse to violence. One of his colleagues described Reckly's past occupation as a performing artist to be innocuous. Despite the danger that came from being framed, the drummer opted to stay with the Opposition instead of turning himself in to Pijal's government.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nDespite having little experience with weaponry, Reckly wielded a [[blaster]] to defend himself during incursions with blackguards while on Pijal's moon.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nReckly appeared in ''[[Master & Apprentice]]'', a [[2019]] novel by [[Claudia Gray]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Master & Apprentice]]'' {{1st|[[Master & Apprentice (audiobook)|''Master & Apprentice'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Master & Apprentice (audiobook)|''Master & Apprentice'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Opposition members]]\n[[Category:Pijali]]"}}}]}}}}
