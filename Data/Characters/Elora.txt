She was the longtime [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] of the crippled former [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] and war hero [[Sunry]].\n\n==Biography==\nWhen Elora discovered the affair that [[Sunry]] had been having with the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Elassa Huros]], she convinced him to abandon it, and the two attempted to work things out. When Sunry was accused of murdering Elassa, she tried to contact anyone who could help, including Sunry's old friend [[Jolee Bindo]], who was traveling with [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] at the time. When the party arrived in [[Ahto City]], she asked Revan, whom she recognized as being a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], to become Sunry's [[Arbiter/Legends|arbiter]] in the hopes of proving the man innocent.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nElora only appears if the player has Jolee in the party or if they have met with [[Davin Kotras]] in a [[Spaceport/Legends|starport]] after landing on a [[Planet/Legends|planet]].\n\nElora is voiced by [[Carolyn Seymour]].{{Fact}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Elora\n|ru=\u042d\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]"}}}]}}}}
