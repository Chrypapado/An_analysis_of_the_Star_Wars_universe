During the [[Jedi Civil War]], the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombed]] Kni's homeworld. Kni survived the destruction of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] and fled and eventually took up residence at the [[Jedi Enclave]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer-Rim]] world of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. While there, he was approached by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who was suffering from [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesia]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Jedi Civil War]], the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombed]] Kni's homeworld, decimating the landmasses and boiling the [[Ocean/Legends|oceans]]. Kni fled when the Sith Fleet arrived, and narrowly survived the attack.becoming a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]]. He eventually found his way to the [[Farm/Legends|agricultural]] [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer-Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], where he found a secret [[Jedi Enclave]]. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] allowed him to take up residency at the Enclave, and he would often spend time in it's courtyard.\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIn [[3956 BBY]],<ref name= \"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> he was approached by an [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], and the two discussed the Kni's past. Kni recognized Revan as a Jedi, and thanked him and the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Council]] for granting him residence. Kni still lived at the Jedi Enclave as of its [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|decimation]] by the Sith.<ref name= \"KOTOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and Traits==\nKni was a [[Duros/Legends|Duros]], and therefore shared the same [[Color/Legends|red]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and blue skin of others of the species, albeit with a more teal tinge. He had a rather hunched posture. While living on Dantooine, he wore a white and mauve tunic, mauve pants, green and white [[Boot/Legends|boots]], and a [[Utility belt/Legends|utility belt]].\n\nKni was grateful to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] for allowing him the reside at the Enclave. He believed that the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] was losing the war, but to no fault of their own. Having seen the decimation of his planet, he believed the Sith to be strong enough to destroy all its enemies. He was capable of understanding [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], but spoke in [[Durese/Legends|Durese]]. Kni spoke with peculiar grammar, ending many statements as if they were questions, and appending \"yes\" to many of them. Due to his time spent fleeing, he had very few material possessions. <ref name= \"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKni appeared as a non-player character in the [[2003]]<ref name=\"KOTOR Date\">{{SW|url=news/kotor-galaxy-of-heroes|text=BioWare and Capital Games on Bringing ''KotOR'' Fan Favorites into ''Galaxy of Heroes''}}</ref> [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]].''
