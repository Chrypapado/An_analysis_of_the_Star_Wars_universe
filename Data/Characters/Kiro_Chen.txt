If we want to stop another Alderaan.|Kiro Chen to [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]|Rebel Force: Hostage}}\n'''Kiro Chen''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]], sending Chen, as well as thousands of [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] refugees to Alderaan's sister [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Delaya/Legends|Delaya]]. Chen then approached [[General/Legends|General]] [[Carlist Rieekan/Legends|Carlist Rieekan]] as a representative of a group of Alderaanian survivors willing to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. When [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] visited Delaya to help the refugees, Chen was introduced to her by Rieekan as someone who's been a great help to the Rebellion. What the rebel leaders did not know was that Chen was secretly a member of an Alderaanian faction that despised Organa for getting Alderaan involved in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|war]], and subsequently destroyed.\n\nChen was instrumental in abducting Organa before her meeting with the other representatives of various Alderaanian survivor groups that wanted to join the Rebel Alliance. [[Halle Dray]], Chen's lover and one of the leaders of the faction, contacted the Empire and planned to turn Organa over to them in exchange for a new planet the Alderaanians could settle on. However, the Imperials reneged on the deal and took Organa after killing her abductors. Chen was the only one who survived when Organa did not divulged his hiding place to her new captors. Later on he informed Organa's companions, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Ferus Olin]], that Delaya's [[Deputy Minister/Legends|Deputy Minister]] [[Var Lyonn]] was secretly collaborating with the Imperials and knew where Organa was taken. After her rescue, Organa forgave Chen and invited him to join the Rebel Alliance; an offer Chen declined. He explained that with the recent deaths of Dray and [[J'er Nahj]], the Alderaanian survivors on Delaya would need a leader to look up to and he planned on filling in that role.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chen, Kiro}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
