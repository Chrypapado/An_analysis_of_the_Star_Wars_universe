He had a dark-haired mustache and beard, weighed 150 kilos, was well muscled, and had considered a career in wrestling. However, he became a university [[Professor/Legends|professor]], getting a tenure with the [[University of Pangalactic Cultural Studies]].\n\n==Biography==\nArisster studied how literary cycles from different [[Planet/Legends|planets]] became merged as they entered the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] community. He specialized in the various myths of [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]]. In [[40 ABY]], he got an incurable form of cancer and only had six months to live. It was then that he saw a vision of Aayla (in reality a projection of [[Lumiya]]) telling him to enter himself in a mythical cycle by [[Death/Legends|killing]] a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].\n\nArisster took a number of people hostage at the [[Lorrd Academy for Aquatic Studies]], and demanded that the world's Jedi show up. When [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] refused to negotiate with him, Jacen having no other option detonated Arisster's [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] [[Bomb/Legends|bomb]], killing him and his Human shield, [[Serom Haxan]], to prevent Arisster from taunting the Jedi for their helplessness and killing other hostages with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] as the day went on.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Movac Arisster\n|es=Movac Arisster\n|pl=Movac Arisster\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arisster, Movac}}\n[[Category:Educators]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lorrdians]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
