He loaded cargo onto [[Starship/Legends|ships]] that arrived at the Czerka base on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. He had no strong political views, favoring neither the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] or the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]]. His reasoning behind this was no matter who ruled, they'd need somebody to load crates. In his free time, he could be seen playing [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] with the various travelers that visited Kashyyyk. He played pazaak with Revan during his search for the [[Star Map]] on Kashyyyk.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fodo Medoo\n|ru=\u0424\u043e\u0434\u043e \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0443\n|fi=Fodo Medoo\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Medoo, Fodo}}\n[[Category:Czerka employees]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
