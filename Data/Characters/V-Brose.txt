Three marks for lying.|V-Brose, punishing Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi|Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth}}\n'''V-Brose''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served as a [[Security Guide]] and guarded the [[Learning Circle]] school on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kegan]]. In [[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]], he encountered the [[Padawan/Legends|Jedi apprentices]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]]&mdash;who were searching for a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] girl named [[Olana Chion]]&mdash;while they were being punished by [[V-Tarz]], another Security Guide. V-Brose promptly stopped V-Tarz's punishment, but he refused to believe that the two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] were visitors to the planet as they claimed, gave them three marks toward a punishment, and had V-Tarz take the two Jedi apprentices to class.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|You heard V-Brose. Get moving.|V-Tarz, to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi|Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth}}\nV-Brose was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Security Guide]] serving on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kegan]] as a guard at the [[Learning Circle]] school, which taught [[The Learning]], a curriculum designed to keep [[Keganite]]s isolated from the outside [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] and dedicated to their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. While on a mission to Kegan<ref name=\"JA:TFfT\" /> in [[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]]<ref name=\"TERC\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> with [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]] to find a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] girl named [[Olana Chion]], [[Padawan/Legends|Jedi apprentices]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]] found themselves in trouble outside the Learning Circle school after talking back to a Security Guard named [[V-Tarz]]. As a result, V-Tarz threw the two Jedi apprentices to the ground and placed his [[Boot/Legends|boot]] on Kenobi's head.<ref name=\"JA:TFfT\" />\n\nHowever, V-Brose happened upon the altercation and demanded to know what had happened. V-Tarz explained that he had thrown the pair to the ground for resisting capture, though the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] claimed that they were not students but visitors to Kegan. In response, V-Brose explained to V-Tarz that physical force was not to be used on students, as The Learning was based on love, not fear. V-Tarz relented as instructed, which prompted the Jedi to again explain that they were not Keganites. Despite the protests of the two Jedi, V-Brose still believed that they were lying, informed them that no one visited Kegan, and gave them three marks toward a punishment before having V-Tarz take them to class.<ref name=\"JA:TFfT\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|No need to use physical force. We've discussed this before. The Learning works with love, not fear. Take them to class.|V-Brose, chastising V-Tarz|Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth}}\nV-Brose believed in The Learning curriculum, which taught Keganites misleading facts about other planets and [[Species/Legends|species]] in an effort to keep them loyal to their own planet and isolated from the rest of the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. While V-Brose punished students for going against The Learning, he also made sure that the punishments dealt by other Security Guides followed the curriculum's methods.<ref name=\"JA:TFfT\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nAs part of his Security Guide [[uniform]], V-Brose wore a [[Color/Legends|navy]]-colored [[chromasheath]] tunic.<ref name=\"JA:TFfT\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nV-Brose was created by [[Jude Watson]] for the novel ''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth]]'',<ref name=\"JA:TFfT\" /> which was released in [[August]] [[2000]] as a part of the ''[[Jedi Apprentice]]'' series.<ref name=\"TERC\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=V-Brose\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Keganites]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]"}}}]}}}}
