Riboga used to enjoy pitting his favorite waiter in combat in combat with various creatures. Due to this, Bez ended up with a nose that had been broken a number of times, hands which more resembled thick-knuckled paws, and several scars, including one that ran across his forehead. Bez held no hatred for the Hutt for this treatment, but he certainly was not sad when Riboga left. Bez continued to work on the barge after it was converted into the gambling establishment, [[Riboga's Barge]]. He worked as a dealer in the public section of the casino.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Waiters]]"}}}]}}}}
