Rask was a member of the [[Naddist]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]], which worshiped [[Death/Legends|dead]] [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Freedon Nadd]], who once ruled Onderon. After the [[Second Battle of Onderon|fall]] of Onderon's Naddist monarchy, Rask and his son, [[Nebo]], continued to preach pro-Naddist sermons in the streets of Iziz. On one day in [[3997 BBY]], Rask and Nebo were delivering their usual Naddist messages when they were accosted by an angry rock-wielding mob; however, they were saved by a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], who defended their right to free speech. Although Rask and Nebo were skeptical about Kun's assistance, Kun eventually admitted that he wanted to learn more about the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] and believed the father-and-son duo could help him. Kun enlisted Rask and Nebo to guide him to the [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], where they watched as Kun cut a hole in the side of the tomb with his [[Exar Kun's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. Declaring him a tomb desecrator, Rask and Nebo pulled [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] on the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] when he emerged from the tomb, but Kun swiftly killed them both.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Come with me.

Rask was a member of the [[Naddist]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]], which worshiped former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and deceased [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Freedon Nadd]], who ruled Onderon with the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] centuries before Rask's lifetime. Rask eventually had a son, [[Nebo]],<ref name=\"cswe\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> who joined him in preaching the Naddist rhetoric to the people of Onderon's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]]. However, their messages were very unpopular with the general public, who were happy that the Naddist monarchy [[Second Battle of Onderon|fell]] in [[3998 BBY]]. During their sermons, the father-and-son duo espoused the virtues of Naddist rule and denounced the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], whom they blamed for the downfall of the dark side-following Onderonian government.<ref name=\"darklords2\" /> Although Rask and his son's views were despised by their target audience, the Jedi refused to arrest them, as they had not technically committed any crimes.<ref name=\"audio\">[[Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith'' audio drama]]</ref>\n\nOn one day in [[3997 BBY]], Rask and Nebo took to the streets to deliver their usual Naddist sermon. The two preached from the base of a statue in an Iziz courtyard and attracted a large, angry mob of people who had grown tired of their propaganda. The crowd began hurling rocks and other projectiles at the duo. However, a lone Jedi Knight named [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], stepped out of the crowd and prevented the mob from continuing their attack, defending Rask and Nebo's right to free speech. Although the father and son were skeptical at a Jedi Knight interceding on their behalf, Kun clarified that he believed that the two Naddists could help him. Kun revealed his desire to learn the secrets of the dark side of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and after promising them [[Gold/Legends|gold]], he enlisted Rask and Nebo in guiding him to the [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd]]. The three flew a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] to the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]] where the tomb was located, finally reaching the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord's]] mausoleum. Kun proceeded to the tomb alone, assuring that Rask and Nebo would get a hefty reward if he found what he sought within. The two watched as Kun cut a hole in the side of the tomb with his [[Exar Kun's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], and when Kun returned, Rask and Nebo pulled [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] on the Jedi Knight. Calling Kun a tomb desecrator, the two Naddists demanded that he hand over the [[Sith scroll/Legends|Sith scrolls]] he had gathered while in the tomb; enraged, Kun [[Death/Legends|killed]] the father and son with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"darklords2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Freedon Nadd gave this city strength against the wild men and their beasts&ndash;as long as ''King Ommin'' and ''Queen Amanoa'' carried on their noble rule&hellip; the great power of Freedon Nadd remained with us!|Rask|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 2}}\nRask was very devoted to the Naddist cause, to the extent that he continued to ardently and vocally support the concept of a Naddist regime even after the fall of the dark side monarchy. He was a very bold public speaker, unafraid to talk about unpopular subjects in front of a crowd. Rask held an admiration for former Onderonian monarchs [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]] and [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Amanoa]], and praised Freedon Nadd for bringing the people of Iziz protection against the wild beasts of Onderon's wilderness. Both Rask and his son despised the Jedi Knights, and were accordingly surprised and skeptical when Exar Kun protected them from a rock-wielding mob. As Naddists, both Rask and Nebo held a measure of reverence toward Nadd's tomb and were quick to accost Kun with blasters when the Jedi Knight, in their [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], desecrated it.<ref name=\"darklords2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRask made his first appearance in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]'', a story arc of the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Kevin J.
