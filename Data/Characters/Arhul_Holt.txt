His defection spurred several equally high-ranked Rebel sympathizers to follow suit, resulting in a massive embarrassment to the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Fleet]] and the sidelining of [[Anaxes/Legends|Anaxes]] as a political player in [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] Empire, in favor of other worlds such as [[Carida/Legends|Carida]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Arhul Holt\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holt, Arhul}}\n[[Category:Anaxes residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy officers]]"}}}]}}}}
