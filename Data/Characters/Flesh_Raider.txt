Mass-[[Mutant|mutated]] and [[Reproduction/Legends|bred]] as lower-caste [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] in servitude to the Empire, some members of this species were abandoned on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] long before the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|resurgent Sith Empire]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], allowing the Flesh Raiders' survival past the collapse of the Rakatan Empire.\n\n==Biology and appearance==\nOriginally [[Mutant|mutated]] lower-caste members of the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] [[Species/Legends|species]], the [[Sentience/Legends|semi-sentient]] Flesh Raiders were extremely primitive and violent. Bulky bipedal [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoids]], Flesh Raiders had razor-sharp [[Tooth/Legends|teeth]], which they used to strip the [[Bone/Legends|bones]] of both sentient and non-sentient prey. Eight small olfactory slits lined their upper lip and two stumpy [[Eye/Legends|eye]] stalks protruded from the sides of their box-shaped heads.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nFrom what little study of the creatures the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] was able to perform, the Flesh Raiders of [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] appeared to have devolved into their primitive and [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] forms after the other colonists of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] disappeared. Another theory was that the aforementioned society was attacked by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] and subjected to bizarre [[Sith alchemy/Legends|experiments]] which reduced them to maddened hostiles.\n\nIt was also of some note that a few members of the Raiders species were observed as possessing sentient minds and [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]].<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Society and culture==\n{{Quote|Flesh Raiders are a species of hostile natives. They're smart enough to use tools and violent beyond reason.|[[Derrin Weller]]|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[File:Flesh_Raiders_camp_JMGD.jpg|thumb|left|230px|A Flesh Raiders camp]]\nHaving no established [[City/Legends|cities]] or formal [[Politics/Legends|government]], the [[Tythan]] Flesh Raiders were tribal and erected crude shelters on [[Tythos Ridge]]. There, they practiced a form of spiritual worship, as [[Shaman/Legends|shamans]] lurked throughout inside their small settlements, and idols made of rock were placed around their lairs. They also used signal [[Fire/Legends|fires]] to communicate over great distances and, preferring naked earth, the Flesh Raiders would scour the land they chose to occupy, burning away [[Grass/Legends|grass]] and [[Tree/Legends|trees]] and littering the earth with the bones of their prey. The Tythans were also scavengers, who would make use of almost any material found for [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]] or [[Armor/Legends|armoring]] themselves.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==History==\nAbandoned by the [[Infinite Empire]] following the [[Force Wars]] on Tython, the Flesh Raiders' origins was otherwise lost to [[Timeline of galactic history/Legends|history]], and the species themselves did not appear to keep any such records. Members of the Jedi Order around the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] speculated that the modern Tythan Raider was formed from a once civilized society that fell as other colonists of Tython disappeared, or that they were the result of individuals who fell victim to the onslaught of the Sith, and were subjected to their arcane [[Sith alchemy/Legends|alchemy]] which reduced them to their adverse state.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n[[Tythos Ridge]] was eventually conquered by Flesh Raiders as the Jedi Order relocated to Tython after the [[Great Galactic War]]. Under the barbaric Raiders, its ground was rendered an inhospitable ruin, filled with bones across the few paths that carved across the landscape. Thus dashed the plans were for a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Meditation/Legends|meditative]] retreat to be constructed there, as proposed by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Shol Bestros]].<ref name=\"TOR\" /> By [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"3643 BBY\">{{TOR_dates|1}} Since the [[The Barsen'thor|Jedi Consular]] Prologue mission \"Pilgrims\" refers to [[Sumari]] as the [[Kalikori village]]'s reigning [[Matriarch]] and Sumari [[Death/Legends|dies]] in the course of the [[Hero of Tython|Jedi Knight]] Prologue, during the mission \"The Face of the Enemy,\" the beginning of the [[Jedi Consular]] storyline must take place at some point by [[3643 BBY]]. As this article section assumes 100% game completion and that the player chooses only \"[[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]]\" options when available during the course of ''Star Wars: The Old Republic'', the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Consular must have encountered the Flesh Raider camps on Tythos Ridge during their [[Time/Legends|time]] on [[Tython/Legends|Tython]].</ref> the Raiders, now displaying greater cunning and proficient in arms such as the [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]], had built settlements at the Ridge and posed a deadly threat to outsiders as they occupied the path between the ruins of [[Kaleth]] to the west,<ref name=\"Tython directions\">''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]'' states that [[the Hollows]] was a valley north of [[Tythos Ridge]] and south of Kalikori village, in agreement with the assumption that ''Star Wars: The Old Republic''{{'s}} in-game map of Tython is shown where the direction of north is upwards.

It was then that a member of the Flesh Raider species, [[Fashk]], surfaced to the attention of [[The Barsen'thor|a]] future [[Jedi Consular]] and [[Barsen'thor]], who discovered the [[Gender/Legends|male's]] [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-sensitivity, as well as a likewise unprecedented case of sentience within a Flesh Raider individual.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:FleshRaider-TOR.jpg|thumb|right|280px|One of many concept arts for the Flesh Raider of ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'']]\nThe Flesh Raider was created for the [[2011]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi: Force War]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Strongholds]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught]]'' {{Vision}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Flesh Raiders}}\n*{{InsiderCite|114|Class Wars!}}\n*''[[The Art and Making of Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''\n*[[The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural (real-life book)|''The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural'']]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Nexus of Power]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fleischr\u00e4uber#legends\n|es=Cazador de Carne\n|ko=\ud50c\ub808\uc2dc \ub808\uc774\ub354\n|nl=Flesh Raider\n|ru=\u041f\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Deep Core species]]\n[[Category:Flesh Raiders| ]]\n[[Category:Sentient species]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
