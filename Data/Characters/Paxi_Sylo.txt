Therefore, this article assumes Sylo's year of [[Reproduction/Legends|birth]] to be between the years of [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]] and [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], nine years earlier depending on the [[Standard month/Legends|month]] he was born.</ref>\n|death=\n|species=[[Human/Legends|Human]]<ref name=\"DB\" />\n|gender=[[Gender/Legends|Male]]<ref name=\"DB\" />\n|height=\n|mass=\n|hair=[[Color/Legends|Brown]]<ref name=\"CW12\">{{CW|12}}</ref>\n|eyes=Black<ref name=\"CW12\" />\n|skin=Light tan<ref name=\"CW12\" />\n|cyber=\n|affiliation=[[Sylo family]]<ref name=\"DB\" />\n|masters=\n|apprentices=}}\n'''Paxi Sylo''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] born to [[Parent/Legends|parents]] [[Griggen Sylo|Griggen]] and [[Tashna Sylo]] on a [[Sylo farm|farm]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] between the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]] and [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]]. As a child, Sylo was an adventurous daydreamer, doodling stories of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] and the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], things he heard about in fragments of stories. In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Sylo witnessed the [[Battle of Dantooine (Clone Wars)|battle on Dantooine]] between the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] and the [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Separatist Droid Army]]. He watched in awe as [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] made short work of a massive [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Seismic tank/Legends|seismic tank]] that was crushing [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] forces. After the [[Tank (vehicle)/Legends|tank]] was destroyed, Sylo assisted Windu by offering him a drink of [[Water/Legends|water]]. Sylo went on to draw sketches of Windu defeating the seismic tank. During the reign of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], animations emerged of Windu's endeavors on Dantooine that matched the style of Sylo's doodles.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Battle-of-Dantooine.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sylo watches the battle on Dantooine.]]\nPaxi Sylo was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] to [[Parent/Legends|parents]] [[Griggen Sylo|Griggen]] and [[Tashna Sylo]] on a large outback [[Sylo farm|farm]]<ref name=\"DB\" /> on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]]<ref name=\"TEA32\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] between the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]] and [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]].<ref name=\"DB1\" /> He was the youngest of seven children, and his entire [[Sylo family|family]] harvested [[tritacale]] and [[yot bean]]s to supply a larder for [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] for the family and to sell off-world, as they had done for ten generations. During his childhood, Sylo enjoyed writing down adventures on his [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] and spare [[Flimsiplast/Legends|flimsiplast]]. He was told stories of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] and the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], a conflict between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the seceded [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], but Dantooine was so far away from the conflict that the stories might as well have been fiction.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\nSuch stories were made reality in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], when the Confederacy sought to take control of Dantooine to help ensure a victory in the coming [[Battle of Muunilinst/Legends|Battle of Muunilinst]]. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] led a force of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] from the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] to counter the [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Separatist Droid Army]].<ref name=\"DB\" /> As the [[Battle of Dantooine (Clone Wars)|battle]] ensued, young Sylo watched from the family [[Farm/Legends|farm]]. During the battle, the Separatists deployed a massive siege weapon called the [[Seismic tank/Legends|seismic tank]].<ref name=\"CW12\" /> Sylo watched in awe as Windu single-handedly destroyed the machine, ensuring victory for the Republic. Windu escaped the explosion from the seismic [[Tank (vehicle)/Legends|tank]] by jumping out of the machine, resulting in him landing next to young Sylo. The boy then shared some of his [[Water/Legends|water]] with the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], who returned to finish off the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] forces.<ref name=\"CW13\">{{CW|13}}</ref> For the next few [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]], Sylo could talk about nothing other than the battle he had witnessed, and he doodled several drawings of Windu defeating the seismic tank on his datapad.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\nBy the [[Time/Legends|time]] the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] rose, the Sylo family had abandoned their estate, but history lost track of the Sylos after that point. However, during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a bootleg [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] broadcast was made showing animations of Windu's activities during the battle on Dantooine. The [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]] unsuccessfully attempted to stamp it out, as it began to gain a cult status among would-be members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Though the animations were unattributed, the style very closely resembled that of Sylo's datapad doodles.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSylo was an adventurous child who was prone to daydreaming and had a very active imagination. He was fascinated by tales of Jedi Knights and the Clone Wars, and loved to write and illustrate stories related to those tales. He was very quiet, but that all changed after he met Mace Windu, as he could not stop talking about his encounter with the Jedi Master.<ref name=\"DB\" /> Sylo had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], black [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and light tan skin. He wore a [[Clothing/Legends|hat]] and sleeveless [[shirt]] with [[short]]s that were held up by a belt from which hung a canteen filled with water. He also wore a sort of band on his left wrist and walked around [[Foot/Legends|barefoot]].<ref name=\"CW12\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPaxi Sylo made his first and only appearances in the [[Clone Wars Chapter 12|twelfth]] and [[Clone Wars Chapter 13|thirteenth]] chapters of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''. The characters for the episodes were designed by [[Andy Suriano]], and both episodes aired in [[2004]].<ref name=\"CW12\" /><ref name=\"CW13\" /> Sylo later received an entry in the [[Databank (original)|original Databank]] on [[StarWars.com]], posted in 2004, which identified him by name for the first time.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{CW|12}} {{1st}}\n*{{CW|13}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{DB|character|paxisylo|Sylo, Paxi|archivedate=20110525000539}} {{1stID}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Paxi Sylo\n|fr=Paxi Sylo\n|nl=Paxi Sylo\n|pl=Paxi Sylo\n|ru=\u041f\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sylo, Paxi}}\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
