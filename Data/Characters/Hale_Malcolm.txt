However, when Malcolm, [[Zak Davies]], [[Dahl Harris]], and the farming settlers provided Master Vossan the coordinates of the Sand People's camp, the Jedi Master fell to [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Parkanas Tark|Vivicar's]] plague and went insane. This caused him to turn against Malcolm and the settlers as he sent the Tusken warriors to attack the farming settlement. Malcolm and his men were angry that Vossan betrayed them until they encountered another [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], known as the [[The Barsen'thor|Barsen'thor]]. Malcolm and the settlers were very aggressive toward the Knight, but the [[Jedi Consular]] convinced the farmers to provide Vossan's location.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malcolm, Hale}}\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
