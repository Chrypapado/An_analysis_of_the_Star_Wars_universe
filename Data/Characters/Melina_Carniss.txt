She was also a secret security officer at the palace. In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], she attempted to arrest [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], disguised as a dancer named Arica, when Jade tried to grab a blaster from one of the palace guards. Carniss thought Jade was part of an [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] attempt on Jabba by one of his rivals, [[Valarian/Legends|Lady Valarian]]. However, Jade was not trying to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Jabba, but instead [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], who was meeting with the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]].<ref name=\"SOF\" />\n\nCarniss took Jade into custody and led her out of the throne room to the dungeons. However, as she turned Jade over to the [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] guards, Jade used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to turn Carniss's [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] muzzle, causing her to shoot one of the Gamorreans. The guards turned on Carniss with their [[Force pike/Legends|force pikes]], giving Jade time to escape.<ref name=\"SOF\" />\n\nTwo years after the death of Jabba, she was recruited by [[Talon Karrde]], but she became a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] of [[Ysanne Isard]] during the [[Bacta War]] of [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]]. Carniss provided information regarding a smuggling shipment in the Alderaan system, leading to an [[Second ambush in the Graveyard|ambush]] by Captain [[Ait Convarion]]'s [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Corrupter/Legends|''Corrupter'']]. The attack was repulsed successfully by [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]]' group. Karrde discovered her treachery and wanted to eliminate her immediately. However, [[Booster Terrik]] managed, with difficulty and at great expense, to persuade Karrde to leave her alive long enough to use her to feed misinformation to Isard and ultimately set the stage for the [[Battle of Thyferra]]. She captained the [[YT-1210 light freighter/Legends|YT-1210]] freighter ''[[Empress' Diadem]]'' during the Bacta War.\n\nTwo years later, Karrde would encounter a woman named Celina Marniss (an anagram of Melina Carniss) who would, in fact, turn out to be Mara Jade. He hired her soon after he discovered this.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn [[Timothy Zahn]]'s 1995 short story, \"[[Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade]]\", he described the character of Melina Carniss as dark-haired, wearing a red jumpsuit, and crouching over the rancor pit after Oola was dropped in.<ref name=\"SOF\" /> This was later overridden, and the character in the red jumpsuit became [[Laudica]]. A Human female with black hair, wearing a white dress first appeared in the [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]] release of [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], but it is unconfirmed whether this character is Melina Carniss.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=A Time to Mourn, a Time to Dance: Oola's Tale|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace}} {{1st}}\n*''[[Mara Jade \u2013 By the Emperor's Hand 1]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Melina Carniss#legends\n|es=Melina Carniss\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carniss, Melina}}\n[[Category:Car'das members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jabba's dancers]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
