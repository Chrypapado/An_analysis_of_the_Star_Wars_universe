Treibeiu was stationed at the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy]] located on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]], and, in about [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], in the aftermath of an [[Raid on the Almas Sith fortress|incursion]] made by the [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] [[Phylus Mon]] into a [[Almas Sith fortress|Sith fortress]] situated on Almas, Treibeiu discovered the [[Dismemberment/Legends|dismembered]] corpses of three [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] whom Mon had [[Death/Legends|slain]]. Treibeiu subsequently helped to oversee a search effort to locate the missing Jedi [[Constanten (Tarasin)|Constanten]], [[Valiri]], and [[Vorlocca]], and she briefed a band of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] who had been assigned to look for the Jedi inside the [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Much of the evidence has been wiped out; the tent wasn't put up until after the attackers exited. But you will have a chance to search the area, and if you like, I can show you what I found when I arrived from my post&hellip; elsewhere.|Treibeiu, to the Heroes of Cularin|A Mon Alone}}\nTreibeiu was a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who served the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] during the latter [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Treibeiu attained the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], and, amid the strife of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], she was stationed at the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jedi academy|training facility]] situated on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]] in the [[Cularin system]].<ref name=\"AMA\" /> Circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"20 BBY\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is dated to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' [[Cularin's disappearance|moved]] the campaign forward ten years to the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]].</ref> the [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] [[Phylus Mon]] and a band of his affiliates made an [[Raid on the Almas Sith fortress|incursion]] into a [[Almas Sith fortress|Sith fortress]] located on Almas. Mon and his minions attacked and defeated a band of Jedi who were standing guard next to the [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]], and roughly two and a half [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] after the confrontation, Treibeiu ventured to the north entrance of the fortress and stumbled across the [[Dismemberment/Legends|dismembered]] bodies of the Jedi [[Tresten Agai'i]], [[K'kur]], and [[Milak Sonloam]], who had been [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the confrontation. Treibeiu and several other Jedi quickly put up a [[Tent/Legends|tent]] over the corpses, and they used the camp as a base from which to monitor the area surrounding the fortress while they investigated the raid on the citadel.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nThe Jedi [[Constanten (Tarasin)|Constanten]], [[Valiri]], and [[Vorlocca]] were reported absent in the aftermath of the attack, and the Almas Academy dispatched several rescue teams to look for the missing Jedi inside the fortress. Treibeiu remained on site next to the fortress to assist with coordinating the search effort. As she waited, a violent [[Sandstorm/Legends|sandstorm]] erupted. When the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a band of freelance agents who had been hired to assist with the investigation, landed in a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] near to the fortress entrance, Treibeiu approached the [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] and hammered on the [[Hull/Legends|hull]] until the agents let her in. She then introduced herself and informed them that she was there to escort them to the fortress. Using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to [[Telekinesis/Legends|clear a path]] through the sandstorm, Treibeiu led the agents to the tent next to the fortress entrance. When they arrived there, she used the Force to [[Mind trick/Legends|project an illusion]] to show the agents the dismembered bodies that she had found at the site to aid them with their mission. Treibeiu then answered several questions from the freelancers regarding their mission, and she provided them with a map of the portion of the fortress that they had been allocated to search. The agents subsequently entered the fortress.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nSeveral hours later, Treibeiu came back on watch to stand guard outside the fortress once more, and she received orders that the agents were to be retrieved and returned to the Almas Academy as soon as possible. The agents emerged from the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] citadel shortly thereafter, and Treibeiu arranged for them to be transported back to the Academy aboard a shuttle.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTreibeiu had a rough, hard-featured face and a high-pitched, pleasant-sounding voice that stood in contrast to her gritty physical appearance. She had a serious demeanor and resolutely served the Jedi Order. When dealing with others during her role as a Jedi, she was quick to get down to business.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|I'm going to create an illusion to guide us, so if you resist, you may not see it.|Treibeiu, to the Heroes of Cularin|A Mon Alone}}\nAs one of the most skilled illusionists based at the Almas Academy, Treibeiu possessed the ability to project images into the minds of others. She was also able to use the Force to temporarily hold back sandstorms.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTreibeiu made her first and only appearance in ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]] in ''[[A Mon Alone]]'', a [[2004]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|roleplaying adventure]] written by [[Morrie Mullins (person)|Morrie Mullins]] that forms part of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign.
