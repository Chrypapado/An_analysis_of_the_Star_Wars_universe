He would always appear gruff when interacting with customers; however, when ever he traded goods with the [[parent]]s of [[Norra Wexley]] and her sister [[Esmelle]], he would always slip the two children [[candy-swirl stick]]s. At some point prior to Wexley leaving Akiva to fight in the [[Galactic Civil War]], Bolo's store was burned down and rumor spread that the arsonist responsible was someone from the [[black market]] looking to make a profit by reducing the availability of certain items.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTorvo Bolo was first mentioned in the novel [[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']], which was written by [[Chuck Wendig]] and released in [[2015]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']] {{1stm|[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Torvo Bolo\n|ru=\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0432\u043e \u0411\u043e\u043b\u043e\n|ja=\u30c8\u30fc\u30f4\u30a9\u30fb\u30dc\u30ed\n|pl=Torvo Bolo\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bolo, Torvo}}\n[[Category:Akivans]]\n[[Category:Aqualish]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]"}}}]}}}}
