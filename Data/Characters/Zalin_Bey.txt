She got the popularity and thus increased from active duty to the future to take on various administrative tasks.\n\nIn [[23 BBY/Legends|23 BBY]], Zalin later commanded the Guard unit that Autem and his new partner, [[Isaru Omin]], were assigned to. Her unit was assigned the task of investigating the murder of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Jheramahd Greyshade]]. While Sagoro and Isaru went on the search for the bomber, Zalin investigated inside a laboratory where she searched for evidence. She soon discovered that [[Venco Autem]] was responsible for the murder.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Republic: Honor and Duty]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{DB|character|sagoroautem|Autem, Sagoro|archivedate=20100830071222}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zalin Bey\n|es=Zalin Bey\n|ru=\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0411\u0435\u0439\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bey, Zalin}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Senate Guards]]"}}}]}}}}
