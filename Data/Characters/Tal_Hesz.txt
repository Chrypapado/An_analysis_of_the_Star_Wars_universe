When Gillmunn brought a Rebel diplomatic envoy to the planet to meet with the resistance, Hesz was furious. When Hesz found out that a member of the team, one [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] was wanted by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] himself, he promised to exchange the rebel for an end to hostilities on Jabiim. When his plan backfired he was only able to provide Lord Vader with rebel mathematician [[Jorin Sol]]. This, along with Skywalker and the others' escape, angered Vader, who ordered the populace of the planet enslaved and an orbital bombardment, reducing the planet to rubble.\n\n[[File:Hesz_betrayal.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The betrayal.]]\n\nThis event devastated Hesz, who undertook a personal mission to find Sol and his people. After weeks of searching, an informant pointed him to [[Kalist VI/Legends|Kalist VI]]. After stealing an Imperial shuttle and disguising himself as a Stormtrooper, he headed for the planet. Hesz arrived just in time to see a Rebel fleet arrive to save his people and Jorin Sol. After the battle on the planet ended, Hesz was found out and taken into Imperial custody.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire: In the Shadows of Their Fathers]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Rebellion 0|''Rebellion'' 0]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tal Hesz\n|es=Tal Hesz\n|nl=Tal Hesz\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hesz, Tal}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jabiimi]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
