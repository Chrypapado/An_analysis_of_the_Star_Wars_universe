He referred to himself as [[Governor/Legends|governor]], and grew angry when not called by that title.\n\nKugg relied on his war [[Droid/Legends|droid]], the [[Destroyer (droid)|Destroyer]], to do his bidding whenever the planet's merchants did not pay his increasingly higher taxes. For pleasure and enjoyment, he watched tapes of the Destroyer's acts of destruction. When a young resident of Dodz, [[Jost Ellon]], stood up for his people with the aid of [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and an outdated [[Ranger X-1]] war droid, the Destroyer was eliminated in a battle with the Ranger X-1. The citizens of Dodz arrested Kugg so he could face trial for his actions, ending his reign.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKugg was created by [[David Manak]], [[John Romita]] and [[Carlos Garz\u00f3n]], but his species was not identified.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Droids (1986) 1|''Droids'' (1986) 1]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/the-droids-re-animated-part-1|text=The Droids Re-Animated, Part 1|int=The Droids Re-Animated}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Kugg\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dodz residents]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
