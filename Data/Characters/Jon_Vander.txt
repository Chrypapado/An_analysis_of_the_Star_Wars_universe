We're starting our attack run.|Jon Vander|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n'''Jon \"Dutch\" Vander''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] [[ace]] [[pilot]] from [[Onderon]] who first served in the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Imperial Navy]] before defecting to [[Massassi Group|the rebellion]]. By [[2 BBY]], he served as the [[Gold Leader|leader]] of [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]], a squadron made up of [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|BTL Y-wing]] [[Bomber|light bombers]], with the rank of [[captain]]. In this role, he was instrumental in [[Operation Handoff|escorting]] the fugitive [[Senator]] [[Mon Mothma]] safely to [[Dantooine]], where the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] would be formed. With the outbreak of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Vander fought with his squadron in the battles of [[Battle of Scarif|Scarif]], where his leadership contributed to the destruction of the [[Shield Gate]], and [[Battle of Yavin|Yavin]], by which time he had become a [[Ace|quadruple ace]]. Here, however, he would be [[Death|killed]] while attempting a [[Meridian trench|trench]] run on the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]], shot down by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nHailing [[Homeworld|from]] the [[planet]] [[Onderon]], Jon Vander was an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|pilot]] in the [[Imperial Navy]].<ref name=\"USW\" /> Onderon was a destabilized, war-torn world because of the militant [[Onderon insurgency|insurgency]] of [[Saw Gerrera]]'s [[Partisans]];<ref name=\"THO\">{{Rebels|The Honorable Ones}}</ref> however, when Vander was ordered to bomb pro-rebel areas on his homeworld, he refused, instead defecting to the rebellion against the Empire.<ref name=\"USW\" />\n\n===Serving the Rebellion===\n{{Quote|Phoenix Leader, this is Gold Squadron. We catch you at a bad time?|Captain Jon Vander to Hera Syndulla|Secret Cargo}}\n[[File:Jon_Vander_and_Hera.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Captain Vander salutes Captain Syndulla]]\nBy [[2 BBY]], Vander had joined the nascent rebellion, becoming the [[Gold Leader|flight leader]] of [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]],<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\">{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}</ref> a part of the [[Massassi Group]] rebel cell which flew [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|BTL-A4 Y-wing]] [[Bomber|light bombers]].<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref> They protected rebel convoys and attacked a few soft Imperial targets.<ref name=\"Rebels Recon\">{{SW|url=video/rebels-recon-inside-secret-cargo|text=Rebels Recon: Inside \"Secret Cargo\"}}</ref> At this time, [[Senator]] [[Mon Mothma]], who was secretly involved in the rebellion, delivered a fiery speech on the [[HoloNet]] denouncing [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] for his role in the [[Ghorman Massacre]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nAs a result, Mothma was branded a traitor and forced to flee her homeworld of [[Chandrila]]. As part of [[Operation Handoff]],<ref name=\"Rebel Files\">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref> Gold Squadron took on the duty of protecting the former Senator and escorting her ship, the ''[[Chandrila Mistress]]'',<ref name=\"Chandrila Mistress DB\">{{Databank|chandrila-mistress|Chandrila Mistress|archivedate=20170504122521}}</ref> to [[Dantooine]], where they planned to rendezvous with other rebel cells. En route, they met up with [[Spectres|elements]] of [[Phoenix Cell]] in the [[Lothal sector]] in order to refuel the Senator's transport. Vander and [[Gold Two (rebellion)|Gold Two]], as well as Mothma's aide [[Erskin Semaj]], docked with the ''[[Ghost]]'' and disembarked, meeting [[Phoenix Leader]] [[Hera Syndulla]] and her cell known as the Spectres.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nDespite butting heads with Spectres [[Ezra Bridger]], [[Garazeb Orrelios]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] over the sensitive nature of the mission, Vander allowed Ezra to fly a Y-wing after Gold Two was wounded during an Imperial attack. Vander and Gold Squadron used their [[ion cannon]]s to disable an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] before bombing it. Forming a defensive perimeter around the disabled ''Chandrila Mistress'', the Gold Squadron pilots bought time for Mothma and her crew to evacuate to the ''Ghost'', allowing the rebels to escape to [[hyperspace]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n[[File:Secret_Cargo_Star_Destroyers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vander, Bridger, and the ''Ghost'' escape]]\nCaptain Syndulla suggested an old [[Archeon pass|smuggler's route]] through the [[Archeon Nebula]] to escape the [[Lothal sector]] undetected. However, this tactic was deduced by [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], and he deployed two [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyers]] to the Nebula, as well as a [[flight]] of two [[TIE/IN interceptor]]s and an experimental [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter]] starfighter piloted by the ace pilot [[Commander]] [[Vult Skerris]]. Although the TIEs were able to shoot down [[Tyson (Gold Squadron)|Golds Three]], [[Gold Four (Archeon Nebula)|Four]], and [[Gold Five (Archeon Nebula)|Five]], Vander and Bridger (in the two surviving rebel starfighters) cooperated to disable Skerris through their mounted ion cannons.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nVander, concerned the seasoned TIE ace would return, exited the Nebula with Bridger, only to find the ''Ghost'' being drawn into the tractor beam of one of the Imperial Star Destroyers. At Hera's command, Vander and Ezra fired their [[proton torpedo]]es into the Archeon Nebula, igniting the gas and triggering an inferno that engulfed the two Star Destroyers \u2014 allowing the rebels to to safely jump to Dantooine. He provided a post-mission report to Dodonna.<ref name=\"Rebel Files\" /> Captain Vander, Gold Two and the other rebels were present when Mon Mothma gave an impassioned speech urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire. Shortly later, a [[Rebel Alliance Navy|rebel fleet]] emerged from hyperspace<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" /> and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] was formed.<ref name=\"Alliance DB\">{{Databank|rebel-alliance|Rebel Alliance|archivedate=20190401134341}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Battle of Scarif====\n{{Quote|Red Leader, this is Gold Leader: we're starting our attack run on the shield gate. Keep it tight and watch out for those towers.|Vander announcing a bombing run on the shield gate|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}\n[[File:Jon_Vander-Rogue_One.png|thumb|left|250px|Jon Vander during the Battle of Scarif.]]\nEventually, Vander and his squadron would be stationed at the Alliance's secret [[Great Temple|Base One]] on [[Yavin 4]], the fourth [[moon]] of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], he flew ''[[Gold One]]'', often with his astromech, [[R2-BHD]].<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\" /> Vander and Gold Squadron, along with [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue]], [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green]],<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\" /> and [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadrons]], departed from the Rebel base to accompany [[Admiral]] [[Raddus]] in his support of the [[Rogue One]] team in their attempt to [[Battle of Scarif|steal]] the [[Death Star plans|technical readouts]] of the planet-destroying [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]]. Assisting in the space battle as Raddus' fleet attacked the [[Shield Gate]] orbital station, Vander and Gold Squadron conducted several attack runs on the Shield Gate, utilizing [[proton bomb]]s in an effort to weaken the shield. After sustaining casualties, they were redirected by Raddus against the flotilla of Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"Rogue One\">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>\n\nVander gave the order to take advantage of an opening in Imperial defenses, and he and four of his wing mates swooped into position to attack. The Gold Squadron pilots launched [[ion torpedo]]es at the Star Destroyer ''[[Persecutor]]'', disabling it and allowing it to be rammed by a [[Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette|''Sphyrna''-class Hammerhead corvette]], the ''[[Lightmaker]]''. Colliding with the Star Destroyer ''[[Intimidator]]'' as well as the Shield Gate, this disabled the [[deflector shield]] and allowed the plans on the ground to be successfully transmitted from the [[Citadel Tower]] to the ''[[Profundity]]'', and eventually, the ''[[Tantive IV]]''.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> Vander survived the battle, and the actions of he and his squadron would prove beneficial in helping the Alliance to victory at Scarif, despite the high number of casualties.\n\n====Battle of Yavin====\n{{Quote|Loosen up!|Vander's last words before his death|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n[[File:Jon_vander.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jon Vander in his Y-wing as Gold Leader during the trench run]]\nUpon Vander's return to Yavin 4,<ref name=\"ANH\" /> he had reached the status of [[Ace|quadruple ace]], with twenty-two confirmed kills and 19,997 logged flight hours.<ref name=\"Grounded\">{{Shortstory|story=Grounded|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> After the plans for the Death Star were returned by the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', [[Alliance High Command]] was able to pinpoint [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso's]] weakness in the plans, a small [[thermal exhaust port]] leading directly to the [[Reactor|main reactor]], and decided that their best chance to exploit it would be through small starfighters, using proton torpedoes to target the shaft. Vander attended [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s pre-flight briefing as the Death Star approached to [[Superlaser|destroy]] the base. Visibly skeptical of their chances, he interrupted Dodonna by asking \"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are [[snub-fighter]]s going to be against ''that''?\" and then later gave [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia]] a look of concern when Dodonna mentioned that the exhaust port was only two [[meter]]s wide. Despite his reservations, he would again lead Gold Squadron's eight Y-wing force in the [[Battle of Yavin]].<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\n[[File:Gold_One.png|thumb|left|200px|Gold One exploding, killing Vander.]]\nDuring the battle, three of Gold Squadron's Y-wings separated from the main force, making up the first group that would fly into the Death Star's [[meridian trench]] in an attempt to knock out the exhaust port and destroy the station. Vander was on point, followed by [[Davish Krail|Davish \"Pops\" Krail]] ([[Gold Five]]) and fellow Onderonian [[Dex Tiree]] ([[Gold Two]]), who formed a buffer against enemy fighters. In the face of the station's [[turbolaser]] [[XX-9 heavy turbolaser battery|batteries]], Vander ordered his group to switch their deflector shields to double-front; however, this would have the adverse effect of leaving them vulnerable from behind. As Tiree was locking his [[targeting computer]], he was shot down by [[Darth]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Vader's]] [[TIE Advanced x1]]. This caused Vander to panic as he was unable to maneuver in the tight space; Krail tried to keep him calm but to no avail. A second later Vader fired into Vander's Y-wing. His Y-wing caught fire and eventually exploded, killing him instantly.<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Vander_helmet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jon Vander's flight helmet]]\nJon Vander was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] with [[Color|brown]] [[hair]], brown [[eye]]s, and light skin.

During a dangerous mission through the Archeon pass, Vander also became a mentor to the younger rebel pilot Ezra Bridger. Despite his earlier disagreement with the Spectres for their aggressive tactics and drawing the Empire's attention, he came to respect Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla for her valor and creativity.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nThough Jon Vander showed skepticism at times, most prevalent when questioning General Dodonna on the feasibility of the Death Star trench run, he also exhibited a calm and collected demeanor when he felt in control of the situation, as he did at Scarif and during the early stages of Yavin.<ref name=\"ANH\" /><ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> To squadronmates, he gave the impression of being stern and emotionless during tense combat situations.<ref name=\"Grounded\" /> He also demonstrated bravery in taking down a [[Star Destroyer]] and leading his squadron down the trench in face of heavy turbolaser fire. However, he also panicked when met with a rapidly intensifying and deteriorating situation, and this, as well as the tight formations he chose for his bombers at both Scarif and Yavin, proved to be his downfall.<ref name=\"ANH\" /><ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJon Vander was portrayed in [[1977]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] by Canadian actor [[Angus MacInnes]]; MacInnes later appeared as Vander in [[2016]]'s ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'' through a combination of archival footage and newly recorded lines.<ref name=\"Rogue One Return\">{{Youtube|Oy--g2NjP7M|Star Wars 'Gold Leader' Actor on his Rogue One Return!|channel/UCKhZplFZ1QaLqA_fCTVlU_g|Jamie Stangroom|archivedate=20201013215215}}</ref> Vander is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]] in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nThere is considerable ambiguity over Jon Vander's nickname.
