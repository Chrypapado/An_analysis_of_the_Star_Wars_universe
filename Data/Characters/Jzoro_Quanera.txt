Trins Evnar reported to Kazic Pendre, who, in turn, reported to a man named Jzoro Quanera. You need to report to Jzoro and convince him that you're ready to move up in the organization.|[[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vitala Baize|Baize]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Jzoro Quanera was a Chirq Council underboss who supervised all the criminal activities of the Chirq Council, mostly [[Spice/Legends|spice]] traffic, within and around the city of [[Doaba Guerfel/Legends|Doaba Guerfel]]. He was based in a [[Jzoro's Bunker|bunker]] near Doaba Guerfel. People under his orders included [[Kazic Pendre]], a businessman responsible for the Chirq Council cell in Doaba Guerfel.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCMU\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the [[Corellian Security Force]] started an investigation against the Chirq Council following the increase of [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] traffic on Corellia.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCSC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: Seek Council|Corellia}}</ref> [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vitala Baize]] decided to infiltrate the organization with a CorSec agent using the identity of [[Trins Evnar]], a Chirq Council member working for Kazic Pendre in Doaba Guerfel. An independent spacer who previously worked for the CorSec therefore killed Trins Evnar, as well as every other Chirq Council criminals who used to know him, including Kazic Pendre.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCAI\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: Assumed Identity|Corellia}}</ref> As Jzoro Quanera did not know personally Trins Evnar, the CorSec agent assumed Evnar's identity towards him and successfully managed to lure the underboss. The spacer pretended that Kazic Pendre suddenly disappeared and that was the reason why the spacer went to him. The CorSec agent thus joined Quanera's group and started to work for the underboss.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCMU\" />\n\n[[File:Jzoro_Bunker.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Jzoro's Bunker]].]]\nDuring that time, Jzoro Quanera was also trying to create a partnership between the Chirq Council and another criminal organization known as the [[Monumenters]] in order to increase his spice delivery capacities. For a first job, Quanera tasked the spacer to join a meeting between the Chirq Council and the Monumenters. The spacer headed to the meeting but killed the participants instead; and collected several crates of spice for the CorSec. The spacer later pretended that the Monumenters betrayed the Chirq Council and stole all the spice. As the spacer was the sole survivor of the meeting, Quanera was forced to believe that story. For a second mission, the underboss ordered to find and eliminate an informant who provided information to the CorSec about the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCMU\" /> The informant was [[Lilith Laughlin]], a woman who helped the spacer to infiltrate the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCSC\" /> The spacer instead killed another woman, [[Ebela Puckett]], a [[Grey Shroud terrorists|Grey Shroud terrorist]] and Captain Baize created evidences that the terrorist was working for CorSec. Once again, Jzoro Quanera was fooled and believed the agent. Having earn the trust of the underboss, the spacer was allowed to have full access to Jzoro Quanera's bunker, including its database. From Quanera's database, the CorSec obtained the identity of the nine [[Elite Council|elite councilors]] who ruled the Chirq Council and the locations of their secret headquarters.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCMU\" /> The CorSec eventually assaulted the [[First Elite Council Bunker|First]] and [[Second Elite Council Bunker]]s and killed all of the elite councilors. After their death, the Chirq Council quickly splintered.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCTEC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: The Elite Council|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jzoro_Quanera_(card).JPG|cardname=Jzoro Quanera}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Moving_Up_(card).JPG|cardname=Moving Up}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Chirq Council: Moving Up - Part One}}\n*{{SWGWiki|The Chirq Council: Moving Up - Part Two}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quanera, Jzoro}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Chirq Council]]"}}}]}}}}
