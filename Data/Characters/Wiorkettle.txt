He worked for [[Planet Dreams, Incorporated]], a company that [[Terraforming/Legends|terraformed]] [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroids]] and inhospitable planets and used them to create habitable [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmospheres]].\n\n==Biography==\nWiorkettle was Planet Dreams' chief artist, responsible for the aesthetics of the environments they created. He was an equal partner in the company along with the [[Lutrillian/Legends|Lutrillian]] [[Treva Horme]] and [[Ozz]] the [[Ugnaught/Legends|Ugnaught]]. In approximately [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], the partners relocated their head offices to [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]'s [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]].<ref name=\"GG3\" />\n\nThe three Planet Dreams executives were considering selling private hovering platforms in Bespin's [[Life Zone/Legends|Life Zone]] when Ozz revealed that someone was embezzling money and terraforming equipment from the company. Ozz vowed to investigate but was interrupted in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]] when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] arrived and [[Occupation of Bespin|took control]] of the city. The partners decided to download all of their files and evacuate, but while Horme and Wiorkettle followed the plan, Ozz disappeared. The remaining partners moved back to the [[Oseon asteroid belt]] after fleeing Bespin.<ref name=\"GG3\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Treva Horme and Wiorkettle TESB.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Treva Horme and Wiorkettle on Cloud City]]\nWiorkettle was a background character played by actor [[Cathy Munro]]<ref name=\"SW Interviews\">{{Cite web|url=https://starwarsinterviews.com/original-trilogy/episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back/cathy-munroe-zuckuss/|title=Cathy Munroe interview|work=Star Wars Interviews|archivedate=20210227184925}}</ref> in [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], but is likely unseen in the film.\n\nThe character was most prominently seen in behind the scenes images and promotional photos for the film, in every case paired with another background character, [[Treva Horme]].
