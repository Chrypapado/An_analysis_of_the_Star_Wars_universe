In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] [[Dissolution of the Imperial Senate/Legends|dissolved]] the Imperial Senate, handing control of the Imperial [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucracy]] to the regional Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governors]]. Atanna's responsibility for Esseles was taken over by [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Jander Graffe]], who set about replacing the bureaucracy that Atanna had built.<ref name=\"GNN3\" />\n\nAtanna and [[Gabrial Atanna's wife|his wife]] retired to a suburb in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Calamar]] on Esseles, where the former senator kept a low profile, avoiding attention from the Empire and local [[Politics/Legends|political]] parties. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], he worked as a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], secretly passing on information regarding defense industry programs on Esseles. While on an off-world business trip during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Atanna was compromised and arrested by the Empire.<ref name=\"ITCW\" />\n\n{{RPGseed}}\nAn Alliance extraction team was dispatched to rescue Atanna from Imperial [[Prison/Legends|incarceration]], while a second team headed to Esseles, where his wife and grandchildren were being held under house arrest at the former senator's [[Gabrial Atanna's estate|estate]]. The team successfully rescued the family, neutralizing around fifteen guards and several security devices to do so. [[Smuggler/Legends|Smuggling]] them off-world was harder, as Esseles Governor [[Griff Takel]] had ordered all [[Starship/Legends|starships]] leaving the planet to be thoroughly searched due to Moff Graffe's indication that he would be very displeased if Atanna's family escaped. However, the Alliance team was able to exfiltrate the planet and take Atanna's family to a secret rendezvous point, where they were to be transferred to an Alliance [[Safe world/Legends|safe world]].<ref name=\"ITCW\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGabrial Atanna was a competent senator, serving in the position as Esseles' representative for two governments. However, Atanna held no loyalty to the Empire and willingly served as a spy for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Atanna's service to the Alliance was valued, and when he was captured by Imperial authorities, the Alliance devoted resources to rescuing both him and his family.<ref name=\"ITCW\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGabrial Atanna was first mentioned in ''[[Galaxywide NewsNets]]'', which was published in [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 3|''Star Wars Adventure Journal'' 3]] by [[West End Games]] in [[1994]] and written by [[Paul Sudlow]]. Atanna was briefly referred to in an [[in-universe]] [[NewsNet]] article concerning the impact of [[Merchant/Legends|trade]] in the [[Darpa sector]], which contains Esseles, following the [[blockade of Ralltiir]]. Atanna's only other mention was in the article ''[[Into the Core Worlds]]'', again written by Sudlow and published in [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 7|''Star Wars Adventure Journal'' 7]] in [[1995]]. Atanna and his position as a spy for the Alliance are used as a springboard for a [[roleplaying game]] Adventure Idea revolving around an Alliance team rescuing Atanna's family from Imperial custody.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|3|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|7|Into the Core Worlds}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Gabrial Atanna\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Atanna, Gabrial}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Esselians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic senators]]\n[[Category:Imperial Senators]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
