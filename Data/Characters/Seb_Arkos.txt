He was of tall but lanky stature. Arkos was originally caught by [[Hal Horn]] and eventually sentenced to an unknown amount of years of hard labor in the [[Spice Mines of Kessel]]. On [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]], he joined a group around [[Booster Terrik]], who had also been caught by Horn and sent to Kessel two years earlier. Arkos eventually escaped from Kessel and tried to hide on [[Darkknell/Legends|Darkknell]], where he again offered his service of forgery. [[Moranda Savich]] tried to get new passports from him in order to vanish from Darkknell.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Interlude at Darkknell]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Seb Arkos\n|es=Seb Arkos\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arkos, Seb}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
