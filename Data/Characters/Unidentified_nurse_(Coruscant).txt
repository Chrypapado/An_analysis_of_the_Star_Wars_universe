She was present when [[Darth Malgus]], a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] who had taken part in the [[Sacking of Coruscant]]&mdash;a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] attack on the planet&mdash;arrived at the [[Medcenter/Legends|medcenter]] shortly after the battle in search of his [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] lover, [[Eleena Daru]], who was in the facility at the [[Time/Legends|time]]. After Malgus demanded to see her, the [[Nurse/Legends|nurse]] took him to find her.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I know the woman you mean. I can take you to her.|The nurse, to Darth Malgus|The Old Republic: Deceived}}\nIn [[3653 BBY]], the final [[Standard year/Legends|year]] of the [[Great Galactic War]],<ref name=\"TEA\">According to ''[[The Essential Atlas]]'', the end of the [[Great Galactic War]], which was in the same [[Standard year/Legends|year]] as the [[Sacking of Coruscant]], occurred in [[3653 BBY]].</ref> a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Nurse/Legends|nurse]] worked at a [[Unidentified Coruscant medical facility|medical facility]] on the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], which had fallen under control of the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] following the [[Sacking of Coruscant]], an assault in which the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] had captured the capital world. Shortly after the battle, a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] by the name of [[Darth Malgus]], who had participated in the Sith's attack on the [[Jedi Temple]] during the conflict, went to the [[Medcenter/Legends|medical facility]]. Malgus was looking for his lover, the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Eleena Daru]], who was in the hospital after being seriously injured during the assault on the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Temple. She had been denied treatment at Imperial hospitals because she was [[Alien/Legends|alien]], as the Imperials [[Speciesism|despised]] non-humans. Malgus demanded that he be taken to his lover, and the nurse volunteered to do so. While the nurse took Malgus to Daru, she told him that she did not realize at first that Daru was Imperial, but that she would have treated Daru even if she knew. When they found Daru, another nurse named [[Tal (nurse)|Tal]] refused to release the Twi'lek to Malgus. However, the female nurse convinced Tal to allow Malgus to take Daru, warning Tal that Malgus was a Sith.<ref name=\"Deceived\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA Human female, the nurse was a heavyset woman, and to [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Malgus, her [[Color/Legends|blue]] medical uniform looked like a tent on her stout frame. She had freckles and red [[Hair/Legends|hair]] that she pulled back in a tight bun. She was willing to take Malgus to his lover, and she was not afraid to stand up to the Sith [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] by telling him that the people of the medical facility were not savages as Malgus seemed to believe. She placed no restrictions on the species or affiliation of her patients, as in the case of Eleena Daru.<ref name=\"Deceived\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe nurse made her first appearance in [[Paul S.
