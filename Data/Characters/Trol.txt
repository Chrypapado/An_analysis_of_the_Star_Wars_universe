In [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]], he was one of the twenty-six [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] resistance fighters that served under [[Morgan Katarn]] at the [[G-Tap]]; armed with an [[SLM]] launcher, he and his companion [[Jen (Human)|Jen]] were part of the missile team.\n\n[[Vester]]'s [[Corellian light freighter]] approached and Morgan ordered the pair to destroy that assault ship. Jen loaded his tube and Trol attempted to get a lock, hidden behind some boulders. The SLM hit the underside of the ship but [[Vester]], its experienced pilot, returned it to its position. Trot felt anxiety while Jen loaded a second missile; once it was launched, the missile was hit by a laser, and the explosion killed the pair.\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama]]\n\n[[Category:Alliance Military enlisted personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sulonese]]"}}}]}}}}
