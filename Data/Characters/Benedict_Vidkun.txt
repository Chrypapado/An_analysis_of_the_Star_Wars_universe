Most of Vidkun's low salary was spent on expensive items by his [[Benedict Vidkun's wife|younger wife]]. His two brothers-in-law were [[Lair]] and [[Daiv]]. He was a contact of [[Dash Rendar/Legends|Dash Rendar]] who accompanied [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] to rescue [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] from Prince [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]]. They paid for the information and the plans for the sewers that lead to [[Xizor's Palace]] and hired him to open the grates and the zapping failsafe mechanism. For some reason they didn't trust Vidkun and did not allow him to call his wife before leaving, nor to hold a blaster in the sewers, fearing that he would give them in.\n\n[[File:BenedictVidkun.jpg|thumb|left|Vidkun in the sewers of Coruscant.]]\nHe led the band via the sewers until outside the Palace's recycling room. He left them a key and started to leave but Lando insisted that he would come along and wait for them. After a brief argument, Vidkun pulled off his hidden blaster and shot Dash whom he injured, but Dash shot him between the eyes immediately after.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nVidkun was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] with bulging brown eyes, a larger nose, a wispy beard and mustache, sharp yellow teeth, and often cleared his throat.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Rendar_shoots_Vidkun.jpg|thumb|Vidkun as appears in the SOTE trading card]]\nThe [[Shadows of the Empire (novel)|''Shadows of the Empire'' novel]], [[Shadows of the Empire (comics)|comic]] and [[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook|sourcebook]] describe and show Vidkun as a thin and short goblin-like figure. The [[The Topps Company, Inc.|Topps]] [[1996 Topps Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|''Shadows of the Empire'' trading cards]] by [[Greg Hildebrandt|Greg]] and [[Tim Hildebrandt]] depict Rendar shooting Vidkun. There, Vidkun is seen from the rear, however he obviously appears as a normal medium-statured and well-built man.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (novel)|''Shadows of the Empire'' novel]] {{1st}}\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (audiobook)|''Shadows of the Empire'' audiobook]]\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (junior novelization)|''Shadows of the Empire'' junior novelization]]\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (comics)|''Shadows of the Empire'' comic]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Secrets of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]''\n*{{SOTE|cardname=Same Beast, Different Sewer|link=https://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteTC0057.jpg|nobackup=1}}\n*{{SOTE|cardname=Dash Fires the Guide|link=https://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteTC058.jpg|archivedate=20130507123435}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Art of the Brothers Hildebrandt]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Benedict Vidkun\n|pt=Legends:Benedict Vidkun\n|ru=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0442 \u0412\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vidkun, Benedict}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
