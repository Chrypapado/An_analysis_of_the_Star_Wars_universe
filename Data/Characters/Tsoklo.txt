Tsoklo served as factory worker, but also worked for the [[Galactic Empire]] as an informant who reported to [[Supply Master]] [[Yogar Lyste]]. In exchange for protection, Tsoklo would report to Lyste on the activities of unproductive workers and law breakers. The Rodian also operated a [[fruit]] stall in the [[city]] of [[Kothal]], and at one point sold his supply of imported [[meiloorun fruit]] to Lyste.\n\nDuring the [[Empire Day]] holiday, the Imperials set out to find a Rodian named [[Tseebo]], an [[Imperial Information Office]] worker who deserted the Empire after stealing a large number of Imperial files. Tsoklo was apprehended twice by Imperials&mdash;first by a trio of [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]] and later by [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] of the [[Imperial Security Bureau]]&mdash;who compared Tsoklo to a picture of Tseebo to verify whether or not Tsoklo was the Rodian the Empire was after. On both cases the Imperials realized that Tsoklo was not their Rodian. Tsoklo later visited [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]] for a game of [[sabacc]], where he lost to the [[human]] [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] and the [[Lasat]] [[Garazeb Orrelios]].\n\nLater during the [[Siege of Lothal]], Tsoklo was imprisoned and enslaved on a [[Mining Guild]] [[ore crawler]] that was stripping the planet of its natural resources. Overseen by the [[Trandoshan]] [[foreman]] [[Proach]], Tsoklo and several others worked in the murky conditions of the crawler until they were saved by the [[Spectres]] rebel group when they hijacked the crawler in the name of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion]], after which Tsoklo himself pledged to fight the Empire.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rebel encounters===\n{{Dialogue|Garazeb Orrelios|How much for the whole crate?|Tsoklo|I'm sorry.

They inquired about the fruit's price, but Tsoklo informed them that the fruit had already been sold. Bridger suggested buying the fruit from the first buyer, but Tsoklo pointed out that the fruit was in the Empire's possession. He bid them luck anyways. After stealing a TIE fighter, the pair of rebels eventually stole one of the fruits from an ITT.<ref name=\"FF\" />\n\n===Empire Day===\n{{Quote|Enjoy the celebrations, citizen.|Agent Kallus reminds Tsoklo to have fun|Empire Day (episode)}}\n[[File:Tsoklo_and_Kallus.png|thumb|right|250px|Tsoklo encountered Agent Kallus during the Empire Day parade.]]\nDuring the celebrations of the Galactic Empire's [[Empire Day|fifteenth anniversary]], the Imperial forces were on full alert, searching for a Rodian named [[Tseebo]]. Tseebo was an [[Imperial Information Office]] worker who had deserted after downloading numerous Imperial files onto his [[AJ^6 cyborg construct]]. Sometime before the Empire Day parade, Tsoklo had gone to a Lothal outpost known as [[Jhothal]], and visited [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]], a [[Cantina|bar and eatery]] that was run by the [[Ithorian]] [[bartender]] [[Jho|Old Jho]]. Also visiting were Jarrus and the other rebels Tsoklo had encountered, who were looking for work and information on the heightened Imperial presence. Meanwhile, a trio of [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]] entered the establishment and promptly apprehended Tsoklo<ref name=\"ED\" /> while the Rodian was enjoying a cup of [[Lothal Spicebrew|spicebrew]].<ref name=\"EDWD\">''[[Ezra's Duel with Danger]]''</ref>\n\nOne pilot compared Tsoklo to a portrait of Tseebo, and once satisfied that Tsoklo was not their target, the pilots released the frightened Rodian before they harassed Old Jho, who had refused to air an Imperial broadcast in his cantina. Jho eventually complied, and one TIE pilot ordered Tsoklo and the other patrons to raise a toast to [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], while holding them at gunpoint. The broadcast, however, was almost immediately hacked by the supposed [[senator]]-in-exile [[Gall Trayvis]], who delivered a message of hope to other rebels. Tsoklo and the others watched the broadcast as the pilots angrily told Jho to turn it off.<ref name=\"ED\" />\n\nTsoklo later returned to Capital City to watch the Empire Day parade, which was showcasing a [[TIE Advanced v1|new kind of TIE fighter]]. While watching the parade, which consisted of various stormtrooper platoons and [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP]] walkers, Tsoklo was apprehended again by Imperials, this time the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] and several stormtroopers. Like the TIE pilots, Kallus compared Tsoklo to a picture of Tseebo. Kallus realized the Rodians were not the same, however, and reminded Tsoklo to enjoy the festivities. Although shaken, Tsoklo cheered when Wren and Orrelios launched [[fireworks]] into the nighttime sky, which appeared to be a part of the celebrations. Moments later, the rebels struck and destroyed the new TIE fighter, sending the citizens of Capital City scattering for cover.<ref name=\"ED\" />\n\n===A game of sabacc===\n{{Quote|Guess it's down to you and me.|Zeb Orrelios, to Lando Calrissian, after Tsoklo was eliminated from the table|Idiot's Array (episode)}}\nSometime later, Tsoklo returned to Old Jho's Pit Stop where he participated in a game of [[sabacc]], a kind of card game. The game's other two participants were Orrelios and the [[human]] [[smuggler]] [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]. As the game progressed, Calrissian ended up controlling the game, and Tsoklo found himself out of money to bet, forcing him to fold his last hand and leave the table in a fit of anger. Through the use of an [[Idiot's Array]] hand of cards, Calrissian ultimately won the card game.<ref name=\"IA\">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>\n\nTsoklo later witnessed Orrelios' comrades evade Imperial patrols on speeder bikes,<ref name=\"CtA\">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref> and witnessed Orrelios himself hijack an AT-DP walker alongside Bridger.<ref name=\"RR\">{{Rebels|Rebel Resolve}}</ref>\n\n===Siege of Lothal===\n====Enslaved by the Mining Guild====\n{{Quote|Slaves?|[[Jedi]] [[Kanan Jarrus]] upon finding Tsoklo and the other Mining Guild slaves|Crawler Commandeers}}\n[[File:Ore_Crawler_413-24.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Tsoklo was enslaved on Crawler 413-24, under the command of Captain Seevor.]]\nDue to the continued escapades of Orrelios and his rebel friends, the Empire eventually launched a full planetary [[blockade]] [[Siege of Lothal|of Lothal]]. The citizens were subjected to curfews, courtesy of [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]], and Tarkintown was burned to the ground. Tsoklo was walking the streets of Capitol City when the Rebels, who had previously left Lothal, [[Mission to Lothal (4 BBY)|returned to the planet]] when they attempted to rescue Tua, who decided to defect from the Empire. The rescue attempt failed, and the Rebels' speeder was shot down and landed in the streets, nearly crushing Tsoklo and several other citizens. Tsoklo, mouth agape, watched as the Rebels evacuated their damaged craft and ran into the city's alleys.<ref name=\"Siege\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>\n\nSometime later, Tsoklo visited the planet [[Nixus]], and was present at [[Nixus Hub 218]] when Bridger and the [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]] tried to conduct business with the [[Crime lord|kingpin]] [[Azmorigan]]. Tsoklo walked alongside and conversed with an [[Ugnaught]] while at the hub.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{Rebels|Brothers of the Broken Horn}}</ref>\n\nTsoklo later returned to Lothal<ref name=\"CC\" /> by the year [[1 BBY]],{{Fact}} right as the Empire tightened its grip on the planet. Alongside several others, Tsoklo was eventually imprisoned by the Empire, and was forced into [[slavery]] under the [[Mining Guild]], who was in charge of strip-mining Lothal of its resources. Tsoklo was assigned to [[ore crawler]] [[Crawler 413-24|413-24]] and placed under the command of [[Captain]] [[Seevor]] and his [[foreman]]<ref name=\"CC\" /> [[Proach]].<ref name=\"Proach\">{{Databank|guild-slave-master-proach|Guild Slave Master Proach|archivedate=20191010041326}}</ref>\n\n====Rebel salvation====\n{{Quote|You're all free now, but we could use your help to fight the Empire on Lothal.|Ezra Bridger, to Tsoklo and the other Mining Guild slaves|Crawler Commandeers}}\nWhile working on the crawler, fellow slave and former crime lord [[Cikatro Vizago]] told his co-slaves about how he was imprisoned for helping the rebel Spectres cell. Despite his imprisonment, Vizago believed that his rebel friends would come back for him. As it happened, the Spectres rebel cell and the local [[Lothal resistance group]] discovered the ore crawler in Lothal's southern hemisphere and quickly developed plans to hijack the vehicle, albeit while unaware of Vizago's presence on the crawler.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n[[File:Kanan_and_the_Slaves.png|thumb|right|250px|Tsoklo watches Kanan Jarrus fend off Proach.]]\n\nThe slaves were eventually found by Spectres member and [[Jedi Knight]] Kanan Jarrus after he infiltrated the crawler's boiler room. Initially believing Jarrus to be with the Mining Guild, Tsoklo and the other slaves took cover when Jarrus drew his [[blaster pistol]]. When Jarrus revealed his true intentions, the slaves cautiously revealed themselves to the Jedi. Vizago thanked Jarrus for what he believed was a rescue effort moments before he was attacked by Proach. Orrelios joined the skirmish, and the fight eventually led outside of the boiler room. Tsoklo and the others followed the battle and cheered when Orrelios defeated Proach after a heated [[Hand-to-hand combat|brawl]].<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\nHowever, an Imperial patrol intercepted the crawler, forcing Vizago and Orrelios to act as captain and foreman, respectively. In order to keep up appearances, Orrelios had Tsoklo and the others return to work. Eventually the patrol left, having believed Vizago to be the crawler captain, and Seevor was killed during an altercation with Ezra Bridger a little while later. Along with the other freed slaves, Tsoklo pledged his support of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], officially joining the fight against the Empire.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What are you looking at?

However, after his confrontation with Kallus, his mood was lifted after a series of fireworks lit up the Imperial parade on Empire Day, which also caused him to smile and applaud.<ref name=\"ED\" />\n[[File:Tsoklo_fails_it.png|thumb|left|200px|Tsoklo angrily leaves a game of sabacc]]\n\nAfter losing a game of Sabacc to Calrissian and Orrelios, Tsoklo was visibly distraught, and after throwing his cards onto the table, he stormed off.<ref name=\"IA\" /> When Bridger and Orrelios realized they would have to obtain a meiloorun fruit from the Empire, Tsoklo laughed at the possibility of them simply buying one of the fruits, but he wished them luck anyways.<ref name=\"FF\" />\n\nTsoklo was a braggart and a bully, and tended to harass others with the fact he had an Imperial friend. However, Tsoklo's relationship with Supply Master Lyste was merely a mean of protecting himself. If cornered by his Imperial allies, however, Tsoklo's belligerent nature would falter, giving in to cowardly throwing himself at his superior's mercy. He could also resort to a panicked flail.<ref name=\"HtH\" />\n\nTsoklo's fear also peaked while enslaved by the Mining Guild. Upon believing the Jedi Jarrus to be a Mining Guild agent, Tsoklo cowered behind equipment in Crawler 413-24's boiler room and armed himself with a tool. However, after witnessing the Rebel's heroic actions during the following hour, Tsoklo bravely pledged to fight against the Empire.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\nA Rodian with [[Color|green]]<ref name=\"ED\" /> pebble-textured<ref name=\"EDWD\" /> skin, Tsoklo had black [[eye]]s,<ref name=\"ED\" /> stood at 1.79 [[meter]]s, and weighed 72 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name=\"HtH\" /> Unlike some Rodians, Tsoklo did not exhibit spines on the top of his head.<ref name=\"ED\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nTsoklo kept a [[utility vibroblade]] for personal defense.<ref name=\"HtH\" /> Generally, Tsoklo wore a blue jacket, light pants, and brown boots during his daily activities, such as when he went to Garel,<ref name=\"DiD\" /> moved about Capital City,<ref name=\"SoR\" /> or operated his fruit stall in Kothal.<ref name=\"FF\" /> Tsoklo also had a house.<ref name=\"HtH\" />\n\nAfter being enslaved by the Mining Guild, Tsoklo was fitted with a vest in the guild's blue and yellow color scheme.

Lyste orders a surprise inspection of Tsoklo's home, discovers the grain, and then proceeds to arrest the Rodian.
