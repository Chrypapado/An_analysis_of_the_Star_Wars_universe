When Bria returned to [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] after escaping [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]], Pavik and Sera were disgusted by Bria's companion. With the arrival of the authorities investigating Solo&mdash;who had a [[Death mark/Legends|death mark]] on his head from [[Teroenza]]&mdash;Bria and her brother had a falling out and never met or spoke again.\n\nIt was Pavik who first suspected that Han was involved in illegal activity, especially after [[Dael Levare]] called Han by an alias upon first meeting the young man. Pavik then recognized Han from another scam of [[Garris Shrike]]'s, and contacted [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] against his father's, and Bria's, wishes.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Pavik Tharen\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tharen, Pavik}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
