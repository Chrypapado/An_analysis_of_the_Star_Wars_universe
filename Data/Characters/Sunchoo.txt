She was courageous, roaring defiantly into the face of one of Gama Bankor's IG-100 MagnaGuards, despite the possibility that she might be attacked. She was also willing to turn herself in to [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunters if needed in order to free fellow Wookiees from captivity. Sunchoo was loyal to Wookiee customs, making sure her life debt to the [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] and his friend was paid off properly, regardless of the danger associated with their mission. In addition, she knew the [[Tree/Legends|forests]] of Kashyyyk quite well and was able to navigate them successfully.<ref name=\"Jedi\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|You led us to Crovan.

Because the novel is a ''Decide Your Destiny'' book, there are several story strands in which Sunchoo appears, and the actions she takes in these strands are decided upon by the reader. This article assumes the strand in which she is featured most prominently, and any other possible ones are noted here.\n\n===Alternative outcomes===\n[[File:RryattTrailShadowlands-SWG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Shadowlands, where Sunchoo visits in one of several possible story strands]]\nWhile Sunchoo is being taken from Kashyyyk by Gama Bankor, Bant Eerin's Padawan and Jaylen Kos, while searching for Crovan Dane, come across [[Zaboshka|a Toydarian]] who has information on the elusive bounty hunter. At the same [[Time/Legends|time]], they notice Sunchoo being taken away by Bankor. The Jedi pair then has a choice to make: to confront Bankor about Sunchoo or stay with the [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]], who has threatened to leave if the Jedi don't pay him immediately for his information. If they decide to ignore Sunchoo and pay the Toydarian, he brings them to a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] to meet [[Goomi|a bounty hunter]] who is searching for Dane. If they decide to confront Bankor, he will eventually reluctantly release Sunchoo. Thankful for her rescue, she joins them on their mission.<ref name=\"Jedi\" />\n\nTogether, the three of them travel to Kashyyyk's [[Shadowlands/Legends|Shadowlands]], where Crovan Dane and his Wookiee partner, [[Tahnchukka]], are loading specimens of various [[Species/Legends|species]]&mdash;including a [[Terentatek/Legends|terentatek]] and a family of Wookiees&mdash;for shipment to the [[Trandosha/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Akoshissss]] on behalf of [[Muun/Legends|Muun]] [[Cyberneticist/Legends|cyberneticist]] [[Bitt Panith]]. However, Tahnchukka smells Sunchoo and begins to seek her out. Realizing this, Sunchoo offers to turn herself in to Tahnchukka, giving the Jedi time to release the captives and arrest Dane. The reader then has to make a decision as to whether to remain hidden and let Sunchoo make a distraction, or to directly confront Dane and Tahnchukka. If the reader decides to not let Sunchoo turn herself in, the Jedi will be discovered. The two Jedi try to disarm the bounty hunter duo using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], but the terentatek's power of repelling the Force makes this attempt fail. The Jedi, not wanting to engage the two bounty hunters without the Force, run, but Dane [[Stun/Legends|stuns]] them. Sunchoo and the two Jedi later come to an arena, on the cusp of being executed.<ref name=\"Jedi\" />\n\nIf the reader chooses to listen to Sunchoo and let her turn herself in, she will be brought by Dane and Tahnchukka to their [[Starship/Legends|ship]], giving the [[Youngling/Legends|youngling]] and the Padawan time to release the captives. However, the bounty hunters return and begin to fire upon the two Jedi, and Dane is eaten whole by the released terentatek. While Tahnchukka tries to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the dangerous animal, the Jedi go to Dane's ship and release Sunchoo along with the other Wookiee prisoners. Sunchoo and the Wookiee family then bring the Jedi back to their village, where both Jedi and Wookiees celebrate their success. After the party, the two Jedi leave Kashyyyk, though Sunchoo promises to give them aid whenever they call for it. Considering her life debt to be repaid, Bant Eerin's Padawan plans to return to Kashyyyk after the Clone Wars to introduce Sunchoo to his friend and fellow Padawan, [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]].<ref name=\"Jedi\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Clone Wars: Decide Your Destiny: The Way of the Jedi]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sunchoo\n|pl=Sunchoo\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
