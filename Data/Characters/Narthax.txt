The scene involved him and his snowtrooper group being tricked into entering a [[Wampa/Legends|wampa]] pen during the Imperial attack on Echo Base, provoking the wampas within; [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] of the Rebel Alliance had ripped off the warning label on the pen's entrance while evacuating the base.<ref name=\"Deleted scene\">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]''</ref> The scenes surrounding the snowtroopers' initial entrance into Echo Base were filmed in [[Wikipedia:England|England's]] [[Elstree Studios]] between [[March]] and [[April]] [[1979]].<ref name=\"The Making of The Empire Strikes Back\">''[[The Making of The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Wampa_pen_top.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Sergeant Narthax (leftmost) was one of the snowtroopers filmed for the ''The Empire Strikes Back'' deleted scene outside the wampa pen.]]\nIn [[1996]], the scene with Narthax was used as the basis for \"[[One Step Ahead]],\" a short story in the [[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back (Second Edition)|second edition]] of ''[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Although \"One Step Ahead\" canonizes the event of wampas attacking snowtroopers,<ref name=\"GG3\">{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back (Second Edition)|text=''Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back'', Second Edition|story=One Step Ahead|stext=One Step Ahead}}</ref> no link was ever officially made between production photos of the deleted scene and the short story. Therefore, this article avoids making any [[in-universe]] links between Narthax and any of the snowtroopers from \"One Step Ahead.\"\n\nIn fall [[1998]], the deleted scene was described, along with photos showing Narthax and his squad, in the [[Wikipedia:CD-ROM|CD-ROM]] ''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''.
