While she was working in the ship, a [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] [[Vigo/Legends|vigo]] named [[Slak Sagar]], along with several Black Sun thugs, hijacked the research vessel and imprisoned the scientists, including the agricultural researcher. Slak, under the command of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] master [[Zarien Kheev]], began to experiment on the captured researchers using an experimental organic drug meant to increase the work performance of the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] slaves mining [[Mirkanite/Legends|mirkanite]] on [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]].\n\nWhen the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] discovered that the research vessel had been hijacked by the vigo, [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] hired a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]], [[Rianna Saren]], along with her [[Security droid/Legends|security droid]], [[Z-58-0|Zeeo]], to find out what exactly was going on. After arriving at the agricultural research vessel, the pair were able to battle their way in and [[Slicer/Legends|slice]] into a [[dataport]], and found out about the tests Slak was carrying out on his prisoners. Rianna planted some charges on the ship to destroy it and stop the production of the drugs, and while she was leaving the ship, Slak interrogated the female agricultural researcher about the rebel intruder. When she said that she didn't know anything about the mercenary, Slak shot her with his [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], killing her. He then told his men to kill the rest of the prisoners and to abandon the research vessel. Slak, along with many of his men, were however killed by Rianna while on her way out of the ship. Rianna would find out about the Wookiee slaves on Mustafar from Slak and would [[Mission to Mustafar (Rianna Saren)|continue]] on to Mustafar to stop the mirkanite mining.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Lethal Alliance]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Unidentified females]]"}}}]}}}}
