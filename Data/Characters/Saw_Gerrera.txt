And I won't apologize for how I do it.|Saw Gerrera|Ghosts of Geonosis}}\n'''Saw Gerrera''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Onderonian]] resistance fighter who, as a leading member of the [[Onderon rebels]], fought against the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] on [[Onderon]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He and his younger sister, [[Steela Gerrera]], were instrumental in the rebel liberation of their [[homeworld]] during the [[Onderonian Civil War]]. He later became a key member in the fight against the [[Galactic Empire]] and the formation of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. His tactics against the Empire led him to be seen as an extremist, one whose notoriety was recognized by the Empire and, many [[Standard year|years]] later, the [[New Republic]].\n\nIn the early resistance against the Separatist Alliance on Onderon, Gerrera and his fellow [[soldier]]s were outnumbered and out-fought by the [[Separatist Droid Army]]. They requested help from the [[Jedi High Council]], which led the [[Grand Army of the Republic|Grand Army]] of the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] in its fight against the Separatists, but the [[Jedi Order]] chose not to become actively involved in the fighting on Onderon. Instead, they sent a team of [[advisor]]s&mdash;[[Jedi General|Generals]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Commander]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], and [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex|CT-7567]] \"Rex\"&mdash;to train the Onderonian fighters. The [[Jedi]] and [[Captain]] Rex taught them proper techniques and strategies for taking on the [[battle droid]] army, and, through their efforts, the rebels began to turn the tide. Gerrera came to resent that the rebels chose Steela as their leader, and he was soon captured in an ill-concocted solo effort to rescue the deposed [[King]] [[Ramsis Dendup]] from the Separatists. They were both rescued by the rebels, who eventually mounted a final battle against the Separatists. Through their efforts, the rebels liberated their world and returned Dendup to the throne. The fight, however, came at a personal cost: Steela was killed during the final battle, and Gerrera was left to mourn his sister&mdash;feeling responsible for her death.\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] into the Galactic Empire. Later, Saw brought [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]], [[Lyra Erso]], and [[Jyn Erso]] to the uninhabited planet of [[Lah'mu]]. When [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]] took Jyn's parents away from her, Saw found her and raised her until she was a young adult. Gerrera claimed Jyn as his own daughter. Gerrera fought against the [[Imperial Military]] and led a resistance group known as the [[Partisans]], a militant organization that some considered an extremist organization with [[Terrorist|terrorism]] tactics, and operated under the codename, \"'''Stoneface'''.\" His resistance cell, a continuation of his Onderonian resistance, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was later involved in the early campaigns of the Rebel Alliance, by which [[time]] his more-extreme tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and [[Mon Mothma]]. He eventually based his group on [[Jedha]], where he met Jyn again. When [[Jedha City]] was destroyed by the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], Saw told Jyn he was done running and stayed on Jedha, and was killed by the aftermath of the blast.\n\nDuring the time of the New Republic, [[Senator]] [[Ransolm Casterfo]] suggested that Gerrera and his Partisans, though part of the Rebel Alliance, [[Campaigns of Saw Gerrera's Partisans|engaged]] in terrorist tactics.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\n{{Quote|We're looking forward to taking the fight to those scrappin' droids.|Saw Gerrera, to Anakin Skywalker|A War on Two Fronts}}\n[[File:Onderonian_humans.png|thumb|left|210px|Saw and Steela handle their signature weapons&mdash;Saw's RPS-6 rocket launcher and Steela's [[Sniper rifle|sniper blaster rifle]].]]\nSaw Gerrera was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[jungle]] [[planet]] [[Onderon]] during the last [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"Ultimate\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> Growing up within the walls of Onderon's [[capital]] [[city]] of [[Iziz]] as an [[Onderonian]] with his sister [[Steela Gerrera]], Saw learned to greatly respect Onderon's [[Monarchy|monarch]], longtime [[King]] [[Ramsis Dendup]].<ref name=\"The Soft War Episode Guide\" /> In [[24 BBY]],<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\" /> thousands of [[star system]]s [[Separatist Crisis|seceded]] from the Republic and formed their own [[The galaxy|galactic]] government, the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]].

Having obtained enough [[armor]], [[blaster]]s, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle [[droid]] forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid. As a result, the esteemed [[Jedi High Council]] on the Republic's capital world, [[Coruscant]], heard Saw and Bonteri's story via [[HoloNet]] transmission. Diminutive [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] promised that the [[Jedi Order]] would find a way to aid them.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" /> A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in the jungle [[Sector S-11]] and Steela led a [[squad]] to investigate. Shortly, Steela, mounted on a [[dalgo]] steed, returned with Yoda's promise: [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], his [[Togruta]] [[Padawan]] learner, [[Ahsoka Tano]], [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and [[501st Legion]] [[Cloning|clone]] [[trooper]] [[Rex|CT-7567]], nicknamed \"Rex.\" Saw, mounted on his [[reptavian]] [[ruping]], welcomed the four [[Republic Military]] advisors to his world. Skywalker informed Saw that they couldn't fight the [[Onderonian Civil War]] for the resistance&mdash;Onderon, after all, was legitimately aligned with the Confederacy, no matter how illegitimate Saw viewed the situation&mdash;but he would train Saw's resistance to fight well on their own.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\n[[File:OnderonianRebellion-WOTF.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Republic advisors train Saw and his resistance at the secret encampment.]]\nRex explained that as a clone trooper, he would assist the [[Jedi General]]s, and after relocating a half-[[kilometer]] to a clearing in the jungle where a captured Separatist [[Armored Assault Tank Mk I|Armored Assault Tank]] was left dormant, [[Jedi Commander]] Tano and [[Clone Captain]] Rex instructed the freedom fighters on how to disable the [[Tank (vehicle)|tank]]: they had drop a pair of [[Electro Magnetic Pulse grenade]]s&mdash;\"droid poppers\"&mdash;into both the tank's [[cockpit]]s, one for the [[pilot]] and one for the [[gunner]]. Saw and Bonteri teamed for the exercise, but sharing in a tense rivalry, incidentally [[Saboteur|sabotaged]] one another by refusing to cooperate. Disgusted, Saw ridiculed Bonteri for being a \"terrible [[soldier]],\" which disappointed the [[Jedi]] [[advisor]]s. As the [[Standard day|day]] wore on, Saw grew increasingly frustrated, berating Steela for regularly attending to Bonteri, with whom she shared a mutual attraction. As the confrontation between Saw and Bonteri almost came to blows, Steela diffused the two men, explaining that there would be both a time for the direct fight that Saw desired, and the [[Politics|political]] speeches that Bonteri excelled at.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\nThe rebels next returned to the encampment, where [[General]] Skywalker and Rex demonstrated how to most efficiently disable [[droideka]] [[security droid]]s. Protected by a [[Deflector shield generator|deflector shield]], droidekas were immune to blaster [[Laser|bolts]]. Skywalker, thus, indicated that a slowly rolled droid popper was the best way to disable the droids. Confident in his abilities, Saw stepped up and attempted the technique first; however, he rolled the [[grenade]] too quickly and failed to penetrate the shield. Bonteri tried next and succeeded. Later, after many tries and much coaching from Tano, Saw managed to roll the grenade at the right speed and pierce the shield.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\n[[File:Epguide502.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saw rushed to the battlefront at the first sign that their base was under attack.]]\nShortly thereafter, the Jedi advisors moved on to coaching the rebels on how to properly utilize their [[blaster rifle]]s. Steela, a [[sniper]], impressed the Jedi with her skill. But while practicing, she was alerted to the fact that their encampment was under attack. Separatist [[B1-series battle droid]]s and an Assault Tank pushed through the brush and opened fire on the rebels. Saw narrowly avoided being taken out by a [[missile]] blast from a [[B2-HA super battle droid]], and advanced onto the frontline of the skirmish and returned fire. At a signal from the Jedi and Steela, Saw and other rebels heaved [[Onderonian disruptor|disruptor]] explosives into the path of the droids. Still outgunned, Steela loosed the dalgos, [[falumpaset]]s, and [[tee-muss]] [[mammal]]s, which stampeded and trampled the remaining droids. With only the armored tank remaining, Saw and Bonteri tried once more to disable the tank. On this attempt, however, the rebels worked together and succeeded in destroying the tank with a pair of [[thermal detonator]]s. Elated in their first victory, Saw quipped that Bonteri looked more like a soldier than a politician, due to the grit that had come to cover him during the altercation. Knowing that their base location was compromised, the rebels and their advisors concocted a plan to infiltrate Iziz and pose as civilians in the hopes that they could wage the guerrilla war from within the capital.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\n====Taking the fight to the Confederacy====\n{{Quote|The people were fearful, Master.''\"<br>\"''Indeed.

Why are they afraid?|Tano, Kenobi, and Saw examine the public perception of the rebels|Front Runners}}\nLater in the day, posing as [[Hunting|hunters]], the rebels and military advisors boarded a pair of dalgo-yoked Mandolorian transports and traveled to Iziz and fooled the \"dim-witted\" [[OOM command battle droid]] checkpoint in order to gain pass through the city's [[ray shield]]ed main gate. The rebels then split up; Saw alerted other rebels already within the city that the time to fight had come, while Steela, Bonteri, Tano, and others went in search of new recruits.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\n[[File:Saw_reckless_in_Iziz_Onderon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Saw fires on Separatist droids near Iziz civilians, which caused the civilians to fear Saw and the rebels.]]\nAs time went on, many more Onderonians enlisted with the independence fighters and they took shelter in a [[Onderon rebel safe house|safe house]] deep in the city. Holding Iziz under siege from within, Saw, Bonteri, and Steela received regular intelligence and guidance from not only Skywalker, Kenobi, Tano, and Rex, but the Jedi Masters on Coruscant as well. Saw and the rebels took as many chances as they could to disrupt battle droid patrols and destroy droids harassing Iziz civilians, engaging in as many as five engagements in a single day&mdash;sometimes, even in high-traffic areas, such as [[Malgan Market]]. Saw often opened fire on Separatist minions publicly, which caused fear to mount in the civilian population, despite the fact that civilian casualties sat at zero.<ref name=\"Front Runners Episode Guide\">{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/front-runners|text=\"Front Runners\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}</ref>\n\nOne day, Saw and his resistance held a meeting in their Iziz safehouse, where Skywalker congratulated them on waging a thus-far successful campaign. Kenobi and Tano, however, believed that the public perception of Saw's rebels had not gone as planned; the people were growing ever more fearful of the sudden violence that had besieged their city. Saw, however, believed that the people were fearful simply because the droids were still active&mdash;that he hadn't done enough to demobilize the Confederates. Steela and Bonteri added that they had to assure the general populace that the freedom fighters were just that: fighting for the freedom of the people. Steela believed the rebels had to win the [[heart]]s and minds of the people to gain their trust, something Saw did not understand. In order to prove to the civilians that the rebels could oust the Separatists, Bonteri proposed that they strike the [[Onderon power generator]]. In agreement, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex returned to the [[Core Worlds]], having outfitted the rebels as planned.<ref name=\"Front Runners\" />\n\n[[File:Lux_and_Saw_plan_their_attack_Iziz.jpg|thumb|250px|The resistance leaders devise a strategy to siege the Iziz power generators.]]\nThe Jedi Knights pledged that they would continue to provide [[credit]]s to the Saw's movement and also stationed Tano to remain on Onderon. At dusk, Saw, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela [[scout]]ed out the power generator complex. Lying prone on a rooftop, Bonteri explained that if they could manage to disable the power compound it would cause a city-wide power outage, which, given time, would bring the Droid Army to a literal standstill: the droids operated independently of a control [[computer]], but still had to recharge periodically using [[power cell]]s.<ref name=\"Front Runners Episode Guide\" /> However, before assaulting the generators, the rebels concluded that they needed to know more about the compound. Saw took it upon himself to gather the desired intel: he quickly descended the building and brutishly ripped the head off of a patrolling \"clanker\" in the street and returned to the rooftop where a [[robolobotomy]] was performed using a Republic-provided[[robolobotomy device| device]]. From the [[Hologram|holographic]] images provided from the [[Droid brain|cranial unit]], Saw and the rebels came to the conclusion that any attack on the compound would be futile; the droids were too numerous. Bonteri, however, saw an opportunity and added that if they had enough firepower it could be done with a [[Thief|hijacked]] Separatist Assault Tank <ref name=\"Front Runners\" /> .\n\nIn order to secure the tank, the resistance concocted a ruse: on a nearby street, the rebel [[Dono (Onderonian)|Dono]] detonated an EMP-loaded [[airspeeder]] in the path of droid [[Patrol 118]], beginning the attack. Saw, utilizing droid poppers and a [[DC-15A blaster carbine]], took down the entire patrol, with the exception of the [[commander]] droid. The rebels let the commander call for reinforcements, hoping that the Separatists would deliver aid in the form of an Assault Tank. First, however, a pair of droidekas were sent in. Outmatched from the front, Saw and Bonteri navigated behind the droidekas in a flanking maneuver.<ref name=\"Front Runners Episode Guide\" />\n\n[[File:Saw_dodges_battle_droids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Saw dodges enemy small arms fire during combat in the streets of Iziz.]]\nTrue to his training, Saw rolled his EMP grenade into the droideka's bubble shield and successfully disabled it, but Bonteri's grenade went too fast and alerted the other droideka to the danger behind. The droid turned and fired at its adversaries, but Saw acted quickly, shoving Bonteri to safety. Saw dove behind the disabled droideka, but was pinned down, so Steela leaped into action and deposited a droid popper gently into the droideka's shield bubble, disabling it. Just then, the desired Assault Tank rumbled onto the street and fired on the rebels. Saw and Bonteri rapidly closed the distance between them and the tank, taking down its [[B2-series super battle droid]] escorts on the way, and disabled the [[repulsorcraft]] using the duel droid popper strategy, just as they were trained. Saw then boarded the tank and attempted to get it running again, but to no avail. Steela, however, having a self-described \"woman's touch,\" and being the better pilot of the two of them, managed to start it up once more.<ref name=\"Front Runners\" />\n\nSaw piloted the tank to the entrance to the generator compound and blew in the compound's two metal gateways. Steela sniped the droid guards while Saw waited for the tank's [[laser cannon]] to recharge. Bonteri and Steela fought off several [[BX-series droid commando]]s before Saw was able to target the generator itself, and when he fired on it, the ensuing explosion plunged the entire city into darkness. Saw donned [[Night goggles|night vision goggles]] in order to see, and was pleased to see that the freedom fighters were being cheered on by the Iziz citizens. Saw, Steela, Tano, and Bonteri returned to the safehouse and celebrated, raising [[Alcohol|drinks]] for Onderon. Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex appeared via the HoloNet and a [[holoprojector]] and congratulated the resistance troopers. Kenobi added, however, that the time had come for the movement to elect an official leader. Confident that he would be elected by popular vote, Saw was disheartened when instead Steela was chosen by the Onderonian soldiers. Saw angrily stormed off.<ref name=\"Front Runners\" />\n\n[[File:Saw_spots_the_droid_convoy_in_Iziz.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saw calls out the location of the Confederate convoy to Steela and her squad of rebels while wearing a hood.]]\nKing Rash and his Separatist forces had truly begun to feel the pressure from the rebel raids throughout Iziz, so Dooku <ref name=\"The Soft War\">{{TCW|The Soft War}}</ref> granted them new droid [[legion]]s of reinforcements headed by the [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] General [[Kalani]]. The reinforcements were<ref name=\"Databank Kalani\">{{Databank|kalani|Kalani|archivedate=20200527020753}}</ref> delivered in several [[Multi-Troop Transport]]s on the orders of Count Dooku himself.<ref name=\"Front Runners Episode Guide\" /> Later, Saw hid incognito on a city street and helped Steela and more freedom fighters destroy a Confederate Army [[convoy]] that consisted of a Troop [[Transport]], an Assault Tank, and numerous battle droids. Saw single-handedly wrecked the Assault Tank using his training; he blew up the [[hovertank]] agilely using two grenades. Steela then delivered a speech to the Onderonoians who had gathered amid the wreckage. She reminded them that Rash had committed [[treason]] against the Onderon people by selling out the world to the Separatist Alliance and requested that they join Saw and the rebels to reclaim the world and reinstate the rightful king, Ramsis Dendup.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" />\n\n====The King's blessing====\n{{Quote|The Separatists have very little compassion&mdash;or patience&mdash;for things that stand in their way.''\"<br>\"''We have a duty to protect what's ours, General.

Steela surmised that Rash intended to kill his predecessor simply as an example to the rebels; to humiliate the freedom fighters and their cause. Tano reasoned that if Dendup was executed he would become a martyr and bolster the rebel cause. For his part, however, Saw ignored both the words of the war advisor and his sister and took it upon himself to rescue King Dendup before Rash even had a chance to publicly declare Dendup a traitor. Steela ordered Saw to stand down, but Saw, believing that his life was worth the risk of preserving Dendup's, covertly set out nonetheless, unaware that Steela had tasked Dono to tail him.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" />\n\n[[File:Saw_and_Dendup_are_caught.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Saw and King Dendup are detected and arrested in the Unifar Temple courtyard.]]\nAfter donning a [[cloak]], Saw jogged to the foot of the [[Unifar Temple]] in Yolahn Square and scaled the multistory temple utilizing a [[grappling hook]]. Once atop the temple roof, Saw quickly spotted King Dendup in the temple courtyard and beheaded a nearby [[sentry droid]] while making his way to him. Saw bowed before his [[lord]], swearing fealty to the former king and introduced himself, explaining to the king the execution situation. In angst, Dendup chastised Saw for \"interfering with the affairs of the throne\" by forming the resistance and confessed to Saw his failure as Saw's king: by not choosing to ally Onderon with either the Republic or the Confederacy during the Separatist Crisis, a side had been chosen for him;<ref name=\"The Soft War\" /> and as a result of Dendup's choice not to choose, the Onderonian Civil War had broken out,<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\" /> and Onderonians like Saw had stepped up to rectify his errs. Nonplussed, Saw encouraged Dendup, surprising the king with news that the rebels had the support of the Jedi Order. Greatly encouraged, Dendup agreed to escape with Saw, but when Saw fired his grappling hook to escape the royal prison courtyard,<ref name=\"The Soft War Episode Guide\" /> he was frustrated to find that it was blocked by a one-way shield, which alerted the Unifar Temple to the intrusion. As klaxons wailed and spotlights targeted, Saw and Dendup were taken into custody by a sextet of droidekas.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" />\n\nSaw was transferred to the royal central command of the palace, where at Kalani and King Rash's order, Saw was [[Stuncuffs|cuffed]] and hung in a [[containment field]] and placed under interrogation by Kalani.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" /> General [[Akenathen Tandin]]<ref name=\"TCW CE\">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''</ref> of the [[Royal Onderon Militia]] supervised the investigation.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" /> Kalani [[torture]]d Saw for throughout the night but Saw the patriot of Onderon refused to divulge to the droid general any of of the rebel secrets. As a result, Kalani grew increasingly embittered, so he hiked up the dose of electric torture and the longevity of the doses; hoping Saw would break down.<ref name=\"The Soft War Episode Guide\" /> His body smoking from the electricity, Saw held to his beliefs and will and suffered the torture until Kalani and his [[EV-series medical droid]] heightened the electric shocks to great enough wattage to easily kill Saw.

Kalani reluctantly agreed.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" />\n\n[[File:Tandin_Kalani_torture_Saw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saw's torture at the hands of Kalani began his conversion from caring soldier to what many would later call a remorseless madman.]]\nShortly, Saw was given a drink of [[tea]] by Tandin, who questioned why Saw had chosen to rebel against Rash's throne, believing that Onderon's past under the rule of Ramsis Dendup was outdated, and the future was Onderon under Confederate rule.<ref name=\"The Soft War Episode Guide\" /> Saw explained that he chose to rebel because King Rash misused the power of the kingship to empower himself, rather than the people. Saw boomed over Tandin's arguments, proclaiming that he fought in Dendup's name for the former king had chosen to politically fight for the people, therefore not choosing to side with either the Republic or the Confederacy for his own gain as Rash so quickly had.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" /> Saw's words of patriotism weighed heavily on Tandin.<ref name=\"The Soft War Episode Guide\" />\n\nThe next day, Rash and Kalani, escorted by a quartet of [[IG-100 MagnaGuard]]s, marched King Dendup and Saw in chains to the steps of the Unifar Temple overlooking Yolahn Square to their intended executions.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" /> Hundreds of Iziz citizens<ref name=\"The Soft War Episode Guide\" /> gathered to witness the proceedings and listened to Rash's speech, where he declared Dendup and Saw traitors deserving of death by beheading. Rash prepared his MagnaGuards and their [[electrostaff]]s to behead Dendup utilizing an [[electroguillotine]]. However, trooper Dono, having relayed to Steela and Bonteri that Saw had been arrested, put into motion a raid to free Dendup and Saw from the Separatists&mdash;Bonteri tossed [[smoke bomb]]s into the Separatist ranks, causing chaos while Steela and other soldiers extracted Saw and Dendup. Saw even managed to knock Kalani to the ground with his binders before the group began their withdrawal. The retreat was cut short, however, when B2 battle droid reinforcements surrounded Steela's extraction team and forced her troopers to surrender their weapons&mdash;much to the dismay of the Onderonian citizens, who had come to see Saw's rebels as allies, and Rash's Separatists as intruding invaders. Having regained control of the function, Rash prepared to execute Dendup and Saw once more along with the newly incarcerated Steela.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" />\n\n[[File:Tandin_holds_Rash_at_lance_point_Onderon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|General Tandin found true conviction in Saw's words of patriotism and as a result, chose to defect to Saw's rebels.]]\nHaving surrendered to his fate, Saw thanked his sister for her attempt to save his life. General Tandin on the other hand, having heard the truth in Saw's words [[Standard hour|hours]] prior, decided not to surrender Saw and Dendup to the fate Rash intended for them. He then tore into the square with his [[Royal Onderon Militia|Onderon guards]] and held King Rash and Kalani at [[laser lance]] point. Saw was touched and surprised that Tandin had abandoned King Rash's Royal Court, and sided with the Onderonian rebels. Tandin used Rash as a human [[Shield (physical armor)|shield]] and ordered the rebels to flee into the city, thanking Saw for helping him see that he had betrayed the true Onderon by serving King Rash. The Royal Militia followed Saw and the rebels to their safehouse while Tano helped Tandin escape Rash and his forces.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" />\n\nSometime later, Tandin expressed to King Dendup that he had, thanks to well-expressed words from Saw, officially defected from the Separatist-led Onderon Royal Court and pledged himself and his army to Saw's rebels and Dendup. Dendup, like Steela, believed that to win the civil war, they had to win the minds of the people. Saw agreed, and made it his priority to protect Dendup from the Confederate strength of Count Dooku who no doubt wanted Dendup dead more than ever after the day's debacle.<ref name=\"The Soft War\" />\n\n====The true cost of conflict====\n{{Quote|I'm sorry for your loss.''\"''<br >''\"''Thanks, but it's over now.

At the highlands, Saw and the rebels constructed a new base, known as \"[[the nest]];\" named for the rupings who used the highlands as a nesting ground.<ref name=\"Tipping Points Episode Guide\">{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/tipping-points|text=\"Tipping Points\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}</ref> During this time, Padawan Tano and Bonteri enacted a quick mission back to Iziz where they utilized a holographic message of King-in-[[Exile (punishment)|exile]] Dendup declared his allegiance to the Onderon rebels, whom he called patriots of true Onderon. Upon their return, Bonteri informed Saw that the civilians had taken to the Iziz streets to riot as a result of hearing Dendup's message. Encouraged, Saw voiced his desire to join the civilians and take the fight straight to Rash in the streets of Iziz, but Steela, Tano, Tandin, and King Dendup, all disagreed&mdash;they believed the rebels needed to avoid civilian casualties at all costs, thus the Confederate forces had to be drawn out of the crowded city and into the wilderness of the highlands.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\n[[File:BattleOfOnderon-TP.png|thumb|right|250px|Saw swoops over the battlefront, attacking a Separatist droid gunship, on his ruping during the final battle of the Onderonian Civil War.]]\nIt wasn't long before Kalani located the rebels in the highlands and sent his [[army]] out to confront them. Meanwhile, the rebels and Royal [[bodyguard]]s dug into the jungle mesas and prepared to repel the droid infantry. Once the battle of the Onderonian highlands began, Saw led a group of ruping riders, providing air support for the dalgo-mounted cavalry commanded by Tandin. The Confederate forces were caught off-guard by the rebels attack and were mostly destroyed by the rebels diverse forces of rupings, cavalry, snipers, and [[blaster cannon]]s mounted on towering [[fambaa]]s. Saw and his riders swept over the battlefront, destroying the droid's support vehicles with grenades.<ref name=\"Tipping Points Episode Guide\" /> However, before the skirmish could be won, three [[HMP droid gunship]]s entered the fray and systematically turned the tide of battle by killing much of Tandin's cavalry and fambaas. Saw's ruping riders were downed by two, and Saw was forced to hide from the [[Droid starfighter|droid fighters]] and recollect himself. Seizing the next opportunity, Saw bore his ruping towards a distracted [[gunship]] and lobbed a detonator at the [[Repulsorlift|hovering]] droid. However, the detonator did no damage to the craft as it was heavily ray shielded. The gunship next targeted Saw, and it managed to kill his ruping, throwing Saw to the ground. With the battle's tide having turned, Tandin's cavalry retreated, and the Royal General hoisted Saw atop his dalgo as the surviving rebel forces retreated back to the nest in complete disarray.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\nAt the nest, the Gerreras, Tandin, Tano, and Bonteri convened to strategize. Tano explained that she had contacted her Jedi superiors Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and requested aid from the Jedi Council, but he wasn't sure he would be able to help the rebels. Refusing to be discouraged, Steela pointed out that since the droid could not be stopped before reaching the nest, the fort had to be fortified for the incoming invasion. Emboldened by her spirit, Saw expressed how proud he was of his sister. She accredited her skills as a leader to watching Saw.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" /> Saw returned to organize the defense at the battlefront a short distance from the nest, and shortly, Tano, Bonteri, and Steela arrived bearing new armaments provided by Skywalker and Kenobi through the [[Weequay]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]], the [[pirate]] lord of the [[Ohnaka Gang]]: [[Sienar Fleet Systems]] [[RPS-6 rocket launcher]]s. Saw immediately took one of the [[Missile launcher|rocket launchers]] and fired a missile at a nearby gunship. The droid ship was brought down by the single shot; revitalizing the rebels' resolve to fight now that they had a weapon that could deal damage. The launchers were being distributed among the insurgents, when word came that the nest had been found and was under attack by the remaining gunships.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\n[[File:Steela_dies_on_Onderon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Saw cradles his sister in mourning, feeling responsible for her death, which he blamed on himself for the rest of his life.]]\nSteela hurriedly took the rupings with her troops and headed the short distance back atop the [[mesa]]s where the fort was located in order to protect King Dendup.<ref name=\"Tipping Points Episode Guide\" /> Saw, meanwhile, with a pair of soldiers, supported Steela by distracting the gunships. Within minutes, only one gunship remained, and Saw took aim with his launcher and shot down the final droid ship. The mortally damaged ship careened through the sky and smashed into a cliff face where Steela was protecting Dendup from several [[commando]] droids. The weakened cliff face gave way, and Saw was horrified to see that Steela had fallen with it, and was hanging from the cliff edge. Tano began [[Telekinesis|using]] the Force to lift Steela to safety, but the droid gunship remained partially active, and it fired on Tano, striking her in the shoulder with a bolt. Tano's wound disrupted her concentration long enough for her telekinetic hold on Steela to be severed. Saw ran in horror to his fallen sister as she fell to her death on the rocks below. As Saw cradled Steela's lifeless body, he recounted the fact that it had been he who had shot down the gunship.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" /> Saw was racked with a guilt; a guilt he would never banish from his mind.<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\" />\n\nThe rebels emerged victorious over the Separatists in the highlands, and the Confederate defeat prompted Dooku to withdraw Kalani and his forces from Onderon and move to the planet [[Agamar]] due to the apparent long-term conflict the rebels intended to fight. And later in the day, the rebels returned to Iziz, where Dendup was reinstated as King&mdash;Sanjay Rash having been [[assassin]]ated by Kalani on Dooku's orders after the Confederate defeat in the highlands. Later, a [[Funeral of Steela Gerrera|funeral was held]] for Steela on the steps of the Unifar Temple in Yolahn Square. Thousands of Onderonians turned up for the [[funeral]] in mourning over Steela's untimely death. Saw paid his respects over his sister's sarcophagus and rejected Tano and Bonteri's condolences, angry he couldn't prevent Steela's death.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" /> Full of guilt and brokenhearted, Gerrera made it his mission to continue his battle against all forms of what he considered evil.<ref name=\"TCW CE\" />\n\n====Siege at Onderon====\n{{Dialogue|Admiral Yularen|Sir, we've received a transmission from someone using your subspace frequency \"Fulcrum.\"|General Skywalker|Saw Gerrera?|General Kenobi|Perhaps the siege at Onderon has taken a turn for the worse.|Admiral Yularen|No, sir, it's not Gerrera.|attr=Admiral Yularen, General Skywalker, and General Kenobi during the battle of [[Yerbana]]|src= Old Friends Not Forgotten}}\nDespite their victory in the Civil War,<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" /> Onderon and Gerrera were not free from conflict.

Believing the Empire's existence to pose a threat to all they had fought for during the Clone Wars, Gerrera and his militia began pushing back against the Empire, drawing the attention of Admiral [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. In response, Tarkin deployed experimental [[Clone Force 99]] to deal with Gerrera's faction, though also as a test of Clone Force 99's loyalty. Upon arriving and seeing Gerrera's group, the squad refused to execute their orders, save for [[CT-9904|Crosshair]], who insisted on fulfilling the mission. Gerrera and his men apprehended the squad of clones, but soon released them, giving [[Hunter]], the squad's leader, a chance to pick a side.

The smugglers were to deliver arms to resistance fighters in the [[Salient system]], however, this smuggling ring was the brainchild of [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]]. Krennic was using small uprisings as an excuse to take control of planets heavy in resources needed to build the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. Obitt had revealed this information to his smuggler partners, and they decided to double-cross the Empire. When they arrived at Salient, it became clear that the Empire was expecting to arrest Obitt and the other mercenaries. Gerrera convinced Obitt to stay and fight the Empire. The people of the Salient system eventually lost the battle and Obitt was captured and later released by [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]; Gerrera, however, was able to escape.<ref name=\"Catalyst\" />\n\n====Helping the Ersos====\nIn 17 BBY, Obitt came in contact with [[Lyra Erso]].

Kestis felt honored by the offer, but he refused because he could not abandon his mission. Gerrera said the offer continues before it leaves.

To help prevent this, Saw tortured Partisans to assess if they knew of Jyn's identity, even disposing of [[Jari]] at an unknown Imperial [[barracks]] due to the same reason. With the constant worry of others finding out Jyn's identity Saw decided, when Jyn was sixteen, to abandon her in a bunker with nothing more than a knife and a blaster for protection.

While the Spectres [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[C1-10P|Chopper]] pursued the Geonosian, Saw waited with Kanan and Rex when the Spectres' leader [[Hera Syndulla]] contacted Kanan. When Hera told them to leave, Saw convinced the Spectres to delay their stay so that they could complete his original mission to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. Using [[the Force]], Kanan used a stone bridge to ferry Saw and Rex safely across to the other side of the air shaft.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nOnce they had crossed, Saw and his rebel companions managed to corner Klik-Klak. Saw also shot out Klik Klak's remote controller with his blaster; deactivating several droidekas which were attacking the Spectres [[Sabine Wren]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]] above. Saw then interrogated Klik-Klak and demanded to know what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Unable to speak [[Galactic Basic Standard]], Klik-Klak drew in the sand repeatedly. Ezra managed to befriend Klik-Klak. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to lead them to the source.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nSaw and his companions soon discovered the energy reading came from [[Klik-Klak's nest]], which served as his workshop and contained a [[Transmitter/Legends|transmitter]]. Still bitter about the loss of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists, Saw aggressively questioned Klik-Klak and rummaged through his place. Saw's aggressive methods yielded no results while Ezra's gentler methods convinced Klik-Klak to reveal that he was the custodian of the last known Geonosian queen egg. Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak off-world but Ezra objected on the grounds that Klik-Klak and the egg were among the last of their species and belonged on Geonosis. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise whereby the rebels could question Klik-Klak at Chopper Base and then return him to Geonosis.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nSaw, his rebel allies and their prisoner Klik-Klak rendezvoused with the Spectres' ship ''[[Ghost]]'' in the central air shaft. Once aboard, Saw exchanged pleasantries with Hera and the rest of her crew. While Kanan and Hera were preoccupied, Saw reneged on his earlier agreement and tried to take Klik-Klak off-world on the shuttle ''[[Phantom II]]''. To force Klik-Klak's cooperation, Saw shocked him with an electro-shock device. This sparked an argument with the Spectres and Rex, who all objected to Saw's harsh methods. After fighting off Ezra and Rex, Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg. In response, Ezra and Rex urged him not to become like the Empire he was fighting against.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nSaw's argument with the Spectres was interrupted by the arrival of [[Captain]] [[Brunson]]'s [[Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]], which blocked the air shaft and deployed a squad of [[Jumptrooper]]s to board the ''Ghost''. Saw joined the rebels in repelling the Imperial boarders as the ship descended into the depths of Geonosis. Once at the bottom, Saw and his rebel comrades discovered several poison canisters which provided compelling evidence that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. Regretting his past behavior towards Klik-Klak, Saw argued that the Geonosians deserved the same right to rebuild as other peoples and released Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nAfter releasing Klik-Klak and taking several of the poison canisters, the ''Ghost'' managed to escape Geonosis by blasting through the Imperial light cruiser with [[proton torpedo]]es. Despite their successful escape, the rebels lost the poison canisters and were forced to make do with images of the canisters instead. Though Senator Organa and Commander [[Jun Sato]] regarded the mission as a success for rescuing Saw and obtaining a new [[deflector core]], Saw was disappointed that they still had not found out what the Empire was building on Geonosis.

Upon opening the doors to drop bombs, he was surprised to see Ezra and Sabine, greeting the two while tossing out three packs of proton bombs onto the relay.

Upon arriving at Faos Station, he, Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper boarded [[Freighter 2716]].<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\nUpon investigating the materials, which were used for the construction of Star Destroyers, Saw claimed that the Empire was up to something. Continuing his investigation, they found Imperial stormtroopers on the ship and learned that the freighter was heading towards the remote [[Tonnis sector]], cementing Saw's suspicions. When Chopper told him that hold 12 contained an Imperial shuttle, they went in and found prisoners, who were either power or reactor technicians. Later on when Ezra kept hearing \"singing,\" Chopper revealed that hold 17 was a restricted area. Upon opening the door to that hold, they encountered a [[death trooper]], prompting Saw to fire at point-blank range, killing the trooper. Sabine tossed several smoke grenades into the room, which Saw used to blend in and take down several troopers.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\nAfter clearing the area, [[DT-F16|one of the troopers]] managed to escape. Saw wanted to go after her, but Sabine told him not to. They inspected the mysterious cargo the troopers were protecting and realized that it was an unusually large [[kyber crystal]]. Saw, adamant in finding out what the Empire was building, reluctantly stayed to guard the [[crystal]] while Ezra and Sabine went to sabotage the hyperspace drive. However, he quickly betrayed them and stunned the two in the engine room.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\nWhen Ezra and Sabine woke up, they asked Saw why he betrayed them. Saw stated that they were very close to finding out the secret weapon and told them to look on the screen. When the freighter arrived at the Tonnis sector, they only saw a single Star Destroyer. Confused, but still convinced of the Empire's nefarious designs with the crystal, he used Ezra's lightsaber to destroy the freighter's hyperdrive before firing onto the crystal's mounting, effectively turning the crystal into a time bomb. He then freed the two, while Edrio, who had tailed the freighter, informed Saw that he was outside. Knowing that Ezra and Sabine no longer agreed with his methods, Saw bid farewell to them while they made their individual escapes before the freighter and Star Destroyer were obliterated.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\n====Mission to Dooma 4====\n{{Quote|Hold On!

By this time, Gerrera had lost his right leg and struggled to walk on a low-grade [[Cybernetics|cybernetic replacement]]. His [[lung]]s had also been damaged, confining him to a [[Saw Gerrera's pressurized suit|pressurized armor suit]] and requiring him to regularly take supplementary [[oxygen]] from a [[breath mask]].<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\nHaving previously learned that the Empire's massive kyber crystal had come from [[Jedha]], Gerrera relocated his militia to the moon, feeling that it was an appropriate place to bring his rebellion, as it was a sacred world to many different galactic religions.<ref name=\"Guardians of the Whills\" /><ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\" /> Due to the Imperials defiling many religious temples and artifacts in their pursuit of kyber crystals, small, local insurgent cells had begun forming in the Holy City of NiJedha in opposition to the occupation. From his new base of operations in the [[Catacombs of Cadera]], just a half-day's walk outside the Holy City, Gerrera began recruiting and organizing the local insurgencies under the umbrella of his Partisans. During this time, he also held command over a pair of UT-60D U-wing troop transports and six T-65 X-wing fighters.<ref name=\"Saw Gerrera card\">{{FFGXW|Saw's Renegades Expansion Pack|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Saw_Gerrera_(U-Wing)|cardname=Saw Gerrera (U-Wing)}}</ref> Calling them the [[Cavern Angels]], Gerrera began deploying this squadron in hit-and-run air raids against Imperial facilities in the Holy City, as well as the outlying, Imperial-controlled kyber mines.\n\nAmong the local insurgents Gerrera recruited were [[Guardians of the Whills]] [[Chirrut \u00cemwe]] and [[Baze Malbus]], whom he enticed into joining by providing much needed provisions for the [[Gimm sisters' orphanage|orphanage]] run by \u00cemwe and Malbus's friends, [[Kaya Gimm|Kaya]] and [[Killi Gimm]]. Over several months, the Partisans attacked the Imperial occupiers, leading to harsher and harsher reprisals from the Empire. The Star Destroyer that had previously orbited high over Jedha descended to rest right above the Holy City, and the number of [[stormtrooper]]s, tanks, and walkers on patrol in the streets increased significantly. \u00cemwe and Malbus came to Gerrera asking for assistance stealing a spacecraft so the Gimm sisters could flee the planet with their orphans. A group of Partisans, led by [[Beezer Fortuna]], helped \u00cemwe and Malbus steal a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class shuttle]]. Under the orders of Gerrera, Fortuna and the other Partisans attempted to double-cross \u00cemwe and Malbus, wishing to use the shuttle to blow up the Star Destroyer over the city. \u00cemwe and Malbus were able to talk the Partisans out of taking the shuttle, allowing the orphans to escape Jedha. However, this led to Gerrera parting ways with \u00cemwe and Malbus.<ref name=\"Guardians of the Whills\" />\n\n====Reuniting with Jyn and death====\n{{Quote|Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!|Saw Gerrera, to Jyn Erso, as Jedha is ripped apart|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}\n[[File:Saw_Gerrera_with_cane.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gerrera meeting with Jyn Erso.]]\nIn [[0 BBY]], just prior to the [[Battle of Scarif]], the Partisans captured [[Bodhi Rook]], a recently defected Imperial pilot. Bodhi carried a message from Galen Erso, who was trying to alert the Rebellion to the nearly-completed Death Star project. However, increasingly paranoid and believing that Imperial spies were everywhere, Gerrera was convinced that the defection was a trick by the Empire. To ascertain the truth, Gerrera used a [[mairan]] named [[Bor Gullet]] to read Rook's mind, at the risk of driving him insane. Afterward, he left the catatonic Rook in a cell, before deploying his men under Benthic and Edrio to attack an Imperial kyber convoy in [[Jedha City]]. In the ensuing firefight, [[Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service|Rebel intelligence]] Captain [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]], along with Jyn Erso, were captured: both were on the moon in search of Rook, whom the Rebel Alliance had learned had a message from Galen Erso.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\nJyn and Cassian, along with \u00cemwe and Malbus, who had been caught up in the fighting, were brought to Saw's headquarters in the Catacombs of Cadera. Saw would see only Jyn. He questioned her on why she was there, demanding to know if she was there to kill him. She told him that she was there to ask for the message from her father and when it was given to the Rebel Alliance she would be on her way. Saw asked her why she did not believe in the dream of freedom throughout the galaxy. She told him about how he abandoned her at the age of sixteen and that his war did not mean anything to her. He then showed her the message from her father which revealed the weakness in the Empire's superweapon. However, as they spoke, [[Grand Moff]] Wilhuff Tarkin and Orson Krennic had resolved to test-fire the Death Star's [[superlaser]] on Jedha, having traced Bodhi there and seeing an opportunity to wipe out Saw's insurgency. A low-power shot [[Destruction of Jedha City|wiped out]] Jedha City in an instant and created a blast wave that spread for kilometers in every direction, threatening the Catacombs. Realizing the threat, Saw released his prisoners, commending Galen's message to Jyn and begging her to save the Rebellion. However, he declared that he would \"not run any longer\" and remained in the Catacombs. After seeing Jyn's party escape, his last act was to tear off his breath mask before the blast wave consumed the Catacombs, killing him.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> His last thoughts were for his late sister Steela, and his last word was her name.<ref name=\"RO 3\">[[Rogue One Adaptation 3|''Rogue One Adaptation'' 3]]</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|We call ourselves the Dreamers.''\"<br />\"''Dreamers?

He also disliked the Geonosians due to their alignment with the Separatists and for building gunships which led to his sister Steela's death. This coupled by the loss of his comrades during a mission on Geonosis led him to brutally interrogate the Geonosian Klik-Klak, much to the discomfort of his former comrade Rex and the Spectres.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nDespite his antipathy towards the Geonosians, Gerrera was horrified by the Empire's genocide against the species and believed that they had the same right to rebuild as other species. Gerrera's change of heart led him to release Klik-Klak and the [[Karina|Geonosian queen egg]] he was guarding. Gerrera disagreed with the Jedi's principled tactics and believed that it cost them the Clone Wars. Gerrera also opposed the Empire and was prepared to defeat it through any means necessary.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" /> When he met the Padawan Cal Kestis, Saw offered him a place in his rebel group, acknowledging that a Jedi would aid the Partisans in their fight against the Empire. When Kestis refused because he had his own [[Secret mission to rebuild the Jedi Order|mission]], Gerrera said the invitation continued, not giving up on the idea of \u200b\u200bhaving Kestis, a Jedi, on the side of the Partisans.   <ref name=\"Jedi: Fallen Order\" />\n\n===Strained relationships===\n{{Quote|I'm not a terrorist. I'm a patriot. And resistance is not terrorism.|Saw Gerrera|The Soft War}}\nGerrera's aggressive tactics including the killing of prisoners, civilians and violations of the rules of engagement created strife with Mon Mothma, the leader of the Rebel Alliance. Gerrera regarded Mothma as weak and indecisive while Mothma regarded him as a war criminal and terrorist. Gerrera saw potential in Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper as effective soldiers for a mission to discover the Empire's secret superweapon. However, Gerrera's willingness to risk the lives of civilians in this quest strained his partnership with Ezra and Sabine. Ezra, who initially admired Gerrera's ability to acquire intelligence, became disillusioned with his ruthless and aggressive tactics.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" /> Gerrera believed that if a planet was lost, then there was no other option but to leave, which put him at odds with fellow Partisan [[Mari Kosan]], who chose to stay with the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"Jedi: Fallen Order\" />\n\nGerrera became a mentor to Jyn Erso after she lost her parents to the Empire. He abandoned her at the age of sixteen in order to protect her from other rebels who wanted to use her as a hostage due to her status as Galen Erso's daughter. Gerrera initially did not believe the Imperial defector Bodhi Rook's report that the Empire was building a new [[superweapon]] called the Death Star and had him tortured with a Bor Gullet. Despite his estranged relationship with Jyn, Gerrera was still able to inspire her to find the weakness in the Empire's superweapon in order to save the rebellion. Gerrera was unafraid of death and stayed behind when the Empire destroyed the Jedha Holy City.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\nRuthless though he was, Gerrera carried several regrets throughout his life.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> He felt responsible for the death of his sister, Steela. Thus, he vowed to keep up his war against what he saw as evil, no matter what form his enemies took.<ref name=\"TCW CE\" /> He felt that he failed his homeworld of Onderron after the Empire rose to power.{{Fact}} Despite justifying his reasons for doing so, he deeply regretted abandoning Jyn Erso and leaving her on her own.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|I will do whatever is required to be the victor.|Saw Gerrera, to Ezra Bridger|In the Name of the Rebellion}}\n[[File:Saw_Gerrera_SWDL.png|thumb|right|225px|Gerrera was a ruthless and headstrong yet successful leader]]\nAs a seasoned veteran of the Clone Wars, Saw Gerrera was a skilled and cunning fighter and commander who learned combative arts from the [[Jedi]]<ref name=\"Saw Gerrera Databank\" />; he was skilled in [[hand-to-hand combat]], able to overpower both Ezra and Rex<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" /> could easily incapacitate both [[stormtrooper]]s and [[death trooper]]s.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" /> He was also versed in the usage of various melee weaponry including a staff, truncheons, and knives in addition to ranged weaponry.
