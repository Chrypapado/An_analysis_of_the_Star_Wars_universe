After the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation's]] attempted invasion of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] she traveled to the planet with her family to try and negotiate a trade contract with the government there. Whilst on Naboo her son [[Pellum Cordoni]] however fell in love with the daughter of a rival trade delegate and ran away with her causing Hella to hire a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] to find him.\n\n==Biography==\nHella Cordoni prior to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] in the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] where she worked as a trade delegate and raised a family including her son, [[Pellum Cordoni]]. In 32 BBY the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] lead by the [[Neimoidian/Legends|Neimoidian]] [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]]<ref name=\"TPM\">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> attempted to [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|invade]] the [[Mid Rim]]<ref name=\"EAWGG\">''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> planet of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] unsuccessfully, this still however caused considerable damage to the planet's government and population. Seeing a business opportunity she brought her entire family to Naboo where she planned to set up permanent residence and attempted to petition the recovering government for a trade agreement.\n\nHella however was not the only trade delegate to seize the opportunity and she quickly became rivals with the [[Human/Legends|Human]] trade master [[Van Kellen]] from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] who had also moved to Naboo with his family to petition for trade agreements. Both parties' rivalries however did not extent too their children and Pellum and Kellen's daughter [[Remi Kellen]] soon became romantically involved in secret. When Hella and Kellen found out about this relationship they were both outraged and placed great amounts of pressure on the pair to break up. This instead caused the pair too steal a [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] and flee together from their controlling parents. Hella and her rival then quickly hired a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] visiting Naboo to find their lost children and return them.\n\nThe spacers discovered the pair had fled to the city of [[Keren/Legends|Keren]] were they had purchased supplies to move into the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] swamps. The outfitter who had sold them said goods however was involved with a number of criminal organizations including a slaver ring that had captured the pair of lovers as they left the city. The spacers, ambushed by the [[Slaver/Legends|slavers]] themselves set out to free the pair and complete their contract. Whether they were successful or not and returned Pellum to Hella is unknown.<ref name=\"Secrets of Naboo\" />\n\n==Personality==\nHella was an even tempered and cautious business woman but clearly placed huge importance on her work, moving her entire family to follow a business opportunity and becoming angry at her sons love for a rival instead of supporting him. As she paid for Pellum's rescue however she clearly did care for her family above her profit.<ref name=\"Secrets of Naboo\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHella Cordoni was created as part of the adventure idea \"young love... what a pain!\" which was included in the [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]] supplement book [[Secrets of Naboo]], published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] and written by [[Steve Miller]] and [[J.D. Wiker]]. The short story was included to give game masters ideas for their own story lines or to be expanded upon and used as the basis for a short adventure. Hella acted as the one of the possible starting points for the adventure who would give the players their mission as well as the individual who would presumably reward them for their success.<ref name=\"Secrets of Naboo\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizCite|Secrets of Naboo|Young love... what a pain!}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cordoni, Hella}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
