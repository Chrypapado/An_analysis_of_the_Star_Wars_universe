She was tasked with killing the [[Shi'ido]] anthropologist [[Mammon Hoole]] and his two charges, [[Tash Arranda/Legends|Tash]] and [[Zak Arranda/Legends|Zak Arranda]], and was offered a hefty reward if she were to succeed. [[Dannik Jerriko]] killed her before she could get to the Arranda children and Hoole.\n\nShe was valued as an assassin by the Empire because she had no qualms with murdering children and women. Her matronly and grandmother-like nature and false kindness often allowed her to gain the trust of her victims, so that she could move in for the kill with her target off-guard.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Galaxy of Fear: Ghost of the Jedi]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Domisari\n}}\n\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
