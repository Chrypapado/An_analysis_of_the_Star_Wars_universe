He was mostly a paranoid, disgruntled, austere person who did not like to drink even in the traditional drunkenness of paydays. Bli'Mora disliked Nirama, which would make him a prospective member of the faction wanting to outs him, [[The Cell]]. However, Bli'Mora thought that the Cell members in Darkside, including [[Jasper]], were incompetent.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[MidWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cereans]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
