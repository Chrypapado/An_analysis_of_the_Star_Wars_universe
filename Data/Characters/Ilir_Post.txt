As a result, Post's father arranged for Fel to be sent to the [[Academy of Carida]], to prevent him from testifying at Ilir's [[Corellian Security Force|Corsec]] trial. This left Ilir with a hatred for Fel, however, Post later did time on [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]].\n\nIn [[4 ABY/Legends|4.5 ABY]], he took [[Fyric Fel]] hostage, as an [[Mission to Corellia (Rogue Squadron)|attempt]] to find the location of [[Syal Antilles Fel|Wynssa Starflare]].
