She fell in love with and married [[Menir]], a [[farmer]] who lived on the outskirts of town. Over time, Menir became harsh and unwilling to allow any change, which meant that when Elise invited the traveler [[Iren]] into their home, Menir became furious and attacked him. Iren left a bag containing three seeds behind, which Menir mocked and threw outside. Before long, the seeds had grown into monsters called [[Drengir]], which destroyed Menir's house, killing Elise.<ref name=\"ABH\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=A Bitter Harvest|book=Dark Legends}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]"}}}]}}}}
