Darkness allows us to understand others, to see what they value when they believe no one else is looking. It allows us to be honest with ourselves, to express those values that we would disavow in the light. The light blinds us. It is only in the dark that we see clearly, and there is a great dark hidden among these worlds.|Darth Rivan|The Darkstaff}}\n'''Darth Rivan''' was a [[Zelosian]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who was a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] during the time of the [[New Sith Wars]]. He took his [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] name from a corrupted Sith manuscript which incorrectly identified [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] who was redeemed during the [[Jedi Civil War]], as \"Rivan.\"<ref name=\"Star Wars Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[New Sith Wars]], Darth Rivan visited the uncharted [[Cularin system]] and settled on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]], despite the planet's inhospitable atmosphere. There, he built a [[Almas Sith fortress|fortress]], intending to delve in the mysteries of the dark side.<ref name=\"LFCG 37\" />\n\nRivan's ''true'' purpose for constructing the fortress, however, lay in the creation of [[Sith battlelord]]s. Rivan's vision for this elite new corps lay in the very nature of the dark side itself; specifically, in its inherent discord. Whenever many [[darksider]]s gathered in one location, sooner or later some of them would die, or turn on one another. Enlightened inter-cooperation was not held to be a virtue by darksiders. Eliminating insubordination amongst the Sith ranks became a mission of Rivan's, and his creation of the battlelord would serve to [[Force bond]] a commander to his troops&mdash;if a soldier attempted to harm his/her commander, the intended wound would instead be inflicted upon the soldier.<ref name=\"battlelords\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050901sithbattlelords|text=Sith Battlelords|int=Sith Battlelords (article)|archivedate=20100520071449}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Almas.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Rivan's adopted [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of Almas]]\nAnalysis of the fortress performed shortly after the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]] revealed that the dome on the fortress was well over 1,000 years old. The fortress itself was essentially a gigantic [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] focal-point, capable of shooting lightning at passing [[Starship/Legends|starships]].<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nThe castle was plagued with mechanical traps which could not be detected with the Force or with advanced technological means. Rivan would use [[Mandalorian iron]], resistant to the Force and to the lightsaber, to keep his most valued books, and for the floor of his lightsaber training room. He also designed the fortress so that his slaves/prisoners (which included at least one Jedi) would be cut off from the Force, feeling absolutely lost and despaired. Darth Rivan wrote his autobiography in [[Sith (language)|Sithese]] in the inner walls of his fortress.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nDarth Rivan was known for being the wielder of the powerful artifact known as the [[Darkstaff]], a semi-sentient weapon capable of draining Force-essence from a living being.<ref name=\"DSt\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030807darkstaff|text=The Darkstaff|int=The Darkstaff|archivedate=20091016035002}}</ref>\n\nDarth Rivan also created the [[kaluthin]] grass to modify the planet's landscape and atmosphere, and make it breathable. Although the kaluthin terraformed Almas to a gardenlike place, it could not remove the noxious local gases and Almas's atmosphere would never be exactly pure.<ref name=\"LFCG 37\" />\n\nRivan lived in Almas for decades until driven off by the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Knights]], at some point before [[1250 BBY]]. During the [[Battle of Almas]], the Jedi destroyed Rivan's fortress structure, although the core tower, impervious to blaster fire, survived the attack.<ref name=\"LFCG 37\" />\n\nIn the end, it was known that Rivan's quest for physical immortality never truly succeeded. It was initially believed that, after being driven off Almas by a massive Jedi/[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] assault, Darth Rivan barely escaped with his life, and eventually perished after being betrayed by his fellow Sith<ref name=\"Vader: The Ultimate Guide\">''[[Vader: The Ultimate Guide]]''</ref>&mdash;specifically, his own apprentice,<ref name=\"battlelords\" /> [[Darsin]].\n\nIn actuality, however, Rivan left the fortress one day leaving Darsin behind, and Darsin died before Rivan, his body modified by Rivan's alchemies to create a slave Force spirit. Rivan managed to harness the power of the Darkstaff to create a [[Force storm (wormhole)|Force storm]] that swept him through time and space to the planet [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]], during the battles between the Jedi [[Army of Light/Legends|Army of Light]] and the Sith [[Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends|Brotherhood of Darkness]] several centuries later.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" /> There, with his Force power drained by the Darkstaff, he was easily slain by a Force-sensitive warrior, someone who had been another apprentice of Rivan (but not Darsin). Rivan could not be buried in the crypt he had created for himself.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nPortions of Rivan's journals were excavated and recovered from his Almas fortress during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and presented to the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for study.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRivan was well known for the power to form the [[Sith battlelord]]s. Rivan has shown in his fortress that he studied and applied himself to mastering the dark side. Rivan's most noticeable creation was the [[kaluthin]] grass to modify the planet Almas' atmosphere in order to make it breathable.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRivan is chronologically the last known [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] before [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]]. Initially, Bane was believed to be the inventor of the title, as at that point, no earlier Sith Lords used it. It was later revealed that the title \"Darth\" originates in the [[Mandalorian Wars]], or even earlier. Darth Rivan predates Bane, author of the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]]. However, one of the traps in Darth Rivan's fortress, as shown in ''[[A Mon Alone]]'', is based on the Sith adherence to the Rule of Two.\n\nRivan has never actually been featured or mentioned in a story. So far, both he and the Almas fortress have only been mentioned in source books and role playing scenarios.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Kaluthin Are Always Greener]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Recursion]]'' {{Mo}} {{C|Under ''GM Aid #2: History of the Shadow Lurkers''}}\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=Echoes of the Jedi|int=Echoes of the Jedi|archivedate=20100118064618}} {{Holocron}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020425asithfortress&c=swlfc|text=The Sith Fortress|int=The Sith Fortress|archivedate=20021001233031}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020708bdragon&c=swlfc|text=Dragon of the Desert|int=Dragon of the Desert|archivedate=20030813173007}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlfalmas|text=Almas|int=Almas (article)|archivedate=20090603073011}} {{1stm}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030807darkstaff|text=The Darkstaff|int=The Darkstaff|archivedate=20091016035002}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20041209|text=Tramsig's Plan|int=Tramsig's Plan|archivedate=20091016001955}}\n*''[[Vader: The Ultimate Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050901sithbattlelords|text=Sith Battlelords|int=Sith Battlelords (article)|archivedate=20100520071449}}\n*''[[The Eye]]'' {{C|Under ''GM Overview'' and ''GM Aid #2: The Darkstaff''}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/88/indexp2.html|text=Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties|int=Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties|archivedate=20110629021310}} {{C|Under ''The New Sith''}}\n*{{Blog|abelgpena|91|\"I am Zannah\": or, A Darth By Any Other Name, Part 3|Only Sith Deal In Absolutes!|Abel G.
