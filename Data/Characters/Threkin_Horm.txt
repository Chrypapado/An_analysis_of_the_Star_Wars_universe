Before the planet's [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]], his family controlled a spaceline that serviced Alderaan. Because he was grossly overweight, Horm often traveled in a [[Power chair|repulsorlift chair]] in his later [[Standard year/Legends|years]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Horm served as [[President/Legends|President]] of the [[Alderaanian Council]]. After the [[Battle of New Alderaan (Hunt for Zsinj)|First Battle of New Alderaan]], the Council was dealing with the problem of resettling the refugees of [[New Alderaan/Legends|New Alderaan]], who were previously refugees from Alderaan. When [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Isolder]] asked fellow [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] to marry him, Horm believed that her acceptance of the offer could solve the refugee problem. As [[Queen Mother]] of the [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]], Leia could find a suitable planet for the refugees to settle within the star cluster.\n\nAs Horm pressured Leia to accept the offer he earned the lasting enmity of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who was also courting her. Thus, Horm arranged for Solo to take a Star Destroyer to the [[Roche system]], sending him far away from Coruscant so that Leia would forget about him, but Solo kidnapped the Princess in response. This eventually indirectly resulted in the revelation that Horm's mother was the illegitimate daughter of [[Dalla Solo|Dalla Suul]], a notorious [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]]-which, assuming Han Solo was Suul's grandson, would make them half-cousins.\n\nHorm later attempted to illegally sell ''[[Killik Twilight]]'' at an auction on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] (in fact it was very likely that he had illegally acquired the moss-painting in the first place). Han and Leia, who had come to the planet to purchase the painting discovered that he was the person who was auctioning it off&mdash;with [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]] being among the other prospective buyers. Han and Leia blackmailed Horm into not selling the moss-painting but this decision resulted in a melee. During the fight, Horm was hit by a number of toxic darts, which carried a fast-acting neurotoxin that killed him.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[Kevin J. Anderson]] originally intended to include Threkin Horm in his books [[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']] and ''[[Champions of the Force]]'', but a typographical error was committed, resulting in the creation of the character known as [[Hrekin Thorm]]. This may serve as a sort of out-of-universe explanation as to why Thorm's character was in favor of the execution of [[Kyp Durron]] for the destruction of [[Carida/Legends|Carida]]. This may also explain why he is still present in that novel, considering the fact that he was killed on Tatooine.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Courtship of Princess Leia]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|67|The Trouble with Squibs}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Threkin Horm\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horm, Threkin}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:House of Solo]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
