He grew up on an [[Allied Grain and Roughage]] [[agro-combine]], where he learned the values of loyalty, duty, and hard work from his [[Fel dynasty|family]]. He married [[Ajai Fel]], and together they had a son, [[Fyric Fel|Fyric]], around [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]]. Soontir's success allowed him to gain a [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|barony]] and an [[Fel estate|estate]], on which Fel and his family were allowed to live.\n\nNearly [[5 ABY/Legends|five years]] after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Soontir was captured by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], and [[Syal Antilles Fel|his wife]] fled into hiding with their children to avoid Imperial retaliation. Hoping to pressure the Fels into divulging her location, [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] backed [[Ilir Post]] in kidnapping his son, Fyric. Determined not to betray his family or to let his son be used against him, Fel used three New Republic [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] sent by [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], Soontir's brother-in-law, to place a [[Homing beacon/Legends|tracker]] on Post and draw him out. Fel killed Post with a [[Sniper/Legends|sniper]] shot, risking Fyric's [[Death/Legends|death]] when he fell from the balcony on which Post held him, because Fel felt it was the only case in which Fyric had any chance of living. One of the New Republic pilots caught Fyric, and the three pilots took Todr, Ajai, and Fyric Fel to safety in the New Republic.\n\n==Biography==\n===Life on Corellia===\n{{Quote|Fels take care of their own.|Todr Fel, to Corran Horn|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties}}\n[[File:Todr-kid.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Fel as a child with his mother in 10 BBY.]]\nTodr Fel was born into the [[Fel dynasty|Fel family]], nearly all the members of which worked for [[Allied Grain and Roughage]]. Fel's [[Soontir Fel's father|father]] worked as a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] for AGR, and Fel's family was raised on an AGR [[agro-combine]]. Fel had at least two brothers and one sister, and grew up with the Fel family's strict sense of duty and loyalty to each other. Around [[10 BBY/Legends|10 BBY]], his father was accidentally poisoned, and Fel's older brother, [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir]], began flying his routes for him. In 10 BBY, Soontir broke up an attempted rape by [[Ilir Post]], a son of a member of AGR's board. He was given an appointment to the [[Academy of Carida]], which kept him from testifying on the matter. In exchange, AGR made sure that the Fels were provided for and did not punish their father for having let Soontir operate AGR equipment without official authorization.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" />\n\nFel carried on his life on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], marrying a woman by the name of [[Ajai Fel|Ajai]]. Around late [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], Fel became a father, with Ajai giving birth to a son, [[Fyric Fel|Fyric]].<ref name=\"Family Ties\" /> In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Fel moved into far more luxurious conditions when Soontir, who had achieved great fame as an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[TIE pilot|pilot]], was made a [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron of the Empire]] and given a massive [[Fel estate|estate]] on Corellia. All Soontir's relations were moved to the estate, where they lived in comfort.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" /> The Fels were joined there by [[Syal Antilles Fel|Wynssa Starflare]], Soontir's wife, and her two children, [[Chak Fel|Chak]] and [[Davin Fel|Davin]].<ref name=\"Fact File 122\">''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 122]]''</ref> Fel was trusted with the dangerous knowledge that Starflare had been born Syal Antilles, and was the sister of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] hero [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]]. For that reason, Starflare had plans to flee if her identity was ever exposed to [[Ysanne Isard]], the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] and a nemesis of Soontir Fel.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" /><ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" />\n\nAround nine months after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Soontir was captured by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] in an [[Battle of Brentaal IV (Galactic Civil War)|engagement]] over [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]].<ref name=\"In the Empire's Service\">[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: In the Empire's Service|''In the Empire's Service'']]</ref> Starflare, fearful of Imperial retaliation, took Chak and Davin and went into hiding.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" /><ref name=\"Fact File 122\" />\n\n===Kidnapping===\n{{Dialogue|Estillo|Todr?

Todr and his family quickly realized that it was an attempt to uncover the location of Starflare, and resolved to resist, even when the kidnappers gave them a meeting point. [[Corellian Security Force]] investigators [[Corran Horn]] and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]] were assigned to the case and began investigating the grounds and interviewing the Fels. Later in the day, a group of three strangers came by the house, claiming to be friends; Fel was called over by Horn, and the strangers' use of \"Wedge\" convinced Fel that they were sent by Antilles to make contact. He suggested they come back later.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n[[File:Todr-Fyric.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fel is reunited with his son.]]\n\nAs the strangers had given Fel their [[Hangar/Legends|docking bay]] number, [[Docking Bay 385|385]], he sent Ajai to them, having her claim that she was angry that the Fels would not give up Starflare's location to save Fyric, and gave them a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] of Fyric&mdash;one with a tracking device built in. Ajai claimed that she would give them Starflare if they could retrieve Fyric, and sent them to the rendezvous the kidnappers had arranged. During the meeting, [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo]], one of the New Republic pilots Antilles had sent, gave the hologram to Ilir Post, the self-appointed nemesis of Soontir Fel and the leader of the kidnappers, backed by [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]].<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\nFel used the tracker signal to travel to the remote estate Post was using as his hideout. He let the CorSec agents and [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] pilots storm the estate, but Post appeared on a balcony, holding Fyric and threatening to kill the child if they did not leave. Fel, knowing that Fyric would eventually [[Death/Legends|die]] if they did so, decided that while shooting Post would risk Fyric falling off the balcony, it was less risky than letting Post live. From the woods, he lined up a [[Sniper/Legends|sniper]] shot that took Post directly in the forehead, killing him instantly. Fyric tumbled over the edge, but was saved by Estillo's diving catch. Fel was waiting when the group came back to the woods, and gladly accepted his son back, explaining how he had tracked Post.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n[[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]], one of the Rogue pilots, tried to persuade Fel that he and his family should take refuge in the New Republic, now that Soontir had defected to them and was flying for Rogue Squadron. Fel spoke with the rest of his family, and it was decided that he and Ajai should take Fyric to the New Republic and out of danger. The next day, they packed up and flew from Corellia with the Rogues. They came under attack by [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] working for Imperial Intelligence on their way out, but timely assistance by Horn allowed them to escape safely.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You were here when we arrived and used us to draw him out.
