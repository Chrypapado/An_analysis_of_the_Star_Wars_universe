Your preferences don't come into it. Your enemy won't stand down just because you don't want to fight. You either rise to the occasion or you die.|Wynssa Fel, to Jacen Solo|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\n'''Wynssa Fel''', called '''Wyn''' by her family, was the younger daughter of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]] and [[Syal Antilles Fel]]. An exuberant and excitable child, she could also be serious and military-minded, a quality expected in one raised among the strict [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] in the harsh [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]&mdash;first on [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]] within the [[Empire of the Hand]] and then on [[Csilla/Legends|Csilla]], the capital of the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]].\n\nIn [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]], while still in her early teens, Fel helped [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]], [[Saba Sebatyne]], and [[Danni Quee]] research the location of [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]] when they arrived at the [[Expeditionary Library]] on Csilla. During the course of that research, she was kidnapped by the duplicitous [[Chief Navigator]] [[Peita Aabe]] as part of a plot against her father. She was quickly rescued by Solo, foiling the plot and enabling her to help them finally find Sekot's location. Fel continued life in the Unknown Regions after that, becoming the only surviving Fel daughter and one of only three living Fel children by [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]], with [[Chak Fel|Chak]], [[Davin Fel|Davin]], and [[Cherith Fel|Cherith]] [[Death/Legends|dead]] and only herself, [[Jagged Fel|Jagged]], and [[Cem Fel|Cem]] alive.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\n{{Quote|I think I'd like to go there someday.

Soontir was a former [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Starfighter/Legends|fighter]] [[Ace/Legends|ace]], and Syal a former actress under the stage name Wynssa Starflare, which gave Wynssa Fel her name.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /><ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> Soontir and Syal had moved to [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]] in the Unknown Regions in [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]] in order to serve [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo's]] [[Empire of the Hand]], battling various threats to [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] civilization and the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]], Thrawn's home society.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> Fel, raised on Nirauan, had four older siblings: brothers [[Chak Fel|Chak]], [[Davin Fel|Davin]], and [[Jagged Fel|Jagged]] as well as sister [[Cherith Fel|Cherith]]. Her brother, [[Cem Fel|Cem]], was the family's [[shadow child]], raised in complete secrecy in order to secure the future of the family line in the event of attack by rivals, a [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] custom.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\">''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''</ref>\n\nAll her older siblings went into the military, leaving Fel at home with Cem. Among the militaristic Imperials and Chiss, Fel developed a military outlook herself, seeing battle against threats to peace as a duty. Fel was taught to [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], presumably by her father, and liked to take out the family [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] ''[[Starflare]]'', though Cem was frequently at the controls.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> Fel suffered the loss of her siblings early in her life, with Davin dying by [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]] and Cherith by [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]].<ref name=\"Ruin\" /><ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\">{{GamerCite|7|Red Sky, Blue Flame}}</ref> In 25 ABY, Jagged was sent back to the known regions of the galaxy to aid the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] in the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]].<ref name=\"Ruin\" /> Through it all, Fel remained at home with her mother and Cem, and by [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]] the Empire of the Hand had ceased to exist as a unit, with the Fels joining the Chiss Ascendancy. Fel and her family moved to [[Csilla/Legends|Csilla]], the Chiss capital, and continued life there. Fel spent much time in the [[Expeditionary Library]], becoming familiar with much of the material stored therein.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\n===Kidnapping===\n{{Quote|I want your cooperation. And I will get it, too, because we have your daughter.|[[Ina'ganet'nuruodo]], to Soontir Fel|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\nIn 28 ABY, Fel and her mother heard that an expedition from the known galaxy had arrived at the Expeditionary Library. They traveled there and encountered [[Saba Sebatyne]] and [[Danni Quee]], representatives of a [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] mission seeking [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]], which they felt could be key to winning the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. Her mother was briefly embarrassed by Fel's impertinence in asking Sebatyne questions and remarking on her [[Species/Legends|species]] traits, but Fel was then embarrassed by Syal's outburst against the mission. Syal feared the Jedi in fact wished to push the Chiss into the Yuuzhan Vong War and risk Soontir's life as Jagged's was being risked. Sebatyne explained that that was not their mission, but also that one way or the other, conflict with the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] would come. Fighting them in unity would better everyone's chances. This was in fact the way Fel felt about the situation. Fel volunteered to stay behind and aid the party in their search for information, which Syal allowed her to do.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nShe was joined in the search for information by [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], with whom she was somewhat taken. She asked him many questions about his life and pressed him on his pacifistic philosophy. She was left with only Solo and Commander [[Hess'irolia'nuruodo]] when the other members of the party left to move [[Jade Shadow|their ship]].<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> During their conversation, Fel mentioned Cem, information that eventually worked its way back to the Chiss in [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]], when [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] mentioned the name to Chiss [[Aristocra/Legends|Aristocra]] [[Chaf'orm'bintrano]]; Formbi, however, was convinced that Fel was acting on her father's orders in leaking the information.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /><ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\n[[File:Jacen2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Fel's rescuer, Jacen Solo.]]\n\nDuring her time in the library, her father's subordinate, [[Chief Navigator]] [[Peita Aabe]], entered the library and summoned her to come with him on the orders of her father. She complied, but became increasingly suspicious and fearful that something was wrong. Traveling through the corridors, she wanted to know why Aabe was transporting her through the [[iceway]]s rather than by [[ice-barge]]. Once they reached the iceway terminus, Fel demanded that Aabe contact her father and prove his orders. Aabe drew his weapon on her, causing Solo and Irolia, who had also been suspicious and followed, to intervene. Solo disarmed Aabe and subdued him, with Fel taking his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. Her father and the rest of the party had likewise come under attack by Soontir's political enemies, but that attack had been stopped as well. Fel was left very impressed by Solo's rescue. They returned to the library, where Fel helped run the search that found Zonama Sekot's likely location, sending the team off in search of it.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\n===Later life===\n{{Quote|Only two survived. Jagged and Wyn. Chak, Davin, and Cherith are all dead.|Chaf'orm'bintrano, to Luke Skywalker|Dark Nest I: The Joiner King}}\nWith the conclusion of the war in [[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]], Fel was able to celebrate Jagged's return to Csilla, first as a liaison with the Galactic Alliance and then as an officer in the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]], but this was counterbalanced by Fel's loss of her brother Chak, the third Fel to [[Death/Legends|die]].<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /><ref name=\"The Unifying Force\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref> In [[36 ABY]], the Fels were dishonored and diminished in power by the actions of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Lowbacca]], taken after Jagged granted his parole as an officer of the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]]; at the same time, Jagged was himself lost to a crash on [[Tenupe]].<ref name=\"The Swarm War\">''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]''</ref> While Jagged was recovered two years later, he was [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]], never to be able to return.<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref> It was only in [[40 ABY]], with the death of the Chiss enemy [[Alema Rar]] at Jagged's hands that the family's honor was restored.<ref name=\"Fury\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Sometimes I think that the sooner we can be rid of the Yuuzhan Vong, the better.
