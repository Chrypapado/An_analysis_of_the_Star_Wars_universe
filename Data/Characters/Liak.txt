For some reason it works on space stations as well. We don't understand it, but we don't argue with it.|Melenna Seltrayne, on Liak and Wookiees|Do No Harm}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] from [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], '''Liak''' joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] when his friend and [[Hunting/Legends|hunting]] partner [[Zherriak]] was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] raid of their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. Small for his [[Species/Legends|species]], he became a member of [[Koris Haslam]]'s [[Commando/Legends|commando]] team and participated in several missions for the Alliance. Because of his intricate knowledge of jungles and his instinctive sense of direction, which could be applied to [[Space station/Legends|space stations]] and other compounds, he was selected to participate in the [[Mission to Selnesh|rescue]] of Rebel leader [[Gebnerret Vibrion]] from an Imperial [[Selnesh Imperial Detention Center|prison]] on [[Selnesh/Legends|Selnesh]]. During the mission, he acted as a [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] accused of [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] and of Rebel sympathies, and he helped his team escape through the prison's underground tunnels.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|We infiltrate the center incognito&mdash;Melenna, Liak, you're the prisoners; standard-smugglers-suspected-of-rebel-sympathies scenario.|Koris Haslam|Do No Harm}}\nThe [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] Liak grew up on the [[Tree/Legends|forest]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], where he lived in the jungle's upper levels. He became good friends with the Wookiee [[Zherriak]], with whom he swore an honor bond, and the two frequently [[Hunting/Legends|hunted]] together.<ref name=\"DNH\" />\n\nWhen Liak was about middle-aged<ref name=\"DNH\" />&mdash;between 301 and 350 [[Standard year/Legends|standard years]] by his [[Species/Legends|species's]] standards<ref name=\"UAA\">''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''</ref>&mdash;the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]],<ref name=\"DNH\" /> the dominant [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government at the [[Time/Legends|time]],<ref name=\"Atlas\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> came to Kashyyyk on a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] raid. Zherriak was [[Death/Legends|killed]], and Liak and several other Wookiees were taken captive. However, before they could be forced into slavery, the surviving Wookiees overpowered the Imperials and captured their [[Starship/Legends|starship]]. Most of the survivors returned to Kashyyyk to resume their lives, but Liak, determined to take revenge on those who had killed his friend, turned to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]].<ref name=\"DNH\" />\n\nLiak became a [[Commando/Legends|commando]] and undertook several undercover missions during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] in a team [[Commander/Legends|commanded]] by the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Koris Haslam]]. Along with other commandos&mdash;the Humans [[Melenna Seltrayne]], [[Barsoulentinial Enkhet]], [[Gowan Ch'lessan]], and [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Aurin Leith]]&mdash;Liak was later selected to take part in a [[Mission to Selnesh|mission]] to rescue Rebel leader [[Gebnerret Vibrion]] from Imperial custody on the planet [[Selnesh/Legends|Selnesh]]. Vibrion, an elderly Human with [[Zithrom's syndrome]]&mdash;a [[Kidney/Legends|kidney]] disorder that was treated through consistent doses of the medicine [[Clondex]]&mdash;had knowledge of critical information that could mean disaster for the Alliance should it be extracted by the Imperials. To infiltrate the [[Selnesh Imperial Detention Center]], in which Vibrion was being held, Ch'lessan and Enkhet disguised themselves as Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], while Liak and Seltrayne played the part of captured [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] with suspected ties to the Rebellion. Doctor Leith was to assume the role of an ignorant passenger taking transit to the planet [[Sestooine]] with the two smugglers. Liak's sense of direction was called upon for the mission, as his instinctive ability to navigate through the jungles of his homeworld also applied to the complex corridors of [[Space station/Legends|space stations]] and other structures, a trait that his comrades found mysterious.<ref name=\"DNH\" />\n\n[[File:Aurin_and_Vibrion_SWAJ10.jpg|thumb|left|Aurin Leith and Melenna Seltrayne, two of Liak's companions during the mission to Selnesh, aid a recovering Gebnerret Vibrion.]]\nAfter four days in [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], the group reached Selnesh, and Liak, Seltrayne, and Leith were put in [[Stun cuffs|binder cuffs]] before their ship landed in a [[Hangar/Legends|docking bay]] in the Imperial [[Prison/Legends|prison]]. Once the group was inside the prison's central [[Computer/Legends|computer]] bank, Halsam, impersonating an [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]], ushered out the Imperials on duty under the pretense that he needed to interrogate the smugglers. When the Imperials left, the binders were removed, and the team located Vibrion's cell. Liak, prepared to help in any way necessary, stayed at Leith's side while she gave Vibrion several doses of revitalizing drugs and Clondex. However, when Haslam grew worried that the Imperials were beginning to suspect that something was amiss, he ordered Liak to open the door to the access tunnel through which the group planned to escape. Once the door was open and Vibrion was able to walk, Liak led the team toward the docking bay. Before they could make it into the bay, however, a [[Lightfight|firefight]] broke out with a group of Imperial stormtroopers that had followed the Rebels into the tunnel. While his companions defended against the Imperials behind them, Liak threw a [[Concussion grenade/Legends|concussion grenade]] into the bay, killing several Imperial [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]]. The team ran to the ship and subsequently escaped the planet with no casualties.<ref name=\"DNH\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nLiak, whose name meant \"[[Autumn/Legends|autumn]],\" \"[[Blood/Legends|blood]],\" or \"[[Color/Legends|red]]\" in [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]],<ref name=\"Callsigns\">{{GamerCite|10|Callsigns: Names of Kashyyyk}}</ref> was slightly smaller than most Wookiees, who were between two and 2.3 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] as adults.<ref name=\"UAA\" /> However, Liak was not short enough to stand fully upright in the Selnesh detention center's underground tunnels. He had pale blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and a long coat of golden-brown [[Hair/Legends|fur]],<ref name=\"DNH\" /> and, like most Wookiees,<ref name=\"NEGAS\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Alien Species]]''</ref> Liak had a strong code of honor and justice; he swore vengeance on the Galactic Empire after they killed his friend Zherriak and enslaved his people. Despite this, Liak was calm and rational, and he became an invaluable member of Koris Haslam's commando team as the voice of reason. Frequently, Halsam and Seltrayne squabbled amongst themselves, and Liak had to gently but firmly remind the two of the task at [[Limb/Legends|hand]]. He was able to discern the anxiety of others, and he attempted to calm his teammates when they became emotional. When Doctor Leith became nervous during the rescue operation, which was her first mission, Liak offered her calming words, and, although the doctor could not comprehend Liak's Wookiee [[Language/Legends|language]], she understood that he was trying to reassure her.<ref name=\"DNH\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nThough gentle by nature, Liak was a cunning warrior with a mind honed for perception and survival. He was skilled in many areas of war, including [[Unarmed combat|hand-to-hand combat]], though by Wookiee honor he was forbidden to use his climbing claws in battle. He was also very knowledgeable, having an understanding of the operation and repair of many vehicles, including [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] vehicles and starships. Raised on the upper levels of Kashyyyk, Liak developed an intimate understanding of the planet's complex jungles and honed his instinctive sense of direction, which he put to use many times in the service of the Rebellion. He was skilled in the use of [[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcasters]] and grenades, both of which he carried, along with a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], [[Medpac/Legends|medpac]], and ammo bandolier, during his mission to the Selnesh Detention Center for the Rebellion.<ref name=\"DNH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLiak's only appearance to date is in the short story \"[[Do No Harm]],\" written by [[Erin Endom]] and illustrated by [[Chris Trevas|Christopher Trevas]]. \"Do No Harm\" was originally published in [[May (month)|May]] of [[1996]] in [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 10|''Star Wars Adventure Journal'' 10]], which included statistics on several characters, including Liak, for ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]''. The story was later reprinted in the short story anthology ''[[Tales from the Empire]]'' in [[1997]] and archived online on [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] in [[2006]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|10|Do No Harm}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
