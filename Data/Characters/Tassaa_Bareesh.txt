She invited both the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] in order to outbid each other.\n\nAfter a failed attempt, a battle between [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Shigar Konshi]] and [[Sith Acolyte]] [[Eldon Ax]] started. The battle was short until they were both arrested after large parts of the palace were stolen and destroyed by a [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] named [[Dao Stryver]]. Shigar was able to convince them of his innocence, however, he had to sign a contract with the matriarch. According to the agreement, the Padawan would track down the thief and retrieve the navicomputer which was stolen.\n\nThis eventually led the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire to form an alliance together and battle against an army of hex droids on [[Sebaddon]]. However, Shigar's promise to Bareesh was not kept since he failed to retrieve what was stolen. Bareesh had no choice but to drop a bounty on the Padawan.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance]]'' {{1st|''The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance'' audiobook}}\n*[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780307736970.html Random House entry]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tassaa Bareesh\n|es=Tassaa Bareesh\n|ru=\u0422\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0448\n|it=Tassaa Bareesh\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bareesh, Tassaa}}\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hutt Cartel individuals]]\n[[Category:Hutts of the Bareesh clan]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
