''She's'' Chelli Aphra. And she's ''my'' problem.|Ariole Yu and Sana Starros|Doctor Aphra (2020) 14}}\n'''Sana Starros''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] who lived during the time of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. She was once a student at the [[University of Bar'leth]], where she had a romantic relationship with [[Chelli Lona Aphra]]. Later, she claimed to be [[Marriage|married]] to [[Han Solo]], though he denied it, and regardless they were not on good terms in the time after the [[Battle of Yavin]]. She traveled across [[the galaxy]] in search of Han, from [[Tatooine]] to the [[Monsua Nebula]], in order to confront him. She was also captain of the ''[[Volt Cobra]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nSana Starros was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]]<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" /> descendant of the [[High Republic Era]] [[Starros clan]], a group that included her ancestor, the [[scientist]] [[Avon Starros]].<ref name=\"Publishing\">{{Youtube|video=tlshzMnfbiE|text=Lucasfilm Publishing: Stories From a Galaxy Far, Far Away &#124; Comic-Con@Home 2020|channel=UCnKFQ3qLokC-6OS3YHNgGpw|channelname=Comic-Con International|archiveurl=https://archive.is/MSbWI}}</ref> Sana was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[Smuggler]]s [[moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa]] and grew up in [[Wormstew Town]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 34\" /> She claimed to have [[Marriage|married]] the smuggler [[Han Solo]], though he denied she was his wife. The marriage was part of her and Solo's scam in order to pull off a robbery on [[Stenness]]. However, Solo made off with her cut of the robbery.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref> At some point, she came to believe that lying was the only thing that Solo was good for, while Solo saw her as someone dangerous to him, and tried to avoid her.<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" />\n\n====University of Bar'leth====\nStarros was a classmate of [[Chelli Lona Aphra]] at the [[University of Bar'leth]], located on the [[Core Worlds|core world]] of [[Bar'leth]]. Sana and Aphra both attended [[Sava]] [[Toob-Nix]]'s class on archaeology, where Aphra would frequently interrupt Toob-Nix's lectures. One day, Aphra was late to class and snuck in through a window, and interrupted Toob-Nix's assertion that all of the artifacts once stored at the university library on the [[Fifth Moon of Thrinittik]] had been destroyed. Aphra argued that enough of the structure had survived that some of its artifacts might remain buried and preserved, and an archeological expedition could uncover them. The Sava argued that Aphra's ideas were wrong, when Starros spoke up to back Aphra up. Starros pointed out research in the University of Bar'leth library that supported Aphra's claims. Aphra became instantly enamored with Starros.<ref name=\"Aphra Audiobook\">''[[Doctor Aphra: An Audiobook Original]]''</ref>\n\nAphra was certain that Toob-Nix would try to have her expelled, but Sana secretly blackmailed the Sava; warning him that if he expelled Aphra, she would end his career by reporting how he furthered his own academic agenda through teaching his class incorrect information. Aphra was unaware of Starros' blackmailing of the Sava for years thereafter.<ref name=\"Aphra Audiobook\" />\n\nAphra and Starros began dating, and the pair were monogamous&mdash; something unusual for Aphra. However, Aphra eventually ran off without telling Starros goodbye, ending the relationship on very bad terms.<ref name=\"Aphra Audiobook\" />\n\n====Securing the Phylanx Redux Transmitter====\nAt one point, Starros attended the [[Auction on Cantonica|auction]] of the [[Phylanx Redux Transmitter]] and barely escaped with her life after a disgruntled suitor opened fire when [[Crimson Dawn]] won the bid for the Phylanx. She was then hired to pretend she had the Phylanx to attract and eliminate those who pursued the Phylanx.<ref name=\"Last Shot\" /> Around [[3 BBY]],{{Fact}} Starros traveled to the [[planet]] [[Takodana]] and kidnapped the leader of the [[Parapa Cartel]], [[Mozeen Parapa]], in order to gain his intel on the Phylanx. Starros then encountered Solo and his companion [[Chewbacca]] in a landing field outside of [[Takodana Castle]] and offered them fifty percent of her cut in exchange for their help. However, Starros discovered she was being pursued by bounty hunters, who chased Starros, Solo, Chewbacca, and Parapa into the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Despite Solo's reluctance to accept help from the rude Parapa, Starros agreed to let Parapa go and give him seven percent of the cut in return for his help.<ref name=\"Last Shot\" />\n\nStarros directed them to [[Freerago's Satellite Diner and Motel]], where she returned Parapa to his henchmen when Parapa told him that the Phylanx was in possession of the [[Pau'an]] [[Fyzen Gor]]. Starros stayed with the ''Millennium Falcon'' while Solo and Chewbacca entered the diner and discovered Gor and claimed the Phylanx from him. However, when Starros picked them up, they were boarded by [[Gorben Frak]] and a group of [[bounty hunter]]s hired by the [[Droid Gotra]] as well as the Parapa Cartel. Starros paid the Parapa Cartel, but when threatened to turn over the Phylanx to the Gotra, she told Solo to shoot the prize out of the airlock instead, hoping to successfully scare them with the bluff. However, a confused Solo dumped the Phylanx, thinking Starros was serious. When the hunters left to find it, Starros was furious with Solo. She told them to drop her off back on Takodana, telling them she should never have hired them.<ref name=\"Last Shot\" />\n\n===Hunting Solo===\n{{Quote|I figured talk of a reward would bring the biggest thieves and cutthroats in town slithering out of their holes. And thieves and cutthroats are exactly what I need. I'm looking for the biggest one of them all. A smuggler. By the name of ''Solo''.|Sana Starros|Star Wars (2015) 4}}\nAround the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Yavin]], when Solo joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]],<ref name=\"Episode IV\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> Sana set out to find him.<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" />\n[[File:Sana_Solo_shoots_Rodians.png|thumb|left|300px|Sana's voice-activated smart-targeting scatterblasters shoot Rodian criminals in Mos Eisley.]]\nSana's search for Solo led her to the [[desert]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]], where Solo and his [[Starship|ship]], the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', had been shortly before the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]]. Starros put out the word that she was looking for someone, that person being Solo, and that she was offering a reward to whoever could help her find her supposed husband. A group of armed [[Rodian]]s confronted Starros in the [[spaceport]] settlement of [[Mos Eisley]], demanding to be given the reward [[Currency|money]] despite not being willing to help her on her mission. Starros used voice-activated smart-targeting [[scatterblaster]]s from Nar Shaddaa that she had hidden under the table she was sitting at to shoot all four of the Rodians in the knees, and she threatened to shoot them in their faces if they did not provide her with information about Solo's whereabouts. The lead Rodian relented and told Starros that Solo had left Tatooine after [[Death|killing]] [[Greedo]], a fellow Rodian.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\nSoon thereafter, Starros picked up Solos location and followed him into the [[Moddell sector]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]]. Solo, who was accompanied by [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] aboard the ''[[Invictus]]'', a stolen [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]], fled from pursuing [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter]]s towards a [[Unidentified planet (Monsua Nebula)|planet]] in the [[Monsua Nebula]], where the [[TIE line|TIE fighters]] would not pursue due to dangerous electrical storms in the [[atmosphere]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\">[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]</ref> Sana arrived at the [[nebula]] and flew past the TIE fighters, the [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|pilots]] of which were unwilling to pursue her or the ''Invictus'' onto the surface of the planet. Starros landed her [[Volt Cobra|ship]] near where Solo was located, and the smuggler was displeased to see her. Organa asked who she was, and she introduced herself as Solo's wife&mdash;though he denied it&mdash;and demanded to know who the princess was.<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" />\n\nDuring a brief exchange, in which Starros slapped Solo for tasting like the [[Corellian wine]] that Organa had splashed in his face earlier, she revealed that the planet they were on was once a favored rendezvous point for the couple. Organa, announcing that this whole affair was none of her business, attempted to leave but after Solo called out for her to stay, Starros realized the princess' importance, citing the large [[bounty]] on her head. It was at this point that the Imperials, who had sent an [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] into the nebula, caught up with the fugitives. Several TIE fighters and [[TIE/sa bomber]]s began a bombardment of the surface, dropping [[proton bomb]]s through the electrical storms below. Realizing an opportunity, Starros ordered her associate Cobra to [[fire]] on the stolen [[shuttle]], destroying Solo and Organa's only means of escape. She then announced her intention to turn Organa over to the Imperials and bring Solo back with her. She attempted to make contact with the [[Star Destroyer]] in [[orbit]] but was interrupted when Organa kicked Solo into her and drew a weapon of her own. However, it was too late as the TIEs were already descending on their position.<ref name=\"Star Wars 8\">[[Star Wars (2015) 8|''Star Wars'' (2015) 8]]</ref>\n\nAfter the TIE fighters landed, the [[pilot]]s got out of their craft and attempted to apprehend Organa, but she opened fire and killed two of the pilots. Solo convinced Starros not to collect Organa's bounty by explaining that he was part of the Rebel Alliance as well, and that he would likely be executed or [[Prison|imprisoned]] as well. Solo shot the last remaining TIE pilot, and the trio boarded the ''Volt Cobra''. More TIEs appeared re-engaging the ''Volt Cobra'', and jammed its transmissions.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref> The ''Volt Cobra'' came under attack by a Star Destroyer. Starros piloted the ''Volt Cobra'' and plotted a course before entering [[hyperspace]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref>\n\n===Rescuing Skywalker===\nAfter losing the Imperials, Starros told Solo that their marriage did happen on [[Stenness]]. Starros was told by Organa to set a course for Nar Shaddaa to [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|rescue]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. Starros, not wanting to join the rebellion, refused until Organa offered to pay her for her help. However all Starros wanted was her husband, to which Organa agreed. Starros set a course of Nar Shaddaa.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" /> Upon the ''Volt Cobra''{{'s}} arrival on Nar Shaddaa,<ref name=\"Star Wars 11\">[[Star Wars (2015) 11|''Star Wars'' (2015) 11]]</ref> Starros went with Solo and Organa. Along with [[Chewbacca]], Starros helped them infiltrate the [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|Palace]] of [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the [[Hutt]]. However, when they got to the Palace's arena, all their [[blaster]]s did not work and Starros was buried under rock. She was freed by Organa and revealed that she was not actually Solo's wife. Starros told her of the robbery in which she and Solo pretended to be married. Starros agreed to just be paid as long as Solo was not killed before that time. Starros later left Nar Shaddaa aboard the ''Volt Cobra'' alongside the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" />\n\n===Working for the Alliance===\n====Sunspot Prison====\nStarros was then hired to assist Organa in dropping [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]] off at the Alliance's [[Sunspot Prison]]. Enroute to the prison, Aphra attempted to escape her captors aboard the ''Volt Cobra'', but Starros was able to knock her out. She, Organa, [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] took Aphra into the prison. After Aphra's interrogation, Starros questioned the [[Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service]]'s effectiveness compared with the Empire's. Starros said if they could not get the answers out of Aphra, she would throw her into [[Realspace|space]]. After Organa left, Starros told Aphra that she wanted her to be killed. She also refused to let Aphra talk her in too letting her out. Aphra called her Starros a rebel sympathizer and said she hated smugglers. As Starros and Organa spoke with the [[warden]], the prison came under [[Assault on Sunspot Prison|attack]] by several [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].<ref name=\"SW16\" />\n\nStarros, Organa, and the guards took out several [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|IG-RM droids]]. As they regrouped, Starros and Organa discovered that the mercenary in charge had taken the prison's control room. She and Organa watched as the mercenary ordered the deaths of several [[prisoner]]s. Despite Starros agreeing with the mercenary, she went with Organa. Along the way, Starros and Organa came under attack by [[Kolar Ludd]]. She and Organa took Ludd back to the guards and the other prisoners. After the mercenary killed several more prisoners, Starros and Organa saved Aphra from a IG-RM [[droid]]. Despite their mutual hostility, Starros and Organa gave Aphra a gun since they faced an [[Eneb Ray|enemy]], who was determined to kill all the Imperial prisoners aboard the station.<ref name=\"SW17\">[[Star Wars (2015) 17|''Star Wars'' (2015) 17]]</ref>\n\nWhile navigating through Sunspot's cell blocks, Starros attempted to send a [[distress signal]] but was attacked by an IG-RM droid, which grabbed her neck. Instead of attacking the droid, Aphra tried to reprogram the droid. Organa shot the droid and stopped Starros from attacking Aphra. When Organa asked if Starros was able to get the signal through, she replied that she did not managed to reach the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] but hoped that someone in the area would pick it up. Starros threatened to throw her estranged friend Aphra into the sun but Organa warned them that they needed to pull their resources into fighting against a common enemy.<ref name=\"SW18\">[[Star Wars (2015) 18|''Star Wars'' (2015) 18]]</ref>\n\nThey reached another cell block only to discover too later that the intruder had ejected the prisoners into the [[Star|sun]]. With the help of C-3PO and R2-D2 and one of Aphra's reprogrammed IG-RM droids, Starros and the other women managed to retake the control room. While Organa interrogated one of the enemy droids, Starros and Aphra argued. Still bitter about Aphra's betrayal, Starros told Aphra to move over. Aphra told her to get over what had happened a \"long time ago\" and told Starros to get over her crush. Starros countered by telling Aphra to learn how to stab people in the front for a change. Organa broke the argument since she had received a [[comlink]] message from Solo and Skywalker.<ref name=\"SW18\" />\n\n====Parting with Doctor Aphra====\nStarros along with Organa and Aphra entered the [[hangar]] bay only to discover that the lead intruder had taken Solo and Skywalker captive. The intruder revealed himself as Eneb Ray, a former rebel [[agent]] who had been radicalized by the failed [[Arrth-Eno Mission]]. Ray now lived to seek revenge against the Empire by any means necessary including murder. Seeking to win Organa over to his cause, he demanded that she execute Aphra in return for sparing the lives of her friends. While Organa refused to abandon her principles, a vindictive Starros pointed her gun at Aphra's head. Despite Organa and Aphra's pleas, Starros proceeded to aim her blaster at Aphra's head. However, Organa convinced R2-D2 to ignite the ion pulse, disabling the station's power and [[artificial gravity]].<ref name=\"SW19\">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref>\n\nAmidst the chaos, Starros and Aphra fought with the former gaining the upper hand. As Starros proceed to choke Aphra, the latter apologized for betraying her. Still angry with Aphra, Starros flung her against Ray. Abandoning their differences, the three women then overpowered and disarmed the rogue rebel agent. After [[Alliance Military|Rebel Alliance forces]] retook the prison and proceeded to evacuate the surviving prisoners, Aphra took the opportunity to escape. Organa caught up with her and tried to convince her that [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] was untrustworthy. Before the conversation could continue, Starros shoved Aphra into the [[escape pod]] and told her never to return.<ref name=\"SW19\" />\n\nThrough her actions, Starros had helped her estranged friend Aphra escape rebel custody. When Organa asked how long it would take for her to find all the trackers they had hidden in her clothes, Starros responded that Aphra had hidden trackers aboard their ship '' Volt Cobra''. When Organa asked about her connection with Aphra, Starros refused to talk about it. After chatting about Starros's fees, Organa teased Solo and Skywalker about them being terrible rescuers. While boarding the ''Millennium Falcon'', she noticed that the ship smelled like a herd of [[nerf]]s.<ref name=\"SW19\" />\n\n====Hijacking the ''Harbinger''====\nStarros later went with Solo and Organa when the Rebel Alliance decided to [[Hijacking of the Harbinger|take control]] of the Star Destroyer [[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|''Harbinger'']] in order to [[Siege on Tureen VII|break]] through the [[blockade]] at [[Tureen VII]]. After the ''Falcon'' landed aboard the ''Harbinger'', Starros guarded the ship as Solo and Organa made their way to the [[reactor]] room. Starros met up with Solo, Organa, Skywalker and their team on the ''Harbinger''{{'s}} [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 22\">[[Star Wars (2015) 22|''Star Wars'' (2015) 22]]</ref> Starros told 3PO and R2 that she could see that Solo and Organa, despite their bickering, were falling in love each other. She went with Skywalker and the two of them flew TIE fighters to rendezvous with [[Admiral]] [[Verette]]'s shuttle. However, they found the ship and the Admiral's body. Starros then destroyed the shuttle and told Skywalker that the shuttle was either a warning or distraction.<ref name=\"Star Wars 23\">[[Star Wars (2015) 23|''Star Wars'' (2015) 23]]</ref>\n\nStarros, Skywalker and their group went to check on the maintenance team. Starros found blaster marks but no bodies of the maintenance team were found. Starros, Skywalker, and their team then lost contact with Solo and Organa on the bridge. The doors were closed behind them and Skywalker was knocked out. Starros and the group then came under attack by several [[Special Commando Advanced Recon Trooper|SCAR]] [[trooper]]s of [[Task Force 99|SCAR Squadron]]. She and her team were pinned down by the stormtroopers but Sana was later contacted by the bridge.<ref name=\"Star Wars 24\">[[Star Wars (2015) 24|''Star Wars'' (2015) 24]]</ref> Starros knocked out several stormtroopers until she was held at gunpoint by one after jettisoning the escape pods. However, Starros was able to escape the trooper after she activated a hangar door. Starros was saved by Skywalker.<ref name=\"Star Wars 25\">[[Star Wars (2015) 25|''Star Wars'' (2015) 25]]</ref>\n\n====Journey to Ktath'atn====\nStarros continued working with Solo and Organa at the [[Horox III rebel outpost|rebel outpost]] on [[Horox III]]. There, she received a message from Aphra. Starros helped Organa with [[S4]] in making the droid reveal Skywalker's location, that he had gone with Aphra and the droid was re-programmed by her.<ref name=\"Screaming Citadel 1\">[[The Screaming Citadel 1|''The Screaming Citadel'' 1]]</ref> Starros told Solo that Aphra was taking Skywalker to [[Ktath'atn]] to meet with the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen]]. Starros, Organa and Solo decided to go to Ktath'atn to [[Mission to Ktath'atn|rescue]] him. Starros refused to talk about her relationship with Aphra with Solo or Organa. Upon their arrival on Ktath'atn, Starros, Organa and Solo met up with Aphra's droids, [[BT-1]] and [[0-0-0]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 31\">[[Star Wars (2015) 31|''Star Wars'' (2015) 31]]</ref>\n\nStarros met up with Aphra and tried to kill her. However, Skywalker deflected the blast away from Aphra and refused to let Starros kill her. Starros and the others fought the Queen's [[Queen of Ktath'atn's hive|forces]] and retreated to the [[Citadel of Ktath'atn]]'s control room. There, she found several [[Abersyn symbiote]]s. When Aphra made a deal with the queen to reactivate the [[Rur crystal]], Starros told Organa that they should have killed her. She engaged in a firefight between the Queen's guards until Solo was taken over by her. Organa and Starros met up with S4, BT-1 and 0-0-0 in the Citadel's command center. After, BT blew a hole in the wall, Starros and Organa saw [[Bombinax]] standing over [[Black Krrsantan]] before the two were confronted by Bombinax. Starros later helped Krrsantan aboard his ship.<ref name=\"Dr. Aphra 7\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>\n\nStarros and Organa watched as Krrsantan threw Bombinax over a cliff. Starros said they would fight the queen with Krrsantan, BT-1 and 0-0-0. Starros worked with the droids in fighting the guards. She knocked Solo and stopped him from implanting a symbiote in Organa.<ref name=\"Star Wars 32\">[[Star Wars (2015) 32|''Star Wars'' (2015) 32]]</ref> Starros and Organa continued to fight the guards and were able to get through to Solo. As they were outfought, Starros and Organa took several of the Queen's leaders. Starros saw that the Queen's guards were following Solo and asked him if wanted to be a [[king]]. After Solo said no, Starros saw that the guards and the people had been freed. After meeting up with Skywalker, Starros said her goodbyes to Aphra. Starros piloted the ''Falcon'' away from Ktath'atn.<ref name=\"Dr. Aphra 8\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 8|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 8]]</ref>\n\n===Working with Calrissian===\n{{Quote|Remind me never to play Sabacc against you, lady.|Lando Calrissian|Star Wars (2015) 34}}\n[[File:CalrissianStarrosCoruscant-SW2015-33.jpg|thumb|right|Starros meets with Calrissian]]\nSome time following the events on Ktath'atn, Starros met up with a group of [[Krawg pirates]] in the Outer Rim. There, Starros offered the pirates 13 crates of [[E-11 blaster rifle]] for a 5000 [[credit]] downpayment and then asked for 15000 credits for the rest of the crates. However, she kept one of the blasters with her and was warned by the pirates that they would cut her up. The pirates agreed and paid her the 5000. Starros then met up with [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] on [[Coruscant]]. There, she told Calrissian about her deal with the pirates. Starros told Calrissian that she would sell the crates to the pirates, then she would sell them out to the Empire and collect the rewards on the pirates. In addition, she would keep the blasters.<ref name=\"Star Wars 34\" />\n\nStarros and Calrissian went to meet with an [[Imperial officer]], where she confessed to stealing the blaster. She haggled with the [[officer]] offering the names of the pirates and blasters for 20000 credits. At first, the officer refused and threatened to shoot Calrissian. Starros continued to ask for the price and left it up to the officer. The officer agreed and let them go. Starros and Calrissian continued with their deal, but Starros revealed that [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] had the 12 other crates. The two of them went to Tatooine to meet meet with Jabba at his [[Jabba's Palace|Palace]]. Despite Jabba denying his possession of the crates, Starros offered to give name of the pirates in exchange for 20000. One of he pirates attempted to shoot her, but Starros was able to shoot first. Jabba agreed to her price.<ref name=\"Star Wars 34\" />\n\nAs Starros and Calrissian left Tatooine, she told him about Jabba got the blasters and how she stole the first crate. Starros said she stole the rest of the crates while Calrissian was drinking with Jabba. Starros agreed to drop Calrissian off anywhere he wanted, but he demanded his finder's fee. The ''Volt Cobra'' then came under attack by the pirates. However, a Star Destroyer arrived and captured the pirates ship. Starros and Calrissian made their escape to Nar Shaddaa. There, she and Calrissian had dinner, but he did not like the food and decided to leave with his cut. After he left, Starros ordered some more appetizing food from the [[waiter]], [[Gru (waiter)|Gru]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 34\" />\n\nShortly after, Starros met up with Solo, Organa, Skywalker and the ''Falcon'' at the Horox III rebel outpost, which had been [[Mission to Horox III|attacked]] and destroyed by Imperials. She told the princess they should leave right away, knowing the bodies would be booby-trapped. They rounded up the dead rebels anyway and Starros found a message from the attackers, who revealed themselves to be SCAR [[Squadron]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 37\">[[Star Wars (2015) 37|''Star Wars'' (2015) 37]]</ref>\n\n===Hunting Aphra===\n[[File:ThirdMoon.png|thumb|left|250px|Starros is hired to rescue Aphra]]\nSometime later, Starros was on the [[3rd Moon]] when she was contacted by rebel General [[Hera Syndulla]], who had a job for her. She required Starros to rescue Aphra from the Imperial [[wreckage-prison]] [[Accresker Jail]] in order to get intel from her that the rebels needed. Starros agreed to do it and took wasted no time tracking the prison. She found Accresker Jail in [[Senex-Juvex]], where it was preparing to [[Attack on a pirate station|deploy]] its prisoners into a [[Unidentified pirate station|pirate station]]. While she waited for the battle to begin she talked to Syndulla, who was intrigued to know why she hated Aphra so much. Starros filled the time by explaining her hate for Aphra to Syndulla through a hard-bitten analogy. By the time she had finished, the battle was beginning.<ref name=\"Aphra 21\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 21|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 21]]</ref>\n\nStarros flew the ''Volt Cobra'' towards Accresker Jail in search of Aphra. As it happened, Aphra was trying to escape with the help of her crush, the Imperial [[Captain-Inspector]] [[Magna Tolvan]].<ref name=\"Aphra 21\" /> When Starros found them, she assumed Tolvan, who was flying a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]], intended to kill Aphra and shot at her. Tolvan then jumped out of the exploding TIE with a [[Missile launcher|rocket launcher]] and shot at the ''Volt Cobra'', tearing through the port side and forcing it to crash land. Both now without their ships Starros and Tolvan shot at each other until they both realized they were both trying to save Aphra. Aphra arrived to find the pair were grounded and an Imperial [[hubdroid]] approached them to receive their weapons, with the attack on the pirate station having finished. The hubdroid then took Aphra away, leaving Starros and Tolvan with her [[Changeling|shape-shifting]] [[alien]] friend \"[[Lopset Yas]]\".<ref name=\"Aphra 22\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 22|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 22]]</ref>\n\nStarros, Tolvan and Yas followed the other prisoner as they trickled back from the battle. After, Yas gave the pair prison clothing to blend in along with advice for them. However, they were soon interrupted by an announcement. Aphra, who had been taken by the hubdroid to an interrogation, had revealed the existence of some highly contagious [[Force-sensitive]] [[gundravian hookspore]]s. As a result, [[Accresker command]] decided to decommission the prison and propel it into the rebel sympathizing planet<ref name=\"Aphra 22\" /> [[Tiferep Major]].<ref name=\"Aphra 23\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 23|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 23]]</ref> They told this to the prisoners and released Aphra back to them.<ref name=\"Aphra 22\" />\n\n===Chaos at Tiferep Major===\nDesperate more than ever to escape, Aphra contacted the vigilante [[Tam Posla]], who she had a rough history with. She used Yas' shape-shifting abilities to turn into Posla's most hated individual, [[Cornelius Evazan]]. This convinced Posla to come for them with [[Unidentified shuttle (Tam Posla)|a]] [[shuttle]] to trade for his nemesis. After contacting Posla, Starros, Aphra, Yas, and Tolvan realized that the jail's staff were abandoning the prisons [[Prison-tug|tug-cruiser]], leaving it to fall into Accresker Jail. Together, they evaded the crash and found the other prisoners rioting. The convicts noticed who Aphra was and surrounded them, only to be attacked by a large [[Force spirit]] generated by the Force-sensitive hookspores. Tolvan asked about boarding the wrecked tug-[[cruiser]], so Starros had the others lug a large gun to blow a hole in the side.<ref name=\"Aphra 23\" />\n\nInside the cruiser, the group found the control room and Aphra discovered there was one escape pod left. Starros pointed out they could not use it due to the prisons [[gravity]] field. However, she Aphra realized that she could slice it to be toned down, as well as opening the bulkheads between them and the escape pod. After she opened the bulkheads and rearranged the wreckage-prison by toning down the gravity field strength, she led Starros and the others towards the escape pod. In their way, stood the hookspores which briefly possessed them with the spirit of the deceased [[Unidentified Jedi (Accresker Jail)|Jedi's]] consciousness that made it Force-sensitive. Before it deemed them useless to her, Starros believed she saw [[Sana Starros's brother|her brother]]. She then realized that Aphra was after the [[Jedi]]'s [[lightsaber]] aboard his [[Penumbra-1 shattersprite|ship]]. Starros and Tolvan prompted her to continue to the escape pod.<ref name=\"Aphra 23\" />\n\nAfter arriving at the escape pod, Aphra let Tolvan and Starros get in first. She then tried to jettison them in it together but Tolvan jumped out in time, leaving Starros in the escape pod as it shot out towards Tiferep Major.<ref name=\"Aphra 24\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 24|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 24]]</ref> On the planet, Starros assisted the evacuation of the population while Accresker Jail descended on it. Luckily for her and the forces sent by Syndulla [[starfighter]]s, the prison had been halted in mid air by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], who had been contacted by Tolvan as a last resort. Starros and the [[starfighter]]s Syndulla sent, flew over Accresker Jail and destroyed Vader's shuttle. Vader then destroyed the [[X-wing starfighter|X-wing]] flown by [[Tan Leader]] with [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|his lightsaber]]. While Vader left the scene to deal with the hookspore, Starros and several rebels landed and found Tolvan in the wreckage of his shuttle. With Vader leaving and allowing the prison to fall again, Starros decided to give up finding Aphra and escaped with Tolvan.<ref name=\"Aphra 25\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 25|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 25]]</ref>\n\n===Smuggling the Rebels===\nSometime later, Starros met up with Solo, Organa, Skywalker and their droids on Nar Shaddaa. There, Solo gave her data he retrieved from the [[Ring of Kafrene]]. In exchange, she was asked to help find the both the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] and the ''Millennium Falcon'', which they had been parted from during their [[Assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks|defeat]] at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 55\">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref> At the planet [[Barnahof]], Starros was able to hide Solo and the others from the stormtroopers stationed there. She helped make contact with the [[Information broker|informant]] [[Bodo Linx]], who knew [[Qensog|someone]] on [[Brentaal IV]] who could help them contact the Alliance. Starros then took them to the [[Dene Gois Cluster]] in order to avoid Imperial Interdictors and major [[Hyperspace route|hyperspace lanes]] that lead to Brentaal IV.<ref name=\"Star Wars 56\">[[Star Wars (2015) 56|''Star Wars'' (2015) 56]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Prisoner_Starros.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Kreel brings Starros forward]]\nAs they flew through the Dene Gois Cluster, Starros and her ship were spotted by a Imperial Star Destroyer. At first, she wanted to stay on course, but Solo convinced her to allow himself and friends to use the ''Volt Cobra''{{'s}} escape pods to evade the Empire. Starros had them jettison onto [[Hubin]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 56\" /> Without her burdens, she then evaded the Star Destroyer, only to be intercepted and captured by SCAR squadron.<ref name=\"Star Wars 60\">[[Star Wars (2015) 60|''Star Wars'' (2015) 60]]</ref> She was tortured by [[Interrogator droid]]s for information on the rebels' whereabouts, which subsequently took them to [[Hubin]]. There, Sergeant Kreel found Starros' friends at a mansion owned by Hubin's owner, [[Thane]] [[Markona]]. He threatened to kill Starros if the rebels did not reveal themselves, which easily lured them out. Markona's daughter, [[Tula Markona]], then stunned Solo and Organa, while Markona himself had Skywalker duel Kreel.<ref name=\"Star Wars 59\">[[Star Wars (2015) 59|''Star Wars'' (2015) 59]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Hey Sana.

She was determined to find the man she claimed was her husband and was willing to injure or even kill others in order to accomplish her goal.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\" /> She and Solo were not on good terms, and she felt that lying was the only thing he was good at.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5\" />\n\nStarros bore a grudge against her former lover Aphra for betraying her. In return, the rogue [[archaeologist]] despised her for being a rebel sympathizer.<ref name=\"SW16\" /> Though the two were forced to work together with Organa to help defeat the rogue rebel operative Ray, Starros was unable to overcome her hatred and resentment towards Aphra.<ref name=\"SW18\" /> Unlike Organa, Starros had no qualms about killing Imperials and took the opportunity to try and kill Aphra during a confrontation with Ray. Despite almost choking Aphra to death, Starros helped Aphra and Organa subdue Ray, ending his reign of terror. In spite of her hatred for Aphra, Starros helped her to escape her rebel captors by ejecting her into an escape pod.<ref name=\"SW19\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSana Starros was introduced as an unnamed masked character in the [[2015]] [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] [[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\" /> Her identity and alleged relationship to Han Solo was divulged in [[Star Wars (2015) 6|''Star Wars'' (2015) 6]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\" />\n\nOn [[March 18]], [[2021]], [[StarWars.com]] announced that ''Star Wars'' comic books released by Marvel Comics in [[June]] will have Pride Month variant covers that feature gay and transgender artists paired with LGBTQ+ characters.
