Unable to continue his work, he secretly let his son cover for him, a secret that soon became public knowledge. After Soontir won the annual harvest festival race for the second year running, his father announced that he would retire to work in the department store, leaving the flying formally to Soontir. The fact that he had broken Agr regulations in letting unauthorized personnel use company equipment was later used against the family when Soontir accused [[Ilir Post]] of attempted rape.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Special Edition]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Soontir Fels Vater\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fel, Soontir's father}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Fel family]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Unidentified fathers]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]"}}}]}}}}
