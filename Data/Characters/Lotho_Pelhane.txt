He had a daughter, [[Tyla Bezzard|Tyla]], who later [[Marriage/Legends|married]] [[Tellico Bezzard]], another local moisture farmer. As a result of frequent attacks by [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]], Gault set up the [[Settlers' Call Fund|Settlers' Call]], a fund into which members paid and which provided weapons and vehicles for its members' mutual defense. Pelhane was among those who chose not to join the fund. By [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Gault was struggling financially and was using the Settlers' Call Fund to pay off his personal debts. In order to increase membership, Gault and his children took to attacking those who had not joined, disguised as Tuskens. One such attack left Pelhane beaten and forced him to move in with his daughter and her husband while he recovered. As a result of the attack on Pelhane, the Bezzards joined the Settlers' Call. However, weeks later, their [[Bezzard farm|farm]] came under attack; although they alerted the other settlers, Pelhane was killed by the Tusken [[A'Yark/Legends|A'Yark]] before help could arrive.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']] {{1st|[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pelhane, Lotho}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
