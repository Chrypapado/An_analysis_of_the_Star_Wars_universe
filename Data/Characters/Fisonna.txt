When Fisonna was a child, he was the troublemaker of the [[Hiironi irstat]]. Despite his grandmother [[Cryalira]] being the Irstat-Kes, her position did not shield him from punishment. His grand schemes were usually directed against [[Human/Legends|Humans]] in the nearby towns of [[Gadrin and Hedrett]]. He also spied around the irstat, and knew everything that was going on.\n\nFisonna had very good control of his color-changing ability. He always wore rough medallions he had made himself from rocks and branches.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]"}}}]}}}}
