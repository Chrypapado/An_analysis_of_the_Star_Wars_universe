Forn would not refuse help to anyone, regardless of social or xenophobic reasons that would cause others to turn them away. When [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], a [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] in service to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], arrived on Taris after his [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the ''[[Endar Spire]]'', was destroyed following a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Attack on the Endar Spire|attack]], Forn asked him for assistance in procuring a [[Rakghoul serum|serum]] for the [[Rakghoul plague]], a disease that transformed those infected into [[rakghoul]]s&mdash;violent, deformed [[mutant]]s. Revan journeyed into the [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]] of Taris and found the corpse of a [[Unidentified Sith trooper (Rakghoul serum)|Sith soldier]] who was carrying some rakghoul serum. Despite a large offer of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from [[Gurney (Human)|Gurney]], Forn's own assistant, if Revan gave the serum to the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Davik Kang]], Revan chose to give the antidote to Forn instead, who proceeded to try and make it readily available to those infected by the plague. Although Taris was [[Destruction of Taris|bombed]] by the Sith, Forn's synthesized serum would be recovered over three [[Standard century/Legends|centuries]] later, and his work helped Republic [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]] make progress against the rakghoul virus that continued to plague Taris.\n\n==Biography==\n===Life on Taris===\n{{Quote|Do you require healing or medical supplies?

He was the founder and owner of a [[Zelka Forn's medical facility|medical facility]] that was used to heal those that were sick and wounded, and had a single assistant named [[Gurney (Human)|Gurney]]. Forn possessed a desire to help anyone who was hurt or injured, regardless of their [[Species/Legends|species]], [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], or [[Politics/Legends|political]] affiliation, which could have caused other [[Doctor/Legends|doctors]] to refuse service to them.<ref name=\"K1\" /> In [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"KotOR CG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> when the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Warship/Legends|warship]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'' was [[Attack on the Endar Spire|destroyed]] over Taris by the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]], a few Republic [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] managed to escape. As the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] occupied the planet, Forn received all the proper permits to keep his facility running from the newly appointed [[Sith Governor]]. Forn recovered and took care of some of the Republic soldiers, putting them in [[kolto tank]]s in a back room of his facility, even with the possibility of being arrested by the Sith for giving care to soldiers affiliated with the Empire's enemy. Forn knew that they would never fully recover, as their wounds were too extensive, but he did what he could to make their last few [[Standard day/Legends|days]] comfortable.<ref name=\"K1\" />\n\n===Finding a cure===\n{{Quote|Hmmm&hellip; let me see&hellip; yes, this is it!

The plague caused a great deal of trouble to some on Taris, due to the fact that the Sith, after overrunning a [[Tarisian military base]] which contained the only samples of [[Rakghoul serum|an antidote]], reserved it for their own soldiers patrolling in the rakghoul-populated [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]] of Taris. Forn grieved for the [[Outcasts (Taris)|Outcasts]], people who lived in the Undercity who had been&mdash;or whose ancestors had been&mdash;cast out of the Upper City and were forced to encounter and experience the disease's effects on a daily basis. Forn spent a great deal of time researching the cause of the rakghoul infection.

Shan had evacuated with a number of other Republic personnel from the ''Endar Spire'' and reached the planet.<ref name=\"K1\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nOn Taris, Revan arrived at Forn's facility and discovered the Republic soldiers in his back room. Revan was impressed by the doctor's compassion and agreed not to disclose the location of the Republic soldiers to the Sith. Forn felt the soldiers would [[Death/Legends|die]] from the plague or be captured, and he did not want that to happen. From Forn, Revan learned about the serum and where it was kept. As Revan was leaving to retrieve the antidote from the Sith base, Gurney, Forn's assistant, drew Revan aside and told him about [[Davik Kang]], the local [[Crime lord/Legends|leader]] of the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] criminal group [[Exchange]], who also wanted the serum. Gurney promised that Kang would pay a much higher price for the serum than Forn would ever be able to. When Revan and his companions traveled to the Undercity, Revan found the corpse of a [[Unidentified Sith trooper (Rakghoul serum)|Sith trooper]] who was carrying the Rakghoul serum. Taking the serum, Revan spurned Kang's offer and instead gave it to Forn, who offered him fifty [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and two [[Medpac/Legends|medpacs]] for it. Revan refused, however, believing Forn needed the credits more than he and his companions did. Forn synthesized the serum to sell it cheaply to those infected, and he also gave Revan a discount on all of his stock, saying it was the least he could do.<ref name=\"K1\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|The last breakthrough was three centuries ago.

During the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the Republic and a [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]], [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] from the [[Death's Claw]] gang recovered the serum from the remains of the hospital, though they found that it was not entirely effective on account of the rakghoul virus' mutation. Doctor [[Ianna Cel]], with the [[Taris Resettlement Initiative]], hired a Republic operative to retrieve the serum from Sepanik, and the individual was able to recover some of the serum from the Death's Claw after learning that the pirates had taken all of the serum. Though Forn's serum was not enough to protect against present-day rakghouls, Cel was optimistic about synthesizing a cure by learning from Forn's work.<ref name=\"A Cure For A Planet\">{{TORcite|type=faction|Republic|Pirate Medicine|Taris}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Still, you are welcome here. I'll not have it said that Zelka Forn refused to help somebody just because they weren't a citizen of Taris.|Zelka Forn, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nForn was an elderly man who had dark skin, [[Color/Legends|graying black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], a moustache and brown [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. He had extensive medical training and was able to cure many injuries despite a shortage of resources in his medical facility. He had an extreme concern for others, evident by his wish to medically help everyone who was ill. He would not refuse help to anyone, even if they were an off-worlder or [[Alien/Legends|alien]], or even if he hated the person. That differed from the mentality of most of the Human population of Taris, who were xenophobic and considered themselves superior to aliens. Forn feared the Sith because he believed that they might one day close down his clinic, and he preferred not to have anything to do with them. When Revan gave him the serum and declined his reward, Forn considered Revan to be very noble, but still believed that Revan deserved something for his efforts.<ref name=\"K1\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nZelka Forn first appeared as a non-playable character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', developed by [[BioWare]]. He was voiced by [[Daran Norris]].{{Fact}} Forn also gained an entry in [[2008]]'s ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|I|290|Forn, Zelka}}</ref> Although the player has multiple choices in regards to how he or she acts and treats Zelka Forn, the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] choices are those that are [[canon]]ical. The game can also be played without Revan's visit to the medical facility, meaning that Forn is never encountered. If the player follows the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], they can threaten to tell the Sith about the Republic soldiers unless Forn hands over credits to keep them quiet. If the soldier Carth Onasi or Bastila Shan are in the party, they will protest against such an action. When trying to gain entry to the room of Forn's facility where the Republic soldiers are, Revan can either bash down the door or [[Slicer/Legends|bypass]] the locks. If the player declares allegiance to the Republic, Forn can also simply show the soldiers to the player.<ref name=\"K1\" />\n\nThe player can also sell the Rakghoul serum to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] criminal [[Zax]] and earn one thousand credits. If the player has a high enough persuade skill, they can persuade Zax into paying one thousand five hundred credits for the serum. Both options result in the player gaining dark side points. The player can still buy a copy of the serum from Forn, albeit at a higher price, and Forn will also hold resentment toward the player. Should the player approach Forn while wearing [[Sith trooper armor/Legends|Sith trooper armor]], Forn will maintain that he has the correct permits and will ask the player to leave, saying he doesn't want any trouble. If, however, the player angers or harasses Forn too much, the option to give the serum to Forn is lost, although he will still offer supplies and healing to the player.<ref name=\"K1\" /> The [[2011]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' revealed that Revan had in fact given the serum to Forn, as Forn's serum played a major part in the quest \"Pirate Medicine.\"<ref name=\"A Cure For A Planet\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zelka Forn\n|es=Zelka Forn\n|fi=Zelka Forn\n|pl=Zelka Forn\n|ru=\u0417\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0424\u043e\u0440\u043d\n|ruGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forn, Zelka}}\n[[Category:Healers and doctors]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
