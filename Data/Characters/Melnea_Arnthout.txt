Is that you?|Melnea Arnthout and 2PO|Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley}}\n'''Melnea Arnthout''' was a leader of a group of colonists on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. One of the crew members who crashed the [[Dowager Queen/Legends|''Dowager Queen'']] into Tatooine, Arnthout helped found Tatooine's first settlement. She owned a [[2PO-series protocol droid]] that was captured by [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]]. The city [[Arnthout/Legends|Arnthout]] was named after her.\n\n==Biography==\nMelnea Arnthout was the leader of the colonists who headed to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]<ref name=\"GG7\" /> around [[100 BBY/Legends|100 BBY]] with the intent of establishing a [[Mining/Legends|mining]] colony. Arnthout supervised the construction of temporary shelters, and organized mining and security details.<ref name=\"SoT\">''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''</ref>\n\nUpon arrival, Arnthout and the colonists encountered a native [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Species/Legends|species]] that were instinctive cowards, but coveted the colonist's technology. The first season after establishing the colony&mdash;named [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]]&mdash;was harsh; one of the [[Colony ship/Legends|colony ships]], the [[Dowager Queen/Legends|''Dowager Queen'']], crashed [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]] away from Bestine and denied the colonists vital supplies. [[Sandstorm/Legends|Sandstorms]] nearly destroyed the settlement, most of the [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] disappeared, and the colonists barely grew enough [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] to survive. The theft of Arnthout's [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], [[2PO]], enraged the settlers, forcing her to act. Arnthout knew that she had to assuage the colonist's fears, retrieve valuable property, and get the natives to stop interfering with their equipment and supplies.<ref name=\"GG7\" />\n\nArnthout set out to negotiate with the natives, eventually rescuing a pair from a [[Dewback/Legends|dewback]] that had it's front paw trapped. Freeing the dewback, she allowed the natives to saddle the beast and led it and her back to their camp. At the camp, Arnthout found her missing droid, 2PO, and learned that the natives were called [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]]. The Jawas had borrowed the droid out of curiosity rather than malice, and the protocol droid had learned about the Jawa's culture and language. Arnthout asked the droid to tell her all about them.<ref name=\"RHP\">{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley|story=Between A Rock And A Hard Place}}</ref>\n\nArnthout negotiated a non-aggression pact with the Jawas, water rights, salvage rights to the ''Dowager Queen'', and free trade of information.<ref name=\"SoT\" /> After Arnthout's meeting with the Jawas, the settlers adopted the Jawa name for the planet, learned about the planet's geography and native wildlife, and were warned about the planet's other native species, the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]].<ref name=\"GG7\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley|story=Between A Rock And A Hard Place}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''\n*{{GamerCite|3|The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Jawas}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|melneaarhthout|Arnthout, Melnea|archivedate=20100209202421}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Arnthout's Armor}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arnhout, Melnea}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
