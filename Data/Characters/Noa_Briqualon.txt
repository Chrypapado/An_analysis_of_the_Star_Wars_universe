The shipwreck occurred around the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[26 BBY/Legends|26 BBY]], when Briqualon and his friend [[Salak Weet]] set out to chart the [[Moddell sector/Legends|Moddell sector]]. When Weet left their crash site in search of a replacement for the [[Starship/Legends|ship's]] broken [[crystal oscillator]], he was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by a band of stranded [[Sanyassan Marauders]]; left to his own devices, Briqualon made a [[Noa Briqualon's hut|home]] for himself inside a hollowed-out tree. With a furry [[Teek (species)/Legends|Teek]] named [[Teek]] as his only companion, he spent years repairing the crashed [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]], which remained grounded without a functioning oscillator.\n\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Teek found the orphaned Human [[Youngling/Legends|girl]] [[Cindel Towani]] and her [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] friend [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]], and welcomed them into Briqualon's home. The scout gruffly sent them away, but as the two children had no place to go, Briqualon reluctantly allowed them to [[Sleep/Legends|sleep]] on his floor. He initially claimed that the invitation was for a single night, but on their third [[Standard day/Legends|day]] with him, they followed him to the site of his [[Star Cruiser/Legends|star cruiser]] and prompted him to share his entire story. Briqualon grew protective of Towani and bonded with her in an almost [[Parent/Legends|grandfatherly]] way, and when she was kidnapped by the [[Sanyassan]] Marauders and taken to their [[Terak's Keep|castle stronghold]] the next morning, he immediately set out to rescue her.\n\nBriqualon, Warrick, and Teek infiltrated the [[castle]] and rescued both Towani and a group of her Ewok friends. They also retrieved the [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]] oscillator from [[Towani family star cruiser|Towani's own star cruiser]], which the Marauders had stolen after [[Raid on Bright Tree Village|killing]] the girl's [[Towani family|family]]. Returning to the site of his crashed ship, Briqualon used the oscillator to power up the cruiser while the Ewoks [[Battle of Endor (Ewok&ndash;Sanyassan conflict)|held off]] the pursuing Marauders. He was forced to duel the [[Sword/Legends|sword]]-wielding Marauder [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]] with only a walking stick, but the fight ended when Terak was burned to death by the power of a [[Talisman of the Raven|magic ring]] he wore around his neck. With the [[Star/Legends|star]] cruiser finally operational, Briqualon and Towani left Endor, and the old scout eventually retired in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] [[Mid Rim]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Crash landing===\n{{Quote|My friend Salak and I&hellip; we were a couple of young fellas out to tear up the galaxy!

One [[Standard day/Legends|day]]<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" /> in the latter half of [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]],<ref name=\"Behind the Magic\">''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''</ref> he returned home from his star cruiser and found two visitors in his hut&mdash;Teek had brought home the [[Youngling/Legends|young Human girl]] [[Cindel Towani]] and her [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] friend, [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]]. Briqualon reacted angrily and kicked the new arrivals out; with no place to go, they parked themselves on a log outside the hut. A grumbling Briqualon finished cooking the dinner they had begun to make, and he instructed Teek to not give any food to Towani and Warrick. However, when Teek used his lightning-fast speed to rush outside and hand the children some [[muffin]]s, Briqualon observed through a [[Window/Legends|window]] and held his tongue when Teek returned. Towani and Warrick soon built a [[Fire/Legends|fire]], and Briqualon brought them inside, asserting that the fire was unsafe. Both children went to [[Sleep/Legends|sleep]] on the floor, but when Towani woke up screaming from a [[Dream/Legends|nightmare]], Briqualon gave up his own [[Sleeper (furniture)|bed]].<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" />\n\n[[File:Someonesbeeneatingmyporridge.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Briqualon kicks Cindel Towani and Wicket Warrick out of his home.]]\nBriqualon left for his star cruiser in the morning after instructing Warrick to go on his way. The scout nevertheless put together two child-sized sleeping mats while he was out, and was disappointed to arrive home and find that his guests were gone. However, the children soon returned from a [[Plant/Legends|flower]]-picking jaunt, and Briqualon helped them use the flowers to bake a [[Pie/Legends|pie]]. After dinner, he tucked them into their new beds and let them stay another night. In the morning, he told them to make themselves useful by cleaning the hut; instead, the curious children followed him to the star cruiser. Briqualon was alerted to their presence when an alarm sounded inside the ship, and he helped an upside-down Warrick out of a snare trap before reluctantly bringing both children aboard the cruiser.<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" />\n\nWith all of his barriers broken down, the scout told the children his story and finally admitted to himself that Weet was not coming back. Towani's [[Towani family|family]] had similarly been [[Raid on Bright Tree Village|murdered]] by the Marauders, and Briqualon invited her and Warrick to permanently stay with him. Back at the hut, he entertained his new companions with a [[Music/Legends|song]] played on a [[Flute/Legends|flute]]. Towani happily danced along, but she soon grew dejected over the loss of her family, and Briqualon comforted her. The next morning, Warrick awoke Briqualon and announced that Towani was missing. When the scout went searching for her, he and Warrick came across Towani being carried away on the [[Charal's stallion|stallion]] of the Human woman [[Charal]], an associate of King Terak's. Briqualon immediately returned to his hut to retrieve a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], an [[Ascension gun/Legends|ascension gun]], and some [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonators]]. Along with Warrick and Teek, he set out after Towani.<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" />\n\n===The Battle for Endor===\n{{Quote|OK. Now all you gotta do is hold 'em off until I get the power going. You understand me? If you can buy me some time we just might have a chance.|Briqualon marshals his Ewoks troops prior to the Marauder attack|audio=MightHaveAChance-BFE.ogg|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\nThe trio followed Charal's trail to [[Terak's Keep]],<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" /> the [[Sanyassan]] Marauders' [[castle]] stronghold in the [[Dragon's Pelt]] savanna.<ref name=\"Illustrated\">''[[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe]]''</ref> Rather than swim through the black [[Water/Legends|waters]] of the [[moat]], Briqualon fired his ascension gun's [[Grappling hook/Legends|grappling hook]] at the top of a curtain wall. He was the last to climb the [[Rope/Legends|rope]], and his ascent was sped up when Warrick tied the rope's other end around the ankle of a [[Unidentified eyepatched Sanyassan|Sanyassan guard]] and pushed him into the moat. Sneaking through the castle, the three came to King Terak's throne room, which was filled with dining Marauders. After Teek darted in to retrieve some [[Clothing/Legends|robes]], Briqualon donned the apparel and placed Warrick on his shoulders. Teek hung close behind the scout's [[Limb/Legends|legs]], and the disguised trio shuffled past the unassuming Marauders. Their next stop was the [[Prison/Legends|dungeon]], where two guards sat engrossed in a card game. Briqualon tasked Teek with retrieving the keys from [[Unidentified Sanyassan prison warden|one guard]], and the stealthy Teek also succeeded in slipping a card up the guard's sleeve. When the [[Unidentified black-mustachioed Sanyassan|other Marauder]] spotted it, an argument ensued that ended with both men shooting each other in the chest.<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" />\n\n[[File:Dueloftheages.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Briqualon duels King Terak on the forest floor.]]\nBriqualon used the keys to free the [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] Towani and a group of her Ewok friends, all of whom had been captured when the Marauders had raided their [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|village]] and killed Towani's family. Warrick and his [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Deej Warrick|Deej]], grabbed the downed guards' blasters as the group attempted to escape, but an encounter with a guard in the corridor forced them back into the dungeon. As Wicket and Deej Warrick covered him, Briqualon set a thermal detonator and blew a hole in the dungeon wall. He then tossed his grappling hook at a monolith that stood outside the castle, and as the Ewoks swung to safety, Towani directed Briqualon's attention to the [[Bone/Legends|skeleton]] of Weet, which hung on the dungeon wall. When she revealed that Weet had been killed for the \"power thing,\" Briqualon spotted the [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]] oscillator from the Towanis' [[Towani family star cruiser|star cruiser]]. It had been taken in the Ewok village raid, and a naive Charal had kidnapped Towani with the hope that the young girl could use it to [[magic]]ally grant the Marauders spaceflight. Briqualon snatched it up, and after everyone had escaped, he led them in a rush back to his ship. Guided by Charal, who had used a [[Talisman of the Raven|magical ring]] to [[Metamorphosis (Force power)|metamorphose]] into a [[raven]], the Marauders followed closely behind.<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" />\n\nAt the site of his star cruiser, Briqualon put Warrick in charge of using his traps to hold off the Marauders. He then brought Towani and four other Ewoks aboard to help him install the oscillator, which he hoped would allow the cruiser to fly. After several failed attempts, Briqualon got the ship powered up, while Teek and the Ewoks did [[Battle of Endor (Ewok&ndash;Sanyassan conflict)|battle]] with the Marauders using Briqualon's traps and their own crude weapons. With power restored, the scout manned one of the star cruiser's [[Quad laser cannon/Legends|quad laser cannons]] and began to [[Laser/Legends|fire]] at his enemies. Overwhelmed by the defense, all of the Marauders fled save Terak, who grabbed Towani after she rushed outside to free Warrick from a trap.<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" />\n\nTerak sent Wicket and Deej Warrick into the cruiser to demand a trade: \"the power\" in exchange for Towani's safety. Briqualon brought the oscillator out to Terak with an alternative proposal&mdash;if he let Towani go, Briqualon would fight him for the oscillator. The King obliged, and the scout attacked his foe with his walking stick. Terak wielded a [[Sword/Legends|sword]] and quickly gained the upper hand in the duel; however, when he knocked Briqualon to the ground, Teek intervened by jumping onto Terak's head. When the King shook him loose and continued to attack a defenseless Briqualon, Warrick desperately used a [[sling]] to fire a stone at Terak. It struck Charal's [[Ring/Legends|ring]], hanging on a cord around the King's neck, and the broken ring unleashed its energy and burned Terak to death where he stood.<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" />\n\nIn the battle's aftermath, Briqualon offered to bring Towani with him when he left Endor on his now-functional star cruiser,<ref name=\"Fact File\">{{FFCite|123|TOW3&ndash;4, ''Cindel Towani''}}</ref> and she agreed.<ref name=\"Battle for Endor\" /> It took several days to finish preparing the ship.<ref name=\"storybook\">''[[The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure]]''</ref> As the two prepared to lift off, Teek and the Ewoks gathered outside.
