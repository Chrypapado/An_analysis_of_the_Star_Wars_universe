He was sent to [[Ohma-D'un/Legends|Ohma-D'un]], where he was to serve as a [[Third Grade Assistant Technician]].\n\nVanneb was a friendly, talkative man who enjoyed discussing ship engines and the maintenance of environmental systems. Kharl was a long-time friend of [[Sakme Kelene]], also a Theed School of Technology and Engineering graduate, and the two had both applied for positions at the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] moon base on Ohma-D'un together.\n\nKharl and Sakme, along with [[Professor/Legends|Professor]] [[Hallem Celaar]], were both aboard the [[Fair Gale]], flown by [[Worlohp|Captain Worlohp]] and bound for the moon base on Ohma-D'un, when a collision with hull remnants from a [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] vessel caused an unexpected [[Kyvalon-4]] leak, creating mayhem onboard and necessitating the captain's subdual by a group of passengers.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GamerCite|1|Peril in the Ionosphere}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vanneb, Kharl}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
