Even if its only one little bit at a time.|Magir Paca|A Glimmer of Hope}}\n'''Magir Paca''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who served the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] as a leader of the [[Committee of Seven for Garosian Unification|underground resistance]] on [[Garos IV]].\n\n==Biography==\nMagir Paca was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Garos IV]].<ref name=\"GH\" /> His [[Magir Paca's father|father]] was good friends with [[Tork Winger]],<ref name=\"TP\">{{Journal|5|Turning Point}}</ref> and Paca grew up calling him \"Uncle\".<ref name=\"GH\" /> When Paca began his governmental service, it was as an aide to Winger, who was serving as the Assistant [[Minister of Defense (Garos IV)|Minister of Defense]]. For over ten [[Standard year/Legends|years]] Paca served the government with Winger as his mentor. By [[6 BBY/Legends|6 BBY]], Paca held the post of Assistant [[Minister of Commerce (Garos IV)|Minister of Commerce]]. Unlike his mentor, who saw the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] as a positive force in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], Paca despised the Empire and saw that it was a threat to Garos IV. He was one of the original leaders of the Garosian resistance, known as the [[Committee of Seven for Garosian Unification]]. The resistance worked to end the [[Garosian Civil War]] between the native [[Garosian]]s and the [[Sundari/Legends|Sundari]] colonists by convincing them that the Empire was the true enemy.<ref name=\"TP\" />\n\nPaca, along with [[Desto Mayda]] and Sundari radical [[Camron Gelorik]], convinced a young [[Dair Haslip]] to join the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]] as a [[Spy/Legends|spy]]. Haslip, who had been enthusiastic about joining the Empire until seeing his friend&mdash;and Desto Mayda's son&mdash;[[Jos Mayda|Jos]] killed by Imperial [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout troopers]], agreed.<ref name=\"TP\" />\n\nPaca's governmental position allowed him to covertly supply useful information and intelligence to the resistance. In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Imperial forces realized there was a intelligence leak and set a trap to catch the perpetrator. Evidence against Paca was compiled, and the Empire suspected he was a member of the resistance and built a case against him. Fortunately for Paca, Governor Winger's adopted daughter, [[Alexandra Winger|Alexandra]] had [[Slicer/Legends|sliced]] into the Imperial [[Computer/Legends|computer]] files and discovered the information pertaining to Paca. Alexandra warned him of the danger, and Paca managed to disappear before Imperial [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] could arrest him. Going underground, Paca took a more active role in the resistance, and began to coordinate the underground's activities.<ref name=\"GH\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|5|Turning Point}}\n*{{Journal|1|A Glimmer of Hope}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=A Glimmer of Hope}}\n*{{Journal|2|Whispers in the Dark}}\n*{{Journal|3|Mission to Zila}}\n*{{Journal|4|Shadows of Darkness}}\n*{{Journal|6|Rendezvous with Destiny}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paca, Magir}}\n[[Category:Garosians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
