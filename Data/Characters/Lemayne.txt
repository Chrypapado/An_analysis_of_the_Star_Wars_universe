He founded the mercy organization [[Grace Command]] as a cover for his intelligence operations in the service of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. One of Grace Command's operations included [[Operation Deluge]] which involved inundating Sith-occupied space with the [[Spice/Legends|spice]] [[Deluge]] to undermine the Sith war effort without having to divert substantial government resources. The operation was conducted under the cover of the mercy organization [[Grace Command]] and the supposedly voluntary [[Starfighter/Legends|Starfighters]] squadron [[Devil Squadron]]. In the process, entire civilian populations were inundated with the drug which destabilized entire planets throughout the [[Grumani sector]].\n\nFollowing the [[Aquilaris campaign]] and the [[Battle of Darkknell]], Devaad and Holt came up with a strategy to sabotage Operation Deluge. Devaad would return to Grace Command and claim that she had gotten for distributing the Deluge on [[Aquilaris Minor]]. This ensured that Grace Command would continue to send a transport ship which Devaad would personally fly to and from Sith occupied words. En route, she would get rid of the Deluge while returning to the Republic with civilian refugees.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Knight Errant: Deluge 2|''Knight Errant: Deluge'' 2]] {{1stm}}\n*[[Knight Errant: Deluge 3|''Knight Errant: Deluge'' 3]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Knight Errant: Deluge 5|''Knight Errant: Deluge'' 5]] {{Mo}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic intelligence personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
