He collected rare technology and once owned the [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] program named [[Holiday (hologram)|Holiday]] but according to [[Tharan Cedrax]], he disregarded the hologram's potential. When Glorzo decided to sell Holiday, both Cedrax and a [[Unidentified scavenger|scavenger]] put up offers for her so Glorzo proposed a contest between the two individuals. The buyers were to head to the [[Vaal asteroid field]], survive for more than two [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]] and bring back a stone from the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] [[Rukabi Major]]. The first one to succeed in this would win Holiday from Glorzo and that was Cedrax, who succeeeded days ahead of the [[Scavenger/Legends|scavenger]].\n\nGlorzo was considered the owner of the largest, galaxy-wide collection of [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] artifacts.<ref name=\"Glorzo\">{{TORcite|type=crewskill|Archaeology|Glorzo's Gifts}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Glorzo#legends\n}}\n\n[[Category:Collectors]]\n[[Category:Hutt Cartel individuals]]\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
