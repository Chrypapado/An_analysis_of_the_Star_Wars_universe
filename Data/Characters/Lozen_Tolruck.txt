But he's got three Star Destroyers up there and intel says he's hidden away in an island fortress.|[[Jom Barell]] and [[Han Solo]]|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n'''Lozen Tolruck''' was a [[Gender|male]] individual that served the [[Galactic Empire]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]] as a [[Grand Moff]]. In this position, he ruled as the [[governor]] of [[Kashyyyk]], known as Imperial territory G5-623. He enslaved nearly the entire [[Wookiee]] population and forced them into labor camps, implanting [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] to prevent their escape. After the [[Battle of Endor]], he locked down the [[planet]] and kept the [[Darth Sidious|Emperor's]] [[death]] a secret from his [[troop]]s. He was killed during the [[liberation of Kashyyyk]] by [[Subject 6391-A|Cracktooth]], a former slave of his.\n\n==Biography==\n===Grand Moff of Kashyyyk===\nA [[Gender|male]] individual, Lozen Tolruck served as [[Grand Moff]] of [[Kashyyyk]], which was renamed Imperial territory G5-623, during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Following the [[Battle of Endor]], Tolruck claimed that [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] was still alive and well. He treated the indigenous [[Wookiee]]s as a disposable [[Slavery|slave]] labor force and kept them docile using [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]].<ref name=\"LD\" /> By [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Kashyyyk was one of the remaining Imperial holdouts in [[The galaxy|a galaxy]] that was increasingly controlled by the [[New Republic]], the successor government to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Tolruck had a difficult [[time]] accepting the authority of [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], who commanded [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]] in the [[Vulpinus Nebula]].<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nFollowing the rescue of rebel [[prisoner]]s from [[Ashmead's Lock]], Tolruck's Imperial forces on Kashyyyk came under attack from a rebel insurgency led by the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] and the [[Wookiee]] co-[[pilot]] [[Chewbacca]], who had come to [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberate]] the Wookiee [[homeworld]]. Despite evidence to the contrary, Tolruck claimed there was no revolt on Kashyyyk and dismissed the insurgents as a \"little cancerous shadow\" clinging to the Imperial operation on G5-623. When his [[troop]]s captured the [[New Republic soldier]] [[Jom Barell]], Lozen [[torture]]d him in an attempt to extract information. When Barell proved resistant, he gouged out one of his [[eye]]s and locked him in a cage.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nLater, Tolruck remotely controlled an [[SD-K4 assassin droid|assassin probe]] with a control visor and used it to hunt down and [[Death|kill]] a Wookiee slave named [[Subject 478-98]] or \"Blackstripe.\" When Blackstripe proved unexpectedly difficult to kill, Tolruck threw a tantrum and smashed the visor he had used to control the [[assassin]] probe. Tolruck then met with his attache [[Odair Bel-Opis]] to discuss the threat of the rebel insurgency on Kashyyyk. Tolruck disagreed with Odair's assessment that the rebels posed a serious threat and vowed to [[Hunting|hunt]] them down himself for sport. He even toyed with the idea of using the captive Barell as bait.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n===Hunting the hunter===\nOdair then informed Tolruck that they had received an [[emissary]] from Grand [[Admiral]] Sloane. As a snub to Sloane's authority, Tolruck kept the emissary waiting and instead had a conference with [[Commandant]] [[Theodane Sardo]] via [[hologram]]. Due to a drop in the demand for Wookiee slaves, Sardo proposed [[farm]]ing the Wookiees of Kashyyyk for their meat. When Tolruck saw an explosion in the background at [[Camp Sardo]], Sardo claimed that they had merely lost a [[turret]]. Tolruck liked Sardo's recommendation and ordered him to explore the idea. Unknown to Tolruck and Sardo, Han and Chewie's team had landed near the former [[tree]] [[city]] of [[Awrathakka]] above Camp Sardo.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nTolruck then went to meet with Sloane's emissary, who turned out to be a disguised [[Sinjir Rath Velus]]. The former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] had defected to the New Republic and joined Han's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk. Sinjir pretended to be [[lieutenant]] [[Jorrin Turnbull]], an [[Imperial officer]] who had died during the Battle of Endor. Tolruck took the opportunity to chastise Sloane's Empire for abandoning the Imperial presence on Kashyyyk and not taking their Wookiee slaves offworld. Sinjir then briefed Tolruck about Han Solo's insurgency on Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nIntending to free hims comrade Jom Barell, Sinjir inquired about the rebel [[prison]]er. Tolruck then ordered Odair to bring out Jom in an iron kennel on [[grav-pads]]. Before Sinjir could leave, one of Tolruck's aides handed Odair a [[Viewscreen|holoscreen]], which identified the prisoner in the cage as Jom. While browsing through the holoscreen, Tolruck recognized Sinjir as a wanted enemy of the Empire. Before Sinjir could escape the chamber, Tolruck stabbed him in the calf of his [[Limb|leg]] with a [[kishakk blade]].<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n===Hubris and demise===\nTolruck then forced a wounded Sinjir to fight Odair for his amusement. While Sinjir was a capable fighter, he was no match for Odair due to his wounded leg. After Odair bested Sinjir in the first round, Tolruck asked his prisoner whether he had come for his friend Jom. A defiant Sinjir revealed that he had come for Tolruck's [[control module]], which he kept on his person. When Tolruck boasted that he had full control over the module and the inhibitor chips, Sinjir responded that he had [[hyperwave transceiver]] spike hidden in his heel. Sinjir then smugly informed Tolruck that his transceiver could hack into his control module.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nAt that moment, the [[datapad]] in Tolruck's left hand began to flesh red. At that point, all the inhibitor chips on Kashyyyk were disabled and the Wookiees rose up in a [[planet]]wide uprising against the Empire. The freed Wookiee slaves quickly overpowered their Imperial captors. Tolruck fled but not before ordering his aide Odair to kill Sinjir. Before Odair could kill the formerly loyal [[officer]], he was ripped apart by several enraged Wookiee slaves. Meanwhile, Han and Chewie's team destroyed the [[deflector shield generator]] at Camp Sardo.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nHaving lost control of Kashyyyk, Tolruck ordered his orbiting [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyers]] to initiate [[orbital bombardment]] of the planet. After freeing themselves, Sinjir and Jom confronted the Grand Moff at his throne. However, Tolruck smugly responded that he had orders his Star Destroyers to destroy all life on Kashyyyk's surface including himself, the Wookiees, and his rebel opponents. Sensing that Tolruck had succumbed to madness, the two abandoned the Grand Moff to his fate. While Tolruck laughed in madness, one of his former slaves [[Subject 6391-A]] (\"Cracktooth\") sneaked up behind him and broke his neck; killing him.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nLozen Tolruck was a ruthless and sadistic man who hunted Wookiees for amusement. Tolruck viewed the Wookiees of Kashyyyk as livestock and used inhibitor chips to keep them docile and subservient. As Grand Moff of Kashyyyk, Tolruck surrounded himself with several ruthless and sadistic killers including his Attache Odair Bel-Opis and Commandant Theodane Sardo, who shared his lust for violence and cruelty. After the Empire reduced its operations on Kashyyyk following the Battle of Endor, Tolruck came to regard himself as the de-facto ruler and god of Kashyyyk. Tolruck also idealized himself as a hunter and enjoyed inflicting harm on other beings.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nTolruck wore a long, unkempt beard that covered his cheeks and jowls. He also wore a robe made from the pelt of an [[Arrawtha-dyr]]. Tolruck had poor standards of hygiene and did not bathe for weeks. He liked the stench of his own unwashed body and had dirty nails. Tolruck enjoyed eating [[wrosha-grub]]s whole and uncooked. Despite his overweight physique, Tolruck was fast enough to stab Sinjir on one occasion with a kishakk blade. He also had a taste for the flesh of [[Talz]], a [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]], and liked Commandant Sardo's idea of farming Wookiees for [[Foodstuff|food]].<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nTolruck was also willing to use torture to obtain results and once gouged out an eye from the New Republic operative Jom Barell and flung it into a campsite fire. Later, he forced another prisoner Sinjir to fight his attache Odair for amusement. However, Tolruck's complacency led him to underestimate Sinjir's plan to free the Wookiees by using a hyperwave transceiver to neutralize the control module controlling the inhibitor chips that kept the Wookiees docile. Tolruck was also partly insane and even ordered the orbital bombardment of Kashyyyk in an effort to deny the planet to the Empire's enemies. He was willing to order even in his own death and laughed maniacally.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLozen Tolruck first appeared as a secondary point-of-view villain in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2016]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|55|Databank A-Z|Saesee Tiin&ndash;Toydaria}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[The Star Wars Book]]''\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|The Battle of Endor and the Fall of the Empire}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lozen Tolruck\n|es=Lozen Tolruck\n|ru=\u041b\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043d \u0422\u043e\u043b\u0440\u0430\u043a\n|pl=Lozen Tolruck\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tolruck, Lozen}}\n[[Category:Grand Moffs of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
