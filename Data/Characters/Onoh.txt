He was kidnapped by [[Gizman]] and [[Spiker]] when they stole the ''[[Spirit of Jabba]]'' after the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] [[Death/Legends|death]], and associated with them as a reluctant [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Gardulla's servant===\n[[File:GTH.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Onoh (right) and [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder/Legends|Gardulla]]]]\n{{Quotetrans|Most very pleased is Gardulla the Hutt to welcome mighty Jabba to this humble lodge.|Onoh greeting [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]|Podracing Tales}}\nOnoh worked as the servant of [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder/Legends|Gardulla Besadii the Elder]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], and greeted [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] to Gardulla's lodge prior to the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]. The [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] wagered on which [[Podracer/Legends|Podracer]] would win the event, and shared a worried glance with his mistress as Jabba took Gardulla's bet and departed.<ref name=\"Podracing Tales\" />\n\n===Jabba's watchman===\n{{Quote|This is Master Jabba's private property! It is unwise to anger Master Jabba&mdash;even after death!|Onoh to [[Gizman]] and [[Spiker]]|The Jabba Tape}}\nOnoh worked for some [[Standard year/Legends|years]] as a watchman for [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] at the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] secret hangar in [[Glass Mountain]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], containing the ''[[Spirit of Jabba]]'' and eight priceless [[Mendacian funeral urn]]s from the [[Krung Dynasty]]. He received annual payments from the Hutt, and lived in a hovel at the mountain. Following Jabba's death, Onoh was menaced by several thugs dispatched by [[Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo/Legends|Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo]] looking to gain access to Jabba's storehouse, and tortured the watchman with [[dune biter]]s into giving up the secret entranceway. Gorga ordered Onoh killed, but the arrival of [[Gizman|Big Gizz]] and [[Spiker]] spared him. The two [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] confirmed Jabba's death, and hijacked the ''Spirit of Jabba'' along with Onoh, recruiting him as a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]]. They soon encountered the [[Jabba Tape]] while attempting to escape from Gorga, and the interactive security tape took control of the ship. However, they were shot down by the [[escort freighter]] ''[[Nemphas]]'', and Onoh keyed in the operating code he'd memorized, betraying Jabba but allowing his new companions to assume control of the ship. Swooping over [[Gorga's private strip]] in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], Onoh helped Spiker jettison the ship's cargo onto Gorga and his associates. After a pursuit, the pirates crashed and made their way through the [[Desert/Legends|desert]].<ref name=\"The Jabba Tape\" />\n\nSome time later, the trio were camped near the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena/Legends|Mos Espa Grand Arena]], which had fallen into disrepair, when a runaway [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Sandcrawler/Legends|sandcrawler]] came out of nowhere and destroyed Gizz's bike. As the only member of the gang who understood the Jawa language, Onoh communicated with the sole survivor of the accident, [[Klepti B'ay]], who explained that his clan had been wiped out by a terrifying battle droid they had mistakenly salvaged and reactivated. An [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[dark trooper]] droid emerged from the wreckage of the sandcrawler and attacked the gang. After Gizz and Spiker threw everything they had at the deadly machine to slow it down, Klepti and Onoh finished it off by dropping a large boulder on top of it from a ledge. Now augmented by Klepti, who proclaimed that he owed a [[Life debt/Legends|life debt]] to Gizz, the gang left the scene.<ref name=\"Sand Blasted\">{{Tales|4|Sand Blasted}}</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance and traits==\nA [[Lizling]], Onoh had scaly [[Color/Legends|yellow]] skin and large, bulbous eyes. Two long barbels hung from his chin, and he possessed a thin tail and claws on his hands and toes. He typically wore a ragged brown tunic and a blue hood. Onoh was loyal to Jabba, though displayed cowardly traits and gave up the secret of [[Glass Mountain]] under the threat of torture from [[dune biter]]s. He spoke both [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]]<ref name=\"The Jabba Tape\" /> and [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].<ref name=\"Podracing Tales\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Podracing Tales]]''\n*[[Boba Fett: Enemy of the Empire 3|''Boba Fett: Enemy of the Empire'' 3]]\n*''[[The Jabba Tape]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{Tales|4|Sand Blasted}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Besadii servants]]\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Lizlings]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
