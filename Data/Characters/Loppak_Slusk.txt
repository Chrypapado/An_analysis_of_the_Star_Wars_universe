Instructed by [[G0-T0]], the [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] crime boss, Slusk came to Citadel Station over [[Telos IV]] to try and integrate the Exchange into the new Telos. Making an alliance with the [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]] brought the attention of [[Meetra Surik]], a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who happened to have a bounty on her head. When Slusk tried to collect the bounty, Surik resisted, and Slusk's operations almost came to an end.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|All Goto sees is numbers, and since Slusk keeps a steady flow of credits going, he keeps him around.|Luxa|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nAround [[3951 BBY]], Slusk was instructed by his boss, the [[Exchange]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[G0-T0]], to start a new Exchange cell on [[Citadel Station]]. After the planet [[Telos IV]] was bombarded by the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]], the massive Citadel Station had been constructed to serve as a home for displaced Telosians as well as a base for the [[Telosian Restoration Project]], a massive [[Terraforming/Legends|terraforming]] operation that would restore the surface of Telos.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref>\n\nThe farsighted Goto hoped that Slusk's cell could integrate themselves into the Telosian economy before it was reconstructed. Slusk was able to successfully establish an Exchange base on Citadel Station, using the legitimate front of the [[Bumani Exchange Corporation]] to act as the Exchange's legal face. He recruited several lieutenants, including [[Benok]] and [[Luxa]]. Before long, the Exchange began conducting a number of illegal operations over Telos, including illegal arms and spice smuggling, and controlling gambling outfits.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nDuring this time, Slusk made a deal with [[Jana Lorso]], [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]] representative on Citadel Station. Lorso was attempting to seize control of the Restoration project away from the peaceful [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorians]]. Slusk agreed to provide extra muscle for Czerka in an attempt to harass the Ithorians, in exchange for use of Czerka's private hangars to use in their illegal operations. This plan proved beneficial for both sides, until the arrival of [[Meetra Surik]].<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nOnly a short time prior to Surik's arrival on the station, Goto himself had posted a massive bounty on all [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. Slusk intended to capture Surik and transport her to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Surik was arrested by the [[Telos Security Force|TSF]], pending an investigation of the destruction of the [[Peragus Mining Facility]] (Surik was suspected of involvement). Slusk, utilizing one of Czerka's hangars, allowed an [[Batu Rem impostor|assassin posing as a TSF agent]] named [[Batu Rem]] to come aboard the station. The assassin took it from there, deactivating security cameras, etc. The assassin failed however, and Surik was later released.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nSurik obviously wanted to [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|make trouble]] on the station, and put a damper on Czerka's plan. Lorso contacted Slusk, and asked him to send a band of thugs to one of the dock modules and retrieve an information droid from the Ithorians. Slusk attempted to do so, but Surik had allied herself with the Ithorians and dispatched the assassins.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nSoon after, an illegally-modified blaster carried by one of her assailants, led Surik to [[Samhan Dobo]], the chief supplier of black market arms on Citadel Station. Surik subsequently shut down Samhan's operations with the help of the TSF, crippling a leg of Slusk's operations.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nThe final act of Surik against Slusk was the infiltration of his headquarters. Despite having informed his security personnel that no one representing the Ithorians was to be admitted, Surik nonetheless entered the offices of the Exchange. Slusk was confronted by Surik, claiming to have come representing [[Chodo Habat]], the leader of the Ithorians on Citadel Station. Enraged that Surik had been able to infiltrate his headquarters, Slusk ordered his chief-enforcer, Benok, to handle the Jedi.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nSurik killed Benok and his men, and followed Slusk to his quarters. Slusk, furious that the [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] guarding the door to his office had given Surik access, sent his [[Droid/Legends|droid]] bodyguards to destroy Surik, and shut his office tight.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nBut not even droids could stop the Jedi. Slusk, fearful for his life, asked Surik what she wanted. Surik simply told him that she wanted the Exchange to lay off the Ithorians. Slusk was surprised that Surik went to all the trouble for just a simple request, but the meeting was interrupted by Luxa. Suspicious, Slusk asked Luxa if she had been responsible for the Jedi's admittance. Luxa confirmed Slusk's suspicions, obviously intending to take power from Slusk, with the Jedi's help. The Jedi, however, tried not to get involved. Enraged that Surik would not help her as she had planned, Luxa attacked Surik, flanked by her Gamorrean bodyguards. Together, Slusk and Surik defeated Luxa's coup d'\u00e9tat.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n{{Quote|Why should I do this?\"<br />\"You've seen what I can do here, and know how much trouble I can make.''\"<br />\"''You have a good point; but I warn you, the Exchange is not bullied! If you push, expect to be pushed back!|Slusk and Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nSurik once again asked Slusk to lay off the Ithorians, claiming that she had proved she could make trouble for Slusk. The [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]], seeing the Jedi's proven strength, agreed to lay off the Ithorians, but warned Surik not to push the Exchange any further.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What's wrong with your boss?''\"<br />\"''What? You mean besides his being a typically slimy Quarren?|Meetra Surik and Luxa|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nSlusk was very much like most Quarren. He had little regard for the intelligence of others, considering himself to be superior. This arrogance caused him much trouble, as he not only underestimated Luxa's capability for betrayal, but also the abilities and powers of the Jedi. Nevertheless, Slusk was an adept businessman, and operated the operations on Citadel Station very well, pulling in a stable flow of credits. As such, Goto held Slusk in high regard, viewing successful Exchange bosses as superior to more ruthless ones, or more tactful.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nSlusk himself did not have a very large moral center, obviously due to his affiliation with an intergalactic crime syndicate. Nevertheless, Slusk was not above bribery or extortion, and did whatever he could to root the Exchange into Citadel Station, bribing officials, and assassinating other potentially troublesome targets. Slusk also did not tolerate foolishness, threatening to kill subordinates for allowing a representative of the Ithorians to enter the Exchange offices.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nSlusk also held his personal safety in very high regard, surrounding himself with a number of defenses for his own protection. Slusk was always flanked by two droid bodyguards, similar in construction to the [[Sentinel droid|war-droid series]]. The chamber outside his office was filled with ruthless Gamorrean guards. Beyond that, Benok usually had a few men stationed near the door when he was away. Benok himself was Slusk's \"chief of security\" (or in other words, top thug). Closer to home, Slusk had concealed turrets on either side of his desk.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nSlusk wore an array of gear, typical for most Quarren at the time. He wore long bluish-white robes, with a wide metal belt going across his torso, and a short brown cape behind him that fell to his lower back. Slusk also had a [[sonic pistol]], similar to other Quarren crime bosses, such as [[Saquesh]].<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlthough the above is considered the most [[canon]]ical [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light-side]] ending, the following options are available to the Exile.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nIf the Exile is working for the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorians]]:\n*Willingly team up with Slusk, not just out of necessity.\n**Spare Slusk at the end. (Light side)\n**Kill him at the end. (Dark side)\n*Team up with [[Luxa]] as planned.\n**Turn on Luxa after Slusk is dead. (Dark side)\n**Be turned on ''by'' Luxa.\n*Decide to kill both Slusk ''and'' Luxa. (Dark side)<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nAlternatively, the Exile, if on the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], can ally herself with [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka]], and attempt to kill Slusk for [[Jana Lorso]], to which Slusk feels betrayed. The scenario can be played similarly to the above encounter:<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n*Turn on Luxa, and join with Slusk.\n**Spare Slusk at the end. (Light side)\n**Kill Slusk for Lorso as planned. (Dark side)\n*Kill Slusk for Lorso as planned. (Dark side)\n**Be turned on ''by'' Luxa.\n**Turn on Luxa. (Dark side)\n*Decide to kill both Slusk ''and'' Luxa. (Dark side)\n*Try not to get involved. (Light side)\n**Turn on Slusk at the end. (Dark side)<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nIf you kill Slusk for Lorso, his men will retaliate by attacking the Czerka offices.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Loppak Slusk\n|ru=\u041b\u043e\u043f\u043f\u0430\u043a \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slusk, Loppak}}\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Quarren]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
