When Dest's father decided to leave, Dest chose to remain on the planet and eventually founded the [[Broken Columns Clan]], a tribe composed of men.\n\nUnder Dest's leadership, the Broken Columns Clan befriended the [[Raining Leaves Clan]], a clan of traditionalist [[Witches of Dathomir|Dathomiri Witches]]. The Broken Columns clan was the only tribe of men that did not attack the Raining Leaves Clan shortly after the [[Raining Leaves Clan massacre|massacre]] that befell their clan. The two tribes developed a custom where every year they would convene near [[Redgill Lake]] and form [[Marriage/Legends|marriages]] that lasted a year. After a few years the two clans decided to merge into one.\n\nIn [[43 ABY|43.5 ABY]], during the clan's annual [[Conclave of the Raining Leaves Clan and the Broken Columns Clan|conclave]], they suffered several attacks from the [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]].
