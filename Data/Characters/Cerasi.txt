It wasn't the result of time, of hours spent together. It wasn't the result of secrets or confidences. It was something else.''\"<br />\"''You loved her.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and [[Bant Eerin/Legends|Bant Eerin]]|Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple}}\n'''Cerasi''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who was one of the leaders of [[the Young]], a youth organization that brought a halt to the civil war between the [[Melida]] and the [[Daan (people)|Daan]] on the planet [[Melida/Daan]]. Her father was [[Wehutti]], a [[Melida]] leader. She also had a [[Cerasi's brother|brother]], who was sent to work in a munitions factory and whom she had not heard from since.\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the civil war, Cerasi met a Daan youth, [[Nield]], and together, the two decided to unite the Daan and the Melida orphans. They created an organization which would fight for peace, and were known as the Young. During the war, the group helped the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], and his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to rescue their fellow Jedi, [[Tahl]]. Later, Kenobi chose to stay and fight with the Young. Cerasi became very close friends with Kenobi during his stay on Melida/Daan; Kenobi would later say to [[Bant Eerin/Legends|Bant Eerin]] that he had loved her.\n\nUnder Nield and Cerasi's leadership, the group won the war and formed a government. Nield was elected as Melida/Daan's Governor, and established a new history squad that began to tear-down the [[Hall of Evidence|Halls of Evidence]]. Cerasi and Kenobi began to doubt the wisdom of destroying Melida/Daan's history, and moved to stop the destruction. Nield felt they had turned against him. The tension came to a peak when the elders and Nield's followers, both armed, converged on the halls of evidence. Kenobi and Cerasi arrived to try and stop the violence, but Cerasi, who was unarmed, was shot and killed by one of [[Mawat]]'s sharpshooters positioned on a nearby roof.\n\n===Attack on Wehutti===\nWhen [[Deila]], Obi-Wan, Cerasi and another Young warrior went to round up Wehutti (who was in fact Cerasi's father) and some Elders who wouldn't give away their weapons, Cerasi was told to wait outside. Deila, who was the Young's bomb expert, blasted away the door and the Young surged in, evenly matched with the Elders. Fortunately Cerasi had climbed up the side of the house and ambushed them from behind, earning the Young a victory.\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|I made my decision after the war ended; I will no longer carry a weapon. I will fight no more in the name of peace. But today I might die for it. Do me a favor, friends. Don't build any monuments for me. Don't destroy any either. History isn't in our favor, but that doesn't mean we should annihilate it. Don't let our dream of peace die. Work for it, don't kill for it. We fought one war for peace. We always said that one war had to be enough. Don't mourn too long for me. After all, I wanted peace. *shrug* Look at it this way, now I have it forever.|Cerasi|Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path}}\nBoth Nield and Obi-Wan Kenobi were deeply disturbed by Cerasi's death. Soon after, Qui-Gon Jinn returned to Melida/Daan and together with Kenobi, they investigated Cerasi's murder. The duo discovered that a member of the Young, named Mawat, had armed both sides, and placed sharpshooters at the scene, who had killed Cerasi. When Obi-Wan informed Nield of this, they left to try and stop the war being waged in Cerasi's name, although they were unable to halt the violence. Qui-Gon subsequently arrived and produced a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] of Cerasi speaking of peace. Cerasi had made the recording on her [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] shortly before her death. Qui-Gon was able to negotiate a cease-fire, and Nield was made one of the three planetary leaders.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCerasi was named after former [[LucasBooks]] editor [[Christopher Cerasi|Chris Cerasi]].<ref name=\"Chris Cerasi\">[http://forums.starwars.com/message.jspa?messageID=2975824#2975824 Chris Cerasi on the StarWars.com Message Boards]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Defenders of the Dead]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path]]''\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/fiction/f20080423/index.html|text=''Precipice''|int=Precipice|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-precipice.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|10|KEN2, ''Obi-Wan Kenobi''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|bg=\u041a\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\n|de=Cerasi#legends\n|es=Cerasi\n|ru=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Melida/Daan residents]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
