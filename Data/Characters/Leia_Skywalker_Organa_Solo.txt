Adopted into the [[House of Organa]], the [[Alderaanian]] [[King|royal]] family, she was [[Prince]]ss '''Leia Organa''' of [[Alderaan]], a [[planet]] in the [[Core Worlds]] known for its dedication to pacifism. The princess was raised as the daughter of [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa]] and his [[Marriage|wife]], Queen [[Breha Organa]], making her the heir to the [[Alderaanian monarchy]]. Instilled with the values of her adopted [[homeworld]], Organa devoted her life to the restoration of [[democracy]] by opposing [[Fascism|authoritarian]] regimes such as the [[Galactic Empire]] and the [[First Order]].\n\n[[Reproduction|Born]] in [[19 BBY]] as '''Leia Amidala Skywalker''', she was the [[DNA|biological]] offspring of the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo]]. Her birth occurred in the aftermath of the [[Clone Wars]], which saw the [[Jedi Order]] [[Great Jedi Purge|purged]] and the [[Galactic Republic]] [[Proclamation of the New Order|reorganized]] into the [[Galaxy|Galactic]] Empire. With her [[Parent|mother's]] [[death]] in childbirth and her father's fall to the [[dark side of the Force]], Leia and her [[twin]] brother [[Luke Skywalker]] were separated to keep them hidden from the [[Sith Lord]]s [[Darth Sidious]] and [[Darth]] Vader. As the adopted daughter of a politician, Leia Organa eventually succeeded Bail by representing their homeworld in the [[Imperial Senate]], though secretly she supported the Rebellion. During the [[Galactic Civil War]], however, Alderaan was [[The Disaster|destroyed]] along with its inhabitants and the royal family by the Empire's [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station]], causing Organa to openly fight the [[New Order]] as a leader of the Rebel Alliance.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Battle of Endor]], Organa [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa|married]] the [[Corellian]] [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] and learned the [[Jedi training|Jedi arts]] as her brother's [[Padawan|apprentice]] until giving birth to her son, [[Ben Solo]], on the [[Standard day|day]] of the Empire's [[Galactic Concordance|capitulation]] in [[5 ABY]]. Her personal and political life suffered in the [[Standard year|years]] that followed, with Ben turning to the dark side like his grandfather before him, adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, and the [[New Republic Senate|Galactic Senate]] sidelining Organa's career. Adopting the [[military rank]] of [[general]], she led the Resistance during the [[Cold War]] and sought to make amends with Ben. Despite her efforts, the First Order succeeded in [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroying]] the New Republic, and Organa's husband [[Battle of Starkiller Base|died]] at the hand of their estranged son in [[34 ABY]]. Organa continued to lead the Resistance during the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] against the First Order, all the while training [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]]&mdash;a Force-sensitive [[scavenger]] from [[Jakku]]&mdash;as a [[Jedi]].\n\nAs her health declined, Organa used her remaining strength to reach her son, calling him back to the [[light side of the Force]]. Following her death on [[Ajan Kloss]] in [[35 ABY]], the Resistance [[Battle of Exegol|defeated]] the [[Final Order|forces]] of the [[Cloning|reborn]] Darth Sidious's [[Sith Eternal]] on [[Exegol]], and inspired an [[uprising against the First Order]] across [[the galaxy]]. The heir to three inheritances, Leia Skywalker Organa Solo's legacy passed on to the Jedi Rey Skywalker, the military leader [[Poe Dameron]] of the Resistance, and Ben Solo, her only son, who ultimately returned to the light and sacrificed himself for Rey.\n\n==Biography==\n===Pre-birth===\n{{Quote|There is another&hellip;Skywalker.|Serenity|Sacrifice}}\nTowards the end of the [[Clone Wars]],<ref name=\"Sacrifice\">{{TCW|Sacrifice}}</ref> a [[the galaxy|galactic]] conflict fought between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] that was engineered by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]],<ref name=\"Episode III\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]] set out on a journey to discover the secrets of [[Force spirit|immortality]].

Ruling Alderaan would require giving up her freedom, her dignity, and even her private self in the service of a larger whole, but she worked hard to fulfill her parents' dreams for her and to be worthy of someday ruling her planet.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref>\n\nLeia was also reared by a number of [[Leia Organa's aunts|aunts]], who gave her etiquette lessons to turn her into a proper patrician,<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> and lectured her about maintaining her appearance and the company she kept.<ref name=\"Moving Target\" /> Although Leia genuinely loved them, she refused to let them mold her into a simpering princess whose only aim in life was to find a suitable husband.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> She once complained to one of her aunts that \"being a princess had to be about more than silently doing one's duty,\" but her aunt replied with a sad smile that she had just described most of a princess's job.<ref name=\"Moving Target\" />\n\nAt one point, Leia escaped from the care of her [[nanny droid]] and ran through the gardens of the [[Royal Palace of Alderaan|royal palace]] before finding her adoptive mother, Breha, reading in front of a statue of Leia's biological mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Staring up at the statue, Breha began to explain Amidala's long history, mesmerizing Leia. Breha began by explaining her start as an [[Apprentice Legislator]] in the [[Royal House of Naboo]] and the beginning of her long and arduous [[Politics|political]] career from a very young age. She went on to explain the hardships she had faced while serving the government of [[Naboo]], including her election as queen and the [[Invasion of Naboo]]<ref name=\"So Much More\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|annual=2019|story=[[So Much More]]}}</ref> in [[32 BBY]].<ref name=\"GA\" /> Calmly passing through her time as queen, Breha continued on by explaining that Amidala may have been a capable fighter on the battlefield, but the most important battles she ever fought were in the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]], using her words as her weapon as opposed to her [[blaster]], and that she would continue to fight in the Senate until lasting peace was brought to [[the galaxy]]. Finally, Breha explained that Amidala had been a beacon of hope for the entire galaxy and that even though she had passed on, her symbol, her spark, remained. Ending her speech, Breha finally came to the point of what she had wished to say to Leia, explaining that the spark of hope that Amidala had left upon the galaxy continued to live inside Leia, a spark that would one day reignite hope within the galaxy.<ref name=\"So Much More\" />\n\nIn [[10 BBY]], the nine-year-old princess ran away from the royal palace for the first time. She hid in the woods for a week until her parents' [[Alderaan guard|guards]] finally tracked her down. She would later remember that incident as the \"best week of her life.\"<ref name=\"SW33\">[[Star Wars (2015) 33|''Star Wars'' (2015) 33]]</ref>\n\nOnce warned to stay away from [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] by her father, the [[Grand Moff]] made an official visit to Alderaan when she was thirteen. Leia crept along the halls of the palace behind the two men, listening to their cold, tense conversation. During the occasion, she realized he was nothing more than a merciless murderer and [[Slavery|slaver]].<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" />\n\n====Learning skills====\n[[File:Princely_lessons.png|thumb|right|250px|The young princess developed combat skills and was fluent in several languages.]]\nIn Leia's teenage years, she learned to shoot with a [[Drearian Defense Conglomerate]] [[Defender sporting blaster pistol]], one often used by aristocrats of her social standing.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> Once she turned sixteen, Leia was allowed to receive some martial training with a personal instructor&mdash;her family had deemed necessary for her to learn the basics of self-defense, given her royal status and risk of abduction. She thoroughly enjoyed that training, which not only made her feel physically strong, but also allowed her to be released from the tension of her etiquette lessons. Thanks to her instructor, Leia learned to keep her mind clear and focused on the moment.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> She was also taught how to ride, even becoming an Alderaanian junior champion in steeple-chase.<ref name=\"Moving Target\" />\n\nOn one occasion, Leia was sparring against one of her family's servants outside the city, instead of being in [[language]] study, when her father picked her up. During their trip, she expressed her lack of enthusiasm in the politics her mother had to deal with, when the [[Viceroy]] explained to her what Alderaan meant, and what she would have to do one day as its queen&mdash;to carry on the legacy of Alderaan's harmonic culture with pride, even at the expense of what she wanted.<ref name=\"PL2\" /> Bail also told her tales of the Jedi, defenders of the old Republic; the young princess also overheard him talking of Darth Vader's [[Force power|powers]].<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" />\n\nIn her late teens, Leia followed her adoptive father's footsteps into politics, becoming a [[junior legislator]] by the age of fourteen.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Day of Demand====\n{{Quote|It is I, Leia Organa, princess of Alderaan. I come before you to hear you acknowledge that on this day it is known I have reached my sixteenth year.|Leia Organa|Leia, Princess of Alderaan}}\nOn her sixteenth birthday, it was Leia's [[Day of Demand]], which marked the day that the heir to the throne of House Organa would claim their right to it. Bail and Breha presented her with challenges to test her body, heart, and mind. Leia was to climb the [[Appenza Peak]], represent Alderaan in the [[Apprentice Legislature]] for [[junior senator]]s, and undertake charity missions to needy planets. Later, she met multiple senators, including [[Mon Mothma]]. Shortly after the ceremony, Leia undertook her first mission, where she traveled to [[Wobani]] to assist the population that was still suffering from the effects of the [[Commodities Enhancement Program]]. [[Captain]] [[Raymus Antilles]] accompanied her onboard the [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]''. After distributing supplies to the starving population, Leia decided to take as many refugees as she could back to Alderaan with them. She and [[Lieutenant]] [[Ress Batten]] spoke with Imperial [[Major]] [[Tedam]], who told her that she was not allowed to help the refugees. Undeterred, Leia hired around one hundred refugees and transported them back to Alderaan.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\">''[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan]]''</ref>\n\nOn their way back to Alderaan, the ''Tantive IV'' passed through the [[Bryx sector]]. Leia saw the damaged [[Calderos Station]], but before she could figure out who attacked it, [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]] ordered them to leave the sector. Little did she know, rebel forces working for her father had [[Attack on Calderos|attacked]] the outpost. When she returned to Alderaan, Breha welcomed the refugees, but when Leia asked her about Calderos, she was warned not to go near dangerous places.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\n====Serving in the Apprentice Legislature====\n{{Quote|For my Challenge of the Mind, I will no longer merely assist my father in the Imperial Senate but will also represent our world in the Apprentice Legislature.|Leia Organa|Leia, Princess of Alderaan}}\nLeia joined the [[Chandrilan Pathfinding Corps]] class led by [[Chief]] [[Pangie]] to train for her ascent of Appenza Peak. Her classmates were other junior senators [[Chassellon Stevis]], [[Harp Allor]], [[Sssamm Ashsssen]], [[Amilyn Holdo]], and [[Kier Domadi]], who also represented Alderaan. They practiced on the [[Rivoche Ranges]] on the planet [[Eriadu]] before traveling to Coruscant to participate in government matters. At one point, Tarkin came to meet the junior senators and was intrigued by Leia, noting her violation of Imperial rules on Wobani. Later, Leia learned her fellow Alderaanian junior senator Kier Domadi had taken place in Clone Wars reenactments, which was illegal under Imperial law. Later, during a debate over the location of a new [[Imperial Academy]], Leia successfully argued for the planet [[Arreyel]].<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\n====Discovering a rebellion====\nAfter making connections between hyperspace routes between Calderos Station and multiple nearby planets, and Arkanis, Leia attempted to discover the means of the attack on Calderos by investigating the mining world of [[Crait]]. She and Batten traveled to the planet in the royal [[yacht]] ''[[Polestar]]''. Upon their arrival, Leia was immediately detained by a group of what appeared to be insurgents, but once they learned she was the Princess of Alderaan, they brought her to their campsite, where Leia discovered Bail was operating a [[Crait outpost|rebel base]]. Leia was shocked to learn that her father was operating an underground rebel group and was responsible for the attack on Calderos Station. Bail was equally shocked that despite the erased data, his daughter was able to track him. Bail and his personal [[diplomat|diplomatic]] [[cruiser]] ''[[Tantive III]]'' escorted the ''Polestar'' home, and Leia erased the data upon Bail's request. He and Breha, who also helped run their operation, forbid Leia to talk about or become involved with their anti-Imperial efforts.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\n====Humanitarian missions====\nContinuing her humanitarian work, Leia and Batten traveled to [[Onoam]], one of [[Naboo]]{{'s}} [[moon]]s. Leia met with [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Daln\u00e9]], who welcomed the opportunity for Leia to try to fix the massive strikes by the local [[miner|workers]] who toiled in the [[Onoam mine]]s. Leia met with [[Brel Ti Vorne]], a representative for the miners, to whom Leia gifted five hundred sets of supplies, each consisting of safety belts, atmosphere masks, portable force fields that can purify air, and other safety gear. However, Ti Vorne told Leia that they could not accept the gifts because their Imperial overseers had been confiscating their equipment and selling it for profit. An outraged Leia arranged to meet with [[Moff]] [[Quarsh Panaka]], who invited her and Queen Daln\u00e9 to his [[Quarsh Panaka's chalet|chalet]] to discuss the issue over [[tea]]. Inside, Panaka noticed Leia looked like the late Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom Panaka had been very close with.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\nPanaka vowed to find the Imperial officials responsible, and then began to question Leia about her mother and father. When Leia revealed that she was almost exactly sixteen and adopted, Panaka realized that she could be the Queen's daughter. However, Leia, who was embarrassed by Panaka's prying questions, opted to leave, but after a few steps outside the chalet a massive explosion destroyed the office, killing Panaka and throwing Leia and Daln\u00e9 to the ground. Leia witnessed a miner in a breathing mask fleeing the scene. [[Stormtrooper]]s secured the area and treated Leia and Daln\u00e9 for minor injuries.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\nSoon after, Leia undertook another diplomatic mission to the sickened world of [[Chal Hudda]]. As [[Disease/Legends|diseases]] ravaged the [[swamp|swampy]] planet, Leia delivered vaccines to the ailing population. The [[Chalhuddan]] leader, [[Occo Quentto]], at first refused the vaccines, but then agreed to take them by making a deal with Leia, wanting help not from 'saviors' but from equals. He agreed to do Leia a favor in the near future.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\nLeia would learn of the fate of Arreyel, the planet she lobbied to receive the next Imperial Academy. Imperial engineers had discovered a radiation source within the mantle of the planet, and Emperor Palpatine had given the population six weeks to evacuate without compensation so the energy could be used to power planet-wide Imperial factories. Compounding Leia's frustration, the Apprentice Legislatures received a special commendation for recommending Arreyel.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\nThen, Leia and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]] brought relief to the planet [[Chasmeene]], which was suffering after being punished for failing to meet Imperial quotas. They brought food, seeds, and agricultural equipment to help restart the economy. Leia went a step further by collecting evidence to prove the Empire had committed crimes against the people of Chasmeene.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\n====First actions as a rebel====\nLeia would soon discover her parents were building a [[Rebel Alliance Navy|fleet]] over the planet [[Paucris Major]]. Bail forced Leia to swear an oath of secrecy before she accompanied him to Coruscant to serve as his senatorial aide. During her duties, she once again ran into Grand Moff Tarkin. Tarkin bragged to Leia about Imperial security forces, including noting the Empire was trying to achieve peace in the Paucris System. Realizing Tarkin was telling her that they had discovered rebel forces in the system, Leia raced to warn her father, but when she was unable to contact him, she contacted Breha and Mon Mothma. After telling them, Mothma told Leia to go to Paucris Major and warn them of an impending attack. However, the ''Polestar'' was on Alderaan, so Mothma gave Leia [[credit]]s to hire a ship.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\nLeia ran into Stevis and Holdo at the spaceport trying to hire the ''[[Mighty Oak Apocalypse]]'' to take them to a [[speeder]] auction on [[Arkanis]]. Holdo, who was suspicious of Leia's rebel connections, convinced Stevis to stay behind and allowed Leia to hire the ''Mighty Oak Apocalypse'' to travel to the planet [[Pamarthe]]. Leia explained her mission to Holdo, who understood the importance of helping her friend and joined her. However, once they arrived on Pamarthe, they learned that a storm was preventing all ships from leaving the planet. Thinking fast, Leia found a Chalhuddan ship. She tells them to contact Occo Quentto, who told his men to bring them to Paucris Major to repay his debt to her.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\nThey arrived in the Paucris System and Leia broadcast a message to the rebels, telling them that Tarkin had discovered them. The rebels began to [[Evacuation of Paucris Major|evacuate]] their [[Rebel base (Paucris)|base]] and initiated [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct]] protocols on the [[orbit|orbital]] landers to destroy all evidence. As the ships began to jump away, until Leia and Holdo were the only ones left to witness a concerned Domadi arriving in the system in a [[starcutter]] civilian transport. Unfortunately, he landed at the platform, unaware that it was about to self-destruct. He was mortally wounded when the platforms exploded. Leia flew their ship over to save him but it was too late. He died as in Leia's arms. Then, an Imperial ship arrived, and Holdo pretended they were an astrological survey group, convincing the Imperials to let them go.

She was greeted by [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]], who were respectively disguised as a stormtrooper and an [[Imperial cadet]], as well as [[Lieutenant]] [[Yogar Lyste]], who knew that Leia often had a large majority of her ships become \"stolen\" by rebel agents. Consequently, Lyste implemented stricter security measures against what he assumed was another \"meddling delegation from Alderaan,\" ultimately complicating her plan to transfer the cruisers to the rebels by placing [[gravity lock]]s on the ships, along with ordering two [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-ATs]] to guard them.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>\n\nLeia then requested she use Lyste's [[Sentinel-class landing craft|shuttle]], and she flew with Kanan and Ezra to former [[Governor]] [[Ryder Azadi]]'s hideout.

On board, Leia bonded with Ezra after learning he had recently lost his parents, assuaging his fears the rebellion might not be worth fighting. They then resolved to find a way to steal the corvettes.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nStill disguised, Kanan and Ezra used the ''[[Phantom]]'' to escort Leia back to the depot, distracting a surprised Lyste while Ryder, [[Sabine Wren]], and [[C1-10P]] disabled the gravity locks and commandeered the ships. During the ensuing firefight, she saw Kanan use his [[Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber|lightsaber]] to down an AT-AT, and Ezra use [[telekinesis]] to disarm a pair of stormtroopers, which gave her the opportunity to grab one of the [[E-11 blaster rifle|rifles]] and use it against the troopers. When Ezra boarded the last corvette, she ordered him to make it appear they were struggling and [[stun]] her.

As the group passed a doorway, the [[Mandalorian]] rebel Sabine Wren distracted the troopers with a yellow paint bomb and kidnapped the princess via a lasso. Before the stormtroopers realized what had happened, Wren shut the gate. Inside the gate, Sabine introduced herself to Leia and told her that she had been sent to \"capture\" her and collect a data tape valuable to the rebellion.

Her aunts protested and argued that she'd be better off finding a prince for husband, whereas the press claimed she was a \"princess playing dress-up\" and not a real [[diplomat]] and politician. Spending the days leading up to her election listing out her grievances, intent on addressing the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] directly and bluntly, Leia was presented by her father to Emperor [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] on [[Coruscant]], with all the newly elected officials. However, when she met the Imperial ruler, she was frightened by his disturbing aura of evil that she was left speechless and dropped into a half-curtsy. At some point, Organa met the Emperor's [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] and enforcer, Darth Vader (both unaware that they were biological father and daughter), and dealt with him.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> In her early days at the Senate, Organa discovered that betrayal always came from those who acted the friendliest.<ref name=\"HttJ\">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>\n\nDespite her sincere desire for real change and reform, Organa soon realized that no other senator seemed to share her ideals,<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> as the Senate had become a mere ceremonial institution that sycophantically validated Palpatine's every decree,<ref name=\"Tarkin\">[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']]</ref> and no delegate ever dared test the Emperor's patience. Unable to understand how the other senators could ignore the Empire's crimes in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], Organa devoted herself to aid the suffering all across the galaxy. On one occasion, she rescued an orphaned baby [[Wookiee]] from the ruins of a village destroyed by Imperial forces. Yet, to her annoyance, the media continued to reduce her to the label of princess, paying no attention to her humanitarian work.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" />\n\nEventually, Leia's leadership and diplomatic skills made the public come to care about her, enough that any whisper of mistreatment would \"set the [[HoloNet]] on fire.\"<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> During her tenure as an Imperial senator, Organa had to deal with the [[Givin]], a mathematically inclined species.

This was just a few days after she delivered a speech in the Senate about increasing Alderaan's mercy missions to outlying systems the Empire had forgotten or neglected. Despite her popularity, her speech received mixed criticisms, as many in the Core Worlds believed that the Empire was already providing the necessary aid and that Alderaan's \"meddling\" was becoming too important. During the ball, Organa danced with [[Imperial Academy|Imperial]] [[cadet]] [[Thane Kyrell]]; he, however, noticed she was paying little attention to him, likely because she was distracted and had a lot on her mind. <ref name=\"LS\">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====A diplomatic mission====\n{{Quote|Your Highness.

Darth Vader led a boarding party onto the ship and massacred the entire squadron, but not before a [[Unidentified fleet trooper|fleet trooper]] handed the disc off to another man, [[Toshma Jefkin]]. He barely escaped Vader and got aboard the ''[[Tantive IV]]'', which promptly detached from the ''Profundity'' and fled from the battle, setting a course for Tatooine with the plans for the superweapon.

As Organa came to, she attempted to resist against the stormtroopers, but Lareka forced her into a pair of [[stun cuffs]] and threatened to blast her again. Before she was escorted to Vader, Lareka spontaneously removed his [[Stormtrooper armor|helmet]] and locked eyes with Organa, reminding her that the troopers she fought were flesh and blood.

Nevertheless, Organa was locked away in [[Cell 2187]], a small room that she unsuccessfully attempted to find an escape from. Although he technically had no proof that the princess was affiliated with the Rebel Alliance, Vader was more than certain of her deception and returned to her cell with an [[IT-O Interrogation Unit]], an [[interrogator droid]] equipped with a powerful [[mind probe]]. Organa was submitted to the droid's [[truth serum]], a drug that painfully invaded her mind in an effort to root out the location of the Rebel base.

Now aware of her people's situation, she enlisted both Verlaine and R2-D2's help for a self-imposed [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to save the survivors of Alderaan. With the astromech, she recorded a decoy hologram of herself, and sent it to Dodonna's quarters during the night, to apologize for disobeying his orders. Meanwhile, the trio made their escape from Yavin on [[Jan Dodonna's T-1 shuttle|a]] [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|T-1 shuttle]], but as they departed, they were pursued by Skywalker and [[Wedge Antilles]] on their [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighters]].<ref name=\"PL1\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_confronts_Junn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Princess Leia confronted Lord Junn, a friend to the House of Organa, after he betrayed her.]]\nNevertheless, Verlaine outsmarted them and made the jump to Naboo,<ref name=\"PL1\" /> and landed on its [[capital]], [[Theed]]. Posing as Imperial [[auditor]]s, they came across a mural of the late Padm\u00e9 Amidala (who unbeknownst to her, was her biological mother), and Organa momentarily saw the images' head turn to look at her, in what she dismissed as an illusion. They were soon approached by Lord [[Junn]], her old friend, who invited them to [[Junn's palace|his villa]]. Organa requested that Junn arrange their meeting with [[Mul Sanaka]], owner of [[Club Deeja]] in [[Keren]], and employer of the [[Melodic Order]]\u2014the cloister of Alderaanian [[musician]]s they were looking for. When he did so, Organa, Verlaine, and R2-D2 made their way to the club and met Sanaka, with whom they tried to negotiate over the Alderaanians.<ref name=\"PL2\" />\n\nHowever, Sanaka and his [[Besalisk]] guards tried to capture them, already aware of her identity. As Organa and her companions resisted, Sanaka attempted to kill her, foiled only by the intervention of [[Uwa Pareece]], the Melodic Order's leader, who had been discreetly following the princess. Organa then had her lead them to the Order, whom she invited to follow her on her crusade. Once they agreed, Organa returned to Junn's palace, and made him explain why he had betrayed them to Sanaka. Finally, Organa demanded a [[Luxury yacht/Legends|luxury yacht]] with enough capacity to relocate the Melodic Order, and he agreed to give her the ''[[Lord Junn]]''. Soon thereafter, the gathered Alderaanians departed for [[Sullust]] in the Outer Rim.<ref name=\"PL2\" />\n\n====Alderaan's survival====\n{{Quote|We're not our enemy. We are Alderaan.

During the journey, an Alderaanian [[rifle]] [[squad]] tried to apprehend them, but Organa and her companions quickly disarmed them, and requested to see their leader, [[Preserver]] [[Jora Astane]], who refused to submit to Organa's authority. She suspected her to be a traitor&mdash;particularly so after the replay of one of her ships' transmissions: [[Tace]]'s innocent disclosing of their location to her sister, [[Tula]], an Imperial under the watchful eye of [[Commander]] [[Dreed]].<ref name=\"PL3\">[[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Leia_arrives_Alderaan_Enclave.png|thumb|left|220px|Organa and Verlaine entered the Alderaan Enclave together on Sullust.]]\nLearning that [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|Dreed's Imperial cruiser]] had entered Sullust's [[orbit]], Astane ordered her men to kill Organa and Verlaine, forcing the two to escape into a polluted [[water]]way beneath the [[Eyewell]]. From there, they herded [[rockrender]]s to attack stormtroopers in the battle against the Alderaanians in the Enclave above. Once the skirmish was over, and the Imperials had been defeated, Astane finally accepted Organa as their sovereign.<ref name=\"PL3\" />\n\nOn her request, [[Nien Nunb]] successfully led the Alderaanian survivors off of Sullust, and Organa awarded him [[chalcedony waves]] from her late mother, only for Astane and [[Covis]] to bring Tace before her. Organa discussed the problem with Tace over some [[tea]]; knowing her to be innocent, Organa decided to draw her sister out. She then appointed Pareece and Astane to negotiate with the Alderaanians living in [[Espirion]], and had Tace ask Tula about her location. The plan backfired when Dreed threatened to kill Tula because of the inquiry, prompting Organa to trade herself for Tula on [[Skaradosh]], where she met Dreed as she placed herself back in Imperial custody.<ref name=\"PL4\">[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]]</ref> The Imperials were soon attacked by a group of her followers, including Verlaine and Nunb, before she could board Dreed's shuttle.

She also witnessed Tace and Tula's reunion, just before meeting with Pareece and Astane to talk about their failed mission to the planet below. This angered Organa, as she had been counting on Espirion's military support against the incoming Star Destroyer, but after Verlaine's encouraging words, Organa sent an inspiring message to her fleet&mdash;which R2-D2 retransmitted to the Alderaanians below, prompting [[Beon Beonel]] to send the ''[[Espirion Multi]]'' to destroy Dreed's [[cruiser]].<ref name=\"PL5\" />\n\nAfter a celebration held among the surviving Alderaanians, Organa told Verlaine of her return to the Alliance, given she had never intended to abandon it forever, for their people would never be safe as long as the Emperor was in control. Verlaine claimed they needed their princess, but Organa suggested that she should elect one then, appointing Verlaine as her would-be successor. Ultimately, Organa and R2-D2 returned to Yavin 4, where she reunited with Skywalker, Solo, Chewbacca, and C-3PO.<ref name=\"PL5\" />\n\n====Mission to Tibrin====\nOrgana and Skywalker undertook a mission to [[Tibrin]] with [[Liddle]] and [[Tadd]]. Posing as diplomats from [[Naboo]]'s [[House Berenko]], they were allowed to land in the capital of Tibrin. They were greeted by [[Mariod]] [[Govi]], and they discussed the possibility of the [[Ishi Tib]] and Rebel Alliance working together. Suddenly, a squadron of stormtroopers attacked, and the Rebels tried to hold off the Imperials. A grenade knocked out Skywalker, and Organa fell from a platform but managed to hold on to the ledge. Organa could only watch as the stormtroopers dragged Skywalker onto their shuttle and flew away.<ref name=\"SWA 4\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=4|story=[[The Trouble at Tibrin]]}}</ref>\n\nDisguised as an Imperial officer transferred from the ''Malevolence'' to the ''[[Stormbringer]]'', Organa snuck aboard the ship on which Skywalker was held captive. Using an explosion in the hangar, she took the clearance card of a stormtrooper and used it to find out where Skywalker was being held. She then crawled through ventilation shafts to come to Skywalker's position. Just before he was going to get tortured, Organa appeared and stunned the Imperials holding him. When they escaped they had no place to run, as there were Imperials everywhere. Skywalker convinced Organa to trust him, and together they got into an escape pod which they launched towards Tibrin. Just as the ''Stormbringer'' was about to fire on the pod, [[Marsheem-class heavy cruiser|''Marsheem''-class heavy cruisers]] appeared from Tibrin's moon and attacked the ''Stormbringer'', destroying it completely.

During her stay on the ''[[Redemption]]'', Organa suggested to Ackbar and [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] that they sent someone to open a secret supply of weapons for the Alliance with the [[Chekkoo clan]] of [[Rodia]], a [[Mission to Rodia (Luke Skywalker)|mission]] for which Skywalker volunteered.<ref name=\"HttJ\" />\n\nFollowing his return from Rodia, Organa and Ackbar met with Skywalker as soon as he landed the ''[[Desert Jewel]]'' on the ''[[Promise]]'' to talk about his [[Skirmish over Llanic|encounter]] over [[Llanic]], during which he had saved a [[Kupohan]] ship from Imperial attack. Though he apologized for it, Organa revealed he had done the right thing, as the ship carried vital intelligence about a Givin [[cryptologist]] from [[Denon]], [[Drusil Bephorin]], willing to help the Alliance, if the Rebels were able to safely transport her and her family to [[Omereth]]. Organa and Ackbar assigned Skywalker, [[Nakari Kelen]] and the ''Desert Jewel'' to the [[Mission on Denon|mission]], though Organa warned Skywalker not to trust blindly on Kelen. After their return from a [[Mission to Fex|errand]] for Kelen's [[Fayet Kelen|father]] and the ''Jewel''{{'s}} modifications, Organa and Ackbar further debriefed Skywalker and Kelen, and she specifically instructed them to greet Bephorin with maths to earn her trust.<ref name=\"HttJ\" />\n\n====The Dragon Void Run====\n{{Quote|Don't give up hope just yet. If there's one thing I'm sure of... Han Solo is a survivor. And he'll survive this.|Leia Organa to Airen Cracken|Han Solo 3}}\nSome time after the outpost was established on Reamma, Organa sent rebel operatives [[Adame]] and [[Selentia]] after Solo and Chewbacca with a specific mission in mind for the smugglers. Leia sent a holographic message to Solo, telling him that the Alliance needed his ship and that there would be a reward.<ref name=\"HS1\">[[Han Solo 1|''Han Solo'' 1]]</ref>\n\nRejecting the idea, Han confronted Leia on a rebel frigate. The two argued about the fact that she wanted to use his ship. As the duo continued to argue as they made their way through a hallway, General [[Airen Cracken]], the head of Security and Intelligence for the Rebel Alliance, intercepted them. Cracken was unsure about Solo and the mission in general. Organa, however, vouched for him, even telling the general that he could do the mission himself. Although Cracken was hesitant, he agreed with Leia. They informed Solo of the mission, which was to find rebel informants, find a mole within the ranks, and prevent them from being murdered. They told him of the legendary [[Dragon Void Run]], a dangerous race that made its way to three planets, each of which had a rebel informant on it. Due to the race's legendary status, Solo agreed. In order to make his reason for leaving convincing, Leia punched Han in the face, telling him to never come back. Solo and his co-pilot left the Alliance frigate and made their way to the race.<ref name=\"HS1\" />\n\nWhen Solo and Chewbacca arrived on the [[Unidentified planet (Dragon Void Run)|first planet]], Solo was promptly arrested by Imperial authorities. Organa and Cracken watched this on a viewscreen. Although Cracken thought the mission was compromised, Leia called Han a \"survivor,\" knowing that he could get out of this situation. Chewbacca, however, found the first informant, a [[Duros]] named [[Bot (Duros)|Bot]]. However, Solo was let go by the Imperials, and the race continued.<ref name=\"HS3\">[[Han Solo 3|''Han Solo'' 3]]</ref>\n\nSolo and Chewbacca continued the race and met another informant, [[Dorae]], on the second planet. After making their way to the third planet, the duo found the final informant, an [[Elomin]] by the name of [[Aran (Elomin)|Aran]], and his bodyguard, a [[Falleen]] named [[U'Il]]. When they left the third planet, everyone but the Elomin made their way to the cockpit. As Solo continued to race, the group found Aran murdered.<ref name=\"Han Solo 4\">[[Han Solo 4|''Han Solo'' 4]]</ref> Through deduction, Han realized that it was Bot who had committed to crime under the influence of brainwashing. The Duros was subdued and the race was finished. Solo and Chewbacca brought the remaining informants back to the Alliance. It was revealed that the bodyguard U'Il was the informant carrying a master list with names the rebellion needed to keep safe. She gave the list to Organa. She and Solo talked about him staying with the rebellion longer than he initially thought he would.<ref name=\"Han Solo 5\">[[Han Solo 5|''Han Solo'' 5]]</ref>\n\n====Attack on Cymoon 1====\n{{Quote|Remind me never to attack another weapons factory.|Leia Organa|Star Wars (2015) 3}}\nAlongside Skywalker, Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO,<ref name=\"SW1\">[[Star Wars (2015) 1|''Star Wars'' (2015) 1]]</ref> Organa led<ref name=\"Star Wars 2\" /> a [[Assault on Cymoon|mission]] on the Imperial [[factory]] world of [[Cymoon 1]], where they would infiltrate and destroy [[Weapons Factory Alpha]]. After capturing a shuttle whose passenger was an emissary of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] sent to negotiate with the Empire on shipping raw materials from [[Hutt Space|Hutt-controlled space]] to Imperial facilities, Organa and Skywalker disguised themselves as [[bodyguard]]s to escort Solo (who, they agreed, would pose as the envoy) with R2-D2 into the factory. Greeted by [[Overseer (assignment)|Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]], they entered the facility only to reveal themselves as rebels and incapacitate Aggadeen's stormtroopers, with the Overseer revealing the [[Reactor|power core's]] location, before Organa knocked him out as well.<ref name=\"SW1\" />\n\n[[File:To_the_main_power_core.png|thumb|left|220px|The Rebels make their way to the main power core.]]\nOnce the four made their way to the central power station, Organa, Solo, and R2-D2 rigged the power core. As they awaited Skywalker's return, Organa thanked the [[Corellia]]n [[smuggler]] for taking such a risk for the Alliance, yet questioned Solo about whether he had an ulterior motive for doing so. Their conversation was interrupted by Skywalker's arrival with Imperial slaves. Though Organa was unsure of Skywalker's decision and determination to have the slaves escape with them, Solo accepted it and prompted them to escape the facility as soon as possible.<ref name=\"SW1\" />\n\nWhen they were alerted by Chewbacca of Vader's arrival, Organa ordered the Wookiee to kill the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] even at the expense of them, blaming him for Alderaan's destruction. However, Vader sensed danger and protected himself from Chewbacca's shot, putting the entire moon on alert of their presence. Completely surrounded and having lost contact with Chewbacca, they came across a [[hangar]], and, though Organa noticed Skywalker's absence, she and Solo procured an [[All Terrain Armored Transport (Galactic Civil War)|All Terrain Armored Transport]] [[walker]] for themselves, just as Skywalker engaged Vader in [[Lightsaber combat|combat]].<ref name=\"SW1\" />\n\n[[File:Han_Leia_argue_at-at.png|thumb|right|250px|Han and Leia argue while escaping the factory aboard the stolen AT-AT.]]\nOrgana, Solo, R2-D2, and several slaves boarded the AT-AT, and Solo piloted it through the factory before stepping on a subterranean corridor, almost crushing Skywalker and Vader. Once Solo almost stepped on a [[Twi'lek]] slave, Organa called him out on it, but he claimed only wanting to get them out of there, while R2-D2 and a pair of [[Jawa]]s worked to have its [[cannon]]s operational. Though the Sith Lord almost tore the walker apart with the Force, the astromech droid informed them that the cannons were ready, and Organa hit the button to fire. They not only temporarily incapacitated Vader, but also blasted their way out of the facility.<ref name=\"Star Wars 2\" />\n\nOnce outside, their walker only received more blaster fire; Organa, then, realized the Imperials had stopped the reactor's meltdown, and Vader caught up with them and destroyed the walker's legs with [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|his]] [[lightsaber]], throwing it off. From the rubble, Organa carried Solo and led the slaves to safety, when Skywalker met with her and told her he would finish their mission. Disobeying Organa's orders, Skywalker used his stolen [[speeder bike]] to destroy the power core. Soon enough, they made their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and barely escaped with their lives. On the ship, she thanked Skywalker for completing the mission, trying to encourage him, but his morale was at rock bottom.<ref name=\"SW3\">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref> Before long, the ''Falcon'' rendezvoused with the Rebel fleet.<ref name=\"SW4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\n====An estranged wife====\n{{Quote|And here I thought ''one'' Solo was bad.

Having thought him dead, Leia was surprised. Organa had R2-D2 activate an ion pulse, which took out the prison's gravity, as well as the trigger to the thermal detonators. Ray and Organa began fighting in midair. Through the combined efforts of Leia, Aphra, and Sana, Ray was defeated and arrested.<ref name=\"SW 19\">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the remaining staff and prisoners were evacuated. However, Doctor Aphra escaped, thanks to the indifference of Organa and Starros. As Ray was escorted in binders, Leia told him that she hadn't given up on him. However, Ray was so broken mentally that he told her that the rebels had no chance of winning, and that she would eventually wish she had listened to him.<ref name=\"SW 19\" />\n\n====Temporary outpost====\n{{Quote|It's absolute ''chaos'' in here, Luke. We're still trying to get on our feet here and one of our cargo vessels is still ''missing''.|Leia Organa to Luke Skywalker|Droid Dilemma}}\nSome time later the Rebel Alliance established a temporary outpost by the name of [[LX-Robynsun V]] on the Outer Rim planet [[Reamma]]. The Alliance was still adjusting to the new outpost when a cargo vessel went missing. Leia assigned Skywalker to double back and search for it, as it was carrying vital medical supplies and other cargo. However, as Skywalker and R2-D2 prepared the search, the cargo vessel arrived, cancelling the mission.<ref name=\"Droid Dilemma\">{{Shortstory|story=Droid Dilemma|book=Star Wars (2015) 25|bformatted=''Star Wars'' 25|manual=1}}</ref>\n\n====Hijacking of the ''Harbinger''====\nOrgana and Skywalker attended a meeting with Jan Dodonna, Gial Ackbar, and Mon Mothma aboard a [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|medical frigate]]. Ackbar reported that the planet of [[Tureen VII]] was under [[Siege on Tureen VII|siege]] from the Empire. The planet had been providing aid to the rebellion secretly, and it was considered time for the Alliance to repay their debts to Tureen VII. The high-ranking members noted that the planet had come under a blockade, with the people of the world starving. After three attempts to break through the Imperial blockade failed, Skywalker and Organa came up with the idea to steal a Star Destroyer to infiltrate the blockade and provide relief to the people of Tureen VII. Although General Dodonna was initially hesitant, due to the large crew needed for operating such a vehicle, Leia asked for as much crew as could be spared. Due to the high rank of Organa and Skywalker, they were given permission to go through with this mission.<ref name=\"SW 23\">[[Star Wars (2015) 23|''Star Wars'' (2015) 23]]</ref>\n\nAfter the meeting, Leia took the ''Millennium Falcon'', along with Han Solo, Chewbacca, Sana Starros, R2-D2, and C-3PO to attack the Star Destroyer known as the [[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|''Harbinger'']]. Luke took the pilots of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] to also engage in the assault. The ''Falcon'' was used to fire proton bombs at an area near the Destroyer's main engine reactor. [[Red Three]], Wedge Antilles, also fired torpedoes towards the main engine reactor. Although the shots hit their mark, the reactor did not overload. Skywalker flew into the main engine reactor in an attempt to overload it, which succeeded. The Imperial crew of the Star Destroyer abandoned ship, giving the crew of the ''Millennium Falcon'' the opportunity to capture it. The ship flew into the Destroyer's hangar, with the crew of the ''Falcon'' attacking the ship from the inside. Meanwhile, Skywalker secured the reactor room as the sentients made their way there. As a [[Realspace|space]] battle raged outside, an explosion came from the ''Harbinger'', making the Empire think it had been destroyed.<ref name=\"SW22\">[[Star Wars (2015) 22|''Star Wars'' (2015) 22]]</ref>\n\nA week afterwards, a patrol of two TIE fighters briefly spotted the stolen Star Destroyer, but were quickly destroyed. Skywalker noted that the Empire may have known their location. However, Organa stated that if the government had known, there would have been more ships sent. At the time, the Destroyer was running on its secondary reactor and had no captain. Solo and Organa argued about who was to be the captain. Skywalker attempted to calm the duo by telling them of the situation at hand, noting that it would most likely be the last flight of the ''Harbinger''.<ref name=\"SW22\" />\n\nDays later, a reactor overload was becoming more and more likely. Luke, R2-D2, and Chewbacca were attempting to fix the issue as quickly as possible. However, an explosion occurred, and the astromech droid jettisoned the reactor, allowing the Star Destroyer to go to hyperspace. Han noted that the group had officially stolen their own Star Destroyer, with Leia responding that the hard part was yet to come.<ref name=\"SW 23\" />\n\nAfter the ''Harbinger'' got out of hyperspace, the engines died. Chewbacca attempted to fix the the backup reactor in order for the Destroyer to simply get to Tureen VII. Solo attempted to order the crew to change course to the [[Monsua Nebula]] in order to give the crew more time to fix it. However, Organa ordered the crew to belay that order, knowing that the people of Tureen VII were dying and there was not enough time to stop and make repairs. The duo continued to argue about the merits of their ideas and who should be temporary captain of the ship. Solo proposed a race to the bridge of the Destroyer to determine who was to be the captain. Although Leia seemed to think that was a bad idea, she kicked Solo in the shin as a way to give herself a head start.<ref name=\"SW 23\" />\n\nAs the two made their way through a hangar, Solo rode a speeder bike as a way to get a lead on Organa. After being hit by the bike, Leia asked a member of the crew where the spacesuits were kept. She later donned one of the spacesuits and made her way to the bridge, getting there before Solo and declaring herself captain. As she was doing that, a rebel shuttle with the dead Admiral [[Verette]] tied to the front. Sana Starros destroyed the ship, thinking it was a trap. Meanwhile, an Imperial shuttle carrying [[Task Force 99]] managed to sneak onto the Star Destroyer and board it.<ref name=\"SW 23\" />\n\nAfterwards, Solo noted that the Star Destroyer's hyperdrive, backup reactor, shields, and ion cannons were all malfunctioning in some form, calling the ''Harbinger'' \"the worst Star Destroyer in the entire galaxy.\" Organa wanted to know the status of the ion cannons, asking the Destroyer's maintenance team what the status was. Due to the fact that the team had gone missing, a group led by Luke and Sana went to check it out. Han still wanted the ''Harbinger'' to stop for repairs, but considering all the options, Leia pressed on. Noting that the situation was ludicrous, Organa told Solo that she wanted him as the Destroyer's helmsman, calling him \"the craziest pilot in the galaxy.\"<ref name=\"SW24\">[[Star Wars (2015) 24|''Star Wars'' (2015) 24]]</ref>\n\nAs this conversation took place, Starros and Skywalker found Task Force 99 in the hallways of the ship. The squadron proceeded to attack Skywalker's group. Luke engaged the leader, Sergeant [[Kreel]], while Starros and the other members of the group dealt with other members of the squadron. Organa and Solo, meanwhile, were defending the bridge from the members [[Aero]], [[Misty]], and [[Mic]]. Solo steered the ''Harbinger'' towards Tureen VII, ramming it into the planet's base security Star Destroyers. As a result, the Destroyer's front shields and an engine were lost. The Rebel Alliance sent [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]] to defend the Star Destroyer, and as they engaged the base's TIE fighters, Darth Vader arrived in his [[Darth Vader's TIE Advanced|own]] [[TIE Advanced x1|personal TIE fighter]], destroying many of the Alliance X-wings.<ref name=\"SW24\" />\n\nOrgana ordered Red Squadron to defend the ''Harbinger'' in order to give the Star Destroyer more time to release the supplies to the surface of Tureen VII. Solo attempted to get the Destroyer's ion cannons online. Han and Leia attempted to hold the bridge, to no avail. Meanwhile, Skywalker engaged Sergeant Kreel, eventually using the Force to disable him. Later, the reactors came back to full power when Chewbacca tossed Task Force 99 member [[Zuke]] into the reactor. Although the reactor power was restored, the controls specifically were disabled. R2-D2 was flying the ship remotely and operating the ion cannons because of that. Meanwhile, Starros and Chewbacca made their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'', and Skywalker made his way to an X-wing in order to defend the ''Harbinger''. C-3PO, on the other hand, was accidentally left behind, allowing himself to be captured by Task Force 99.<ref name=\"SW 25\">[[Star Wars (2015) 25|''Star Wars'' (2015) 25]]</ref>\n\nAs the invading members of the task force made their way through the bridge, Solo detonated a thermal detonator on the bridge, allowing him and Organa to escape. The duo grabbed [[breath mask]]s to give them oxygen in the vacuum of space. The two began to argue about their survival when the ''Millennium Falcon'' arrived to pick them up. Meanwhile, R2-D2 made his way to an escape pod and saved himself. The ''Harbinger'' finally was destroyed by the constant barrage of Imperial fire. Red and Blue Squadron, as well as the ''Falcon'', jumped to hyperspace before any more destruction could take place.<ref name=\"SW 25\" />\n\n====Escape from Skorii-Lei====\n{{Quote|Rebellion is an idea bigger than any of us, it has to be to inspire.

The engineer-turned-janitor [[Pash Davane]] took in the wounded princess and considered what to do with her. After returning from her area's [[Skorii-Lei Fish Market|fish market]], Davane was attacked by Leia with her droid [[Bruce]]'s arm. Leia threatened Pavane with a deactivated blaster in order to determine why she was there. The janitor revealed that she stitched up some of Organa's wounds, and in turn Leia revealed that she was transporting information vital to the Alliance. Although the two disagreed on ideological grounds, Pavane agreed to help Organa escape through the planet's oceans.<ref name=\"SWA2\">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 2|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 2]]</ref>\n\nSome time later, the two had put on wetsuits and prepared to leave when stormtrooper's arrived at Pash's house. Pash distracted and knocked out the soldiers and the duo escaped into the city. Hiding in a random house, Leia collapsed from her wounds. There, she and Pash discussed what motivated the former to fight the Empire despite all the loss she endured. Although ready to give Pash the data tape with vital Alliance information, Davane convinced her to continue on into the water. Pursued by security forces underwater, the duo managed to escape and rendezvous with Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca. Leia was able to recover on the ''Millennium Falcon'' and managed to convince Pash to join the rebellion.<ref name=\"SWA2\" />\n\n====The matter of C-3PO's capture====\nAfter C-3PO was captured by SCAR Squadron, Solo, Skywalker, and Leia regrouped with the rebel fleet and decided not to go after him because he was a droid and SCAR Squadron was too dangerous. However, R2-D2 rebelled against this and went on a [[Mission to rescue C-3PO|solo mission]] of his own to rescue his old friend.<ref name=\"SW 26\">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref>\n\n====The Screaming Citadel====\n{{Quote|Hey, don't make it about her and her freakshow.

After Skywalker again encountered the rogue archaeologist Aphra in a cantina, she offered to give him a meeting with a Jedi Master if he went with her to the forest planet of [[Ktath'atn]]. Unbeknownst to Organa and the rest of the alliance, Aphra [[Mission to Ktath'atn|brought]] Skywalker to meet the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen of Ktath'atn]], who planned on feasting on the Jedi-in-training. Because she was unaware of his whereabouts, Organa questioned Skywalker's temporary astromech droid [[S4]]. However, the droid refused to give up the information. Starros, who had received a message from Aphra, used a loophole in the droid's programming to force it to reveal that Skywalker had gone with Aphra in secret. Organa believed that Aphra had kidnapped Skywalker, so Organa, Starros, and Solo hatched a plan to rescue him.<ref name=\"The Screaming Citadel 1\">[[The Screaming Citadel 1|''The Screaming Citadel'' 1]]</ref>\n\nAs the group prepared to depart, Starros informed them of the [[Queen of Ktath'atn]]'s yearly meetings with visitors to exchange organic oddities. After realizing what may become of Skywalker, the trio began the journey to Ktath'atn in the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, upon arriving, they were immediately captured by Aphra's droid associates [[0-0-0]] and [[BT-1]].<ref name=\"SW 31\">[[Star Wars (2015) 31|''Star Wars'' (2015) 31]]</ref>\n\nHowever, the droids spared the rebels, and they reluctantly gave Solo permission to pilot Aphra's ship, the ''[[Ark Angel II]]'', to Aphra and Skywalker's [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|location]]. When they arrived, the archaeologist and the Padawan were fleeing from mutated creatures. Starros attempted to shoot Aphra, but Organa and Skywalker prevented her from doing so. Organa threatened Skywalker with a [[court-martial]] if he disobeyed orders again. She then asked the group which way to go, to which Solo responded, \"Any direction away from [[Queen of Ktath'atn's hive|them]]!\" The rebel group held off the Queen's hive and entered a room filled with what Aphra identified as [[Abersyn symbiote]]s. Aphra found some blueprints for the Citadel, and asked Skywalker to follow her. However, the rogue archaeologist led Skywalker, and the rest of the rebels, into a trap for the Queen and her hive. The Queen took mental control of Skywalker and Solo, while Aphra allowed the rest of the group to escape.<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra 7\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>\n\nOrgana immediately began formulating a plan to rescue them, asking Aphra's droid associates to assist her. 0-0-0 came up with the idea to transport an Abersyn symbiote in the dome of Skywalker's droid S4. Leia reluctantly agreed to his plan. BT-1 used explosive missiles to blow a hole in the room they were in, and the group made their escape. They encountered [[Bombinax]], the Queen's lieutenant, beating Aphra's Wookiee associate [[Black Krrsantan]]. Organa shot at Bombinax in order to distract him and \"save\" Krrsantan. The group made their way inside the citadel and sealed the door. 0-0-0 immediately began performing a surgery on Krrsantan to transplant the symbiote into his body, much to Leia's chagrin. By the time Bombinax broke through the sealed door, the symbiote had made its way into Krrsantan's consciousness and easily dispatched him.<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra 7\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>\n\n0-0-0 managed to convince the feral Wookiee not to kill them, and instead to attack other Citadel personnel. With a new path forged in blood for them, the group made their way to rescue Luke and Han. However, by the time they arrived in the Queen's facility, Solo had been enthralled by the monarch. Reluctant to shoot him, she was temporarily captured by the Queen's guard. Before being infected, Sana was able to disable Han. As all of this was going on, Luke was able to use the Quuen of Ktath'atn's parasites against her.<ref name=\"SW 32\">[[Star Wars (2015) 32|''Star Wars'' (2015) 32]]</ref>\n\nThrough the power of her words, Leia was able to break the spell that Han was under. Still having the power of the Queen's thrall, Solo was able to control the other troops and force them to lower their weapons. Meanwhile, Luke struck down the Queen of Ktath'atn, disabling all under her control. With the control of her hive now ceded to Solo, the smuggler decided to release all who were under her control. Leia ordered 0-0-0 to remove the parasite from Han. The rebels and the rogue archaeologists parted ways afterwards, having freed the people of Ktath'atn.<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra 8\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 8|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 8]]</ref>\n\n====Surviving in the wild====\nDuring a mission with Skywalker, he had to pilot into a nebula to get away from TIEs hunting them. The nebula disabled the ship, forcing them to crash on [[Unidentified ocean planet|an ocean planet]]. There they had to survive in the wild on [[Unidentified desert island|an island]]. Skywalker's experience with machinery such as [[moisture vaporator]]s helped keep them alive. But they had to use the [[dedlanite]] from their blasters for the moisture vaporators and thus couldn't use their blasters for hunting. One night, Organa and Skywalker lay on the ground looking up to the sky full of stars. Alderaan was still visible, as the light from the explosion hadn't reached this part of the galaxy. Later, there was an explosion in the ocean, and up to the beach came a [[Unidentified aquatic species|native species]] of the planet. They followed the creatures back into the water and saw that the Empire were destroying their underwater [[Unidentified aquatic species city|worlds]] in search of Organa and Skywalker. So, they lit a great fire on the beach to attract the Empire's attention. Up from the waters came an AT-AT and [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretroopers]]. Organa and Skywalker managed to fight them off and take over their AT-AT. After disabling the AT-AT, they repaired the shuttle and returned to the Rebel Fleet.<ref name=\"SW33\" />\n\n====Potential Odona Base====\n{{Quote|You don't ''owe'' me anything, Han. In the Alliance, we don't keep a tally of debts! And we don't blame others when our choices turn out poorly. We make the best of it--together.|Leia Organa to Han Solo|Star Wars Annual (2015) 3}}\nSome time later, Han Solo led Leia to the remote world of [[Odona]] in an attempt to find a new location for a rebel base. However, as their mission went on, the duo found themselves lost in the caves of the hostile planet, chased by a [[Unidentified creature (Odona)|six-legged creature]]. Solo saved the duo by shooting the ceiling of the cave, separating them from the creature. Organa was disappointed by Solo's lack of knowledge of the planet he purported to know so much about. As the duo bickered in their usual way, a trio of bounty hunters began shooting at them, wanting to collect Solo's bounty. The duo were separated, with an injured Han ending up back in the caves while Leia returned to the ''Millennium Falcon''. The hunters, led by [[Frax]], a [[Nikto]] with a vendetta against Solo, pursued him into the caves.<ref name=\"SWA3\">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 3|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 3]]</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Organa armed herself and searched for Solo in the caves. After rescuing Solo, an angry and wounded Frax killed his two partners for wanting to leave Solo alone. All made their way out to the snowy landscape. Leia decided to seal the other entrance of the cave and in response, Frax shot her, causing her to pass out. Some time afterwards, Chewbacca and Alliance soldiers rescued her and Solo; Frax had frozen to death. As they recovered in a medical frigate, Solo told Organa that he intended to repay the life debt that he owed her for saving his life on the mission, to which she said that he didn't owe her anything.<ref name=\"SWA3\" />\n\n====Return to Horox III====\n{{Quote|This is ''war''.|Leia Organa to Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Sana Starros|Star Wars (2015) 37}}\nOrgana, Skywalker, Solo, Starros, Threepio, and Artoo returned to the rebel outpost on Horox III just to find it all [[Mission to Horox III|burned down]] with no survivors.

There, Organa discussed with [[Ubin Des]], former member of the Rebellion, about assisting the Partisans in stopping the Empire from mining the rest of the kyber crystals from Jedha.<ref name=\"SW38\">[[Star Wars (2015) 38|''Star Wars'' (2015) 38]]</ref>\n\nOrgana, Skywalker, and Solo were brought before the [[Tognath]] named [[Benthic]], once [[Saw Gerrera]]'s second in command and now the leader of the Partisans. They all had to wear bags over their heads so they wouldn't know where the Partisans' base was located. Organa proposed that the Rebellion would help the Partisans defend Jedha by giving them supplies. After much hesitation, Benthic stated that they were in need of the Rebels' support and agreed.<ref name=\"SW39\">[[Star Wars (2015) 39|''Star Wars'' (2015) 39]]</ref>\n\nThey then participated in a mission to blow up the newly deployed mining machine set up by the Empire. After, Benthic and his team had sabotaged it from the inside, Organa and Solo arrived and blew the machine up. When they came back to the base, Skywalker was going to follow the pilgrim [[Chulco Gi]] to a Force temple. Leia, furious over Skywalker leaving at such an important time, called him irresponsible, but he left anyway.<ref name=\"SW40\">[[Star Wars (2015) 40|''Star Wars'' (2015) 40]]</ref>\n\nAfter the Partisans had successfully blown up the Empire's machine, they had enlisted the help of [[Shu-Torun]] [[Monarch of Shu-Torun|Queen]] [[Trios]]. She deployed the [[Leviathan (Continent-class crawler)|Leviathan]], a mining vehicle as big as a city, to the surface of Jedha. The Partisans tried to attack it, but it had no effect. Organa then had Chewbacca bring schematics of the Leviathan from Shu-Torun to the Partisans.<ref name=\"SW41\">[[Star Wars (2015) 41|''Star Wars'' (2015) 41]]</ref>\n\nOrgana organized a briefing, detailing how they would attack the Leviathan. A small team would infiltrate the core security system and power down its anto-air weapons seal off the bridge of the majority of the crawler. Then a larger team would join and they would together control the vehicle into the blast crate from the Death Star. Organa, together with Skywalker, Threepio, and Artoo snuck into the Leviathan as the smaller team. When they found the control nexus, Skywalker left to help the other team fight Imperials since he was no longer needed to shut down the crawler. Organa with the help of Threepio and Artoo shut down the weapons and allowed the ''Millennium Falcon'', with the larger team, to land without getting shot down. Even though she heard there were fights going on close by, she had to say and protect the control nexus. Suddenly, she heard a voice behind her. She turned around and standing there was Queen Trios of Shu-Torun with a blaster pointed at Organa.<ref name=\"SW42\">[[Star Wars (2015) 42|''Star Wars'' (2015) 42]]</ref>\n\nInstead of shooting Organa, she told Organa to punch her. Organa did so and then blasted the surveillance camera, realizing that Trios had helped them. She then asked why Trios had leaked the plans for the crawler to them. Trios then told her how Darth Vader had assassinated her father and given her the throne. Vader gave her a piece of Alderaan to teach her a lesson. And he did, but not in the way he had intended. She decided that would never allow that to happen to Shu-Torun. Though she couldn't oppose them openly, she was sabotaging them in secret. Trios explained how she was willing to sacrifice the Leviathan to raise her above suspicion. Organa asked her if she were offering to be an inside contact for the Rebellion. Trios answered that she would be willing to do even more and offered Organa Shu-Torun's hidden resources. They shook hands, and Organa left with Skywalker who had arrived, to help the remaining Rebels. Trios then stayed behind so that she could open up the passages for the Imperials late enough so that the Rebels could escape but early enough to remove suspicion from her. Skywalker then asked Organa who that was, and she answered, just what she was looking for, a little more hope. They met up with the rest and left the Leviathan on the ''Millennium Falcon'' just as it fell into the blast crate of the Death Star. Trios narrowly escaped in a shuttle as well. The Rebels regrouped on NaJedha and wished good luck to Benthic and his Partisans. Organa, Skywalker, Solo, Threepio, and Artoo then left the planet and flew off with the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"SW43\">[[Star Wars (2015) 43|''Star Wars'' (2015) 43]]</ref>\n\n====Baraan-Fa and Crait====\nDuring the Empire's [[attack on the Rebel fleet]], Organa worked with Mothma to find a viable location for a new base. She and Mothma agreed on [[Baraan-Fa]] and ordered the fleet there. Once there, Organa and Mothma continued to search for a new location for their base. Organa suggested [[Sabanash]]'s wetlands or the [[Moon of Ooloponi]]. She asked Mothma for a squadron to see if [[Crait]] would be suitable for a base. Mothma was skeptical about Crait's status as a dead planet, but Organa told her that [[Trusk Berinato]] assured her and her father that [[Mines of Crait|Crait's mines]] would ideal for the Rebels. Mothma agreed to Organa's request.<ref name=\"Storms of Crait\">[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi \u2013 The Storms of Crait 1|''Star Wars: The Last Jedi \u2013 The Storms of Crait'' 1]]</ref>\n\nOrgana [[Mission to Crait|took]] her team, [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], and the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Crait with equipment. Upon their arrival, Organa met with Berinato and was given a tour of the mines. Following the tour, Organa had a drink with Berinato and told him that it was premature to believe the Rebels would use the mines as a base. She knew Berinato had dealings with the Empire and had stormtroopers on standby. She tried to convince Berinato to do the right thing, but he refused. Organa, Solo, and Red Squadron used [[V-4X-D ski speeder]]s against SCAR squadron. After dealing with SCAR squadron, Organ was confronted by Berinato, who attempted to capture Organa, but she was able to shoot his blaster out of his hand. She and the others left Crait<ref name=\"Storms of Crait\" /> and some of their equipment.<ref name=\"Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition\">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref> Organa informed Mothma of this.<ref name=\"Storms of Crait\" />\n\n====Mutiny on Mon Cala====\nOrgana, her team and Admiral Ackbar to Mon Cala to meet with [[Grand Admiral]] [[Dors Urtya]], Mon Cala's regent and commander of its [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet|Mercantile Fleet]]. They landed on an island in a nature preservation zone, but their meeting was interrupted by stormtrooper patrol and an [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|Imperial gunship]]. Despite that, Organa and the others were able to lose the stormtroopers and rendezvous at a boat. Organa asked Urtya to give the Alliance their fleet to defeat the Empire. However, Urtya refused to let the fleet join the Alliance due to the Empire's continuing [[invasion of Mon Cala]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 44\">[[Star Wars (2015) 44|''Star Wars'' (2015) 44]]</ref>\n\nOrgana, her team and Ackbar left Mon Cala on the ''Millennium Falcon'' and went to the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]].

However, Organa suggested rescuing King Lee-Char.

When they entered his cell to free him, Organa was stunned to see him impersonating her father.<ref name=\"Star Wars 45\" /> Knowing it was Arpagion, Organa punched the Clawdite in the face for his trick. They stunned Arpagion and brought him aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', where Organa convinced Arpagion to aid them in their mission by impersonating Moff [[Tan Hubi]], whose bio-signature would allow them access to the prison to free the captive King. Then, Organa explained her plan, which was to attend an opera on Mon Cala where Hubi would be attending, where they would kidnap Hubi and have Arpagion double the moff at the party while they took the real moff to free Lee-Char.<ref name=\"Star Wars 46\">[[Star Wars (2015) 46|''Star Wars'' (2015) 46]]</ref>\n\nOrgana sent R2 and C-3PO in as server droids to give Hubi a drug in his favorite drink, a [[grabd accelerator]].

Lee-Char was eager to help but admitted he could not move because of all of the machines he was hooked up to. Skywalker hunted down a camera droid where Lee-Char's message to his people will be recorded. However, Hubi clicked a button on the wall that alerted Imperial forces that the Moff Hubi on Mon Cala was an impostor. Stormtroopers stormed into the cell, killing Lee-Char as he finished his message and also accidentally killing Moff Hubi. Organa led the crew back to their ship, barely escaping the planet.<ref name=\"SW48\">[[Star Wars (2015) 48|''Star Wars'' (2015) 48]]</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Arpagion was exposed as an impostor, but was saved by the recently arrived rebels.

Organa and the rest of High Command decided to throw a party for the troops before their forces dispersed. After a speech from Mothma prepared Ackbar's [[Alpha Group]], General Dodanna's [[Beta Group]], General [[Hera Syndulla]]'s [[Gamma Group]], and General [[Vanden Willard]]'s [[Delta Group]] to depart, they discovered that their hypderdrives had all been sabotaged and that Trios had gone missing. Organa helplessly watched as the cruisers saw their hangar doors, comm systems, [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]], hyperspace systems, and propulsion engines be shut down and the Empire's [[Death Squadron]] led by Darth Vader and his command ship, the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'' arrive in the system.<ref name=\"SW 50\">[[Star Wars (2015) 50|''Star Wars'' (2015) 50]]</ref>\n\nVader quickly destroyed Willard's flagship ''[[Yavin's Hope]]''. Trios fled back to her ship and ordered her men to launch, but a rebel strike team led by Organa and Colonel [[Bandwin Cor]] boarded her ship, killing her men. Trios managed to get to an escape pod and told Organa to forgive her, saying she would do anything to ensure that Shu-Torun would not become the next Alderaan before escaping.<ref name=\"Star Wars 51\">[[Star Wars (2015) 51|''Star Wars'' (2015) 51]]</ref>\n\nOrgana watched as ships commanded by [[Lajaie]] and [[Bob Hudsol]] were destroyed. Eventually, the rebels found an override to the closed bay doors and Organa again looked on as Skywalker led the newly minted [[Rogue Squadron]] to combat the enemy. Then, a rebel technician broke into Trios' files and discovered an override code that would make all their systems operational again. However, the codes were only on the ''Executor''. Organa devised a plan, in which she and Draven would led a squad of [[Rebel Alliance Special Forces|Special Forces]] commandos to the ''Executor'', in Trios' shuttle for disguise, to steal the codes and return to the ship.<ref name=\"Star Wars 53\">[[Star Wars (2015) 53|''Star Wars'' (2015) 53]]</ref>\n\nAs the group gets clearance to land on the ''Executor'', Vader returned to the ship to meet with Trios. In the hangar, the rebels killed the Imperial officer who greeted them, but are soon faced by Vader. The rebels fled and attempted to access a computer inside, where they obtained the codes while the rearguard was caught by Vader. Organa led their remaining forces to the hangar to find a ship to escape, but they found only a lone TIE fighter. Draven then told Organa that he and the special forces would stay behind to let her escape with the codes. She flew back in the stolen TIE, but Skywalker got on her tail and tried to shoot her down. Unable to communicate with them because she did not have a TIE pilot helmet, Organa demonstrated her loyalties by shooting down another TIE. Skywalker deduced it was a friendly and ordered Rogue Squadron to form up on him and protect the TIE. They landed<ref name=\"SW 54\">[[Star Wars (2015) 54|''Star Wars'' (2015) 54]]</ref> on the [[MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser]] [[Republic (MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser)|''Republic'']].<ref name=\"SW 55\">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref> Organa alerted the commander of the ship, General Dodonna of the codes she obtained, and their ship escaped the system.<ref name=\"SW 54\" />\n\nOrgana and Skywalker were both shocked to hear Dodonna tell them that they could not risk their ship to go back and attempt to rescue their remaining forces. They eventually convinced him to go help, with the ''Republic'' serving as a distraction to allow Organa to lead a group of shuttles to rescue forces off of the Space Docks.<ref name=\"SW 55\" />\n\n====Saponza's Gang====\nOrgana was responsible for recruiting [[Tatooine rebel cell|Saponza's Gang]] to the Alliance. Working with her, Solo, Mothma, [[Jennica Pierce]], and the criminal underworld, the gang successfully rescued former Senator [[Johhar Kessen]] from Imperial custody. They also disrupted [[Kosh]]'s contraband smuggling operation, and [[Battle for Tatooine|liberated]] Tatooine from Imperial control.

Upon arrival, Leia found her friend and fellow rebel Luke Skywalker. Although Skywalker was supposed to be checking out other worlds, he said the Force took him to Bogano. Leia and Luke then found a small animal and decided to follow it. The pair ended up arriving at the [[Bogano Vault]], where Leia and Luke expressed their opinions about the planet. Leia turned out to be wrong about building a rebel base there, as the little animal led them to some stormtroopers who were dealing with several animals of the same species, showing that the Empire knew of the planet's existence.<ref>\"[[The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part I]]\"-[[Star Wars Adventures (2020) 7|''Star Wars Adventures'' (2020) 7]]</ref> Along with Luke, Leia defeated the stormtroopers, who intended to sell the animals on the black market, and then left the planet to continue her quest of find a location for a rebel base.<ref>\"[[The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 2]]\"-[[Star Wars Adventures (2020) 8|''Star Wars Adventures'' (2020) 8]]</ref>\n\n===End of the Emperor's reign===\n====A new base====\n{{Quote|Listen, I know we've all been spread pretty thin, but we've made it through.

Though several of the pilots wrote their names, [[Rogue Four]] [[Derek Klivian]] objected to the pool, feeling it was a morbid game over their commander's life. Before Senesca could respond, Organa revealed she was standing at the doorway by stating the pool was not morbid. She walked in and explained that, by betting in the pool, the pilots were certain Skywalker was alive. Taking the marker from Senesca, she bet on every pilot, explaining it was what she and the other Rebel leaders did every day.

Organa helped in repairing the ship, when Solo appeared, drawing closer to her before both ended up in a passionate kiss that lasted until C-3PO's arrival.

The plan worked; as the Imperial fleet prepared to exit the [[Anoat system]], Solo detached the ship from the hull. With a faulty hyperdrive, the group decided to go to the [[Bespin system]], where an old acquaintance of Solo, [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], owned a [[mining]] colony.

However, unbeknownst to them, Calrissian had made a deal with Vader to hand over the rebels in exchange for non-interference from the Empire. Captured by Vader, where the Dark Lord waited for Skywalker's arrival, Leia and the others were taken to a [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freeze chamber|facility]], where Solo was to be frozen in [[carbonite]] to test if the chambers were suitable for trapping Skywalker.

The princess, who was [[Escape from Cloud City|escaping]] aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Calrissian, sensed Skywalker's presence through the Force, and they turned around to retrieve Skywalker at her insistence. Once they rescued Skywalker, the ship was chased by TIE/ln starfighters into orbit and confronted by the ''Executor''. Thanks to the astromech droid, the hyperdrive worked, and the ''Falcon'' escaped the Imperial threat.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Aboard the ''Falcon'', Organa was still angry at Calrissian for making his deal with the Empire and introduced him to Skywalker. She then comforted her friend, who chose not to tell her that Vader was his father, instead revealing to her that Obi-Wan Kenobi had not responded when he reached out. Organa was certain the Jedi Master would answer and that, if he did not, Skywalker was strong enough to find his own path. Knowing they could not save Solo at the moment but that they could help the rebellion, Organa ignored Calrissian's concerns about the Empire and chose to return to the Rebel fleet, commandeering the ''Falcon'' for the Alliance. She also reminded Calrissian that he had betrayed them to the Imperials, which was something she felt they would not move past for sometime, though the Cloud City administrator felt he deserved credit for getting the team off Bespin.<ref name=\"SW 1 2020\">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref>\n\nThey arrived in the Mid Rim to meet with the [[Fourth Division]] at [[Rendezvous Point Delta-Three]].

Organa, the ''Falcon'', the 4th division were able to escape. Though her other forces [[Battle near Malastare|had destroyed]] the [[Eighth Division]], Zahra was forced to report her failure to Vader, who was aware of her hatred for Organa. Seeking to keep Skywalker alive, Vader allowed her to kill the Rebel princess if she could, but informed her that the ''Falcon'' was off limits. Having escaped to [[Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine]], Organa then went to meet with Commander [[Grek (commander)|Grek]] aboard his ship. They discussed how the Empire found them and the Eighth Division at Malastare, and Organa realized that the Empire had broken their codes. Thus, the rebels knew if any cell contacted another, both groups could be found and destroyed.

After swearing to secrecy, Organa was escorted by Skywalker to her quarters, where she devised a strategy to present at the meeting the day after&mdash;[[Operation Yellow Moon]]&mdash;to divert the Imperial attention to her, instead of the upcoming mission to Endor.

They were taken aboard the star destroyer and taken to interrogation rooms. Khione went into Leia's cell and brought Lokmarcha inside. The commando had hidden a ion bomb inside of his clothing and sacrificed himself. Leia took the captains uniform and Antrot, Nein, and Kidi pretended to be her prisoners. When stormtroopers realized the ploy, Antrot ran as a distraction and was shot as Nein launched off in the shuttle ''[[Tydirium]]''. All the ships they had warned, returned and [[Destruction of the Shieldmaden|destroyed]] the Shieldmaiden.<ref name=\"Moving Target\" />\n\nWith Aleri's help, Organa then contacted Skywalker, who informed her that most of the fleet was nearly assembled, and that Solo was still frozen in carbonite in Jabba's palace. They arranged a rendezvous on [[Kothlis]], where he would inform her of his plan to rescue Solo.<ref name=\"Moving Target\" /> Although Mothma tried to talk Organa out of the dangerous plan,<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" /> they nevertheless carried on with it.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n====Visit to Ord Mantell====\nIn order to carry out the rescue of Han Solo, Leia required an adequate disguise in order to fool Jabba the Hutt. Because of this, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droid R2-D2 traveled to Ord Mantell in order to meet [[Maz Kanata]], who was the one to provide her with the disguise. Leia proceeded to ask Kanata how she would provide them with a cover story for Jabba, with Maz cautioning patience. At that moment, the bounty hunter [[Boushh]] fired shots at the group. While hiding behind crates, Kanata explained to Leia that the bounty hunter would be the source of her disguise. Chewbacca and Organa engaged the bounty hunter while R2-D2 operated a crane. Leia managed to shoot the blaster out of Boushh's hand, leading to the bounty hunter charging the princess with a lance. After fighting Boushh for a bit, Leia ducked out of the fight in order to let R2-D2 disable the bounty hunter with a crane. Afterwards, Organa used Boushh's armor as her disguise.

Rebel Alliance command received word from [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] that his ship had been shot down by bounty hunters on [[Arkanis]], and he was on the run. Leia contacted Lando to tell him they were coming for him. In a clearing, Lando ran into Leia in Boushh's outfit, believing her to be the bounty hunter. He tried to fight but Leia knocked him down before revealing herself. She led him back toward the ''Falcon'', finally giving him an earful about Han's predicament. Everything at Cloud City was a \"beautiful double cross\" that had relied on Han surviving in his usual ways, Lando explained, but he hadn't anticipated the carbonite freezing. Leia chastised him for relying on schemes, and Lando countered that scoundrels try to make things work as best as they can. They heard Chewbacca captured by bounty hunters in the distance, who dragged him to a cantina to meet with their boss, [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]]. Lando suggested she call in the Rebels to help, but she worried the Empire had too much of a presence in the area and that such an attack might have alerted Jabba and ruined any rescue plans.\n\nLeia entered the cantina, disguised as Boushh to congratulate Bossk and question him about Calrissian. The Trandoshan said he could get to the smuggler later as Jabba's price on the Wookiee was substantial. \"Boushh\" left saying he would see Bossk on Tatooine. Suspicious, Bossk sent his crew after their associate, and they found \"him\" at a campfire with Calrissian tied up. The trap sprung, they fired on a decoy as Leia stunned them from behind with a [[Bolos|bolo]]-gun. But Bossk jumped down from his ship above. The two exchanged gunfire while Lando begged to be set free to fight. Leia hit some rocks that knocked Bossk down and jammed his blaster. As she tried to negotiate a swap for Chewbacca, Bossk's crew came to and fired at her. She shot both, wounding instead of killing them.

This angered Jabba, who knocked C-3PO to the ground.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Leia had anticipated this, however. Remembering what Solo had told her about an incident in which he and his then lover [[Qi'ra]] escaped from the [[Den of the White Worms|Den]] of the [[White Worms]] on Corellia in [[13 BBY]], she had brought a [[thermal detonator]] with her.<ref name=\"Explanation Behind The Thermal Detonator\">{{Twitter|JonKasdan|status/1040529501870944256|[[Jon Kasdan]]|quote=In honor of the digital release of #SoloAStarWarsStory & in lieu of a commentary, here are 53 random factoids & notes about the making & writing for anybody who's interested.

Jabba laughed and offered 35,000 for the Wookiee, an offer Organa accepted, and Chewie was taken by two [[Gamorrean]]s to be imprisoned. Later that night, Organa released Solo from his carbonite coffin, only to be caught by the Hutt and his minions,<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> prompting her to use her [[armor]] to signal Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been caught.<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" /> Ignoring Solo's pleas, Jabba had him thrown in prison with Chewbacca, and forced Organa to become his slave; wearing a [[dancing-girl costume]], Organa was collared and chained to Jabba's throne to stay with him at all times.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nA couple of days later, Organa watched as Skywalker tried to bargain with the [[crime lord]] for his friends' liberation and was thrown into a pit with a [[rancor]]. Surviving his ordeal, Jabba ordered for Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca to be taken to the [[Dune Sea]] where they would executed in [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] and eaten alive by the [[sarlacc]] over the course of a thousand years. On the ''[[Khetanna]]'', Organa was allowed to leave the Hutt's side momentarily to see as her friends were executed, and she patiently waited until Skywalker started retaliating with his [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|new lightsaber]]. She destroyed the barge's controls to throw the vessel into darkness and jumped over Jabba's tail.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Jabbachoke.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Organa strangles Jabba the Hutt to death.]]\nGrabbing the slack of the very chain with which Jabba had enslaved her, Organa threw its length around the crime lord's huge neck, braced her legs against his back, and leaned back hard while pulling the chain, slowly but forcefully strangling him to death. R2-D2 then broke her chain, and they headed for the top surface of the [[sail barge]], where the astromech droid and C-3PO jumped off the vehicle's edge and Organa met with Skywalker. Pointing the guns toward the heart of the vehicle, the two began the barge's destruction together and swung to the [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|skiff]] where Calrissian, Chewbacca, and Solo awaited them. Picking up the two droids, they drove the [[skiff]] off just as the ''Khetanna'' exploded.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n====Battle of Endor====\n{{Quote|Luke, don't talk that way.

Making their way through the [[Tree|forest]], they came across Imperial [[scout trooper]]s, whom Organa and Skywalker pursued on a stolen speeder bike. Though they took care of the troopers, the two were separated as she was thrown off her speeder and knocked unconscious. An [[Ewok]], [[Wicket Wystri Warrick|Wicket]], woke her up, and Organa quickly befriended him. Though they were discovered by other two scouts, Organa and Wicket managed to get rid of them.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> While on their way to Wicket's home, [[Bright Tree Village]], they came across two other Ewoks who had been stopped by two stormtroopers. Wicket climbed a nearby tree and, with help from Organa, trapped the stormtroopers in a vine. When Organa, Wicket, and the two other Ewoks arrived at Bright Tree Village, they presented her with a dress as a gift for helping them escape the stormtroopers.<ref name=\"Ewok Escape\">{{FOD|Ewok Escape}}</ref>\n\nAfter a few hours, she realized that her friends were to become a banquet in C-3PO's honor, whom the Ewoks thought to be their [[Deity|god]]. She tried to intervene, but they threatened her with [[spear]]s. They were only freed after Skywalker used the Force to levitate the [[protocol droid]] as a proof of his deific \"[[Magick|magic]]\" to the tribe. Later that night, Organa listened as C-3PO told the Ewoks their story, prompting [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]] to proclaim them a part of the tribe.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_Leia_BTV_RotJ.png|thumb|left|180px|Organa about to learn the truth of her parentage]]\nIt was then that Skywalker decided the time had come for him to leave his friends and face Vader, and Organa followed him out of the tribal gathering and asked him what was troubling him. Skywalker then revealed that not only was Vader his father but hers as well, and that he was her brother, something she had somehow always known; he then left the village to face the Sith Lord in combat alone. Solo then appeared to question Organa, and became jealous of Skywalker, but soon apologized and comforted her.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nThe next day, Organa fought alongside the rest of the team in the [[Battle of Endor|battle]] that followed their initial infiltration at the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] and subsequent capture by Imperial reinforcements. While the Ewoks provided a distraction long enough for them to take hold of their position at the doors, she was injured with a blaster wound and Solo confessed his love when she protected him from two stormtroopers. With Chewbacca's stolen [[All Terrain Scout Transport]], they tricked the [[Imperial officer|officers]] into letting them enter and destroy the shield generator, which in turn allowed Calrissian and Nunb, along with Antilles, to fly into the Death Star's core and destroy it from the inside.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Han_solo_6.jpg|thumb|234x234px|right|Organa with Han Solo after the Battle of Endor]]\nIn the aftermath, Solo reassured Organa that Skywalker had surely survived, but she already knew it, as she felt her brother's presence through the Force. Solo told her he would not interfere in their relationship, but she informed Solo that Skywalker was her brother, and they shared a kiss. Afterwards, they arranged for the Alliance to join them at Bright Tree Village, where they celebrated their victory, and where Skywalker ultimately reunited with them.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Soon after this, during the celebrations on Endor, Organa tried to discourage their Ewok allies from eating captured stormtroopers, and so she sent for Solo and Chewbacca to meet with General [[Hera Syndulla]] to gather food rations from her. Syndulla agreed but Solo had to admit that the ''Ghost'' was a better ship than the ''Millennium Falcon'', and Solo reluctantly agreed. When Solo and Chewbacca returned with the food portions, Organa eased Solo by stating that the ''Millennium Falcon'' was the better ship, and distributed the food portions to the Ewoks.<ref name=\"An Imperial Feast\">{{FOD|An Imperial Feast}}</ref>\n\nLater, Leia and Han had a [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa|small wedding ceremony]] that was attended by those they trusted. They did not keep the ceremony a secret but did not make it publicly known.<ref name=\"Life Debt\">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>\n\n====Gorax attack====\nAfter the battle, Leia told Skywalker that the battle would have gone very differently if it weren't for the Ewoks. Two troubled Ewoks, Wicket and [[Kneesaa]], approached them and told them they needed help resetting the traps used in the Battle of Endor. After agreeing to help, they encountered a giant [[Gorax]] and fled from it.<ref name=\"Traps and Tribulations\">{{FOD|Traps and Tribulations}}</ref>\n\nIt cornered them at the edge of the forest, overlooking a swamp. There was a log trap (an improvised battering ram held by ropes) nearby, however, and Wicket and Kneesaa had already reached it. As Skywalker distracted the Gorax, Leia helped the Ewoks. While Skywalker used his Force powers to distract the giant, Leia struggled to cut through the ropes holding up the battering ram. Skywalker lent Leia his lightsaber to cut the ropes, and the Gorax was pushed into the swamp by the log trap.<ref name=\"Traps and Tribulations\" />\n\n===Jedi training===\n{{Quote|I treasured each moment I spent with my brother.

At Skywalker's suggestion the two of them trained on Ajan Kloss.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> She went on to construct her [[Leia's lightsaber|own]] lightsaber that produced a blue-colored blade, and she would train in lightsaber combat becoming skilled enough to fight on par with Skywalker and even best him in a sparring match on occasion.<ref name=\"TROS\" /> She also practiced meditation with Skywalker,<ref name=\"TROS EE\">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> and learned enough about the basics of the Force to levitate herself and sense other sentient beings.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Luke offered her guidance about how the Force worked and helped her understand, from his personal experience, that the Force offered visions of the future, past, and even of the departed.

But the catalyst of her choice to end her training was on the last night she was with Skywalker. While sparring together, Organa had a vision and sensed the death of her [[Ben Solo|unborn son]] if she were to complete her Jedi path. While Skywalker hoped that his sister would resume her training later on, Organa gave him her lightsaber to convince him otherwise, asking to pass it on to a promising student someday. However, Skywalker hadn't yet done this and Organa didn't know where he had stored her lightsaber.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nWhile she ended her training, Organa treasured every moment she spent with Skywalker.

Her first return to Naboo in years, they were greeted by Governor [[Donta Gesset]] on behalf of [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Sosha Soruna]]. Led into the [[Theed Royal Palace]], the Queen eagerly accepted Organa's invitation. It was then that a planet-wide blackout, with all orbital [[sensor]]s jammed, was caused by Imperial [[climate disruption array]]s, as part of [[Operation: Cinder]], spearheaded by [[Lerr Duvat]].<ref name=\"SE2\">[[Shattered Empire 2|''Shattered Empire'' 2]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle_over_Naboo.png|thumb|left|230px|Organa saving Shara Bey above Naboo]]\nAlerted by Captain [[Korro]], Bey and Organa correctly surmised that it was the work of the Imperial remnant, and asked for pilots and ships. The demilitarization of Naboo years before, however, forced them to use [[N-1 starfighter]]s left in the palace that dated back to the [[Invasion of Naboo]] thirty-six years before, and to manually pilot the ships without the assistance of astromech droids. Momentarily sensing a [[Maul|dark presence]], this being Darth Maul, Organa volunteered for the mission, while the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces|Security Forces]] evacuated the city. Alongside Soruna and Bey, she set out to destroy the Imperial [[satellite]]s, with Bey acting as a distraction for the incoming TIE/ln fighters.<ref name=\"SE3\">[[Shattered Empire 3|''Shattered Empire'' 3]]</ref> During the [[Battle of Theed|battle]], she saved Bey.\n\nThey were, in turn, saved from a new wave of TIE fighters by Calrissian and Nunb on the ''[[Mellcrawler II]]'' and by other ships of the Rebel Fleet, which had been alerted of Operation: Cinder after an [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|assault]] on a ISB black site. Just as Soruna destroyed the last of the satellites, the fleet destroyed Duvat's [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Torment]]'', saving Naboo and letting Organa and Bey reunite with Solo and [[Kes Dameron]], respectively.<ref name=\"SE3\" />\n\nHowever, the surviving Imperials were still intent on carrying out Operation: Cinder and the rebels were forced to protect the city of Theed from them. Leia devised a plan to vanquish the Imperials by triggering an [[ion pulse]], a security system installed years prior and which would deactivate all weapons and vehicles outside the Theed Royal Palace. However, the power relays necessary to activate it had been damaged and needed repairing. Joined by Danger Leader [[Shriv Suurgav]] and recent Imperial defectors [[Iden Versio]] and [[Del Meeko]], Leia took Del and together the two teams managed to restore power. Leia then took up a position on the front lines and ordered all rebel forces to fall back to the palace as the pulse was detonated, rendering all Imperial tech useless and saving the day. After the battle, Leia revealed that she knew both Iden and Del were members of Inferno Squad, a unit which had caused more than a bit of trouble for the rebellion in the past. However, she surmised that fighting the Empire meant something to both of them and formally welcomed them into the New Republic after they expressed a desire to fight for the right side.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>\n\nA few months later, shortly before a [[Emergency summit on Akiva|Imperial emergency summit]] on [[Akiva]], Organa recorded a [[propaganda]] holovid to announce the destruction of the second Death Star, the death of Emperor Palpatine, and the birth of the New Republic to the whole galaxy, encouraging people to contribute to the defeat of the Empire.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n====Balancing family and service====\nFollowing the [[rebellion on Akiva]], Leia served as the senator<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> for the [[Alderaan sector]]<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref> in the reconstituted [[New Republic Senate|Galactic Senate]] in [[Chandrila]]'s [[Hanna City]]. As Senator, she arranged for the wrecked pieces of the second Death Star to be diverted to the [[Alderaan Flotilla]], which used them to build a space station that became their new home. Knowing that her husband and his co-pilot Chewbacca had undertaken a campaign to [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberate]] to Kashyyyk, Leia tried unsuccessfully to marshal support in the Galactic Senate for troops and ships to free the planet. However, the New Republic was too preoccupied with fighting the Empire and holding on to liberated worlds.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWhile her husband Solo had received information from the smuggler [[Imra]] that the Empire had reduced their military presence on Kashyyyk, Leia warned that Imra could not be trusted. Leia's warning proved correct when Han and Chewbacca stumbled onto a trap on Kashyyyk. While Han managed to escape, Chewbacca was captured and locked inside the automated prison of [[Ashmead's Lock]]. Han later contacted Leia while traveling on the edge of [[Wild Space]]. Their conversation was interrupted when Han came under attack from Imperial forces.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nDespite the family crisis with Han, Leia accompanied Chancellor Mon Mothma on a secret meeting with the Imperial [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] on the ocean planet of [[Velusia]]. When a dejected Amedda offered to surrender, Chancellor Mothma and Princess Leia rejected his offer and ordered him to find a way to secure the Galactic Empire's surrender. After returning to Chandrila, Leia requested an audience with the New Republic starfighter pilot [[Norra Wexley]]. When the [[New Republic Defense Force]] refused to help her find Solo, Norra resigned from the [[New Republic Defense Fleet|Navy]] and embarked on a mission to find Han with her son [[Temmin Wexley]], his [[B1-series battle droid]] [[Mister Bones]], the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], [[Zabrak]] bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]], and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nPrincess Leia later attended a high-level New Republic meeting with Admiral Ackbar, Mon Mothma, and the advisers [[Hostis Ij]] and [[Auxi Kray Korbin]] to discuss the war effort. Though Leia was frustrated with the endless bickering within the New Republic leadership, she regarded it as a lesser evil to the dictatorial rule of the late Darth Sidious. While meditating with a potted plant from Endor, Leia receives a revelation that [[Ben Solo|her unborn child]] would be a boy, a fighter, and an angel.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nFollowing the successful New Republic capture of the planet [[Kuat]] and the vital [[Kuat Drive Yards]], Princess Leia contacted Admiral Ackbar by hologram to congratulate his victory. They were then joined by Chancellor Mothma, who informed them that she had been contacted by [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], the leader of the Galactic Empire. With the Empire facing defeat, Grand Admiral Sloane agreed to participate in [[Imperial-Republic peace talks|bilateral peace talks]] on Chandrila. While Leia was skeptical that Sloane was the mysterious [[Gallius Rax|Operator]], she reluctantly joined her comrades in accepting Sloane's offer.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n====Liberation of Kashyyyk====\nLater, Leia and Chancellor Mon Mothma received the liberated rebel prisoners from Ashmead's Lock, who had been freed by Norra and her team. While at Hanna City Spaceport, Leia asked Norra about her husband. Norra reassured the Princess that Solo and Chewbacca were safe but that they had stayed behind on Kashyyyk to free the Wookiees. Unknown to Leia and Mothma, the prisoners were part of [[Fleet Admiral]] Gallius Rax's plot to assassinate the New Republic military and political leadership on Chandrila. Rax, who was the Operator, had secretly fitted the prisoners with inorganic bio-chips that would allow him to remotely control their actions.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nA month later, the Galactic Senate accepted Rae Sloane's offer for bilateral peace talks between the Republic and the Empire. Chancellor Mothma timed the peace talks to take place after [[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]], a public holiday held to celebrate the rescue of the Ashmead's Lock prisoners. Sympathetic to the plight of the enslaved Wookiees, Leia tried to lobby the Chancellor into sending military forces to liberate Kashyyyk. However, Mon Mothma refused to launch an official incursion to avoid jeopardizing the upcoming peace talks. When Mothma offered to negotiate the liberation of Kashyyyk with Sloane, Leia insisted that the freedom and dignity of the Wookiees was non-negotiable.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nPrior to the Liberation Day celebrations, Leia received news from the New Republic [[slicer]] [[Conder Kyl]] that a New Republic probe droid in the [[Kashyyyk system]] had intercepted of the Imperial Grand Moff of Kashyyyk [[Lozen Tolruck]] ordering the Star Destroyers orbiting Kashyyyk to bombard the planet after the Wookiees had revolted en masse. Wanting to rescue her husband and Chewie, Leia convinced Evaan Verlaine to fly as her co-pilot aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Kashyyyk. This timely decision saved her from being assassinated by Rax's unwilling agents.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nLeia later contacted Captain Wedge Antilles via hologram to request the help of [[Phantom Squadron|his squadron]] on Kashyyyk. Upon arriving in Kashyyyk, Leia's ship the ''Millennium Falcon'' and Phantom Squadron flew rings around the Imperial Star Destroyers ''[[Dominion]]'', ''[[Vitiator]]'', and ''[[Neutralizer]]''. Their starships were soon reinforced by Admiral Ackbar's flagship ''[[Home One]]''. Solo and his team managed to hijack the ''Dominion'' and use it to destroy the ''Vitiator''. As a result, the ''Neutralizer'' surrendered to the New Republic, ending Imperial rule on Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nLeia had an emotional reunion with her husband aboard the ''Dominion''{{'s}} hangar bay. After exchanging jokes about rescuing each other, the couple reaffirmed their love for each other. When Solo asked about naming their baby, Leia insisted that their child was not a bandit and called him an angel. The couple then kissed. Later on Kashyyyk, Leia and Han bid farewell to their friend Chewbacca, who stayed behind on his homeworld to reunite with [[Chewbacca's family|his family]]. After learning of the recent [[attack on Chandrila]], the couple returned to the capital with Wedge in tow.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nLater, Princess Leia gave Norra and [[Norra Wexley's team|her team]] her personal and financial backing during their hunt for Grand Admiral Sloane, who they believed was responsible for the attack on Chandrila. Due to her actions at Kashyyyk, Leia had become a political pariah with the New Republic establishment. While the New Republic was no longer offering bounties for Imperial fugitives, she still vowed to do everything that was necessary to help her newfound friends.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n===Tidings from Jakku===\nSeveral months later, Leia was heavily pregnant. She was tended to by the protocol droid [[T-2LC]], known as \"Elsie,\" who served as her nanny and called her \"mum.\" At the advice of Doctor [[Harter Kalonia]], Han bought his wife [[jogan fruit]]s. While talking with her husband about political developments in the wider galaxy, the two received news via hologram from Norra Wexley that the Imperial fugitive Grand Admiral Sloane had fled to the barren [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] world of [[Jakku]]. Leia encouraged Norra to continue her investigation but to be careful.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nNorra and her team traveled to Jakku, where they discovered that most of the Galactic Empire had relocated there. While Norra, Jas Emari, and Mister Bones infiltrated Jakku, Sinjir and Temmin returned to Chandrila with news about the Imperial presence. After receiving Sinjir and Temmin, Leia contacted Chancellor Mothma and told her to come to her domicile. After Mothma had questioned Temmin and Sinjir, Leia defended their mission. Chancellor Mothma responded that the New Republic was responsible for hunting Sloane, not Princess Leia and her friends. However, Mothma praised Leia for her efforts to liberate Jakku.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nLeia opined that the New Republic had the chance to end the war now that the Empire was gathered on Jakku. Chancellor Mothma agreed to raise the matter with the Galactic Senate but decided to send a fact-finding mission first. Unknown to Leia, Mothma's political rival, Senator Tolwar Wartol, had installed a listening device inside T-2LC. Seeking to discredit Chancellor Mothma, Wartol leaked information about the Imperial presence on Jakku to the media. Later, Leia and Han allowed Temmin and Sinjir to borrow the ''Millennium Falcon'' and travel to Jakku. However, Wartol sent guards to stop them from leaving in an effort to sow discord among Mothma's allies.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n===War's end===\nWhile watching the morning news with her husband, Leia and Han saw Senator Wartol informing the media about the Imperial presence on Jakku. After meeting with Sinjir and reassuring him that they had not double-crossed him and Temmin, Leia shared Sinjir's assessment that there was a listening device inside her domicile. Sinjir enlisted the services of his lover Conder, who was a slicer who had previously helped Leia. Conder found a listening device inside T-2LC, and Solo removed it. Leia and Solo promptly informed Chancellor Mothma, who went to confront Senator Wartol.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nLeia and her unborn child stayed behind on Chandrila while Han, Sinjir, Temmin, Conder, and Jom Barell undertook an [[Mission to Nakadia|undercover mission]] on [[Nakadia]], the new capital of the New Republic. The five investigated five senators who had opposed Chancellor Mothma's resolution to send New Republic forces to Jakku. They subsequently uncovered a conspiracy by the [[Black Sun]] and [[Red Key Raiders|Red Key]] crime syndicates to prolong the Galactic Civil War by bribing and coercing the senators. Han and his team foiled the conspiracy by rescuing Senator [[Nim Tar]]'s [[Nim Tar's child|child]]. Sinjir then posed as an adviser to the Chancellor and offered them pardons and political favors if they changed their votes. This ploy worked and the New Republic dispatched military forces to Jakku, beginning the [[Battle of Jakku|final battle]] of the Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nWhile awaiting her husband's return, Leia found that she could sense her unborn son through the Force. She likened his presence to a pulsing living band of light. Sometimes that light dimmed, and other times it was thrust through a vein of darkness. Leia also found that her son could sense her emotions. After Solo returned from Nakadia, the couple talked about the Battle of Jakku. When Solo remarked that it felt weird staying back, Leia reassured him that they had their own adventure and were seeing the start of a new era. Leia then felt her baby turn inside her again, troubled by something she could not feel and understand.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nWith the Battle of Jakku turning in the New Republic's favor, Chancellor Mothma received a peace overture from Grand Vizier Mas Amedda. Leia along with Chancellor Mothma and her new advisers attended the surrender ceremony which took place at the [[crystal]] [[cave]] north of Hanna City, under an ancient [[tintolive tree]]. Leia watched as the Chancellor and Grand Vizier signed the [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Galactic Concordance]], which formally ended the Galactic Civil War and facilitated the Empire's surrender. During the signing, Leia entered the third hour of her labor. However, she only told Han after the ceremony. They then rushed off to the birthing chamber at the heart of Hanna City.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n===Motherhood===\n{{Quote|I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him.

The Populists believed that individual member planets should retain their full sovereignty, while the [[Centrists]] favored a stronger galactic government and a larger military. After Mothma, former [[Chancellor (New Republic)|chancellor]], left the office, the tension between the two factions threatened to cripple the Senate.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nDuring this period, Organa attended a [[Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony|dedication ceremony]] of a new statue of her father, Bail Organa, on Hosnian Prime. At this ceremony, Organa addressed the Senate and attempted to inspire the senators to stop bickering and begin to act. However, her efforts proved unsuccessful, further demonstrating that the Senate was no longer effective. Losing faith that the government could function any longer, Organa resolved to resign as senator at the end of her term.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Organa met privately with the Centrist senator Lady [[Carise Sindian]], who informed her that Lord [[Mellowyn]], the [[Supreme governor]] of [[Birren]] had died without leaving any heirs. Since Mellowyn was a distant kinsman of her adoptive father Bail Organa, Leia was his next in line to inherit the position per the rules of the [[Elder Houses]]. While Organa was not interested in matters relating to royalty, Sindian wanted to preserve that tradition. Organa reassured Sindian that she would have her staff look into the matter immediately.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nLater during a session of the Senate, Organa was present when [[Yendor]], a Twi'lek emissary from the planet [[Ryloth]], appeared before the Senate to ask for help in investigating a [[Nikto]] [[Rinnrivin Di's cartel|cartel]] that was threatening his home planet. The cartel was run by a [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]] known as [[Rinnrivin Di]], who operated from the planet [[Bastatha]]. After Yendor's request was made, the Senate debated whether Yendor's accusations were true and whether the Senate should act upon them. Feeling partially responsible that she was part of the government that allowed this to happen, Senator Organa volunteered to personally investigate Rinnrivin Di's cartel on Bastatha. She was pleased to think that she would see some action again before she retired, until Senator [[Ransolm Casterfo]], the junior senator from the Centrist planet [[Riosa]], suggested that the investigation to be bipartisan and volunteered to accompany Organa.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nSoon after the session of the Senate ended, Organa went to visit Casterfo in his office&mdash;contrary to senatorial protocol, where he would be expected to visit her in the morning. Upon her visit, Casterfo welcomed Organa into his office, which she discovered to be full of Imperial memorabilia. Disgusted by his infatuation with the Empire, Organa and Casterfo entered a heated debate where Casterfo showed his support not for Palpatine, but the dream of the Empire, and that he wished that the Empire had been reformed under better leadership. Organa began to argue that Palpatine was not the only problem with the Empire, and that he had only been a child while she was fighting in the war. Organa then left Casterfo's office, the two of them agreeing that C-3PO and the rest of Organa's staff would make arrangements for their [[Mission to Bastatha|trip to Bastatha]] at another time.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Mission to Bastatha====\n{{Quote|Rinnrivin Di, I presume?''\"<br>\"''Princess Leia Organa. I apologize for your unorthodox journey here. However, I thought you unlikely to accept a straightforward invitation|Leia's first meeting with Rinnrivin Di|Bloodline (novel)}}\nA few days later, Organa and Casterfo, along with Leia's chief of staff [[Greer Sonnel]], 16-year-old office intern [[Korr Sella]], X-wing pilot [[Joph Seastriker]], and C-3PO, began to prepare their trip to Bastatha. The trip on board Organa's personal ship the ''[[Mirrorbright]]'' was an awkward one, as Casterfo and Organa attempted to avoid each other after their confrontation in Casterfo's office earlier. However, by the time they reached the planet, Casterfo apologized for being insensitive to Organa's personal experiences in the war, and they agreed to leave the past in the past so that they could do what they came to do.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nOrgana and Casterfo remained civil with each other as they exited the ''Mirrorbright'' to greet the local authorities, and they were welcomed to Bastatha by Nikto [[Magistrate]]s [[Tosta]] and [[Xun]]. The senators and their staff were all welcomed to dinner, and they were taken to a luxurious casino. The group was offered a splendid meal, but Organa insisted on playing her hand in a game of [[Sabacc]]. The Niktos believed that she would likely lose some money in the challenging game, but Organa, having learned the game from the best, intended to impress her hosts with her cunning rather than her decorum.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nWhile Leia's actions won the favor of her Nikto hosts, Ransolm was uncomfortable with his colleague for fraternizing with what he regarded as \"lowlives.\" During their time at the casino, Leia noticed a party of visitors from the planet [[Daxam IV]]. One of the party was [[Arliz Hadrassian|an elderly woman]] who appeared to be watching her while trying to remain unnoticed. After exiting the casino, Organa and Casterfo argued about her style of fraternizing with constituents and the alleged \"terrorist\" activities of the Rebel Alliance. Later, Leia received news from Greer that a \"business delegation\" was coming to meet her.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nThis \"business delegation\" turned out to be a party of kidnappers sent by Rinnrivin. Without firing shots, Rinnrivin's underlings spirited Organa away on a [[hoversled]] for a private audience with Rinnrivin at [[Rinnrivin's headquarters|his underground headquarters]]. The crime lord attempted to ingratiate himself with the New Republic senator by serving vintage [[Toniray]] [[wine]] from Alderaan and presenting a [[holocube]] of her killing Jabba, an act which had won her the respect of the Nikto species, who called her \"Huttslayer.\" However, Leia rebuffed Rinnrivin's attempts to bribe her into persuading the New Republic to ease its ban on the sale of illegal [[spice]].<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nOrgana's meeting with Rinnrivin was interrupted by Casterfo, who had tracked her down using a [[Homing beacon|tracking device]] he had planted in her cloak. Following a brief scuffle with Rinnrivin's guards, the two senators escaped on a hoversled and alerted the Bastatha authorities. Rinnrivin and his henchmen escaped before the [[Bastatha security forces]] could secure his underground lair. However, Leia and her team managed to find information about Rinnrivin's operations including his funnelling of funds to shadow corporations in the Outer Rim. They suspected that Rinnrivin was part of a larger criminal network.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====First Senator and the Napkin Bombing====\nFollowing their return from Bastatha, Organa and Casterfo addressed the Galactic Senate and called for further investigations into Rinnrivin's cartel. Their speeches were greeted by partisan infighting with the Populists accusing Casterfo of endangering Leia's life and the Centrists accusing Leia of withholding critical information. Later, Lady Carise took the floor to advocate the creation of \"[[First Senator]],\" a powerful position that would wield considerable power over the economy and military. While many senators distrusted Lady Carise's motives, Casterfo managed to sway the Senate into adopting the motion by pointing to the endemic deadlock in the New Republic. As a result, the Populist attempt to block the motion was defeated.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nWhile Organa and her Populist colleagues [[Tai-Lin Garr]] and [[Varish Vicly]] were dismayed by the results, they decided to change tactics by nominating a Populist for First Senator in order to prevent a Centrist from holding that position. Since Organa was considered a powerful and charismatic senator, Tai-Lin and Varish convinced her to run for First Senator. Despite her reluctance, Organa agreed to form an exploratory committee to consider the possibility at the urging of her staff including C-3PO, her aide Korrie, and her pilot Sonnel. Leia later contacted her husband, Han, by hologram to discuss the recent developments. Though Han expressed disappointment, he understood her devotion to keeping the New Republic in one piece.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n[[File:First_Senator_Leia_poster.png|thumb|left|200px|A propaganda poster supporting Organa as First Senator]]\nThe following day, Leia met with Lady Carise to conclude their discussion on the Supreme governorship of Birren. During the meeting, Leia revealed that she had been adopted by Bail and Breha Organa. Since Leia and her son Ben had little interest in inheriting the governorship, Leia agreed to support Lady Carise's claim to the title in return for keeping her parentage a secret. While conversing with Lady Carise, Organa admitted that the position of First Senator might not be such a bad idea. In addition, Leia dispatched Greer and the starfighter pilot Seastriker to the watery planet [[Pamarthe]] to investigate whether Rinnrivin was hiring pilots from there. Instead, the two Republic pilots learned that Rinnrivin was hiring a shadowy militia group known as the [[Amaxine warriors (New Republic Era)|Amaxine warriors]], who operated from a base in the Centrist world Daxam IV.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nGreer and Joph discussed their findings with Leia and noted that the Amaxines tended to operate in predominantly Centrist worlds. Suspecting that several Centrist senators were colluding with Rinnrivin's cartel, Organa decided to turn to Casterfo for help since she regarded him as the only Centrist she could trust. During a private dinner at Hosnian Prime's [[hanging gardens]], Organa discussed her concerns about the connection between the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel with Casterfo and convinced the senator to visit Daxam IV. During the dinner, Casterfo confided in Leia and told her about his harsh childhood on Riosa, which had led him to hate Darth Vader and the Emperor. In return, Leia told him about her torture at the hands of Vader but omitted the fact that the late Sith Lord was her father. As a result of this meeting, the two became unlikely friends.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nThe following day, Leia and Tai-Lin met in the New Republic senatorial complex's banquet hall to discuss her planned nomination for First Senator. There, Leia discovered a hand-scribbled note with the word \"RUN.\" Acting quickly, Leia managed to evacuate the senatorial complex's conference hall moments before a bomb destroyed half of the building. While nobody was killed due to Leia's quick thinking, several senators and staff were wounded by the blast. Leia survived the bombing unscathed apart from some concussion. After receiving treatment for concussion, Leia transmitted a voice message for again to assure him that she was safe.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Missions to Ryloth and Harloff Minor====\nThe Populists and Centrists accused each other of staging the bombing for political capital. Despite this bickering, Organa and Casterfo resolved to continue their investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines. After seeing news footage showing an alleged Twi'lek bomber, Leia decided to travel to Ryloth to search the [[Ryloth archives|planet's archives]] with C-3PO, Korrie, and Joph for information about Rinnrivin's cartel. Meanwhile, Casterfo and Greer would travel to Daxam IV to investigate the Amaxine presence there under the pretext of purchasing an old Imperial artifact from a local dealer.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nOn Ryloth, Leia and her entourage were greeted by Emissary Yendor, a veteran of the Galactic Civil War who was familiar with the former rebel leader. In the Ryloth archives, Leia and her team discovered that Rinnrivin had been a lowly spice dealer who had risen to power under unusual circumstances in the past seven years. Leia and Korrie pondered whether Rinnrivin's sudden fortunes were connected to the Centrists. Later, Senator Organa attended a private dinner hosted by Yendor. In her absence, C-3PO, Joph, and Korrie contacted Casterfo, who informed them about Rinnrivin's secret satellites above Ryloth. C-3PO sliced into one of the satellites and discovered that Rinnrivin was hiding on the [[Expansion Region]] planet of [[Sibensko]]. While Leia was annoyed with Joph for acting without consulting her, she was pleased that he had pinned down Rinnrivin's location.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nAfter departing Ryloth, Leia and her team discovered that Rinnrivin was visiting the upmarket planet of [[Harloff Minor]], which lay near the former galactic capital Coruscant. Seeking to question him, Leia delayed her return to Hosnian Prime and took the ''Mirrorbright'' to Harloff Minor. Organa and Rinnrivin met at a comfortable restaurant. Rinnrivin denied any role in the \"Napkin Bombing\" and condemned the incident as a terrorist act. While Leia accepted Rinnrivin's compliment that she would make a worthy candidate for First Senator, she rebuffed his second attempt at bribery and also took the opportunity to return her \"Huttslayer\" holocube on the grounds that she did not need to be reminded of the past. However, Leia had secretly fitted the holocube with a transmitter to keep an eye on Rinnrivin's movements.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nUpon returning to Hosnian Prime, Organa learned that her colleague Varish was recovering from her injuries. She also received a hologram recording from her husband, who informed her that he was heading to the fourth stage of the [[Five Sabers]] race. After listening to news reports of the Populist and Centrist media blaming each other for the Napkin Bombing, Leia chatted with her aide Korrie, who feared the collapse of the New Republic. Addressing Korrie and Joph, she theorized that the current infighting in the Senate could lead to a schism. In private, Leia feared that another war was imminent.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nAfter Casterfo returned to Hosnian Prime later that night, the Senator briefed her about the Amaxine warriors he had encountered on Daxam IV. Casterfo explained that he had gained the trust of the Amaxines and convinced them that he was an Imperial sympathizer. He revealed that the Amaxine warriors had amassed considerable forces and [[starfighter]]s in preparation for a war. Having determined that the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel were connected, the two decided to investigate whether the Amaxine warriors were responsible for the Napkin Bombing. Rinnrivin also informed her that the Amaxines' main base was located on Sibensko, which was also Rinnrivin's hideout. Leia agreed to steer the official investigation into the Napkin Bombing in the \"right direction\" while Rinnrivin agreed to investigate whether his fellow Centrists were colluding with the Amaxines.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Secret revealed====\nWith Leia's approval, Joph and Greer traveled to the seedy space station of [[Chrome Citadel]] to arrange a smuggling \"cover job\" to Sibensko, which had a reputation as a seedy place. Since Leia's nomination as the Populist candidate for First Senator was scheduled to take place within a few weeks, Organa began to prepare for her trip to Sibensko. She discussed her travel plans with Senator Casterfo, who advised her that New Republic law prohibited them from using New Republic pilots and ships for illegal work such as traveling to a known criminal hub like Sibensko. Leia invited Casterfo to accompany her on this trip in order to give their mission more credibility in the eyes of the divided Galactic Senate.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nWhile Leia's friendship with Casterfo blossomed during this time, a major crisis emerged from an unexpected quarter. While visiting Birren, Lady Carise had uncovered a [[keepsake chest]] and a [[music box]] which revealed Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader. As a clandestine agent of the First Order and a leading Centrist politician, Lady Carise saw an opportunity to both create a wedge between Casterfo and Leia and to destroy Organa's political credibility. Knowing Casterfo's hatred for Darth Vader, she informed Casterfo about Leia's parentage.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nFeeling betrayed by Leia, Ransolm upstaged the Senate hearing on Organa's nomination for First Senator by revealing her true parentage as Darth Vader's daughter. After Casterfo presented her keepsake chest and music box as evidence, Leia confirmed that she was indeed Darth Vader's daughter. This revelation turned much of the Galactic Senate with the exception of her friends Tai-Lin Garr and Varish Vicly against her and effectively destroyed her political career. After barricading herself and her staff in her senate office, Leia consoled herself by watching a holographic recording of her late adopted father Bail Organa. She then penned a message to her son to comfort him about the recent revelations concerning their family's ancestry.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nWhile Korrie stormed off in outrage at Leia's perceived indiscretion, C-3PO along with Joph and Greer remained loyal to her. Leia and her remaining team resolved to stop Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxine warriors. The following day, Leia marched into Casterfo's office and confronted her former friend. Casterfo responded that he had been a fool for sharing his most personal and painful life stories with Leia, never guessing that she was Vader's daughter. When Leia revealed that she had not shared her true parentage with her son, Casterfo pointed out that Ben was no longer a child but a man. After destroying one of Casterfo's glass display cases and knocking a noodle carton out of a [[Service droid|servant droid's]] hands, Leia stormed out of Casterfo's office.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nAfter regaining her composure, Leia addressed the Galactic Senate to formally withdraw her nomination for First Senator and to seek permission for leave. She also took the opportunity to clarify her and her brother Luke Skywalker's origins as the offspring of the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, the man who had become Darth Vader. Organa also identified her birth mother as the late Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Following her speech, Lady Carise took the opportunity to cast doubt on Luke Skywalker's integrity since the Jedi Master had kept a low profile for many years. In response, Leia pointed out her brother's services for the Rebellion and the New Republic including his role in destroying the first Death Star.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nFortunately for Leia, Tai-Lin Garr spoke in Luke's defense and reiterated that the New Republic did not blame children for the sins of their parents. While accepting the withdrawal of Leia's candidacy, he defended Leia's past record and stressed that she retained his personal friendship and support. The Senate then discussed her request to obtain a brief leave of absence from her duties. After some deliberation, the Senate reluctantly approved her request. Guilt-stricken over his actions, Ransolm did not oppose her request and remained silent throughout the deliberations. Leia and her team then made preparations to depart on a junker ship for Sibensko. Despite Greer succumbing to a [[bloodburn]] attack, the team proceeded with their mission.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Mission to Sibensko====\nFor their [[mission to Sibensko]], Leia disguised herself as an indentured servant who wore heavy robe and veil. Greer and Joph posed as a Mandalorian and [[Ubese]] bounty hunter respectively, while C-3PO pretended to be Leia's minder. The New Republic team docked their junker ship in an underwater city in Sibensko's southern axis. Using a tracker, Leia detected that Rinnrivin was somewhere in the underwater city. Upon landing, Leia and team discovered that they were transporting a cargo of [[detonator]]s to Hosnian Prime. While Greer and Joph loaded the cargo, Leia and C-3PO headed into the city.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nThe two accessed a computer terminal in a cantina. C-3PO downloaded banking records proving that the Amaxine warriors had transferred billions of credits in start-up capital to Rinnrivin Di's cartel over the past seven years. In addition, C-3PO found that Rinnrivin was linked to nameless sources on Centrist worlds. Leia feared that the Amaxine warriors were planning a major military buildup or that a coalition of Centrist worlds was preparing for war. In addition, C-3PO uncovered information about a large Centrist base within the underwater city.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nLeia contacted Joph and informed him about the Amaxine military presence on Sibensko. She decided to send C-3PO back with his data to rendezvous with the pilots while she went to spy on the Amaxine military base. Since Joph and Greer were scheduled to depart in an hour, Organa planned to stay longer in order to spy on the Amaxines. C-3PO reluctantly left to return to the freighter. Before Leia could proceed further, she cornered by Rinnrivin and two of his bodyguards, who had detected Leia's tracking device on his holocube. Since Leia had accessed classified information regarding his operations, the crime lord intended to kill the intruders.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nHowever, Leia shot one of the Nikto henchmen with her blaster and then targeted the central strut supporting the hydraulic tunnel above Rinnrivin, crushing the crime lord and his remaining bodyguard to death. Leia then reiterated her orders for Joph and Greer to leave with C-3PO. Unknown to Leia, the Sibensko base served as the Amaxine warriors' headquarters and contained their entire army. Leia then took a lift down to the Amaxine base and discovered that it housed a squadron of starfighters. She then encountered six Amaxine warriors, who attempted to apprehend her. However, Organa fled up a landing platform that took her to the surface of the ocean.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nShortly thereafter, Leia was attacked by a [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing]] and [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing starfighter]]. Before the Amaxine starfighters could finish her off, Han arrived in a modified [[Racing starfighter|racer]] and shot down the Y-wing. After boarding Han's racer, the wife and husband shot down the remaining B-wing fighter, which crashed into the underwater city's ammunition depot. This triggered a massive explosion that wiped out the entire Amaxine base and eliminated the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel as threats to the New Republic. However, the explosion also destroyed much of the hard evidence on the two factions' financial records, which concealed their link to several Centrist senators and the First Order.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Warning the New Republic====\nAfter returning to Hosnian Prime, Leia confided about the political fallout resulting from the revelations of her parentage to her husband, Han Solo. While many of her former Populist allies had abandoned her for being Darth Vader's daughter, she expressed relief that Tai-Lin, Varish, and her former rebel comrades Ackbar, Nien Nunb, Lando, and Mon Mothma had stood by her. Leia also discussed her mixed feelings about Ransolm Casterfo's motives for betraying her. Solo advised his wife to resign from the Senate once her term was up and to join him traveling around the galaxy for a change. Leia then informed Han that she planned to address the Senate about her investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines but that she needed to obtain a quorum.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nDue to the political fallout resulting from the revelations of her parentage, Leia struggled to obtain a quorum to address the Senate. However, Casterfo cast a deciding vote in her favor. Leia related this turn in fortunes to her husband, who was preparing to depart for the hyperspace championship round of the Five Sabers which had been postponed due to family commitments. After Han had left, Leia discussed her plan to address the Senate with her remaining friends Tai-Lin and Varish, who express suspicion about Ransolm's motives for voting in her favor. Tai-Lin then informed Leia that he was planning to stand as the Populist nominee for First Senator.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nThe following day, Senator Organa briefed the Galactic Senate about her investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxine warriors. She revealed that Rinnrivin had been funding the Amaxine warriors, who were responsible for the Napkin Bombing. To back her testimony, Organa's chief of staff supplied each senator with an extensive data packet. Leia's testimony evoked finger-blaming between the Populists and Centrists. In addition, Organa submitted visual logs from her Sibensko mission and reported that Amaxine base had been destroyed during the firefight with the Amaxine fighters. When a senator accused her of justifying murder like her father, Leia warned the Senate that her investigation had foiled a conspiracy by the Amaxine warriors to wage war on the Republic. She warned that the Amaxine warriors were not the only threat to the New Republic and urged her colleagues to end their political bickering and not to let their views of her cloud the evidence.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nLeia's former friend Senator Casterfo then addressed the Senate to support her findings. He vouched for Senator Organa's integrity and then offered visual logs from his trip to Daxam IV, which showed the Amaxines' training facilities and some measure of their military might. He also testified that the Amaxine warriors advocated war and admired the \"Old Empire.\" Casterfo's testimony vindicated Leia's findings and aroused several senators. Due to Casterfo's courage and selflessness, Casterfo regained Leia's respect. However, Casterfo's action earned the ire of Lady Carise, who was covertly working with the First Order to undermine the New Republic.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n====Tying up loose ends====\n{{Quote|The sun is setting on the New Republic. It's time for the Resistance to rise.|Leia Organa|Bloodline (novel)}}\nThe day after Senator Organa's final address to the Senate, Casterfo visited his former friend. The two reconciled with Casterfo praising her for her good work in the Sibensko mission. Ransolm then announced his intention to support further investigations into the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel. While Leia did not thank him for supporting her testimony, she praised the junior senator for putting the greater good ahead of his own political faction and ambitions. She told Casterfo that he was the kind of politician that the galaxy needed. With Leia's political career at an end, she counselled Casterfo to work with other like-minded senators to prevent a war, even if it meant leaving the Centrists. Casterfo agreed to do his best to protect the Republic before departing.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nTen days following her final speech to the Galactic Senate, Leia accompanied Tai-Lin Garr on his first campaign rally for the position of First Senator. While visiting one of Hosnian Prime's parks, Leia encountered her former aide Korr Sella, who apologized to the Senator for abandoning her. She offered to serve Organa again, a request which Leia accepted. While Tai-Lin was mingling with the crowd, Leia spotted Arliz Hadrassian, the woman she had earlier encounter on Bastatha and witnessed in Ransolm's holos of Daxam IV. Before Leia could react, Hadrassian [[Tai-Lin Garr's assassination|assassinated Tai-Lin]] with a blaster. Before turning the blaster on herself, Hadrassian told the Senator that she was lucky that Hadrassian was thinking strategically.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nFollowing Tai-Lin Garr's assassination, the Galactic Senate unanimously declared an official period of mourning. Based on the data from Sibensko, both Populist and Centrist senators believed that Hadrassian was the mastermind behind the Napkin Bombing, Rinnrivin's rise, and the Amaxines. While most senators believed that Hadrassian's suicide ended the danger to the Republic, Leia disagreed and urged the authorities to investigate the source of Hadrassian's money, pointing out that a former Imperial soldier and small-time businesswoman could not bankroll an entire militia. During [[Tai-Lin Garr's memorial service]], she raised the matter. However, her friend Varish was more concerned with mourning Tai-Lin Garr's loss.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nTwo days after Tai-Lin Garr's assassination, Leia heard a news report that her friend Casterfo had been arrested for aiding Hadrassian and the Amaxine warriors. After consulting Greer, Organa ascertained that the Centrists had framed Casterfo by planting fake footage of him shaking hands with Hadrassian. Before Casterfo was deported to face imprisonment, trial, and sentencing on his homeworld Riosa, Leia spoke to him and offered to help her former friend. While Casterfo was pessimistic that her help would succeed, he apologized for breaching Leia's trust. In return, Leia apologized for initially assuming that he was an Imperial loyalist. Based on her final conversation with Casterfo, Leia determined that the Centrists were behind the recent crisis and were eliminating dissenters among their ranks.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nBefore resigning as Senator, Leia took the opportunity to settle scores with Lady Carise for revealing her parentage and conspiring against Casterfo. On the grounds that Lady Carise had violated her oath to secrecy as Supreme Governor of Birren, Organa convinced the Elder Houses to strip the Lady of all her royal titles permanently. A smug Leia personally delivered the news to a distraught Carise and chastised the younger woman for her obsession with royalty and privilege. Later that evening, Leia organized a private meeting in the Senatorial complex hangar bay that was attended by several New Republic military personnel including Joph, Greer, Nunb, Ematt, Ackbar, Kalonia, Snap Wexley, and [[Zari Bangel]]. With the Galactic Senate too preoccupied with petty squabbles to defend the New Republic, Leia announced the formation of a new paramilitary organization called the [[Resistance]].<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\n===Resistance===\n{{Quote|You are a symbol of the Resistance and an inspiration to all soldiers who follow our cause and do their duty in hard times.|PZ-4CO, to Leia Organa|Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure}}\n[[File:Leia-organa_59f8c499.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Organa in the Resistance command center]]\nFollowing the formation of the Resistance, Leia Organa became its leader and began to be addressed as General rather than Princess.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> All of the [[Resistance High Command|Resistance leadership]] was made up of people whom had a personal connection to the General, including Ackbar, [[Idrosen Gawat]], and [[Amilyn Holdo]].<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> In the wake of the revelations about Leia and Luke's true parentage,<ref name=\"Bloodline\" /> her son Ben became obsessed with carrying on the legacy of Darth Vader, all the while under the influence of [[Snoke]], [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]].<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Ben [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed Skywalker's Jedi temple and his fellow students]], turned to the dark side, and became a [[Knights of Ren|Knight of Ren]].<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Abandoning his former identity, the renamed Kylo Ren assumed a high-ranking position in the First Order, a remnant of the Old Empire.

He accepted immediately, and in the following months, as he carried out missions for the Resistance,<ref name=\"BTA\" /> Dameron became one of Organa's most-trusted operatives.<ref name=\"DB:Poe\">{{Databank|poe-dameron|Poe Dameron|archivedate=20200607033228}}</ref> Eventually because of his skills and determination, Organa recruited him for [[Operation: Sabre Strike]] so that he would steal the ''[[Hevurion Grace]]'' (and its [[Navigation computer|navicomputer]] data) from its owner, [[Hevurion]] senator and First Order sympathizer [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]].<ref name=\"BTA\" />\n\n====Attera Campaign====\nWhile on a reconnaissance mission in the [[Atterra system|Attera System]], the bomber crew ''[[Hammer]] ''came into contact with [[Reeve Panzoro]] and his grandmother [[Casca Panzoro]]. They were then brought to D'Qar where they told General Leia about how the First Order was destroying their planet. Both of them were members of a local resistance group called [[Bravo Rising]]. Reeve told them about the supplies they needed most and Leia authorized the [[Atterra campaign|mission]]. The campaign would ultimately be successful, but at the loss of 3 [[MG-100 StarFortress SF-17]]s bombers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Search for Lor San Tekka====\n[[File:Poe-and-the-General.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Organa sends Resistance pilot Poe Dameron on a mission to find Lor San Tekka, who she believes may lead them to Luke.]]\nAfter he, [[Kar\u00e9 Kun]] and [[Iolo Arana]] completed the mission despite the odds, Organa assigned C-3PO to see what he could get from the flight computers while she congratulated Dameron. Afterwards, as he rested, Organa analyzed the information obtained from the ''Hevurion Grace''. The following morning, she summoned Dameron to her office, and asked what he felt about the dilemma, when he remembered the hopelessness of the [[Imperial Era]] that his parents had told him about. Thanks to him, she resolved to find her brother and restore hope to the galaxy. Organa then resolved to find [[Lor San Tekka]], who Organa believed held a clue to her brother's location.<ref name=\"BTA\" />\n\nFollowing Operation: Sabre Strike, General Organa dispatched Poe Dameron on a [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|quest]] to find the explorer Lor San Tekka. When Poe assured her that he knew what was at sake, she explained that he had grown up in a galaxy where the Empire had already been defeated and that he had only learned about the Empire from others. When Poe recounted his previous encounter with the First Order, the two agreed that the faction was not yet as powerful as the Old Empire. During the briefing, Organa praised Poe for intercepting information from the ''Hevurion Grace'' before it could reach Supreme Leader Snoke. She told Poe that they could not allow the First Order to find her brother, Luke Skywalker, at any cost.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 1\">[[Poe Dameron 1|''Poe Dameron'' 1]]</ref>\n\nLeia told Poe that Tekka held the key to finding Skywalker and that she trusted him to accomplish the quest. For the quest, Leia allowed Poe to select a small squadron consisting of four more pilots and a technician. Leia believed that Poe would not run into trouble due to D'Qar's remote location. When Poe reassured her that he would pick good people, Leia warned him to be careful since she knew that missions could fall apart easily. For the quest, Poe handpicked his fellow [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]] pilots Temmin Wexley, Kun, [[L'ulo L'ampar]], [[Jessika Pava]], and the technician [[Oddy Muva]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 1\" />\n\nFor their [[Mission to Ovanis|first mission]], Poe and his comrades traveled to the rocky planet [[Ovanis]] where Tekka had visited the [[Cr\u00e8che]] cult years earlier. However, Poe was followed by the [[First Order Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Terex]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 2\">[[Poe Dameron 2|''Poe Dameron'' 2]]</ref> With Leia's help, Poe and his comrades bribed their way into [[Megalox]] [[prison]] on the high-gravity world of [[Megalox Beta]]. Poe wanted to question Grakkus, who had encountered Lor San Tekka years ago. However, Terex followed them there as well.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\">[[Poe Dameron 4|''Poe Dameron'' 4]]</ref>\n\nAfter helping Grakkus escape offworld, Poe discussed the information that Grakkus had shared with General Organa. After reading the information on her [[datapad]], Leia opined that the information was legitimate. When Poe asked if he wanted her to take Black Squadron to visit the worlds that Lor San Tekka had traveled to, Leia confided that she suspected that a [[spy]] had been leaking Black Squadron's movements to the First Order.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 6\">[[Poe Dameron 6|''Poe Dameron'' 6]]</ref>\n\n====Spy games====\nPoe Dameron later embarked on a solo mission to obtain information about the First Order's illegal rearmament efforts in violation of the Galactic Concordance from the ''[[Galaxy Beacon]]'' journalist [[Suralinda Javos]]. Javos wanted to use the story to boost her own career. However, Javos and Poe were [[Skirmish on Pheryon|ambushed and captured]] by the First Order agent Lieutenant [[Weel]]. After escaping Weel, Javos returned with Poe to the Resistance base. General Organa met with Javos, who apologized for exploiting Poe. Experiencing a change of heart, Javos decided to join the Resistance and provide whatever information she had about the First Order.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 7\">[[Poe Dameron 7|''Poe Dameron'' 7]]</ref>\n\nLater, one of the [[Resistance spy droid network|Resistance's droid spies]] on the Outer Rim world of [[Kaddak]] obtained a trove of intelligence about the First Order including the location of Snoke. General Organa dispatched her spymaster C-3PO, Poe, and the technician Muva to Kaddak to recover the droid.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 8\">[[Poe Dameron 8|''Poe Dameron'' 8]]</ref> On Kaddak, they discovered the spy was the [[BX-series droid commando]] [[N1-ZX]], who insisted that he could disclose the information once he had been delivered back to the Resistance base.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 10\">[[Poe Dameron 10|''Poe Dameron'' 10]]</ref> Poe soon realized that this was disinformation planted by Terex to uncover the Resistance base and that Oddy Muva was a spy.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 11\">[[Poe Dameron 11|''Poe Dameron'' 11]]</ref> Black Squadron and Terex's [[Ranc gang]] proxies were subsequently involved in [[Battle over a desert planet|a battle]] over a [[Unidentified desert planet|desert planet]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 13\">[[Poe Dameron 13|''Poe Dameron'' 13]]</ref>\n\n====Starling in the Unknown Regions====\n{{Quote|When the galaxy is on the line, I have a way of skipping past the formalities of my youth.|Leia Organa to Vi Moradi|Phasma (novel)}}\nIn the midst of the cold war with the First Order, Organa Solo worked with spy [[Vi Moradi]], codenamed Starling, to gain information about the Order's movements throughout the Unknown Regions. After jumping out of hyperspace, Moradi provided vital information to Organa on an encoded comm frequency. The general provided one more set of coordinates for Vi to investigate. However, the First Order Star Destroyer ''[[Absolution]]'' promptly captured her, but after a lengthy interrogation, Moradi managed to escape with the First Order Captain [[Archex|Cardinal]].<ref name=\"Phasma\">[[Phasma (novel)]]</ref>\n\n====Map to Skywalker====\n{{Quote|I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here.|Han Solo to Leia Organa|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\nThirty years after the Battle of Endor,<ref name=\"GA\" /> with the two factions on the brink of war,<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Lor San Tekka finally made contact with the Resistance, informing them that he had the map to Luke Skywalker and was on the desert world of Jakku. Believing that her brother would solve their crisis, Organa thought the planet was a perfect location, surmising that the First Order would be defeated on the same world as the Empire. Meeting with Dameron, she informed the pilot that he was being tasked with retrieving the map, but she also stated he would go without the help of Black Squadron, fearing that four [[X-wing starfighter|X-wing fighters]] arriving on the planet would spread word of their sensitive mission. Though she believed the [[Attack on Tuanul|mission to Jakku]] could be their only chance to get an advantage over the First Order,<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 26\">[[Poe Dameron 26|''Poe Dameron'' 26]]</ref> their enemy also arrived in and attacked the town of [[Tuanul]]. Seeing this, Dameron gave his astromech droid, [[BB-8]], the map fragment. Additionally, the First Order<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> attack squadron<ref name=\"TFA-novel\">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> had been led by none other than Organa's son, who was still using the name \"Kylo Ren.\" As he spoke with Tekka, the old explorer told Ren that he could not deny his heritage as the son of Organa and Solo, but the dark side warrior murdered Tekka, took Dameron captive, and had the village massacred.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nOrgana, who had been asked to record her memoirs by [[PZ-4CO]], as prepared by Major Ematt, and had rejected all seven of her requests in forty-four days, agreed to pass on a lesson about duty as regards to Operation Yellow Moon. When she was finished, Ematt interrupted them, for she was awaited in the [[D'Qar]] command center.<ref name=\"Moving Target\" /> Around the same time, the First Order took over the refueling station ''[[Colossus]]''. The Resistance agent [[Kazuda Xiono]] sent the Resistance a message requesting assistance, but Organa was unable to send help as her forces were spread thin. But she did give Kazudua the coordinates to the Resistance base at the planet, D'Qar. The she wished that the Force be with Xiono in her reply.<ref name=\"Descent\">{{Resistance|Descent (episode)|Descent}}</ref> As they waited for news, Organa conversed quietly with Captain Snap Wexley and an attendant droid, until Lieutenant [[Taslin Brance]] handed her a readout that informed her that Tuanul had been wiped out, Tekka had died, and Dameron's X-wing fighter had been destroyed, which would have likely killed him as well. However, she suspected BB-8 had survived and told C-3PO to use the tracking system to locate the spherical droid. Afterwards, she met with her personal envoy, Commander Korr Sella, and sent her to the Senate to try and convince them to take action against the First Order.<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" />\n\nElsewhere, Dameron and BB-8 had indeed survived, with the former having escaped Ren's command ship, a [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] named the ''[[Finalizer]]'', with the help of a treasonous stormtrooper, who he gave the name [[Finn]]. The two were separated, but Finn met up with BB-8 and a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] in [[Niima Outpost]]. They escaped the First Order aboard a ship very familiar to Organa, the ''Millennium Falcon'' itself, leading to them being found by none other than Chewbacca and Organa's husband, Han Solo. Because the two smugglers took the trio to Maz Kanata's [[Takodana Castle|castle]] on the planet of [[Takodana]],<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> C-3PO located BB-8 within the castle thanks to his droid network. Alerted to the finding, Organa prepared to recover the droid until news reached her<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" /> that the First Order had used its superweapon, [[Starkiller Base]], to [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroy]] the [[Hosnian system]],<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> then-current seat of the New Republic.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" /> Dameron managed to return to D'Qar aboard the ''[[Beloved Bophine]]'' but dreaded reporting his failure to Organa. When he met with her, Dameron reported what had happened, including that he had escaped imprisonment with the help of a treasonous stormtrooper. Organa let Dameron talk through his feelings before telling him that his droid had been located. Understanding that there was a bounty on the droid and knowing the type of clientele Kanata's castle attracted, Organa told him that the First Order likely knew BB-8's location as well, meaning they needed to launch their operation fast.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 26\" />\n\nAfter Organa felt a [[disturbance in the Force]], she deployed a Resistance squadron to Kanata's castle, with the recently returned Dameron as its leader.<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" /> In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Takodana]], Organa, C-3PO, and a team of Resistance troops arrived at the ruins of Kanata's Castle in a [[Resistance transport|transport ship]], and she saw Chewbacca and Solo upon exiting the craft. Though their meeting was briefly interrupted by C-3PO, the protocol droid quickly left after realizing she and Solo wanted to speak, giving Organa and her husband the chance to reunite<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> for the first time in years.<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" /> The two briefly flirted about their appearances before Chewbacca greeted her, and Solo then told his wife that he had seen their son, Kylo Ren, during the battle.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> He also told her about Finn, who was the very stormtrooper who had helped Dameron escape, and Rey, who had tried to take BB-8 back to the Resistance, but that the latter had been abducted by Ren on Takodana. At some point he also warned her that they would be unable to find her brother with the map BB-8 had recovered,<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" /> as Solo had already seen that it was an incomplete fragment. After traveling back to D'Qar, Dameron, now reunited with Finn, brought the former stormtrooper to see Organa as she was speaking with several other Resistance members. She complimented him on deserting the First Order and saving Dameron, but, when he mentioned that Rey had been taken captive, she revealed that Solo had told her about the young woman and apologized for what had happened.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nDesperate for any information about Starkiller Base, which was the very location Rey had been taken, Organa promised Finn that she would to do everything she could to help her, though she noted he first needed to tell them everything he could about the superweapon.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Afterwards, Organa conversed with other senior Resistance officers, and using Finn's information about Starkiller, they planned an [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack on the superweapon]],<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" /> the location of which they learned by tracking the trajectory of the shots that destroyed the Hosnian system. Organa had tasked Wexley, Kar\u00e9 Kun, and Jessika Pava with putting together a reconnaissance run on Starkiller Base. During the flight, as Wexley's [[Unidentified Resistance recon pod|recon pod]] failed, Kun recalled that Organa had once stated every heist needed luck, telling Wexley that he was not out of it yet. Shortly afterward, Wexley would manage to pilot his pod back to her X-wing.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 27\">[[Poe Dameron 27|''Poe Dameron'' 27]]</ref> Elsewhere, at the [[Resistance base]], while Organa and the others waited for Wexley<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" /> and Kun<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 27\" /> to return from the flight,<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" /> C-3PO informed her that the map BB-8 was carrying was only a fragment and that it matched no system on record. Organa thought she had been foolish to think she could find her brother, but she tried to avoid Solo after he started speaking to her. Shortly after, however, they finally talked about their son, with Organa expressing that she wanted him back. She told her husband that he could succeed where Skywalker had failed, as her brother was only a Jedi, while he was Ren's father. Afterward, at a Resistance briefing discussing Wexley's recon mission, Organa was informed that the First Order was charging their superweapon to target their system. Thus, she agreed with Solo's idea to \"blow up\" the weapon, prompting the Resistance attack plan to destroy the base's [[thermal oscillator]] in [[Precinct 47]]. Solo also agreed to take Finn to the planet to disable its defensive shields, though he refused to tell Organa how he planned on getting the ''Falcon'' onto the base, citing that she would not like the strategy.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[File:Han_and_Leia_TFA.png|thumb|right|300px|Organa and Solo are reunited.]]\nAs the Resistance prepared for its starfighter attack run, Solo was about to depart to Starkiller Base with Chewbacca and Finn when Organa approached him. They both recognized they still loved each other even after everything that happened; Organa asked him to try and bring Ben back home if he saw him. Thus, Solo departed to Starkiller Base and successfully arrived using the strategy he had not wanted to tell her: making their landing approach at lightspeed to get through the shield's fractional refresh rate. Yet during the next phases of the battle, as she oversaw the operation, she felt Solo's death at the hands of their son through the Force and collapsed into a chair in grief as curious and concerned Resistance personnel watched. However, Solo's actions had allowed the starfighter attack, led by Dameron, to destroy the oscillator and, with it, Starkiller Base.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> As Dameron and his squadron flew away from the oscillator, Poe contacted Leia, telling her of the target's destruction. Leia, reeling from the loss of Han, ordered Poe and his squadron to head back immediately, citing the fact that the loss of Black Squadron would take away the Resistance's ability to fight at all. Despite her protests, however, Poe and the squadron continued with rescue efforts for the Resistance's ground team.<ref name=\"TFA-novel\" />\n\n[[File:LeiaMTFBWY.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Organa wishes Rey luck as she sets out to find Skywalker.]]\nWhen those who had been involved at Starkiller Base arrived back at the Resistance base, Organa gave Rey, who had witnessed Han's death, a sympathetic hug. Upon their return, it was revealed that R2-D2 had the rest of BB-8's missing part of the map that would reveal Skywalker's location. Organa looked on with fellow members of the Resistance as the two hologram maps fit together, revealing the location of her brother. Sometime after, Organa wished Rey luck by telling her \"[[May the Force be with you]]\" before she departed D'Qar. Organa and the rest of the resistance bid Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 goodbye as they set off in search of Skywalker.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nAt some point following the Battle of Starkiller Base Organa wrote an entry in the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'', a logbook that had passed through the hands of many criminal figures before ending up in Solo's possession for the third time. In the ''Guide'', Organa reflected on her and Han's relationship, and wrote that she was putting the logbook back in the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref>\n\n====Evacuation of D'Qar====\nIn the wake of the destruction of Starkiller Base, the Resistance was forced to abandon their base on D'Qar, fearing a counterattack from the First Order. Organa commanded the Resistance fleet from the cruiser [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']], while Dameron was intended to distract First Order forces long enough for the Resistance transports to escape. The escape was interrupted by the arrival of a First Order fleet consisting of several ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers and one [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|''Mandator IV''-class Siege Dreadnought]], the latter of whose defense systems were neutralized by Dameron shortly after the base had been completely evacuated.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>\n\n[[File:LeiaExitingHyperspace.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Leia aboard the ''Raddus'' as the Resistance cruiser exits hyperspace]]\nThough the fleet was able to jump to hyperspace, Dameron disobeyed Organa's direct order not to continue with any further attacks on the dreadnought, resulting in casualties that reduced Resistance forces to 400 personnel aboard four ships. Furious at the losses, Organa demoted Dameron to Captain, slapping him. Shortly after, the fleet was attacked by a First Order armada led by Snoke's ship, the [[Mega-class Star Dreadnought|''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Supremacy]]'', and Organa realized that they had somehow been tracked through lightspeed. In the midst of the attack on the ''Raddus'', the ship's bridge was targeted by a [[Kylo Ren's personal squadron|squadron]] of TIE fighters led by Kylo Ren. Sensing his mother aboard the ship, Ren hesitated to fire, as Leia also sensed his presence. However, Ren's escorts took the shot instead, and Leia closed her eyes as the torpedoes obliterated the bridge, killing Ackbar and many of the other Resistance leaders and blowing Leia out into the vacuum of space.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nDespite having been ejected into the lethal vacuum without an [[EVA suit]], Leia managed to survive by using the Force to protect her body.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Floating in space, Organa questioned whether this was the end of her freedom-fighting lifetime even though Luke had taught her that the future was always in motion and difficult to see. However, she recalled that every time she used the Force to see a glimpse of her own future, it never seemed clear, concluding that there would not be a good ending for her anyway.<ref name=\"TLJ Comic 2\">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 2|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 2]]</ref> Knowing she still needed to return a [[S-thread transmitter bracelet|beacon]] to the ''Raddus'' so that Rey could find the Resistance and bring Luke back with her,<ref name=\"TLJ Junior Novel\">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Leia propelled herself back to the ship to use the short corridor leading to the bridge as an [[airlock]] and was let back in by Finn, Dameron, and [[Kaydel Ko Connix]]. The exposure left her critically injured and hospitalized, leaving her old friend Vice Admiral [[Amilyn Holdo]] in command of the remaining Resistance forces. Of everyone on the bridge when the torpedoes hit, Organa was the only survivor.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n====Battle of Crait====\n{{Quote|I held out hope for so long, but&hellip; I know my son is gone.''\"<br>\"''No one's ever really gone.|Leia and Luke Skywalker regarding her son, Ben Solo|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}\n[[File:Leia_on_Crait.png|thumb|left|300px|Leia in the brief calm moments before the Battle of Crait]]\nThough incapacitated, Leia shared brief mental contact with Luke, who had reopened his previously closed connection to the Force, and she said her brother's name. Shortly thereafter, Leia awakened, seemingly recovered, but having previously been exposed to the hazards of outer space, she suffered from a lack of oxygen to her tissue and solar radiation.<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> After discovering that Dameron and some of the other crew members had revolted against Holdo and were holding her hostage in disapproval of her leadership, Organa neutralized Poe and joined the remainder of the Resistance forces, who were evacuating the ''Raddus'' as there was no chance to destroy the ''Supremacy''. Holdo offered to stay behind, eventually sacrificing herself to ram the ''Raddus'' into the ''Supremacy'' at lightspeed, cleaving it in half and destroying much of its escort fleet instantly.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nThe remaining Resistance forces escaped to an old Rebel Alliance base on the planet Crait, which was subsequently [[Battle of Crait|attacked]] by the First Order after Resistance fighters Finn and [[Rose Tico]] were betrayed by a slicer named [[DJ]]. During the battle, the Resistance broadcasted a distress signal to their allies, but received no response, with Leia lamenting that the galaxy had lost hope.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_and_Leia_one_last_time.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Luke and Leia reunite for the last time.]]\nIn that moment, she was reunited with her brother Luke via [[Force projection]], during which she was comforted and given [[Han Solo's dice]] from the ''Millennium Falcon''. Her brother reassured her that \"no one's ever really gone\" before engaging in combat with Kylo Ren, thus allowing Leia and the others to escape, leaving the dice on the floor of the base. Collapsing from the mental toil required to sustain such a lifelike illusion, Luke died on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. However, he died contented and at peace, which Leia sensed.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n===Rebuilding the Resistance===\n====Aboard the ''Falcon''====\n{{Quote|How do we build a rebellion from this?''\"<br>\"''We have everything we need.|Rey and Leia Organa shortly after the Battle of Crait|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}\n[[File:Leia_and_Rey_on_the_Falcon.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa reassures Rey that they have everything they need to rebuild the Resistance.]]\nMeanwhile, Organa and the others escaped on the ''Falcon''. Rey, reunited at last with Organa, expressed her doubts in what was left of the Resistance. Organa, however, reassured Rey that the rebellion had everything necessary to rise again.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Shortly afterward, she turned to Chewbacca and noted that, with her brother and husband dead, it was just them now.<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\" />\n\nNow safe from the First Order, Leia and Chewbacca sat in the cockpit while the ''Falcon'' traveled through hyperspace. Sitting in the co-pilot's seat, Leia remembered her husband sitting in the captain's seat, leading her to tell Chewbacca that it was just echoes that she was seeing. Then, Nunb arrived, and Leia asked him to take her seat as she left the cockpit, saying that he had as much right to sit in the co-pilot's seat. Arriving at the room where Poe, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 were reunited, she heard Poe saying that the Force wasn't with him, leading her to reveal that the Force was with all of them, defining it as \"life's music, the song they made,\" making Finn realize that he would never understand how the Force worked. She then stated that it was good that they were meeting each other and that she needed to rest due to her condition not being a hundred percent, asking Dameron to meet her afterward to talk with him.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 27\">[[Poe Dameron 27|''Poe Dameron'' 27]]</ref>\n\n====Searching for old allies====\nAfter the Resistance's devastating losses of their leadership, Organa decided that the Resistance needed to begin rebuilding by recruiting new leadership. She dispatched Poe and Black Squadron to search for potential allies.<ref name=\"RR\">''[[Resistance Reborn]]''</ref>\n\nAfter hearing messages from his teammates of Black Squadron, who went to the planet [[Ikkrukk]] to search for more allies and got involved in a fight against First Order forces commanded by Colonel [[Barrut]], Dameron went to talk with Organa, begging her to let him go to Ikkrukk to save his friends. Leia refused, however, acknowledging that the First Order military was immense in spite of damaging them a little, knowing that every passing moment strengthened their hold on the galaxy, assuring Dameron that her decision was perfect and that if she committed another mistake, it would be all over. To convince Dameron that she did care for the pilots, Organa assured him that his friends had been crucial for several missions and that they were her friends too in addition to being soldiers, but that they knew the risks.<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\nSubsequently, Organa pondered whether it was worth taking the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Ikkrukk and risking other members, not knowing if they needed them despite her wishes to have them. As Poe reminded her that they said that no one was left behind, Organa responded that for a third time, she was an old woman who was to rally a galaxy against impossible odds, leading Dameron to tell her that the message they needed to show the galaxy was that if they joined the Resistance, no one would be left behind. Realizing that Poe was right, Leia promoted him back to Commander and gave him the authorization to go to rescue his friends, wishing the Force to accompany him, but didn't allow him to take the ''Falcon''. On Ikkrukk, Black Squadron defeated a small First Order force, but did not gain it as an ally, as many of the planet's leaders were afraid of the First Order.<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\nUpon the discovery that many former rebels and other potential allies had disappeared without explanation, Organa sent [[Temmin Wexley]] and [[Kar\u00e9 Kun]] to recruit Wedge Antilles and [[Norra Wexley]] to join them while she and her allies turned to Ryloth for a temporary base. On Ryloth, Leia convinced her old friend Yendor, a former rebel pilot and the head of the Ryloth Defense Authority, to temporarily hide them on Ryloth. Organa was offered a lavish room within the RDA's headquarters by Yendor's son [[Charth Brethen]], but she declined the offer in order to be closer to her people.<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\nAfter more Resistance recruits arrived, Organa sent a team, including Dameron, the Wexleys, and Antilles, to [[Corellia]] to recover a stolen First Order list of potential Resistance sympathizers from the Correllian [[Collective]]. While on Corellia, the team liberated a group of prisoners, including Organa's former friend and fellow New Republic Senator Ransolm Casterfo. Organa had also tasked a [[Dross Squadron|Resistance team]] under the command of Shriv Suurgav to [[Mission to Bracca (Resistance)|steal]] starfighters from the planet of [[Bracca]].<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\nAlthough the Ryloth government did not oppose the Resistance, they did not support their temporary refuge on Ryloth. The Ryloth Defense Authority was not officially controlled or connected to the government and permitted the Resistance to remain without needing the approval of the planetary government. However, eventually, the First Order was tipped off that the Ryloth Defense Authority was hiding the Resistance at their secret base. The Authority and remaining Resistance troops planned a defense and retreat of the base. During the retreat, Yendor's daughter, [[Hahnee Brethen]], was killed assisting Organa's escape. Organa told Yendor over comlink about the death of his daughter, as she felt she owed it to him to be the one to tell him. Organa, Rey, Yendor, and the other Resistance members escaped Ryloth, traveling to a location supplied by the Collective. They reunited with the Corellia and Bracca teams, and Organa was able to reunite with Casterfo.<ref name=\"RR\" />\n\n====Mission to Mon Cala====\n{{Quote|Instead of just waiting around, I think it's time for me to do something I should have done a while ago.

Leia remained there until she got the news from Lieutenant Connix that the planet of [[Tah'Nuhna]] had been [[Destruction of Tah'Nuhna|destroyed]] by the First Order. After hearing this, the general knew what she had to do. She told Chewbacca and Rose to prepare the ''Falcon'', which she boarded. She went and picked up Rey, who'd provoked a fight with a massive [[Anoatian pit beast]], and then she [[Mission to Mon Cala|went]] to [[Mon Cala]] to see if they would assist her cause.<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref> After a brief scuffle there, she met with Admiral Ackbar's son [[Aftab Ackbar]] and visited the [[Mourning Shrines]] with him.<ref name=\"Allegiance 2\">[[Allegiance 2|''Allegiance'' 2]]</ref>\n\n====Meeting on Garel====\nNot long after, Leia undertook an undercover mission to Garel alongside Dameron, C-3PO, R2-D2 and BB-8 in order to meet with a weapons supplier. Upon landing in the [[Garel City Spaceport]], C-3PO began to explain their odds of a successful meeting with the weapons supplier as Dameron attempted to cut him off, which prompted Leia to explain to Dameron that the protocol droid just wanted to assist. After a snarky remark from Dameron in response, Leia exited their stolen [[AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport|First Order transport]] with Dameron in tow, but not before ordering the droids to remain on the ship to stay out of trouble. However, this order would soon be ignored, as BB-8 and R2-D2 received a distress call from what they thought was a local militia opposed to the First Order. However, they soon discovered that, in reality, it was a little [[Duros]] girl named [[Likana]]<ref name=\"Secret Agent Droids 1\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=27|story=[[Secret Agent Droids, Part 1]]}}</ref> who would go on to assist them in sabotaging a First Order communications tower to stop the test of a new communications system.<ref name=\"Secret Agent Droids 3\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=27|story=[[Secret Agent Droids, Part 1]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning to their stolen transport, C-3PO informed Leia and Dameron of their story. Understanding that C-3PO was unable to lie, she was able to believe his wild story. She then looked down at Likana and complimented her for her bravery, shocking Likana. Even so, however, Leia advised her not to make a habit of putting herself at risk like she had before turning to Dameron and referencing his reckless actions aboard the ''Raddus''. After Dameron scolded C-3PO for the droid's own reckless actions, the protocol droid instead offered up a counterargument in that they were all part of the Resistance as Leia smiled.<ref name=\"Secret Agent Droids 3\" />\n\n===Training Rey===\n{{Quote|I'm starting to think it isn't possible&hellip;to hear the voices of the Jedi who came before.''\"<br>\"''Nothing's impossible.''\"<br>\"''Nothing's impossible. I'm gonna run the training course.|Rey and Leia Organa|Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker}}\nSometime after the Resistance's escape from Crait, Organa took Rey as her apprentice, teaching her in the ways of the Force. Organa knew that Rey was the biological granddaughter of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and trained her despite her knowledge of this fact, knowing from her own experience that some things were stronger than blood.<ref name=\"TROS\" /> She trained Rey to the best of her ability, knowing she was no Jedi Master, but had still learned from the best, her brother Luke, and had even heard the voices of Obi-Wan and Yoda over the years of her life.<ref name=\"TROSEE\" />\n\n===Palpatine's return===\n{{Quote|So, Palpatine's been out there all this time.

The Resistance learned from [[Armitage Hux]] that the Emperor had indeed returned from the dead and was allied with the First Order. They discovered that Sidious and his [[Sith Eternal]] [[Final Order|fleet]] were located on [[Exegol]]. General Organa allowed Rey and her team to go in search of the mysterious planet.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n===Saving Ben===\n{{Quote|Ben.|Leia Skywalker Organa Solo, calling out to her son before passing away|Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker}}\n[[File:LeiaFinalMoments-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|As a last act of love, Leia Skywalker Organa Solo reached out to her son in an attempt to bring him back to the light.]]\nRey's search for Exegol took her to the wreckage of the second Death Star on the ocean moon of [[Kef Bir]], where she engaged in a duel with Kylo Ren. During the fight, Organa sensed the confrontation and realized what she must do to save her son, Ben Solo. Prior to that moment, Leia had kept a secret: unknown to anyone but herself, Leia's attempt to save herself from the vacuum of space during the attack on the ''Raddus'' had taken a heavy toll on her. In the intervening months, her health had continually deteriorated and she would constantly hear her brother's urging to let go and be one with the Force, an action she consistently resisted as she did not wish to leave Rey nor the rest of the Resistance without first preparing them adequately. Upon sensing the confrontation, however, Organa knew that it was time.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nAfter being led to her quarters by Lieutenant Connix, Organa used the last of her strength to reach out with the Force and call out Kylo's birth name to him. Before doing so, she let the voices and faces of her family surround her, even seeing the face of Anakin Skywalker. In that moment, she accepted her father's apology and returned his love, finally reconciling with him as she had never before.<ref name=\"Rise Junior Novel\">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Upon calling for Ben through the Force, Organa collapsed and died, the last of her strength spent. The only witness to her death was R2-D2, who proved true loyalty to her at that moment, as he had also been present at her birth. Organa's final act helped to redeem her son.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|It's too late. She's gone.''\"<br>\"''Your mother's gone.

The Skywalker legacy was given to Rey, while Dameron would carry on the Organa legacy as the new leader of the Resistance, and for Ben she wanted her son to reclaim his legacy as a Solo.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nRey fled to Ahch-To after she decided to give up her mission and live in exile. Luke Skywalker then appeared as a Force ghost and told her that he had been wrong for exiling himself there and that she must confront her grandfather, Darth Sidious. Skywalker then revealed Leia's lightsaber to Rey and told her that she should take both weapons to Exegol.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nUpon learning of Leia's death, Poe Dameron and Chewbacca were struck by her loss. Chewbacca in particular was hugely affected, crying out in grief. A shadow of doubt began to hover around Poe as they considered whether they could still achieve the mission without her guidance. Lando Calrissian approached Poe and offered advice on how they had once defeated an Empire with nothing.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nAfter his redemption, Ben Solo traveled to Exegol to confront Darth Sidious with Rey. Together, they were overpowered by Sidious, who drained the life force from the pair. However, Rey eventually rose up and destroyed Sidious, by using both Anakin and Leia's lightsabers to reflect Force lightning back on him. Rey was empowered by generations of Jedi that had passed into the Force that resided within her, Organa's voice one of those that encouraged her to act. This act took all of Rey's strength, however, and left her body lifeless. Ben Solo was able to heal and revive Rey, albeit at the cost of his own life force. When Ben Solo's body disappeared, Organa's body back on Ajan Kloss became one with the Force simultaneously as Maz Kanata looked on.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n[[File:Skywalkers-TROS.png|thumb|left|250px|The Skywalker twins were reunited in death, becoming one with the Force.]]\nLater, Rey took both Skywalker's and Organa's lightsabers to Tatooine and buried them at the [[Lars Homestead|Lars moisture farm]], and then ignited [[Rey's lightsaber|her own lightsaber]]. When asked her name by an [[Unidentified Tatooine elder|elder]], the Force ghosts of Skywalker and Organa appeared in the distance, giving her their approval that she was family to them. Finally acknowledging where she belonged, she replied that her name was Rey Skywalker.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\nOne [[century]] after the Battle of Hoth, the Exogorth Sy-O, which Organa and her friends had briefly hid from the Empire inside of in the Hoth asteroid belt, remained confident it would meet them again, believing the atoms that had once made up their bodies were no different from the people themselves. It remembered feeling the Force in Organa, although Sy-O did not know the word to describe the energy field, and believed it would find them again through the Force, confident they would laugh together at their past griefs and that they would come to know each other.<ref name=\"This Is No Cave\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I don't doubt your capabilities, not even for a moment.

Growing up in the early days of the rebellion, she became skilled at keeping secrets, a trait beneficial to the greater good but detrimental to those around her.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> Her close friend Raymus Antilles recognized her as an ever enigmatic individual, never revealing more than was necessary to her allies in order to ensure their protection.<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\nSmart, fierce, and headstrong, Organa would accomplish whatever task she imposed on herself, for she would put duty before her personal needs&mdash;likely as a result of her upbringing.<ref name=\"PL2\" /><ref name=\"Moving Target\" /> She only \"gave as good as she got,\" which was one of the reasons Han Solo had taken a liking to her.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\" /> In spite of her self-discipline, Organa had a fiery temper she often struggled to control and was eager to prove herself, to be recognized for what she could do instead of for her title of nobility.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> Certain individuals of the Rebel Alliance gossiped about Organa's perceived coldness, with some even describing her as an \"ice princess.\" Rebels such as [[Miara Larte]], however, recognized the great burdens Leia faced in service to the Alliance and felt no need to judge how the princess carried herself.<ref name=\"By Whatever Sun\">{{Shortstory|story=By Whatever Sun|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\nDespite her commitment to Alderaan's values of pacifism, Organa believed in self-defense and in fiercely fighting for the galaxy's freedom.<ref name=\"PL5\" /> She never cared much for being royalty, for her priority was to help those who needed her, and not wealth nor recognition.<ref name=\"PL5\" /> A woman of action, eager to get things done and making positive differences in the galaxy, Leia was impatient, a trait she shared with her brother, Luke.<ref name=\"Moving Target\" /> He believed that Leia's strength of will, which allowed her to continue on despite events such as the destruction of Alderaan and the loss of her son, was a manifestation of her power in the Force.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" /> However, she also admitted to herself that some of her strength was fueled by desperation and even hatred at times.<ref name=\"Bloodline\" />\n\nLeia immensely regretted that her actions on the first Death Star indirectly led to the destruction of her homeworld. She was conscious of the fact that she alienated many people because of that. Constantly questioning whether or not she did the right thing, she came to the realization that she would willingly sacrifice those innocent lives again if it meant stopping the Empire. In her eyes, the cause was greater than any one person.<ref name=\"SWA2\" /> As Leia grew older, however, she placed more value in protecting lives than destroying her enemies; \"jumping in an X-wing and blowing something up\" could not be a winning strategy against forces like the First Order if there were no people to fight for the cause. She had the wisdom to realize that the Resistance having a leader with this foresight was better than having a hero who took unnecessary risks.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Aware of how others looked to her for leadership, she looked to other members of the Resistance like Poe Dameron to take on these responsibilities when she was gone.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.''\"<br>\"''He wasn't.

When Luke failed to contact Kenobi while hanging underneath Bespin's Cloud City, weak and helpless, he called out to Leia with the Force, apparently out of instinct.

The exposure and effort left her in vital need of medical attention.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nDespite not completing her Jedi training, Leia was able to preserve her consciousness after death much like her brother, likely being taught by him how to do it.<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n====Other abilities====\n[[File:Motivate_WotF.png|thumb|left|220px|Organa was a natural leader.]]\nRenowned for her leadership and diplomatic skills, Organa was a capable mediator<ref name=\"SE2\" /> and had training in public speaking.
