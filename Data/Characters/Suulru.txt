A [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|moisture vaporator]] was stolen from him by a salvager named [[Jorran]], who sold it back to Suulru for 500 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Suulru then discovered that Jorran had removed the [[modulator]], though it had actually been taken by another salvager named [[Daraala]]. [[Meetra Surik]] assisted him and later recruited him to join the [[Khoonda Militia|militia]] that defended [[Khoonda]] from [[Azkul]]'s [[Battle of Khoonda|attack]] in [[3951 BBY]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAccording to content retrieved from dialog.tlk, [[Kaevee]] was supposed to be the one who stole Suulru's farming equipment. The Exile could either murder her and retrieve the equipment or take her to the farmer, who would offer her a job. Jorran was subsequently chosen to be the thief.\n\nIn some instances if Vrook Lamar chooses to teach the Jedi Exile a lightsaber form, depending on what class your character and what order you visit Dantooine, he will demonstrate and actually attack Suulru using said form. Though quite obviously a glitch in the game the amusing exchange is considered non-canon\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Suulru\n|ru=\u0421\u0443\u0443\u043b\u0440\u0443\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Khoonda Militiamen]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
