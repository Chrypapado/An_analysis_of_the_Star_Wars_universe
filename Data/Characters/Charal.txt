Before getting off the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] for good, she stole the [[Talisman of the Raven]], a prized artifact that allowed her to [[Metamorphosis (Force power)|metamorphose]] into a [[Bird/Legends|bird]] known as a [[raven]]. The other [[Witch/Legends|witches]] called Charal a traitor and sought to feed her to their [[Rancor/Legends|rancors]], a [[Species/Legends|species]] of ferocious predators. Charal spent [[Standard year/Legends|decades]] trying to escape her pursuers and ultimately joined a band of [[Sanyassan Marauders]], who were themselves being [[Hunting/Legends|hunted]] down by [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|law enforcement agencies]]. Their vessel crashed on the uncharted [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon]] of [[Endor (planet)/Legends|Endor]], where a [[Sanyassan]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] known as [[Terak]] set himself up as [[King/Legends|King]], appointing Charal as his second-in-command.\n\nOver roughly the next [[Standard century/Legends|century]], the long-lived Marauders established themselves as pillagers and raiders on Endor; Charal matched the Sanyassans' natural longevity through her affinity with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Meanwhile, she enhanced her authority over the Marauders thanks to the powers of the Talisman she had stolen from Dathomir before her desertion. Charal hated being stuck on the [[Forest/Legends|Forest]] [[Moon/Legends|Moon]], but she came to regard herself as the [[Witch-Queen]] of Endor. When the [[Towani family]] of [[Human/Legends|Humans]] crash-landed on the moon in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Charal and the Marauders saw the newcomers' still-functional [[Star Cruiser/Legends|Star Cruiser]] as an opportunity to escape.

Their leader, Terak, set himself up as [[King/Legends|King]], occupying [[Terak's Keep|a primitive castle]] in the plains of the [[Dragon's Pelt]] savanna. Using her Talisman to great effect, the Nightsister intimidated the Sanyassan pirates with displays of its power, and she eventually came to rule over them as Terak's cohort.<ref name=\"FF10\">{{FFCite|10|END4, ''The Forest Moon of Endor''}}</ref> There was a delicate balance of power between Terak and Charal, and each of them used every opportunity they could to overcome the other.<ref name=\"WWSWG\">''[[Who's Who in Star Wars Galaxies]]''</ref> Driven by delusions of grandeur, Charal styled herself as the [[Witch-Queen]] of Endor.<ref name=\"gal\" /> Together with the Sanyassans, Charal constantly preyed on the more peaceful inhabitants of the [[Forest/Legends|Forest]] Moon, most notably the diminutive [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]].<ref name=\"Illustrated\" /> She was notably at odds with [[Logray/Legends|Logray]], the Ewok [[Shaman/Legends|shaman]] of [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]], who was admittedly wary of her power.<ref name=\"E:SOE\">''[[Star Wars: Ewoks\u2014Shadows of Endor]]''</ref>\n\nAround [[26 BBY/Legends|26 BBY]],<ref name=\"HNN\">{{Hnn|49|regional/13328_2.html|Missing Starship Search Abandoned|https://web.archive.org/web/20120717023143/http://www.holonetnews.com/49/regional/13328_2.html}}</ref> Charal and the Marauders captured [[Salak Weet]], a stranded [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] [[Scout/Legends|scout]]. Weet spoke of his Star Cruiser hidden in the forests, and he told the Marauders of how the vessel traveled through [[Realspace/Legends|realspace]], capable of doing so by the \"power.\" In much of the [[galactic community]], what the scout spoke of was considered everyday technology, but Charal and the Sanyassans were stuck in primitive thinking. They took Weet's words literally, and Terak became obsessed with finding the \"power\" of the stars that the scout mentioned.<ref name=\"dbmar\">{{DB|species|marauder|Sanyassan Marauders|archivedate=20100210060753}}</ref>\n\nWhile Charal held a position of authority, not all of the Marauders feared the witch. During their life on Endor, Charal and the Sanyassan [[Academician|scholar]] [[Szingo]] developed a bitter rivalry. One [[Standard day/Legends|day]], after Marauder scouts shot down a pirate ship, Szingo asked a passing [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to [[Death/Legends|disintegrate]] the survivors and to bring their leader's weapon to him. Once Charal heard of the discovery, she raided the crashed ship with a few Sanyassan henchmen and destroyed the wreckage to ensure that the scholar would find nothing else. Szingo, intent on revenge, ordered the spacer to kill the Marauders who had performed this act of treachery. When the offworlder did so, Terak was displeased by the deaths of his men, so Szingo intended to place the blame on Charal. However, the Nightsister used her sorcery to prove she had nothing to do with the attack, shielding herself from the King's wrath.<ref name=\"gal\" />\n\n====Charal's poultice====\n{{Quote|I have need of your services once again, my dearest. My poultice that will allow me to divine the future now needs the next ingredient. I will be pleased if you find my slave whom ''[sic]'' hasn't returned with it yet. Will you, my pretty?|Charal|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n[[File:Charal-SWG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nightsister Charal at the beginning of the Galactic Civil War]]\nAt some point between [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]] and [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]],<ref name=\"gal\" /><ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Charal was working on a [[Charal's divinatory poultice|poultice]] that would help her divine the future. A passing-by spacer approached her and offered to be of service. Charal took advantage of the offer and had the spacer venture into the woods to retrieve the [[spleen]] of a healthy Ewok. When the spacer returned with the spleen, Charal added it to her poultice. To retrieve the next ingredient, the Witch-Queen dispatched \"[[Lizardman the Slave|Lizardman]],\" a dimwitted [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] she used as her personal assistant, as he had a keen sense of smell for the type of herb she required. When he did not return, Charal decided to enlist the spacer once again, this time to retrieve Lizardman. The spacer did so, and returned with Lizardman in tow. Fortunately for Charal, the Trandoshan had the herbs required. For her final ingredient, the Witch-Queen required Ewok spittle. The spacer assisted her once again, retrieving a whole, live Ewok and returning it to Terak's Keep.<ref name=\"gal\" />\n\nPleased, Charal extracted the required saliva from the [[Prisoner/Legends|captive]] and completed her poultice. With it, she saw a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] of many ships landing on the Forest Moon, ships she planned to steal. She also discovered that a ship had crashed on Endor recently, and that survivors of the crash possessed a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]]&mdash;a communication device that would allow her to steal the ships that would be landing in the future. Once more enlisting the spacer, whom she now regarded as a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]], Charal bade her servant steal the comlink from the survivors of the crash. The spacer ventured forth, killed the survivors, and returned with the device. The Witch-Queen was overjoyed; with the comlink in her possession, she believed she would be able to control the universe. Satisfied, Charal dismissed her servant; by following the spacer's own destiny, Charal reasoned, the spacer would serve the witch's as well.<ref name=\"gal\" />\n\n====The Witch and the Imperials====\n{{Quote|The Force witch Charal, who called herself a Nightsister, freed us after promise to take her with us when the retrieval ship homed in our beacons.|Pfilbee Jhorn|The Illustrated Star Wars Universe}}\nWhen the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] first explored the Sanctuary Moon, the Marauders captured the Imperial scouting party, including a Human [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] named [[Pfilbee Jhorn]]. Charal relished the hope that she could escape at last with the Imperials. Nevertheless, the Marauders merely took the intruders down into their gritty [[Prison/Legends|cellblocks]], deprived them of their possessions, and [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] one of them to death. Unbeknownst to Terak, the Force witch sneaked into the dungeons to parley with Jhorn and his men. Charal promised to help the survey team escape as long as they vowed to take her with them. The prisoners agreed to the deal, but Terak learned of Charal's treachery before she could escape. He grew angry and had the Sister tossed into a cage even as the Imperials ran to their freedom. The woman stayed in prison until the King finally agreed to forgive her betrayal and let her become his second-in-command again.<ref name=\"Illustrated\" />\n\n====Run-in with Logray====\n{{Quote|You decaying fool! Your pathetic forest magic is no match for the invaders, no match for the Griagh&hellip; And no match for a Nightsister of Dathomir!|Charal to Logray|Star Wars: Ewoks\u2014Shadows of Endor}}\n[[File:Charal_vs_Logray.png|thumb|right|250px|Charal fighting Logray and Paploo for the Sunstar]]\nBy 3 ABY, the Imperials had come back to Endor and started building a [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|deflector shield generator]] and a [[Endor shield generator bunker|bunker]] on the [[Dulok Swamp]]. Their presence on the green moon had awakened the [[Griagh]], a monstrous beast that had long been considered mythical. In the midst of these events, Charal had a showdown with the shaman Logray. He had come along with his apprentice [[Paploo/Legends|Paploo]] to discuss the recent events with her. When the old Ewok allowed her to touch the Sunstar, Charal experienced a powerful vision that gave her a glimpse of the perils to come.<ref name=\"E:SOE\" />\n\nEnticed by the might of the Sunstar, she demanded that Logray let her have it. Faced with the Ewoks' refusal, Charal went on the offensive. Using her [[magic]] to summon a group of [[Dulok/Legends|Dulok]] [[Skeleton/Legends|skeletons]], she prevented Paploo from defending the shaman, whom she ensnared by making giant [[Plant/Legends|brambles]] [[Surge of the Brier|grow and twist]] around him. The witch's plans almost succeeded, until Paploo got rid of the undead Duloks and used his [[Slingshot/Legends|slingshot]] to knock the Sunstar away from her hands. The shot not only hit Charal's hand, but it also struck her talisman, turning the witch into her raven form on the spot. Finding herself in the midst of a temporary defeat, the Witch-Queen of Endor retreated. As an act of revenge, she later had Logray and Paploo ambushed by a group of Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. While still in raven form, the Dathomiri woman scratched one of the stormtroopers' helmets with her claws, causing the trooper to chase her into the woods. This allowed Charal to lead the Imperials directly to the Ewoks.<ref name=\"E:SOE\" />\n\n===The Battle for Endor===\n{{Quote|She's evil!|Cindel Towani, on Charal|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\n[[File:Charal_-_SWGTCG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Charal, the Witch-Queen of the Forest Moon]]\nIn 3.5 ABY,<ref name=\"btm\">''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''</ref> Charal accompanied the Marauders during an [[Raid on Bright Tree Village|attack]] on Bright Tree Village, an Ewok [[City/Legends|settlement]] where the Human [[Towani family]] had sought refuge after crashing on Endor in their [[Towani family star cruiser|Star Cruiser]]. Terak still sought what he called the \"power\"&mdash;actually the [[crystal oscillator]] from the family's spacecraft&mdash;which he believed the Towanis possessed. As such, during the attack, the Witch-Queen ventured to the location of the downed vessel. There, Charal found the family patriarch, [[Jeremitt Towani]], working on the ship; she ordered the Marauders to beat him in an attempt to discover the location of the \"power\". In due course, Terak himself arrived and began interrogating the man. Towani claimed ignorance, but Terak strongly believed that the man was the \"Guardian of the power.\" Terak removed the ship's [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]] oscillator and triumphantly declared to his men that he had the \"power\". At that moment, Towani lunged for a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] and shot down one of the Marauders before attempting to escape. Terak, satisfied with his find, sent his men after the Human.<ref name=\"bfe\" />\n\nUsing her ring, Charal shifted into her raven form and tracked down Jeremitt Towani, who was hiding with his daughter, [[Cindel Towani|Cindel]]. The Witch-Queen alerted the Marauders to their location, but the girl escaped into the woods. As Charal gave chase, the Marauders found and killed the elder Towani. The Human girl was not able to run far, however&mdash;the Witch-Queen returned to her normal form and stopped the young Towani in her tracks. With the rest of her family killed by then, the young girl was taken as a captive by Terak's Marauders. However, she escaped from their custody with the aid of the captured Ewoks while they were on the road to Terak's Keep.<ref name=\"bfe\" /> Back at the [[castle]], Charal attempted to use her Force-witch magic to activate the crystal oscillator, but without success.<ref name=\"FF123\">{{FFCite|123|TOW1-4, ''Cindel Towani''}}</ref> She suggested to Terak that the Towani girl might be able to help activate the device, but her remark only incensed the King. He immediately ordered Charal and the Marauders to locate and recapture the young Human.<ref name=\"bfe\" />\n\nAs a raven, Charal set out into the woods. She was able to ascertain that Towani was staying with another Human living on Endor, an older man named [[Noa Briqualon]]. The day after she had made her discovery, Charal distanced herself from [[Noa Briqualon's hut|Briqualon's residence]] and began calling Cindel Towani's name, replicating the voice of [[Catarine Towani]], the young girl's [[Parent/Legends|mother]]. As the child grew nearer, Charal began singing \"[[My Star]],\" one of the young Towani's favorite songs. To further entice her prey, the Witch-Queen took on the appearance of a much younger Human with [[Gold/Legends|golden]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and white [[Robe/Legends|robes]]. Nearby, she had a white horse waiting. When Towani entered her presence, the disguised witch had the young girl bring a nearby robe to her. Taking the garment, Charal quickly transformed into her normal self and seized Towani. Her new captive in tow, Charal mounted [[Charal's stallion|her horse]], which was now black, and rode for Terak's Keep.<ref name=\"bfe\" />\n\n[[File:Charal1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Charal in 3.5 ABY]]\nThe witch brought Cindel Towani before the Marauder king, and both ordered the girl to release \"the power\" of the crystal oscillator. Towani confessed that she did not know how to use the crystal, sending Terak into a fit of anger. The Sanyassan imprisoned both Charal and the girl in his stronghold's dungeon. Behind the bars, the Nightsister scolded Towani for not giving Terak what he had demanded. The witch also revealed that it was Briqualon's friend Salak Weet&mdash;now lying dead in one of the cells&mdash;who had first told them of \"the power\" contained in the energy cells. Meanwhile, Towani's friends sneaked into the stronghold to free the girl, as well as the Marauders' Ewok captives. Briqualon, [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]], and Briqualon's [[Teek (species)/Legends|Teek]] [[Teek|companion]] made it to the cellblocks and set their friends free. For a moment, Charal hoped she would be able to escape too, and she asked Warrick to open her cage. Towani, however, took the keys from her Ewok companion before he could comply. The party left the castle, taking the crystal oscillator with them.<ref name=\"bfe\" />\n\nWhen Terak learned of the jailbreak, he decided to lead a punitive expedition to retrieve the crystal. He turned to Charal and commanded her to go after the fugitives. He allowed the Force witch to use her Talisman to change into a raven again, but this time, Terak grabbed the bird by the leg and seized the ring. The Sanyassan wanted to keep Charal in bird form so she would track the group without betraying him and running away. The Nightsister flew off with the full Marauder [[Army/Legends|army]] close behind. When they finally reached their targets at [[Noa Briqualon's starship|Briqualon's Star Cruiser]], a [[Battle of Endor (Ewok\u2013Sanyassan conflict)|battle]] ensued between the Marauders and the Ewoks. Charal observed the fighting in bird form, flying around the battlefield. During Terak's final duel with Briqualon, Warrick intervened and used his sling to hit the Sanyassan warlord. However, the Ewok's aim was low: instead of hitting Terak between the [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], the rock struck Charal's ring, which was around his neck. The Talisman of the Raven shattered, unleashing its powers on the Marauder leader and burning him to a crisp,<ref name=\"bfe\" /> as well as trapping Charal in her animal form forever.<ref name=\"EGC\">''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> She swooped down to the ground to try to reclaim the remains of her ring,<ref name=\"FF123\" /> circled frantically overhead and then flew away into the forest, shrieking.<ref name=\"bfe\" /> What became of her subsequently remained a mystery.<ref name=\"FF123\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|The final decision is up to the Emperor, of course, but I hope he chooses never to return to this unpleasant Forest Moon.|Pfilbee Jhorn|The Illustrated Star Wars Universe}}\n[[File:Ravencharal.png|thumb|left|175px|Charal in raven form]]\nAgainst the advice of Sergeant Jhorn, who had been tortured by the Marauders,<ref name=\"Illustrated\" /> [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] chose to build the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator/Legends|shield generator]] for his [[Death Star II/Legends|second Death Star]] [[battlestation]] on Endor's forest moon, and the [[Satellite/Legends|satellite]] found itself in the Empire's grasp.<ref name=\"Death Star II in the Databank\">{{DB|location|deathstarii|Death Star II|archivedate=20100318035521}}</ref> A few [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after the defeat of Charal and the Sanyassans, members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] sought to destroy the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], so they came to Endor in order to disable the [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generator]].
