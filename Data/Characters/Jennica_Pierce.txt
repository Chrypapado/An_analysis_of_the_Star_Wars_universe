After the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], Pierce recruited [[Saponza]]'s [[Tatooine rebel cell|gang]] of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to the Rebel cause, sending them on various missions against Imperial forces.<ref name=\"Starwars.com\">In [[Kekit]]'s [[Databank (website)|Databank]] entry, it is stated that Saponza and his [[Saponza's partner|partner]] played an integral part in the campaign that liberated a [[Jawa]] clan from the [[Tusken Raider]]s. It also states that the plan was orchestrated by Jennica Pierce of the Rebel Alliance. This scenario does not occur if the player aligns with the Empire, so it can be deduced that Saponza's gang joined the Rebellion.</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJennica Pierce is the character that assigns missions in ''[[Star Wars: Commander]]'' if the player has chosen to align themselves with the Rebel Alliance.
