A stray [[blaster]] bolt that was directed at Io [[Death|fatally]] hit the Zeltron in the chest, and he collapsed into nearby crates. The stormtroopers ignored the Zeltron's fall and continued chasing Io down the street.<ref name=\"GE3\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThe Zeltron had pink skin, black [[hair]], and blue [[eye]]s.
