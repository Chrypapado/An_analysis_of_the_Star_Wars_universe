The [[Human/Legends|Human]] residents of the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] were [[Speciesism|speciest]], and it was illegal for non-Humans to live in the [[Upper City]]. Despite this, Larrim, along with several other illegal [[Alien/Legends|aliens]], lived in the Upper [[City/Legends|City]]{{'s}} [[South Apartments]], as they were the only ones who would rent in such a run down location. The authorities found it to be too much trouble, and did not persecute the aliens living there.

Attempting to trap her on the planet, the Sith declared martial law and placed Taris under quarantine. The new rulers vowed to uphold the Tarisians' traditions, but ended up relaxing the laws regarding aliens. Several days after the battle, former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] Revan, with the personality of a [[Republic soldier]], and soldier [[Carth Onasi]] were taking refuge in the South Apartments.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nLarrim, at his kiosk, approached the pair when they walked by. He introduced himself to Revan, who reciprocated the gesture. Revan asked about his kiosk and the illegal aliens. Larrim gladly assisted Revan with these matters, and was willing to barter with him. He was, however, reluctant to answer too many questions unrelated to business for fear of losing the trust of potential buyers.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|Questions?
