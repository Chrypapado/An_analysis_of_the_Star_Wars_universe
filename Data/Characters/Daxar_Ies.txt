He embezzled two billion [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from Palpatine's personal funds, and stashed it into several accounts across the [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].\n\nPalpatine sent one of his [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Hands]], [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], to eliminate him. Daxar made the mistake of making a withdrawal from one of these accounts, and Jade was able to locate him with this transaction.\n\nJade killed him in a shabby twilight level apartment on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Daxar's wife [[Beda Ies|Beda]] and daughter [[Eremay Ies|Eremay]] arrived at the apartment to find Daxar [[Death/Legends|dead]] and Jade still there. Jade told them to flee and never return. Mara never recovered the list of accounts where the billion credits were stashed and she left witnesses leading her to believe that she had botched the job Palpatine had sent her to do.\n\nAccording to [[Raynar Thul|UnuThul]], Beda and Eremay fled to the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] and became [[Joiner]]s with the [[Killik/Legends|Killiks]], and that their hatred towards Jade was what created the [[Gorog|Dark Nest]]. UnuThul's account was, however, untrue.\n\nIn an attempt to drive the Skywalkers apart, [[Alema Rar]] told [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] that Ies had developed the [[Intellex IV droid brain]], a complex device which held an [[R2-series astromech droid|R2-series]] memory bank. At the time Luke was attempting to discover what memories of the beginning of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]] his droid [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] could reveal. It was Rar's hope that Luke would assume his wife had killed his mother, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Daxar Ies\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ies, Daxar}}\n[[Category:Accountants]]\n[[Category:Agents of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
