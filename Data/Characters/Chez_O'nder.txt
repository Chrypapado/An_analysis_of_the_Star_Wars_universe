Chez, the bartender.|A spacer in Saludi's|Coruscani Dawn}}\n'''Chez O'nder''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who worked as a [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] [[Saludi's]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during the last [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Around [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], O'nder encountered a group of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]-allied [[Heroes of Cularin|agents]] who had ventured to Saludi's while tracking [[Believers|some]] [[Sith cult|Sith cultists]]. O'nder disclosed to the agents the existence of a secret back room in Saludi's that led to the cultists' [[Coruscant Believers base|secret hideout]].\n\n==Biography==\nChez O'nder was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during the last [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], where he made a living as a [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] and part-owner of the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] [[Saludi's]], situated in Coruscant's [[Coruscant underworld|undercity]]. At some stage during his life, as a forfeit for losing a [[Gambling/Legends|bar bet]] O'nder was forced to attempt to eat the [[Fuel cell/Legends|fuel cell]] of [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. He almost [[Death/Legends|died]] from the resulting injuries and as a lasting consequence his [[Mouth/Legends|lips]] were fused together.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\nIn around [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is placed in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. Therefore, the events of ''[[Coruscani Dawn]]'' can be dated to circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]].</ref> O'nder hired out a concealed back room of Saludi's to a group of [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Gambler/Legends|gamblers]]. The room contained an entrance to a [[Coruscant Believers base|secret hideout]] occupied by the [[Believers]],<ref name=\"CD\" /> a group of [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]-worshipping [[Sith cult|cultists]]<ref name=\"BOTB\">''[[Belly of the Beaast]]''</ref> from the [[Cularin system]]. Unknown to O'nder, the Twi'leks made a profit from renting the room from him by accepting bribes from the Believers every time one of the [[Sith Cultist|cultists]] passed by to enter their hideout.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\n{{RPG|Coruscani Dawn}}\nA [[Heroes of Cularin|team of freelance agents]] hired by the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], an [[Jedi Order/Legends|order]] of [[The Force/Legends|Force]] users [[Jedi Temple|based]] on Coruscant, ventured to Saludi's in pursuit of the Believers. The agents sought out O'nder, looking for information on the location of the Believers' hideout, but the bartender was unavailable as he was busy preparing drinks. The agents caught up with O'nder when he became free; though he was reticent to disclose anything, after the operatives offered a bribe he provided them with details of how to access the cantina's back room. Shortly thereafter, the agents located the Believers base and confronted the cultists.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nO'nder had only one [[Eye/Legends|eye]]. As a result of his ignoble encounter with a blaster [[Fuel/Legends|fuel]] cell, the bartender's lips were fused together at their center and his mouth only opened on either side. Though his conjoined lips impaired his speech, O'nder refused to get them separated because the injury served as a reminder to him not to anything so stupid again. He enjoyed claiming to patrons of Saludi's that the injury was caused by an attempt to pick his [[Tooth/Legends|teeth]] with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]],<ref name=\"CD\" /> a type of weapon commonly wielded by Jedi.<ref name=\"CSWE - Lightsaber\">{{CSWECite|II|254|Lightsaber}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nChez O'nder appeared in ''[[Coruscani Dawn]]'', a [[2002]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] adventure by [[Morrie Mullins]] that formed part of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\nIn ''Coruscani Dawn'', the players roleplay as the Jedi-allied agents that come to Saludi's while searching for the nearby Believers base. It is possible for the player characters to interact with O'nder during their inquiries, either of their own volition or after being advised by a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] patron of the cantina that O'nder was a good person to speak to for information about what went on in Saludi's. The bartender only discloses to the player characters the existence of the cantina's secret back room after significant effort to convince him, including the offer of a bribe. The number of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] required to persuade him to speak is left to the judgement of the gamemaster and depends on how how successful the players' efforts to coerce O'nder have been.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Coruscani Dawn]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:O'nder, Chez}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
