In his younger days, he was a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]]. When he earned enough money, he bought small bar in the [[Corellian Sector (Nar Shaddaa)/Legends|Corellian Sector]]&mdash;the [[Blue Light]].\n\nAs an old man, Flenn was considered experienced, but rather strange. He was a good bartender and a neverending source of somewhat incredible, but possibly true stories. For example, he spoke of intelligent beings with supernatural powers, which could be a reference to [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] or [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] and sometimes told stories to [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] about [[Ood Bnar]] and the [[Iron Knight]]s. He was often advised to contact entertainment media producers and tell them his stories, which could be the basis for outstanding [[Holodrama/Legends|holofilms]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mich Flenn\n|pl=Mich Flenn\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flenn, Mich}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
