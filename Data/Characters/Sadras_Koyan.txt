He was a wide-shouldered man with thinning hair, and a member of the [[Centerpoint Party|Centerpoint political party]].<ref name=\"fury\" /> During a meeting with [[Dur Gejjen]], [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and other members of [[Five Worlds]], he announced that he had approved the assassination attempt on [[Queen Mother]] [[Tenel Ka Djo]]'s life.<ref name=\"exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\nHe was later elected [[Five World Prime Minister]] by a majority of the other Heads of State and signaled that he wanted to defect to the Alliance. The defect attempt was a trap as Centerpoint fired on both fleets destroying all but the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']] and a few starfighters. After showing that Centerpoint was operational, he demanded from [[General/Legends|General]] [[Turr Phennir]] that the Corellian system be given the supplies they needed which was denied. During the [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Centerpoint Station]], Koyan was informed by his [[Minister of Information (Five Worlds)|Minister of Information]] [[Denjax Teppler]] that [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] attackers were personally heading for him and that he had a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] ready waiting for him at [[Airlock/Legends|airlock]] [[Epsilon 34G]]. Koyan tried to make a hasty retreat from Centerpoint to avoid capture, but instead of a shuttle waiting for him, he found a [[Chinnith|different one]] from the Galactic Alliance and was shot in the chest by its [[Chev]] pilot, instantly killing him.<ref name=\"fury\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''\n*[[Legacy of the Force: Fury (audiobook)|''Legacy of the Force: Fury'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Five World Prime Minister]]<ref name=\"fury\" />\n|years=[[40 ABY]]<ref name=\"fury\" />\n|before=[[Triumvirate (Corellian)|Triumvirate]]<ref name=\"fury\" />\n|after=TBA\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sadras Koyan\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Koyan, Sadras}}\n[[Category:Confederation officials]]\n[[Category:Corellian nationals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]\n[[Category:Tralusians]]"}}}]}}}}
