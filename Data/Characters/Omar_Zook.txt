He was aboard the [[Imperial prison barge]] [[Purge (prison barge)|''Purge'']] when its passengers contracted a [[plague]]. Omar wrote a letter to Kai after almost everyone onboard had died from the disease and he had been infected as well. He expressed his condolences for not being there for the boys and told her that he loved all of them. The letter was recovered aboard ''Purge'' after its occupants were decimated by the plague and it was released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the history of ''Purge''. [[Zahara Cody]] and [[Trig Longo]] delivered his letter to his wife after they had escaped from ''Purge'', then from ''Vector''.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Death Troopers]]'' {{C|Body}}\n*[[Death Troopers (audiobook)|''Death Troopers'' audiobook]] {{C|Body}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Death Troopers: Recovered Messages from Purge]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zook, Omar}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Corrections Service personnel]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
