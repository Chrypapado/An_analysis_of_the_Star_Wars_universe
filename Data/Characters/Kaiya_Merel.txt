She was a member of the [[Meatlumps|Meatlump gang]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|This sounds promising. If that Meatlump lieutenant, Kaiya Merel, will recruit you as a replacement for the old Meatlump, then this could be an even better way in than I ever expected.|[[Vani Korr]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Kaiya Merel was a lieutenant of the Meatlumps, a gang of technology-hating thugs and criminals, who lived in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]]. Meatlumps under her orders included the old and disillusioned [[Alliin Mepou]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP5\" />\n\nAround [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> [[Vani Korr]], a ''[[Corellia Times]]'' [[Journalist/Legends|reporter]], was investigating the Meatlumps in order to find the fabled [[Meatlump Hideout]]. She dispatched a spacer to meet Alliin Mepou. The old Meatlump wanted to leave the organization but he could not retire from being a Meatlump unless a new person take his place. The spacer, who wanted to infiltrate the Meatlumps for Vani Korr, eagerly accepted to replace Mepou.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP5\" />\n\nThe spacer encountered Kaiya Merel in Coronet and managed to convince her to be admitted among the Meatlumps. Merel proposed several jobs to test her new recruit. The woman wanted to start a collaboration with two other criminals, the [[Rogue CorSec|Rogue]] [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] [[Officer/Legends|officers]] [[Erinn Bonette]] and [[Echdo Bervekk]]. She ordered her new recruit to help the Rogue CorSec hijack a [[shuttle/Legends|shuttle]]. However, the spacer instead killed them, and lured Kaiya Merel by claiming that their meeting was raided by CorSec agents.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP6\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 6|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nKaiya Merel then learnt that another Meatlump lieutenant, [[Stephax Dain]], was planning a big operation but she was not keen on letting her rival get any credit for this action. She tasked her new recruit to search Stephax Dain's camp near [[Kor Vella/Legends|Kor Vella]]. The spacer found a well-worn notebook that contained detailed information about Stephax's plans: attack a [[Weapons Research Facility (Rori)|Weapons Research Facility]] located on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Rori/Legends|Rori]]. Kaiya Merel therefore ordered the spacer to disrupt the facility operations before her rival. However, Stephax and his Meatlump pronks had already taken over the facility when the spacer arrived on Rori. The adventurer thus attacked the Meatlumps, killing Stephax Dain and a number of pronks. When the spacer returned to Corellia, Kaiya Merel was extremely satisfied of the death of her rival. She finally accepted the spacer among the Meatlumps for good and gave access to the Meatlump Hideout, located in the [[Coronet Maintenance Tunnels]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP7\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 7|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer eventually met the legendary [[Meatlump King]] in the hideout, allowing Vani Korr to write the article ''[[Who are the Meatlumps?]]''.<ref name=\"SWG:MtM\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|Meet the Meatlumps|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKaiya Merel appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP5\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Kaiya Merel was added to the game with the update dubbed \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 10|Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King]]\", released on [[June 19]], [[2008]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67812&month=062008|text=Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King|archivedate=20110924005831}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Meatlumps Hideout}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Merel, Kaiya}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Meatlumps]]"}}}]}}}}
