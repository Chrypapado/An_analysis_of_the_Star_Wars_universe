When the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Riboga]] seized control of the crime in the [[Cularin system]] from the [[Oblee]] [[Nirama]], Carlin and the Gundarks refused to submit to the Hutt's authority. However, Carlin soon began to realize that the Gundarks might not have made a wise decision, and he expected that the Gundarks would come under attack from Riboga's minions. The [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents who were trying to work against Riboga, met with Carlin in the ''[[Chancellor's Head]]'' pub on Genarius and offered to assist him in resisting Riboga.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Preemptive Strike]]''\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
