Properly known as '''Quetemoor the Sub-Elder''', he shared power with his older sister [[Quetemoor the Elder]], his father [[Quetemoor the Venerable]], and his nephew [[Quetemoor the Younger]], as well as family members from other lineages.\n\nThough he worked out a peace with [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor's]] overarching [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] syndicate, Quetemoor constantly battled his smaller rivals for a bigger piece of the underworld action, reserving a special hatred for the crime lord [[Beuga Odell]].\n\nThough Quetemoor could be brutally sadistic to his enemies, he had a robust sense of humor and a booming laugh. Freelance employees who amused Quetemoor would be placed on his list of \"grimacers\" and receive plum assignments from his [[Majordomo/Legends|majordomo]]. He owned a customized bulk [[Transport/Legends|transport]], the ''[[Cold Front]]''.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nQuetemoor is described in the text as being a \"Human\", yet his stats call him a \"Mugaari\", along with \"new species\" stats being presented for the Mugaari. It is also made clear that the Mugaari resent Humans. A possible fix is that Mugaari are near-humans, and their resentment is towards baseline humans.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n[[Category:Black Sun members]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
