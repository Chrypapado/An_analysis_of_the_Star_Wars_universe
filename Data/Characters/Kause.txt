He served as a [[council]]or on the [[Kolatill Council]], until the entire governing body was arrested and [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] by the newly appointed [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Governor/Legends|Governor]], [[Tetrum]], in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]]. Kause remained in prison until [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], when the planetary population rose up and overthrew Tetrum following the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] successful [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberation]] of the [[Sector/Legends|sector]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]], [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]]. Upon his release, he&mdash;along with the other two surviving Council members&mdash;was asked to reconstitute the Council and lead Kolatill, to which he and the others agreed. Shortly after assuming power, the capital [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Domaz]] was [[Bombing of Domaz|attacked]] by [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]] deployed from the Imperial [[Ton-Falk-class escort carrier|''Ton-Falk''-class escort carrier]] ''[[Kathol Protector]]'' in retaliation for their act of defiance. With the city in ruins, the Council [[Distress signal/Legends|requested aid]] from the New Republic. The [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[FarStar]]'' was the first [[Starship/Legends|ship]] to attend the planet, and Kause served as the primary contact for the vessel's representatives when they were on the surface. He insisted on meeting with the ''FarStar''{{'s}} [[Commander/Legends|commander]], [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Keleman Ciro]], on the surface of the planet to show solidarity to the population of Kolatill. While on route to meeting with Kause, Ciro was captured by the Empire when the ''Kathol Protector'' returned to [[Battle of Kolatill|strike]] at the planet a second time. Following the successful defense of the planet, Kause attended a memorial ceremony to honor the fallen.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] named Kause lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kolatill]] in the [[Kathol sector]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] and served as a [[council]]or on the [[Kolatill Council]]. The [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Sector/Legends|sector]] [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], [[Kentor Sarne]], recognized that Kolatill's extensive [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] manufacturing industry would be useful to his military build-up, and so he appointed an Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]], [[Tetrum]], to rule the planet in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]]. Tetrum declared martial law on Kolatill and ordered all repulsorlift manufacturers&mdash;with the exception of the wealthy and [[Politics/Legends|politically]] connected [[Ikas-Adno/Legends|Ikas-Adno]] corporation&mdash;to produce combat [[Speeder/Legends|speeders]] for Sarne's [[Moff Sarne's forces|military]]. He also ordered the arrest of the entire Council, and Kause was [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]].<ref name=\"O\" />\n\nKause remained in jail for eight [[Standard year/Legends|years]], until he was freed when the population of Kolatill rose up and overthrew Tetrum. He discovered that he was only one of three members of the Council still alive, and that the populace had rebelled because the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] had successfully [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberated]] the sector [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]].<ref name=\"O\" /> That victory had sent Moff Sarne fleeing into the Kathol sector with his forces.<ref name=\"TSB\">{{DarkStryder|The Saga Begins|The DarkStryder Campaign}}</ref> The people of Kolatill asked the Council to resume their leadership of the planet, a role that Kause and the other two members accepted. The Council's first act was to declare their allegiance to the New Republic.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\nHowever, that declaration, combined with the imprisonment of Tetrum, prompted a response from Imperial forces still operating in the sector. The Imperial [[Ton-Falk-class escort carrier|''Ton-Falk''-class escort carrier]] ''[[Kathol Protector]]'' soon arrived in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] and deployed [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]]. The [[Bomber/Legends|bombers]] [[Bombing of Domaz|targeted]] the capital [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Domaz]], causing massive destruction and leaving the city in fiery ruin. Kause and the Council immediately sent out a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress call]], imploring the New Republic forces at Kal'Shebbol for help.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\nFour [[Standard day/Legends|days]] later, the New Republic [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[FarStar]]'' arrived in orbit of the planet and began deploying [[Medic/Legends|medical]] and relief teams to Domaz. Kause was the primary contact for the New Republic representatives, relaying information to them regarding the attack and accompanying them as they surveyed the city. Kause wished to meet with [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Keleman Ciro]], commanding officer of the ''FarStar'', and while the Council was willing to meet with him on the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]], they insisted on a meeting on the planet's surface to display \"appropriate symbolism.\" Kause and the Council also intended for the meeting to be broadcast to Kolatill's other cities to boost morale among the population.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\nWhile in transit to the surface to meet with Kause and the rest of the Council, Ciro's [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomatic]] [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] was captured by Imperial forces when the ''Kathol Protector'' returned to Kolatill to [[Battle of Kolatill|strike]] at the planet a second [[Time/Legends|time]]. The combined forces of the ''FarStar'' and the fledgling [[Kolatill Defense Force]] managed to repel the attack, successfully stopping TIE bombers from targeting Kolatill's other cities with [[pathogenic bomb]]s. Later, at a memorial ceremony to honor those who had perished in the battle, Kause and the Council presented the ''FarStar''{{'s}} new commander, [[Kaiya Adrimetrum]], with coordinates to the planet [[Gandle Ott]], since they believed that Sarne was heading in that general direction.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKause believed in the tenets of the New Republic and wholeheartedly declared his&mdash;and Kolatill's&mdash;allegiance to the galactic government as soon as he was able to. However, he did expect a great deal of help and support from the New Republic to aid his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. Kause also believed that governments should present a united and stable front, as evidenced by his insistence that Keleman Ciro meet with the Council on the planet to show that they were in control of the situation, and that they had the support of the New Republic. He also intended for the Council meetings with Ciro to be broadcast across the planet to boost morale among the population.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKause's only appearance in ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]] is in the [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] adventure ''[[Omens]]'', which was written by [[Bill Smith]] and included as one of the scenarios in ''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]''. Kause is used as the \"face\" of the Kolatill Council and as a conduit to relay appropriate information to the players.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign}} {{1st}}\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign, Deluxe}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Kolatill residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
