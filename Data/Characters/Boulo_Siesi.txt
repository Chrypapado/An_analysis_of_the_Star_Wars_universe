Cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Siesi resided in the [[City/Legends|town]] of [[Wayfar]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] where she created three works of art, titled ''[[Golden Petals 1]]'', [[Golden Petals 2|''2'']], and [[Golden Petals 3|''3'']]. All of these [[Painting/Legends|paintings]] were subsequently featured in the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]] by curator [[Lilas Dinhint]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Open your eyes!

While there, she created three [[Painting/Legends|paintings]], titled ''[[Golden Petals 1]]'', ''[[Golden Petals 2]]'', and ''[[Golden Petals 3]]''. Each painting featured a slightly different abstract rendition of [[Flower/Legends|flower]] petals.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], curator [[Lilas Dinhint]] oversaw the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> which served as the planet's only [[Museum/Legends|museum]].<ref name=\"Eisley\">''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''</ref> Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Boulo Siesi was one of the artists to be considered, along with [[Vanvi Hotne]], [[Giaal Itotr]], [[Kahfr Oladi]], [[Klepa Laeel]], and [[Kolka Zteht/Legends|Kolka Zteht]]. In order to have her paintings featured in Bestine, however, Siesi required enough votes to win over her fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty [[Standard day/Legends|days]], allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the course of her artistry career, Siesi was approached by a number of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], many of whom voted for her as their artist of choice. Siesi won the art competitions at various times, allowing her the opportunity to display her paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time her paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. This allowed the opportunity for [[Architect/Legends|architecturally-inclined]] furniture makers and [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] to mass-produce copies of Siesi's paintings so that they could be purchased, [[Collector/Legends|collected]], or displayed for personal use.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Expand you mind, my friend.
