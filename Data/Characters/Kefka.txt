He was tall, broad, and pale. He looked [[Human/Legends|human]] with a little [[Kiffar/Legends|Kiffar]] spliced in, although this was never specified as such. Kefka was responsible for the manufacture of droids produced by [[Cestus Cybernetics]], including the [[JK-13 security droid]]. In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the Families of Cestus Cybernetics conspired to overthrow the Regent [[G'Mai Duris]] from the government of [[Ord Cestus/Legends|Ord Cestus]], hoping to replace her with a more pliable puppet. The [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and the [[Vippit]] barrister [[Doolb Snoil]] encouraged the Regent to be wary of trusting the Families, but were unable to find a peaceful resolution.\n\nAfter the failure of diplomacy, the [[supercruiser]] [[Nexu (starship)|''Nexu'']] bombed the bunker where Kefka and many members of the Five Families were hiding in the midst of attacks from the revolutionary group [[Desert Wind]]. Many of the heads of the Five Families perished in the destruction, and the remaining members of the Families made an agreement with the Regent and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], with Regent Duris retaking control of Ord Cestus.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Cestus Deception]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kefka\n}}\n\n[[Category:Cestians]]\n[[Category:Confederacy of Independent Systems individuals]]\n[[Category:Humanoids]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
