He was close friends with fellow Jedi Master and Council member [[Kavar]]. He was killed on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] by [[Kreia|Darth Traya]] along with Kavar and [[Vrook Lamar]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Not once did I hear one of the Council claim responsibility for Revan, for Exar Kun, for Ulic, for Malak&hellip; or for you. Yet&hellip; you were the only one who came back from the wars to face our judgment. And rather than attempting to understand why you did what you did, we punished you instead. Our one chance to see where we had gone wrong, and we cast it aside.|Zez-Kai Ell to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nEll was one of the Masters on the High Council during the Mandalorian Wars. He was also one of the Masters that [[Trial of Meetra Surik|banished]] [[Meetra Surik]] from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. His [[Zez-Kai Ell's Padawan|own]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] during the Mandalorian Wars, but Master Ell did not blame his apprentice for choosing to go to war because he understood why his apprentice followed the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] that went to fight. When they banished Surik from the Order, he thought that the Council had thrown away an incredible opportunity: to understand why so many Jedi leave the Order and see if there is anything wrong with their teachings.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nAfter the [[Jedi Civil War]], with the onset of the [[First Jedi Purge]], Ell went into a voluntary exile on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] in an attempt to escape detection by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. While he knew about the bounty [[G0-T0]] put on the remaining Jedi, he did nothing to stop him. But Surik later arrived on Nar Shaddaa to find him and stop G0-T0. When [[Mira]], a bounty hunter Ell hired to protect Surik, was captured, Ell finally came out of hiding and decided to help the Exile stop G0-T0.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nAfter G0-T0's yacht was destroyed, Surik and Ell were finally able to talk. He told her many things, including his own doubt in the Order's teachings, and about his decision to leave the Order. When the subject of [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] came up, he told her that he believed redemption had not actually been Revan's choice, despite the fact that he had learned his identity, and the fact that he had kept to the way of the light side before the destruction of the [[Star Forge]], though it is likely from the context of his statement he may have been referring to the mind-wipe itself.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /> Thus, he was indicating that redemption was not Revan's choice, but rather the choice made by his programmed counterpart.\n[[File:RevanForceDrain.jpg|thumb|left|Zez-Kai Ell killed by [[Kreia|Darth Traya's]] [[Force drain/Legends|Force drain]] along with [[Vrook Lamar]] and [[Kavar]].]]\nHe believed that the Council had committed a crime in inserting a new identity over Revan's dead mind, despite how much they benefited from a Jedi-controlled Revan. He also told Surik that she had done the right thing to take action and fight in the Mandalorian Wars, when so few Jedi had followed her example.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nSoon after Surik sought him out, he gathered with Masters [[Vrook Lamar]] and [[Kavar]] at the rebuilt [[Jedi Enclave]] to answer Surik's questions. Ell was eventually killed when Darth Traya used Force drain on him and the other Masters to strip them of their connection to the Force, after they tried to sever Surik from [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] in order to seal the breach she had created but he and the other Jedi Masters could not survive without it and died.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Zezkaiell_lightsaber.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Zez-Kai Ell with his violet double-bladed lightsaber.]]\n\nZez-Kai Ell was more openly thoughtful and introspective than some of his fellow Jedi Masters, and was quick to state his belief that the Jedi Council's inaction led to Revan's fall - even going as far to say that blame was not solely on the Jedi who left to fight, but on the Council as well. After the [[Jedi Civil War]], he no longer considered himself a Jedi, claiming to have left the Order in disgust with both the Jedi Order and himself.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nIndeed, when the Exile met him, he appeared to have fallen into a depression, displaying something close to a death wish at times during their conversation. Despite this feeling of disillusionment, he still remained loyal to the Order, and continued to trust in Master Kavar's plan to draw out the Sith by finding the Exile.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nZez-Kai Ell was a master of advanced [[Force form]]s and an expert at [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]], practicing [[Form IV/Legends|Ataru]], [[Form V/Legends|Shien]], [[Form VI/Legends|Niman]] and [[Form VII/Legends|Juyo]]. He wielded a violet-colored [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|double-bladed lightsaber]].<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHe was voiced by [[Billy Brown]].\n\nIf the player chooses to follow the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] in [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|''Knights of the Old Republic II'']], the Exile and Ell fight on Nar Shaddaa, a battle during which the Exile kills him and learns his lightsaber combat technique. The Exile can still choose to kill Ell should the player take the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light-side]] path.\n\nIt is possible that Master Ell was not privy to the knowledge that Revan did eventually learn of his true identity but still remained loyal to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]. This could partly be the reason he did not believe Revan's redemption was his own choice. Though it is also possible that he may be referring to the reprogramming that gave Revan his new identity rather than the events surrounding the Star Forge.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' you can craft his double-bladed lightsaber, if you have sufficient skill in Artifice. In this game it is orange rather than purple.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 9|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 9]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Codex}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki}}\n\n{{CouncilMandWar}}\n\n{{CouncilAMandWar}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zez-Kai Ell\n|es=Zez-Kai Ell\n|pl=Zez-Kai Ell\n|pt=Zez-Kai Ell\n|ru=\u0417\u0435\u0437-\u041a\u0430\u0439 \u042d\u043b\u043b\n|fi=Zez-Kai Ell\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ell, Zez-Kai}}\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi High Council members]]\n[[Category:Jedi Masters of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
