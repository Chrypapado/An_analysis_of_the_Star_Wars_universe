Glongfurrp worked as one of the operation's enforcers, while Yerres was a [[Courier/Legends|courier]]. As Yerres moved up through the ranks of Jabba's organization, Glongfurrp became his bodyguard.<ref name=\"GG2-2\">[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]</ref>\n\nOver the [[Standard year/Legends|years]], Glongfurrp had, on several occasions, been approached with offers to betray Yerres. Subtle approaches generally confused the Gamorrean, while direct ones offended and outraged him. His usual response was the [[Death/Legends|killing]] of the messenger, forcing Yerres to handle the situation to keep them both alive.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" /> Glongfurrp commanded a group of six Gamorreans, and they resided in reinforced rooms on the fifth floor of the [[Holiday Towers]]' west building.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\nBy the time of the ordered evacuation of [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Glongfurrp was working for [[K'cri Elban]].<ref name=\"GMLA\">''[[Gamemaster Toolkit: Live-Action Adventures]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGlongfurrp was a Gamorrean who stood 1.87 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] tall, and weighed 115 [[Kilogram/Legends|kilograms]]. Glongfurrp's intelligence was the main reason that Yerres kept him around. On Glongfurrp's end, his intelligence allowed him to appreciate the fact that Yerres trusted him like he trusted no other individual. For Yerres' part, he recognized that Glongfurrp's intelligence level did not allow him the skills to even comprehend betraying his employer.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> He was also aware that Glongfurrp tended to devote himself to the protection of any individual as long as they provided him with work, safety, and entertainment.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" /> Glongfurrp enjoyed his life under Yerres as he was well fed and cared for. The only downside was the lack of fighting, which caused him to seek out danger for the fight.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nGlongfurrp was skilled in the use of [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], as well as [[Unarmed combat|unarmed]]<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> and [[Melee weapon/Legends|melee]] combat.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nGlongfurrp's tusks were metal-tipped, which were a gift from Yerres, and he kept them pristine. However, his clothing was often battle-worn and bloodied.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> He wielded an [[axe]] in battle.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Gamemaster Toolkit: Live-Action Adventures]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
