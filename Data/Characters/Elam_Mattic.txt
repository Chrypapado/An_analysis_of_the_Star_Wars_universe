When Elam planned to move to [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], Louie hoped that his blaster instruction would protect his relative from the [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gang]] violence that plagued the planet.\n\nBy [[3956 BBY]], Elam had migrated to Taris. Erstwhile, their brother left for [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] to become a [[Miner/Legends|miner]], and their pet Hyperdrive followed either one of them. Louie's concern was not misplaced as in that year, Elam's [[Lower City Apartments|apartment]] in the [[Lower City]] was dominated by the presence of [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]], a gang that killed civilians on the streets indiscriminately as part of their [[Bek\u2013Vulkar gang war|war]] against their rivals, the [[Hidden Beks]].\n\nIn light of the severe crime rate, Elam kept their most valuable possessions, including 100 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], a suit of [[Republic mod armor]], and their uncle's blaster pistol secured in a [[Footlocker/Legends|strongbox]]. This safe was locked by a computerized touch panel that employed a password entry system, and it was impossible for Tarisians to slice into due to it being a foreign and by 3956 BBY, outdated, model. In spite of this, Elam added an additional layer of security in the form of a [[Gas mine|minor gas mine]].\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nNevertheless, the strongbox was cracked by the mind-wiped former [[Jedi]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and his companions when they wandered into Elam's apartment during the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire's]] occupation of Taris. Louie had left an electronic message on Elam's personal message center next to the safe, and this message provided all the answers to the box's security questions: the name of Elam's pet (Hyperdrive), the relative that taught Elam to use a blaster (Uncle), and Elam's homeworld (Alderaan). Deactivating the mine, Revan and his friends accessed the crate and retrieved its contents for their own use when Elam was not home.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nElam Mattic only figures as an off-screen non-player character in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. This individual's [[Species/Legends|species]] and [[Gender/Legends|gender]] is never revealed.\n\nElam's role in the game is trivial, being only the owner of a strongbox that can be looted by the player, Revan, and doing so has no effect on the storyline nor does it serve as a quest.\n\nAs is the case with many role-playing video games, robbing Elam's room doesn't affect the player's alignment.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fi=Elam Mattic\n|pl=Elam Mattic\n|ru=\u042d\u043b\u0430\u043c \u041c\u044d\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians|Mattic, Elam]]\n[[Category:Tarisians|Mattic, Elam]]"}}}]}}}}
