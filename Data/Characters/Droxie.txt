A member of the [[Benthar's Boys]] gang, she was involved with the leader, [[Benthar]], until she switched her affections to [[Herafin]], leader of the [[Vibroblade gang]] and joined them. Droxie's decision ignited a feud between the two gangs, which resulted in the Vibroblades capturing Benthar. He was eventually rescued by the Boys with help from operatives from the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], who convinced both gangs to unite and oppose the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] presence on the planet.<ref name=\"Blades\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Star Wars Gamemaster Kit|story='Blades and Blasters}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Classic Campaigns|story='Blades and Blasters}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Draenell's Point residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
