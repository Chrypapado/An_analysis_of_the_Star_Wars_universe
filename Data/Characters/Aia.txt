Aia was tall and lean, with white feather-like hair and webbed hands.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], he met the young orphan known as [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] at a cantina known as [[the Bonny Bounty]]. He asked Boba how he came to be wandering alone in the darkened alleyways of the moon. Boba had traveled alone to Bogg 4 in his late [[Jango Fett/Legends|father's]] ship, [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']]. Upon landing the ship, he accidentally damaged one of the landing struts. An unscrupulous [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]] named Honest [[Gjon]] promised to repair it, but instead hijacked the vessel and departed for nearby [[Bogg 11]]. Aia knew of Honest Gjon's reputation and promised to help Boba recover his ship. He showed him a means by which to travel to Bogg 11 without the aid of a [[Starship/Legends|starship]]. He took him to the peak of a large cliff and showed him how to ride the winds of the gravity waves as the atmosphere of the two moons overlapped one another. They leapt and sailed weightlessly between the two moons.\n\nThey soon found Honest Gjon and Boba recovered ''Slave I''. Gjon felt sorry for the disenfranchised orphan and offered to help him make some fast money. Aia, Boba and Gjon flew to [[Bogg 2]] where they began stealing counterfeit [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from a group of [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]]. The operation went sour, however, and they were barely able to hold on to a 100 [[Galactic Credit Standard|creditnote]]. Aia gave the 100 credits to Boba and advised him to go to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to seek his fortune. As Boba prepared to leave the [[Bogden system]], Aia gave the boy a hug. This allowed him the opportunity to not only say goodbye, but to also steal back the 100 credits he had just given him, as well all the rest of the credits Boba owned at the time.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAia was always cheerful and friendly and maintained a whimsical air about him. He had a penchant for turning simple statements into interrogatives, often ending his sentences with the phrase, \"yes?\"\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHis native species and planet of origin has never been revealed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Boba Fett: The Fight to Survive]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Aia\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bogden residents]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
