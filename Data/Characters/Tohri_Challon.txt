Remember, my liege, that I was always loyal.|Admiral Tohri Challon|Legacy (2006) 46}}\n'''Tohri Challon''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] and one of most loyal followers of [[Roan Fel]] and his [[Empire-in-exile]]. Challon originally served [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] Fel in the capacity of [[Imperial Adjunct]]. However, as the [[Second Imperial Civil War]] progressed, she was elevated to the rank of [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|This is Admiral Tohri Challon, in command of His Imperial Majesty's Star Destroyer Dauntless, to all fighters -- the Sith have obviously learned of our rendezvous with the Jedi.|Admiral Tohri Challon|Legacy (2006) 45}}\n[[File:Challon_dauntless.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Admiral Challon on the bridge of the ''Dauntless'']]\n\nIn [[137 ABY]] Imperial Adjunct Tohri Challon was present at the Imperial headquarters in [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]], the seat of power of the deposed Emperor Roan Fel. She personally welcomed [[Vikar Dorn]], [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] of [[Munto Codru/Legends|Munto Codru]], during the supposed defection of the entire crew of the [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] [[Dauntless (Pellaeon-class)|''Dauntless'']]. The defection, however, was part of a [[One Sith|Sith]] plot orchestrated by [[Darth Maladi]], a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lady]], to have Emperor Fel [[Duel on Bastion|assassinated]] by a Sith Lord named [[Darth Kruhl]].\n\nAs the Second Imperial Civil War progressed, Challon was given the rank of [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] and took command of the ''Dauntless'', now part of the Fel loyalist [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Navy]]. The ''Dauntless'' transported Emperor Fel to the agricultural world of [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]], a planet on the edge of Fel-controlled space, for a meeting with members of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[New Jedi Order|Order]]. [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Basile]] was her second in command.\n\n[[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Morrigan Corde|Nyna Calixte]], Director of [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]], made her way to Agamar and interrupted the meeting to the Emperor that the Sith had [[Operation: Thunderstroke|had sent]] a [[First Sith Imperial Strikeforce|strike force]] to capture him. At the same time, the Sith-loyalist Star Destroyer ''[[War Hammer]]'', under the command of Moff [[Rulf Yage]], emerged from hyperspace and engaged the ''Dauntless''. Challon ordered her entire crew to engage the Sith forces in order to buy time for Emperor Fel to evacuate the planet.\n\n[[File:Dauntless_destroyed.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ''Dauntless'' is destroyed with all hands lost.]]\nIn the course of the battle, the ''Dauntless'' suffered heavy damage and lost its shields. Nonetheless, Admiral Challon ordered her crew to continue attacking the enemy to provide cover for the [[Defender One|Emperor's shuttle]], allowing it to escape to [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]. As the shuttle took the Emperor to safety, Challon paid her respects to her monarch, reminding him that she had always been loyal to him. The ''Dauntless'' was finally overwhelmed by the ''War Hammer'' and was destroyed. Challon and her entire crew perished in the explosion.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThe [[Attack on Emperor Fel|coup]] that deposed Roan Fel and elevated [[Darth Krayt]] to [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] led to a schism within the Imperial hierarchy between those who believed their allegiance had to remain with the throne, regardless of the person seating on it, and those who professed loyalty in the [[Fel dynasty]]; Tohri Challon was part of that second group. Challon remained a loyal follower of her monarch and joined his resistance against the Sith Empire, serving him even at the expense of her own life.\n\nChallon wore her black hair in cornrows and sported a circular tattoo on her forehead.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Tohri_Challon_and_Vikar_Dorn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tohri Challon greets [[Vikar Dorn]] on [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] [[137 ABY]].]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 13|''Legacy'' (2006) 13]] {{1st}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 45|''Legacy'' (2006) 45]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 46|''Legacy'' (2006) 46]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tohri Challon\n|ru=\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0427\u0435\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Challon, Tohri}}\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats of the Fel Empire]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy admirals of the Fel Empire]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Empire-in-exile]]"}}}]}}}}
