But my worries for Dal are genuine and heartfelt. His interests in the distant past, our ancestors and history outside the system, places on Tython like the Old City...I'm afraid his fate leads him away from the Force. Away from Tython.|Master Brock, on her faith in her daughter and her concern for her son.|Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void}}\n\n'''Lanoree Brock's mother''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Je'daii Master]] who served as instructor at [[Bodhi]], the Temple of Arts, for the [[Je'daii Order]] on [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] at the height of the [[Infinite Empire]]'s reign.\n\n==Biography==\nTrained as a member of the Je'daii Order, she met her future [[Lanoree Brock's father|husband]] as [[Je'daii Journeyer|Journeyers]] crossing the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] Tython on their [[Great Journey]]. Both of the young Je'daii were drawn to Bodhi Temple where [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] exposed their natural talents in the arts. A talented [[Musician/Legends|musician]] with a speciality for prose and [[Poet/Legends|poetry]], she was on the track to become a Je'daii of some renown. Years after their Journey ended, she and her husband became the parents of [[Lanoree Brock|Lanoree]] and [[Dalien Brock]]. Living in the Je'daii settlement surrounding the Temple of Arts, Brock taught at Bodhi, and in the evenings would read poetry to her children before they slept. When her children were growing up, she would teach them the basics of [[Mind trick/Legends|touching another's mind]] and the survival skills necessary to live on Tython.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\nDuring the [[Despot War|war]] between Tython and [[Despot Queen]] [[Hadiya]] and her [[Despot Army|army]], Brock served some of his time on the planet [[Nox]] where the fighting was especially vicious. Following the war and the supposed death of her son, Brock comforted her daughter at Dalien's memorial ritual by assuring her that not everyone completed their Journey. Afterwards, she rarely saw her daughter, who had become a [[Je'daii Ranger]] by the time of Dalien's reemergence during the [[Stargazer Uprising]]. Following the [[Stargazer Uprising]], Lanoree returned to Bodhi Temple and to her parents' house for her brother's second Remembrance Ceremony after she had killed him in service to the Order.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBrock was a loving mother who expressed deep concern for her son. When her children were about to leave on their Great Journey, she pulled her daughter aside and asked her to look after Dalien, as she sensed his middling Force ability. Tearing up as she speaks of her fears that Dalien will be drawn away from Tython, she insisted to her daughter that her worry is genuine and that her son's interest in the distant past troubled her.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]'' {{1st|[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=M\u00e8re de Lanoree Brock\n|ru=\u041c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u041b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0411\u0440\u043e\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brock, Lanoree's mother}}\n[[Category:Je'daii Masters]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Force-users]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified mothers]]"}}}]}}}}
