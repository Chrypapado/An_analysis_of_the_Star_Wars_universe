However, whilst the Separatist invasion of [[19 BBY]] was thwarted, the Republic [[clone trooper]]s turned against the [[Jedi]] and their Wookiee allies. Kashyyyk fell to the [[Galactic Empire]] instead, which [[Slavery|enslaved]] its Wookiee population until the world was [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberated]] by the [[New Republic]] in [[5 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:41stelite.png|thumb|left|320px|King Grakchawwaa stands alongside Jedi General Luminara Unduli in the prelude to the Battle of Kachirho.]]\nThe [[Wookiee]] Grakchawwaa was [[King]] of [[Kashyyyk]] in the last [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].
