He was the [[Mos Eisley Police Station|police station's]] [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] mechanic and was sometimes seen in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina's]] of Mos Eisley. When a group of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]] were inquiring about [[Maxine Baytor]], they met with Verral who informed them that she was being held at the local police station on the other side of town and struck a deal with him. In exchange for a [[Natrilux conductor relay]], he would leave the station's underground garage door unlocked for them. This was of interest to him as it was a rare component for his hobby; short-wave transmitters. The group proceeded to get the relay from the [[HoloNet Waystation]] orbiting Tatooine and returned to him. When they gave him the relay he informed them that an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] customs frigate had picked up their visit to the station and was sending a contingent of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] to the city. Because of this, the group quickly planned their attack. Verral informed them that the duty [[Police officer/Legends|officer]] always napped around the time that they were planning but someone would have to distract the desk [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]] for the plan to work. Though the group considered sending Verral to distract the sergeant, they agreed not to do so.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Challenge 74]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kayrell, Verral}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
