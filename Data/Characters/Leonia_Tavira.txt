[[Reproduction/Legends|Born]] into poverty on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Eiattu 6]], Leonia became the mistress of the planet's Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]], Moff [[Tharil Tavira]], at the age of sixteen. After Tavira's [[Tharil Tavira's first wife|wife]] [[Death/Legends|died]] under mysterious circumstances, he [[Marriage/Legends|took]] Leonia as his wife. Shortly before the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Tharil suffered a stroke and was paralyzed. Leonia took over as ''de facto'' governor while her husband recovered and, when he subsequently [[Suicide/Legends|took]] his own life, declared herself Moff of Eiattu. Following the death of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], Tavira entered into a relationship with [[Harrandatha Estillo]], the presumed heir to the throne of Eiattu, through whom she controlled the [[People's Liberation Battalion]] in order to play them off against the aristocratic ruling council, the [[Priamsta]]. In fact, the putative \"[[Prince/Legends|Prince]] Harran\" was [[Harrandatha Estillo (impostor)|an impostor]] and Imperial agent; the true heir was [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo]]. When the princess returned to her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], the impostor's identity was revealed, and Tavira fled the [[Eiattu system|system]].\n\nAlthough Tavira retained some influence on Eiattu through leading Priamsta member [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Arian Laabann]], she lost control of her former forces and allied herself with [[Kavil]] and his [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] organization, [[Kavil's Corsairs]]. Through Laabann, she hatched a plan to capture Princess [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] during a visit to Eiattu. Tavira hoped to use Organa's capture to force the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] to assist her in overthrowing Kavil and establishing herself as a [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]]. However, her agents inadvertently captured Organa's decoy, [[Winter Celchu|Winter]], who later escaped Tavira's custody. Tavira subsequently assisted [[Grand Vizier/Legends|Grand Vizier]] [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage's]] flight from the Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]; unhappy with her payment, however, she unceremoniously abandoned him on [[Ciutric IV]] and sold his location to [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]].\n\nAt some later point, Tavira joined forces with [[High Admiral]] [[Treuten Teradoc]], from whom she acquired her [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Invidious]]''. Centered around this, she formed and led the [[Invids]], a loose coalition of pirate bands, from around [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]]. Operating out of the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Susevfi]], Tavira coerced the native [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Jensaarai/Legends|Jensaarai]] sect into working for her by threatening to destroy their people. The Jensaarai used their [[Precognition/Legends|precognition]] to alert her of any threats and thus enable her to avoid capture, making her raids all the more successful. In [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], the Jensaarai kidnapped [[Mirax Terrik Horn]], the wife of Rogue [[Squadron/Legends|Squadron]] pilot and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Corran Horn]], when she began to investigate the Invids on behalf of the New Republic. This led to Corran Horn initiating a search for his wife, during which he went undercover among the Invid pirates based on [[Courkrus]] and there began a campaign to disrupt Tavira's operations. Eventually, Horn and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] launched a [[Battle of Susevfi|raid]] on [[Leonia Tavira's palace|Tavira's palace]] on Susevfi, where Mirax was being held. As her enemies closed in, Tavira fled to the ''Invidious'' and turned it against her own headquarters. However, Horn used a powerful [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to frighten Tavira into believing that a large New Republic [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] was on its way and she fled to [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Is there any question that she did away with her husband and his first wife?''\"<br />\"''Not in my mind, but there is no evidence to prove she did.|Corran Horn and Airen Cracken|I, Jedi}}\nLeonia was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] into the common population of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Eiattu 6]]<ref name=\"H1\" /> in the [[Ado sector]] of the [[Mid Rim]]<ref name=\"TEAO\">{{SW|url=wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/06/Starwars.com_Atlas_appendix_June_15.pdf|text=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}}</ref> during the early [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"DOB\">''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]'' states that Tavira was still a teenager at the time of the [[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' comic series]] in 4 ABY, placing her birth in the years following the rise of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY.</ref> Her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] had long been ruled by a royal family, but when they failed to prevent the Empire from establishing a [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]] on the planet, the nobles rebelled and overthrew their rulers, leaving the newly appointed Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]], [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Tharil Tavira]], to rule Eiattu 6.<ref name=\"TWP1\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 13|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 13]]</ref> When she was sixteen standard years old, Leonia attracted the attention of Moff Tavira and the two began an affair.

Tavira personally [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]]; when he revealed nothing she had the fake Harrandatha execute him.<ref name=\"TWP2\" /> Around the same [[Time/Legends|time]], an Imperial patrol captured several members of Rogue Squadron and brought them to Tavira.<ref name=\"TWP3\" /> When she learned that the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] had failed to bring back [[Nrin Vakil]], a member of Rogue Squadron who was wounded during his group's capture, she executed their [[Volks|leader]] and dispatched [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] to retrieve Vakil's body while she interrogated her prisoners. Although she considered the prisoners to be of little use, Tavira decided to keep them alive as hostages in case her plans to seize control went awry.<ref name=\"TWP4\" />\n\nFollowing a raid in which Tavira seized 370 [[Kilogram/Legends|kilograms]] of precious metals, 2.5 million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] in Imperial notes, and 1.5 billion credits worth of Imperial bullion, she ordered all wealth stored at the three remaining royal repositories to be moved to [[Imperial Citadel (Eiattu 6)|her citadel]] in the planet's [[Eiattu 6's capital city|capital city]], ostensibly to protect it from the PLB and draw them into a trap.<ref name=\"TWP3\" /> As planned, Harrandatha's forces soon [[Eiattu Campaign|stormed]] the citadel. As the intervention of the remaining members of Rogue Squadron helped the rebels to overcome the Imperial forces defending the citadel, Princess Estillo exposed Harrandatha as an impostor. With her plotting exposed, Tavira attempted to take her stolen riches and flee. However, Nrin Vakil had survived and managed to rescue his imprisoned [[Wingmate/Legends|wingmates]]. Pursued by Rogue Squadron, Tavira fled the [[Eiattu system|system]] in a single [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class shuttle]] with only a fraction of the stolen wealth.<ref name=\"TWP4\" />\n\n===Kavil's Corsairs===\n{{Quote|I would take Kavil's fleet and make myself a warlord.

Kavil was satisfied with working as a [[Privateer/Legends|privateer]] for the Empire, but Tavira planned to take control of his forces and establish herself as a [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]]. Her opportunity came later in 4 ABY, when Count Laabann provided information that New Republic [[New Republic Provisional Council|Councilor]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] was attending a [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomatic]] summit on Eiattu. Tavira hoped that, if she captured Organa, she could ransom her to the New Republic in exchange for their help in overthrowing Kavil. However, Tavira's agents inadvertently kidnapped Organa's decoy, [[Winter Celchu|Winter]], bringing her and Rogue Squadron [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Tycho Celchu]] to Tavira aboard her pirate [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]].<ref name=\"MQ2\" />\n\nBelieving her prisoner to be genuine, Tavira took her and Celchu back to the Corsairs' base on [[Axxila/Legends|Axxila]] while she made contact with New Republic [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]]. News of Tavira's involvement in Organa's apparent kidnapping soon reached both [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]]<ref name=\"MQ2\" /> and Imperial [[Grand Vizier/Legends|Grand Vizier]] [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]].<ref name=\"MQ3\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 31|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 31]]</ref> Isard was impressed with Tavira and dispatched [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Delak Krennel]] to Axxila aboard the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Reckoning (Imperial II-class)|''Reckoning'']] to bring her both Organa and Tavira. Pestage, meanwhile, was secretly on Axxila to negotiate his defection to the New Republic with the real Organa.<ref name=\"MQ2\" /> The Grand Vizier contacted Kavil personally to ask that the prisoners be turned over to him. However, both Winter and Celchu managed to escape from the pirates<ref name=\"MQ3\" /> and make contact with the rest of Rogue Squadron, who had escorted Organa to Axxila. With her prisoners gone and the [[Undercover operation on Axxila|arrival]] of the ''Reckoning'', Tavira contacted Pestage and offered to sell him her services. Pestage agreed and used his influence to ensure that Krennel allowed Tavira's cruiser to safely leave the [[Axxila system|system]]. Once away from Axxila, Tavira set course for one of Pestage's hidden caches to collect her payment.<ref name=\"MQ4\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 30|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 30]]</ref>\n\nPestage's duplicity was later exposed by Isard and he was forced to flee Imperial Center to avoid arrest. Pestage contacted Tavira to request her help in seeing him safely to [[Ciutric IV]]. Tavira took her cruiser to the [[Coruscant system/Legends|Coruscant system]], where Pestage transferred aboard from his [[Sate Pestage's yacht|private yacht]]. To Tavira's annoyance, Pestage turned the [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] over to its [[Unidentified captain (Sate Pestage's private yacht)|captain]] rather than her; as a result, upon reaching Ciutric, Tavira declared her arrangement with Pestage to be at an end. Leaving him to be arrested by the local Imperial authorities, Tavira departed the planet, telling Pestage to contact her when he was willing to pay a fair price for his freedom.<ref name=\"MR1\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 32|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 32]]</ref> She later contacted Isard via [[Holocomm/Legends|holocomm]] and revealed Pestage's location, requesting a fully equipped and staffed [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] and a guarantee of no Imperial interference for the rest of her life in exchange. Isard did not believe Pestage to be worth such a high price, and instead offered 100,000 credits. Despite Tavira's protests, Isard informed her that her payment would be waiting on the planet [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]] in twenty [[Standard day/Legends|days]] time, for one day only, and only if Tavira's information led to Pestage's capture.<ref name=\"MR2\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 33|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 33]]</ref> Ultimately, however, Pestage was killed by Admiral Krennel, who turned his back on Isard and established himself as a warlord in the [[Ciutric Hegemony]].<ref name=\"MR4\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 35|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 35]]</ref>\n\n===The Invids===\n{{Quote|Without Tavira and the ''Invidious'', her fleet would fall apart and mopping them up would be simple.

Tavira's flirtations turned the competitive brothers against each other,<ref name=\"TIW\">{{SW|url=news/the-imperial-warlords-despoilers-of-an-empire-part-2|text=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire, Part 2|int=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire}}</ref> but the relationship proved profitable for Tavira, who acquired the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Invidious]]'' from Treuten around [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]]. She subsequently went into hiding, emerging only for the occasional supply raid. During [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] [[Thrawn campaign|campaign]] against the New Republic in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], Tavira's raids started to become more bold and, by the time Emperor Palpatine returned in a [[Cloning/Legends|cloned body]] to lead a [[Operation Shadow Hand|new offensive]] in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]], Tavira had begun to assemble a loose coalition of pirate bands around the ''Invidious''. The group, which included the [[Khuiumin Survivors]], the [[LazerLords]], [[Riistar's Raiders]], the [[Blackstar Pirates]], [[Shala]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] gang, and the crews of the pirate ships ''[[Red Nova]]'', ''[[Fastblast]]'', and ''[[Booty Full]]'', collectively became knows as the [[Invids]] after Tavira's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]].<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nAdopting the title of Admiral Tavira, Tavira provided planning and coordination for the pirates' raids. In exchange for fifty percent of the profit from raids, Tavira would select suitable targets and times and arrange for one or more of her gangs to take part, rotating them in order to keep each group sharp and to demonstrate that none were indispensible. On the bigger missions, Tavira would personally lead from the ''Invidious'', using its firepower to suppress planetary defenses and defend against New Republic reprisals before departing with her share. Tavira ensured that none of the pirates could betray her by keeping her allies at arms reach, contacting them when she was planning a raid, but giving them no way to make contact with her. None of the pirates knew where Tavira took the ''Invidious'' between raids except for those recruited into its crew based on their performance in missions. Once pirates joined Tavira on the ''Invidious'' they were not allowed to leave. In addition to the pirates, numerous Imperial personnel served aboard the ''Invidious'', including stormtroopers and former members of the [[181st Imperial Fighter Wing/Legends|181st Imperial Fighter Group]] in the [[Destroyer/Legends|Destroyer's]] three [[Clutch (fighter)|Clutch]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] squadrons. Those who served directly under Tavira became known as [[True Invids]] among the other pirates.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nBy [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], the Invids had become a major concern for the New Republic, which assembled a [[Task force/Legends|task force]]&mdash;including Tavira's old adversaries in Rogue Squadron&mdash;to put an end to the pirate attacks. However, Tavira evaded their best attempts to capture her, leading [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] to suspect she had a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] within the New Republic. When she learned that [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Phan Riizolo]] of the ''Booty Full'' was planning to sever ties with the Invids and had [[Slicer/Legends|stolen]] plans from her [[Computer/Legends|computer]] for a [[Battle of Alakatha|raid]] on the [[Luxury liner/Legends|luxury liner]] ''[[Glitterstar]]'' as it left a resort on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Alakatha/Legends|Alakatha]], Tavira decided to turn her pursuers to her advantage, leaking information to the New Republic about the raid. Hoping to catch Tavira, the New Republic set a trap but succeeded only in capturing Riizolo.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nMuch of Tavira's success was due to her use of the [[Jensaarai/Legends|Jensaarai]], an order of [[The Force/Legends|Force]] users from [[Susevfi]], a moon of the planet [[Suarbi 7]] in the [[Quence sector]]. She first encountered the group when the ''Invidious'' jumped to the [[Suarbi system]] to escape a New Republic task force. When the [[Unidentified Imperial governor (Suarbi system)|local Imperial governor]] rebuffed her advances, Tavira had him executed and took control herself. Tavira met with the [[Female Saarai-kaar|Saarai-kaar]], the leader of the Jensaarai, and gained her trust with promises of freedom from the oppression of both the Empire and the New Republic. She later betrayed the Jensaarai's trust and forced them into her service with threats to annihilate Susevfi's population if they failed her. The key to Tavira's ability to evade the New Republic was the Jensaarai's use of [[Precognition/Legends|precognition]] to sense potential threats to her. With her Jensaarai advisors aboard the ''Invidious'', Tavira was alerted in advance to any attempts by the New Republic to ambush her forces and, on a number of occasions, called off raids to avoid a New Republic trap. The Jensaarai also acted as [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]] for Tavira when she chose to go planetside after a raid to personally inspect the work of her pirates. Susevfi served Tavira well as a base of operations and the ring of [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroids]] around Suarbi 7 provided a location to hide the ''Invidious'' between raids.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n===A Jedi enemy===\n{{Quote|This is Admiral Tavira, Tinta Blue.

An [[Mirax Terrik Horn's client|antique collecting client]] of Horn's had lost some valuable items during a recent Invid raid and Horn had agreed to make some inquiries to help retrieve them. Due to her independence from the authorities, Horn could travel without attracting undue attention and offered to share what she found with Cracken. Although the New Republic had been unable to locate Tavira's base, they were aware that many of Tavira's pirate groups operated out of the Hutt homeworld [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] and Horn began her search there. When the Jensaarai sensed her intentions, they kidnapped Horn and took her to Tavira on Susevfi. Tavira saw little reason to keep the prisoner alive, but the [[Saarai-kaar]] disagreed; Horn was the wife of Rogue Squadron pilot and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] trainee [[Corran Horn]], the grandson of the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Nejaa Halcyon]], who had killed the Jensaarai's founder, [[Nikkos Tyris]], when he fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. As the Saarai-kaar expected, Corran Horn soon began searching for his wife. Meanwhile, the capture of a New Republic agent on Nal Hutta demonstrated that the Invids were no longer safe there and the various pirate groups started to relocate to [[Courkrus]] in the [[Khuiumin system]].<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nTwo [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after Mirax Terrik Horn's capture, Tavira [[Attack on Tinta Lines|attacked]] the [[Tinta Lines]] [[Starship/Legends|starships]] ''[[Tinta Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Tinta Palette]]''. Invid pirates had already infiltrated the crews of the target ships and were expecting little resistance. However, Corran Horn, traveling aboard the ''Tinta Palette'', killed two of the pirates before departing with several passengers aboard the [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] ''[[Tinta Blue Seven]]''. Three of the ''Invidious''{{'s}} Clutch starfighters broke off from the main attack to intercept the shuttle as it fled and Tavira personally hailed the shuttle to order its crew to surrender, but the New Republic pilot was able to evade the pirates long enough to jump to [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]. The [[Sensor/Legends|sensor]] data from the stolen shuttle allowed Horn to identify one of Tavira's support ships as the ''[[Backstab]]'', which he was able to trace back to the Khuiumin Survivors, leading him to the Khuiumin [[Star system/Legends|system]]. Once there, he joined the Survivors under the alias [[Jenos Idanian]] in an effort to get close to Tavira and learn where his wife was being held.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nTavira led the Invids on several more raids over the next few months. On one occasion, Tavira assigned Shala the Hutt's gang to retrieve a shipment of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] from the planet [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] while the ''Invidious'' and the Khuiumin Survivors [[Skirmish near Kessel|attacked]] another target. Shortly after arriving, however, Tavira's Jensaarai advisors sensed a threat to Shala's forces. With only minimal opposition at her target, Tavira decided to go to Shala's aid and leave the Survivors to deal with any local resistance. The ''Invidious'' arrived in the [[Kessel system/Legends|Kessel system]] shortly after Shala was engaged by a patrol of three New Republic [[Corvette/Legends|corvettes]]. The Star Destroyer's arrival turned the situation in the Invids' favor and the pirates inflicted massive damage to the corvette ''[[Freedom of Sullust]]'' before the New Republic ships fled the system. The split second rescue of Shala's forces from a chance encounter with the authorities increased Tavira's reputation with both the pirates and the New Republic.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n===Xa Fel and Kerilt===\n{{Quote|Within a week, I think, I will have the Survivors spearhead an action for me.

Taking no chances, Tavira assembled a large task force for the mission, with corvettes, [[Bulk cruiser/Legends|bulk cruisers]] and several Clutch starfighter squadrons accompanying the ''Invidious''. To bolster her starfighter squadrons, Tavira allowed the Khuiumin Survivors' [[Bolt Squadron (Khuiumin Survivors)|Bolt]], [[Hawk Squadron (Khuiumin Survivors)|Hawk]], and [[Rock Squadron]]s to travel aboard the ''Invidious'' and paired each up with her own [[Blade Squadron (True Invids)|Blade]], [[Saber Squadron (Invid)|Saber]], and [[Pike Squadron]]s. Unknown to Tavira, the New Republic was also sending a task force to Xa Fel, consisting of a [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]], a [[Victory II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory II''-class Star Destroyer]], an [[Immobilizer 418 cruiser/Legends|''Interdictor''-class cruiser]] and several support ships, including Rogue Squadron's [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing starfighters]], on a surprise raid aimed at punishing Kuat Drive Yards for their failure to cut pollution from their facility. Since the New Republic forces were not waiting for the Invids, the Jensaarai failed to sense the threat and Tavira had no warning before her ships were pulled out of hyperspace prematurely by the Interdictor's [[Gravity well projector/Legends|gravity well projectors]]. The New Republic forces responded quickly and moved to intercept the pirates. With the Interdictor preventing them from returning to hyperspace, Tavira launched her starfighters to provide cover while the larger ships withdrew to a safe distance. The Survivors avoided the elite Rogue Squadron and utilized their [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannons]] to disable the other New Republic fighters, but [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Lamner]], commander of the ''Invidious''{{'s}} squadrons, chose to engage Rogue Squadron directly, resulting in heavy losses among Tavira's pilots, including Lamner himself. The ''Invidious'' eventually cleared the [[Gravity well/Legends|gravity well]] and Tavira recalled the remaining fighters before jumping out of the system.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nFollowing the battle, Tavira inspected the surviving pilots in the ''Invidious''{{'s}} [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]]. She congratulated Captain [[Tyresi Gurtt]] of Bolt Squadron for disabling the New Republic fighters, a strategy which had forced the New Republic [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ships]] to stop to retrieve their pilots rather than pursue the pirates, and promoted her to colonel to replace Lamner. Gurtt informed Tavira that the strategy had originally been suggested by Rock Squadron pilot Jenos Idanian, who had also been responsible for shooting down a pair of [[Proton torpedo/Legends|torpedoes]] that had been heading for the ''Invidious''. Tavira was impressed by Horn's performance and, unaware of his true identity, appointed him to replace Gurtt as captain of Bolt Squadron. This drew an objection from Bolt Squadron pilot [[Remart Sasyru]], who informed her that the Survivors required pilots to be voted into Bolt Squadron and suggested himself as a candidate to lead it. Tavira responded with a quick lash from her [[Whip (weapon)|quirt]] and suggested that she had a better use in mind for Sasyru. Deciding to humor the pirates, she allowed a quick vote, in which Horn was unanimously selected to lead the Bolts, before departing with Gurrt.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nDuring the Xa Fel engagement, the Jensaarai aboard the ''Invidious'' sensed the presence of another [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force user]]. During the month that followed the battle, Tavira and her advisors visited Courkrus several times to question the pilots involved in an attempt to uncover the identity of a potential Jedi spy. When she and [[Jacob Nive]], leader of the Khuiumin Survivors, questioned Horn, the Jedi redirected her suspicions away from him by suggesting that [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], a former member of Rogue Squadron, may have been present with the squadron at the battle. The pilot's knowledge of Rogue Squadron's history impressed Tavira and the two began to flirt. Although Tavira was attracted to Horn, when he put a stop to her advances, saying he wanted to focus on his flying, she struck him with her quirt for his presumption. The Jensaarai failed to detect any duplicity in Horn and the pilot was allowed to leave. While still on Courkrus, Tavira decided to make Horn jealous by making it known that she planned to take Sasyru as her new lover following the pirates' next mission.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nTavira's next target was [[Kerilt]], the innermost planet of the [[Algaran system]] and home to one of the largest [[Caamasi Remnant]] communities in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. The Invids arrived in the system to find the [[Thalassian slavers/Legends|Thalassian slaver]] [[Kaloth-style battlecruiser|''Kaloth''-style battlecruiser]] ''[[Harmzuay]]'' in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] of the planet on a [[Battle of Algara|raid]] for [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] from the colony below. Unwilling to let the slavers steal her prize, Tavira opened fire on the slaver vessel. The Thalassians soon realized that they were no match for the ''Invidious'' and attempted to run, but Tavira showed no mercy and destroyed the ''Harmzuay'' in short order. As the Invid fighters entered the planet's [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]], Horn reported to Tavira that the planet's warehouses were full and the natives appeared to have fled. Tavira was happy to leave the Caamasi alone provided they did not interfere and dispatched [[Assault shuttle/Legends|assault shuttles]] to start loading the cargo.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nWhile on Kerilt, some of Bolt Squadron, including Sasyru, attempted to steal from a group of Caamasi. They were interrupted by Horn, resulting in a fight in which Horn badly beat Sasyru and, inadvertently, acquired the services of the Caamasi [[Elegos A'Kla]] as his servant. Following the fight, Tavira's security officers separated the participants and brought them aboard the ''Invidious'' for interrogation. When her interrogators had spoken to both sides, Tavira had Sasyru executed for disobeying orders and striking a superior officer then went to see Horn. Tavira had expected Horn to kill Sasyru to eliminate a rival for her affections. However, she now believed that he had goaded Sasyru into a fight, knowing that she would be forced to kill him, in order to punish her for choosing Sasyru over Horn. Although Horn denied this, Tavira was convinced and offered him the chance to become her new consort, giving him a month to decide and to come to her willingly.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n===Downfall===\n{{Dialogue|Corran Horn|New Republic will be here in no time.

Disguising himself in [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]], he began a successful campaign of terror aimed at driving Tavira's pirates away from Courkrus. Tavira's insistence on one-way communication with the pirates left her blind to events on Courkrus for extended periods. By the time she next sent a ship to the planet, three [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] after the raid on Kerilt, Shala the Hutt was dead, the ''Fastblast'' had fled and desertions had left the Blackstar Pirates, LazerLords, and the crew of the ''Red Nova'' significantly undermanned. The presence of a Jedi on Courkrus convinced Tavira that the New Republic was making a major push to stop her. Within a day of the messenger's return to the ''Invidious'', she traveled to Courkrus to assess the situation. After locating Horn, she gave him one week to take charge of the situation and rally the pirates against the Jedi. She also instructed him to kill Jacob Nive, whose confidence had been shaken by the Jedi's attacks, and to take personal command of the Survivors.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nTavira returned to her headquarters in the former governor's [[Leonia Tavira's palace|palace]] on Susevfi, leaving a group of Jensaarai on Courkrus to hunt for the Jedi. After she departed, Horn managed to [[Duel on Courkrus|capture]] one of the Jensaarai, who revealed that Horn's wife was being held in Tavira's palace. Enlisting the help of A'Kla, Luke Skywalker, and Rogue Squadron pilot [[Ooryl Qrygg]], Horn [[Battle of Susevfi|infiltrated]] the palace and rescued Mirax. Upon learning of the intruders, Tavira used a near-life-size [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] to confront them as they made their escape. The admiral was furious to realize that Idanian was really Horn and that he had been responsible for the events on Courkrus, but Horn threatened that they would be coming for her next. Having lost control of the situation on the moon, Tavira fled in a shuttle before her enemies could reach her and returned to the ''Invidious'', intending to use it to destroy the palace in order to prevent Horn's escape. However, the Star Destroyer was intercepted by Rogue Squadron, the Khuiumin Survivors&mdash;who had agreed to help Horn in exchange for a fresh start in the New Republic&mdash;and Mirax's father, [[Booster Terrik]], aboard the ''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer ''[[Errant Venture]]''. As the two sides fought in orbit, Horn used a powerful [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to frighten Tavira into believing that a large New Republic [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]], including the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]'' and the recently destroyed [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]], the [[Sun Crusher]], was arriving in the vicinity. Believing that the Jedi had lured her into a trap, Tavira fled into hyperspace. Although Tavira escaped, the Jensaarai were freed from her service, leaving her without her ability to evade the New Republic.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|So, this is what I tell you, Jenos Idanian.

Through me, your goals will be accomplished.|Leonia Tavira|I, Jedi}}\n[[File:TaviraDesk-MQ2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Leonia Tavira]]\nAs a young woman, Leonia Tavira was slender with short, [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] with silver highlights&mdash;cut raggedly during her early pirate career&mdash;and piercing, violet [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. By the time she was leading the Invids, Tavira wore her hair longer and had a more rounded, though still petite figure. Her small stature and taut, pale flesh gave her a youthful appearance, but she moved with a confidence that made her appear older. Tavira was well aware that she was considered attractive and frequently used her looks to manipulate men to gain power and wealth. She was just sixteen years old when she began an affair with Moff Tharil Tavira,<ref name=\"IJ\" /> and was content with the subsequent loveless marriage that brought her an opulent lifestyle and an escape from the poverty of her youth. She later manipulated the false Prince Harrandatha Estillo, promising her love to him while using his People's Liberation Battalion to attack the Priamsta and allow her to steal much of Eiattu's wealth.<ref name=\"H1\" /> Tavira was long suspected to have been responsible for the death of her husband&mdash;as well as his first wife<ref name=\"IJ\" />&mdash;and contemplated marrying Estillo and killing him in order to rule as his widow.<ref name=\"TWP4\" /> After fleeing to Susevfi, Tavira attempted to seduce the local Moff and killed him when he rejected her.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nTavira's appetite for male company was well known among the Invids and becoming her consort was one of the few ways to become part of the ''Invidious''{{'s}} crew. When Corran Horn infiltrated the Invids, Tavira found herself attracted to him. However, she instead named Remart Sasyru as her next consort, expecting Horn to find some way to prove his worth to her. After Horn fought Sasyru on Kerilt, Tavira executed Sasyru for insubordination and believed that Horn had turned her manipulation around, forcing her to eliminate his rival for him. Tavira contemplated threatening the Khuiumin Survivors to compel Horn to join her, but instead promised to help him avenge a fictional former lover if he would give himself freely to her.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\nTavira was an intelligent woman, who was also ambitious,<ref name=\"IJ\" /> opportunistic, and deceitful. She never plotted against her husband, but was quick to take advantage of his stroke to take control of Eiattu. When she realized that Imperial power was waning during her time as Moff, Tavira manipulated both the Priamsta and People's Liberation Battalion to retain control.<ref name=\"H1\" /> She planned to ransom Leia Organa and Tycho Celchu to the New Republic to secure their support in overthrowing Kavil as leader of the Corsairs<ref name=\"MQ2\" /> and later betrayed Sate Pestage to Ysanne Isard<ref name=\"MR2\" /> when his payment for her services did not meet her expectations.<ref name=\"MR1\" /> As leader of the Invid pirates, Tavira first gained the trust of the Jensaarai, then forced them to serve her by threatening the people of Susevfi. Tavira did not like being crossed;<ref name=\"IJ\" /> she held a longstanding grudge against Rogue Squadron, who she blamed for her downfall on Eiattu,<ref name=\"MQ2\" /> and she betrayed Phan Riizolo to the New Republic when he tried to break away from the Invids.<ref name=\"IJ\" /> She was also known to personally torture prisoners.<ref name=\"TWP2\" />\n\nWhile leading the Invids, Tavira quickly learned how to manage her pirate fleet. She recognized talent among those who served her and handed out promotions based on skill and initiative. She ensured that her pirates could not lead the New Republic to her by initiating all contact and not revealing her location, although Corran Horn was able to exploit this one-way communication to scare away many pirates on Courkrus before she could respond. Tavira saw herself as a major threat to the New Republic and believed that they would be willing to use all the resources at their disposal to stop her. Horn ultimately played on this belief, using the Force to convince her that a large New Republic fleet was present at Susevfi, convincing her to flee.<ref name=\"IJ\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLeonia Tavira was created by [[Michael A.
