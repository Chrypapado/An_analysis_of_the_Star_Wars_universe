She was an Elder of [[Cliff]], the birthplace of [[New Republic]] [[pilot]] [[Wyl Lark]]. Lark had called Dew his friend since he'd been fourteen years old, ever since she had caught and scolded Lark for spying on a stranger's [[Marriage|wedding]] feast. Some time after the [[Battle of Jakku]] but before [[11 ABY]]<ref name=\"Date\">This event takes place between the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY and the reunion of Wyl Lark, Chass na Chadic and Yrica Quell six years after the war in 11 ABY. Therefore, Lark's meeting with Conna Dew has to be between 5 ABY and 11 ABY.</ref>, Lark visited Dew when he had journeyed to Cliff to consult with a [[Sun-Lamas|Sun-Lama]] about treating a [[sur-avka]]'s mangled [[Claw (anatomy)|claw]]. He helped her yank desiccated husks of dead creeper vines off her house as she told Lark that her old caretaker had decided to become a Sun-Lama at the age of ninety-nine. After working and talking for a while, Dew told Lark that the [[Hik'e-Matriarch]] is looking for a [[senator]] to represent Polyneus in the [[New Republic Senate]] and suggested Lark as the best candidate. Shortly thereafter, Lark did become senator of Polyneus.<ref name=\"Victory's Price\">''[[Victory's Price]]''</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nConna Dew appeared in the [[2021]] novel ''[[Victory's Price]], written by [[Alexander Freed]].<ref name=\"Victory's Price\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Victory's Price]]'' {{1st|[[Victory's Price (audiobook)|''Victory's Price'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Victory's Price (audiobook)|''Victory's Price'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dew, Conna}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Polyneans]]"}}}]}}}}
