Together with her [[Juno Eclipse's father|husband]] and [[Juno Eclipse|daughter]], the Eclipse family resided on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. She was ultimately [[Death/Legends|killed]] in a crossfire between Imperial [[Loyalist/Legends|loyalists]] and [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|insurgents]] on their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], thus leaving her daughter to be raised by a negligent [[Parent/Legends|father]].\n\n==Biography==\nThe [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who gave birth to [[Juno Eclipse]] worked as a teacher on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. Her [[Juno Eclipse's father|husband]]&mdash;a man of the same [[Species/Legends|species]]&mdash;was a civilian [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]] who strongly supported the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. The [[New Order/Legends|New Order]] flourished on their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], although locals opposed [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] rule. Their [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|insurrection]] inadvertently caused the [[Death/Legends|death]] of Eclipse's mother, who died in a firefight between [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] and insurgents. She was survived by her husband and daughter.<ref name=\"TFUn\" />\n\nAlthough Juno Eclipse longed for her [[Parent/Legends|father's]] approval, the two were never close and eventually parted ways after Eclipse joined the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. By [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], she had very little memory of her mother due to the fact that she died while Eclipse was a young child. Eclipse ultimately defected from the Empire and became one of the first members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] in [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]].<ref name=\"TFUn\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJuno Eclipse's Human mother was a young, educated woman. She had long blond [[Hair/Legends|hair]], which she pinned back with a brooch made from a round [[black]] [[Stone/Legends|stone]].<ref name=\"TFUn\" /> Unlike her husband who adhered to the [[Human High Culture|Humanocentric]] policies of the New Order, she encouraged her daughter's fascination with [[Alien/Legends|alien]] cultures.<ref name=\"TFUdb\">[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'' in-game databank]]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJuno Eclipse's mother first appeared in the [[The Force Unleashed (novel)|novelization]] of the [[2008]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'']], written by author [[Sean Williams]].<ref name=\"TFUn\" /> She was also mentioned in the game's databank profile for Eclipse.<ref name=\"TFUdb\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[The Force Unleashed (novel)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'' novel]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'']] {{C|[[PlayStation 3|PS3]]/[[Xbox 360]] databank}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eclipse, Juno's mother}}\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified mothers]]"}}}]}}}}
