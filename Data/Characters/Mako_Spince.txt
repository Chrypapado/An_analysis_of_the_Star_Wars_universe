He worked as a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] and eventually became a [[traffic controller]] on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:MakoSpinceEGC.jpg|thumb|left|Mako Spince]]\n\nAlthough Mako had a sharp mind and was healthy, he decided to waste his time and his father's money. After the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Mako finally decided to join the military. Though he was only twenty, Mako was considered too old to join the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]]. Mako only managed to get in because of his father, and because advisors at the Academy believed that Mako would follow his father's example.\n\nDespite their hopes, Mako proved to be rather a nuisance to the Academy by disobeying orders and breaking rules. He made friends with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and also with [[ZZ-4Z]], the [[JV-Z1/D butler droid|butler droid]] of Dean [[Horace Wyrmyr]]. Through the droid, Mako learned many secrets of the man's past. Mako's pranks went too far when he stole some [[antimatter]] and used it to blow up the Academy's [[Mascot Moon]]&mdash;he had only intended to blow the Academy's seal off of the face of the small \"moon,\" but he underestimated the size of the explosion and inadvertently destroyed the entire satellite. For this catastrophe, Mako was expelled [[8 BBY|two years]] before his friend Han graduated. As he left the Academy, Mako stole ZZ-4Z, who was going to be used for scrap at the recycle plant.\n\nMako disappeared from the Imperial Academy's surrounding area and became a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]]. He later helped Han Solo (who was later dismissed from the military for rescuing a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] slave called [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]) learn the smuggling trade. From then on, Han and Chewbacca followed Mako around as his sidekicks, and a short time into their work Han also won ZZ-4Z in a game of [[Sabacc/Legends|Sabacc]].\n\nMako and Han created their headquarters on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], and the money from their smuggling missions came reeling in. Their greatest venture together was the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]]. However, two years later, there was a major setback: When Mako was on a smuggling run in the [[Ottega system/Legends|Ottega system]] he was captured by the [[NaQoit Bandits]], who crippled him, thus forcing him to retire and become confined to a [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsor]] chair. Since he could no longer work as a smuggler, he became a traffic controller. He saw Han Solo before Han left Nar Shaddaa, but he would not meet his old friend until several years later.\n\nWhen Han Solo returned to Nar Shaddaa a decade later, a bitter and older Mako allowed him safe passage but contacted [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] and [[Dengar/Legends|Dengar]] so that he could get enough money to retire from his pitiful job. Unfortunately for the bounty hunters, Han and [[Leia Organa Solo]] escaped. The next time Han turned up, Mako contacted the Star Destroyer ''Invincible'', but things were to turn fatal for Mako when Han piloted the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] behind Mako's traffic control pylon. The pylon was caught up in the Star Destroyer's tractor beam, spearing the craft and blowing both vehicles up. Mako's second double cross had been his final undoing.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Dark Empire Sourcebook|story=The Hearing}}\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*{{Tales|2|Routine}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*{{WEGCite|book=Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook|story=The Regalia of Office}} {{Mo}}\n*[[Dark Empire 3|''Dark Empire'' 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Empire 4|''Dark Empire'' 4]]\n*[[Dark Empire (audio)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]]\n*[[Dark Empire II 2|''Dark Empire II'' 2]]\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Dark Empire endnotes|''Dark Empire'' endnotes]]\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]'' <!--February 1999; page 40-->\n*''[[Aurra Sing: Dawn of the Bounty Hunters]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{FFCite|40|German Edition - SPI1-2, ''Mako Spince''}}\n*{{FFCite|77|FET27-28, ''Boba Fett''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|106|Han Solo: The Early Years}}\n*{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Han|archivedate=20110903234809}}\n*{{InsiderCite|159|Death to the Dark Side!: The Making of Dark Empire &ndash; Part III}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Mako Spince\n|de=Mako Spince\n|es=Mako Spince\n|ru=\u041c\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0421\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spince, Mako}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy pilots of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Individuals with disabilities]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
