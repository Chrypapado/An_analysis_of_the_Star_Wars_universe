At the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], the clan consisted of only eight hundred people.\n\n==History==\n===Upholding tradition===\nAround [[10,000 BBY]], the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] was discovered by the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Although their society was still in a primitive state,<ref name=\"Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds\">''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''</ref> the Twi'leks had spent the past several centuries in relative harmony with one another,<ref name=\"The Holonet\">{{Holonet|old=true|inhabitants|twilek|Twi'lek}}</ref> and they joined the Republic soon after being discovered.<ref name=\"The Essential Atlas\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref>\n\nTwi'lek society was comprised of a series of [[:Category:Twi'lek clans|clans]] of various sizes. When [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] took a sudden interest in Ryloth's wealth of [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]], the Twi'lek clan leaders increased production of the drug and prepared to ship it offworld.<ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\">{{FFCite|96|TWI19\u201322, ''Twi'leks - Oola''}}</ref> Unfortunately, the clans were inexperienced in the galactic economy, and [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[:Category:Criminals|criminal]] cartels soon took control of the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] [[Mining/Legends|mining]] operations. The Twi'leks were [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] and labored in their own mines for the profit of the Hutts, or were sold outright on the open market. After generations of slavery, the Twi'lek [[Species/Legends|species]] became far more numerous across the galaxy than on Ryloth,<ref name=\"The Essential Atlas\" /> and most felt little connection to their own homeworld.<ref name=\"The Holonet\" />\n\nSometime after [[3640 BBY]], the Twi'lek clans regained control of their planet from the Hutts, but the prosperity of their ryll mines still made them targets of [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] and [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]]. To ensure their continued wealth, most of the Twi'lek clan leaders chose to deter such threats by selling their own people&mdash;in particular, their [[Gender/Legends|women]]&mdash;into slavery.<ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\" /> The sale of Twi'lek dancing girls was continually tolerated by the Republic, and slavery remained Ryloth's primary [[Currency/Legends|currency]] as it had for past millennia, while the ryll trade fueled the planet's [[Black market/Legends|black market]] economy.<ref name=\"The Essential Atlas\" />\n\nRyloth Clan, however, was different. Located deep in Ryloth's underground warrens, this clan remained isolated from galactic influence, striving to honor the faith and dignity of Twi'leki traditions&mdash;while the rest of the world rushed to accommodate slavers and [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]]. More modernized Twi'leks disdained the clan's quaint, primitive ways.<ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" /> Despite Ryloth Clan's values, Twi'lek females were treated as poorly as anywhere else on the world. They were still regarded as objects, little more than beautiful, breathing ornaments, and to prevent them from undermining the authority of Twi'lek males, the women were not educated.<ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\" /> One of the primitive clan's customs dictated that a female could only be taken from her [[Parent/Legends|father]] if he received payment for her.<ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" /><ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Ryloth Clan was comprised of eight hundred people, all of whom acknowledged [[Oola's father/Legends|Oola's father]] as clan [[Chief/Legends|chief]]. This prestigious position gave both himself and his family considerable power and influence.<ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\" /> While her father was the renowned leader of Ryloth Clan, [[Oola/Legends|Oola]], in turn, was a renowned [[:Category:Performing artists|dancer]] with dozens of admirers.<ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" /> Considered one of the most attractive Twi'leks already, Oola increased her appeal through sensual dancing, enhanced by movements of her [[Lekku/Legends|lekku]]. Regarded as irresistible to all males of her species, Oola eventually attracted the lewd attentions of a dangerous admirer: [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Official Figurine Collection 45\" /> Having spent two [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] searching for the perfect woman for his master, [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], Fortuna had suddenly found her in Oola.<ref name=\"Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)\">[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi'', Second Edition]]</ref> Uncertain whether her father would agree to sell her, Fortuna violated the clan's custom and abducted Oola during the night.<ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" /><ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\" />\n\nOola was brainwashed, had her [[Tooth/Legends|teeth]] sanded flat&mdash;a typical slaving practice to prevent Twi'lek women from biting their masters&mdash;and was trained for [[Standard month/Legends|months]] in lewd, seductive dance meant to entice her new master, Jabba the Hutt.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance]]''</ref><ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\" /> Once she was delivered, the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] was so pleased with Fortuna's \"gift\" that he made Oola his concubine, chained at his side to await his affections.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Official Figurine Collection 45\" /> Oola was terrified and disgusted by Jabba, and when she stopped submitting to his grotesque advances, the Hutt fed her to [[Jabba's rancor|his rancor]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (novel)\">[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (novel){{!}}''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' novel]]</ref>\n\n[[Nolaa Tarkona]], Oola's half-sister, was also sold into slavery, but she revolted against her masters and began a rebellion that toppled Ryloth's [[:Category:Governments|government]]&mdash;making Nolaa the first female Twi'lek leader in the [[Timeline of galactic history/Legends|history of the galaxy]].<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Bounty\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Bounty]]''</ref> Nolaa spent years trying to uncover what became of Oola after her abduction from the clan, and eventually received a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] [[Hologram/Legends|holorecord]] that detailed her half-sister's ordeal as Jabba's slave.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance\" />\n\nBy [[23 ABY/Legends|23 ABY]], Nolaa had founded the [[Diversity Alliance]], a radical [[Anti-Humanism|anti-Human]] political movement funded by Ryloth's profits from the ryll trade.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance\" /><ref name=\"The Essential Chronology\">[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]</ref> Embittered by Oola's fate and her own experiences, Nolaa sought to punish [[Human/Legends|Humans]] for the atrocities of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and other [[Humanocentrism|Humanocentric]] transgressions. After rallying support for the Diversity Alliance from all across the galaxy, Nolaa united numerous [[Alien/Legends|alien]] races against the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], and also succeeded in halting all trafficking in sentient beings, including that of Twi'lek females. However, the Alliance's true nature was revealed when Tarkona gained access to the [[Emperor's Plague Storehouse]] with the goal of exterminating the entire Human race. The Diversity Alliance was defeated at the [[Battle of the Emperor's Plague Storehouse]], and although Nolaa escaped, she had been infected by one of the plagues and [[Death/Legends|died]] soon after.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: The Emperor's Plague\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Emperor's Plague]]''</ref><ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlthough [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] [[:Category:Twi'lek clans|Clan]] has been mentioned in various sources dating as far back as [[1990]],<ref name=\"Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (First Edition)\" /> the clan itself has never been shown beyond two of its members, the half-sisters [[Nolaa Tarkona]] and [[Oola/Legends|Oola]]. It is unknown which [[Parent/Legends|parent]] they share: either [[Oola's father/Legends|Oola's father]] (the clan's [[Chief/Legends|chief]]) or an unmentioned mother.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance\" />\n\nThe clan was not given a name until ''[[Star Wars: The Official Figurine Collection 45]]'' was printed in [[2007]]. While this is a [[canon]]ical source, the generalized nature of the name is suspicious&mdash;[[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] being [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] to all [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'leks]], but one small clan taking it for a name&mdash;and it may be no more than an error.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Official Figurine Collection 45\" />\n\nIt is possible that [[Sienn'rha]] is also a member of Ryloth Clan, as she was abducted along with Oola and comes from a primitive clan as seen in ''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'', though no source explicitly states that the two dancers are from the same clan.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Official Figurine Collection 45\" /><ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" /><ref name=\"The Official Fact File 96\" /><ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref><ref name=\"X-Wing: The Krytos Trap\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Time to Mourn, a Time to Dance: Oola's Tale]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{Topps|set=1996 Topps Star Wars Finest|cardname=Oola}}\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*{{FFCite|96|TWI19\u201322, ''Twi'leks - Oola''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Figurine Collection 45]]'' {{1stID}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|oola|Oola|archivedate=20110524221931}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'lek clans]]\n[[Category:Twi'lek culture]]"}}}]}}}}
