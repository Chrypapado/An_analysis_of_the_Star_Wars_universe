She befriended a fellow [[officer]] [[Ciena Ree]], and served the [[Death Squadron]] aboard the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator]]'' following her graduation from the [[Academy for Young Imperials|Imperial Academy]] on [[Lothal]]. Later she served aboard the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]''. She was [[Death|killed]] when the ''Executor'' was destroyed at the [[Battle of Endor]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Background===\nBerisse Sai graduated from the [[Academy for Young Imperials|Imperial Academy]] on [[Lothal]] a [[Standard year|year]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]]. [[Lieutenant]] Sai was stationed aboard the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] where [[Gender|she]] befriended Lieutenant [[Ciena Ree]], a [[Jelucan]]i graduate from the [[Royal Imperial Academy]] on [[Coruscant]], and promised to show her around the [[Star Destroyer]]. After learning about the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]], she offered some sympathy for the [[Alderaanian]] [[Imperial officer]] [[Nash Windrider]], remarking that his entire [[planet]] had turned traitor.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n===Meeting Darth Vader===\n[[File:VaderAboardGozanti.png|thumb|left|250px|Berisse and Ciena were ordered to rendezvous with Darth Vader after the Battle of Yavin.]]\nFollowing the destruction of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], Sai and Ree were ordered to take a [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class freighter]] to the [[Yavin system]] to rendezvous with [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and bring him back to the ''[[Devastator]]''. Their [[commander]] ordered them to keep their mission secret and to maintain communications silence unless otherwise ordered by [[Sith Lord|Lord]] Vader. During the [[hyperspace]] journey, Berisse asked Ciena whether they were supposed to fly to the totally silent Death Star without asking questions.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\nCiena responded that it would make more sense when they got there. Sai introduced herself as Berisse and Ciena followed suit. Upon exiting hyperspace, the two stumbled upon the wrecked remains of the Death Star, which had been destroyed by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. After picking up a signal from [[Darth Vader's TIE Advanced|Darth Vader's]] [[TIE Advanced x1]], Berisse helped Ciena extend the docking tube onto the top of Vader's [[TIE line|TIE fighter]].<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\nAfter boarding the [[freighter]], Vader ordered Ciena and Berisse to remain in the hold for the remainder of the voyage. He then took command of the freighter for their return journey to the ''Devastator''. During the return journey, an apologetic Berisse remarked that Vader could be a little overpowering at first glance. When Berisse added that she was frightened by his respirator, Ciena warned that he could be monitoring them right now. Berisse kept quiet for the rest of the journey.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n===Ciena's friend===\nSeveral [[Standard day|days]] later, Berisse was resting in her bunk when Ciena raised the matter of Windrider's stressed state. Berisse thought that Ciena was thinking about Nash because it was the only thing that kept her from thinking about her fellow Jelucani [[officer]] [[Thane Kyrell]]. Ciena denied having any romantic feelings for Thane. Berisse responded that she had observed Ciena's infatuation with Thane during her off-duty [[Standard hour|hours]]. When Ciena returned to the subject of Nash, Berisse responded that he was taking extra shifts to keep himself busy. Berisse supported Ciena's suggestion that they invite Thane out for [[grav-ball]].<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n[[2 ABY|Two years]] after the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], Berisse along with Nash and Ciena were transferred to Vader's [[flagship]], the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]''. Berisse's [[birthday]] occurred shortly before the [[Battle of Hoth]]. Despite driving the rebels from [[Echo Base]] and [[Death|killing]] hundreds of rebels, Vader's strike force lost three [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]], several dozen [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], and hundreds of [[snowtrooper]]s. Other rebel forces managed to escape and rejoin the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]].<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\nFollowing the [[Escape from Cloud City|escape]] from [[Cloud City]], Berisse met with Ciena and Nash. When Ciena asked why people would join the Rebellion, Berisse dismissed them as misfits and [[Thief|robbers]] who hated normal society. When Berisse and Nash asked why she had raised the matter, Ciena confided that she was still affected by Thane's alleged [[suicide]]. Berisse and Nash were unaware that Thane had joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. When Nash expressed disbelief that Thane would commit suicide, Berisse explained that they were all affected by the destruction of the Death Star.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\nAfter Nash had pressed Ciena for more information about Thane, Berisse speculated that it was something that had happened on his [[homeworld]] of Jelucan. Nash shared pointed out that Thane had been physically abused by his [[Parent|father]] [[Oris Kyrell]], stating that he had seen scars on his back. Berisse then departed and let Ciena and Nash spend time together.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n===Battle of Endor===\n[[File:LSManga-NashCienaBerisse.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Berisse believed that rebuilding the Death Star was a way to honor the memory of the Imperials who died on the first one.]]\nIn the period leading up to the [[Battle of Endor]], the ''Executor'' was dispatched to the [[Hudalla system]]. During that [[time]], Berisse noticed that Ciena had been angry for the past three [[Standard week|weeks]]. Ciena was angry that her mother [[Paron Ree]] had been framed and [[Prison|imprisoned]] for embezzlement. Despite being close friends, Ciena did not confide in Berisse because of her friend's loyalty to the Empire. While waiting, Berisse assisted Ciena in a [[flamethrower]] training session by operating the holographic visuals. Shortly later, the ''Executor'' exited hyperspace in the Hudalla [[Star system|system]] and discovered a large [[Imperial Navy|Imperial fleet]]. Both Berisse and Ciena expressed bemusement. The Imperial [[fleet]] had been dispatched to lure rebel starfighters into a trap, leading to a [[Dogfight in the Hudalla system|dogfight]]. During the dogfight, Ciena and Nash \"discovered\" that Thane had joined the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\nFollowing the dogfight, Berisse and her comrades were dispatched to the [[Endor system]], which harbored the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]]. Berisse, Ciena, and Nash were among the hundreds of Imperial personnel invited to greet [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]. Prior to the Emperor's arrival, Berisse expressed elation but worried that their view would be obscured by the large gathering. While traveling to the [[hangar]] in a [[turbolift]], Ciena expressed her shock that the Empire had built another Death Star. By contrast, Berisse regarded the existence second Death Star as a positive development and marveled at how long they had taken to construct it.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\nWhen Ciena expressed skepticism, Berisse sharply responded that they had to rebuild the Death Star in order to honor the memory of Imperials who had died during the Battle of Yavin. She remarked that the existence of the second Death Star would end opposition to the Emperor's rule and cause the Rebellion to melt away. Nash supported Berisse's arguments and reassured Ciena that rebuilding the Death Star would send a clear message to the rebels that their luck had run out and that the Empire was the only galactic authority. While Nash was talking to Ciena, Berisse reminded her comrades to move into position to await the arrival of the Emperor's [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|shuttle]].<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n[[File:FleetJunkiesCloseYourEyes-ROTJHD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Berisse was on the ''Executor'' when it crashed into the second Death Star]]\nDuring the Battle of [[Endor]], Berisse perished after the ''Executor'' crashed into the second Death Star and exploded. The battle also saw the deaths of the Emperor and [[Darth]] Vader, turning the tide of the [[Galactic Civil War]] against the Empire. Berisse's comrades Ciena Ree and Nash Windrider survived the battle and would participate in the [[Battle of Jakku]], the Empire's last stand against the [[New Republic]], the successor government created by the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBerisse Sai was a [[human]] [[Gender|woman]] from Lothal with tan skin and a stout physique. She had dark, shining, tightly braided [[hair]]. Berisse struck a friendship with her fellow Imperial [[Navy]] officers Ciena Ree and Nash Windrider. Berisse enjoyed hanging out with her fellow officers, often offering to meet up at the [[cantina]]. She was aware of Ciena's feelings for Thane. Berisse had a habit of telling jokes, some of which were not repeatable to Ciena's parents. Nonetheless, Ciena felt comfortable confiding in her, noting that she was helpful, sympathetic, matter-of-fact, and practical. Berisse's relationship with Ciena became strained after Ciena's mother Verine Ree was framed for embezzlement. Berisse grew disconcerted with Ciena's bad moods. Ciena found herself no longer able to confide in Berisse, fearing that Berisse would question her loyalty to the Empire.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\nBerisse was firmly devoted to the Empire and viewed the rebels as robbers and misfits who could not fit into normal society. She later sought to justify the existence of the second Death Star by claiming that it would end resistance to the Empire and that building it would honor the memory of fallen Imperials who had died during the destruction of the first Death Star. Despite their differences, Ciena was grief-stricken by the loss of her friend Berisse.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBerisse Sai first appeared in ''[[Lost Stars]]'', a young adult novel written by [[Claudia Gray]] as part of ''[[Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' series.<ref name=\"LS\" /> Gray mentally pictured Sai as being portrayed by [[Wikipedia:America Ferrera|America Ferrera]].{{Fact}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lost Stars]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Lost Stars (audiobook)|''Lost Stars'' audiobook]]\n*[[Lost Stars (webcomic)|''Lost Stars'' webcomic]] {{1stp}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFGXW2|Galactic Empire Conversion Kit|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Lieutenant_Sai|cardname=Lieutenant Sai}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Berisse Sai\n|ru=\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u0439\n|ko=\ubca0\ub9ac\uc2a4 \uc0ac\uc774\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sai, Berisse}}\n[[Category:Death Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Lothalites]]"}}}]}}}}
