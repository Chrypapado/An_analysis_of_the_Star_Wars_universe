He informed [[General/Legends|General]] [[Aves (general)|Aves]] and [[Cole Cantarus]] that the Republic troops in the [[Labor Valley]] of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] were being taken out by advanced [[Droid/Legends|droids]] developed by [[Danison Varik]]. Belos arranged for Deena Behar to meet with a Republic citizen and provide her with all information necessary to stop the droid production. Deena's lengthy plan involved activating the [[Beharen Droid Factory]] by activating the power generators located in the [[Hellfire]] to produce disaster relief droids able to break through the durasteel doors protecting Varik's laboratory. After giving all instructions, Deena departed, leaving the Republic citizen to do the work.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Behar, Deena}}\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
