Huge and fierce-looking even by Sanyassan standards, he was the chief of the [[Sanyassan Marauders|Marauders]], a band of criminals who engaged in spaceways [[Pirate/Legends|piracy]]. A [[Standard century/Legends|century]] before the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Terak and his Marauders joined with [[Charal]], a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Forceful]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who possessed a [[Talisman of the Raven|magic ring]]. Traveling through the [[Moddell sector/Legends|Moddell sector]] in a stolen [[Starship/Legends|starship]], they crashed on the lush [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon of Endor]]. Resigned to their fate, the Marauders constructed a [[castle]] in the plains of Endor, where they were ruled by the self-appointed King Terak, and Charal his accomplice.\n\nIn the months leading to his destruction, Terak [[Death/Legends|murdered]] most of the [[Towani family|Towani]], a family of [[Human/Legends|Humans]] who were themselves castaways on Endor. The king wished to obtain the [[crystal oscillator]] from their spacecraft, as he believed it to be \"the Power\" he was looking for. Having captured the crystal, Terak had no idea how to release its energy. He tried to compel the young [[Cindel Towani]], last survivor of the Towani family, into revealing the secrets of the crystal. But the little girl was unable to answer the king's questions, and he [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] her.\n\nThe [[Standard day/Legends|day]] after her capture, Cindel was freed from the Marauder's dungeons by her peaceful Endorian friends. Terak ordered the witch Charal to transform into a [[raven]] to lead him to the Humans, so he could retrieve the crystal. The warlord kept the Nightsister's magic ring to guarantee she wouldn't betray him. This, however, led Terak to his ultimate demise; during a pitched fight, the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] hero [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Warrick]] struck the ring with a stone, causing it to activate, and the evil Marauder was burnt to a crisp.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|There was a time when each of those who you see before you were kings of the stars.

The only survivor, a pink-skinned Sanyassan named [[Indar (Marauder)|Indar]], reported their defeat was due to a single Ewok holyman wielding a powerful [[magic wand]]. The warlord hoped this scepter contained the elusive \"Power\" that would help him leave Endor. King Terak seized the opportunity. He bartered with a passing-by [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]], sending the offworlder on a mission to kill the Ewok priest and return to the Marauders Stronghold with his magic metal staff. When the spacer returned with the staff, it proved to be a sham. Terak understood that Indar had lied to him in hopes of covering up his cowardice during the ambush with Ewok warriors. The warlord was incensed about this act of treachery, and he ordered the spacer to retrieve and kill Indar.<ref name=\"gal\" />\n\nA bit later, Terak's scouts reported a ship had crashed not far from the Stronghold. The king ordered the spacer to raid the shipwreck and take anything he could find, especially potential sources of power. When the spacer returned with a [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] generator, Terak was overjoyed. The warlord immediately ordered the Sanyassan [[Academician|scholar]] [[Szingo]] to study it carefully. As a last assignment Terak also tasked the spacer with stopping two Ewok warriors who intended to raid the Stronghold. abundantly insisted that the matter should be resolved in the most violent and bloody manner.<ref name=\"gal\" />\n\n====The Emperor's scouts====\n{{Quote|Terak, the king of the marauders, holds his mercenary pirates together while he search for a new power source to be installed on their long-disassembled attack ship.|Pfilbee Jhorn, on Terak|The Illustrated Star Wars Universe}}\nSeveral years before the Battle of Endor in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] sent a scouting expedition to Endor, where [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] wished to build the [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generator]] for his [[Death Star II/Legends|new]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]]. Terak and his Marauders captured the scouting party, which included the [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]] [[Pfilbee Jhorn]]. While the Imperial team contemplated an alliance with the Marauders, Terak and his goons did not see it that way. The King ordered the Imperials brought to his dungeons, where a few of them were [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] to death. While his prisoners were still in jail, the Sanyassan warlord discovered that his mystic Charal had plotted behind his back. The Dathomiri had freed the Imperials for a promise to take her offworld with them. Outraged by that act of [[Treason/Legends|treason]], Terak put Charal behind bars for a time.<ref name=\"ISWU\" />\n\n===The Battle for Endor===\n{{Quote|How dare you suggest that I am to blame!|Terak|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\n[[File:Terak_throne.png|thumb|left|150px|Terak on his throne with the crystal oscillator]]\nTerak's obsession with obtaining what he called the \"Power\" increased over the years. About a century after Terak's arrival on the moon, by the year 3.5 ABY, a family of Humans called the Towani were stranded on the Forest Moon. One day, Terak and the sorceress Charal led a raid on [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]], where the Towani were sheltered. Terak confronted the father, [[Jeremitt Towani]], who was trying to repair his ship, and demanded the \"Power.\" The king seized the power cell from the starcruiser and killed the unarmed Human. Jeremitt's daughter, the young Cindel Towani, was able to escape while Ewoks were gathered up to be taken back to Terak's castle. The girl's escape, however, was short-lived&mdash;she was captured by Charal and placed in a prison carriage with her Ewok friend Wicket Warrick. When he looked at his young Human [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]], Terak thought Cindel was \"a pretty prize.\" With the other Ewoks' help, Towani and Warrick escaped from the carriage, but Terak only sent a few Marauders after them.<ref name=\"BFE\" />\n\nAt the Marauders' keep, King Terak wanted Charal to get the oscillator crystal to work by chanting over it, to no avail. According to the witch, her spies had located Cindel Towani in the woods, near the [[Noa Briqualon's hut|hut]] of the old scout Noa Briqualon. She suggested the young girl might know the secret of the magic crystal and could be forced to share it with Terak. The Sanyassan king agreed, and he ordered the witch to bring the child back. When Towani was taken before him, Terak and ordered her to release the \"Power,\" but she answered the crystal was not magic and was only a machine part. But Terak did not believe her, and he had both the girl and Charal taken to the dungeon with the Ewoks captives. The king threatened to execute all the prisoners if Towani hadn't shown the secret of the crystal before dawn.<ref name=\"BFE\" />\n\nThat night, the Marauders held a banquet in castle hall. Terak remained seated on his [[Throne/Legends|throne]] with a pint of alcohol, hoping the little girl would eventually change her mind. Suddenly, an alarm bell started ringing from the dungeons, meaning the prisoners had escaped. Terak headed for the cellblocks, even as the prisoners were blasting a hole in the wall to escape through. The king learned that Cindel and the Ewoks had been freed by their friends, Noa Briqualon, Wicket Warrick and a creature known as Teek. The enraged warlord then freed Charal to help him trace the fugitives back. The sorceress used her ring and turned into a raven, but Terak grabbed the bird by the leg and seized the ring so Charal would not run away and betray him.<ref name=\"BFE\" />\n\n[[File:Terak_burning.png|thumb|200px|King Terak was burned to his death]]\nThe Marauders army eventually found the fugitives, but the Ewoks put up [[Battle of Endor (Ewok\u2013Sanyassan conflict)|a valiant defense]] while Noa Briqualon was trying to get his starship running using the energy cell from the Towani spacecraft. During the skirmish, Cindel Towani was captured by Terak, even as the other Marauders retreated. A climactic duel ensued between the towering Sanyassan and Briqualon. The old hermit was able to strike many good blows, but Terak ended up chopping Briqualon's staff in two with his machete. When it seemed that the warlord had won the fight, Wicket Warrick used his [[Slingshot/Legends|slingshot]] and damaged Charal's ring, which Terak wore in a pendant round his neck.<ref name=\"BFE\" /> The talisman shattered, releasing a great amount of energy, and the Marauder king was burned from the inside-out.<ref name=\"dbter\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nTerak's death created a power vacuum in the Marauders' society.

Even before his arrival at Endor, he was a vicious and bloodthirsty warlord and became obsessed with obtaining what he called the \"Power,\" which he was convinced would allow him to leave Endor and conquer the galaxy. Fortunately for the rest of the galaxy, Terak's strength was not equaled by his intelligence. His way of thinking was more in the superstitious form than the scientific form. Otherwise he could have simply taken the Towanis' ship. Instead, Terak believed beyond a shadow of a doubt that the oscillator by itself was the key to letting him and the other Marauders leave Endor.
