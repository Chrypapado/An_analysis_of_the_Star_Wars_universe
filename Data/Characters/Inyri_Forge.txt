The younger sister of former Rogue [[Lujayne Forge]], Inyri joined [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] shortly after the conquest of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].\n\n==Biography==\nInyri was born on Kessel to [[Kassar Forge|Kassar]] and [[Myda Forge]]. Kassar was a teacher who volunteered to go to Kessel under a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] program to educate inmates on how to re-enter society upon release. Her mother was one of the inmate students who fell in love with him and decided to stay with him on Kessel.\n\nInyri had multiple brothers and sisters (including [[Lujayne Forge|Lujayne]]), all of whom were still alive and living on Kessel in [[6 ABY/Legends|6.5 ABY]].\n\n[[File:Inyri.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Inyri Forge]]\nWhile planning the Coruscant battle, officials decided to free some high profile prisoners in order to cause chaos in the heart of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. One of those prisoners was [[Zekka Thyne]], of the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] organization. Along with Zekka came Inyri, his \"[[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]] [[cutter]]\" and lover. Inyri, being born on Kessel, and not sent there, was not a criminal, but she was insistent on staying with Zekka, even when the squadron offered to aid her.\n\nHowever, things changed as the undercover mission on Coruscant progressed. Inyri began to rethink her loyalty towards Zekka, especially after an incident when they came under fire, and he ran to save himself while Rogue member [[Gavin Darklighter]] came to her aid.\n\nFinally, things came to a head when Zekka attempted to kill [[Corran Horn]], whom he blamed for putting him on Kessel in the first place. Inyri shot and killed Zekka before he could go through with it. Having proven herself, Inyri joined the Rogues for the Coruscant battle, and was inducted formally into the squadron in the celebration afterwards.\n\nInyri had been a steady member of Rogue Squadron ever since. She was a member of [[Requiem Squadron]] where she was disguised as Inyon Fass. She had bright red hair and was the sister of [[Teekon Fass]].\n\nLater she achieved the rank of [[Major/Legends|Major]] during the [[Caamas Document Crisis]], and continued to serve with the squadron well into the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], fighting in the [[Battle of Dantooine (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Dantooine]] and the [[Battle of Kalarba]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Rogue Six/Legends|Rogue Six]]\n|years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]]\n|before=[[Riv Shiel]]\n|after=[[Gavin Darklighter]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Rogue Twelve]]\n|years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7.5 ABY]] &mdash;\n|before=[[Aril Nunb]]\n|after=Eventually [[Anni Capstan]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Rogue Five/Legends|Rogue Five]]\n|years=[[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]]\n|before=Eventually [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]]\n|after=Unknown\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Inyri Forge\n|de=Inyri Forge\n|ru=\u0418\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0438 \u0424\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0436\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forge, Inyri}}\n[[Category:Antilles's Rogues]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Alliance individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kesselians]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Delak Krennel's regime]]\n[[Category:Rogue Squadron personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
