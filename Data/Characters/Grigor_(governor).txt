He oppressed the indigenous [[H'drachi]], and eliminated at least one Rebel cell with a stormtrooper assault.\n\nGrigor was working in league with Ambassador [[Jollie]] to cover up these events, and became of aware of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Lynch Hauser]]'s suspicions about his activities. Seeking to legitimize his rule in the eyes of the local population, he captured 'Queen' [[Mora]], a descendant of the former M'haeli Human royal family, and broadcast his intentions to marry her. Grigor died at the [[Battle of Red Rock]] after he was arrested by Imperial officer [[Ranulf Trommer/Legends|Ranulf Trommer]], who had been sent by Grand Moff Lynch to investigate the situation. His life ruined, he attempted to escape by holding Mora at gunpoint. A swift kick by Ranulf, however, redirected the blaster towards his own head, where it subsequently went off, killing him instantly.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: River of Chaos]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*{{FFCite|101|WID4, ''Widget''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Governors of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:M'haeli residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
