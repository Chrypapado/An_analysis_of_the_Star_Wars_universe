Sometime in [[44 ABY]], Volgh Squadron participated in the [[Evacuation of Ossus|evacuation]] of the [[New Jedi Order]] from the [[Jedi Academy (Ossus)|Jedi Academy]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]], after the [[Jedi academy|academy]] came under attack by the [[Lost Tribe of Sith]]. During the evacuation, Volgh Leader and her wingmate were ordered to disable the [[ion drive]]s of the [[Hapan]] transport ''[[Sharmok 718]]'', suspected to have been captured by the Sith. Volgh Leader's shots were evaded by the transport but was eventually hit by the wingmate's lasers. Rather than be boarded, ''Sharmok 718'' detonated its stockpile of [[Baradium/Legends|baradium]] and self destructed, destroying all of Volgh Squadron along with it.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse]]'' {{1st|''Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse'' audiobook}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse'' audiobook]]\n\n[[Category:Hapans]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Unidentified military personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
