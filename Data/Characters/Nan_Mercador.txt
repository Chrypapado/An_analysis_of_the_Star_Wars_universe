Oh, yes, of course. Absolutely. He's a good friend of mine. Let me give him a call.|Nan Mercador|Boba Fett: The Fight to Survive}}\n'''Nan Mercador''' was the proprietor of a drinking establishment on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] known as the [[Golden Cuff Tavern]]. Throughout his long career, Nan developed a network of contacts within the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] community and used his bar as a stopgap locale for luring wanted marks to their doom.\n\n==Biography==\nShortly after the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|First Battle of Geonosis]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the young orphan known as [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] entered Nan's bar inquiring about a man named [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]]. Ironically, Dooku had likewise developed an interest in young Boba and hired several bounty hunters to capture him. Mercador secretly contacted two of his allies, a [[Diollan]] and a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] bounty hunter, and told them where they could find Boba. He stalled Boba at the Golden Cuff with free cups of juice while he waited for the mercenaries to arrive. However, upon discovering how much Boba was worth, Nan decided to claim the bounty for himself. He grabbed Boba Fett and dragged him behind the bar. Boba struggled with the larger man and managed to free himself by kicking at one of the overhead light fixtures, sending a rain of glass down on top of Nan's head. Moments later, another bounty hunter named [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] entered the tavern and blasted Mercador in the back with a stun weapon. She grabbed Boba and claimed the bounty on him.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nNan Mercador was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] with dark crimson skin and four arms.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Boba Fett: The Fight to Survive]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nan Mercador\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mercador, Nan}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
