The clan was stationed a the [[Bogden Jedi chapter house|Jedi chapter house]] on [[Bogden 3]]. They were awaiting transport back to the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]], which had been delayed due to the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|battle]] there. When masters K'Kruhk and [[Sian Jeisel]] arrived with their clone troopers, [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] was issued. Several of the younglings were [[Massacre on Bogden 3|killed]] as [[Du Mahn]] defended them. K'Kruhk and Piru ultimately escaped with nine younglings to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, Jiro was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk.<ref name=\"DTP\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Times: Parallels]]''</ref>\n\nJiro was present when [[Lumbra]] and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that the broken ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, fellow youngling, [[Seddwia]], jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi younglings, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. As they were being led, Jiro asked [[Kennan Taanzer]] what they could do. Kennan replied: \"Concentrate on staying on our feet...Focus on staying alive.\"<ref name=\"DTP\" />\n\nThe younglings were freed by [[K'Kruhk]], who gave in to un-Jedi-like behavior briefly. With the help of Chase Piru he shot down Lumbra's men with arrows. Lumbra and his shipmate, Callow, died at the hands of K'Kruhk's lightsaber. After the conflict, K'Kruhk didn't want to be a constant reminder of what he had done and was going to leave the Soaring Hawkbat Clan after dropping them off on another planet. <ref name=\"DTP\" />\n\n===Arkinnea===\nJiro and the rest of the Jedi crash-landed on the [[planet]] [[Arkinnea]] and were taken into custody by the [[Arkinnea Militia]]. He was placed into a refugee camp and watched when K'Kruhk broke up a fight between refugees. He listened to [[Unidentified female refugee|fellow refugee]] as she explained the workings of the camp to Piru. The youngling was present when Master [[Zao]] found them in the refugee camp. After dinner, Jiro sat down with the rest of the younglings as Zao taught them their daily lesson. The Jedi master tossed three spice berries in the air and caught one in each hand and the last in his mouth. While the younglings could tell where each berry went, they couldn't answer Zao's question about which was the sweetest. Jiro complained that it was an unfair test.<ref name=\"FC1\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 1]]''</ref>\n\nJiro, along with the rest of the younglings and Jedi, escaped the refugee camp under the cover of darkness and made their way out into the Arkinnean countryside. He and the other younglings scavenged fields, picking [[Beelpop melon]]s and other [[vegetable/Legends|vegetables]]. When K'Kruhk returned with a [[Wooly|pack beast]] to help them in their journey, Jiro ran up to greet him. They continued their trip, and Jiro took a nap in the back of the [[Repulsorcart/Legends|repulsorcart]] with the rest of the children. They reached a hill, and Jiro joined in with the rest of the younglings as they raced Piru to the top. When they reached the top, Jiro was shocked to discover an open mass grave where the Arkinnea Militia had been dropping refugees to their deaths.<ref name=\"FC2\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 2]]''</ref>  He then watched in horror as an ore carrier flew over the valley and dropped another load of refugees to their deaths. When K'Kruhk realized the group had been spotted, he used the Force to toss Jiro and the others into the back of the cart. The vehicle reached the bottom of the hill and hit a [[tree/Legends|tree]], throwing Jiro and the others out of it.<ref name=\"DTFC3\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 3]]''</ref>\n\nAfter recovering from the crash, Jiro and the rest of the younglings followed Zao deeper into the forest. He hid with the group when they heard blaster fire. Jiro was present when the [[Yunu]] found the group of Jedi. The Arkinnea Militia caught up with the two groups and held them at gunpoint.<ref name=\"DTFC4\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 4]]''</ref> As the militia opened fire, Zao used to force to raise a boulder out of the ground to give them cover. Jiro fled with Piru and the other younglings but returned when the blasterfire subsided. After the battle, Jiro and the rest of the clan followed the Yunu deeper into the forest. He greeted K'Kruhk when he caught up with the rest of the group. Jiro settled into his [[Hidden Temple (Arkinnea)|new home]] and continued his training as a Jedi.<ref name=\"FC5\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Jiro}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Times: Parallels]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 1]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 2]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 3]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jiro\n|es=Jiro\n|nl=Jiro\n|pl=Jiro\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bogden residents]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Soaring Hawkbat Clan]]\n[[Category:Zabrak]]"}}}]}}}}
