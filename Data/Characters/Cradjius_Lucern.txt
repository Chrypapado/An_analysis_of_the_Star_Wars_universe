He took over from the former owner when his predecessor fled the [[Demophon system]]'s imminent [[Supernova/Legends|supernova]]. Lucern preyed on panicking citizens who gambled in the hopes of winning enough [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to flee the planet. Lucern had some connections with the [[G'uotr Network]], but at heart he was a loner. His connections were just enough to guarantee him passage with the Network off [[Demophon]] before the supernova. In return, he skimmed a portion of his profits for the Network, and allowed them to use Marqo's as a meeting place for their agents.<ref name=\"TC\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Supernova (WEG)|text=''Supernova''|story=Triple Cross}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lucern, Cradjius}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Demophonians]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
