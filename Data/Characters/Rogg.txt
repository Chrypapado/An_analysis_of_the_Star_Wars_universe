When [[Kyle Katarn]] and [[WeeGee]] attempted to escape from the [[Katarn family compound|Katarn homestead]] into [[Barons Hed]], the band of Tuskens [[Mission to Sulon|pursued]] them on [[Swoop/Legends|swoops]], though Rogg was [[Death/Legends|assassinated]] during the chase by [[Bordo]], his nominal second-in-command who was eager to usurp him as leader of the Grave Tuskens.\n\n==Biography==\nRogg<ref name=\"Rebel Agent\" /> was among the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] who admired [[KkH'Oar'Rrhr]] and abandoned their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] with [[Gender/Legends|him]] in search of [[Darth Krayt|A'Sharad Hett]], a Tusken-raised [[Human/Legends|Human]] who left the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] in disgrace after he was unmasked in a [[Duel on Tatooine (Imperial Period)|duel]] with [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], a severe trespass in Tusken culture. The band searched the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], from [[Portug]] to [[Dromund Kaas]], for Hett, but the searched ultimately proved futile, and the Tuskens were left destitute, hungry and discouraged. However, they were eventually found on Dromund Kaas by the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Maw (Dark Jedi)|Maw]], a minion of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], who organized Hoar's Tuskens into a [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gang]]. Transporting them to [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] to rob ancient [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] graves of [[The Force|Force]] artifacts, Maw dubbed them the [[Grave Tuskens]] and Hoar and his riders defiled their traditional Tusken masks, flaunting their bare faces to honor A'Sharad Hett. However, their thievery soon attracted a far more powerful, [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark-sider]]: the [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hand]], [[Arden Lyn]].<ref name=\"Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2\">{{SW|url=news/barely-tolerable-alien-henchmen-of-the-empire-part-2|text=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2|int=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire}}</ref> In [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]],<ref name=\"Rebel Agent\" /> after she interfered with one of Hoar's grave raids and defeated him in a duel, Lyn coerced Hoar into joining her mission to assassinate high-profile members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], and he abandoned the Grave Tuskens to Maw's whim without a second thought<ref name=\"Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2\" /> and Rogg succeeded him as the [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] gang's leader, with [[Bordo]] becoming his nominal second-in-command. However, after three [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of following Rogg's commands, Bordo became fed up with his leadership and became one of several Grave Tuskens eager to inherit his position.<ref name=\"Rebel Agent\" />\n\nIn [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]],<ref name=\"TERC\" /> Maw sent the Grave Tuskens to guard the [[Katarn family compound|Katarn homestead]] on [[Sulon]], where the Empire had stolen a [[Map to the Valley of the Jedi|map]] to the [[Valley of the Jedi]]. Rogg led the band of Tuskens in pursuing a [[T-4 (vehicle)|T-4]] carrying [[Kyle Katarn]], who had [[Mission to Sulon|infiltrated]] [[Katarn family|his family's]] to recover the map, and his [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[WeeGee]], who were trying to escape into the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] of [[Barons Hed]] after discovering that it had already been taken. During the chase, however, Bordo made his move to usurp Rogg and shot him in the face, [[Death/Legends|killing]] him and sending his swoop soaring into a canyon. Confident that his betrayal had gone unnoticed, Bordo then led the gang for the remainder of the pursuit, which ended with Bordo and most of the Grave Tuskens dead at the hands of Katarn.<ref name=\"Rebel Agent\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA male Tusken Raider,<ref name=\"Rebel Agent\" /> Rogg admired KkH'Oar'Rrhr and joined him in the search for A'Sharad Hett, even defiling his traditional Tusken mask and showing his face in Hett's honor, a severe trespass in Tusken culture.<ref name=\"Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2\" /> He enjoyed his position as leader of the Grave Tuskens and liked the power that it conveyed. However, he regarded the notion of leading from the front as impractical, as if he was killed, it would resulted in the loss of his valuable knowledge and experience, not to mention his life. He even opened the matter for discussion, hoping to convince the rest of his band that the traditional system was foolish, but was blocked by his nominal second-in-command Bordo, who regarded Rogg as a coward and wished to usurp his position as leader of the Grave Tuskens. At the [[Time/Legends|time]] of his death, Rogg wore a charm pouch around his neck with the belief that it would protect him.<ref name=\"Rebel Agent\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/barely-tolerable-alien-henchmen-of-the-empire-part-2|text=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2|int=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Tusken Raiders]]"}}}]}}}}
