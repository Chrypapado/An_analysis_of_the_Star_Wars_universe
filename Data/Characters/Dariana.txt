What you want is not important. What is best for you is not in your hands to decide. You are part of something much greater. We are Tarasin.|Dariana's mother to Dariana as a child|url=http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030102scenario}}\nAs the Mother of the [[Hiironi irstat]], the largest irstat on [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]], Mother '''Dariana''' was viewed as the wisest of all [[Tarasin]].<ref name=\"LFC\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nThough she dreamed of it as a child, being the Mother of the Hiironi, or spiritual leader (a rank bestowed to the eldest woman in the tribe), was not a task she wanted, at least not as early as she got it. She desired the role of Irstat-Kes, or chief of the tribe (a rank bestowed to the ''second'' eldest woman in the tribe), and she looked forward to taking on the role.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nBut the day after the previous Mother was killed by a [[kilassin]], when her sister [[Meirana]] became Mother, Meirana died of a strange disease, thrusting Dariana immediately into the position of Mother. Dariana tried her best in her new job, but she was prone to tantrum when her \"wisdom\" was not listened<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nDariana believed in using offworld technology in certain cases. She carried a blaster to deal with predators<ref name=\"LFC\" /> and recorded her memoirs on electronic media instead of relying solely on her people's oral tradition. She often worked for her own good as much as for the good of her irstat.\n\nDariana trained some of the young [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] members of the irstat in her people's ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], some of whom, such as [[Constanten (Tarasin)|Constanten]], went on to the [[Almas Academy]] to train to become [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].<ref name=\"AMA\">''[[A Mon Alone]]''</ref>\n\nTowards the end of her life, her skin could no longer shift colors, but she still stood tall and had an impressive stance with the traditional Mother robe. She rarely left the irstat, but was present at any important meetings between the Hiironi and offworlders: Knowing her death was approaching, she decided to committ herself more with life.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nAbout a year after the [[Trade Wars]] of [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], a trusted offworlder friend of the irstat (probably [[Nim'Ri]], [[Shayne Gerrare]] or [[Gerta Haman]]) came to Dariana asking for a suitable location for a sanctuary, and Dariana pointed them to [[Cloud Mountain]]. Soon afterward, a group of individuals looking for the people who had disappeared themselves to join the [[Cularin resistance]] came to the irstat following clues left by the missing people. Dariana sensed a disturbance to the balance of nature around Cloud Mountain, and pointed them in the same direction as she had the irstat's friend. At this point, the [[Metatheran Cartel]] was secretly cutting down [[ch'hala tree]]s and, although Dariana's friend knew it, he or she did not tell Dariana because the Tarasin would start a violent bloodshed.<ref name=\"TRW\">''[[The Resistance Within]]''</ref>\n\nLater, another of Dariana's sisters, [[Liriana]], turned up leading a group of Tarasin [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Witch/Legends|witches]] calling themselves the [[Wyrd]]. Dariana had had her own brush with the dark side when, as a child, she used it to kill a young kilassin before it could eat her.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[An Uneasy Peace]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Holes]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030102scenario|text=A Mother's Memoirs|int=A Mother's Memoirs|archivedate=20091016041022}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030206scenario|text=Friendship in the Order|int=Friendship in the Order|archivedate=20090603045501}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Padawannabes]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]''\n*''[[From the Trees]]''\n*[[Destruction (Living Force adventure)|''Destruction'']] {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Heart]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Eye]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20010913a_witch&c=swlfc|text=Liriana: Dark Force Witch of Cularin|int=Liriana: Dark Force Witch of Cularin|archivedate=20021001234947}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20021219winter|text=Winter Fantasy Preview|int=Winter Fantasy Preview|archivedate=20060913004808}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030703memories|text=Life's Memories|int=Life's Memories (article)|archivedate=20060908183352}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030918wyrd|text=News of the Wyrd|int=News of the Wyrd|archivedate=20060909202338}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040325wisdom|text=Home of Wisdom|int=Home of Wisdom (article)|archivedate=20090603045407}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040429memoirs|text=A Mother's Memoirs, Continued|int=A Mother's Memoirs, Continued|archivedate=20091016060254}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040812|text=Sacrifices|int=Sacrifices|archivedate=20080530004917}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20041021|text=View from the Roof|int=View from the Roof|archivedate=20091016031932}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20050113|text=Reprieves|int=Reprieves|archivedate=20091016023710}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20050413memoirs|text=A Mother's Memoirs, Concluded|int=A Mother's Memoirs, Concluded|archivedate=20090603045632}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]"}}}]}}}}
