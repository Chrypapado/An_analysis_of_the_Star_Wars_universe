She was the great-granddaughter of [[Pars Varqom]], a retired [[Palace Guard (Naboo)|Palace Guard]] for the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]]. Varqom served as a [[Pearl Hat]] for 18 years under seven [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|monarchs]], from [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ars Veruna/Legends|Ars Veruna]] to [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Mairayni]]. His memoirs, which mentioned Lesia, were recorded in the 2,453th volume of the [[Royal Archives of Naboo]].\n\nLesia deemed her great-grandfather \"old-fashioned\" due to his [[Anti-droid sentiment/Legends|anti-droid sentiment]] and boycott of products manufactured by [[Neimoidian/Legends|Neimoidians]], [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] or from corporations that aided both sides of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], such as [[Tagge Company]] and the ones based on [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]] and [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[Jason Fry]], writer of ''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'', eventually cut any mentioning of Lesia in the final product. The character was later made [[canon]]ical in the [[StarWars.com]] blog post [[Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut|''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'': Author's Cut, Part 6 &mdash; Showdown at Naboo'']]. For Varqom's story, Fry took inspiration from [[Wikipedia:World War II|World War II]] veterans he knew who swore to never buy cars made in [[Wikipedia:Japan|Japan]] after the conflict.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'' {{C|Cut}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-essential-guide-to-warfare-authors-cut-part-6-showdown-at-naboo|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'' Author's Cut, Part 6: Showdown at Naboo|int=Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lesia\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
