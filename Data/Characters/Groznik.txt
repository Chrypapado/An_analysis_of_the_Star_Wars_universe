[[Slavery/Legends|Enslaved]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] prior to the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], he swore a [[Life debt/Legends|life debt]] to [[Throm Loro]] after the freedom fighter liberated him and saved his life. The two developed a very close bond, and Groznik traveled with him to Cilpar in an attempt to free the [[Planet/Legends|world]] from Imperial rule. When Loro [[Death/Legends|died]] at the [[Battle of the Cliffs]], Groznik became distraught, but transferred his life debt to Throm's wife, [[Elscol Loro|Elscol]], and continued his work with the [[Cilpari Resistance]].\n\nWith the help of [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and his fellow Rogue [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]], Elscol Loro and Groznik led the resistance movement to success against [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Boren Tascl]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]. After Loro joined Rogue Squadron, Groznik accompanied her to Mrlsst to negotiate for [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] control of the [[Phantom Project]], a supposed [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]] for [[Starship/Legends|starships]].\n\nOn that planet, Groznik and Loro encountered what appeared to be the [[Force ghost]] of Throm Loro, which was in fact a [[Mrlssi Laser Phantoms|Mrlssi Laser Phantom]] controlled by weapon designer [[Rorax Falken]]. Falken used the phantom Loro to take control of Groznik and pit him against Rogue Squadron. When [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] killed Falken and the phantom Loro disappeared, the pain of once again losing his master pushed Groznik to ferociously attack the Imperials, allowing the Rogues to escape. Groznik sacrificed himself when he prevented Imperial officer [[Loka Hask]] from escaping [[Falken's Lab]] before it was destroyed by the [[gravitic polarization beam]], a [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] designed by Falken. Both Hask and Groznik were killed in the weapon's destruction.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and life debt to Throm Loro===\n{{Quote|When Throm's group struck the base, Groznik went crazy&hellip;started killing every stormtrooper in sight.|Elscol Loro|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition}}\n[[File:Groznikthrom.jpg|thumb|left|Groznik and Throm Loro fighting side by side]]\nGroznik, whose name meant \"furious jester\" in [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]],<ref name=\"GCG\">''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> was born on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], where he spent much of his early life swinging through the [[Wroshyr tree/Legends|trees]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] lush forests and playing stick and ball games with his fellow [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]]. Like many others of his [[Species/Legends|species]], however, he was captured and [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] shortly after the rise of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" /> His Imperial captors forced Groznik to load and unload heavy machinery and [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] onto supply [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttles]] at a military base on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]],<ref name=\"Handbook 1\">''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''</ref> where he was kept in chains and under the constant watchful eye of armed [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]].<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nSome time prior to the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the base was attacked and liberated by a group of freedom fighters who, though affiliated with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], received little Alliance assistance. Groznik seized upon the opportunity to punish his captors and started attacking wildly, smashing Imperials to [[Death/Legends|death]] with his fists, shackles, and whatever machinery he could get his hands on. He was nearly shot from behind by a stormtrooper and Imperial officer, but one of the fighters, [[Throm Loro]], gunned them down at the last minute and saved the Wookiee's life.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nGroznik was immediately grateful to his savior, embracing Loro in a powerful hug and pledging a [[Life debt/Legends|life debt]] to him. The two became fast friends and, due to the Wookiee's fierce loyalty, were inseparable. When Loro returned to his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] [[Cilpar]] with plans to liberate it from Imperial rule under [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Boren Tascl]] and [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Norquest]], Groznik went with him and helped orchestrate his resistance efforts.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nGroznik helped Loro form the [[Cilpari Resistance]], and Loro trusted his Wookiee companion with sensitive information others were not privy to, including the identity of [[Winter Celchu|Winter]], the Rebel agent who helped Loro coordinate his resistance forces. Thanks in part to Groznik's help, the Cilpari Resistance proved disruptive to the planet's Imperial forces. Tascl, who possessed superior firepower, responded with powerful and overwhelming military strikes.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\n===The death of Throm Loro===\n{{Quote|They finally got him at the Battle of the Cliffs. Groznik was devastated. No opportunity to repay the debt.|Elscol Loro|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition}}\n[[File:X-wing_01_21.jpg|thumb|right|Groznik watching Throm Loro die at the Battle of the Cliffs on Cilpar]]\nThe resistance suffered a major defeat in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]] at the [[Battle of the Cliffs]], a skirmish in the planet's mountainous region. The battle began as a fight against stormtroopers, but the Imperials were soon reinforced by two [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttles]], and the Cilpari Resistance had no [[Starship/Legends|ships]] or artillery with which to resist them. As Groznik and Loro fought side by side, Loro was shot in the back and killed by one of the shuttles.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nFurious, Groznik hurled a boulder at the craft as it passed, ripping the left wing apart and destroying the ship that had killed his master. The action turned the tide of the battle and allowed much of the resistance to escape, but Groznik wasn't even left with enough time for the traditional Wookiee period of mourning. Even destroying those who killed Loro provided him with no sense of closure, and Groznik was left suffering feelings of guilt and remorse, which would haunt him the rest of his life.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nLong before his death, Loro told Groznik about his wife, [[Elscol Loro]], and although the Wookiee had never met her, her connection to his old master was enough that the life debt transferred to Elscol. From that point on, he refused to ever leave her side and, as she continued to lead her late husband's resistance movement, Groznik fought alongside her. The Wookiee also assisted the movement in other ways, such as helping transport and maintain heavy weaponry and escorting vehicles through the planet's forests by swinging from tree to tree and using his sense of smell to detect traps.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\n[[File:Elscolgroznik2.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Groznik and Elscol Loro mourn the loss of Throm Loro together.]]\nDespite his strong sense of devotion to Elscol Loro, Groznik never felt as close to her as he had been to Throm, nor did he ever trust her completely like he did his deceased friend. Groznik never revealed to her secrets Loro shared with him, including the identity or whereabouts of Winter. Elscol respected Groznik's wishes and made no efforts to persuade Groznik to provide any privileged information.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nGroznik and Loro nevertheless cared deeply for each other and particularly bonded through their mutual sense of loss and despair over Throm. The two would occasionally seclude themselves from others to mourn together, weeping as they looked at [[Hologram/Legends|holograms]] of Throm and shared memories of him. During these sessions, Groznik became particularly protective of Loro and agitated whenever anyone tried to disturb them.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\n===The liberation of Cilpar===\n{{Quote|He can move faster and sense more outside the carrier. If somebody's set a trap, Groznik will take them out.|Elscol Loro|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition}}\nAbout one month after the Battle of Endor, Rebel [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and members of his elite [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] came to Cilpar on what began as a routine mission to escort a food [[Convoy/Legends|convoy]] bound for [[Mrlsst/Legends|Mrlsst]], another planet in the [[Colonies/Legends|Colonies Region]]. Groznik crept up on the Rogues, allowing Elscol Loro to disarm and capture them. Eventually, Antilles convinced Loro, Groznik, and the other resistance fighters that they were on the same side and agreed to help them [[Mission to Cilpar|eliminate the Imperial presence]] on Cilpar.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\n[[File:TasclCaptured-TRO4.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Groznik attacks and captures Moff Boren Tascl.]]\nGroznik quickly demonstrated his strength and usefulness to the Rogues when he helped defend them from an ambush by stormtroopers and an [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]] [[Pilot/Legends|piloted]] by Boren Tascl himself. Antilles agreed to allow Groznik to coordinate the defense for the makeshift Rogue Squadron base west of [[Kiidan]], the Cilpar [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]]. Groznik kept the base safe with the help of [[Dllr Nep]], the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] Rogue pilot who used his strong sense of hearing in conjunction with Groznik's strong sense of smell. During their long nights protecting the base together, Groznik and Nep became friends.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nWeeks later, after Tascl's forces captured Winter and veteran Rogue pilot [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]], Antilles planned an assault against the Moff's palace at Kiidan. During the battle, Loro discovered that [[Vance Rego]], a long-time member of the Cilpari Resistance, was a double-agent who had betrayed the resistance and Rebel forces to Tascl. Believing Groznik to have been killed by [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighter]] attacks, Rego attempted to kill Loro by hurling her from a moving [[Speeder truck/Legends|speeder truck]].<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nGroznik, however, evaded the TIE attacks and leaped onto the speeding vehicle. He attacked Rego and hurled the traitor away, then swung Loro to safety on a nearby vine. Presuming Rego to be dead, Loro and Groznik joined the assault on the Imperial palace, where the Wookiee personally found and attacked Tascl. Bent on avenging Throm Loro's death, Groznik was about to snap the Moff's neck when he was stopped by Elscol, who insisted Tascl should stand trial.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\n===Rogue Squadron and Mrlsst===\n{{Quote|The hard part was listening to the Wookiee. He jumped out of his fur seeing Elscol join you in that attack.|Wes Janson|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Phantom Affair}}\n[[File:Elscolgroznik1.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Groznik and Elscol Loro on Mrlsst]]\nFollowing the success of the Cilpari Resistance movement, Elscol Loro accepted an invitation by Antilles to join Rogue Squadron. Satisfied that Throm's legacy had been fulfilled through the liberation of the planet, Groznik insisted upon following Elscol and the Rogues to Mrlsst about one month later. The [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] was dispatched to the planet to negotiate with the [[Mrlssi]] for control of the [[Phantom Project]], an apparent [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]] for [[Realspace/Legends|space]] vehicles that required very little energy to operate.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\nWhenever Loro participated in Rogue missions, Groznik was tasked mainly with guarding Wes Janson, who broke his leg on Mrlsst and was confined to a [[power chair]]. Other than this task, Groznik had no official capacity with Rogue Squadron and instead continued to watch over Loro; Janson affectionately complained that when Groznik watched him, the Wookiee spent more time worrying about Loro than guarding him.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\nDuring a visit with Janson at the [[Mrlssi]] [[Central Academic Hospital]], Imperial stormtroopers attempted to arrest Groznik, along with Rogue Squadron pilots Loro, Janson, Dllr Nep, [[Tycho Celchu]], [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo|Plourr Ilo]], and [[Derek Klivian/Legends|Derek Klivian]]&mdash;and local allies [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Terrik]] and [[Koyi Komad]]&mdash;under false charges that Celchu stole the Phantom Project [[Datacard/Legends|datacards]]. Groznik was instrumental in helping the group escape, tossing stormtroopers through [[Transparisteel/Legends|transparisteel]] [[Window/Legends|windows]] and charging through dozens of enemies in order to create an escape path. Komad led the group into hiding in the planet's underground controlled by the [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Nasta]].<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\n===Phantom Throm Loro and Groznik's death===\n{{Quote|Are you dead, beast? Are you finally done?!|Loka Hask|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Phantom Affair}}\n[[File:Groznikandghost.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Groznik and Elscol Loro are confronted by a Mrlssi Laser Phantom of Throm Loro.]]\nLoro and Groznik stayed behind while the other Rogues pursued a lead they believed could lead to recovering the stolen datacards. Shortly after the Rogues left, the duo were confronted by what appeared to be the [[Force ghost]] of Throm Loro. Groznik was entranced and delighted at the thought that his old master had returned, and in his happiness, he failed to question whether the apparition might be a fake, even though Throm Loro had never been a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. When Throm ordered Groznik to knock Elscol out, he did so without question or hesitation.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\nIn fact, the Throm Loro image was a [[Mrlssi Laser Phantoms|Mrlssi Laser Phantom]], a sophisticated hologram developed by [[Professor/Legends|Professor]] [[Rorax Falken]]. Falken, a renowned [[Scientist/Legends|physicist]], had developed the plans for the fake Phantom Project as a way to swindle [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance. At the phantom Throm's orders, Groznik flew a ship to [[Falken's Lab]], which had been built into one of the many [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroids]] in a [[Asteroid belt|field]] [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] Mrlsst.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\nAlthough Falken held Nep and Terrik hostage and spoke frankly about his deceptions in front of Groznik, the Wookiee was so desperate to continue believing Throm was alive that he blindly served both Falken and the phantom. When [[Loka Hask]] and his Imperial stormtroopers raided the lab in search of the datacards, Groznik fought them alongside the Throm image. The Wookiee reveled in the chance to fight alongside and once again protect his master.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\n[[File:ElscolLoroAndGroznik.png|thumb|left|Groznik and Elscol Loro, who took over the life debt after her husband Throm died]]\nHis happy delusions were short-lived, however, ending when Falken was gunned down, causing all his Mrlssi Laser Phantoms to disappear. Groznik watched in horror as Throm Loro disappeared before his eyes, and the feelings that he once again failed to save the life of his master caused Groznik to lose control of himself. The Wookiee attacked the stormtroopers with his hands, taking on dozens at a time and beating them to death as his Rogue friends escaped the lab in Mirax Terrik's ''[[Pulsar Skate]]''.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\nOnly after all the stormtroopers were dead did Groznik himself collapse, falling on a pile of dead Imperial soldiers. Hask, falsely believing the Wookiee to be dead, explored the lab and discovered the [[gravitic polarization beam]], a molecular weapon that disrupted matter on an atomic level. The weapon, developed in secret by Falken, was capable of destroying an entire planet.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\nHowever, Antilles and the other Rogue activated the [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] via remote in order to destroy the lab and the weapon itself, to prevent it from falling into Imperial hands. Hask attempted to flee to his shuttle, where he planned to jump into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], but the revived Groznik grabbed his ankle and successfully blocked his escape. The [[Gravity/Legends|gravitic]] polarization beam fired and created a [[hyperspace wormhole]], destroying Groznik, Hask, his [[Interdictor-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Interdictor Star Destroyer]] [[Dominator (Interdictor-class)|''Dominator'']] and Falken's Lab along with it.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Groznik's just a jump away.|Elscol Loro|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition}}\nGroznik's death weighed heavily on Elscol Loro, who was still in mourning for the recent loss of her husband.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" /><ref name=\"Battleground: Tatooine\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine]]''</ref> The Mrlssti considered Groznik a hero of the Rebellion and erected a memorial statue of the Wookiee on the [[Mrlsst Trade and Science Academy]] campus.<ref name=\"Handbook 1\" /> Although never attaining the fame or status of the Wookiee [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], Groznik became well known for his association with the famed Rogue Squadron and his actions at Mrlsst. This was demonstrated by [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]; as he mourned the death of Chewbacca, more than two decades after Groznik's death, Solo recalled to himself the stories of Groznik and his devotion to Throm and Elscol Loro.<ref name=\"Hero's Trial\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|He brought that fighter down with a stick!|Wedge Antilles|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition}}\nGroznik had light-[[brown]] fur with a dark-brown streak stretching down the center of his face, from the top of his head to his chin. He often wore [[Green (disambiguation)|green]], [[gray]], or brown shoulder straps with pouches and utility pockets. Although he frequently carried and was proficient with a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]], Groznik preferred hand-to-hand combat due to his enormous strength. He often proved himself capable of extraordinary feats in battle, including instances in which he destroyed a TIE Fighter by smashing it with part of a tree, and a ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle by throwing a boulder at it.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\n[[File:Throm.jpg|thumb|right|Groznik embraces Throm Loro. The Wookiee never fully recovered from the grief or guilt following Loro's death.]]\nDue to his Kashyyyk upbringing, Groznik was able to swing and leap from trees and other large distances at great ease, even with enough speed to keep up with [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeders]], and felt far less comfortable when confined to the small area of slower-moving vehicles. Groznik was a proficient pilot and [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]], and he could move stealthily in outdoor settings. He also possessed a strong sense of smell that made him an excellent [[Scout/Legends|scout]] and guard.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nGroznik had a fiery temper due in part to the tragedies that so defined his early life. His kidnapping, captivity, and cruel treatment at the hands of Imperials made Groznik prone to snapping when pushed too hard. In particular, the death of Throm Loro had a profound negative effect on Groznik from which he never fully recovered, instilling in him a sadness that would never fade and making him become closed off and distant from most other beings, even occasionally Elscol Loro.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nLike many Wookiees, Groznik had a strong sense of loyalty and took the concept of the life debt very seriously. His loyalty to Throm was unmatched, and he never stopped blaming himself for his master's death. His sense of loss was so strong that he easily allowed himself to believe Rorax Falken's Mrlssi Laser Phantom vision of Throm Loro was the resurrected spirit of his master, even in the face of strong evidence to the contrary.<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|I hated it the second I saw it because it was a retread of the Han Solo/Chewie story.
