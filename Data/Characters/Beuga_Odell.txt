Surveillance holographs had her appear as a sweet-natured old women, but anyone familiar with the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] underworld knew she was deadly serious about dominating the gambling, [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]], and narcotic trades. Odell butted heads with the [[Quetemoor crime family]] for decades, dating back to to [[Quetemoor the Venerable]]'s days as head [[Mugaari]]. Her organization soon became large as Quetemoor's, but both gangs were dwarfed by the galaxy-spanning specter of [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]. Beuga Odell took comfort in the fact that Black Sun was too large to take an active interest in her operations, and she kept Black Sun envoy [[Mal Coramma]] at bay with regular bribes. She dearly loved to wipe out the much smaller organization of [[The Wolfman]] [[Volven Roxe]], but feared that doing so would trigger a gang war.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Odell, Beuga}}\n[[Category:Black Sun members]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
