Col.]] [[Wilfred Quelsh]] in [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]].<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Quelsh's [[Corellian Medal of Honor]] was stolen and Yamagh helped with the search. When Quelsh asked an independent agent to help in the investigation of the theft, Yamagh pointed the [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to a group of local thugs known as [[Braggan's Fist]]. The agent managed to successfully solve the case of the stolen medal and found proof that Quelsh had framed former CorSec officer [[Kal Braggan]] for a crime that Quelsh had committed and that he had later murdered Braggan. Yamagh was left speechless by Quelsh's crimes, as he had always considered it an honor to work for a highly decorated officer like Quelsh.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEdbr Yamagh was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref> He could be found in the city of Tyrena on Corellia.
