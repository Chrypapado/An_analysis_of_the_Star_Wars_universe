Shi Bata joined the Corellian resistance and went undercover as a medic in the [[Caicos Droid Factory]], now a makeshift hospital. He was contacted by [[Nevis Kitt]] and was asked to get the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Voidhound]] inside the heavily guarded factory. Shi Bata accomplished that by simply shooting the smuggler in a leg and bringing him in with the wounded, then patching it up while inside.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bata, Shi}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Healers and doctors]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
