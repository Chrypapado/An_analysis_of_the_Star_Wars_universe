Following in the footsteps of his forefathers, most likely his grandfather who had been captured by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]], he became a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] prior to the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], but was a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] in his younger days.\n\n==Biography==\nRoss once had a relationship with [[Saahir Ru'luv]], which Ru'luv ultimately ended after three years. During a smuggling mission for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] on [[Merich's Bend]] that was uncovered by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] agents, Saahir died in Thaddeus's arms. Thaddeus's shipboard computer, came to fill the void in Thaddeus's life left by his lover, after it developed its own personality, forming something akin to a mother-son relationship with the smuggler.\n\nAt some point, while on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], he saved a [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] from two [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]], picking up a 5,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] bounty for his capture.\n\nWhile on [[Najiba/Legends|Najiba]], after speaking with [[Reuther]], Thaddeus met [[Adalric Cessius Brandl]] and agreed to give him passage to [[Trulalis]] for 8,000 credits. While there Thaddeus was briefly strangled by Adalric after shooting at him and as a result mistook him for a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. They were later ambushed on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] by [[Menges]], and above Trulalis, ''Kierra'' was captured by a [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]]. Thaddeus was subjected to interrogation by Captain [[Grendahl]], but was eventually released.\n\nWhile on his way out of the Star Destroyer, Thaddeus spoke with Adalric, who paid him for the rest of the work he did and informed him that the bounty had been called off. Thaddeus then realized that Adalric was carrying a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] and quickly ran to the ''Kierra'' barely escaping before Adalric set off the detonator in an attempt to hide his family.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|4|The Final Exit}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=The Final Exit}}\n*{{Journal|15|Laughter After Dark (short story)|Laughter After Dark}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|13|Alien Encounters (article series)|Alien Encounters}}\n*''[[The Black Sands of Socorro]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Thaddeus Ross\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ross, Thaddeus}}\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
