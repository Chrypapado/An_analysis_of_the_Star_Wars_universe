By the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Mepou was an old man and a very disillusioned Meatlump.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP5\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the old Meatlump was smashing some [[Power generator/Legends|generators]] in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]] to please his lieutenant, [[Kaiya Merel]], when he encountered a spacer. The spacer was working for [[Vani Korr]], a ''[[Corellia Times]]'' [[Journalist/Legends|reporter]] who was investigating the Meatlumps. Mepou confessed he could not retire from being a Meatlump unless a new person take his place. The spacer, who wanted to infiltrate the Meatlumps, accepted to replace Alliin and the old man finally retired. The spacer moved to work for Kaiya Merel while Alliin Mepou planned to go find some seashells on the beach, or jut sleep all day and watch [[Holovid/Legends|holovids]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP5\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlliin Mepou appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP5\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Alliin Mepou was added to the game with the update dubbed \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 10|Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King]]\", released on [[June 19]], [[2008]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67812&month=062008|text=Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King|archivedate=20110924005831}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Meatlumps Hideout}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mepou, Alliin}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Meatlumps]]"}}}]}}}}
