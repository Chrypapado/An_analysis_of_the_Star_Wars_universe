Trust me!|Danielle Kieran|Polyhedron 94}}\n'''Danielle Kieran''', known to her friends as '''Dani''', was a hot-shot [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], who believed herself to be [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo's]] illegitimate daughter.\n\n==Biography==\nGrowing up without a father, the young Dani discovered that her mother had been close with the young [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and she became quietly convinced that she had found the truth about her parentage. All [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] looked and acted somewhat alike, and Dani deliberately imitated her supposed father's style of dress and behavior; but the strange sense of recognition strangers sometimes felt when they encountered her may have hinted that there was something more than self-belief and hero-worship behind her posturing.\n\nAs soon as she was old enough, Dani borrowed money from [[Talon Karrde]] to buy herself a [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300]] freighter of her own, the ''[[Century Hawk]]''. By the time she was seventeen, she was flying her ship out of [[Crystal Web Station]], looking for a chance to prove herself as a pilot. Although she had told no-one of her suspicions about her parentage, she wanted to be a daughter Han Solo would be proud of. To this end, she had planned to fly the [[Kessel Run/Legends|Kessel Run]], not to beat Solo's time (as that would be impossible as far as she was concerned) but to prove herself as his daughter.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDani Kieran is one of a number of characters introduced in articles in the RPG magazine ''[[Polyhedron]]'' in the 1990s, co-written by [[Bill Slavicsek]] of [[West End Games]] and intended to be used in conjunction with the official material. Although their canonical status is ambiguous, these pieces are regarded as more reliable than other apocrypha, and material originating in them has reappeared in more recent canon sources&mdash;such as [[Merili]] and the [[Church of the Dark Side]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{PolyhedronCite|94|The Luminous Bantha: Adventures for the Star Wars: New Republic Campaign}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kieran, Danielle}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:House of Solo]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
