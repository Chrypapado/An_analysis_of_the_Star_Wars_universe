He was also part of Alderaan's resistance movement.\n\n==Biography==\nBail Organa sent Dalhney, accompanied by [[Winter Celchu|Winter]] (posing as his daughter) and [[Ylenic It'kla]] to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]] to meet with representatives from three anti-Imperial resistance groups; [[Bria Tharen]] and [[Jace Paol]] from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], [[Jenssar SoBilles]] from [[Duro/Legends|Duro]] and [[Sian Tevv/Legends|Sian Tevv]] from [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]]. The [[Corellian Resistance/Legends|Corellian Resistance]] was attempting to gather support for unifying the resistance groups together in order to better fight the Empire. However, Dalhney was unwilling to go against Alderaan's non-violent culture by committing forces to open rebellion, though he did agree to support the Corellians where possible.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBy [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], Dalhney was an older man who sported greying [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and a beard. In keeping with the traditional values of his people, the minister agreed that the Empire should be stopped, but he refused to involve Alderaanians into actual acts of violence.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHric Dalhney first appeared in ''[[Rebel Dawn]]'', a novel by [[A.
