In [[3956 BBY]] Demknot was involved in a confrontation with [[Helena Shan]] at [[Junix's Joint]]. He was annoyed by Helena's attitude of superiority and left the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]]. On his way home, he met the amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and his companions as they entered the city from the docking bay. He asked Revan if all [[Human/Legends|Humans]] placed themselves on \"high pedestals,\" referring to Helena's sense of superiority. He further speculated that \"Helena\" was the [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] word for \"pit [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]].\" When the party, which included [[Bastila Shan]], Helena's daughter, told him that they were looking for Helena, Demknot stated that he thought that all Humans were out of their minds, if they wanted to look for someone like Helena. He then returned home, still frustrated.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Maana Demknot\n|pl=Maana Demknot\n|ru=\u041c\u0430\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0442\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demknot, Maana}}\n[[Category:Duros]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
