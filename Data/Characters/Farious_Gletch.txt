You just keep removing these obstacles for me and your future will be prosperous.|Farious Gletch|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Farious Gletch''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] criminal who resided in a humble abode in the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Repaying a debt===\n{{Quote|Let's see what you're made of, pal. A Rodian thief that goes by the name Greenfinger is trying to skip town without paying his debts to me. That ain't acceptable. I need you to track this loser down and make an example of him. You can keep whatever he's carrying as a tip. Just make sure his passing is violent and painful.|Farious Gletch to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nSometime following [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] by the name of Farious Gletch resided in a humble abode in the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. During his [[Time/Legends|time]] in Bestine, a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Thief/Legends|thief]] by the name of [[Greenfinger]] attempted to skip town without paying his debt to Gletch.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nGletch considered this to be an unacceptable turn of events, and urged a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] he had encountered with tracking down Greenfinger and [[Death/Legends|killing]] him in the most violent and [[Torture/Legends|painful]] fashion. To further entice the spacer, Gletch granted permission to keep whatever Greenfinger's had on him as a tip. Gletch knew that this job required a \"strong [[Stomach/Legends|stomach]]\" and \"nerves of [[Durasteel/Legends|durasteel]],\" but the spacer was not the squeamish type, and agreed to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] the rogue Rodian. Greenfinger, who was not far outside of Bestine, was eventually located by the spacer and successfully killed after a brief [[Lightfight|firefight]]. Gletch, who had initially misjudged the spacer, was pleased by these turn of events and presented an award of 2,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Asserting dominance===\n{{Quote|The brute's an Aqualish named Gordul Koga. He's one mean gundark so start blasting as soon as you see him. You'll do it, right?|Farious Gletch to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nHowever, Gletch's woes did not end with Greenfinger's insubordination. An [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] enforcer by the name of [[Gordul Koga]] grew tired of working for Gletch, and left to pursue business for himself. Gletch did not take kindly to Koga's independence, and instructed the spacer to remind Koga that without him, he had no future. The spacer, once again willing to serve as a new enforcer for the likes of Gletch, successfully tracked down Koga within the expansive [[Desert/Legends|desert]] surrounding Bestine, and defeated him and his two other cronies in a small battle. Gletch, taking a new liking to the spacer, awarded yet an additional 3,000 credits for eliminating the ruthless Aqualish.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Illegal merchandise===\n[[File:EugeneTalmont.png|150px|thumb|Farious Gletch was determined to prevent Professor Whisper from assassinating the Imperial Prefect.]]\n{{Quote|Here's the deal: I bought some, uh, merchandise from a dumb thug named Ripper. I paid fair market price, but now he's tryin' to twist my arm for more credits. I need you to make this problem go away. Ripper's a known gangster and responsible for many deaths, so you can consider this a public service.|Farious Gletch to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring his time on the desert world of Tatooine, Gletch purchased illegal [[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]] from a [[Swooper/Legends|swooper]] working for [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], a Human named [[Ripper (Human)|Ripper]].<ref name=\"AED\" /> Glitterstim, a potent variety of spice [[Mining/Legends|mined]] on [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]], gave its users a brief, yet pleasurable [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathic]] boost and heightened mental state.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Jedi Academy Trilogy: Jedi Search\">''[[Jedi Search]]''</ref> Gletch claimed to have paid a fair market price for the \"merchandise,\" but insisted that Ripper was attempting to twist his [[Limb/Legends|arm]] for more credits. To make this problem go away, he urged the spacer to kill this man as well. To put a positive spin on the job, Gletch pointed out that removing a known gangster responsible for many deaths could be considered a public service. The spacer once agreed to enforce Gletch's wishes, [[Hunting/Legends|hunted]] down Ripper in the surrounding region, and killed him and his two fellow associates in [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire]]. However, before Ripper fell at the end of the spacer's weapon, he angrily shouted that Gletch had cheated him, and did not pay a single a single credit for the contraband. When the spacer returned to Gletch to report the news, he simply laughed at Ripper's fate, and dismissed any assertions he may have made about not paying for the glitterstim. While handing over a 4,0000 credit award, Gletch rhetorically asked the spacer if \"he really looked like the kind of guy who would cheat someone.\" Before the spacer could answer, however, Farious had second thoughts, and said not to answer that.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n===Assassinating the Prefect===\n{{Quote|You gotta stop a maniac from trying to bump off the Imperial Prefect! This killer is under the delusion that I've hired him! You gotta stop this madman before he gets us all killed! The Empire's revenge will be swift and brutal if they think I..we had anything to do with this!|Farious Gletch to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter the assassination of Ripper, Gletch and his loyal associate went about their own business for a while. Yet this break was cut short when Gletch learned of some terrifying news. A [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] assassin who went by the name of [[Professor/Legends|Professor]] [[Whisper (Bith)|Whisper]] was setting out on a mission to eliminate the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Prefect]], [[Eugene Talmont]]. Talmont, who held considerable sway over the governing of Tatooine, at that time held office in the nearby [[Bestine Capitol]] building alongside the likes of [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Tour Aryon]] and other influential officials. Gletch frantically informed the spacer that Whisper was under the false delusion that he had hired him to kill the Prefect. Gletch attributed this misunderstanding to a passing comment he made to someone in the street, that Bestine would be better off without the Prefect. Gletch insisted that the Bith's overly-acute [[Ear/Legends|hearing]], inability to take a joke, and downright insanity were what led him to embark on this mission. Gletch was no fool, for even he knew that an attempt on the life of an important Imperial [[Politics/Legends|political]] figure would be met with swift and brutal punishment from the Galactic Empire. The spacer, understanding the major implications, immediately sought out to kill the allegedly insane \"Professor.\" Before Whisper could make his way to the Bestine Capitol, Gletch's loyal enforcer confronted the Bith, preparing for a fight. Before the deadly skirmish began, Whisper insisted that he was a professional, and that Gletch could have simply contacted him if he wanted the contract terminated. However, it was too late to turn back, for Professor Whisper declared that both Gletch and his newfound enforcer now had to die. Despite Gletch's insistence that Whisper was a deadly, insane assassin, the Bith was ultimately defeated at the hands of the spacer's superior combat ability. With Whisper dead, and the plot to kill Prefect Talmont foiled, the spacer returned to Gletch to deliver the good news. Gletch, greatly relieved, awarded the spacer with a record sum of 6,000 credits, and suggested that the two of them part ways for the time being. Gletch, he said, was in dire need of a vacation.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Ha, ha! I would love to have seen the look on old Ripper's face when you introduced him to some blaster bolts! Oh, and if he claimed I never paid him, he lied. Do I look like the kinda guy that would try and cheat someone?
