Unlike most Jedi of the era, Joo held a position in a local government, becoming the elected [[Governor/Legends|governor]] of the city of [[Forard]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn to [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] parents on the world of [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], even as a child Klis Joo demonstrated a general aptitude in the use of technology that was common to her species. During her very early years of childhood, Joo was identified to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and sent to the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. At the [[Jedi academy|Temple academy]], Joo befriended fellow [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Initiate]] [[Nerra Ziveri]], and the pair eventually [[Jedi Initiate Trials|graduated]] the academy and were selected as [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] by two [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]. Under her tutor, Joo traveled [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], learning to temper her emotions and using her persistent nature to eventually pass the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]]. Made a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Knight of the Republic]] by the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]], Joo went onto to pursue individual studies in the ways of the [[Jedi Consular]].<ref name=\"g\" />\n\nTraveling around the galaxy on solo missions for the High Council, Joo returned to her homeworld in an attempt to learn more about her people's struggles and aid them in whatever way she could. However, it wasn't long before Joo became uncomfortable when confronted with her people's deference and she soon returned to Coruscant. Around this time, Joo met [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] mechanic [[Bran Isken]], appreciating his skills and commending him for aiding a Duros couple in need.<ref name=\"g\" /> After working out of Coruscant for a time, Joo's old friend and peer Master Ziveri invited the Duros to teach at the experimental [[Almas Academy|academy]] on [[Almas]]. Accepting the invitation, Joo arrived in [[53 BBY/Legends|53 BBY]] only to find that Ziveri had mysteriously left the academy. Again growing uncomfortable with her situation, Joo found teaching dull and often grew impatient with her students.<ref name=\"g\" />\n\nMaking frequent visits to the nearby settlement of [[Forard]], a small town servicing the academy's needs, Joo quickly accepted the office of [[Governor/Legends|governor]] when the position was left vacant after her predecessor passed away. Striving to improve conditions in the small town, Joo raised funding to expand and upgrade the local [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]], bring the facility up to high standards with twenty berthing bays. To fill the empty position of mechanic magister, Joo contacted her old friend Bran Isken, offering him the job which he accepted.<ref name=\"g\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nShort for a Duros, Klis Joo was more hot-tempered then most Jedi, something that her teachers frowned upon during her time at the Coruscant academy. One of Joo's biggest pet-peeves was being mistake for a [[Neimoidian/Legends|Neimoidian]] like so many of her species. Embracing her knack for technological study, Joo often tinkered with ships at the Temple, at one point taking up a hobby of preparing a racing ship in the [[Eskaron]] Games. When Joo took up public office on Almas, something discouraged by the High Council on Coruscant, the Duros fell out of practice in listening to the Force for guidance, relying on other judgments to help her decisions.<ref name=\"g\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Desert Cries]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Klis Joo#legends\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joo, Klis}}\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Duros]]\n[[Category:Educators]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jedi Consulars]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
