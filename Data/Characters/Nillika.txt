He worked as an administrator in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].\n\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]] many people were caught in a firefight between between [[Valarian/Legends|Lady Valarian's]] guards and [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt's]] thugs in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. The [[2-1B surgical droid|2-1B droid]] [[Billingsly]] sent a spacer to Mos Eisley to help the local medical staff. The droid also sent the medic's profile and payment to Nillika. After the medic had treated the injuries of [[Escara Frei]] and [[Jorund Redd]], Nillika handed out 5000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and a [[field surgeon ring]] to the medic.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAdministrator Nillika was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CitC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Administrator Nillika was added to the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\nAdministrator Nillika was part of the low-level quest \"[[W:c:swg:Caught in the Crossfire|Caught in the Crossfire]]\" for players of the [[W:c:swg:|Medic profession]].
