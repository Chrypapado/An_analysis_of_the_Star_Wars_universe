He was a playful, mischievous being, with scruffy, white [[Hair/Legends|fur]] and two large upper [[Tooth/Legends|incisors]]. As his species had an accelerated metabolism, he could move extraordinarily fast and was often seen as a blur. Teek was the only companion of a stranded [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Scout/Legends|scout]] by the name of [[Noa Briqualon]], with whom he shared a [[Noa Briqualon's hut|cabin]] on Endor. Briqualon spent most of his [[Time/Legends|time]] attempting to repair his damaged [[Noa Briqualon's starship|starship]] and was generally hostile toward outsiders who stumbled upon his home. The two lived together in isolation for [[Standard year/Legends|years]], with little or no interaction with other [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] beings.\n\nHowever, in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], a Human girl named [[Cindel Towani]] and her [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] companion, [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]], stumbled upon the house of Teek and Briqualon, who eventually formed a close bond with the two children. Several days after their first encounter, Towani was kidnapped by the [[Sanyassan]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] [[Terak]], and Teek and his friend aided Warrick in her rescue. Teek proved vital to the recovery, using his superior speed to great effect, and after they rescued Towani, he helped [[Battle of Endor (Ewok\u2013Sanyassan conflict)|fight]] Terak's warriors in the woods. Teek saved his companion's life when he attacked Terak, who was ready to strike the helpless Briqualon with his [[Sword/Legends|sword]]. Warrick then finished off the Sanyassan warlord. Teek was ultimately left behind when Briqualon and Towani departed on the [[Starship/Legends|starship]], which the old Human had finally repaired, although he found a home with the Ewoks of [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]], many of whom had aided him in the skirmish with the Sanyassans.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Teek2.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Teek using his amazing speed]]\nTeek was a member of the [[Species/Legends|species]] of the [[Teek (species)/Legends|same name]], born on the [[Tree/Legends|forest]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] some [[Time/Legends|time]] before the rise of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"DB\" /> Teek eventually became the companion of [[Noa Briqualon]], an old [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], who had been stranded on the moon ever since [[Noa Briqualon's starship|his starship]] crashed there. The two lived together in a small [[Noa Briqualon's hut|cabin]], near where Briqualon's [[Starship/Legends|starship]] lay. Briqualon was extremely reluctant to speak with other people on the moon and spent most of his time working on fixing his ship. Teek, however, opted to stay away from the ship and usually spent his time perched in trees as Briqualon worked relentlessly to restore function to his vessel.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\n===Wicket and Cindel===\n{{Quote|What's that?''\"<br />\"''Trouble!|Cindel Towani and Wicket on the arrival of Teek|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]],<ref name=\"Behind the Magic\">''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''</ref> Teek stumbled upon two lost companions in the woods: a female Human [[Youngling/Legends|child]] named [[Cindel Towani]], and an [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] named [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]]. The two had been captured by a [[Sanyassan]] [[Sanyassan Marauders|Marauder]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] named [[Terak]] but had managed to escape. However, the Sanyassans were determined to find Towani, thinking that she would help them unlock the secret of a piece of technology they had stolen during an [[Raid on Bright Tree Village|attack]] on her village, an assault that [[Death/Legends|killed]] her [[Towani family|family]]. Despite Warrick's apprehension, Towani decided to follow Teek, finding him amusing and hoping that he would lead them to shelter and food. Teek led them to Briqualon's cabin, where the two children, mistakenly assuming the house to be unoccupied, decided to stay. However, when Briqualon returned home, he was furious at his friend for allowing strangers into the house, and demanded that the children leave. Towani and Warrick made camp nearby, and Teek brought them [[Muffin|food]]. The old scout eventually had a change of [[Heart/Legends|heart]] and allowed Towani and Warrick to stay for one night only. Despite Towani's fragile mental state, he maintained that they would have to leave come morning, and a disappointed Teek accepted the decision.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\n[[File:Teek1lookattherest.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Teek meets Wicket W. Warrick and Cindel Towani.]]\nAlthough the children accepted Briqualon's terms and left in the morning, Briqualon reconsidered and allowed Warrick and Towani to stay with him and Teek as long as they proved themselves useful and helped out around the cabin. The next day, curious as to where Briqualon continued to disappear, the two guests followed the bearded Human as he set off to work on the starship, despite Teek's best efforts to dissuade them. Briqualon discovered them, told them his story, and allowed them to stay in his house as long as they needed. However, in the early [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] of the morning, Towani was kidnapped by the<ref name=\"Ewoks\" /> [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]]<ref name=\"Nightsister\">''[[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe]]''</ref> [[Charal]], and after searching the surrounding forests, Warrick and Briqualon left to rescue the young girl. Teek, though apprehensive at first, eventually sped off to assist them.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\n===Terak's Keep===\nThe trio arrived at [[Terak's Keep]], where Terak was holding Towani. When they reached the moat around the huge building, they opted not to swim across, as the [[Water/Legends|waters]] were infested with vicious beings. Instead they used Briqualon's [[Grappling hook/Legends|grappling hook]] to climb atop the great wall, where Teek and Warrick incapacitated the [[Unidentified eyepatched Sanyassan|patrolling guard]] and helped the larger Briqualon up onto the wall. The three of them searched the castle for Towani and discovered she was [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]], along with a group of Ewoks, in a nearby [[Prison/Legends|cell]]. However, Terak's men heavily guarded Towani's cell, and Teek and his friends could not pass the guards undetected. Teek, though, stole a guard's uniform, which the trio used to disguise themselves. They reached the dungeon where Towani was being kept, though two additional Sanyassans, playing cards, sat close to Towani. Teek slipped one of the men's cards into the Sanyassan's sleeve; when the other player noticed, a fight ensued, leaving the two Sanyassans dead and Teek with the keys needed to free Towani and the Ewoks.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\nWith the Ewoks freed, Teek and a group of rescued prisoners made their way back out of the Keep. However, Terak heard them escaping and sounded the alarms. Teek and the others eventually reached a dead end, but Briqualon used some explosives to blow a hole in the wall. The Sanyassans, led by Terak himself, soon reached the group, who were swinging across the moat on Briqualon's rope one by one. As Briqualon and Towani left, the young girl spotted a [[crystal oscillator]], the only remaining part Briqualon needed to get his ship running; the old man took it. Although the guards fired at them, Teek, Briqualon, Towani and the Ewoks escaped. However, Terak sent dozens of his men after the group.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\n[[File:TeekAccost.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Teek attacks Terak.]]\nThe escapees reached a forest, although Terak's [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], aided by Charal, tracked them. Briqualon led them to his ship, but it would take him several [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]] to power up the vessel. Teek was sent to scout the area and to discover how far away the Sanyassans were, while the Ewoks assembled a powerful [[Catapult/Legends|catapult]] near the ship. Teek found Terak's men; however, he inadvertently led them back to Briqualon's ship. The Sanyassans clashed with the Ewoks in the forest, and although Teek did not join the effort against Terak's warriors, he dealt the warlord a blow when he rubbed two stones together. The resulting flames caused Terak's two massive [[Blurrg/Legends|blurrg]] beasts to retreat.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\nTeek took control of one of the cannons on Briqualon's starship and fired back at the marauders. Through the efforts of Teek and his companions, Terak's warriors were driven back to the Keep, although the warlord himself remained to fight with Briqualon. Teek, perched high in a tree, watched in horror as Terak stood over a helpless Briqualon with his [[Sword/Legends|sword]] raised. However, the furry creature intervened and saved the life of his companion by jumping on Terak's head, unbalancing the Sanyassan. Through the efforts of Teek and Warrick, who inadvertently unlocked the dark magic in the warlord's ring, Terak was turned to stone.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\n===Goodbyes===\n{{Quote|I love you and I will miss you.|Noa Briqualon says goodbye to Teek|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor}}\n[[File:Teek_and_wicket.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Teek and Warrick wave goodbye to Towani and Briqualon.]]\nWith Terak defeated, Towani and Briqualon decided to leave Endor, although Teek opted to stay behind and live with the Ewoks. Briqualon said his emotional goodbyes to Teek, who was saddened that he would not see his companion again. Teek was also sad at the loss of Towani, although she vowed to return and see him and Warrick again. The starship successfully took off, and Teek, alongside Warrick, saw his friend leave the moon for good.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" /> He spent the rest of his life with the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]<ref name=\"Star Tours\">[[Star Tours (real-world)|''Star Tours'']]</ref> in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> the [[Star Tours/Legends|Star Tours]] travel agency began offering [[Endor Express|tours]] of the forest moon.

He was less than a [[Imperial standard meter|meter]] tall, and due to his fast metabolism, he had extremely quick speed, which allowed him to run faster than any other being on Endor.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\n[[File:BrimleyHug.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Teek with his friend Noa Briqualon]]\nTeek was friendly and hospitable toward others and often went out of his way to help them. When he first met Towani and Warrick, he led them to his home and offered them food and shelter, even though Briqualon was far less accommodating. When Teek was worried for the two children, he sneaked muffins to Towani and Warrick, despite Briqualon's orders that he specifically not do so.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\nTeek was optimistic and mischievous, though not harmful, and he spent much of his time laughing and giggling with others, something that Briqualon discouraged. He displayed a strong sense of mirth, such as when he threw [[Nut/Legends|nuts]] at Warrick. Teek displayed inventiveness, such as when he framed the Sanyassan [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]], almost single-handedly getting the group past that particular obstacle. Teek once again demonstrated his inventive nature when dealing with Terak&mdash;although Teek was smaller than the warlord, he found a way to incapacitate the Sanyassan. Similarly, Teek used flames to scare off Terak's blurrgs and stole a guard's uniform in Terak's Keep.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\nTeek was a brave and loyal friend to Briqualon, Warrick, and Towani. He tried to hide the secret of Briqualon's starship from the two guests, and he later risked his life on several occasions during the rescue of Towani. Teek stayed with his companions when he could easily have used his immense speed to quickly get to safety.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\n==Talents and abilities==\nLike all members of his species, Teek was extremely quick, and when at full speed, he often looked as if he was a mere blur. He used his speed as both a source of amusement and as a weapon of sorts&mdash;he once used his speed to tie a Sanyassan to a tree on Endor. He could also play a type of [[Flute/Legends|flute]], which he used with Towani, Briqualon, and Warrick when they played music and danced together in Briqualon's house.<ref name=\"Ewoks\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|I did not even see it coming.
