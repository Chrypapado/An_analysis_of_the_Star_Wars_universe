Just as you...|Baron Volnos Ryo, to his daughter Tasha Ryo|Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 2}}\n[[Baron/Legends|Baron]] '''Volnos \"Ox\" Ryo''' was the head of the [[Clan Ryo|Ryo Syndicate]] after the [[Despot War]]. [[Gender/Legends|He]] was [[Marriage/Legends|married]] to the [[Je'daii Order|Je'daii]] [[Kora Ryo]] and was the [[Parent/Legends|father]] of Je'daii [[Tasha Ryo]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[Volnos Ryo's father]] was the ruler of the [[Clan Ryo|Ryo Syndicate]], one of the [[Nine Houses]] that ruled [[Shikaakwa]]. However, Volnos was the second of three brothers, so [[Gender/Legends|he]] never expected to lead. Wealthy as he was, he traveled and studied on the settled worlds in the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]]. He gained the nickname \"Ox\" and became a champion of the Ryo Syndicate. Eventually, his younger brother, [[Hawk Ryo]], introduced him to fellow [[Je'daii Order|Je'daii]] [[Kora Ryo|Kora]]. Ox and Kora [[Marriage/Legends|married]] and had a daughter, [[Tasha Ryo|Tasha]], who would spend most of her life trying to please both her [[Je'daii Temple Master]] mother and her [[Crime lord/Legends|crimelord]] father.<ref name=\"DotJ0\">''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0]]''</ref>\n\nWhen his father and older brother were [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the [[Despot War]] by [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Hadiya]], Ox became the new [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] of [[Clan Ryo]], a role he felt unprepared for.<ref name=\"DotJ0\" /> One of the first things he did as the new Baron of his clan was to pledge allegiance to the Despot Queen in order to avoid his father and brother's fate, who had refused to do so. However, his apparent loyalty to Hadiya served to hide his true agenda: revenge for the [[Death/Legends|death]] of his relatives. To achieve his goal, Ryo arranged for the assassination of Hadiya at the hands of Je'daii [[Daegen Lok]].<ref name=\"DotJ10\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 5]]</ref>\n\nHis marriage to Kora would eventually deteriorate over time, with Ox spending most of his leisure time with his mistresses at the [[Ryo Fortress]] while his wife and his daughter were training in the ways of the [[The Force/Legends|Force]] on [[Tython/Legends|Tython]].<ref name=\"DotJ7\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 2]]</ref><ref name=\"DotJ10\" /> By Shikaakwan laws, Ox and Kora were still married, but by the Je'daii laws and customs, she ended their marriage, so revolted was she by the man her husband had become. Furthermore, they often argued over him wanting their daughter to join him, as Kora was afraid that Tasha would get corrupted like her father. As far as she was concerned, their daughter was a Je'daii, not the heir of a crime lord.<ref name=\"DotJ7\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|141|Eruption}} {{Mo}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 2]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 4]] {{C|Vision to [[Tasha Ryo]]}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 2]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 4]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 5]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 1]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 2]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0]]'' {{1stm}} {{1stp}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Volnos Ryo\n|ru=\u0412\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441 \u0420\u0451\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ryo, Volnos}}\n[[Category:Clan Ryo]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Shikaakwa residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
