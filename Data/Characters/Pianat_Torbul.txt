Though he had concerns about [[Red Hand Squadron]]'s reputation for taking no prisoners, he recognized that the team's ability made them a valuable asset.\n\nBria proposed an invasion of [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]] to Torbul, in order to shut down the [[Besadii/Legends|Besadii]] clan's spice processing and [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] operations. After she found solutions to his concerns, Torbul gave her permission to proceed. Shortly before the [[Battle of Ylesia]], [[Alliance Intelligence]] discovered the existence of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] and Torbul realized they would need all the resources they could get to uncover more information. He contacted Bria, and ordered her to take all the spice they could from Ylesia and not to share anything with the [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] who had been recruited to assist in the mission.\n\nUsing the funds raised from the attack on Ylesia, Torbul sent intelligence units to infiltrate [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]] and discovered that the Death Star plans were being stored on [[Toprawa/Legends|Toprawa]]. He then asked Red Hand Squadron to lead a [[Battle of Toprawa|mission]] to recover those plans.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Pianat Torbul\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance Military officers|Torbul, Pianat]]\n[[Category:Corellians|Torbul, Pianat]]\n[[Category:Humans|Torbul, Pianat]]\n[[Category:Males|Torbul, Pianat]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters|Torbul, Pianat]]"}}}]}}}}
