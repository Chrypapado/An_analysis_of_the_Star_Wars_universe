Can't they just treat you as a friend?''\"<br />\"''Nope. But come on! Let's find something to do!|Garr and Boba Fett|Boba Fett: Crossfire}}\n'''Garr''' was a [[Excargan]] whose [[Garr's mother|mother]] and [[Garr's father|father]] were presumed [[Death/Legends|dead]] after [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] [[First Battle of Excarga|invaded]] [[Excarga/Legends|Excarga]]. Along with other orphans, Garr traveled on the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Candaserri]]'' to an orphanage on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], who came aboard shortly after the [[Conquest of Raxus Prime]], was the same age as Garr and they quickly became friends. They parted on Bespin when [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] caught up to Fett, and Garr sought help from the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Glynn-Beti]] and [[Ulu Ulix]] despite Fett's hatred of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].\n\n==Biography==\nGarr was born in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]<ref name=\"Age\" /> on the mining planet [[Excarga/Legends|Excarga]] to a [[Garr's mother|mother]] and [[Garr's father|father]] who were [[Ore/Legends|ore]] traders. As a ten-[[Standard year/Legends|year]]-old<ref name=\"Boba Fett: Crossfire\" /> [[Excargan]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]],<ref name=\"The Essential Reader's Companion\" /> Garr's [[Gender/Legends|gender]] had not yet been determined; until Excargans experienced physical changes around age thirteen, they were genderless. Compared to [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] at the same age, Garr had shorter [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and Garr's skin was darker than Fett's<ref name=\"Boba Fett: Crossfire\" /> [[Color/Legends|tan-colored]] skin.<ref name=\"AOTC\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Garr had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] that Fett thought had a merry look.<ref name=\"Boba Fett: Crossfire\" />\n\nRaised to respect the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Garr wished to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and train as one of them. When the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] [[First Battle of Excarga|invaded]] to take control of the mines, Garr's [[Parent/Legends|parents]] hid their child while they themselves were made [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]]. After a [[Second Battle of Excarga|counterattack]] by the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], Garr's parents could not be found and were presumed dead, though Garr believed they were alive and would return for their child. The orphan was taken to the Republic [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Candaserri]]'' which was journeying to an orphanage on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]] with other younger children.<ref name=\"Boba Fett: Crossfire\" />\n\nFellow ten-year-old Boba Fett came aboard the ship at [[Raxus Prime/Legends|Raxus Prime]]. He had been saved from the [[Conquest of Raxus Prime]] by a group of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] and the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Glynn-Beti]]. He had never had a friend before, but Garr quickly became his first and best friend. Despite that, Garr only knew Fett by the alias \"Teff\" which he used to avoid being identified by the Jedi; he hated them after recently witnessing [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] kill his father, [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]]. In addition to keeping his name a secret, Fett concealed or lied to Garr about other personal details, such as when Garr would make observations about the [[Cloning/Legends|clones]] being creepy. After several [[Standard day/Legends|days]] of friendship, Fett asked if Garr was a boy or a girl, and Garr explained the difference in their [[Species/Legends|species]]. Garr found it frustrating that other children would not simply treat each other as people instead of girls and boys. Fett said that the other kids were stupid and should just treat Garr as a friend like Fett did.<ref name=\"Boba Fett: Crossfire\" />\n\nBoth children loved to explore the ''Candaserri'' despite the prohibition against orphans roaming the ship unattended. Garr did not share Fett's interest in space, but both children were interested in starships and observed them being armed and serviced by [[Droid/Legends|droids]] in the rear docking bay. Fett unthinkingly revealed that his father had taught him how to fly, which was something Garr's mother would have had a fit over. In all of their explorations of the ship, Garr and Fett had been unable to access the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]]. Their curiosity almost resulted in being left floating in space when they went on a spacewalk to look into the bridge from the outside.<ref name=\"Boba Fett: Crossfire\" />\n\nUpon arriving at Bespin, Fett tried to escape from the Jedi at the orphanage. He was followed by Garr, who brought to Fett his flight bag that he had forgotten. While trying to persuade Fett to come back, they were interrupted by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]]. Sing grabbed Fett and Garr began kicking her to get her to release him. In response, Sing dangled Garr over a [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]]-long drop, but pulled the child back after Fett called Garr his friend. Despite that, Fett then acted cold and repeated to Garr that he had no room for friends. Garr still would not leave him until Sing's hand went to her [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. Garr fled and told the Jedi about Fett and Sing. Garr was present on a [[Cloud car/Legends|cloud car]] with Glynn-Beti and her [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], [[Ulu Ulix]], that pursued and fired upon Sing as she flew Fett's stolen ship, the ''[[Slave I/Legends|Slave I]]''. Flying between ''Slave I'' and the cloud car to prevent Sing from firing upon them almost resulted in Fett losing his life. Though Fett considered involving the Jedi to be a betrayal, he recognized that Garr had just intended to help.<ref name=\"Boba Fett: Crossfire\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Boba Fett: Crossfire]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Garr\n}}\n\n[[Category:Excargans]]\n[[Category:Genderless individuals]]\n[[Category:Individuals from Excarga]]"}}}]}}}}
