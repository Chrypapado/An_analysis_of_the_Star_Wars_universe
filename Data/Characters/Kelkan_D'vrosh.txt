Straight from a Twi'lek freighter!|Kelkan D'vrosh, on the ryll that was raided from the ''Astan Tor''|Oblivion's Kiss}}\n'''Kelkan D'vrosh''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[drug dealer]] who resided in the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Gadrin]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]].\n\n==Biography==\nKelkan D'vrosh was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He was trained as a [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] and a [[Spy/Legends|spy]], and at one point, D'vrosh served a group of [[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub Corporation]] executives as a [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]]. He later left their service and became employed by the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]], but he increasingly found himself being asked by the Federation to do illegal acts, and the pressure of his work caused his morals to be eroded. He left the Federation prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] and became involved in illegal activities, such as theft, [[Pirate/Legends|piracy]] and handling illicit goods.\n\nD'vrosh eventually became a [[drug dealer]] and took up residence a small, pre-fabricated building in the factory zone of the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Gadrin]]. In about [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], D'vrosh obtained possession some [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] that had been captured during a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] raid on the [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] ''[[Ashtan Tor]]'', and he added an additive to the drugs. However, unknown to D'vrosh, the ryll had already been treated with a medical additive, and the two additives reacted to each other and turned the ryll into a deadly toxin. D'vrosh subsequently sold some of the tainted ryll to his friend [[Merik Darou]], an assistant of [[Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren|Lavina Wren]], Cularin's [[Senator/Legends|senator]], and after consuming some of the drug, Darou entered a [[Coma/Legends|coma]]. D'vrosh believed that Darou's condition would led to him being arrested, so he purchased a ticket to journey aboard the [[White Nova (star liner)|''White Nova'']], a laxurious [[Luxury liner/Legends|star liner]] that was due to travel from Cularin to the planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Dvrosh traveled up to the vessel aboard a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] and hid himself in the ship's hold, from where he planned to slip out with the liner's cargo when the ''White Nova'' arrived on Coruscant. However, a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] were sent by Lavina Wren to find D'vrosh, and they captured him from the hold before the liner departed from the Cularin [[Star system/Legends|system]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Oblivion's Kiss]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:D'vrosh, Kelkan}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Drug dealers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]\n[[Category:SoroSuub Corporation employees]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Trade Federation members]]"}}}]}}}}
