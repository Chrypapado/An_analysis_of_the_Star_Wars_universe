Born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] after [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Battle of Endor/Legends|death]] at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], she was discovered to be strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and came to the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] at a young age. She was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] by Master Skywalker and eventually achieved the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] under his tutelage. As a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], she was assigned long-term intelligence missions to various corners of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], gathering information for the Jedi and working to help the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. After many [[Time/Legends|years]] in this role, Eelysa took an [[Padawan/Legends|apprentice]] in the [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] [[Saba Sebatyne]], training her on her [[Homeworld/Legends|home planet]] of [[Barab I/Legends|Barab I]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Eelysa worked alongside Saba Sebatyne with the [[Wild Knights]], a group of Jedi Knights that all had ties to Eelysa and her Barabel apprentice. In this capacity, Eelysa worked undercover on the planet [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], and she played an integral part in rooting out [[Yuuzhan Vong]] collaborators, such as [[CorDuro Shipping|CorDuro]], who had allied themselves with the invaders. As the war waged on, Eelysa came into conflict with Yuuzhan Vong [[Warrior caste|Warriors]], sustaining injuries that nearly [[Death/Legends|killed]] her. Despite bouncing back from the near-fatal assault, she was killed in action on Corellia, a victim of the [[voxyn]], genetically engineered creatures designed by the Yuuzhan Vong to hunt Jedi. Eelysa's death was felt by her apprentice, who informed Master Skywalker of the Jedi Master's death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|What happened, Master Skywalker?''\"<br />\"''A million people died a moment ago, all in great pain, and with great suddenness.|Eelysa and Luke Skywalker|The New Rebellion}}\nThe [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] Eelysa was born on the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] shortly after [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Battle of Endor/Legends|death]].<ref name=\"TNR\" /> Neither of her parents were [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], so it came as some surprise when she was revealed to be highly attuned to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].<ref name=\"MaFR\" /> She was eventually recognized by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and while still a child, she was brought to the [[Jedi Praxeum|Jedi Academy]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. While there, she began to develop into a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] under the personal tutelage of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] Skywalker.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> In [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], Eelysa was part of the youngest and most powerful class at the Praxeum. During one training session, in which Skywalker was demonstrating his [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetic]] abilities to six members of this class, the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Master felt a great [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|disturbance in the Force]]. Shocked and dismayed by the great loss of life, Skywalker temporarily lost control of the boulders, the trees, and the [[R2-D2/Legends|droid]] that he was levitating, causing the objects to crash to the ground. Skywalker's students, including Eelysa, were troubled by this, not having felt the disturbance themselves. While three of the students went to retrieve the [[Droid/Legends|droid]], R2-D2, Eelysa ran to her Master's side, hoping to discover what had caused him to lose control. Skywalker told the young girl that a million people had just suddenly [[Death/Legends|died]]. Unbeknownst to both, this event was the first sign of the [[Almanian Uprising]], and the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Kueller]] had just eliminated the population of [[Pydyr]]. Skywalker, concerned over the event, immediately ended his lessons for the [[Time/Legends|time]] being and left for Coruscant to deal with the threat.<ref name=\"TNR\" />\n\n[[File:Njo_sabasebatyne.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Eelysa took the Barabel, Saba Sebatyne, as her apprentice.]]\nSometime after the conclusion of this crisis, Eelysa completed her [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] at the Academy. While still a young teenager, she was chosen by Skywalker to undergo several year-long intelligence missions. In this capacity, she went deep undercover, losing all contact with many of the people she had met at the Academy, including [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> By this time, Eelysa had developed her own opinions on the nature of the Force, views that sometimes contrasted sharply with her Master's own. Despite this professional disagreement, Skywalker trusted Eelysa and accepted her judgments during her undercover work. These missions did not always have a specific goal in mind, and Eelysa would receive explicit instructions from Skywalker only after she had arrived at the location.<ref name=\"MaFR\" />\n\nIn her role as a Jedi agent, Eelysa spent several years completing tasks for the Jedi. While undercover, [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] kept tabs on Eelysa, recording the many missions that she had undertaken. Based on their reports, they believed the young Jedi Knight had completed close to five assignments. Among these included breaking [[Slavery/Legends|slaver rings]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], making contact with the reclusive [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]], and working against the [[Diversity Alliance]]. It was during one of these missions that she arrived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Barab I/Legends|Barab I]]. She discovered a Force-sensitive [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]], [[Saba Sebatyne]], whom she took as her [[Padawan/Legends|apprentice]]. This action was contested by Master Skywalker, who believed that Barabels did not have the appropriate temperament to become Jedi. However, Eelysa disagreed, claiming that if [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] such as [[Lowbacca]] could become Jedi, then Barabels could as well.<ref name=\"MaFR\" /> Unable to send the Barabel back to the Jedi Praxeum due to her undercover mission and Skywalker's objections, she trained Saba Sebatyne on Barab I. Eelysa spent years training the Barabel, causing a close bond to form between the two. However, she was eventually chased off the planet by a hunting-pack that had subscribed to the [[Anti-Humanism|anti-Human]] doctrines of the Diversity Alliance.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> Sometime after this, Eelysa also came upon the failed Jedi student, [[Izal Waz]], who had halted his studies due to his crippling [[Salt/Legends|salt]] addiction. She was able to help the [[Arcona/Legends|Arcona]] overcome his addiction, bringing him back on the path to Knighthood.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\" /> Sebatyne, whom Eelysa eventually promoted to Jedi Knight, took over Waz's training shortly thereafter. Sebatyne came to train other pupils of her own, including her son, [[Tesar Sebatyne]], and his [[hatchmate]]s, [[Bela Hara]] and [[Krasov Hara]].<ref name=\"MaFR\" />\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong War===\n{{Quote|Thanks again. I don't know that Izal and the Barabels would have gotten me out of there without you.''\"<br />\"''Without me, I don't know that they would've needed to.|Eelysa thanks Han Solo for rescuing her|The New Jedi Order: Recovery}}\nDuring the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Eelysa and several of her apprentices, including Waz and Sebatyne, were deployed on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. The group maintained a [[Starfighter/Legends|fighter]] [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] known as the [[Wild Knights]], but Eelysa did not usually fly with the squadron. In order to keep a low profile, the Jedi Knights made their base at the abandoned [[Cinnabar Moon Retreat]]. While on Corellia, Eelysa uncovered a conspiracy involving [[CorDuro Shipping|CorDuro]] and [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]], who were collaborating with the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], a species of [[extra-galactic]] religious zealots who had invaded the galaxy. CorDuro was misappropriating resources meant for refugees, and as part of their collaboration with the Yuuzhan Vong, they planned to turn over samples of [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] so that the invaders could study its usage. Eelysa and her apprentices discovered the rendezvous point and planned to disrupt the meeting.<ref name=\"Recovery\" />\n\nThree [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] after the [[Battle of Duro (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Duro]], while working undercover, Eelysa was discovered by several Yuuzhan Vong [[Warrior caste|Warriors]] and was injured in combat, sustaining thoracic lacerations. Although not killed by the Yuuzhan Vong, Eelysa had to undergo treatment in a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]] at a local medcenter.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> While there, she was in danger of being discovered by the [[Peace Brigade]], Yuuzhan Vong sympathizers who were responding to [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]]'s decree that the Yuuzhan Vong would stop their invasion if the galaxy would surrender all Jedi.<ref name=\"Balance Point\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref> As a result, she was admitted anonymously by Izal Waz and kept a secret by the Jedi-sympathizer, [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Jasper Nimbi]]. Despite these precautions, three Peace Brigaders, [[Roxi Barl]], [[Gad Sluggins]], and [[Dex (Peace Brigade)|Dex]], who were searching for [[Leia Organa Solo]], a fellow Jedi, nearly discovered Eelysa. She was saved by the intervention of Han Solo, who noticed the Peace Brigaders searching the medcenter. During the [[Lightfight|firefight]], Eelysa aided her rescuer by using the Force to distract the Jedi hunters and even telekinetically used her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to eliminate Dex.<ref name=\"Recovery\" />\n\nSolo was grateful for the assistance, and when Dr. Nimbi suggested that the Solos take Eelysa with them on their departure, Solo played along. Hoping to get Eelysa out of the medcenter, Solo and his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]], with the help of Izal Waz, claimed that the recovering Eelysa was their daughter, [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]]. Although [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]], the new [[Governor/Legends|Governor-General]] of Corellia, did not believe the ruse, Solo's threats of disgracing Sal-Solo in front of the local media allowed them to leave with Eelysa in tow. The Solos bought the bacta tank from the medcenter, allowing Eelysa to recover within the device while they escaped the world.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> However, before they left with the portable bacta tank, Sal-Solo specified that the tank should only be filled with generic bacta, not the premium strain that came from the capital of [[Coronet/Legends|Coronet]].<ref name=\"MaFR\" /> The Solos, tailed by Izal Waz and CorSec personnel, made their way back to the docking bay where they had parked their [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. The Solos took on Waz as an extra [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] after he introduced himself, and the group left Corellia with Eelysa. Unbeknownst to the Solos, Waz allowed several other Jedi onto the ''Falcon'', the Hara sisters and Tesar Sebatyne, who were under orders from their Master to protect Eelysa.<ref name=\"Recovery\" />\n\n====Escape====\n{{Quote|As good as new, but I'm not going to the new base.

Eelysa's protectors revealed themselves to the Solos and convinced the group to make a course for a rendezvous near Corellia where Eelysa could be cared for. Despite escaping the Peace Brigade, Saba Sebatyne was not at the rendezvous point, and the group waited a full day for their contact to arrive. The generic bacta within Eelysa's bacta tank became contaminated, causing the bacta to become murky with fluids. As a result, she went into a [[Force healing/Legends|healing trance]] to avoid fatal [[Poison/Legends|poisoning]]. The rendezvous point was actually the place where CorDuro was planning to turn over the bacta samples to the Yuuzhan Vong, and the extended wait was due to a delay in the meeting time. Eventually, the CorDuro ship ''[[Star Roamer]]'' appeared alongside a [[I'Friil Ma-Nat|Yuuzhan Vong corvette analog]], and Saba Sebatyne's squadron, the Wild Knights, attacked. With the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} help, the ship was captured and the bacta confiscated. Eelysa was treated with a new supply of bacta from the captured ship and was able to recover.<ref name=\"Recovery\" />\n\nAfter obtaining the bacta, Eelysa and her group returned to their [[Cinnabar Moon]] base, where both Eelysa and Leia Organa Solo, the latter of whom had sustained massive injuries to her [[Limb/Legends|legs]] during the [[Battle of Duro (Yuuzhan Vong War)|fall]] of [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], recovered from their wounds. After emerging from the bacta tank, Eelysa spoke with the Solos several times, helping them to understand Barabel customs and aiding Organa Solo in her recovery.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> Eventually, Eelysa noticed a mysterious task force investigating the [[Craeen system|system]], and, believing the base to be compromised, suggested that her group abandon the Cinnabar Moon Retreat and seek a more secure location.<ref name=\"MaFR\" /><ref name=\"Recovery\" /> While the Wild Knights prepared to change bases, Eelysa prepared to return to Corellia. Although her allies were worried that she was reentering active duty too soon, Eelysa was adamant that she keep an [[Eye/Legends|eye]] on Thrackan Sal-Solo's [[Centerpoint Party]] and their goal of reactivating [[Centerpoint Station]] for use as a [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]].<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> While back on Corellia, Eelysa continued to monitor the situation and made regular reports back to Master Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"SbS\" />\n\n====Death====\n{{Quote|Eelysa, something caught her.''\"<br />\"''Something?''\"<br />\"''This one doesn't know, but she is gone. Eelysa is no more.|Saba Sebatyne and Luke Skywalker|The New Jedi Order: Star by Star}}\nAlthough still undercover during her duties on the planet Corellia, Eelysa was once again discovered by the Yuuzhan Vong. A bio-engineered creature designed to hunt Jedi, a [[voxyn]], sensed Eelysa's Force-sensitivity and was able to corner her. During the struggle with the beast, Eelysa radiated her fear to her apprentice, and Saba Sebatyne communicated the feeling to Luke Skywalker at a secret rendezvous point. However, Eelysa was unable to fend off the beast, and she fell in combat. Her death was felt by her apprentices, which affected them greatly.<ref name=\"SbS\" /> Although others in the Jedi Order, such as [[Danni Quee]], believed that Eelysa's death might negatively impact Sebatyne, the Barabel continued to fight in the Yuuzhan Vong War, performing her duties alongside the other Jedi.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref> Skywalker's belief that Barabels could not be effectively trained as Jedi was changed over time due to the competence of Eelysa's Barabel apprentices, and he admitted that he had been wrong.<ref name=\"MaFR\" /> Eelysa's legacy was eventually honored in her apprentice, Saba Sebatyne, who became a Jedi Master and even served on the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi Council]] with Skywalker.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I\">''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Perhaps they have found out, or perhaps it is something else, but Eelysa is frightened.''\"<br />\"''Frightened?

Skywalker's belief that Barabels could not be trained to be Jedi was opposed by Eelysa, who proved her Master wrong by training a Barabel apprentice who eventually became a member of Skywalker's [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]].<ref name=\"MaFR\" /><ref name=\"Dark Nest I\" /> Additionally, Eelysa was a compassionate individual, radiating good intentions and warm feelings toward those around her. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, this trait helped comfort Leia Organa Solo, who had been feeling depressed over her relationship with her husband at the time.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> This hope for the best caused her to take Izal Waz as her apprentice, even though he had become addicted to salt and had already dropped out of the Jedi Order. Her optimism was rewarded when Waz completed his training, vindicating Eelysa's faith in him.<ref name=\"MaFR\" /><ref name=\"Recovery\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\nEelysa sometimes flew a starfighter into combat, and although her apprentices and their Wild Knight squadron often flew into battle, Eelysa did not usually join them. She was well-versed in a variety of [[Language/Legends|languages]], and she could speak [[Barabel (language)|Barabel]], [[Mandaba]], and [[Cheunh/Legends|Cheunh]]. During her missions, she also learned to read and write Selonian.<ref name=\"MaFR\" /> While working as an undercover agent, Eelysa was reputed for her toughness and strength, returning to active duty almost immediately after her recovery from a near-fatal Yuuzhan Vong attack.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> This trait was noted by her apprentices and her Master, and when she radiated fear during her final battle with a voxyn, those that knew her immediately believed her to be in grave danger as a result. Eelysa's close bond with her apprentice gave them an intimate connection, and Saba Sebatyne could easily pick up on the emotions of her Master. This bond was closer than that shared between Eelysa and Master Skywalker, and during her death, Sebatyne felt much greater anguish over her passing than Skywalker.<ref name=\"SbS\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n:\"''Forgive this one.

During the Yuuzhan Vong War, she was able to go into a healing trance, using the Force to sustain her body even after the bacta within her bacta tank had become contaminated over prolonged use.<ref name=\"Recovery\" /> She was able to use the [[Mind trick/Legends|Jedi mind trick]] and could even perform [[battlemind]]. She had some ability to [[Farsight/Legends|predict the future]] and was skilled in telekinesis.<ref name=\"MaFR\" /> Eelysa carried a lightsaber and was able to telekinetically control it, which she did against Peace Brigade [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]]. However, her skill was unable to overcome Yuuzhan Vong Warriors, causing her to be grievously injured, and she was unable to fend off the attacks of the Jedi-hunting voxyn, leading to her death.<ref name=\"SbS\" /><ref name=\"Recovery\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEelysa was created by [[Kristine Kathryn Rusch]] for the [[1996]] novel ''[[The New Rebellion]]''. In the book, Eelysa was introduced as a young member of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy and was identified as being born after the Battle of Endor. Her appearance in the novel was later referenced in the ''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' and ''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' in [[1998]] and [[2000]] respectively. Eelysa reappeared in the novels when author [[Troy Denning]] used the character in [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|''The New Jedi Order'']] book series, first appearing in the [[eBook]] ''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]''. This story, which was a lead-in to the full-length novel, ''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]'', revealed that the character had become a Jedi Knight and was now teaching apprentices of her own. However, in ''Star by Star'', the character was killed in an off-screen reference when one of her apprentices, Saba Sebatyne, felt her Master's death. The character's death was referenced two more times in the book series, in ''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]'' and ''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''.\n\nFurther information on Eelysa's activities was later revealed by [[Daniel Wallace]] in two reference articles, \"[[Making a Full Recovery|Making a Full ''Recovery'']],\" a companion to the eBook on the [[Wizards of the Coast]] website, and ''[[Who's Who in the New Jedi Order]]'' in [[Star Wars Insider 57|''Star Wars Insider'' 57]]. These articles revealed her activities between ''The New Rebellion'' and ''Recovery'', clarifying that she had been deep undercover during that time. The character was referenced several more times in later reference books, including ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' and ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', which served to summarize her activities in the novels. In the [[2010]] card set, ''[[2010 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 5]]'', a sketch card by [[Kate Glasheen]] featured an image of Eelysa.\n\nIn the short reference article, \"Making a Full ''Recovery'',\" Eelysa is mentioned to have gone on undercover missions for the Jedi for approximately \"a dozen or so years.\" However, this does not fit the timeline, as Eelysa is shown to be in training at the Jedi Praxeum in [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]],<ref name=\"TNR\" /> and she dies in [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]],<ref name=\"SbS\" /> leaving no room for twelve years of these missions to take place. The author of the article, Daniel Wallace, clarified on the [[Jedi Council Forums]] that the \"dozen or so years\" reference is in error and should be seen as just a vague approximation.<ref name=\"Dan Wallace\">{{JCFcite|postnum=28810516|board=Authors and Artists|thread=The Official Daniel Wallace Discussion Thread|user=Dan Wallace|PTtime=7/22/08 11:49am|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906130352/http://boards.theforce.net/threads/the-official-daniel-wallace-discussion-thread.5863946/page-22}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Rebellion]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|57|Who's Who in the New Jedi Order}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20021003recovery|text=Making a Full ''Recovery''|int=Making a Full Recovery|archivedate=20091124204313}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Alien Species]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2010 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 5}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Eelysa#legends\n|es=Eelysa\n|pl=Eelysa\n|pt=Eelysa\n|ru=\u0418\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Masters of the New Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Wild Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
