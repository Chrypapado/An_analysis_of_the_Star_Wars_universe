Born in late [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], he was kidnapped by [[Ilir Post]] nearly [[5 ABY/Legends|five years]] after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] when Soontir Fel defected to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Post and his [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] handlers hoped to use Fel to pressure the other Fels into giving up the location of [[Syal Antilles Fel|Soontir's wife]], which would allow them to pressure Soontir Fel himself. Fel's parents refused to comply, and Todr Fel tracked down Post and killed him himself. Fel and his parents then took refuge with the New Republic.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early childhood===\n[[File:Fyric2.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Fel as a young child]]\nFyric Fel was born to [[Todr Fel|Todr]] and [[Ajai Fel]] around late [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]]. He was raised with the rest of the [[Fel dynasty|Fel family]] on the [[Fel estate|estate]] of his uncle, [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]], an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Starfighter/Legends|fighter]] [[Ace/Legends|ace]].<ref name=\"Family Ties\" /> The Fels believed strongly in family loyalty and duty, and Fel was raised among an extended clan that included [[Syal Antilles Fel|Wynssa Starflare]], Soontir Fel's wife, and her sons [[Davin Fel|Davin]] and [[Chak Fel|Chak]].<ref name=\"Family Ties\" /><ref name=\"Fact File 122\">''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 122]]''</ref>\n\nStarflare was secretly the sister of [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] in [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. She knew that [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]] was willing to use this information against her, and when Soontir was captured by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] nine months after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Starflare fled into hiding, taking Fel's cousins with her.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" />\n\n===Kidnapped===\n{{Quote|Fel first brought CorSec down on Post. Post later did time on Kessel and blames it on Fel.''\"<br />\"''And for that a little boy dies?|Corran Horn and Isplourrdacartha Estillo|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties}}\nOne month later, Fel was [[Mission to Corellia (Rogue Squadron)|kidnapped]] by [[Ilir Post]], an old rival of Soontir's, with the backing of [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]]. The kidnappers left a note demanding a meeting, looking for the Fels to turn over Starflare's location. While [[Corellian Security Force]] officers [[Corran Horn]] and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]] were assigned to the investigation, Fel's parents kept the note to themselves, looking to solve the situation on their own.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n[[File:Fyric-hostage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Post holds Fel hostage.]]\nAjai convinced three Rogue Squadron pilots whom Antilles had sent to take Starflare to safety to meet with the kidnappers and placed a tracking device on them. Based on that signal, Todr proceeded to Post's hideout. The pilots, working with Horn and Wessiri, stormed the compound, but Post emerged on a balcony, holding Fel and a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. He demanded that the attackers leave, but Todr, realizing that Fyric would end up [[Death/Legends|dead]] if Post were not stopped, took the risk of his dying in a fall and shot Post from within the woods. Fel tumbled from the balcony, but [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo]] made a diving catch that saved his life.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\nThe Rogues took Fel away from the hideout, where they found Todr waiting. They returned Fel to him as he explained why he had made the shot, and they offered the Fels save haven in the New Republic, to which Soontir had defected. After some thinking, Todr and Ajai accepted the offer, taking Fel to safety with the Rogues. They were nearly killed again when [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] working for Imperial Intelligence attacked their [[Starship/Legends|starship]] on their way off [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], but timely intervention by Horn defeated the attacking fighters.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFyric Fel was created by [[Michael A. Stackpole]], who wrote ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties]]'', the story arc in which Fel appears. The comic gives two conflicting images of Fel. There is a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] of Fel as a baby with black hair, while Fel himself appears in the story as a blond.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n* [[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 26|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 26]] {{1stm}}\n* [[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 27|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 27]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fel, Fyric}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Fel family]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
