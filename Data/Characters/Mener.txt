A group led by [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Varias]], including Sergeant Mener, [[Officer/Legends|Officers]] [[Hirka]], [[Druno Kener|Kener]] and [[Jornel Savas|Savas]], and several CorSec troopers, was dispatched from Coronet to investigate. The unit discovered an old and fully automated [[Corellia Droid Factory|droid factory]], presumably built in secret by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] during the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"SWG:TtLV\" /> The CorSec ignored that the factory had been reactivated by [[IG-88A/Legends|IG-88]] for his project of [[Droid Revolution]].<ref name=\"SWG:DtDF\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Disable the Droid Factory|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nThe droid factory was defended by many hostile battle droids but the Corellian government was reluctant to send reinforcement since it would like to avoid drawing the attention of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Independent spacers were thus recruited to assist the CorSec in the factory.<ref name=\"SWG:TtLV\" /> As Sergeant Mener was tasked to lead the fight against the droids, he enrolled several spacers to destroy as many droids as possible. The spacers destroyed more than two dozens of droids, including [[B1-Series battle droid]]s, [[B2 super battle droid/Legends|B2 super battle droids]], and [[Droideka/Legends|droidekas]].<ref name=\"SWG:D10BD\" /><ref name=\"SWG:D10SBD\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Destroy 10 Super Battle Droids|Corellia}}</ref><ref name=\"SWG:D5D\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Destroy 5 Droidekas\" on Corellia</ref> The spacers also fought an epic battle against a very powerful prototype of an [[EV-series supervisor droid/Legends|EV-series]]-like battle droid.<ref name=\"SWG:DtPD\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Destroy the Prototype Droid|Corellia}}</ref> Eventually, the CorSec and the spacers would successfully manage to shut down the Corellia Droid Factory.<ref name=\"SWG:DtDF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSergeant Mener was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:D10BD\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Sergeant Mener was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Corellia Droid Factory|Corellian Droid Factory]]\" arc with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Game Update 12|Game Update 12]]\", on [[August 10]], [[2009]].<ref>{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/posts/list.m?topic_id=976424|text=Game Update 12: Engineering Trader|archivedate=20090816090206}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=68410&month=082009|text=The Quest Continues|archivedate=20111124005620}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Destroy 10 Battle Droids}}\n*{{SWGWiki|Destroy 10 Super Battle Droids}}\n*{{SWGWiki|Destroy 5 Droidekas}}\n*{{SWGWiki|Destroy the Prototype Droid}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mener}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
