He was transferred to scout trooper duty when it was discovered he could skilfully pilot a [[74-Z speeder bike/Legends|74-Z speeder bike]].\n\nDuring a tour of duty on [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], Oberk encountered and held [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] operative [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] at [[Blaster pistol/Legends|pistol]]-point and, after Oberk ordered his comrade to ready his speeder, [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]], with whom Organa had recently become acquainted, attacked Oberk with his [[Spear/Legends|spear]]. Oberk was momentarily distracted before Organa bludgeoned him with a branch and knocked him unconscious.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Oberk first appeared as a scout trooper extra in the film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], released in [[1983]]. In the film, he was portrayed by an uncredited actor. Prior to the film, in the [[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (novel)|''Return of the Jedi'' novel]] released earlier that same year, an unnamed scout trooper with Oberk's role appeared. He is alone when capturing Leia Organa, has different dialogue in the scene, and Organa kills him with his own blaster after Wicket Warrick attacks him. The film's script, featured in ''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]'', refer to him as \"Scout #1.\" In [[1999]], Oberk was given a name and a brief backstory in the [[Endor Limited]] edition of the [[Star Wars Customizable Card Game]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CCG|set=Endor Limited|link=Endor-Dark/large/corporaloberk.gif|cardname=Corporal Oberk}}\n*{{CCG|set=Endor Limited|link=Endor-Dark/large/freeze.gif|cardname=Freeze!}}\n*{{FFCite|1|WIC3, ''Wicket W.
