She was the [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] of a [[cargo freighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] who went missing during a run in with [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] along the [[Corellian Run/Legends|Corellian Run]]. Left to manage the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] alone, but never giving up hope that her husband might one day return, Binna Jode took the time to help out Bestine locals and friends with a number of difficult situations. However, she eventually left Bestine after receiving news that her husband had been detected alive in [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]], and was on his way [[Homeworld/Legends|home]] to reunite with her.\n\n==Biography==\n===Toy for the Children===\n{{Quote|Stormtroopers attacked a Rebel base near here.

She was [[Marriage/Legends|married]] to a [[cargo freighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], but her husband went missing when he was forced to make a wild jump into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] after running into [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] on the [[Corellian Run/Legends|Corellian Run]].

During her time at this [[City/Legends|city's]] local [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], Jode held out hope that her husband might one [[Standard day/Legends|day]] return.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nWhile she eagerly awaited for a miracle, Jode found herself befriending locals, and becoming involved in a number of their affairs. At one point, Jode learned of an Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] attack on a nearby [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] base. However, during the attack, the Imperial's [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] fire went astray, almost [[Death/Legends|killing]] an innocent civilian family. Feeling for their plight, Jode sent the the traumatized family to stay with a friend of hers.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBinna Jode did not feel there was much else she could do, but when a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] stopped by the Cheapside Cantina to speak with her, she asked the individual to help deliver a toy for the family's [[Youngling/Legends|children]]. The spacer agreed to deliver the toy, which was contained inside an empty metal [[Fuel/Legends|fuel]] drum, crudely decorated with [[Color/Legends|colorful]] [[Painting/Legends|drawings]]. However, the spacer was unable to meet with the family personally, because they had been called away to tend to a child who had been put into a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]]. Nevertheless, a Human woman named [[Deehan]] met with the spacer outside of Bestine, and promised to give the toy to the children. For the spacer's part in helping the family's children, Binna Jode prepared for the individual a delicious, special [[Foodstuff/Legends|casserole]]. The casserole resembled a [[worrt casserole]], prepared from the meat of the planet's native [[Species/Legends|species]] of [[Worrt/Legends|worrt]], however Jode did not specify the contents of her meal.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Clone Wars Veteran===\n[[File:CheapsideCantina.jpg|300px|thumb|The Cheapside Cantina in Bestine]]\n{{Quote|Some sleemo took a pot-shot at my favorite old guy, Gen Horosi.

Can you deliver it?''\"<br />\"''Why did someone shoot at Gen Horosi?''\"<br />\"''Aw, nobody was gunning for him specifically. It was just some wild-eyed glitterstim druggie on a jaunt, blasting things and giggling. Happens too much around Cheapside. Can you help Gen?|Binna Jode and a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nMeanwhile, a local veteran of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] named [[Gen Horosi]] ended up getting injured when a crazed [[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]] addict took a random pot-shot at him. Friends of Herosi helped the old war veteran home, but he was still in need of [[Medic/Legends|medical]] attention. When Jode learned of the incident, she gathered what [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] she could and purchased a [[stimpak]]. Fortunately for Jode, the spacer who had helped her earlier continued to patronize the cantina, and agreed to personally deliver the medical device to Herosi, who could sometimes be found wandering aimlessly outside of town. Jode was grateful for the spacer's help, but reminded the individual not to mention [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], as merely saying his name was known to agitate Herosi. With this in mind, the spacer encountered the injured war veteran walking around the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] outside of Bestine. When Herosi saw the spacer approaching him, he was at first troubled, as he nearly mistook the spacer as a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederate]] [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droid]]. However, when he realized he was actually being given a stimpak for his injuries, he settled down somewhat, and willingly took the device. Again, for the spacer's help, Jode offered the spacer a meal, this time in the form of a soup. The soup was in fact a special gift from [[Bren Kingal]], a junior [[Officer/Legends|officer]] of the Rebel Alliance who handled security matters in [[Mos Taike]], a small town on Tatooine. The soup was prepared from the secret recipe of Bren Kingal's sister.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Maternity Gift===\n{{Quote|Friend of mine, Peele Noonal, just had her first child and&mdash;oh, thanks, I'll pass along your kind words&mdash;and her nurse wrapped the baby in Peele's shirt.

I want you to take this shirt of mine to Peele as a maternity gift.|Binna Jode, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA friend of Binna Jode, named [[Peele Noonal]], in the meantime gave [[Birthday/Legends|birth]] to her first child. Following the birth, a [[Nurse/Legends|nurse]] wrapped the baby in Noonal's [[shirt]]. When Jode learned of this, she was somewhat dismayed, as she knew that Noonal's shirt would be ruined by the baby. To help out her friend, Jode took off her black sidebutton shirt, and asked the spacer who had helped her earlier to deliver it to the young mother. Although the spacer was somewhat perturbed by the fact that the shirt was still warm, the maternity gift nevertheless made its way to Noonal, who was found wandering outside of Bestine before an impending [[Sandstorm/Legends|sandstorm]]. For the spacer's part in helping out her friend, Jode offered a [[Glass/Legends|glass]] of [[Alcohol/Legends|alcohol]] on the house.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Dinnis the Blade===\n[[File:SpecialCasserole.png|125px|thumb|Binna Jode's special casserole]]\n{{Quote|I got this datadisk from a friend on Corellia.

If I left, he'd never find me.|Binna Jode and a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBinna Jode continued to hold out hope that her long lost husband might one day return. Although Jode was not eager to stay in Bestine as the proprietor of the Cheapside Cantina, she feared that her husband might never find her if she were to leave. Her wait would soon come to an end, when Jode one day received a [[Datacard/Legends|datadisc]] from a friend on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] which supposedly contained information on her husband. However, the data on the report, which was sent by a friend who had attempted to look for her husband, ended up getting corrupted. In order to salvage the data, Jode asked the helpful spacer to deliver the datadisc to a data [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] friend of hers known as [[Dinnis|Dinnis the Blade]].<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nThe spacer obliged, and carried the valuable datadisc outside of town to meet with the eccentric data slicer. After handing over the datadisc, Dinnis the Blade provided a quick analysis, and concluded that Binna Jode's husband may have actually survived. He told the spacer that he was receiving some kind of distant signal from [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]], and that although the husband had a bad [[Engine/Legends|engine]] and was low on fuel, he was flying on his way [[Homeworld/Legends|home]]. After receiving Dinnis' analysis, the spacer headed back to the Cheapside Cantina to deliver the good news.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Alone with Her Dreams===\n{{Quote|That&mdash;that's&mdash;oh.

Alone with my dreams.|Binna Jode, upon hearing news of her husband|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nWhen the spacer finally returned to the confines of the Cheapside Cantina to provide news of Binna Jode's husband, Jode was was shaken, and said she needed to sit down. She briefly thanked the spacer, but asked that she be left alone to collect her thoughts. Per tradition however, Jode did provide the spacer a final gift in the form of a [[dustcrepe]]. The meal was a type of light crepe commonly served on Tatooine, comprising of a dry type of [[Bread/Legends|bread]], [[Wheat/Legends|wheat]], and a filling of [[Diet/Legends|herbivore]] meat. Although Binna Jode asked to be left alone, she did say the spacer came in handy, and that she might have more work in the future. However, this was not to be. Sometime after receiving news of her husband, Binna Jode left the Cheapside Cantina, and could no longer be found there.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Is this for me? From Binna? She's the nicest lady in the galaxy. Excuse me, I just put the baby to bed and I reeeally need some sleep.|Peele Noonal, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBinna Jode had fair skin, auburn [[Hair/Legends|hair]], and brown-colored [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Although she did not appear particularly aged, she on at least one occasion referred to herself as an \"old lady.\" Jode was a kind and helpful individual, who was often willing to look after her friends. Her friend, Peele Noonal, referred to Jode as the \"nicest lady in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]\" for providing her with her own sidebutton shirt. Jode was also quite charitable, in that she had scrounged together her own credits to help purchase a stimpak for the Clone Wars veteran Gen Herosi. Jode especially cared for her husband, and never gave up hope that he might one day return to the Cheapside Cantina to find her, even years after he went missing. In addition to her talents as a bartender, Binna Jode was also a skilled [[Chef/Legends|cook]], known to make delicious meals such as casseroles.<ref name=\"AED\" /> She was also able to defend herself in combat, as she had at least some skill as a [[Blaster carbine/Legends|carbineer]] and [[Pike/Legends|pikeman]].<ref name=\"Total\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref>\n\nAlthough Binna Jode was not very outspoken about her [[Politics/Legends|political]] beliefs, she did appear to have at least some disdain for the Galactic Empire. When Imperial stormtroopers injured an innocent civilian family, she derided the fact that they could not aim. She also had ties to some individuals who had no love for the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]], including Rebel junior officer Bren Kingal, and the Clone Wars veteran Herosi. Jode spoke fondly of Gen Herosi, claiming he had \"been through more than any [[Squad/Legends|squadron]] of stormtroopers.\"<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|Why is this shirt warm?''\"<br />\"''The shirt is warm? Oh yeah, I guess that's because I just took it off.|A spacer and Binna Jode|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring her time as bartender at the Cheapside Cantina in Bestine, Binna Jode usually wore a blue colored, formfitting muscle shirt with beige stripes, and a blue [[Clothing/Legends|pleated skirt]] with beige trim on the bottom. She also wore white colored women's shoes. At one point, Jode did wear a black sidebutton shirt, which she took off to give as a gift to her friend, Peele Noonal, so that she could have proper clothing after giving birth.<ref name=\"AED\" /> As a carbineer, Binna Jode kept a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] carbine as her primary weapon.<ref name=\"Complete\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> She also possessed [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] weapons.<ref name=\"JTL\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:BinnaShirt.png|175px|thumb|Binna Jode's black side button shirt, given to Peele Noonal as a maternity gift]]\nBinna Jode was a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]], prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"AED\" /><ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Players who performed a series of [[W:c:swg:Quest|quests]] for Jode in [[W:c:swg:Bestine|Bestine]] had to deliver an [[W:c:swg:Empty Fuel Drum|empty fuel drum]] to Deehan, a stimpak to Gen Herosi, [[W:c:swg:Binna's Shirt|Binna's shirt]] to Peele Noonal, and a [[W:c:swg:Datadisc|datadisc]] to Dinnis the Blade.
