He wore a [[Colonel/Legends|colonel's]] cap from the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]] and a [[BlasTech 8000 heavy blaster]].\n\nHis two [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] bodyguards never left his side, and he regularly used his position to abuse others, which prevented his numerous crew as well as the citizens of [[Providence]] to truly like him.\n\nColonel [[Viyenah]] of the [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] suspected him to be of [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] birth and to have been part of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], where he would have acquired his leadership qualities. After his retirement, he became a cargo pilot before becoming a dreadful [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]], with a crew mainly composed of renegade soldiers, traitors and brutish men.\n\nFerd was sentenced to death on more than twenty planets, and had bounties on his head all over [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], since he dedicated his operations to merchant ship attacks and planetary facilities assaults. He also practiced [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]], and always killed useless prisoners.\n\nHe nourished a feud with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] ever since Solo caused him to have a cargo loss.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nFerd was brutal and impulsive, readily tyrannical and dominating. Viyenah compared him to a dictator.\n\nThis attitude led his crew to both show him admiration and fear him at the same time, as he didn't hesitate to execute those who broke his rule.\n\nVulgar and repulsive, he was nonetheless smart and was capable, able to deploy intelligence and cunning in perilous situations. He was also an exceptional [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlmar Varangi Ferd was created by [[Jean-Michel Ringuet]] for the ambiguously [[canon]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] help \"Providence\" which appeared in the French magazine ''[[Avalon 1]]''. He was illustrated by [[Jean-Marc Emy]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Avalonmag|1|Providence}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ferd, Almar Varangi}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy enlisted personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
