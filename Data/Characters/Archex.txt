Vulnerable to misrule, corruption, to getting mired in bureaucracy instead of effecting real change. Stability ensures progress for everyone. That's the whole point of government.|Cardinal, aboard the ''Absolution''|Phasma (novel)}}\n'''Archex''', formerly known as '''CD-0922''' or '''Cardinal''', and nicknamed \"'''Emergency Brake''',\" was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] who held the [[First Order military|military]] [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Captain]] in the [[First Order]]. His skills were spoken of with high regard even by [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]]. At some point before the [[attack on Tuanul]], Archex interrogated the [[Resistance]] [[spy]] [[Vi Moradi]] aboard the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Absolution]]'' for information about the past of his rival, Captain [[Phasma]]. After he confronted Phasma about her past and her involvement in the [[death]] of [[General]] [[Brendol Hux]], the two fought and he was defeated, almost dying in the conflict. He was saved by Vi Moradi and taken to the Resistance.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Crait]], Archex joined Vi Moradi on [[Batuu]] on her mission to establish a new base for the Resistance. In order to trick [[Lieutenant]] [[Wulfgar Kath]] and the First Order into leaving Batuu, he [[Suicide|sacrificed]] himself and was killed after Kath's ship exploded shortly after taking off.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nArchex was [[Reproduction|born]] and spent [[Gender|his]] early life on [[Jakku]]. At some point in his childhood, his [[Archex's mother|mother]] died, leaving him to survive on his own with other orphans of the desolate [[planet]]. Near the end of the [[Battle of Jakku]], Archex and several other [[Gallius Rax's child soldiers|orphans]] were invited by [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] General Brendol Hux to come with the Imperials into the [[Unknown Regions]]. Archex agreed, wanting to leave behind the cruelty of Jakku. He was inducted into the [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[cadet]] program and given the codename CD-0922. CD-0922 was one of the first of the new stormtroopers of what would later become the [[First Order]], having been taught by Hux that the [[New Republic]] was disorderly and corrupt, and that only the First Order could bring peace and order to [[the galaxy]].<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\n===Captain of the First Order===\n{{Quote|I was his personal guard. He handpicked me on Jakku, trained me himself. I was infinitely loyal. From the time I first put on this armor, he trusted me to keep him safe. He designed it himself because he said red was a color of power. Every moment he spent in my company, he knew he was safe.|Cardinal to Vi Moradi regarding Brendol Hux|Phasma (novel)}}\nA loyal adherent of the tenets of the First Order, CD-0922 eventually became a [[captain]] and was put in charge of stormtrooper physical training. Stationed on the ''[[Finalizer]]'', he served with distinction as both the lead stormtrooper trainer as well as Hux's personal [[Bodyguard|guard]]. CD-0922 was presented with a personalized set of [[Cardinal's armor|red stormtrooper armor]] and given the name Cardinal by Hux.<ref name=\"Phasma\" /> At one point, Cardinal was present aboard a [[Upsilon-class command shuttle|''Upsilon''-class command shuttle]] that was flying away from a [[desert]] world.<ref name=\"Cardinal card\">{{FFGXW2|First Order Conversion Kit|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Cardinal|cardname=Captain Cardinal}}</ref>\n\n===Rivalry with Phasma===\n[[File:Young_Phasma_on_Parnassos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Phasma left her homeworld to join the First Order, and became a rival of Captain Cardinal.]]\nRoughly a [[Standard year|year]] after Cardinal was presented with his personalized [[First Order stormtrooper armor|armor]], Hux conducted a scouting mission to the planet [[Parnassos]]. While surveying the planet, [[Palpatine's yacht|Hux's ship]] was shot down by an [[Parnassos' automated defense system|automated weapons system]] and crashed on the planet. With the help of members of the local [[Scyre]] tribe, including [[Phasma]], Hux was able to find his [[Starship|ship]] and make contact with the First Order. Hux returned to the ''Finalizer'' with Phasma in tow, along with a young girl from Parnassos named [[UV-8855|Frey]]. Phasma wore a set of dirty, ill-fitting stormtrooper [[armor]].\n\nCardinal was instructed to familiarize Phasma with the ''Finalizer'', First Order technology, and her duties as a stormtrooper. His role as head trainer was to be split with Phasma, who would focus on training the teenage and adult stormtroopers, and he would be transferred to the ''[[Absolution]]''. Hux would also get a new personal guard, allowing Cardinal to focus on the expanding stormtrooper training program.<ref name=\"Phasma\" /> These changes upset Cardinal, who was suspicious of Phasma and jealous of her close relationship to Hux, his father figure. This jealousy increased a year later, when Phasma received her own [[Phasma's armor|personalized armor]]. Soon after, Hux died of a mysterious illness, and his son, [[Armitage Hux|Armitage]], took his place as head of the First Order [[infantry]].<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\n====Interrogating Vi Moradi====\n[[File:Amaka.png|thumb|right|200px|Cardinal questioned Vi Moradi, a Resistance spy, as part of his investigation into Phasma's past.]]\nIn around [[34 ABY]],<ref name=\"Phasma date\">[[Phasma (novel)|''Phasma'']] takes place a few [[Standard week|weeks]] before the beginning of ''[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire]]'' which begins during the events of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], which is dated to [[34 ABY]] by ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''.</ref> a starhopper [[pilot]]ed by [[Resistance]] [[spy]] [[Vi Moradi]] was captured by the ''Absolution''. Moradi had been assigned by General [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] with researching Phasma. Cardinal suspected that Moradi had information about Phasma after her ship's logs were checked, and it was discovered she had recently traveled to Parnassos. He took Moradi to an interrogation room hidden deep within the [[battlecruiser]] to ask her what she knew about Phasma. Cardinal was not trained in interrogation; however, a meeting was planned on the ''Absolution'' for the next [[Standard day|day]] between Cardinal, Phasma, Armitage, and [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]], and he was desperate for information he could take to Hux to prove Phasma was dangerous. Cardinal [[torture]]d Moradi in an electrified apparatus in an attempt to get information.<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\nMoradi shared with Cardinal the stories she had heard from a woman from Parnassos named [[Siv]], the former healer and religious leader of the Scyre. Moradi told Cardinal about how Brendol had crashed on Parnassos and was captured by the [[Claw (clan)|Claw]], a rival tribe to Phasma's Scyre. Phasma and a few of her loyal [[soldier]]s, including Siv, freed Hux and his stormtroopers from the Claw and promised to help him find his crashed ship. Moradi revealed how Phasma betrayed her clan in order to save herself by partnering with Brendol in a deal that would have her come with him off-planet and join the First Order. The story of Phasma's rise to power and betrayal were not enough for Cardinal to report to Armitage Hux. Moradi then revealed that the Resistance had learned through [[Slicer|slicing]] the First Order's computer systems that Brendol's death was caused by a [[Parnassos beetle|venomous beetle]] found on Parnassos. She asserted that Phasma brought the [[beetle]] aboard and killed the elder Hux. The only other person who would recognize the symptoms of the beetle, Frey, died in a weapons accident six [[Standard month|months]] prior. Shocked and appalled by this revelation, Cardinal went to the younger Hux's quarters on the ''Absolution'' to reveal Phasma's betrayal.<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\n====Confronting Armitage Hux and Phasma====\n{{Quote|You're only out for yourself. Your loyalty means nothing. Brendol should've left you where he found you!|Cardinal, to Phasma|Phasma (novel)}}\n[[File:Hux_and_Phasma.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Captain Cardinal learned that his mentor, General Brendol Hux, was killed by Captain Phasma and General Armitage Hux.]]\nCardinal reported to Hux that Phasma had killed his father. Hux asked if Cardinal had any physical evidence proving this to be true. When Cardinal admitted he did not, the younger Hux revealed that he knew Phasma had killed his father, and had, in fact, arranged for the murder. Hux then asked Cardinal if he was still loyal, both to himself and the First Order. Cardinal responded in the affirmative and was dismissed. Cardinal then returned to his quarters and got drunk, upset by what the First Order had become. Early the next morning, he told Moradi that Hux was involved in his father's death, and asked for anything else he could use to stop Phasma. Moradi then revealed that, a few years before Brendol's trip to Parnassos, Phasma betrayed her own [[Unidentified family (Phasma)|family]] to the Scyre in order to survive, killing her parents and permanently crippling her brother, [[Keldo]]. She presented Cardinal with the [[dagger]] Phasma had used in the deed, along with a specimen of the beetle used to kill Brendol. By this point, Cardinal had grown to respect Moradi, and as he left to confront Phasma, he left the door to the interrogation room unlocked, giving her the means for her escape. Cardinal took the evidence with him to a meeting with Ren, Hux, and Phasma, only to be turned away by Hux. Cardinal returned to his duties, going through the motions for the rest of the day, and spent the evening getting drunk.<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\n[[File:StormtroopersandPhasma.png|thumb|right|250px|Phasma assumed control of the stormtrooper training program after Cardinal's fall from grace.]]\nAt breakfast the next morning, Cardinal took an extra packet of rations specifically for his [[hangover]]. He cleaned himself up, shaved his head, and polished his [[armor]], in preparation for a final confrontation with Phasma. Cardinal found Phasma in his [[Simulation room|training room]], and they argued over his training methods. Cardinal attacked Phasma. As they fought, Cardinal attempted to stab Phasma with her knife, but was unable to penetrate her armor. She took the knife in return and stabbed him twice in the chest, then left him to die on the training room floor. Moradi, during her escape attempt, found Cardinal. She then [[transport]]ed him via [[Hovergurney/Canon|hovergurney]] to a [[hangar]] in the ''Absolution''. She then stole a ship, planning to return to Parnassos because she had promised to go back for Siv and her child, [[Torbi]].<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\n===Mission to Batuu and Black Spire Outpost===\nFour months after the [[Battle of Crait]], Archex and Vi Moradi go to Batuu in hopes of setting up a resistance base there. However, their ship crashes, leaving both Moradi and Archex injured, though not severely. Archex mainly gathered food and other resources, trying to be useful to Moradi. He often whittled wood in the shape of local animals and sold them to a local toy shop. When Moradi was able to set up a [[Black Spire Ruins|base in the ruins]] near [[Black Spire Outpost|BSO]], Archex set up electric lighting and helped organize the base. The Resistance decided that they would launch the First Order shuttle and have it transmit a message to the main ship saying that Moradi died in custody and that [[Batuu]] is not of importance to the First Order, then blow up the ship, making it look like a malfunction. During the fight with [[Wulfgar Kath]], Archex distracts Kath and his soldiers by showing up wearing stormtrooper armor, painted red. He then realizes that Kath will not leave the planet and allow Moradi to transmit the message, Archex then sacrifices himself by allowing Kath to take him prisoner. He then dies in the explosion.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Look, I didn't know what it felt like to have a full stomach until Brendol Hux found me.

Cardinal learned to survive as an orphan, living off of sand [[rat]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[cricket]]s, before being offered to be taken off-world by Brendol Hux during the last moments of the Battle of Jakku. Cardinal was grateful to the Imperials, and loyal to Hux in particular. In the First Order, Cardinal found his inner strength to survive and thrive,<ref name=\"Phasma\" /> becoming a principled instructor for the First Order.<ref name=\"Cardinal card\" /> Feeling as if he finally had a purpose as a physical trainer for stormtroopers, Cardinal wanted to share that feeling with other orphans found throughout the Unknown Regions of the [[galaxy]] where the First Order operated. Cardinal believed that the New Republic sowed chaos through its disorder and corruption, and that chaos led to suffering. In Cardinal's opinion, the First Order would bring order to the galaxy, lifting all beings up to live in peace and prosperity.<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\nIt was Cardinal's undying loyalty to Brendol and the First Order that eventually lead to Cardinal's jealously of Phasma.<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\nCardinal was a devoted disciple of the First Order and strong [[teacher]].

However, Cardinal did not care for confrontation, and hoped the First Order spread its will over the galaxy through diplomacy more than war.<ref name=\"Phasma\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Main|Cardinal's armor}}\n[[File:CardinalHelmetBlackSeries.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cardinal's stormtrooper armor was painted red, the color of power.]]\nCardinal wore a set of [[Color|red]] stormtrooper armor, designed personally by Brendol. The armor was colored red because Hux believed it was the color of power. The armor was presented to Cardinal during a ceremony in front of thousands of other stormtroopers, and Cardinal, formerly CD-0922, was officially named Cardinal in reference to the [[Cardinal (bird)|bird]] of the same name.
