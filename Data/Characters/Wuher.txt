With this he was able to learn what types of drinks would be desirable with various [[species]].<ref name=\"USW\" />\n\nWuher disliked the concept of [[slavery]], feeling that nobody should have to be a slave. He himself could have had an easier [[time]] in his work at Chalmun's Cantina by purchasing slaves, but decided against it. He disliked [[bounty hunter]]s for similar reasons, but could not refuse their patronage for fear of what it would do to his reputation. His abiding dislike of droids stemmed from the [[death]] of his [[parent]]s at the hands of [[battle droid]]s [[Battle on Arkax Station|during]] the [[Clone Wars]]. He had great respect, however, for [[Jedi]], who saved him from an entire [[battalion]] of droids. His nightly ritual was to go home and drink a glass of [[blue milk]] to settle his [[stomach]].<ref name=\"theirkind\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWuher was portrayed by British actor [[Ted Burnett]] in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> However, his dialogue was dubbed with the voice of another actor.{{Source?}}\n\nThe character was known only as \"The Bartender\" at the time of the film's release, but the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] source \"[[Be Still My Heart: The Bartender's Tale]]\" from the ''[[Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina]]'' anthology named him as \"Wuher\" while the ''[[Mos Eisley Adventure Set]]'' gave the character's name as \"Cedo Partu.\" The character's name was later confirmed to be the former.\"<ref name=\"DB\">{{DB|character|wuher|Wuher|archivedate=20110517074434}}</ref> The new name was later confirmed as part of the [[canon]] continuity established on [[April 25]], [[2014]]<ref name=\"End of EU\">{{SW|url=news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|text=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page}}</ref> in the reference book ''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"USW\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Sand Will Provide|book=Star Wars (2015) 37|bformatted=''Star Wars'' 37|manual=1}}\n*''[[Bounty Hunt]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''\n*[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy (audiobook)|''A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy'' audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars: A New Hope (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: A New Hope'' junior novelization]]\n*''[[Star Wars: A New Hope Graphic Novel Adaptation]]''\n*[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|''Star Wars'' LINE Webtoon]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Heroes Path]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Original Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''\n*''[[Star Wars in Pictures: The Original Trilogy]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Treasury: The Original Trilogy]]''\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Luckless Rodian|book=From a Certain Point of View}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=Not for Nothing|book=From a Certain Point of View}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=We Don't Serve Their Kind Here|book=From a Certain Point of View}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=You Owe Me a Ride|book=From a Certain Point of View}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Secrets of Long Snoot|book=From a Certain Point of View}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=Born in the Storm|book=From a Certain Point of View}}\n*[[From a Certain Point of View (audiobook)|''From a Certain Point of View'' audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=21|story=[[Tales from Wild Space: The Heist]]}} {{Flash}}}}\n\n===Non-canon appearances===\n*{{Droid Tales|Mission to Mos Eisley (episode)|Mission to Mos Eisley}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWCT|Wuher - Cantina Bartender - Base Series 1|Wuher - Cantina Bartender - ''Base Series 1''}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|159|A Certain Point of View (Star Wars Insider)#Star Wars Insider 159: \"Not Coming Soon to a Theater Near You!\"|Not Coming Soon to a Theater Near You!}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]\n*{{BuildR2Cite|5|Droid Directory|2-1B-series Medical Droids, Part 1}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''\n*{{LEGOCite|classic|75205|Mos Eisley Cantina}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|58|Weapons & Uniforms|2-1Bs in the Galaxy}}\n*''[[Star Wars Search and Find Volume I]]''\n*[[Star Wars Day-at-a-Time Calendar 2020|''Star Wars'' Day-at-a-Time Calendar 2020]]\n*''[[Star Wars: How Not to Get Eaten by Ewoks and Other Galactic Survival Skills]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*{{SWKidsYoutube|CZp8Civk2co|Every Language in Star Wars Movies &#124; Star Wars By the Numbers|archiveurl=https://archive.is/1vR7M}} {{Po}}\n*{{DisneyGallery|Practical}}\n*{{DisneyGallery|Connections (Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian)|Connections}}\n*{{InsiderCite|201|Star Wars: The Mandalorian Season One Companion|''Star Wars: The Mandalorian'' Season One Companion}}\n*{{Databank|wuher|Wuher|archivedate=20150827081234}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Wuher#kanon\n|es=Wuher\n|fr=Wuher\n|ja=\u30a6\u30fc\u30cf\u30fc\n|ka=\u10d5\u10e3\u10f0\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\n|pl=Wuher\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
