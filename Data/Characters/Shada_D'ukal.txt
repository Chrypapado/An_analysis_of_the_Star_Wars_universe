She can be very disarming.|Han Solo|The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth}}\n'''Shada D'ukal''' was a deceptively decorative-looking [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] from a mysterious militaristic order of female warriors known as the [[Mistryl Shadow Guard]].\n\n==Biography==\nShada had come from a family with several uncles. She joined the Shadow Guard in [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]]<ref name=\"SoP\">''[[Specter of the Past]]''</ref>. In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Shada was a member of the six-person Shadow Guard team led by [[Manda D'ulin]], when they were approached by the scientists working on the [[Hammertong/Legends|Hammertong]] project to guard a prototype of the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star's]] superlaser. When the mission went wrong, Shada and her friend and comrade [[Karoly D'ulin]] stole the [[Strike-class medium cruiser|Strike Cruiser]] being used to transport the prototype, and escaped to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where they posed as the [[Tonnika sisters/Legends|Tonnika sisters]] in an effort to hire a freighter to help take a section of the device back to [[Emberlene]].\n\n[[File:Tonnika1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shada disguised as [[Tonnika sisters/Legends|Brea Tonnika]] in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]]]]\nBy [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Shada was traveling the galaxy aboard the freighter ''[[The Fury]]'' with Mistryl trainee [[Dunc T'racen]], when the pair of them were caught up in a complex con run by [[Ghitsa Dogder]] and [[Fenig Nabon]]. After this, Shada became bodyguard for the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] chief [[Mazzic]]. In this job, she appeared with plaited hair and a blank expression&mdash;until trouble started. Then she was all business, throwing enameled [[zenji needle]]s with lethal accuracy and using her more-than-capable combat skills to protect the smuggler chief.\n\nShe was present at the [[Ambush on Trogan|meeting on Trogan]] where she defended Mazzic and later at the meeting on [[Hijarna]] where she assisted at the formation of the [[Smugglers' Alliance]].\n\n[[File:Mazzic_and_Shada.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Mazzic]] and his bodyguard Shada D'ukal]]\n\nIn [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], Shada prevented Karoly from assassinating Mazzic, and came under punishment from the [[Eleven Elders of the People|Eleven]] who led the Mistryl. She left Mazzic's employment to avoid the Mistryl hunter teams, seeking to join up with the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Instead, [[Leia Organa Solo]] offered Shada's services to [[Talon Karrde]], who was [[Hunt for Jorj Car'das|heading into]] the [[Kathol sector]] to locate a copy of the [[Caamas Document]]. Shada accompanied him, and the two grew fond of each other. When Karrde located information that revealed the truth about the fake [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], Shada was there to stop the cloned Major [[Grodin Tierce]] from killing [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]] and a Mistryl leader, [[Paloma D'asima]]. As a result the hunter teams were called off and Shada officially joined Karrde's new joint intelligence organization, taking the role of Karrde's unofficial second in command that had been open since [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] left the organization.\n\nDuring the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Shada continued to serve as Karrde's lieutenant and business-partner. She assisted in transporting [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi Initiates]] from [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. There were rumors that she had passed on details of the Hammertong device to Karrde, allowing [[Booster Terrik]] to mount a superlaser aboard the ''[[Errant Venture]]''.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nModel [[Christine Hewett]] played Shada D'ukal in the guise of [[Brea Tonnika/Legends|Brea Tonnika]].<ref name=\"StarWars.com Message Boards\">{{SWBoards|url=http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&start=1545|thread=Holocron continuity database questions|user=[[Leland Chee]]|date=2007-09-26|time=05:34 PM|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608155139/http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&start=1545}}</ref>In the short story You Owe me a Ride, it is revealed that canonically, Karoly and Shada are Brea and Senni Tonnika.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Shada-TLC3.jpg|thumb|200px|Shada in the [[The Last Command (comics)|comic adaptation]] of ''[[The Last Command]]''.]]\n\n*''[[When the Desert Wind Turns: The Stormtrooper's Tale]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[The Mos Eisley Cantina Pop-Up Book]]''\n*''[[Hammertong: The Tale of the \"Tonnika Sisters\"]]'' {{1stID}}\n*[[Star Wars: A New Hope (Cine-Manga)|''Star Wars: A New Hope'' Cine-Manga]]\n*''[[Nightlily: The Lovers' Tale]]''\n*''[[Be Still My Heart: The Bartender's Tale]]''\n*[[Empire 15|''Empire'' 15]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Hutt and Seek]]''\n*''[[The Last Command]]'' {{1stID|Shada}}\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]''\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]''\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Shada.jpg|thumb|150px|Shada D'ukal.]]\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]''\n*{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Light/large/doubleagent.gif|cardname=Double Agent}}\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*{{GamerCite|3|The Smuggler's Alliance}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|91|Refresher Reading}} {{Po}}\n*{{InsiderCite|95|Ask Lobot|Q&A}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 1]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Art: Visions]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{DB|character|talonkarrde|Karrde, Talon|archivedate=20100414092348}}\n*{{DB|character|tonnikasisters|Tonnika, Brea & Senni|archivedate=20110913184426}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Shada D'ukal}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Shada D'ukal#legends\n|es=Shada D'ukal\n|nl=Shada D'ukal\n|ru=\u0428\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0414'\u0443\u043a\u0430\u043b\n|fi=Shada D'ukal\n|deFA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:D'ukal, Shada}}\n[[Category:Car'das members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Mistryl]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Smugglers' Alliance members]]"}}}]}}}}
