Both of the young Je'daii were drawn to Bodhi Temple where [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] exposed their natural talents in the arts. A talented [[Sculptor/Legends|sculptor]] renowned across [[Masara]] continent, Brock was also skilled at cooking [[rumbat]] stew. Years after their Journey ended, Brock and his wife became the parents of [[Lanoree Brock|Lanoree]] and [[Dalien Brock]]. Living in the Je'daii settlement surrounding the Temple of Arts, Brock taught at Bodhi, amusing his students and colleagues with his magic tricks. One of his students, Master [[Xiang]], would later go on to teach under his watch. When his children were growing up, he would tell them tales and legends from Je'daii history, including a cautionary tale of [[Osamael Or]] and his fateful mission into the [[Old City (Tython)|Old City]].<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\nDuring the [[Despot War|war]] between Tython and [[Despot Queen]] [[Hadiya]] and her [[Despot Army|army]], Brock served some of his time on the planet [[Nox]] where the fighting was especially vicious. Following the war and the supposed death of his son, Brock rarely saw his daughter, who had become a [[Je'daii Ranger]] by the time of Dalien's reemergence during the [[Stargazer Uprising]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBrock wore his hair long, usually tied up, but allowed it to fall across his shoulders when at home. Brock believed that his son's inquisitive nature was a sign that he would make a fine Je'daii in time; he always believed that Dalien would find his own way. When spending time with his children, Brock would often take them to the [[Edge Forest]] where his explorer's heart would yearn to venture into its vastness.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]'' {{1st|[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=P\u00e8re de Lanoree Brock\n|ru=\u041e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u041b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0411\u0440\u043e\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brock, Lanoree's father}}\n[[Category:Je'daii Masters]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified fathers]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Force-users]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]"}}}]}}}}
