He declared that it was his \"mission\" to provide the local settlers and farmers with the supplies that they needed to stave off attacks by [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] and the occasional [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] raiders. He was a very passionate salesman, and when asked questions he would try to somehow promote his wares during his replies. At some point, Larp came into possession of the [[Cassus Fett's Battle Armor|battle armor]] of [[Cassus Fett]], which he sold for the price of 15,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. He may have done business with [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] during the latter's time on Dantooine.\n\nLarp stayed on the planet even after the [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|Attack on Dantooine]] and the resulting destruction of the Enclave. During the subsequent process of recovery, he ran a general store in [[Khoonda]], where he encountered and may have dealt with [[Meetra Surik]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', the player&mdash;as the Jedi Exile&mdash;can ask Adum Larp to join the [[Khoonda Militia]] before the [[Battle of Khoonda]], but he declines. He disappears from Khoonda after the battle, but it is not known whether or not he died during the battle.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Adum Larp#legends\n|es=Adum Larp\n|fr=Adum Larp\n|nl=Adum Larp\n|pl=Adum Larp\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Larp, Adum}}\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
