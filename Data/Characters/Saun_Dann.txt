He was also secretly a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] who maintained his own network of connections. During the [[Life Day/Legends|Life Day]] [[holiday]] of [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] [[Blockade of Kashyyyk (1 ABY)|blockaded]] Kashyyyk and declared martial law on the [[Planet/Legends|world]], an [[Unidentified Imperial guard|Imperial guard]] wandered into [[Trading post Wookiee Planet C|Dann's shop]] and took a [[groomer]] without paying, much to the trader's chagrin. Dann then made his way to the [[Chewbacca's home|home]] of his Wookiee friend [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], who had not yet arrived home for the holiday, and whose family was worried about his absence.\n\nAfter Dann assuaged the Wookiees' fears and gave them all Life Day gifts, he reassured the Alliance's [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]&mdash;speaking to them via [[wallscreen]]&mdash;that the family would be safe. However, an Imperial search party entered the home on a hunt for ties to the Rebels. Dann nervously attempted to prevent the Imperials from discovering that Chewbacca, a well-known Alliance hero, was one of the home's residents, but the search party's [[Unidentified Imperial commander (Blockade of Kashyyyk)|Commander]] ordered him to leave. Dann later returned and found that a recently-arrived Chewbacca had eliminated a [[B4711|stormtrooper]] who had been left to guard the home, and the trader used the family's wallscreen to convince a suspicious [[Unidentified Imperial officer (wallscreen)|Imperial officer]] that the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|trooper]] had fled his post.\n\nDuring another Life Day, which came at some point between [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] and [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Dann celebrated the occasion by ordering two cases of candy for [[Youngling/Legends|children]] in need. When the shipment was late, he recruited a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to track it down, and the spacer discovered that the candy had been stolen and eaten by the stormtrooper [[TK-555]]. Dann resolved to find a replacement gift for the children. He again ordered candy for needy children the following Life Day, but the same fate befell it, and the spacer again brought the trader bad news.\n\n==Biography==\n===Imperial blockade===\n{{Quote|Why all the long hairy faces?

However, the Empire [[Blockade of Kashyyyk (1 ABY)|blockaded]] the world and declared martial law in an effort to root out Rebel activity. An [[Unidentified Imperial guard|Imperial guard]] wandered into Dann's shop during the blockade and indicated that he was off-duty; Dann subsequently attempted to sell him a [[pocket-sized aquarium]] but was rebuffed by the fish-hating guard. Dann then offered the man a [[groomer]] but had to step away to answer a call on his [[wallscreen]]. Chewbacca's [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] [[Mallatobuck/Legends|Mallatobuck]] appeared on the screen, and Dann, speaking in code, informed the worried Wookiee that Chewbacca and Solo were indeed on their way home. The trader then returned to his customer, who took the groomer without paying after Dann extolled the product's virtues.<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" />\n\nDann made his way to [[Chewbacca's home|Chewbacca's treetop home]]<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" /> in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]]<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test 2\">''[[Tyrant's Test]]''</ref> with a delivery of Life Day gifts for the family, but he first had to make his way through an Imperial patrol. After arriving, he reassured the melancholy Wookiees that Chewbacca would make it through the patrol as well, and then distributed his gifts: a [[Music box/Legends|music box]] for Mallatobuck; a [[mini-transmitter]] and an [[instruction cassette]] for Chewbacca's son, [[Lumpawaroo/Legends|Lumpawarrump]]; and a new [[proton pack]] for the [[Mind evaporator/Legends|mind evaporator]] that belonged to Chewbacca's [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]]. When Attichitcuk sat down in the mind evaporator's chair, Dann covertly slipped him an erotic [[cassette]] that allowed the Wookiee to interact with [[Mermeia]], a [[Hologram/Legends|holographic]] fantasy woman. While Attichitcuk enjoyed some [[Time/Legends|time]] with her, Dann was called over to the home's wallscreen by Mallatobuck, who was speaking to [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of the Alliance. The trader identified himself as a Rebel [[Agent/Legends|agent]] and promised the Princess that he would look after Chewbacca's family until the Wookiee patriarch arrived home.<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" />\n\n[[File:Hittheroad.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Dann is dismissed from Chewbacca's home.]]\nThe sound of a [[Starship/Legends|starship]] screaming overhead excited the Wookiees, but when they opened the front door, they found two Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] pointing [[E-11 blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]] at them. The [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]],<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" /> along with a [[Unidentified Imperial technician|technician]] and an Imperial [[Unidentified Imperial commander (Blockade of Kashyyyk)|commander]],<ref name=\"EGTC\">''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> entered the home in search of ties to the Rebels. Dann offered his services as a [[Interpreter|translator]] and constructed a tall tale regarding Chewbacca's absence, but the disinterested [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] merely demanded to see his identification. Dann then helped prevent a fight between Mallatobuck and the [[Technician/Legends|technician]] after the latter had his fingers bitten by Lumpawarrump, and was subsequently told by the Commander to leave the home. The trader stalled his departure by showing the technician a performance by a [[Hologram/Legends|holographic]] [[Unidentified Human band|seven-piece Human band]] within the music box, and it took [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]] pointed at him by the stormtroopers to finally convince him to leave.<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" />\n\nLater in the [[Standard day/Legends|day]], Dann returned to the home and found Chewbacca, who was expecting more Imperials to arrive, pointing a [[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcaster]] at him. The search party had earlier departed but had left the stormtrooper [[B4711]] behind to guard the home, and B4711 had subsequently been sent tumbling down to the [[Tree/Legends|forest]] floor by Chewbacca and Solo upon their arrival. Dann's presence calmed Chewbacca down, but an [[Unidentified Imperial officer (wallscreen)|Imperial officer]] appeared on the wallscreen, issuing a general alert for B4711 to answer his [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]]. Dann inserted his identification into the wallscreen and contacted the officer, telling him that the errant stormtrooper had stolen some [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] and fled into the forest. His lie was accepted, and Dann left the home after wishing the relieved Wookiees a happy Life Day.<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" />\n\n===The case of the missing candy===\n{{Quote|I ordered two cases of delicious Life Day candy from Keren on Naboo but they should have been here by now.

While he waited for the shipment to arrive, he visited the public [[Life Day tree]]s in all three cities.<ref name=\"Galaxies\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nWhile at one of the city's trees, Dann grew worried over the lateness of the shipment and enlisted the help of a passing [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] whom he had heard was skilled at problem-solving. The spacer agreed to search for the missing candy and was sent by Dann to speak to the [[Keren Shipping Master|Shipping Master]] of Keren's [[Kwilaan Starport]]. The spacer's investigation led to Tatooine's city of [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] and a confrontation with the stormtrooper [[TK-555]], who had stolen and eaten the candy for himself. When the spacer returned to Dann and revealed the candy's fate, the distraught trader decided to find a replacement gift for the children. He thanked the spacer and remained at the Life Day tree for some time, selling special holiday products.<ref name=\"Galaxies\" />\n\nThe following Life Day, Dann ordered more candy for the children of one of the three cities, which again went missing. After visiting all three Life Day trees, he was greeted by the spacer in front of one of them and asked for assistance one more time. The individual was reluctant to help, suspecting that the same fate had befallen the candy, but nevertheless agreed and set off for Keren's Kwilaan [[Spaceport/Legends|Starport]]. When the spacer returned and confirmed that the candy had once again been eaten by TK-555, a thankful Dann rewarded the individual with one of two prizes: a [[Decorative Fruitcake]] or decorative [[varactyl egg nog]]. While deciding on a suitable replacement gift, Dann again remained at the Life Day tree to hawk his wares.<ref name=\"Galaxies 2\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{C|2009 Life Day Events}}</ref>\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|A pocket-sized aquarium.

He made his way through an Imperial patrol in order to bring them Life Day gifts, including [[Virtual reality|virtual]] [[pornography]] for Attichitcuk, which he covertly slipped to the elderly Wookiee. When Dann entered the home and found Chewbacca pointing a bowcaster at him, he merely smiled and made a wisecrack about feeling welcome. While the Imperial search party was in the home, Dann employed many delaying tactics in an attempt to prevent them from discovering that<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" /> the famous Rebel Chewbacca<ref name=\"EGTC Chewie\" /> was one of the home's residents. Although he was nervous and often reduced to stammering,<ref name=\"Holiday Special\" /> Dann was a quick thinker,<ref name=\"EGTC\" /> and he tried to sell products to the Imperials; offered to cook them food; and distracted them with [[holograph]]ic entertainment, which he made a show of turning on.
