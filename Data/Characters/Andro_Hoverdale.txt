You've been told.|Andro Hoverdale|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Andro Hoverdale''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] conman who lived at the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n[[Standard year/Legends|Years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he hired a young [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[entertainer]] named [[Propti Xaroon]] to entertain him. She was still young and inexperienced, making it easy for Hoverdale to steal all of her belongings, including her family jewelry, [[Identichip/Legends|identity chips]] and all of her [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]].\n\nBy [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], he had become the leader of a group of criminals, the [[Hoverdale bandits]] that operated out of [[Hoverdale's Hideout|a cave]] in the [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooinian]] [[Desert/Legends|desert]]. When a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] seeking Xaroon's endorsement for membership in the [[Azure Cabal]] asked Xaroon for an assignment, she sent the mercenary to Hoverdale to bring back her belongings. The mercenary attacked the bandits and eventually found Xaroon's belongings inside the hideout.\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nBut before the mercenary could take Xaroon's pouch, Hoverdale discovered the intruder and attacked. A fight ensued in which Hoverdale was killed.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAndro Hoverdale was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment's]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011. He was part of the Azure Cabal quest line, which was added to the game with [http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/players/news_archive.vm?id=67250&month=052007 Chapter 6: ''Dangers of the Wild''] in May 2007.\n\nIn the bandits' cave, the player had to kill bandits until a clue to the pouch's location was found. If the player took too long to get the pouch after getting the clue, Hoverdale sent the player a warning. A short time after this warning, Hoverdale appeared near the player and attacked. If the player was quick, it was possible to complete the quest without having to fight and kill Hoverdale.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoverdale, Andro}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
