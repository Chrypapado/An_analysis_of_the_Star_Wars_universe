Listen to them and tremble at my name.|San'sii|Agents of Deception}}\n'''San'sii \"the Kursk\"''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who became the leader of the [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-using organization known as the [[Blackguard (Mustafar)/Legends|Blackguard]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"SWG:ToO\" /> During his time as leader he recruited many non-Force sensitive individuals into the Blackguard, which went against Blackguard tradition<ref name=\"JATM\">''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''</ref>. He along with a large portion of the Blackguard were killed by [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] during the [[Blackguard Purge]].<ref name=\"SWG:ToO\" />\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Sans'siiTheKursk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|San'sii standing alongside another member of the Blackguard]]\nSan'sii was a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who joined the Force-using organization known as the [[Blackguard (Mustafar)/Legends|Blackguard]] prior to or during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. He rose to become the leader of the group, a position known as the [[Kursk]], and became one of its strongest members.<ref name=\"SWG:ToO\" /> Whilst head of the group he felt that the cult was too small in size, and introduced a new rule allowing non-Force sensitive individuals to join to boost numbers. This broke tradition running back to the founding of the group after the [[Seventh Battle of Ruusan]] by the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Vulta Daanat]]. The new troops quickly filled out the Blackguard's ranks and soon became the most visible part of the faction, leading many who encountered the group to believe they were simply a paramilitary organization rather than a Force-using cult.<ref name=\"JATM\" />\n\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]] a [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Archaeology/Legends|archaeologist]] named [[Mi Fon Lu]] wished to research within the [[Southern Jedi Ruins]] in which the Blackguard made their home. However fearing for his safety amongst the Blackguard he hired [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] to clear out the ruins. San'sii was killed along with the rest of the Blackguard in the ruins during what became known as the [[Blackguard Purge]].<ref name=\"SWG:ToO\" />\n\n==Weapons and equipment==\n[[File:San'siiTheKursk2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|San'sii and his underling engaging in a deadly battle against a group of spacers]]\nSan'sii used a [[Color/Legends|Red]] bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] in combat as did most members of the Blackguard, however instead of the normal Blackguard masked uniform San'sii wore the [[Cloak of the Kursk]], a unique robe worn only by the leader of the Blackguard. After his death the cloak was taken by the spacers who killed him.<ref name=\"SWG:ToO\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSan'sii first appeared as an enemy in the MMORPG ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' as part of the [[Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan|Trials of Obi-Wan]] expansion released in [[2005]]. Star Wars Galaxies was shut down on [[December 15]], 2011. In the game he appeared as an elite enemy who players had to kill as part of the quest 'An Archaeologists Problem'. He later received a card in the [[Agents of Deception]] expansion of the [[Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game]] released in [[2009]]. San'sii was also mentioned as the most recent leader of the Blackguard in the [[Wizards of the Coast]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook|Saga Edition]] [[Roleplaying game]] supplement book, the [[Jedi Academy Training Manual]] which also established it was he who introduced the policy of recruiting non-force sensitive as members of the Blackguard.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Trials of Obi-Wan}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Agents_of_Deception#Card_gallery|cardname=San'sii}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=San'sii\n|ru=\u0421\u0430\u043d'\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Blackguards]]\n[[Category:Dark Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mustafar residents]]"}}}]}}}}
