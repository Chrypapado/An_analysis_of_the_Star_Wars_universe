He had the command of ''Dreadnaught-Four'', but had to share this task with the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Justyn Ma'Ning]], who coordinated the Jedi affairs on this ship. The longer the journey lasted, the more authority went to the Jedi, as [[Jorus C'baoth]] demanded more and more liberties. Finally, Omano on D-Four also had no influence on the activities of the Jedi.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']] {{C|Voice only}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Omano\n}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Judicial Forces officers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight residents]]"}}}]}}}}
