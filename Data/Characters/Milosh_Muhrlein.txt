I know every worker here and I can vouch for each one.|Muhrlein defends his staff|Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 1}}\n'''Milosh Muhrlein''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and later the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] during his lifetime. Obtaining the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]] under the Empire, he was put in charge of [[Imperial Research Station 61]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Wayland]]. There, he began selling the technology that his staff developed on the [[Black market/Legends|black market]] as a means of maintaining a luxurious lifestyle that he otherwise could not afford. Muhrlein's shady dealings were eventually [[Mission to Imperial Research Station 61|discovered]] by [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] [[Agent/Legends|Agent]] [[Jahan Cross]], who Muhrlein attempted to bribe into silence. When Muhrlein's efforts failed, he attempted to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Cross, but he was unsuccessful and died in the attempt.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|My record speaks for itself!|Muhrlein tries to deny involvement in the black market|Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 1}}\nMilosh Muhrlein was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from a wealthy family who served the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] against the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name=\"AotE\" /> Following the end of the war in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Muhrlein's services were transferred to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], the Republic's successor state, and he eventually attained the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]] under the Empire. By the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], Colonel Muhrlein had been given [[Commander/Legends|command]] of [[Imperial Research Station 61]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Wayland]] in the [[Mid Rim]]. However, his family's wealth had dried up by that [[Time/Legends|time]], leaving him unable to finance the luxurious lifestyle to which he had become accustomed. To supplement his Imperial pay, Muhrlein began auctioning off experimental technology and [[Droid/Legends|droid]] protocols from his station to the [[Black market/Legends|black market]] in secret, selling to the likes of [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]], [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]], and [[Rossum Droidworks]]. The Droidworks in particular were major clients of the Colonel, gifting him an [[D'ian orchid vine|Orchard vine]] and [[Novanian grog/Legends|Novanian grog]] from the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]] as thanks for the sale of supplies for their [[Iron Eclipse]] [[Computer virus/Legends|computer virus]] project. As a precaution against intruders who might discover his misdeeds, Muhrlein had [[B-2A]] and [[B-2B]], two of the station's newest models of experimental [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droid]], installed in the walls of his office.<ref name=\"AotE\" />\n\nIn 3 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|BBY]], Muhrlein discovered [[Jahan Cross]], an envoy of the [[Imperial Diplomatic Corps]] and an [[Agent/Legends|agent]] of [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]], [[Mission to Imperial Research Station 61|searching]] through the station's files in his office with the aid of the [[Human replica droid]] [[IN-GA 44]]. Despite Muhrlein's protests at the search, Cross continued and accused the colonel of selling goods from the station on the black market, basing his accusations on both evidence from the files and the gifts from Rossum Droidworks, which were too expensive for the commandant to have bought on his own salary. Muhrlein unsuccessfully attempted to bribe the agent, and then ordered his battle droids to attack. IN-GA 44 dispatched the droids while Muhrlein attempted to shoot Cross, defending himself with an updated [[Verpine/Legends|Verpine]] [[Force field/Legends|force field]]. Cross bypassed the field with a pair of devices hidden in the heels of his [[Boot/Legends|boots]], which then released a large electrical surge that [[Death/Legends|killed]] Muhrlein. Muhrlein's family and friends in [[Imperial Court/Legends|Imperial Court]] complained after his death, but despite this Cross began an investigation into the Iron Eclipse project based on his findings in Muhrlein's files.<ref name=\"AotE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Muhrlein_electrocuted.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Muhrlein died by electrocution.]]\n{{Quote|We're both men of the Empire, Cross.

By the time of his death, he had become accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle and was willing to betray the Empire to maintain it. Muhrlein had the foresight to install various defenses in case his treachery was discovered. When his treachery was revealed, he attempted to use bribes to save himself and considered Agent Cross a fool for having principles and not taking the bribe.
