His [[tongue]] was cut out by the [[Crimson Dawn]] syndicate when he and the other villages stood up to them; however, he was still able to maintain an effective silent communications network. In [[10 BBY]], he was present when the [[Cloud-Riders]] and a [[Beckett's gang|group of criminals]] formerly affiliated with Crimson Dawn joined together with the villagers to oppose the syndicate.\n\n==Biography==\nKrysguld Darti was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who lived in a [[Pnakotic Coast village|village]] constructed in the ruins of the [[Bis Refinery]] on the [[Pnakotic Coast]] of his [[homeworld]] [[Savareen]].<ref name=\"SoloOG\" /> Like the other inhabitants of the village, he had had his [[tongue]] cut out by the [[Crimson Dawn]] syndicate after the villagers stood up to the criminals and refused to pay tribute.<ref name=\"Solo\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> He worked as a lookout for the village, keeping an [[eye]] on any approaching [[starship]]s from a beach near the village and gauging whether or not they posed a threat to his community.<ref name=\"SoloOG\" />\n\nWhen Dartis believed danger was coming he would send a tap-code command to the villagers, warning them to hide in burrows and cove shallows until the threat had passed.<ref name=\"SoloOG\" /> In [[10 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]'' dates the events on [[Savareen]] in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' to nine years after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the formation of the Empire to [[19 BBY]], therefore the event on Savareen in ''Solo'' must take place in [[10 BBY]].</ref> he was present in the village when a group of Crimson Dawn affiliates led by the criminal [[Tobias Beckett]] landed in order to process [[coaxium]] they had stolen from the planet [[Kessel]]. He then witnessed the stand-off between the criminals and the [[Cloud-Riders]] gang and aided the two groups when they worked together to defeat the forces of the Crimson Dawn when they arrived on Savareen to collect the coaxium.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKrysguld Dartis had a keen [[eye]] and was able to maintain an effective silent communications network.
