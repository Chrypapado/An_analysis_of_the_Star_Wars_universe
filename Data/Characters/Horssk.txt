This character's skill would depend on those of the player characters and a dice roll. Should the player character compete with this person, Horssk would appear dead soon afterwards, killed by the Cell because the player character could recognize Horssk's name as a Cell member.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[TopWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Trandoshans]]"}}}]}}}}
