Do you know what I see when I look at our family seal? I see a ''goal''&mdash;that perfect circle. We must pull this world together&mdash;we must ''close'' the circle around Telos Four.|Crion, to his son [[Xanatos]]|Jedi\u2014The Dark Side 5}}\n'''Crion''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who was the [[Parent/Legends|father]] of [[Xanatos]] and [[Nason]], the grandfather of [[Granta Omega]], and the corrupt [[Governor of Telos|governor]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Telos IV]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:QuiGonKillsCrionJediTDS5.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Crion dies before Qui-Gon Jinn can save him.]]\n\nCrion was extremely wealthy, being the richest man on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. He let his son [[Xanatos]] go to train as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Over the [[Standard year/Legends|years]], Crion used Telos' resources to create wealth for the planet and quickly ascended to power without help from his [[Advisor/Legends|advisers]] or the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]].\n\nSoon, Crion had the power to launch an attack against neighboring [[Star system/Legends|systems]]. He called for renegotiations with a nearby planet, [[Toprawa/Legends|Toprawa]], but it was really a ruse. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan/Legends|apprentice]] Xanatos [[First Mission to Telos|came]] to supervise. Crion asked his son to join him in his plans. Xanatos sabotaged the first meeting to enrage the Telosian population. Unfortunately for Crion, Qui-Gon revealed what he knew, and the populace rose up against their ruler. A [[Telosian Civil War|civil war]] broke out, and many people died.\n\nDuring this civil war, Crion asked Xanatos to join him. Xanatos accepted, thus failing his final test as a Jedi. Qui-Gon was forced to send his Padawan's father to a fall onto a flaming charcoal bed, turning Xanatos to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. Xanatos picked up his father's burnt [[Ring/Legends|ring]] and pressed it to his right cheek, creating a broken-circle scar which eventually became the symbol of [[Offworld Mining Corporation]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Jedi\u2014The Dark Side]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Dark Rival]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Life and Legend of Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''\n*{{DB|character|quigonjinn|Jinn, Qui-Gon|archivedate=20110208164216}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Crion\n|es=Crion\n|pl=Crion\n|fi=Crion\n}}\n\n[[Category:Galactic Republic governors]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
