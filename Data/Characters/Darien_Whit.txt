After [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] [[Hunt for Jocasta Nu|captured]] [[Jedi]] [[Chief Librarian]] [[Jocasta Nu]], [[Imperial shock trooper]]s of the [[Galactic Empire]] searched Nu and discovered the memory crystal. After Vader analyzed the memory crystal, [[Gender|he]] discovered that it was a list of Force-sensitive children, targets of the former [[Jedi Order]], which included Whit.<ref name=\"Dying Light 10\" />\n\nNu was aware that [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], secretly [[Darth]] Sidious, Vader's [[Sith Master]], was after the list, even when he served as [[Supreme Chancellor]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]], so that he could, as Nu suspected, make more Sith warriors. After Vader killed all shock [[trooper]]s after Nu revealed his former identity, the [[Jedi Knight]] Anakin Skywalker, he then also killed Nu, and informed his master that she had attempted to escape, which resulted in her death. When Palpatine asked Vader if he had recovered any information from Nu, Vader responded that he had learned nothing.<ref name=\"Dying Light 10\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDarien Whit was first mentioned, albeit via their name written in [[Aurebesh]], in the [[2018]] [[canon]] comic, [[Darth Vader (2017) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 10]], written by [[Charles Soule]] and pencilled by [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]].<ref name=\"Dying Light 10\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Vader (2017) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 10]] {{1stm}} {{C|In Aurebesh text}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0414\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d \u0412\u0438\u0442\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Whit, Darien}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]"}}}]}}}}
