When the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] began to force Wookiees into slave labor and hired [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshans]] to [[Hunting/Legends|hunt]] them down, Vargi left Kashyyyk and allied himself with the hunters in an effort to protect his family and to prevent the wholesale slaughter of his people. He directed the Trandoshans' hunts toward elusive Wookiee communities and provided them with other valuable intelligence; when he returned to his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and told his sister, [[Mallatobuck/Legends|Mallatobuck]], what he had done, she reacted with horror and cast him out of her family. Vargi at one point met Mallatobuck's [[Marriage/Legends|husband]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], and the two developed a mutual dislike of each other.\n\nWhen the Empire's Wookiee slave [[Merchant/Legends|trade]] was shut down in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], a [[Nagai]] known as [[Ozrei N'takkilomandrife|Knife]] plotted to revive it and recruited Vargi into his fold. Vargi sought to enslave every member of [[Attichitcuk's family|Chewbacca's family]], and Knife had Mallatobuck; her son, [[Lumpawaroo/Legends|Lumpawarrump]]; and Chewbacca's [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]]; kidnapped. Chewbacca soon returned home from his duties with the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] to visit his family, and he too was captured by Vargi, Knife, and their team of Wookiee outlaws. When Chewbacca's [[Human/Legends|Human]] companion, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], attempted to free his partner, Vargi began to [[Unarmed combat|pummel]] both of them. Chewbacca only fought back when he discovered that his family had been freed, and he overpowered and defeated Vargi. Other Wookiee captives [[Skirmish on Kashyyyk (Nagai invasion)|revolted]], and the attempted revival of the Wookiee slave trade was averted.\n\n==Biography==\n===Betrayer===\n{{Quotetrans|Yesterday, my brother Vargi returned to Kashyyyk.

Vargi learned about their plans and decided to attempt to focus their efforts on specific Kashyyyk communities, which he hoped would prevent wholesale Wookiee slaughter and ensure the safety of his own family. He left his home [[Planet/Legends|planet]] and joined the Trandoshans; Vargi provided the hunters with the locations of secret refuges and elusive Wookiee tribes, which he promised would bring them more enjoyable hunts. He also gave them details on how to invade Wookiee [[City/Legends|cities]] and on certain Wookiee weaknesses that could be exploited. During his time with the hunters, Vargi was believed by Mallatobuck to be either [[Death/Legends|dead]] or enslaved.<ref name=\"EGTAS\" />\n\nAt some point between [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] and [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"EGTAS\" /><ref name=\"Wookiee World\" /> Vargi returned to Kashyyyk.

A lasting animosity developed between the two. Following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|fragmentation]] of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Fleet]] in 4 ABY, Vargi joined forces with the [[Nagai]] [[Ozrei N'takkilomandrife]]&mdash;known to the Wookiees as \"Knife\"&mdash;and plotted to take over the Wookiee slave trade.<ref name=\"Wookiee World\" /> The Nagai were from the satellite [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] [[Firefist]] and had dispatched Knife to distract the [[Alliance of Free Planets]], the government to which Chewbacca and Solo belonged, while the [[Nagai expeditionary force|Nagai fleet]] [[Nagai&ndash;Tof War|invaded]] [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].<ref name=\"The Forgotten War\">''[[The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs]]''</ref> By allying with Knife, Vargi hoped to enslave all of [[Attichitcuk's family|Chewbacca's family]].<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n===Slaver===\n{{Quote|Vargi, cut it out!

When Knife learned of Chewbacca's status as a Wookiee hero, he agreed to have Mallatobuck; her son, [[Lumpawaroo/Legends|Lumpawarrump]]; and Chewbacca's [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]]; kidnapped for use as bait to capture Chewbacca himself. Chewbacca and Solo soon arrived in the city<ref name=\"Wookiee World\" /> of [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]]<ref name=\"Heir\">''[[Heir to the Empire]]''</ref> with their friend [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] for a visit with Chewbacca's family, and Vargi and Knife greeted them on their way to Chewbacca's house. Knife convinced the ignorant newcomers to allow him and Vargi to join them for drinks, and the group made their way to Chewbacca's empty [[Tree/Legends|treetop]] dwelling. Tension mounted between the two Wookiees as the group sat inside and drank, but Vargi's other Wookiee companions soon arrived with Mallatobuck and Lumpawarrump held at [[Blaster/Legends|blasterpoint]] and fitted Chewbacca and his companions with [[stun cuffs]]. Solo and Calrissian were left under guard in the house while Vargi, Knife, and the Wookiee outlaws paraded Chewbacca and his family through the city so as to demoralize any local resistance to the revived slave trade. They then proceeded to a [[Rwookrrorro Spaceport|spaceport]] and began to load groups of Wookiees onto [[Transport/Legends|transports]] to be shipped offworld.<ref name=\"Wookiee World\" />\n\nChewbacca's comrades escaped from their makeshift [[Prison/Legends|prison]]; Solo sneaked up behind Chewbacca and unlocked his stun cuffs but was spotted by Vargi and Knife. Vargi repeatedly [[Unarmed combat|pummeled]] the freed Chewbacca in the face and met no resistance due to Chewbacca's conviction to not place his family in more danger. Solo was pounded next after attempting to protect Chewbacca; in a fit of rage, Chewbacca overpowered Vargi's Wookiee companions and then started to grapple with Vargi himself. Calrissian arrived with Chewbacca's family in tow, and when he realized they were safe, Chewbacca punched and knocked Vargi several [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] away.

He accordingly took steps to protect his own family and to prevent wholesale Wookiee slaughter by allying himself with the Trandoshan hunters who were working for the Empire. Vargi directed the Trandoshans' efforts toward specific hidden communities; however, he also gave the hunters intelligence on Wookiee weaknesses and on how to invade Wookiee cities. Although he attempted to justify his actions to his sister, Mallatobuck was horrified and declared that he was no longer her brother.<ref name=\"EGTAS\" /> Mallatobuck's husband, Chewbacca, also developed a strong dislike of Vargi.<ref name=\"Wookiee World\" />\n\nWhen the Nagai known as Knife came to Kashyyyk with the intention of reviving the planet's slave trade, Vargi joined in his venture.<ref name=\"Wookiee World\" /> Having been cast out of his own family by his sister<ref name=\"EGTAS\" /> and possessed of a grudge against Chewbacca,<ref name=\"Wookiee World\" /> Vargi was intent on capturing and enslaving Chewbacca and every member of his family,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> including Mallatobuck.<ref name=\"Wookiee World\" /> Vargi was a large Wookiee, standing over 2.28 meters tall<ref name=\"height\" /> and sporting a coat of [[Color/Legends|reddish-brown]] [[Hair/Legends|fur]].
