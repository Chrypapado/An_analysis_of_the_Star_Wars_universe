A group led by [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Varias]], including Jornel Savas, [[Officer/Legends|Officers]] [[Hirka]], [[Druno Kener|Kener]] and [[Mener]], and several CorSec troopers, was dispatched from Coronet to investigate. The unit discovered an old and fully automated [[Corellia Droid Factory|droid factory]], presumably built in secret by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] during the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"SWG:TtLV\" /> The CorSec ignored that the factory had been reactivated by [[IG-88A/Legends|IG-88]] for his project of [[Droid Revolution]].<ref name=\"SWG:DtDF\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Disable the Droid Factory|Corellia}}</ref> The droid factory was defended by many battle droids but the Corellian government was reluctant to send reinforcement since it would like to avoid drawing the attention of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"SWG:TtLV\" /> Agent Savas was therefore tasked to recruit independent spacers to assist the CorSec in the factory. He contacted CorSec agent [[Taarna]] who used to work with spacers on [[Talus/Legends|Talus]] and his old friend accepted to help him.<ref name=\"SWG:CtCA\" /> Several spacers later traveled to Corellia to fight the droids and shut down the factory.
