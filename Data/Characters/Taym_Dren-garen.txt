The resulting skirmishes between the Tuskens and settlers kept the Tatooine authorities busy, and unable to focus on Jabba the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] dealings.\n\nDuring the planned execution of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] over the [[Great Pit of Carkoon/Legends|Great Pit of Carkoon]], Skywalker equipped himself with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] previously hidden in the [[Astromech droid/Legends|Astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]]. He began fighting his way through several of Jabba's henchmen, in an attempt to free his friends and himself from Jabba's control.\n\nAfter already witnessing several of his fellow henchmen fall by Skywalker's lightsaber, Dren-garen found the opportunity to disable the attacker. As [[Klaatu/Legends|Klaatu]] retreated into the main hold, Dren-garen erupted from a top-mounted hatch at the front of the deck from behind Skywalker, catching him completely unawares. Dren-garen shot Skywalker's right hand, at the moment Skywalker raised his green-bladed saber above his head. Skywalker struck out at Taym with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], slashing him across his weapon-holding hand. With a howl of pain, Taym Dren-garen fell backwards through the hatch into the depths of the [[Khetanna/Legends|''Khetanna'']].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTaym Dren-garen was portrayed by [[Larry Holt]] in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']]''.
