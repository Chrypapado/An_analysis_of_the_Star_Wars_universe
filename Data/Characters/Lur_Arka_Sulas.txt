May I take a moment of your time for a question?|Sulas asking [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] if he had seen [[Sasha ot Sulem]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Lur Arka Sulas''' was a green-skinned [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] who lived on [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] c. [[3956 BBY]]. He worked for the rancher [[Rundil ot Sulem]], and met an amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] on his visit to the [[Jedi Enclave]] there.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|I represent a human citizen of Dantooine by the name of Rundil ot Sulem. His ranch has had considerable difficulty with Mandalorian raiders for many years.|Lur Arka Sulas|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nSulas worked for the rancher [[Rundil ot Sulem]] of the pastoral [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], serving as an aide and executor. When Rundil's daughter, [[Sasha ot Sulem|Sasha]], was kidnapped by [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] raiders, Sulas was sent to search for her. His search had taken a number of [[Standard year/Legends|years]], and many [[Sentience/Legends|sentients]] had often diverted him away or attempted to take advantage of him for their own greedy reasons. He was at the [[Jedi Enclave]] in [[3956 BBY]]<ref name= \"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> when an amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], along with [[Bastila Shan]] and their party, arrived after fleeing the [[Destruction of Taris|destruction]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. He eventually asked them for help in locating her. Revan told him he didn't know who Sasha was but offered to find her.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nLater, aboard the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' the [[Rutian/Legends|Rutian]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]], [[Mission Vao]], and the exiled [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]], [[Zaalbar]], discovered a shortage of emergency [[Foodstuff/Legends|ration supplies]]. After analyzing the scene, Revan concluded that the culprit must have been a sentient, and not a [[Rodent/Legends|small animal]]. After searching the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] for some time, Revan cornered the stowaway in the ''Ebon Hawk's'' cargo hold. When Revan confronted the stowaway, he discovered them to be a young [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|human]]. The child spoke a strange form of [[Mando'a/Legends|Mando'a]], and Revan quickly suspected that she may have been the child Sulas spoke of. Revan first attempted to communicate with her peculiar language, assuring her that she was safe, and that she would be returned home. Revan returned back to Dantooine, and informed Sulas of the situation. Sulas was initially hesitant to board the ship, due to his previous experiences with [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]]. However, upon learning more about the stowaway, Sulas was sure that they were indeed Sasha. Sulas boarded the ''Ebon Hawk'' and spoke to Sasha, remarking on her linguistic difficulties. While Sasha was hesitant to leave with Sulas, Revan explained to her that she would be safe. Sulas left the ship with Sasha, and returned her to her parents, where he expected her to learn [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic.]]<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf Sulas is not informed about Sasha before the destruction of Dantooine, the main quest, 'Alien Stowaway' cannot be completed.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lur Arka Sulas\n|es=Lur Arka Sulas\n|fi=Lur Arka Sulas\n|pl=Lur Arka Sulas\n|ru=\u041b\u0443\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sulas, Lur Arka}}\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
