A native of Taris, Jelavan was one of five Padawans apprenticed to the five Masters at the Jedi Tower, and he was considered to be one of the most promising of the group. Jelavan was orphaned in an accident that [[Death/Legends|killed]] both his parents in [[3966 BBY/Legends|3966 BBY]], and he used his stipend to support his [[Shel Jelavan|sister]] and [[Shay Jelavan|brother]]. Very talented with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Jelavan was a loyal friend to the other four Padawans in his class. Jelavan was especially close with fellow Human [[Zayne Carrick]], whom he tried to motivate despite Carrick's dubious grasp on the Force. By [[3964 BBY]], Jelavan was close to being named a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], passing his final trial by crossing Taris' dangerous [[rogue moon]] blind. Afterward, the group returned to Taris for a banquet and Knighting ceremony. Little did Jelavan or the other Padawans know, their Jedi Masters were actually part of a secret [[Jedi Covenant]] dedicated to stopping the return of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]&mdash;during the rogue moon test, they had had a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] where a figure they interpreted to be one of their Padawans destroyed the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Feeling the need to quash this threat, the Masters [[Padawan Massacre|murdered]] Jelavan and three of his classmates at their Knighting ceremony. Carrick managed to escape thanks to a late arrival, and was publicly blamed for the massacre.\n\n==Biography==\n===Jedi apprentice===\n{{Quote|Yeah, I don't think ''I'' could sleep with all this bouncin' around.

By then, Jelavan had garnered a reputation as a most promising Jedi prospect, whom Jedi Master [[Lucien Draay]] mentioned in an interview with the ''[[Taris Holofeed]]'' as the type of Padawan that every Master wished they could have.<ref name=\"prime\" /> That [[Standard year/Legends|year]], he and his friends gathered together for what was to be their final test as Jedi Padawans. The five trainees were dropped from a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] onto Taris' [[rogue moon]]&mdash;a [[Planetoid/Legends|planetoid]] in the [[Taris asteroid belt]], perpetually bombarded by thousands of [[meteor]]s an hour&mdash;and were told to traverse the treacherous terrain. Furthermore, they would be wearing [[Enviro-suit|environment suits]] with their [[blast shield]]s down, taking away their physical sight and forcing them to rely solely on [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] for guidance. Jelavan was the first to complete the trial, making it to the Masters' encampment on an overlooking promontory. After the other four Padawans arrived safely, they all returned to Taris. The five Masters cloistered in the Jedi Tower for several days afterward, finally emerging to announce that they had decided who was to become a Jedi, and set up a banquet and ceremony in which their choices would be made known.<ref name=\"kotor4\" />\n\n===Massacre===\n{{Quote|Now, what's going on here?''\"<br />\"''An intervention. For the galaxy.|Shad Jelavan and Q'Anilia, immediately before the massacre|Knights of the Old Republic 6}}\nHowever, unbeknownst to Jelavan and his fellow apprentices, the Masters had a different fate in mind for them. While waiting for their Padawans on the rogue moon, the Masters&mdash;secretly comprising a [[Jedi Covenant]] determined to guard against the return of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]&mdash;had shared vivid [[Force vision/Legends|visions]] of the destruction of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] by a mysterious figure wearing a red environment suit, identical to the ones the Padawans were wearing at the time. Taking that to mean that one of their apprentices was the destroyer, the Covenant resolved to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the Padawans in a preemptive strike.<ref name=\"kotor5\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 5|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 5]]</ref> Afterward, while cloistered in the Tower, they had time to think of a cover story. Jelavan was to be the scapegoat&mdash;the Covenant would tell the public that Jelavan, denied Knighthood due to his headstrong attitude, flew into a rage and slew the other four Padawans, before being killed by the Masters.<ref name=\"kotor6\" />\n\n[[File:WhatTheHeck.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shad Jelavan lies dead with his friends, as Zayne Carrick looks on.]]\nAt the banquet, Jelavan arrived with his siblings, and hobnobbed with his friends. Carrick showed up late, crashing through a window and breaking a caterer's table, and was ordered to pay for the damages by his Master, Lucien Draay. Jelavan gave Carrick the [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]] to cover the cost, over Carrick's protests. Later, the group retired to the Masters' chamber, where they were to learn their fates.<ref name=\"kotor1\" /> Jelavan made it to the chamber late, having walked his brother and sister home. When he arrived, he found that Carrick was also late, and the ceremony was yet to begin. However, Jelavan quickly deduced that something was amiss. The Masters all had their [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] out, contrary to custom, something they explained away as part of the ceremony. However, Lucien Draay also had his, implying that Carrick was to be Knighted. Initially overjoyed that Carrick was to be Knighted, Jelavan's happiness turned to suspicion&mdash;although he and Carrick were close friends, Jelavan did not believe he would be promoted to Jedi Knight, as the bumbling apprentice always finished last in every test. The other Padawans followed his lead, and Jelavan, perturbed by the Masters' halfhearted lies, finally asked Lucien Draay directly what was going on. The Masters responded by [[Padawan Massacre|slaughtering]] Jelavan and the other Padawans,<ref name=\"kotor6\" /> with Jelavan falling to the blade of his Master, Q'Anilia.<ref name=\"kotor23\" /> Carrick arrived a moment later, and managed to escape.<ref name=\"kotor1\" /> The murders were pinned on Carrick, and large [[Bounty/Legends|bounties]] were placed on him and an \"accomplice,\" local [[Snivvian/Legends|Snivvian]] hood [[Marn Hierogryph]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\nThe bodies of Jelavan and his friends were carried away by [[Medical droid/Legends|medical droids]]. The story of the massacre became a huge news focus on Taris, and [[Hologram/Legends|holograms]] of Jelavan and his class,<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> dubbed the \"Taris Four\" by the media,<ref name=\"cswe\" /> could be found as far deep as the [[Lower City]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> Jelavan and his friends were publicly mourned some [[Time/Legends|time]] afterward, with the Masters of the Covenant speaking kindly of them at the funerals.<ref name=\"kotor9\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 9|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 9]]</ref> The [[3963 BBY|year]] after the murders, [[Raana Tey]], Kamlin's Master, had a nightmarish vision where Jelavan and his Jedi class took the place of the Jedi Covenant, and she took the place of Zayne Carrick, walking in on the murders of her fellow Masters. In her dream, Jelavan wielded a red lightsaber, such as those used by the Sith.<ref name=\"kotor16\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 16|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 16]]</ref> Jelavan's sister Shel was devastated by his death&mdash;during the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Taris Siege|siege]] of Taris in 3963 BBY, Raana Tey exploited this grief in order to use her in an attempt to kill Zayne Carrick, who was on the planet working with the [[Taris Resistance]]. Shel was to attack Carrick with Jelavan's old lightsaber, which was held in a storage room of the Jedi Tower. However, Shel learned the truth and turned on Tey, stabbing her with Jelavan's lightsaber before the mad Jedi Master was killed in a massive explosion shortly afterward.<ref name=\"kotor24\" /> [[Xamar]], Gharn's Master, would later confess to the murders to the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] and clear Carrick's name,<ref name=\"kotor32\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 32|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 32]]</ref> and Shel eventually joined Carrick's [[Rogue Moon Project]], an organization dedicated to helping refugees, wrongly accused fugitives and the like.<ref name=\"kotor48\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 48|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 48]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Zayne's a great guy&mdash;and we all like him and try to help him out. But he's no Jedi.|Shad Jelavan|Knights of the Old Republic 6}}\nDespite his considerable talent with the Force, Jelavan remained a loyal friend to his classmates. Jelavan was especially close with Zayne Carrick, whom he often tried to motivate despite Carrick's shortcomings as a Jedi prospect. Believing that [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] needed more Jedi Knights regardless of skill level, Jelavan urged Carrick to work hard, and even tried to lift his friend's spirits by claiming that Carrick was actually trying to lull the other Padawans into a false sense of security.<ref name=\"cswe\" /> Although Jelavan did all he could to help Carrick and deeply wanted him to become a Jedi Knight, he did not think that Carrick could be a Jedi, and certainly did not think that the Jedi Masters would ever grant him Knighthood. Jelavan was generous with his money, routinely using his stipend to support his sister and brother,<ref name=\"kotor6\" /> and giving Carrick all the money he had to pay for a destroyed table at their banquet.<ref name=\"kotor1\" /> Despite this, Jelavan had quite a rebellious and defiant streak in him, and, possessing good insight, was not afraid to question the Jedi Masters when a situation did not seem right to him. In fact, Jelavan's headstrong attitude was part of the Jedi Covenant's original cover story for the Padawan massacre.<ref name=\"kotor6\" /> Jelavan had light skin, [[Color/Legends|blond]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]]&mdash;worn in a [[Padawan braid/Legends|Padawan braid]]&mdash;and blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"kotor1\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Shad always won, of course.
