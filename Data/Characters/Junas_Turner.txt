He was a brash idealist, who often would get into messy situations and somehow always managed to get out of them again with an upper hand.\n\n==Biography==\nBefore joining the Alliance, he was a [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] trader and therefore a natural for reconnaissance missions, which became his specialty when working for the Rebellion. He would take full advantage of his skills and his luck and was often successful on his missions.\n\nOn an unsuccessful mission to [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] to investigate the Imperial [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II]] project, he was attacked by a [[Yootak]]. However [[Grael]] the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] saved his life. Soon after, they were both captured by the Empire and sent to the [[Droid/Legends|droid]]-administered prison facility on the [[Balis-Baurgh]] space station. Here he met up with two other Rebels, [[Becker]] and [[Lon]], and developed a friendship with Grael. Junas and Grael eventually escaped the prison colony and made it back to Endor just in time for the celebrations of the destruction of the second Death Star.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|1|Escape from Balis-Baurgh}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|\"Balis-Baurgh system\" entry}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Junas Turner\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Junas}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance Military officers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]"}}}]}}}}
