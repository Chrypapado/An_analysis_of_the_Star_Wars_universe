She owned a [[T-16 skyhopper/Legends|T-16 skyhopper]] and had a reputation among her friends as a hot-shot pilot who would sometimes exaggerate things for effect. On one occasion when she was 17, she was flying the skyhopper down a canyon, when she crashed it as a result of what she claimed to be an attack by intelligent [[Womp rat/Legends|womp rats]]. According to her story, they strung up a wire across the canyon, which she flew into and crashed on top of a rock. A number of womp rats armed with pieces of metal tried to climb up and get her, but she shot off a flare and her father rescued her before they could reach her.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030130womprat|text=Genius Womp Rat|int=Genius Womp Rat|archivedate=20030201205219}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Loquoy, Jent}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
