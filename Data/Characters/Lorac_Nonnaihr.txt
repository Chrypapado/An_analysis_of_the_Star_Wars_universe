Employing mostly offworlders on semi-permanent visas and based out of the [[Aldera/Legends|capital city's]] [[Spacer Quarter]], the operation took orders via proxy and received payment from their customers up front, who then traveled to [[Belgaroth]] to pick up the weapons. Nonnaihr strictly forbid any of his clients from using his merchandise anywhere in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]], and rarely involved himself in person with any related negotiations. When he did, he employed a [[Shadowcloak (disguise)/Legends|shadowcloak]] and a [[Disruption Bubble Generator|bubble generator]] to help protect his identity and conceal any evidence of his illegal activities. But despite these countermeasures, his operation was eventually rooted out by freelance investigators hired by the highly-placed Alderaanian official [[Tor Aramatha]]. Lorac Nonnaihr was living on Alderaan at the time of its [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nonnaihr, Lorac}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
