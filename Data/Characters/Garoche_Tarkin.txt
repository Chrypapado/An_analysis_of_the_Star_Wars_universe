A scion of the wealthy and influential [[Tarkin family/Legends|Tarkin family]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]], Garoche was the son of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]]. Shortly before his disappearance around [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Garoche had reached the rank of [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] and was in command of a [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|The vessel is under the command of this man...Admiral Garoche Tarkin...my son.|Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to Darth Vader|Darth Vader and the Lost Command 1}}\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, then-[[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]], Garoche Tarkin enlisted into a military academy, thus also keeping in tradition with his [[Tarkin family/Legends|family's]] strong support for military service. While training at the Academy, he befriended his rival and fellow cadet [[Shale]]. By [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], he was serving the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] as an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] and commanding officer of a [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]].<ref name=\"DVLC1\">[[Darth Vader and the Lost Command 1|''Darth Vader and the Lost Command'' 1]]</ref>\n\nBarely after the fall of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] and the rise of the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], Admiral Tarkin was tasked with eliminating insurgents in the [[Ghost Nebula]]. However, the mission had apparently been a failure, resulting in the disappearance of both the admiral and his vessel. In order to find and retrieve his missing son, Grand Moff Tarkin requested the aid of [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Much to the dismay of Tarkin, however, the Emperor's [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] was tasked with the mission to find Garoche. In the event that Vader became distracted from his primary objective, as had happened in the past when faced with hunting down [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] fugitives, Tarkin attached [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] Shale to the mission.<ref name=\"DVLC1\" />\n\nIn actuality, Garoche defected to Atoa in part due to a deep resentment of the atrocities he had to commit in the name of Palpatine, and aided in its insurgency after the Lady [[Saro]], High Priestess of Atoa, forgave him for his crimes. The pair became lovers, and Saro conceived his child. Captain Shale had followed him into defection, with the former seeking to kill Lord Vader, but failed and ended up dead. He later appeared with Saro after the latter removed the ghostly image of [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], Vader's wife. Garoche and Saro then persuaded for Vader to repent of his sins. Vader ultimately killed them both in an attempted [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] by [[Ambush on the Atoan crystal planet|collapsing the cathedral]] they were in to atone for his sins as Vader. However, he ultimately survived, blaming Garoche's death on the Atoan Insurgents, part of a plan with the Emperor to deepen Wilhuff Tarkin's hatred and make him a better tool of the Empire.<ref name=\"DVLC5\" />\n\n===After death===\nTrue to Palpatine's plans, Garoche's death led to his father committing genocide against the Atoans as revenge for their perceived part in his demise.\n\nUltimately, however, Garoche and Shale would prove to not be the only Imperials disgusted with having to commit several atrocities in the Emperor's name. The Imperial Academy headmaster, Gentis, would orchestrate a military coup against Palpatine shortly afterwards in order to stop him and his warmongering ways.<ref name=\"DVGP\">''[[Star Wars: Darth Vader and the Ghost Prison]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Vader and the Lost Command 1|''Darth Vader and the Lost Command'' 1]] {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n*[[Darth Vader and the Lost Command 2|''Darth Vader and the Lost Command'' 2]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Darth Vader and the Lost Command 4|''Darth Vader and the Lost Command'' 4]]\n*[[Darth Vader and the Lost Command 5|''Darth Vader and the Lost Command'' 5]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Garoche Tarkin\n|es=Garoche Tarkin\n|pl=Garoche Tarkin\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0448 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarkin, Garoche}}\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy admirals of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Tarkin family]]"}}}]}}}}
