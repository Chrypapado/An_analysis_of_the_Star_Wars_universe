In turn, Lankin provided Tount with [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] to keep control over Rintonne. Governor Tount kept the population scared to prevent any open rebellion against him. He also restricted the freedoms of the civilian population. [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] wanted to overthrow Tount and offered a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] for him.\n\nTount was a fat [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] with a moustache, and a capable bureaucrat who kept information under control.

Tount became an official of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] of [[Rintonne/Legends|Rintonne]], a [[Planet/Legends|planet]] in the strategic [[Lambda sector/Legends|Lambda sector]]. Governor Tount was a subordinate of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Par Lankin]], who ruled over the whole sector. During the peak of the Empire, Lankin provided Tount with [[Imperial Army/Legends|Army]] [[Soldier/Legends|troops]] and [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] that Tount used to retain power over the planet.<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\nTount extinguished individual freedoms over the civilian population of Rintonne, began a state of martial law and monitored any incoming traffic. He kept an strict control over information: In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] was killed, shaking the whole Empire, and the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] was created; but the population of Rintonne was unaware of this fact. Tount, on the contrary, did know of the New Republic: He helped Lankin raiding several Republic planets, succeeding in the conquest of three of those.<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\n[[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] had Tount in its sights, offering a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] of {{Cr}}35,000 for his capture. They also sent several undercover agents to [[Spy/Legends|spy]] him.<ref name=\"WBC\" /> When [[Victor Grieves]], a former [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]] specialist, was seen in the [[Rintonne system]], he was suspected to be working for Governor Tount.<ref name=\"HR\">''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''</ref> By [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], the Intelligence report on Tount specified that he had scared the civilian population so much that they were too afraid to rebel because they saw no chance of victory. However, Intelligence analysts believed that Tount's defeat could trigger a chain reaction that would free the whole Lambda sector.<ref name=\"WBC\" /> Soon afterward, the Lambda sector stopped being an Imperial pocket kingdom.<ref name=\"A\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Independent? Half of those bloody headhunters aren't even housebroken!|Governor Serdif Tount, on independent bounty hunters|Galaxy Guide 10: Bounty Hunters}}\nIn 7 ABY, Tount was an overweight, forty-two-year-old man. He sported a moustache and carried with him a walking stick that he could use as a club. A learned man, he was an expert in bureaucracy, specialized in the government of the Lambda sector, and even more in the administration of Rintonne. He was also familiar with the Imperial legislation. He had leadership skills particularly honed to give orders to his soldiers. He also knew how to ride [[Niorven stable mount]]s.<ref name=\"WBC\" /> Like other Imperial [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucrats]], Tount was known to despise the independent [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], as opposed to Imperial-aligned bounty hunters or members of the [[Bounty Hunters' Guild/Legends|Bounty Hunters' Guild]].<ref name=\"GG\">''[[Galaxy Guide 10: Bounty Hunters]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSerdif Tount first appeared in [[Bill Smith]]'s ''[[Wanted by Cracken]]'' ([[1993]]), a [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying guide]] published by [[West End Games]].
