He was somewhat tall for his [[Species/Legends|species]] and had deep gray fur with hints of light gray around his face and throat, signifying his age.\n\n==Biography==\nEbrihim was direct and plainspoken, even undiplomatic at times. Although dour and serious by [[Human/Legends|Human]] standards, Ebrihim was considered adventurous and flighty by his fellow [[Drall (planet)|Drall]]. He preferred a life of [[Planet/Legends|planet]]-hopping and scholarship. His interests, however, spanned the sciences, history, mysticism, and literature. He was something of a dilettante.\n\nWhen the [[House of Solo|Solo family]] arrived on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] for a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] trade summit, Ebrihim was hired as a tutor for the Solo children. [[Leia Organa Solo]] sought a non-Human tutor who could expose them to an alien viewpoint, and, as Ebrihim himself noted, he was the same height as the children and not likely to intimidate them unless he wished to. Ebrihim also served as guide to the Solo family and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and took them on an archaeological tour.\n\nAt the onset of the [[Corellian Crisis|First Corellian Insurrection]], Ebrihim was looking after the Solo children at [[Corona House/Legends|Corona House]] when the building was targeted by agents of the [[Human League]]. Bombs rocked the structure, destroying many of the lower floors. Han Solo escaped with NRI agent [[Belindi Kalenda]], while Leia was trapped with Governor-General [[Micamberlecto]]. The children were on the upper floors and were forced to retreat to the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Ebrihim and Chewbacca, leaving their parents behind. On Ebrihim's advice, the ''Falcon'' fled to his aunt's home on [[Drall (planet)|Drall]]. There the children remained for their safety.\n\n[[File:Ebrihim_CTD.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Ebrihim.]]\n\nEbrihim's life of study and adventure precluded settling down and raising a family, which was very unusual for a Drall. His Aunt [[Marcha]] theorized that his affection for the children he tutored was a kind of substitute for the children he would never have. When Marcha became [[Governor|governor-general]] of the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]], he became her aide.\n\nHe owned the eccentric droid [[Q9-X2]], who was obsessed with making modifications and enhancements to himself. Ebrihim tried his best to teach Q9 manners and etiquette, but the droid still tended to butt into conversations and make carelessly blunt comments.\n\nEbrihim had a somewhat practical view of the Force for a non-Force sensitive, regarding it as actually there and expressing a belief in it, but not troubling himself over it. To him, the Force was something that was inaccessible and as a result made him view it as something to simply not take seriously.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Ambush at Corellia]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Assault at Selonia]]''\n*''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*{{FFCite|119|Q9X1-2, ''Q9-X2''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ebrihim\n|ru=\u042d\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0438\u043c\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Drall]]\n[[Category:Educators]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
