In [[3956 BBY]], he was stationed on [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]], where he passed the time getting drunk and spending his time with the ladies that he likes to see. While he doesn't hide his distaste for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] and Manaan, he doesn't seem as uptight as other Sith officers, remarking that he just wants to \"have a couple of drinks and try to unwind.\"\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the game, Viglo will only converse with the player if [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] is a [[Gender/Legends|female]]. If Revan is a man, Viglo tells the male Revan to back off because he's \"cramping his style with the ladies\". Upon closing the conversation as a female Revan, he will make a drunken attempt to flirt before requesting another drink from the [[Selkath/Legends|Selkath]] barkeep.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Viglo\n|fi=Viglo\n|pl=Viglo\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u0433\u043b\u043e\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Military officers of Revan's Sith Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
