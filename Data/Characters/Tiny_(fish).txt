[[Teebo/Legends|Teebo]] claimed that this fish might be the cousin of his [[Teebo's fish friend|other fish friend]]. When the Ewoks were preparing to leave the [[Coral Castle]], Teebo summoned his small fish friend so that he would create them a bubble to get back to the surface. However, his summons brought \"Tiny\", a much larger fish. Although Teebo was surprised to see this other fish, he surmised that the two must have been related, and he allowed \"Tiny\" to create them a bubble so that they could return to the surface. After helping the Ewoks, \"Tiny\" departed as quickly as he had arrived.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Ewoks|The Tragic Flute}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]"}}}]}}}}
