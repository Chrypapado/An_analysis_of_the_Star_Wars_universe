It also states that the plan was orchestrated by Jennica Pierce of the Rebel Alliance.  This scenario does not occur if the player aligns with the Empire, so it can be deduced that Saponza's gang joined the Rebellion.</ref>\n**[[Tatooine rebel cell]]<ref name=\"Gameplay\" />\n|masters=\n|apprentices=}}\n{{Quote|Been awhile since you've been on Tatooine with your old partner Saponza.

He claimed to have taken part in the [[Mytaranor Campaign]], writing it in his experience section in the [[Undervine]] network.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref>\n\nAt some point between the [[Battle of Yavin]] and the [[Battle of Hoth]], Saponza and [[Saponza's partner|his partner]] established a base of operations in the former's [[Saponza's homestead|Tatooinian homestead]]. The two mercenaries soon attracted the wrath of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]], the resident [[Hutt]] crime lord of Tatooine. [[Bib Fortuna]], Jabba's chief of staff, contacted him and his companion several times, and even though he warned them about Jabba's revenge, they still ignored it, possibly believing Jabba would forget or simply not bother. In retaliation for the [[death]] of six of his henchmen, Jabba had Saponza's homestead razed to the ground. Realizing that they could not defeat the Hutt on their own, Saponza and his partner were forced to pick a side in the [[Galactic Civil War]]<ref name=\"Gameplay\" /> and chose to join the freedom fighters of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name=\"Starwars.com\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAt the time of the Galactic Civil War, Saponza was an older, yet broad-shouldered human sporting [[Color|white]] [[hair]].<ref name=\"Gameplay\" /> He was outwitted by Bib Fortuna, and did not believe Jabba would bother to seek revenge. He did dispatch six of Jabba's henchmen however and was skilled with a blaster, despite being slightly weak minded.<ref name=\"Gameplay\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSaponza ({{Pronounced|s\u0259.\u02c8p\u00e6n.z\u0259}}) was created for ''[[Star Wars: Commander]]'', a [[2014]] mobile strategy [[Video game|game]] by [[Disney Interactive]].
