By the time of the war's height, he was the head of Exchange operations on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], where he kept [[Davik Kang's estate|his estate]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins===\nIt was implied by [[Zelka Forn]]'s [[Gurney (Human)|assistant]] that Kang originally grew up in the [[Lower City]] and lived in poverty along with the [[Non-huMan|non-Humans]], unlike most Humans of Taris. He had a large majority of non-Human [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], most notably [[Rodian/Legends|Rodians]]. At some point he became the leader of the [[Exchange]] on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. After he came to power he became owner of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''.\n\n===As the Exchange leader on Taris===\nKang employed dozens of [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] and enforcers to keep Taris under his unofficial control, most notably the former [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Canderous Ordo]] and the bounty hunter [[Calo Nord]]. Kang collected the stuffed heads of ferocious creatures hunted and killed by Nord, but his most prized possession was his smuggling vessel, the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''. Kang resented the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith presence]] on Taris because their planet-wide blockade had halted his inter-galactic operations, but he knew well enough to avoid bothering them.\n\n===During the Sith occupation===\nAfter rescuing [[Bastila Shan]] from the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]], the former [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] (whose identity was secret) was approached by Ordo, who offered Revan the chance to leave Taris, provided he could retrieve the necessary planetary launch codes from a nearby Sith military base. Revan agreed to steal the codes in return for Ordo convincing Kang to hire Revan as another mercenary. The situation was beneficial for both Revan and Ordo, and the two worked together to steal the ''Ebon Hawk''. Revan and his companions made their escape while his former [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]], [[Darth Malak]], began [[Destruction of Taris|bombarding the city]] into dust from orbit.\n\n===Fate===\n{{Quote|Damn those Sith, they're bombing the whole planet! I knew they'd turn on us sooner or&hellip;well, look what we got here! Thieves in the hangar.|Davik Kang|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nOutraged at the treachery of both Canderous Ordo and Revan, Kang and Calo Nord attempted to stop Revan from stealing his ship; however, they underestimated the amnesiac Dark Lord and Kang was killed. Nord, realizing he was outgunned, pulled out a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] and hoped he would take Revan and his friends with him. When Kang's estate was again directly hit by Malak's laser blasts, the hangar nearly collapsed, trapping Nord under the wreckage. He escaped to attack Revan again later, but Davik's estate along with the rest of Taris was destroyed by the [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]].\n\n==Equipment==\nKang's [[Davik's war suit|powerful battle suit]] was a legend in itself. Rumor had it that it was so incredible, being light and flexible yet extremely durable, that Kang decided to kill the ingenious technician who constructed it, assuring that no one had a suit of a similar design. He also possessed a [[Davik's Visor|prototype visor]] that gave the wearer improved facility with [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]]. The crime lord was eventually stripped of these items by Revan before the ''Ebon Hawk'' escaped from the collapsing city-planet.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Revan'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Codex}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook]]'' <!--p.209-->\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|davikkang|Davik Kang|Kang, Davik|archivedate=20100414090314}}\n*{{DB|starship|ebonhawk|Ebon Hawk|archivedate=20100327213645}}\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=Owner of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''\n|years=&mdash;[[3956 BBY]]\n|before=[[Ahita Othar]]\n|after=[[Revan/Legends|Revan]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Davik Kang\n|es=Davik Kang\n|hu=Davik Kang\n|nl=Davik Kang\n|pl=Davik Kang\n|pt=Davik Kang\n|ru=\u0414\u044d\u0432\u0438\u043a \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0433\n|fi=Davik Kang\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kang, Davik}}\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
