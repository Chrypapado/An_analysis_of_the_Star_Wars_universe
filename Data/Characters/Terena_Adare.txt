I bet she'd make a decent Senator even.|Militia Captain Zherron, about Administrator Adare|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Terena Adare''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who had been the Agricultural Administrator of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]] up until that [[Planet/Legends|world]] was [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|sacked]] by forces of the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] under the command of [[Darth Malak]]. In the wake of the invasion, occupation and eventual departure of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], she became the leader of the surviving colonists, with the seat of government established within the outpost at [[Khoonda]], which had been the former home of [[Ahlan Matale]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[Darth Malak]]'s [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|devastation of Dantooine]] in [[3956 BBY]] badly damaged the [[Jedi Enclave]], eliminating the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] presence on the planet. After the attack, Adare worked hard to ensure the survival of what was left of the settlers. She sat upon [[Khoonda]], a government tasked with protecting the settlers and regulating their day-to-day affairs&mdash;a task formerly entrusted to the Jedi&mdash;and was proclaimed the Administrator.\n\nRealizing that the [[Khoonda Militia|militia corps]] alone was not enough to ensure Khoonda's safety, Adare secretly maintained contacts with Jedi Master [[Vrook Lamar]], a former member of the [[Dantooine Enclave Council]] and a friend for many years. Unlike most settlers, she trusted the Jedi, remembering the good they had done when the Enclave had stood firmly. However, she understood that the Jedi in general had an extremely bad reputation on Dantooine, and even she could do nothing about it.\n\nThe opportunity to change that fact came in [[3951 BBY]], the year when relations between the settlers and [[Azkul]]'s [[Exchange]] mercenaries grew especially tense. Unbeknownst to Adare, the mercenaries captured Vrook, preparing to transport him to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] to claim [[G0-T0|Goto's]] bounty. It was at this time that [[Meetra Surik]] arrived on Dantooine, looking for Vrook, and the Administrator granted her the permission to search the ruins of the Enclave. In turn, Surik agreed to help the settlers in any way possible.\n\nEventually, the Exile's investigation, during which Master Vrook was freed from the mercenaries, triggered an open conflict between them and Khoonda, leading to the [[Battle of Khoonda]], when the mercenaries attempted to infiltrate Khoonda and kill Adare. During the conflict, Surik significantly contributed to the defenses of Khoonda and, along with Vrook, bravely fought the mercenaries, restoring the settlers' faith in the Jedi.\n\nAfter the battle, as Dantooine's safe and prosperous future was secured, Adare did her best to ensure that the deeds of Vrook and Surik, and the heritage of the Jedi, would not be forgotten.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTerena Adare was introduced in the computer and video game ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', in which she was voiced by [[Carolyn Seymour]].\n\nIf the player chooses the alternate [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] path throughout the game, then Meetra Surik will lend her aid to the mercenaries in their assault on Khoonda, during which Adare is killed by Azkul. Following this, the planet falls under the control of the Exchange.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|terenaadare|Adare, Terena|archivedate=20100327222431}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Terena Adare\n|ru=\u0422\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adare, Terena}}\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
