Marl's career spanned nearly twenty [[Standard year/Legends|years]], and by [[3956 BBY]], he became the dueling champion after the retirement of [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]]. However, he was eventually defeated by the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Twitch (Rodian)|Twitch]] for the title of champion.

He still competed with other duelists, such as [[Ice (duelist)|Ice]], [[Gerlon Two-Fingers]], and [[Deadeye Duncan]]. During his career, Marl made the decision to use a [[Vibro double-blade|double-bladed vibrosword]] during combat after Two-Fingers' [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] overheated and exploded, paralyzing three of his [[Limb/Legends|fingers]].<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nIn 3956 BBY, the final [[Standard year/Legends|year]] of the [[Jedi Civil War]] between the Republic and the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] Empire,<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> the [[Republic soldier]]<ref name=\"EGTTF: DLJh\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']] {{C|Entry from [[Deesra Luur Jada]]'s [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]]}}</ref><ref>''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', Revan's position in the Republic army is revealed in the second conversation with Carth Onasi regarding his background.</ref> [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], known by the nickname \"[[Mysterious Stranger]]\" after defeating Duncan, Two-Fingers, and Ice to ascend the ranks of duelist, challenged Marl.

When the Sith forces of [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Malak invaded and quarantined Taris, Marl did not care, so long as they did not ban the arena. He regarded Bendak Starkiller as a legend, albeit [[Blood/Legends|bloodthirsty]], and respected all the other duelists excluding Deadeye Duncan, whom he believed was the worst duelist ever.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nThe veteran duelist never fought with blasters, preferring the use of a [[Vibro double-blade|double-bladed vibrosword]], a decision he made after fellow duelist Gerlon Two-Fingers' blaster exploded&mdash;which, according to Marl, was a rare occurrence. When Revan defeated him in their duel, Marl made it a point to congratulate him and wished the soldier well in the sport as he decided to retire due to his age. Marl was light-skinned, with [[Color/Legends|gray]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and [[Hair/Legends|hair]], and wore a [[combat suit]].<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMarl appeared in the [[2003]] [[Xbox]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', developed by [[BioWare]]. He was mentioned in the game's [[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|official strategy guide]] and the ''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''. This article was written under the assumption that Revan defeated Marl. However, in ''Knights of the Old Republic'', the player can elect to not participate in the dueling arena, which led to Revan never dueling Marl.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''<!-- p.46 -->\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Taris/Legends|Taris]] Dueling Champion<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n|years=[[3956 BBY]]<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />\n|before=Eventually [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]]<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n|before-years=&ndash;3956 BBY<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n|after=[[Twitch (Rodian)|Twitch]]<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n|after-years=3956 BBY&ndash;<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n}}\n{{End_box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Marl#legends\n|es=Marl\n|pl=Marl\n|ru=\u041c\u0430\u0440\u043b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Duelists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
