Gulfel came to the attention of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] authorities, who had him [[Death/Legends|killed]] outside [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] sometime after [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:XoronGulfel.jpg|250px|thumb|Randomly generated depictions of Xoron Gulfel]]\nXoron Gulfel was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]], prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]]. Due to the nature of many older [[W:c:swg:Quest|quests]] in ''Star Wars Galaxies'', the [[Species/Legends|species]], gender, and appearance of Gulfel changed each time a player performed this quest. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the [[canon]]ical species of Gulfel, which could have included any number of [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] species, such as [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] and [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]]. However, the quest dialogue given by [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]] identified Gulfel as a male.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gulfel, Xoron}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
