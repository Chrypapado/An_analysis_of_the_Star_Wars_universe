After [[Darth]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Vader]] [[Hunt for Jocasta Nu|captured]] [[Jedi]] [[Chief Librarian]] [[Jocasta Nu]], [[Imperial shock trooper]]s of the [[Galactic Empire]] searched Nu and discovered the memory crystal. After Vader analyzed the memory crystal, [[Gender|he]] discovered that it was a list of Force-sensitive children, targets of the former [[Jedi Order]], which included Hvitur.<ref name=\"Dying Light 10\" />\n\nNu was aware that [[Darth Sidious]], under the alias of [[Galactic Emperor]] Sheev Palpatine, Vader's [[Sith Master]], was after the list, even when he served as [[Supreme Chancellor]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]], so that he could, as Nu suspected, make more Sith warriors. After Vader killed all shock [[trooper]]s after Nu revealed his former identity, the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], he then also killed Nu and informed his master that she had attempted to escape, which resulted in her death. When Sidious asked Vader if he had recovered any information from Nu, Vader responded that he had learned nothing.<ref name=\"Dying Light 10\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDevin Hvitur's name written in [[Aurebesh]] was first mentioned in the [[2018]] [[canon]] comic, [[Darth Vader (2017) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 10]], written by [[Charles Soule]] and pencilled by [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]].<ref name=\"Dying Light 10\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Vader (2017) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 10]] {{1stm}} {{C|In Aurebesh text}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d \u0425\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hvitur, Devin}}\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]"}}}]}}}}
