The con-artist [[Flim]], disguised as [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], was also involved in the negotiations, providing the appearance of confident leadership necessary to make Paloma consider the otherwise unthinkable alliance. Disra and Tierce were aware that [[Garm Bel Iblis]] planned an information raid on the [[Ubiqtorate/Legends|Ubiqtorate]] base on Yaga Minor for a copy of the Caamas Document, and timed the meeting to occur just as his assault commenced, in the hopes that it would prove to D'asima that the Remnant was a serious contender for ultimate controller of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Ultimately, however, the meeting was interrupted by the timely arrival of [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]], who revealed Disra's shady financial connections, Tierce's [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] heritage, and \"Grand Admiral Thrawn's\" true identity, destroying the alliance before it even began.\n\nSeeing how close she had come to allying the Eleven, and the Mistryl, with a con man, D'asima reluctantly acknowledged [[Shada D'ukal]]'s role in averting the disaster, and agreed to lift the death warrant issued against her, although Shada's exile from [[Emberlene]] remained permanent.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Paloma D'asima\n|fi=Paloma D'asima\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:D'asima, Paloma}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Legislators and councilors]]\n[[Category:Mistryl]]"}}}]}}}}
