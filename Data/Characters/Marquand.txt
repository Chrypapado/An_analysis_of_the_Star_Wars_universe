He served as [[Major/Legends|Major]] in the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]]. He was the pilot of one of the [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-ATs]] in the complement of the [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']] and later pilot of the [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]], [[Tempest Scout 2]] during the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. During this time he was accompanied by gunner [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Watts]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the Battle of Endor, [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and two [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] landed on Tempest Scout 2, with one of them appearing in the [[Walker/Legends|walker]]'s view ports, taunting the pilots. Marquand ordered Watts to get it off their AT-ST.<ref name=\"ROJ\" />\n\nWatts peered out of the cockpit hatchway and was pulled out by the powerful Chewbacca, who threw him overboard. The two Ewoks then entered the cockpit and mercilessly beat Marquand unconscious, taking control of the walker and turning its guns on another AT-ST, destroying it.<ref name=\"ROJ\" /> Midway through the tides' turn, the Imperials became privy to Tempest Scout 2's turncoat actions during the battle, and likewise believed that Marquand, alongside Watts, had turned traitor, not realizing that he was unconscious the entire time and that Watts had been killed.<ref name=\"RS III\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''</ref>\n\nLater in the battle, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] donned Marquand's uniform and helmet in a guise to trick the [[Endor shield generator bunker]]'s commander, Major [[Hewex/Legends|Hewex]] into sending reinforcements into an ambush by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]].<ref name=\"ROJ\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMarquand was played by his namesake, [[Richard Marquand]], the director of [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. His CCG card, where he was first identified, cheekily hints at his namesake by saying he \"Directed a counterattack against the Ewoks on Endor.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Marquand}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'' {{Cutscene}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Power of the Force (1995 toy line)|text=''Star Wars: The Power of the Force''|pack=AT-ST Driver|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/POTF2atstdriver.asp|archivedate=20180729174514}}\n*{{CCG|set=Endor Limited|link=Endor-Dark/large/majormarquand.gif|cardname=Major Marquand}} {{1stID}}\n*{{CCG|set=Endor Limited|link=Endor-Dark/large/tempestscout2.gif|cardname=Tempest Scout 2}}\n*{{CCG|set=Endor Limited|link=Endor-Dark/large/lieutenantwatts.gif|cardname=Lieutenant Watts}}\n*{{FFCite|50|IMP10, ''Imperial Forces''}} {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Head-to-Head Tag Teams]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/04/photoreceptor20040409.html|text=Not The Face!}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Marquand\n|nl=Newland\n|pl=Marquand\n|ru=\u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0430\u043d\u0434\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army pilots]]\n[[Category:Kesselians]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
