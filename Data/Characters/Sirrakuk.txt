She shaved distinctive patches into her fur and loved to fly [[Starship/Legends|starships]].\n\nSirra completed her rite of passage (which she was hesitant to do because of the supposed [[Death/Legends|death]] of her friend [[Raabakyysh|Raaba]] while doing hers) during a fight with a [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] in the lower levels of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. Both Sirra and the Nightsister were swallowed by a [[Syren plant/Legends|syren plant]], but Sirra escaped and grabbed a handful of fibers on her way out.\n\nLater, after Raaba turned up alive, well, and promoting the [[Diversity Alliance]] on Kashyyyk, Sirra and Lowbacca accompanied her to [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]], where the pair were held against their will until they escaped. Sirra later accompanied a [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]] team sent to investigate claims about the Diversity Alliance, and in frustration, smashed open a crate marked \"medical supplies\", exposing the weapons inside. She was employed as an emergency pilot for the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSirrakuk was first mentioned in the [[1995]] novel ''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones]]'' by [[Kevin J.
