A [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], she was the daughter of Teeba [[Bohle]].\nAs she had an innate talent for [[Force healing/Legends|Force healing]], she helped [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] heal injured and sick villagers during the siege of [[Torbel]]. She asked if she could go to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] with him for [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]], but Kenobi, knowing she was too old, sadly refused. After the siege, she went with the rest of her village to live on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the war, Greti was an only child who lived with her mother [[Bohle]] and 300 residents in the village of [[Torbel]] on [[Lanteeb/Legends|Lanteeb]]. When the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] was occupied by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]], [[General/Legends|General]] [[Lok Durd/Legends|Lok Durd]] ordered the inhabitants to deliver everything in their mine to him. During that day, her mother and several miners caught a terrible illness which they contained from the [[Damotite]]. Greti was very worried when she came to visit them in the hospital camp. This was when she made her first encounter with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], who were disguised as villagers in order to put an end to the Separatist occupation. As Obi-Wan met her, he was amazed how Greti had a talent for [[Force healing/Legends|Force healing]], in which Greti developed a close friendship with him.\n\nThe next day, a [[theta storm]] moved over Torbel and damaged one of the shields, causing the village to fall into greater danger until Anakin powered the shield with his technical skills and saved the village. However, there were many casualties, including [[Arrad]], who were suffering a terrible illness. Since the Jedi's cover had been blown, Kenobi asked Greti and [[Sufi]] to help him treat the victims. Greti didn't know what to do, but Kenobi taught her how to control her emotions and managed to heal several villagers, including her mother, while the rest had already died from the illness. In the following days, Greti learned to meditate through the Force since she had trouble sleeping.\n\nWhen Lok Durd learned that the Jedi were hiding in the village, he sent his army to eliminate them. However, Anakin and Obi-Wan planned to deliver themselves to the Separatists in order to protect the villagers. As Greti learned of this, she convinced them to stay and provide refuge. During the siege, a Republic fleet managed to get through the planet and aid the villagers in fighting the Separatists. When [[Taria Damsin]] arrived to the village to warn Kenobi and Skywalker, she was severely injured after destroying Durd's laboratory at [[Lantibba City]]. Greti was able to heal the young [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] in time before the droid army approached the village. She was able to survive the attack, but Torbel was completely burnt down. On the same day, Greti and the surviving villagers were offered refuge by [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Jamillia/Legends|Jamillia]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. Before leaving, Greti asked if she could go to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to become a Jedi, but Kenobi, knowing she was too old, sadly refused. She understood what he meant and said her goodbye as she departs for Naboo.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege]]'' {{1st|[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Siege'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Siege'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Greti\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lanteebans]]"}}}]}}}}
