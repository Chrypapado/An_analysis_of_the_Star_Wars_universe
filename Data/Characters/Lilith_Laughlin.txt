After it was discovered that the criminal organization was based in Doaba Guerfel,<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|CorSec Case Files: The Unlucky Mayor|Corellia}}</ref> [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vitala Baize]] was designated to lead the investigation.<ref name=\"SWG:SwCB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Speak with Captain Baize|Corellia}}</ref> Captain Baize decided to use the help of Lilith Laughlin to discover putative Chirq Council members in Doaba Guerfel. However, Laughlin was not able to help the CorSec at that moment because some [[Ragtags|Ragtag]] cudgels led by [[Ventil Tamplin]] and [[Lilea Norith]] harassed her because they suspected her true allegiance. Captain Baize thus dispatched a spacer who previously worked for CorSec to deal definitively with the Ragtags.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCSC\" />\n\nLilith Laughlin immediately started to work for Captain Baize and she quickly found possible connections between the Red Circle Gang and a [[Drall/Legends|Drall]] terrorist organization known as the [[Drall Patriots]]. However, after a search in the [[Drall Patriot Warehouse]] in Doaba Guerfel, it appeared that there was no connection between the two groups. Laughlin later sent the spacer talk with [[Gwhirrye Baric]], a thug who ran a spice racket out of a small hospital in Doaba Guerfel. After the spacer helped him to deal with [[Xyrias Undea]] and the [[Rogue CorSec]] miscreants who harassed his business, Baric accepted to reveal a name: [[Trins Evnar]]. The man was a spice dealer with a red circle tattoo on his arm.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCSC\" /> Thanks to this information, Captain Baize discovered the identity of several Chirq Council members and managed to infiltrate an agent within the organization.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCAI\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: Assumed Identity|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nThe Chirq Council later discovered that an informant helped the CorSec in its investigation. The underboss [[Jzoro Quanera]] thus tasked Captain Baize's infiltrated agent to find and kill the informant. In order to protect Lilith Laughlin, the agent instead killed another woman, [[Ebela Puckett]], a [[Grey Shroud terrorists|Grey Shroud terrorist]] and Captain Baize created evidences that the terrorist was working for CorSec. Having earn the trust of Jzoro Quaner, the agent was allowed to have full access to Quanera's database and obtained the identity of the nine [[Elite Council|elite councilors]] who ruled the Chirq Council and the locations of their [[First Elite Council Bunker|secret]] [[Second Elite Council Bunker|headquarters]].<ref name=\"SWG:TCCMU\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: Moving Up|Corellia}}</ref> The CorSec operation eventually led to the destruction of the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCTEC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: The Elite Council|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLilith Laughlin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TCCSC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Threat_of_the_Conqueror#Card_gallery|cardname=Moving Up}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Chirq Council: Seek Council}}\n*{{SWGWiki|The Chirq Council: Moving Up - Part One}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laughlin, Lilith}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
