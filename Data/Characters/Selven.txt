Eventually, she abandoned her service to him to work as a freelance [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] for the highest bidder.\n\nSometime during or prior to [[3956 BBY]], possibly under the employ of [[House of Organa/Legends|House Organa]], Selven murdered six civilians\u2014an entire family of [[House Ulgo]]\u2014along with all their bodyguards. This massacre was only the first of a chain of killings that would lead to the extinction of the entire house on Taris. Day after day, more and more Ulgos fell at the hands of Selven, whether gunned down on the streets, [[Poison/Legends|poisoned]] in their own homes, or a variety of other methods. In spite of the level of security stacked against her, Selven was always able to elude the authorities, proving herself unstoppable to all the guards and [[droid]]s that the Ulgos could muster for their protection. By the end of her killing spree, no Ulgo remained alive on Taris, and she had earned a reputation as the best assassin on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIn the aftermath, House Organa fiercely pressured government authorities to place a contract on Selven's head, arguing that for this mass murderer to run loose threatened the lives of countless innocents. Despite this, the bitter rivalry that had existed between House Organa and House Ulgo was well-known, and there were many in the public that speculated that it was the Organas that had hired Selven to eliminate the Ulgos, and that they hoped her death would keep this secret from being exposed.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIn 3956 BBY, her bounty was posted by [[Zax]], the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] in charge of the [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] office at [[Javyar's Cantina]] in the [[Lower City]]. Numerous bounty hunters attempted to collect the bounty, but every last one of them were killed by Selven. When the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] occupied the planet during the [[Jedi Civil War]], the assassin was not intimidated by the [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith troopers]] that confronted her, slaying any that treated her as a hostile.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nThe amnesiac, former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Revan]], stranded on Taris for the time being due to the Sith quarantine, decided to undertake this bounty after meeting with Zax. With his companions, he managed to locate Selven hiding out at an [[Lower City Apartments|apartment]] in the Lower City, and at his hands the assassin finally met her demise.\n\nRevan would go on to claim the bounty on her before his [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|escape from Taris]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAs the exterminator of an entire house on Taris, Selven held the reputation of a ruthless killer bereft of a conscience and loyal only to money. She was infamous as the most dangerous assassin on Taris in her time, and she would proudly remind this to her enemies. When dealing with strangers, her demeanor was harsh and cold-hearted, confidently maintaining her control over the confrontation through intimidation. As a fugitive, she regarded all with suspicion, taking virtually no chances with any strangers, and asserting authority through gunpoint by establishing only she was allowed to pose questions. With her heavy experience in the art of bloodshed, she did not fear death and was swift to mete it out to those hostile to her.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIn spite of her mercilessness, she was willing to allow trepassers a second chance to rethink their course if they claimed they were merely lost. Even so, this would be accompanied by an express warning that another misstep would be greeted with immediate retaliation without chance for negotiation: a warning that she made with relentless sincerity.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nSelven by 3956 BBY had earned the reputation as the most dangerous assassin on Taris, a title that was justified by her ability to slaughter every member of the Ulgo family day-after-day in spite of all the efforts of local enforcement and the Ulgos' guards to stop her. Her methods of assassination went beyond mere conventional combat as she was cited by Zax to have been capable of poisoning people in their own homes. Even in spite of her notoriety, she managed to continuously evade the government authorities and all other bounty hunters. Only Revan and his friends possessed the skills necessary to find and defeat her.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIn battle, she commonly relied on rapidly firing volleys of blaster bolts but was entirely capable of precision shooting. More than that, she was highly trained in swordsmanship, turning to it if the gap between her and her enemies closed.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nIn battle, Selven donned the conventional [[battle armor]] of the [[Jedi Civil War]] era which provided her ample protection against enemy weapons. She primarily utilized a single [[Heavy blaster pistol/Legends|heavy blaster pistol]] but kept a vibrosword at the ready if the situation demanded close-quarters combat.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nAt the time of her death, she additionally had in her possession a pair of [[neural band]]s, an [[adrenaline amplifier]], and a [[Sniper rifle/Legends|sniper rifle]] [[Scope/Legends|scope]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSelven is a non-player character in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', serving as one of several bounties that the player, Revan, can collect on Taris.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nOut of a total of five, she is the only bounty target other than [[Matrik]] that the player can kill without receiving [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points, given her status as a mass murderer.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nUpon finding her at her Lower City apartment, Selven will immediately interrogate the player as to his/her intentions. The player can outright declare that he/she means to kill her to collect the bounty or otherwise proclaim that he/she intends to rob her. Both options lead to an immediate fight. Alternatively, the player can claim he/she innocently stumbled into her apartment while exploring the area, to which Selven will respond by allowing the player to withdraw, but only after warning that stepping into her apartment again will result in instant retaliation. Sure enough, if the player speaks with her again, she will attack. The player can also ask Selven to identify herself, but doing so will only cycle back to all the aforementioned options since Selven refuses to answer, asserting that she is the only one who is in the position to ask questions.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nThe bounty on Selven, like all the other bounties posted by Zax, is worth 300 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] or 400 if the player successfully bargains for more. If the player fails to convince Zax to raise the reward but insists on pressuring him, he/she will be dismissed without any reward entirely.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nStrangely, it appears that killing her prematurely sometimes results in a black game screen. In this event, the game continues to work other than the screen becoming black, with all other processes such as sounds, the cursor, even menus, working exactly as they should. Saving and reloading rectifies this glitch.{{Fact}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Selven\n|pl=Selven\n|fi=Selven\n|ru=\u0421\u0435\u043b\u0432\u0435\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
