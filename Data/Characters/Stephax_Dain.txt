Following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he was a lieutenant of the [[Meatlumps|Meatlump gang]], a Corellian technology-hating [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorist]] organization.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP7\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Stephax Dain launched an ambitious attack on a [[Weapons Research Facility (Rori)|Weapons Research Facility]] located on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Rori/Legends|Rori]]. However, a rival Meatlump lieutenant by the name of [[Kaiya Merel]] was not keen on letting Dain take all the credit of this action. She tasked a new Meatlump recruit to search Stephax Dain's camp near [[Kor Vella/Legends|Kor Vella]]. The [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] found a well-worn notebook that contained detailed information about Stephax's plans. Kaiya Merel therefore ordered her recruit to disrupt the facility operations before her rival but Stephax and his Meatlump pronks had already taken over the facility when the spacer arrived on Rori. The adventurer attacked the Meatlumps to take control of the research facility, killing Stephax Dain and a number of pronks.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP7\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:DephaxStain.png|thumb|left|150px|Dephax Stain.]]\nStephax Dain appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP7\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Stephax Dain was added to the game with the update dubbed \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 10|Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King]]\", released on [[June 19]], [[2008]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67812&month=062008|text=Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King|archivedate=20110924005831}}</ref>\n\nThis non-player character (NPC) was known in the game as '''Stephax Dain''' or '''Dephax Stain''', depending of the Combat Level (CL) of the player.
