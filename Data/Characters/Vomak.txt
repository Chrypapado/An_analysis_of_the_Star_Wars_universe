By [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], he worked at the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena/Legends|Grand Arena]] of [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]]. That year, Vomak met the [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]] [[Junk dealer/Legends|junk dealer]] [[Watto/Legends|Watto]], who had just lost his slave [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] in a bet with the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]]. Watto enlisted the services of Vomak and tasked him to corner Master Jinn in the streets of Mos Espa before he could leave the planet with the young Skywalker. To do so, Vomak brought several henchmen with him, but his attempt at stopping the Jedi was unsuccessful.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVomak and the group of hired thugs appear in ''[[Episode I: Qui-Gon Jinn]]'', a one-shot [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] story written by [[Ryder Windham]] that ties into the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]. According to [[Star Wars Galaxy Collector 6|''Star Wars Galaxy Collector'' 6]], the comic's script names the character \"Vomac,\" but the proper spelling appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide]]'' CD-ROM reference guide. None of the thugs are named in the comic book story, but Vomak can be indentified since he is the lead thug, and is hired personally by Watto. The ''Insider's Guide'' refers to him as an [[Abyssin/Legends|Abyssin]], but the comic shows him to be of an unidentified reptilian species.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Episode I: Qui-Gon Jinn]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CollectorCite|6|Around the Galaxy|Around the Galaxy: Dark Horse Unmasks The Phantom Menace}} {{C|as \"Vomac\"}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vomak#legends\n}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
