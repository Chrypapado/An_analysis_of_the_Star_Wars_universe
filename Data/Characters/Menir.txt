He married [[Elise]], a woman from Skirl. Though initially happy, their relationship soured after Menir, who had become intensely dedicated to protecting his way of life, attacked a [[Iren|traveler]] that Elise had invited into their home. The traveler's sole possession&mdash;a bag containing three seeds&mdash;was left behind in the struggle and Menir, after mocking what little the traveler had, tossed the seeds outside.<ref name=\"ABH\" />\n\nThe seeds eventually grew into monstrous creatures known as [[Drengir]], which destroyed both Skirl and Menir's home, [[Death|killing]] Elise. The farmer realized what he had done after discovering what had happened, and he was confronted by the traveler outside the ruins of his house.<ref name=\"ABH\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=A Bitter Harvest|book=Dark Legends}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
