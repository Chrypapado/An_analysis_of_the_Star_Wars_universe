Call it ''madness''. Call it ''art''&mdash;it's all the ''same'' to me: I must know ''more''.|Cornelius Evazan|Doctor Aphra (2016) 25}}\n[[Doctor]] '''Cornelius Evazan''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] from the [[planet]] [[Alsakan]] who was a promising cosmetic surgeon until he became gripped by madness and began practicing \"creative surgery\" on his patients, leaving his victims horrifically disfigured. During an encounter with a [[bounty hunter]], which left his face hideously scarred, the [[Aqualish]] thug [[Ponda Baba]] rescued Evazan, following which the two formed an uneasy partnership. While working as the personal doctor of [[Dryden Vos]], Evazan created an order of servants known as the [[Decraniated]]. Wanted men, he assumed the alias of \"'''Roofoo''',\" while Baba became known as \"Sawkee,\" and after committing a rash of crimes on [[Milvayne]], Evazan was nicknamed the '''Mutilator of Milvayne'''.\n\nIn the [[Jedha City|Holy City]] on [[Jedha]], the fugitive [[Cyberneticist|cyborgist]] used his ghastly medical techniques to produce more of the Decraniated from insurgent victims. Shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Evazan and Baba were patrons in the [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina|Mos Eisley Cantina]] on [[Tatooine]]. When a drunk Baba decided to pick a fight with a local [[farm]]boy named [[Luke Skywalker]], Evazan quickly escalated the conflict, causing Skywalker's guardian, a hermit named [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]&mdash;in secret one of the few remaining [[Jedi Master]]s&mdash;to slash Evazan across the chest and [[Dismemberment|sever]] Baba's right [[Limb|arm]] with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's third lightsaber|his lightsaber]]. Evazan tried to use his medical training to reattach Baba's arm but failed, nearly [[Death|killing]] the Aqualish in the process.\n\nHiding from the death sentences he had received, Evazan infiltrated a [[biofarm]] on [[Thannt]] and stole a [[pluripleq]], a [[Changeling|shape-shifting]] creature, and used it to disguise his face, taking the name \"'''Lopset Yas'''.\" \"Yas\" was soon [[Prison|imprisoned]] by the [[Galactic Empire]] in [[Accresker Jail]], becoming a member of their [[Accresker Penal Legion|expendable fighting force]] in [[Chelli Lona Aphra's squad|a]] [[squad]] with [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Chelli Aphra]], who nicknamed him \"'''Flopso'''.\"\n\nAfter Accresker Jail was [[Skirmish aboard Accresker Jail|decommissioned]] and fired on a collision course with [[Tiferep Major]], Evazan followed Aphra, still in disguise. \"Lopset\" pretended to shape-shift into Evazan to trick the vigilante [[Tam Posla]], whom sought his arrest, into agreeing to rescue them. Aphra and Posla agreed to trade Evazan, both of them unaware of his true identity. Thinking he had been tricked, Posla returned to the prison with \"Yas\" to arrest Aphra. While there, Evazan managed to incapacitate both Aphra and the [[assassin droid]] [[0-0-0]], taking them aboard [[Posla's ship]]. Revealing who he truly was, Evazan removed his [[proximity bomb]] and placed it in Triple-Zero, leaving the two stranded together for his own entertainment.\n\nEvazan and Baba watched from afar as Aphra and Triple-Zero [[Chase on Milvayne|traveled]] to Milvayne to have their proximity bombs removed. Evazan decided to hire the monster [[hunter]]s [[Winloss]] and [[Nokk]] to hunt the pair, as well as broadcasting the live feed from Triple-Zero's eyes to the citizens of Milvayne, prompting any money craving individuals to help the [[Milvayne Authority]] capture them. Eventually, though, Winloss and Nokk let their targets live and instead captured Evazan and deactivated the proximity bombs.\n\n==Biography==\n===Fugitive surgeon===\n{{Quote|I met him once, at a banquet.

The [[Besalisk]] [[Dexter Jettster]] heard rumors of these illegal cyborg modifications and bodies grown to fit buyer specifications and traveled to Athus Klee to investigate. He found the ore hub and sneaked around the processing plant, taking a scans of the workers with his [[macrobinoculars]]. After rescuing a [[Rodian]] [[Unidentified Rodian cyborg|worker]] from the ore hub, Jettster returned to the [[spaceport]] where he arrived and contacted a [[Unidentified politician (Dexter Jettster)|politician]] to inform them of the place.

During the battle, [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Chelli Aphra]], a member of the squad, sabotaged their [[hubdroid]] by feeding it false information. \"Yas\" asked what was wrong with the droid, but Aphra just greeted him, calling him by his pet name, Flopso. As Evazan corrected her on his fake name, the hubdroid exploded, killing all the other members of the squad. \"Yas\" began to panic as their [[proximity bomb]]s started beeping, about to detonate. However, another hubdroid, [[Dek-Nil]], arrived, and \"Yas\" begged him to let him and Aphra into his [[Squad Dek-Nil|squad]], which had been lost in a series of improbable accidents.

Witnessing this, Yas asked Aphra what she thought was happening, but she was distracted by the spirit, who disassembled Dek-Nil with [[the Force]]. Aphra shot the spirit, and it disappeared, revealing an infestation of [[gundravian hookspore]]s, which Evazan recognized as the most infectious saprophyte in existence. They rapidly fired at the hookspores, which retreated into the ship, revealing the corpse of [[Unidentified Jedi (Accresker Jail)|a long-dead Jedi]].

Evazan changed back into his disguised appearance as Starros and Tolvan discovered that the staff off Accresker were abandoning the [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] that pulled the prison. \"Yas\" asked if they should run, which Aphra agreed with.<ref name=\"Aphra 22\" />\n\n[[File:Force_spirit_kills_several.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lopset watches the Force spirit kill several prisoners]]\nAs the [[cruiser]] crashed into the body of the wreckage-prison, Evazan watched as the convicts began to riot and fight each other. The convicts recognized Aphra as the one that had been interrogated, and she and \"Yas\" once again agreed to run. They turned around to see a prisoner aiming a large gun at them, but the prisoner was killed by the Force spirit, who then killed several others. Evazan noticed that the spirit disappeared if it strayed too far from its ship, and Aphra connected it to the dead Jedi they had discovered earlier. Tolvan suggested breaking into the ''Arquitens''-class cruiser, but \"Yas\" asked whether they should wait for Posla to rescue them. Aphra disregarded the possibility of Posla coming to Accresker, so Starros decided to use the large weapon they had been threatened with earlier to break through the wall of the cruiser. Evazan helped hold the gun, and then entered the cruiser behind Starros, Tolvan and Aphra.<ref name=\"Aphra 23\" />\n\nInside the cruiser, Evazan discovered [[Bor Ifriem|the]] interrogation [[Mairan|Bor]], which had not been properly refrozen. Aphra discovered that an escape pod still remained in the cruiser, but they had no way of getting to it. Yas suggested the large gun, but the weapon was too heavy to move. Aphra took Dek-Nil's head from Yas so that she could slice into the generator that controlled the prison's gravity. Aphra did so, setting the gravity to half of what it had been while also bringing the wreckage of the hookspore-infected ship towards them. Yas took the piece of Dek-Nil back as they made their way through the prison, arriving at the Penumbra-1. The hookspores briefly possessed all four of them, but was unable to sense anything from Yas, rejecting him as a potential host. Starros realized that Aphra had purposely brought the Jedi's ship towards them so she could retrieve the lightsaber, telling her that the hookspores would not move until they had a heroic host to possess.<ref name=\"Aphra 23\" />\n\n===Revealing the truth===\n{{Quote|Irony is, if Posla didn't get so angry at being lied to, he might've realized! He had his man after all.|Cornelius Evazan, revealing his identity|Doctor Aphra (2016) 25}}\nAphra led Starros, Tolvan, and \"Yas\" to the single remaining escape pod in the wreckage of the cruiser. While Starros and Tolvan climbed into the escape pod, Evazan remained outside with Aphra, who launched the escape pod. Tolvan, who had not realized that Aphra was intending to stay behind, leapt out of the pod at the last second, leaving Starros alone in the launched pod. Aphra was irritated with Tolvan, telling her that she had only planned to escape alone. \"Yas\" questioned this, and Aphra quickly corrected herself, ensuring him that her plan would still work with the three of them.<ref name=\"Aphra 24\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 24|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 24]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lopset_Yas_frozen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tam Posla inspects the frozen Evazan]]\nEvazan followed Aphra and Tolvan to the main launch [[hangar]], and Aphra told him to remain standing on a grille in the floor. Before \"Lopset\" could ask Aphra why he needed to stand there, Tam Posla arrived in his ship. Aphra began speaking to Evazan, who realized she wanted him to \"shape-shift\" back into his true form. Pretending to be distressed by Aphra's attempt to exploit him, he recalled the quote Aphra told him when he first revealed his ability. Evazan shape-shifted out of his disguise, acting as if he was worried that he would give himself away. Reminding \"Yas\" of the frozen interrogation Bor they had seen previously, she revealed that he was standing on top of a [[coolant grille]], which she activated, freezing Evazan. Tam Posla exited his ship to confirm that Aphra had Evazan, and fell for the \"trick.\" Posla took the chunk of ice containing Evazan aboard his ship, and left Accresker Jail.<ref name=\"Aphra 24\" />\n\nAs he flew away, Posla looked behind him at his frozen prisoner, having doubts about whether it was truly who he thought it was. In order to find out, he ordered his ship to divert its power to the [[heating array]], so that the ice containing \"Yas\" would melt.<ref name=\"Aphra 24\" /> After it did so, Evazan pretended that he was Yas, and Posla returned to Accresker Jail so he could confront Aphra. Evazan followed him, and found Aphra watching a transmission of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] interrogating Tolvan. Posla stepped out to arrest Aphra, but was attacked from behind by [[0-0-0]] and killed. Evazan escaped, meeting up with Aphra as Triple-Zero was dragging her to [[Touring ship|his ship]]. He shot the [[assassin droid]], pretending to save Aphra, who began to thank him. Evazan then [[stun]]ned Aphra and took both her and the droid aboard Tam Posla's ship.<ref name=\"Aphra 25\" />\n\n[[File:Evazan_unmasked.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Evazan reveals his true identity]]\nBy the time that Aphra woke up and questioned what he had done, Evazan had begun to work on the incapacitated Triple-Zero, implanting his proximity bomb in the droid. Evazan turned to Aphra, removing the pluripleq from his face and revealing who he truly was. He finished his work, telling a shocked Aphra that her own proximity bomb was now linked to the one placed in 0-0-0. As he did so, Ponda Baba docked with the ship, and Evazan began to leave, taking the Aqualish's severed arm with him. He repeated the quote that Aphra had said to him, wishing to test her mother's theory. As he left, boarding the ship that his friend had brought, he told Aphra that she and Triple-Zero deserved to be together.<ref name=\"Aphra 25\" />\n\n===Live entertainment===\n{{Quote|Old friend, the galaxy trembles at the infamy of Doctor Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba. We must lie low.

Evazan began working on a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] arm to replace the one Baba lost, watching as Aphra and the droid [[Chase on Milvayne|made their way]] to Milvayne to find [[Rajam Nuss]], the personal [[cyberneticist]] of Tam Posla. However, Triple-Zero had worked out that Evazan was watching their actions, requesting a [[mirror]] so he could look the doctor in the eye. The threat unnerved Evazan, as did the pair's success as locating Doctor Nuss, but he shrugged it off, doubting the cyberneticist's abilities.<ref name=\"Aphra 26\" />\n\n[[File:Evazan_Aphra26.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Evazan and Baba watch the viewscreen]]\nNuss began to work on extracting the proximity bombs, waking up Aphra and the droid and claiming that he had succeeded. As Aphra went to leave, Triple-Zero demanded that Nuss trace the broadcast signal from his eyes. Evazan and Baba were worried by this, until Aphra realized that Nuss had failed to remove the bombs, instead triggering a countdown. Cheering, Evazan watched as Triple-Zero murdered Nuss, believing that the cyberneticist was no longer useful.<ref name=\"Aphra 26\" />\n\nWith only ten [[Standard hour|hours]] until the bombs went off, Aphra and Triple-Zero sought out [[Professor]] [[Prexo]], Nuss' mentor. At the same time, Evazan contacted the [[Hunting|hunters]] [[Nokk]] and [[Winloss]], posing as [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of the Rebel Alliance. As Organa, Evazan tasked the hunters with the destruction of Triple-Zero. They immediately refused and went to leave, but stopped upon noticing Aphra on the viewscreen.<ref name=\"Aphra 27\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 27|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 27]]</ref> As the hunters had been tricked and left for dead by Aphra before,<ref name=\"Aphra Annual 2\">[[Doctor Aphra Annual 2|''Doctor Aphra Annual'' 2]]</ref> Evazan changed the offer, requesting the death of Aphra instead.

He expressed his doubt in Winloss and Nokk's success, but thought either outcome would be interesting to watch, turning nervously to look at the viewscreen, where Triple-Zero was threatening him through a mirror. Aphra and the assassin droid continued to make their way across [[Milvayne City]], but they were intercepted by Tam Posla, who had been resurrected by the Force-imbued gundravian hookspores.<ref name=\"Aphra 27\" />\n\n===Broadcasting worldwide===\n{{Quote|So stay tuned, folks!

However, the hunters were distracted by BT-1, who attacked them, letting the latter pair escape. With the commotion temporarily over, Evazan installed Baba's new cybernetic arm, equipped with its own mini-flamer. Fearing Triple-Zero may survive to hunt him down, he then strengthened the broadcast signal from the droid's eyes to present his entertainment back to the residents of Milvayne. With the populous now watching the live feed, Evazan announced Aphra and Triple-Zero as fugitive on the run, prompting any willing individuals to help the Milvayne Authority catch them. As money-craving callers made false claims about the pair in the hopes of winning the prize, Posla, revived again by the hookspores from his impalement, re-affiliated himself with the Milvayne Authority and led them to the fugitives as they traveled on a [[bloatbarge]].<ref name=\"Aphra 28\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 28|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 28]]</ref>\n\nDespite being captured, Aphra and Triple-Zero were able to escape after Aphra tricked the Milvayne Authority officers into turning on Posla.

With Triple-Zero having fully studied his memories, he realized that his [[0-0-0's creator|creator]] had rejected him, and decided to walk away. Aphra convinced him to return by reactivating BT-1. When Triple-Zero remarked the importance of a comrade, Evazan admitted that he made a point. The pair continued traveling to the residence of Professor Prexo, with Vulaada Klam returning to help them. However, Winloss and Nokk had found the professor first and used him to track down Evazan and Baba. The couple broke into Evazan's ship and captured the pair, deactivating Aphra and Triple-Zero's proximity bombs and turning off the live feed.<ref name=\"Aphra 31\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Dialogue|Cornelius Evazan|You just watch yourself.
