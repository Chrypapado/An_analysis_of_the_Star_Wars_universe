She used her network of contacts within the Core Worlds to establish Dune Sea Outfitters in order to ensure she always met her customers' expectations and needs. Her desire to keep the contents of her warehouse a closely-guarded secret - [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[guard]]s patrolled at all hours, and no one was allowed into the warehouse - meant that Rayne was the subject of many rumors, despite the outward legitimacy of her business. Much of the merchandise hidden within the warehouse was acquired for shipment by Brentaal's Wayward Children.\n\nShe employed a [[Rayne's load lifter|binary load lifter]] in her shop, and she was sometimes visited by a [[Unidentified furtive Jawa|furtive Jawa]] who also met with [[Arden Telowe]]. Her wardrobe consists of a form-fitting jumpsuit, boots, and a visored hat.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRayne appears in the article ''[[Secrets of Mos Eisley]]'' in [[2001]]'s [[Star Wars Gamer 7]]''.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|7|Secrets of Mos Eisley}} {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Brentaalans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]"}}}]}}}}
