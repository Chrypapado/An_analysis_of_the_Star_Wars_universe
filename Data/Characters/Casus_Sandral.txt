He was working on archeological ''[sic]'' digs here on Dantooine when he disappeared.|Rahasia Sandral|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Casus Sandral''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] living on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He was a member of the [[Sandral family]], being the son of [[Nurik Sandral|Nurik]] and the brother of [[Rahasia Sandral|Rahasia]]. He befriended [[Shen Matale]] after his sister fell in love with the [[Matale family|Matale]] despite paternal friction between the two families. Casus was an [[Archaeologist/Legends|archaeologist]] interested in the ancient ruins of Dantooine, but he was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] while on an expedition to [[Rakatan ruins (Dantooine)|one site]]. His father believed that his nemesis, [[Ahlan Matale]], was responsible for Casus's death until [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], was able to settle the dispute between the families peacefully.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Casus... is dead? I was afraid of this, yet in my heart I knew it must be true.|Nurik Sandral, to Revan, upon learning of Casus' death|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], Casus Sandral was the son of [[Nurik Sandral]] and brother to [[Rahasia Sandral]]. At some point the children's mother [[Death/Legends|died]], leaving Nurik to raise his children by himself. Nurik moved [[Sandral family|his family]] to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] in search of peace and safety, arriving shortly after [[Ahlan Matale]] had done the same with [[Matale family|his family]]. The two men fell into a series of disputes with each other and developed a hostile relationship which they attempted to enforce on their children. However, their efforts were not entirely successful as Casus' sister Rahasia met with Ahlan's son [[Shen Matale|Shen]] when they were alone and fell in love. Casus later met with Shen and the two began to form a friendship.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nCasus was an amateur [[Archaeologist/Legends|archaeologist]] and worked on digs while on Dantooine around the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He was investigating strange ruins across the planet<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> and, in [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"3956bby\" /> he made an expedition to [[Rakatan ruins (Dantooine)|ruins]]<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|126|Sandral, Nurik}}</ref> of an origin he noted in his personal [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] as \"The [[Rakata/Legends|Rak]]\". Before Casus reached the ruins, however, he was attacked by a pack of [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]]&mdash;vicious predatory animals&mdash;and mauled to death. Unaware of Casus' fate, his father believed that his disappearance was the fault of the Matale family, and kidnapped Shen Matale in retaliation.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nThe [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] soon came across the archaeologist's body while investigating the disappearance of Shen Matale. Revan collected Casus' diary from his remains and returned it to his grieving father, declining Nurik's [[Currency/Legends|financial]] reward. The Padawan then peacefully resolved the dispute between the two families, allowing Casus' sister and her lover to live their lives together with their fathers' blessings.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nCasus had a loving relationship with his father but did not share the elder's hostility towards the Matale family, even becoming friends with Shen Matale shortly before his death. He also kept a diary in which he logged his private thoughts. His [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] were [[Color/Legends|grey]] in color, and his skin fair.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nCasus used a datapad for keeping his diary. When he set out on his fateful expedition, he carried an [[Echani shield|energy shield]] and [[Echani light armor|light armor]] of [[Echani/Legends|Echani]] make as well as a [[Verpine headband]] and a [[cardio package]] [[Cybernetics/Legends|implant]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|You know, Nurik, Ahlan actually did kill Casus.''\"<br />\"''He... WHAT??|Revan, to Nurik Sandral, in a non-canon version of events|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nCasus was a background character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. In his dead appearance Casus's skin color was light instead of dark like his family, as the graphical model used for his corpse was a generic one used throughout the game.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nIn ''Knights of the Old Republic'', it is possible for the player to miss or otherwise ignore Casus's corpse and thus the diary is not returned. The Sandral-Matale feud quest can still progress to completion, and the player can take a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] path at the conclusion by lying to Nurik and blaming Ahlan Matale for Casus's death, resulting in both families killing each other.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nA reference to Casus can be found in the \"Secrets of the Enclave\" Flashpoint during the Dark Descent expansion of ''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' in the form of his Obituary.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}} {{Corpse}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CSWECite|III||Sandral, Nurik}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Casus Sandral\n|pl=Casus Sandral\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u0441\u0443\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sandral, Casus}}\n[[Category:Archaeologists]]\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
