The clan was stationed at the [[Bogden Jedi chapter house|Jedi chapter house]] on [[Bogden 3]]. They were awaiting transport back to the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]], which had been delayed due to the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|battle]] there. When Masters K'Kruhk and [[Sian Jeisel]] arrived with their clone troopers, [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] was issued. Several of the younglings were [[Massacre on Bogden 3|killed]] as [[Du Mahn]] defended them. K'Kruhk and Piru ultimately escaped with nine younglings to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, the young boy was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk.\n\n===Great Jedi Purge===\nThe boy was present when [[Lumbra]] and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that the broken ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, fellow youngling, [[Seddwia]], jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi younglings, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\nThe younglings were freed by [[K'Kruhk]] who gave in to un-jedi like behavior briefly. With the help of Chase Piru, he shot down Lumbra's men with arrows. Lumbra and his shipmate, Callow, died at the hands of K'Kruhk's lightsaber.\n\n===Arkinnea===\nThis youngling and the rest of the Jedi crash-landed on the [[planet]] [[Arkinnea]] and were taken into custody by the [[Arkinnea Militia]]. He were placed into a refugee camp with the rest of their group. The youngling was present when Master [[Zao]] found them in the refugee camp. After dinner, he sat down with the rest of the younglings as Zao taught them their daily lesson.<ref name=\"FC1\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 1]]''</ref>\n\nThe boy, along with the rest of the younglings and Jedi, escaped the refugee camp under the cover of darkness and made their way out into the Arkinnean countryside. The younglings scavenged fields, picking [[Beelpop melon]]s and other [[vegetable/Legends|vegetables]]. He greeted K'Kruhk as the Jedi master joined them with a [[Wooly|pack animal]]. They continued their trip, and the youngling took a nap in the back of the [[Repulsorcart/Legends|repulsorcart]] with the rest of the clan. They reached a hill, and the boy joined in with the rest of the younglings as they raced Piru to the top. When they reached the top, they discovered an open mass grave where the Arkinnea Militia had been dropping refugees to their deaths.<ref name=\"FC2\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 2]]''</ref>  They then watched in horror as an ore carrier flew over the valley and dropped another load of refugees to their deaths. When K'Kruhk realized the group had been spotted, he used the Force to move the others into the back of the cart. The vehicle reached the bottom of the hill and hit a [[tree/Legends|tree]], throwing everyone out of it.<ref name=\"DTFC3\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 3]]''</ref>\n\nAfter recovering from the crash, the boy and the rest of the younglings followed Zao deeper into the forest. The youngling hid with the group when they heard blaster fire and was present when the [[Yunu]] found the group of Jedi. The Arkinnea Militia caught up with the two groups and held them at gunpoint.<ref name=\"DTFC4\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 4]]''</ref> As the militia opened fire, Zao used to force to raise a boulder out of the ground to give them cover. The boy fled with Piru and the other younglings but returned to help defend Zao. After the battle, the youngling and the rest of the clan followed the Yunu deeper into the forest. The youngling greeted K'Kruhk when he caught up with the rest of the group. The youngling settled into his [[Hidden Temple (Arkinnea)|new home]] and continued his training as a Jedi.<ref name=\"FC5\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Times: Parallels]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 1]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 2]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 3]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 4]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bogden residents]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Soaring Hawkbat Clan]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Jedi of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
