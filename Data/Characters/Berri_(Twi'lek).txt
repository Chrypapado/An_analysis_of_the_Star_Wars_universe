They helped [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] to provoke Krayn's slaves into revolting, resulting in their freedom.\n\nBerri herself, in her kitchen role, was able to retrieve [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]] and Anakin Skywalker's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] from Tachi's quarters (where the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] had hidden them beneath her [[Sleeper (furniture)|sleep-couch]]), slipping the weapons through a food-delivery panel in the door of the high-security cell in which Berri's master had incarcerated the Jedi. Her courageous action allowed Tachi and Skywalker to escape their imprisonment by Krayn, but also to then initiate the slave revolt, which ultimately secured freedom for the slaves of Nar Shaddaa and ended with Skywalker's killing of the infamous [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] and crime-lord.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Jedi Quest 3|''Jedi Quest'' 3]]\n*[[Jedi Quest 4|''Jedi Quest'' 4]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Berri (Person)\n|nl=Berri\n|pl=Berri\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
