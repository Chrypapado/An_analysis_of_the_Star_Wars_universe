It was at those three locations that [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] attempted to honor him by giving him love cards or [[Chak heart]]s.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKyoopid was just like any other Ewok, except that he dyed his fur and wore wings with [[magic]]al properties. These wings kept him afloat, in a similar fashion to that of [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarians]]. He marked his chest and back leg with painted hearts -- a universal symbol of love throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKyoopid is a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) that makes appearance during the Ewok Festival of Love Celebrations in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. He was introduced during the Festival of Love of [[2009]], and has since made appearances during each subsequent, yearly event. Players attempt to locate him and give him a bundled pack of love cards or Chak Hearts. In exchange, Kyoopid gives the player a badge.\n\nThe name Kyoopid appeared to be a reference to [[Wikipedia:Cupid|Cupid]] of [[Wikipedia:Valentine's Day|Valentine's Day]]. This was further reinforced by the fact that one of the Festival of Love quests was titled, ''Playing Cupid''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{C|Festival of Love 2009-2011}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kyoopid}}\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Ewoks]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
