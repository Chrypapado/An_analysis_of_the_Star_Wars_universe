He was unwilling to live on another [[Planet/Legends|planet]] that had trees because they reminded him of the home he could not live on, so he spent nearly ten [[Standard year/Legends|years]] as a pilot on a [[Spice/Legends|spice]] [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]].\n\nUpon visiting [[Genarius]], he fell in love with the freedom of the open skies, and with a beauty of a different kind from Ithor. He loved the air and flying, was enraptured by the shapes that clouds made, and felt that piloting a bubbleship looked like he was towing a cloud of his own.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Erd Lumas#legends\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lumas, Erd}}\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Ithorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Miners]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
