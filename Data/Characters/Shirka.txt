However, a week after that, the [[Ralltiiri Secretariat]] vetoed that decision because of certain influential off-world investors who did not like the idea. The [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] had approved the allocation of funds for Ralltiir but many on Ralltiir, including Shirka, believed that these funds would never arrive.\n\n[[Leia Organa Solo]] went to Ralltiir with six thousand exilees from [[Gyndine/Legends|Gyndine]]. Shirka explained her the situation, trying to convince her of the logical of his economic perspective. As Shirka was rude, Organa Solo tried her best to convince him, but it was useless. When she finally accused him of pandering to the privileged citizens of Ralltiir, Shirka closed the communication channel.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Shirka\n|es=Shirka\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Ralltiiri]]"}}}]}}}}
