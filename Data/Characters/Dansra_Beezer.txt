She was a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]], [[Technician/Legends|technician]], and communications specialist who trained under [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Brooks Carlson]] to serve as a [[Scout/Legends|scout]] for the [[Alliance Special Forces/Legends|Alliance commandos]]. In 4 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY]], Beezer was part of a [[Endor strike team/Legends|strike team]] sent to the [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon of Endor]] to deactivate the [[Endor shield generator bunker|planetary shield generator]] protecting the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Death Star II/Legends|second Death Star]] [[battlestation]] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] around the [[Moon/Legends|moon]]. Part of the strike team's [[Renegade Squadron/Legends|Renegade Squadron]] detachment, Beezer was responsible for communications. After arriving on Endor, Beezer and the strike team were separated from the command crew following encounters with Imperial [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout trooper]] patrols. Eventually, they encountered an [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|All Terrain Scout Transport]] while making camp for the [[Standard day/Legends|night]]. Beezer, whose role included [[Jammer|jamming]] Imperial transmissions in case of emergencies, did so with the [[Walker/Legends|walker's]] transmissions. She later fought in the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], which ended with the destruction of the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator/Legends|shield generator]], allowing Alliance [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] to destroy the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]].\n\nAt some point by [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], Beezer served as a [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]] in the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] [[New Republic Intelligence Service|Intelligence Service]].

Beezer worked as a slicer to protect Aybock from a hostile rival employed by [[Reussi]] [[Torel Vorne]] of the Reuss Corporation, whose intent was to ensure Aybock's [[Death/Legends|death]]. Ultimately, the New Republic succeeded in the mission, Aybock won his match, and the Reuss Corporation lost control of Reuss VIII, with the New Republic taking over the planet's government.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Dansra Beezer [[Alderaanian/Legends|hailed]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]].

To actually destroy the [[Space station/Legends|station]], however, the Alliance first had to deactivate the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator/Legends|SLD-26 planetary shield generator]] on Endor's surface, which was protecting the superweapon. Alliance [[General/Legends|General]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] assembled a [[Endor strike team/Legends|strike team]] for the mission to Endor,<ref name=\"RotJ\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> of which Beezer was a member.<ref name=\"CCG\" /> She was a part of the strike team's [[Renegade Squadron/Legends|Renegade Squadron]] component,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> responsible for communications and ordered to disrupt all Imperial transmissions in case of emergency.<ref name=\"FF\">{{FFCite|44|END12, ''The Battle of Endor''}}</ref>\n\nBeezer and the rest of the strike team traveled to the [[Endor system/Legends|Endor system]] aboard the stolen Imperial [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class T4a shuttle]] [[Tydirium/Legends|''Tydirium'']], [[Pilot/Legends|piloted]] by Solo. Once it reached the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] construction site, the [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] was queried by the Imperial [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']], which was in defensive orbit over Endor. However, Solo bypassed the ''Executor'' with the use of a stolen Imperial code, and the ''Tydirium'' was given clearance to land on the [[Forest/Legends|Forest]] [[Moon/Legends|Moon]]. After disembarking, Beezer and the strike team began scouting the area, but Solo and fellow command crew members [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], along with the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], eventually became separated from the main group after encounters with Imperial [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout trooper]] patrols. Nevertheless, Solo ordered the [[Squad/Legends|squad]] to continue on.<ref name=\"CCG\" /><ref name=\"RotJ\" /> The squad made its way toward the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield generator]] under the lead of [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Bren Derlin/Legends|Bren Derlin]].<ref name=\"Night Attack\">{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|text=''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi,'' Second Edition|story=Night Attack}}</ref>\n\nUpon [[Standard day/Legends|nightfall]], the squad made camp in a camouflaged shallow ravine, posting two sentries and setting up a [[blanket grid]] with its [[Scanner|scanning equipment]]. Shortly after the squad's first [[Sleep/Legends|sleeping]] shift, the scanners detected an [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|All Terrain Scout Transport]] [[Walker/Legends|walker]] moving toward the Rebels' location. Beezer [[Jammer|jammed]] the walker's transmissions, and another member, [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Greeve (Human)|Greeve]], destroyed its spotlights with a [[Sniper rifle/Legends|sniper rifle]]. The squad circled the walker to keep it off balance, and the group's [[Medic/Legends|medic]], Corporal [[Delevar]], fired a [[Smoke canister/Legends|smoke canister]] into the AT-ST's [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]] [[Window/Legends|window]] when it began firing randomly. The resulting smoke explosion forced the walker's crew to abandon the vehicle and surrender to the strike team. After capturing the Imperials, the squad forced the walker pilot to make a [[Comm unit/Legends|comm]] check-in at [[Blaster/Legends|blasterpoint]]. The squad continued on to the rendezvous point, forcing the walker pilot to make several more check-ins along the way to explain the scout walker's absence.<ref name=\"Night Attack\" />\n\n[[File:Ds2destroyed.png|thumb|right|250px|The strike team's destruction of the deflector shield enabled Rebel starfighters to destroy the second Death Star itself.]]\nSolo and the others then rejoined the squad, having allied themselves with the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Unidentified Ewok tribe|tribe]] of [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]], who showed the [[Commando/Legends|commandos]] a route to the [[Planetary shield/Legends|shield generator]] bunker's backdoor. The commandos proceeded into the structure, only to be ambushed by [[Tempest Force]], the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]] [[Legion/Legends|legion]] stationed on the moon, and subsequently captured and led back outside. Their capture proved short-lived, however, when the Ewoks attacked the Imperial [[Troop/Legends|troops]], eventually turning the tide of the battle in favor of the Rebel Alliance.

Major Derlin met with Aybock, revealing information about Vorne privately auctioning the shockboxer's organs as well as setting up a slicer to disable Aybock's [[GolanGear]] [[Armor/Legends|armor]] during the match to ensure the Calian's [[Death/Legends|death]]. The Intelligence Service's involvement would help the New Republic suspend the Reuss Corporation's operations, which had laid waste to the planet's citizens and environment over the last twenty years. As part of Derlin's team, Beezer's job was to work remotely as a slicer to counter Vorne's efforts. Aybock agreed to help Derlin but only on the condition that the fight with Raine be a fair one and that he be given no advantage by Beezer.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\nThe day of the match, Vorne traced Beezer's signal and sent a [[Defel/Legends|Defel]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] to kill her. However, [[Tisocco]], the team's [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]], successfully defended Beezer from the assassin, which proved to be the mission's only complication. Aybock won the match, and the New Republic's mission succeeded, with the Reuss Corporation's operations suspended pending judiciary investigation and Vorne running from an arrest warrant and several [[Bounty/Legends|bounties]]. The New Republic took over Reuss VIII's government with the intent of returning the planet to its agricultural roots.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|And [I thought] all shockboxers are brain-dead.|Beezer, to Lobar Aybock|Fists of Ion}}\nA slicer and technician, Dansra Beezer became nervous anytime Han Solo tried to hotwire something.<ref name=\"CCG\" /> When first meeting Lobar Aybock, Beezer straightened up as if she had been previously bored right before getting to introduce herself.
