In about [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Hurgen was hired by two [[Caarite]]s that represented a rival firm of the company [[Mothven Star Trading]], and they tasked him with arranging for a package that contained some [[Banthazolate|drugs]] and an explosive device to be delivered to Mothven's headquarters on Cularin. With the aid of some documentation that was supplied to him by the Caarites, Hurgen assumed the identity of [[Frome Eubarus]], an employee of Mothven Star Trading who was away on vacation, and hired some [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] to transport the device to Mothven. A short [[Time/Legends|time]] later, the agents deduced that they had been misled and confronted Hurgen in his apartment on Cularin, and he confessed to them the role that he had played in the deception. Hurgen subsequently [[Death/Legends|died]] several days later in a [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] accident, under mysterious circumstances.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Consignment]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hurgen, Jarett}}\n[[Category:Actors]]\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
