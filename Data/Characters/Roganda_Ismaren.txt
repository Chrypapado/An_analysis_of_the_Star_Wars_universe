In [[18 BBY/Legends|18 BBY]], she and several other younglings were smuggled to [[Plett's Well]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]], under the guidance of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Plett]]. However, their refuge was discovered by [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], who sent the [[dreadnaught]] ''[[Eye of Palpatine]]'' to wipe out the Jedi. Although the weapon was disabled, Roganda was captured by [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Imperial Inquisitors]] during the evacuation of Belsavis. Taken to [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]], Roganda integrated herself into Imperial society, growing into a beautiful woman. Using her good looks and [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]], Roganda was able to infiltrate the exclusive [[Imperial Court/Legends|Imperial Court]], eventually becoming one of the Emperor's concubines. During her time as Palpatine's consort, she began an affair with another court member, [[Sarcev Quest]]. When she became pregnant, Roganda submitted herself to the Emperor's mercy, becoming an [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hand]] and training in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. In [[4 BBY/Legends|4 BBY]], Roganda gave birth to her son, [[Irek Ismaren]], and began to train him as a possible heir to the Emperor. However, upon Palpatine's death in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Roganda did not have the necessary support to make a play for the throne. She retreated back to Belsavis and began to train her son for a future attempt to take control of the Empire.\n\nBy [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]], Roganda had formulated [[Ismaren plot|a plan]] to reunite the fragment of the Empire. Her son, who had been implanted with a [[subelectronic converter]], used this device to summon the disabled ''Eye of Palpatine'' to Belsavis. With the promise of the warship at her command, she made overtures to various [[Noble/Legends|nobles]] in the [[Senex sector/Legends|Senex]] and [[Juvex sector/Legends|Juvex sectors]] to gain backing for her son as the new Emperor. However, when the ship arrived above Belsavis, Irek found that he could not control it, and the plot fell apart. Roganda and her son made their way back to Coruscant, where she continued Irek's training, recruiting [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Cronal]] to train her son. However, in an argument with his teacher, Irek was stabbed through the head with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], rendering him brain-dead. Devastated, Roganda refused to accept the loss of her boy, placing him in [[Suspended animation/Legends|suspended animation]] and trying to repair his brain with [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetics]]. She also augmented him to become the most powerful [[darksider]] imaginable, installing lightsabers in his wrists, elbows, and knees and using growth hormones to increase his size to three [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] in height. In an attempt to bring back Irek's mental faculties, she prepared operational programming and prefabricated memories to install into his destroyed brain. However, before this could be implemented, a [[Groundquake/Legends|groundquake]] awakened Irek from stasis. Driven only by a mindless need to destroy, he used the lightsabers installed into his body to cut his mother to pieces, ending her life.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|If I'd followed the strictest traditions of my family I'd have been destroyed, as they and my older brother Lagan were destroyed.

With this information, Roganda took a large case of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] in the event that their mission failed. As the group readied for their mission, Organa provoked Roganda, causing her to slap the princess, alerting one of the financial backers, Garonnin. Organa called out to the man, claiming that the Ismarens were abandoning Belsavis to the ''Eye of Palpatine''. Irek killed the man with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], and in the chaos, Organa escaped. Irek and Keldor pursued the princess through the tunnels, but the intervention of Han Solo resulted in Keldor's death.<ref name=\"CotJ23\" /> Without Keldor's help, the Ismarens could not fix the ''Eye of Palpatine'', and they were forced to abandon their plans and their potential supporters. Making their way out of the tunnels, Roganda and her son incapacitated the guards watching over Lady Vandron's [[Tikiar (starfighter)/Legends|''Tikiar'']] starship and used it to depart Belsavis. Following their departure, the ''Eye of Palpatine'' arrived above Belsavis, ready to shell the planet to cinders. However, Luke Skywalker and one of his students, [[Cray Mingla]], had activated the self-destruct of the ship, and before it could begin its attack, the battlemoon exploded to the relief of those still on Belsavis.<ref name=\"CotJ24\" />\n\nRoganda made her way to the [[Atravis sector/Legends|Atravis sector]], where heavy concentrations of [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Blitzer Harrsk|Harrsk's]] troops had been reported.

Some of us think that fanatic adherence to every jot and quibble of an antiquated code is, if not dark precisely, at least stupid.

She was a soft-spoken woman with a high-pitched, lisping speech. As Palpatine's concubine, she was trained to carry herself gracefully, and she retained this attribute years after Palpatine's death. The young woman was seen as a great beauty,<ref name=\"CotJ13\" /> which she used to her advantage in the Imperial Court.<ref name=\"TEP47\" /> At high-profile events, Roganda wore elaborate outfits adorned with jewels and precious metals. Her long black hair was woven through with silk and lace. However, upon her departure from Coruscant, Roganda lived simply, wearing plain white dresses and keeping her hair free of ornamentation.<ref name=\"CotJ13\" />\n\nAs a young girl, Roganda witnessed her brother being killed, which badly traumatized her and placed in her a strong desire for power that would keep her from her brother's fate.<ref name=\"TEP47\" /> After becoming a member of Palpatine's court, Roganda became a skilled manipulator, able to deceive those around her and portray herself in many different guises. Her ability to work behind the scenes allowed her to survive the cutthroat atmosphere of Coruscant.<ref name=\"CotJ18\" /> Although Roganda portrayed herself as shy and defenseless, this was an act to keep people underestimating her. Alone and around her son, this personality was replaced with a collected, ambitious attitude. From her time in the Imperial Court, Roganda had been looked down upon for not being of noble birth and a concubine of the Emperor. She remembered these slights many years after departing Coruscant, resenting those that had scorned her. This also added into her desire for power, and the training of her son was an effort to bring them both the power she had always desired.<ref name=\"CotJ23\" /> When Irek was killed by Lord Cronal, Roganda could not accept her son's death, keeping him alive and replacing the damaged parts of his brain with computer parts. Over the years, she became increasingly more deranged, unable to cope with the loss of her boy.<ref name=\"ELII12\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|She doesn't know as much as she thinks she does.|[[Irek Ismaren]]|Children of the Jedi (novel)}}\nRoganda was the daughter of members of the Jedi Order and inherited their Force-sensitivity.<ref name=\"CotJ15\" /> Although she was trained in the Jedi Temple<ref name=\"NEGTC37\" /> and later by Jedi Master Plett,<ref name=\"DSSB\" /> she was still a child when kidnapped by Imperial Inquisitors.<ref name=\"TEP47\" /> However, she was strong enough in the Force to escape the Inquisitors who had captured her.<ref name=\"JvS\" /> Her powers allowed her to infiltrate the Imperial Court and become one of Palpatine's favored concubines.

Somehow, Leia strongly suspected the latter.|Excerpt from ''Children of the Jedi'' by Barbara Hambly|Children of the Jedi (novel)}}\nRoganda Ismaren was created by [[Barbara Hambly]] as the antagonist in the [[1995]] novel, [[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']]. Following the end of the novel, the character and her son escaped and were not seen again in a novel until [[2002]]. ''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]'' by [[Aaron Allston]] detailed Roganda's final fate, killed by her own son. Several reference articles and books expanded Roganda's backstory and detailed her appearances in the novel. One notable reference article, ''[[The Emperor's Pawns]]'' in ''[[Star Wars Gamer 5]]'' gave information on how Roganda had become an Emperor's Hand and a servant of the Emperor. In addition, it also named the true father of Roganda's son, Sarcev Quest, confirming that her son was not Palpatine's . In ''Children of the Jedi'', Leia Organa muses as to how Roganda was turned to the dark side, coming to the conclusion that she must have gone to the Emperor herself after seeing the fate of other Jedi. ''The Emperor's Pawns'' confirmed some of this speculation, clarifying that Roganda had gone to the Emperor after becoming pregnant.\n\n''Children of the Jedi'' was originally dated to [[15 ABY/Legends|15 ABY]] according to Barbara Hambly.<ref name=\"SWG3\">''[[Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3]]''</ref> This date is contradicted in the novel, as Leia Organa claims that she was introduced as a senator 11 years ago. Additionally, several places in the novel claim that Roganda and Irek have been living on Belsavis for 7 years. It also states that Yoda had died \"about seven years ago\". However, [[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']], and later, ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'' dated the novel to [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]]. This movement of the timeline allowed the defeat of the ''Eye of Palpatine'', which had occurred \"thirty years ago\" to happen after the events of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], which was dated to [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]. However, this placement affected Roganda's backstory and some of the ages stated in ''Children of the Jedi''. In the novel, Leia states that Irek is \"fourteen or fifteen years old\", and ''The Essential Guide to Characters'' definitively states that Irek was fourteen at the time of ''Children of the Jedi''. Moving the novel to 12 ABY has rendered some of these dates erroneous.\n\nIn ''Children of the Jedi'', the refugee group that are the namesake of the novel are literally \"Children of the Jedi\", sons and daughters of members of the Jedi Order. Roganda and her brother are stated to be the offspring of Jedi that were escaping the Empire. The novel was written before the release of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] and the revelation that the Jedi Order had a taboo on marriage. However, ''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'', published in [[2002]], [[retcon]]ned the children into [[Youngling/Legends|younglings]] from the [[Jedi Temple]] and stated that Roganda was one of these Jedi children. However, the reference article, ''The Emperor's Pawns'' published in [[2005]], states that Roganda and her brother \"were captured, taken from their parents\", referencing the backstory from the novel. For the purposes of this article, it is assumed that Roganda and her brother were Jedi Initiates, and also the actual children of Jedi.\n\nIn the ''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]'', the entry on Irek Ismaren states that Roganda and her son escaped into the jungles of Belsavis after the destruction of the ''Eye of Palpatine'' and then later booked passage to Coruscant from Belsavis. This directly contradicts ''Children of the Jedi'' which shows the Ismarens commandeering a ship and escaping into the Atravis system.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]'' {{C|Corpse}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Roganda Ismaren}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|8|The Deadly Dozen}}\n*{{GalaxyCite|8|Use the Force|Use the Force: Dark Side Trivia Quiz}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{GamerCite|5|The Emperor's Pawns}}\n*''[[The Dark Side Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' <!--p. 37-->\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/81/indexp7.html|text=Droids, Technology and the Force: A Clash of Phenomena|int=Droids, Technology and the Force: A Clash of Phenomena (article)}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/88/indexp2.html|text=Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties|int=Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties|archivedate=20110629021310}}\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']] <!--p. 146-->\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|callista|Callista|archivedate=20110618102618}}\n*{{DB|character|marajadeskywalker|Skywalker, Mara Jade|archivedate=20110707053858}}\n*{{SW|url=news/barely-tolerable-alien-henchmen-of-the-empire-part-3|text=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 3|int=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Blog|abelgpena|73|The Emperor's Pawns Endnotes, Part 1: Blackhole and Revelations|Only Sith Deal In Absolutes!|Abel G.
