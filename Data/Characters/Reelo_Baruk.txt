Living in [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]], his job was to hire spacers to eliminate Jabba's enemies, such as the [[Alkhara Bandits]] or the [[Valarian gang|Valarians]].<ref name=\"SWG:JPRB\" /> There, he also contacted a local [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to deal with Jabba's [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]] problem.<ref name=\"SWGTCG\" />\n\nBaruk eventually moved to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], and opened a [[Baruk's Bar|bar]] and also began his own criminal empire. Most people just saw him as the head of a [[Reelo Baruk's Garbage Processing Facility|local garbage-hauling company]], but this was not the case. He worked very hard to keep his criminal activity under the radar. His thugs were of many different alien species, and were considered some of the worst scum in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].<ref name=\"JO\" /> He became one of the most respected crime lords in [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]], but kept his business covered up enough that even [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] believed him to be legitimate.<ref name=\"NRIR\">''[[N.R.I. Reports]]''</ref>\n\n===Last stand===\n[[File:Reelogun.jpg|thumb|Reelo shortly before his death]]\nDuring his final years, in [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]], he made a deal with the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Desann]], supplying the [[Empire Reborn]] with thugs for a [[Battle of Bespin (Empire Reborn)|takeover]] of the [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|carbonite freezing chambers]] on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. While [[Mission to Nar Shaddaa (Empire Reborn)|looking for him]] in Nar Shaddaa, [[Kyle Katarn]] discovered [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] in Baruk's hold and eventually found the crime lord. Baruk managed to entrap him in a [[Reelo Baruk's hideout|room]] full of [[Autoturret/Legends|autoturrets]], but the Jedi escaped and freed Lando.<ref name=\"JO\" />\n\nWhile Katarn and Calrissian were about to escape from Nar Shaddaa, Baruk attacked the two men with a handful of mercenaries. The criminal leader used his thugs to board the [[Lady Luck/Legends|''Lady Luck'']], but Katarn killed them all. When the ship was about to depart it malfunctioned, and Reelo and more of his thugs, in a desperate attempt, attacked with Baruk using a gun platform. But Katarn jumped into the laser turret of the ship and shot them all down, including Baruk.<ref name=\"JO\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nReelo first appeared as one of the more major villains in ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast]]'', where his voice was portrayed by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Reelo later appeared in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', as the entrance point to the Jabba The Hutt quests.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Dirty%20Deeds&resource=features|text=Dirty Deeds|archivedate=20060320172245}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|scenario=Those Nasty Tuskens promotional scenario}}\n*''[[N.R.I.
