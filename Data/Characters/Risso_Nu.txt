They would exact their revenge, and he would be able to make a name for himself. Using information he obtained from a [[Kowakian monkey-lizard/Legends|Kowakian monkey-lizard]], he found out where and when Fett would be having his armor serviced, and would be most vulnerable.\n\nThe party consisted of [[Toosog]], [[Eermik]], [[Nagyan]] and [[Mudmub]], along with an [[Unidentified droid bounty hunter (Ma'ar Shaddam)|droid bounty hunter]]. Waiting until they knew Fett to be unarmored and helpless, they raided the weaponsmiths hideaway in a mountain cavern. Although heavily armed, each one fell to an unarmed Fett. The only survivor was Risso, who actually succeeded in stealing the famous [[Mandalorian armor/Legends|Mandalorian armor]]. In a last-second fit of desperation, Risso hijacked Fett's starship, [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']], and used its missiles to destroy the cave.\n\nBelieving Boba Fett had been killed in the explosion, he donned the armor and masqueraded as Fett in a local cantina. His new-found fame was short-lived, however, when the real Boba Fett, very much alive and wearing a spare suit of armor, arrived on the scene and badly beat him before reclaiming the armor and his identity. Boba Fett decided to let him live, to remind the galaxy who was number one.\n\nNu survived to be number two, again. Before Risso escaped the cave, he sustained an insult from Fett, who called him \"Corellian scum.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|18|Number Two in the Galaxy}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Risso Nu\n|pl=Risso Nu\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nu, Risso}}\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
