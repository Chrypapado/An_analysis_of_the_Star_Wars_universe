You know us? -- Well, never mind.|Blerx Tango, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Blerx Tango''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] musician and leader of a band called the [[Dewback Ramblers]].\n\n==Biography==\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Blerx Tango and the Dewback Ramblers operated out of the [[Lucky Star (Mos Entha)|Lucky Star]] [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in [[Mos Entha/Legends|Mos Entha]]. Tango was the leader of the band and played [[Kloo horn/Legends|kloo horn]].<ref name=\"SWG:BT\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> he learned that a fellow band member named [[Jakko Mixon]] got stranded in the desert. Jakko had fallen for an old trick, a scam where he believed he would get a cheap ride to [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]]. Fortunately, Blerx managed to employ the help of a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]], who sought out to find Jakko, and bring him back safely to Mos Entha. However, the troubles had not yet ended for Blerx's band members. His [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Ommni box/Legends|ommni box]] player, [[Mellaw Doowon]], needed to be escorted back safely after making some bad jokes with [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] authorities. Once again, the spacer was tasked to find Mellaw, and bring him back to Blerx. Unfortunately for the spacer, a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] would not let Mellaw be escorted back. The stormtrooper opened fire, forcing the spacer to kill the trooper. Yet the ordeals were not yet over. Another band member, [[Baze Joz]], ended up biting an agent from the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]]. Committed, the spacer sought out Baze Joz, so that he too could be brought back to Jakko. When the spacer approached Baze, he was attacked by three Imperial [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeants]]. The three sergeants were ultimately dispatched by the spacer, allowing him to bring Baze home safely. In addition to the [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] that Blerx provided the spacer, he was also awarded a [[nalargon]] for his service.<ref name=\"SWG:BT\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBlerx Tando was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:MMORPG|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'',<ref name=\"SWG:BT\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> In the game, players aligned with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]] could help Blerx rescue his three band members.<ref name=\"SWG:BT\" />\n\nIt is likely that this Bith musician was intended to be the same as the Bith musician [[Blerx]] from the comic \"[[Nerf Herder]]\".
