While in the slavers' custody Meeva met another young Twi'lek, a male named [[Tror]], who had been sold to the slavers by his parents. A few months after Tror arrived, a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] named [[Vhiin Thorla]] located the slavers' camp and rescued both Meeva and Tror from slavery. Taking both of the young Twi'leks back to [[The Enclave]], a refuge built for former slaves, Master Thorla introduced them to other Twi'leks who had been liberated from a life of slavery. Not long after their arrival, Master Thorla brought another child Twi'lek to the Enclave, a rescued slave named [[Dath]]. The three children became quick friends and were rarely seen without the others' company.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Twi'light Storm]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:The Enclave residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
