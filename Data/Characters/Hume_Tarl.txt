They weren't anything close to cute.|Hume Tarl, to Cindel Towani|The Essential Guide to Warfare}}\n'''Hume Tarl''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], who served in the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Stormtrooper Corps/Legends|Stormtrooper Corps]] after graduating from the [[Corulag Academy|Academy]] on the world [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. Tarl joined the stormtrooper unit [[Tempest Force]] around [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], and later participated in the [[Battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|assault]] on the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] as a part of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a conflict between the Rebels and the Empire. Sometime after [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Tarl, now a [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]], was posted in Corellia's [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]], where he was helped by a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who captured [[Dina Whisper]], one of Tarl's informants whom he suspected of betraying him, and disabled a small [[Black market/Legends|black market]]. After six [[Standard year/Legends|years]] in Tempest Force, Tarl took part in the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], where he [[Ground warfare|fought against]] both native [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] and Rebels seeking to destroy the Empire's [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II]]. Tarl survived the battle, and years later, he was interviewed by the [[Journalist/Legends|journalist]] [[Cindel Towani]] for her work ''[[Portraits of the Galactic Civil War]]'', released in [[41 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Stormtrooper===\n{{Quote|I served six years in Tempest Force, rising to sergeant.

I might have just the task for you.|Hume Tarl|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nSometime after 0 BBY, Tarl, now a [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeant]], was stationed on his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]]. During his work in Coronet City, Tarl came to suspect that [[Dina Whisper]], a female informant of his, was selling sensitive information to the Rebels.<ref name=\"swg\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref>\n{{Gamemechanics}}\n[[File:HumeTarl.jpg|thumb|left|250px|200px|Sergeant Hume Tarl, during his service in Coronet City]]\nAs Tarl was unable to trust the informant, he commissioned the help of a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] affiliated with the Empire. Though the spacer asked about the details of Whisper's betrayal, Tarl remained vague. Faithfully fulfilling the contract, the spacer apprehended Whisper outside the city, with Whisper later being taken into Imperial custody. With the contract complete, Tarl paid the spacer {{Cr}}100.<ref name=\"swg\" />\n\nTarl discovered the existence of a small [[Black market/Legends|black market]] outside of Coronet due to the interrogation of Whisper. Once again enlisting the help of the spacer, Tarl charged the individual with shutting down the illegal operation. However, the sergeant also threatened the spacer that the individual would be imposed with charges of [[Treason/Legends|treason]] if the mission were not done exactly to his expectations.<ref name=\"swg\" />\n\nEventually, the spacer agreed to take out the outpost. During the spacer's disabling of the black market, the spacer encountered the [[Unidentified black market profiteer|person]] who ran the place, a profiteer who adamantly opposed Imperial authority. During the ensuing fight, the spacer [[Death/Legends|killed]] the individual. After the destruction of the black market, Tarl congratulated the spacer for completing the assignment in the service of the Empire. The sergeant then directed the spacer to seek further work with Imperial [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]].<ref name=\"swg\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n===Deployment and fighting on Endor===\n{{Quote|And then it happened&mdash;the indigenes attacked&hellip;They knew every tree and rock, and they picked us off one by one.|Hume Tarl|The Essential Guide to Warfare}}\nDuring the course of six years with Tempest Force, Tarl saw action on the worlds of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], [[Marcelan Prime]], [[Sarko VI|Sarko]], and [[Aurimaus]], as well as other obscure locations. Due to the Empire's construction of the massive [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II]] above the [[Forest/Legends|Forest]] [[Moon/Legends|Moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], Tarl and Tempest Force were deployed on the moon for nine [[Standard month/Legends|months]], during which Tarl was occasionally on leave at the world of [[Annaj/Legends|Annaj]]. Besides the Imperial presence on Endor, the moon was also inhabited by [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]], short [[Hair/Legends|hairy]] bipeds, which Tempest Force's survey teams had discovered during their thorough surveys. To Tarl, the Ewoks seemed to be afraid of the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield generator bunker]] Tempest Force was posted to defend, and they did not bother the Imperials.<ref name=\"egtw\" />\n\n[[File:VictoryOnEndor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|200px|The Ewoks attack.]]\nIn [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> Tarl and Tempest Force shined up their [[Plastoid/Legends|plastoid]] [[Stormtrooper armor/Legends|Stormtrooper armor]] and were deployed aboard a [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] in the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] for the arrival of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], who was the supreme leader of the Empire. Shortly after returning to Endor, the whole of Tempest Force was put on high alert due to both the disappearance of a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] patrol, and the knowledge that Rebel [[Agent/Legends|agents]] were on the moon. Tarl was later present when one of the Rebels turned himself in to the Empire, and watched as the Rebel&mdash;who was actually important Rebel member [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]&mdash;was taken by the Imperial [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]<ref name=\"egtw\" /> before being transported to the Death Star aboard a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|shuttle]].<ref name=\"Jedi\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref>\n\nA day after the Rebel was captured, Rebels forces [[Battle of Endor/Legends|attacked]], with a [[Endor strike team/Legends|Rebel ground force]] attempting to knock out the Endor [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator/Legends|shield generator]] bunker, which protected the Death Star via a [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shield]]. This would then enable the [[Alliance Fleet|Rebel fleet]] in orbit to destroy the now unprotected Death Star. Tarl and Tempest Force captured the Rebel [[Ground warfare|ground force]] members after they had infiltrated the back entrance of the shield generator, and Tarl himself exited the shield generator while guarding the captured Rebels.<ref name=\"Jedi\" /> The Ewoks then attacked, and Tarl watched as the Rebel&ndash;allied Ewoks cut down Imperials one by one with [[Arrow/Legends|arrows]], [[Knife/Legends|knives]] and [[axe]]s. Stormtroopers chasing Ewoks ended up in pitfall traps filled with spikes while Ewoks wielding [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] obtained from fallen Imperials killed other stormtroopers. Sergeant Tarl managed to survive the fighting,<ref name=\"egtw\" /> though the battle ended in a Rebel victory, with the Death Star destroyed and [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] Palpatine and Vader both killed.<ref name=\"Jedi\" />\n\nYears later, Tarl was interviewed by the [[Journalist/Legends|journalist]] [[Cindel Towani]] and told her of the events that happened on Endor. In the interview, Tarl expressed his disgust at how the Rebels, who had by then formed the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], did not count the Ewoks' massacring of Tempest Force as an atrocity. Tarl's interview was included in Towani's work ''[[Portraits of the Galactic Civil War]]'', released in [[41 ABY]].<ref name=\"egtw\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|The historians love to talk about alleged Imperial atrocities, but what about what I saw on the Forest moon? They slaughtered us like animals, Miss Towani. Shouldn't that be counted as an atrocity?|Hume Tarl|The Essential Guide to Warfare}}\nTarl remained vague when the spacer asked him about the specific details regarding Whisper, and was later strict with the spacer, threatening the individual with charges of treason if the black market assignment did not go according to plan.<ref name=\"CCG\" /> Tarl also considered Tempest Force as one of the finest [[Legion/Legends|legions]] in the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], and thought Annaj was only interesting for those who had been stationed on the boring moon of Endor. Tarl thought he and Tempest Force were protecting their Emperor during his stay on the Death Star, and during the arrival of Palpatine, his [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] were drawn to the Emperor even across the hangar.<ref name=\"egtw\" />\n\nWhen Tarl saw Skywalker, whom he thought was short, the sergeant did not recognize that the Rebel Jedi was Luke Skywalker. Tarl also figured that even though Skywalker informed Vader he was alone, there had to be more Rebels on the moon as one Jedi could not take out an entire biker patrol.<ref name=\"egtw\" /> After capturing the Rebels in the shield generator and hearing that the Rebel fleet was failing in their attack, Tarl and Tempest Force believed that the Rebellion was doomed.<ref name=\"Marvel\">[[Return of the Jedi 4|''Return of the Jedi'' 4]]</ref>\n\nThe stormtrooper considered most natives beggars or thieves. However, initially Tarl reckoned that the Ewok natives were not like most natives, and as they were not causing problems, would not have to be excised from around the generator. He also thought that the Ewoks were afraid of the shield generator. Tarl did not find the Ewoks who slaughtered his legion cute as the rest of the New Republic did, and had not thought they would be a problem until the Ewoks attacked the Imperials. He also thought the directors of the [[Hologram/Legends|holo]]-thrillers depicting Ewoks should admit that they were paid to tell New Republic lies as they made the Ewoks look cute in their works. Tarl questioned why [[Historian/Legends|historians]] loved to talk about Imperial atrocities, but did not count the slaughtering of Tempest Force as one.<ref name=\"egtw\" /> As an Imperial stormtrooper, Tarl wore a set of [[Color/Legends|white]] stormtrooper [[Armor/Legends|armor]] and wielded an [[E-11 blaster rifle/Legends|E-11 blaster rifle]].<ref name=\"Jedi\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHume Tarl first appeared as an unnamed stormtrooper in [[1983]]'s film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']].<ref name=\"Jedi\" /> He was finally identified as Tarl in ''[[Endor Limited]]'', a [[1999]] expansion for the [[Star Wars Customizable Card Game|''Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game]].<ref name=\"CCG\" /> The sergeant appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in [[2003]]'s [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]].<ref name=\"swg\" /> On [[December 15]] [[2011]], the game was shut down.<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8601159/Star-Wars-Galaxies-MMORPG-to-close-this-year.html|title=Star Wars Galaxies MMORPG to close this year|date=2011-06-27, 3:42 pm BST|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|quote=Sony, who created the game, announced via email and the game's support forum and website that the online game will be closed on 15 December [2011].|archivedate=20160324060142}}</ref> Players who performed a series of [[W:c:swg:Quest|quests]] for Sergeant Tarl had to apprehend Dina Whisper and bring her to Coronet, as well as kill the profiteer of the black market outside of the city.
