You do indeed have much to bargain with, to insure my assistance in tracking down this sister of yours who has strayed so mysteriously from her homeworld.|Kuat of Kuat|Slave Ship}}\n'''Kodir of Kuhlvult''' was named [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]]' head of security after she revealed the last head of security, [[Fenald]], to be a [[Spy/Legends|spy]]. Although she revealed the [[Gender/Legends|man]] to be a spy, she herself was no better as she had deposed the last head only to further her own agenda. However, not long after she took the post, her sister, [[Kateel of Kuhlvult]], reappeared, saying she remembered everything. Including the fact that Kodir had been the one who had betrayed her and ordered her mind to be brutally [[Memory wipe/Legends|wiped]] of all of its memories. Kodir was taken into custody to face a tribunal of elders from the [[The Ten|ruling Kuati families]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Slave Ship]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Hard Merchandise]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Kodir de Kuhlvult\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kuat Drive Yards personnel]]\n[[Category:Kuati]]"}}}]}}}}
