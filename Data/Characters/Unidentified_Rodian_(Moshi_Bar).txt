He was seen watching a [[Unidentified Twi'lek (Coruscant bar)|Twi'lek dancer]] with a [[Unidentified Quarren (Coruscant bar)|male Quarren]] while they argued about who she would go out with. When [[Fong Do/Legends|Fong Do]] and a [[Unidentified Weequay pirate (Moshi Bar)/Legends|Weequay pirate]] caught Ahsoka eavesdropping, this Rodian pulled out a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], along with everyone else, but hesitated firing after Plo ignited his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].
