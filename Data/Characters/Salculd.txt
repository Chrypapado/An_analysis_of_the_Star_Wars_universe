She might act odd from time to time. Pay no attention, and don't be alarmed.|[[Dracmus]]|Assault at Selonia}}\n'''Salculd''' was a [[Gender/Legends|sterile female]] [[Selonian/Legends|Selonian]] with sleek black fur everywhere except her belly, which was light brown. She was a member of the [[Hunchuzuc Den]] living on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. She was bred to be a pilot and flew primitive [[Selonian cone ship]]s. Though Selonians are honest by nature, Salculd was more up front about her opinions than most, and she also occasionally made wisecracks.\n\nDuring the [[Corellian Crisis|First Corellian Insurrection]], Salculd and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] did their best to keep their cone ship from falling apart on its trip to [[Selonia/Legends|Selonia]]. The ship was commanded by [[Dracmus]], who was largely unfamiliar with maneuvering a starship and sometimes gave commands that might have placed the crew in danger. When Han convinced Dracmus to defer to his expertise, Salculd was noticeably relieved.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Assault at Selonia]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0421\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0434\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:New Republic Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Selonians]]"}}}]}}}}
