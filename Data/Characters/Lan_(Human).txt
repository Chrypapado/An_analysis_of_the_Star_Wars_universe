I don't want to.|Lan|Rebel Force: Hostage}}\n'''Lan''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. The day before Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], Lan went to Alderaan's sister planet [[Delaya/Legends|Delaya]] with his friends, [[Mazi]] and [[Jez (Human)|Jez]], to watch a [[Smashball/Legends|smashball]] tournament. Following his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld's]] destruction, Lan and his friends resorted to thievery in order to survive. They tried to rob [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who was visiting Delaya to help the Alderaanian refugee efforts, but were dissuaded by [[Ferus Olin]], a former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. When Organa was captured by a rogue Alderaanian faction that blamed her for their world's demise, it was Lan's friend Mazi who told Organa's companions where the faction's hideout was. After Organa was rescued, Lan and his friends decided to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] as [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|There was a smashball tournament on Delaya. We got permission to go to the game, stay overnight on our own, then go back to Alderaan in the morning.''\"<br />\"''But that was the day&mdash;''\"<br />\"''Yeah. That was the day. So here we are. On our own.|Mazi and Han Solo on Alderaan's destruction|Rebel Force: Hostage}}\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Lan lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. The day before Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], Lan went to see a [[Smashball/Legends|smashball]] tournament on [[Delaya/Legends|Delaya]]&mdash;Alderaan's sister planet&mdash;with his friends [[Mazi]] and [[Jez (Human)|Jez]]. Despite Lan's young age, Mazi was able to convince Lan's parents to allow him to go. [[Lan's mother]], who worried a lot, thought that the three of them were too young to go on their own. However, his [[Lan's father|father]] was easily convinced and the three friends made the trip.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\n[[File:Alderaan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Alderaan, Lan's homeworld]]\nAfter Alderaan was destroyed, Lan and his companions were left to fend for themselves, surviving on Delaya by becoming thieves. [[Ferus Olin]], a former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and another survivor of Alderaan, tried to dissuade them from turning to crime by giving them various small jobs to earn [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\nWhen [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] made a visit to Delaya to assist the refugee effort and recruit new members on behalf of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], Lan, along with Mazi and Jez, attempted to rob Organa. [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who was one of the individuals accompanying Organa at that time, tried to placate the orphans but was unsuccessful. The standoff was broken when Olin arrived at the scene and disarmed Mazi&mdash;who was holding Organa at knife-point with a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]]&mdash;by shooting the vibroblade away with his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. After being told by Olin that he would stop giving them errands if they continued getting into trouble, Lan and his friends ran away.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\nWhen Organa was captured by a rogue Alderaanian faction that blamed her for the destruction of their world, Lan and his group provided Solo and Organa's other companions the location of the ringleader's hideout. The information eventually led Solo and the others to successfully rescue Organa from the Empire, to whom she was handed over by the faction for a reward. Olin surmised that the orphans, who were willing to do anything for credits and knew where the faction ringleaders were hiding, might have been hired by the faction to rob and capture Organa previously.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\nAfter Organa's rescue, Lan and his friends spoke with a Rebel recruiter and decided to join the Alliance as [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]]. They eagerly told Solo&mdash;whom they had grown quite fond of&mdash;the news, hoping to impress him. The orphans were scheduled to be shipped that night and Solo wished them luck, although he thought Lan and his companions were too young to serve in the Alliance.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What gives, Captain Solo? Mazi said you'd be impressed.|Lan to Han Solo, on joining the Rebel Alliance|Rebel Force: Hostage}}\nDespite his young age, Lan displayed bravery and loyalty to his friends. When Han Solo confronted Lan and his friends on Deyala, Lan, along with Jez, refused to leave Mazi, who was in Solo's grasp, behind. It was Solo's observation that they were terrified of him and were putting on a brave front, which earned his grudging admiration. As a result of Alderaan being destroyed, Lan and his friends became orphans overnight and had to look out for each other. Mazi became the unofficial leader due to his age, and Lan, being the youngest of the three, started looking up to Mazi with something close to hero worship. When Solo didn't turn them in to the authorities for trying to rob Organa, the orphans began yearning to impress the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]].<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLan was a character created by author [[Alex Wheeler]] for the [[2008]] novel ''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'', the second volume in the ''[[Star Wars: Rebel Force]]'' series.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
