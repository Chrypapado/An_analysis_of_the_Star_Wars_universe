He was dispatched to the [[Lothal system]] where a [[Spectres|rebel]] movement occurred. After the Spectres joined the rebellion, Konstantine continued to hunt them down under the command of [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus]] and the [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] known as the [[Fifth Brother]]. Despite their efforts and superior resources, the rebels proved elusive for Konstantine and his comrades.\n\nKonstantine's failed attempts to stamp out the rebellion led [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] to solicit the services of [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], a seasoned tactician and the commander of the [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]]. In an effort to test the Admiral's talents and capabilities, Thrawn dispatched Konstantine on a mission to destroy the [[Iron Squadron]], a rebel cell based at [[Mykapo]]. Konstantine managed to trap the Squadron's [[captain]], [[Mart Mattin]], but underestimated the ingenuity of the Spectres and Mart's uncle [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]]. Konstantine was greatly embarrassed by this [[Skirmish over Mykapo|skirmish]], and attempted to spin the incident in a positive way. However, Thrawn saw through his obfuscation.\n\nSome time later, Konstantine, commanding an [[Interdictor vessel]], accompanied Thrawn and Pryce at the [[Battle of Atollon]]. Consumed by his arrogance and jealousy, Konstantine pursued the [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier]] ''[[Phoenix Nest]]'', defying Thrawn's direct orders of holding back. This maneuver cost Konstantine his life as Sato rammed ''Phoenix Home'' into the Interdictor, destroying both cruisers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nKassius Konstantine was born on [[Coruscant]] during the [[Republic Era|twilight]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. He studied at the prestigious [[Anaxes War College]] on [[Anaxes]] and graduated mere months after the end of the [[Clone Wars]], with a commission in the [[Imperial Navy]]. As one of the first generation of [[Imperial Officer Corps|naval officers]] serving under the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]], he and his colleagues were responsible for much of the fleet's operational standards and culture.<ref name=\"DoR\" />\n\n===Hunting the Spectres===\n====Working with the Grand Inquisitor====\nIn the [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Kassius Konstantine commanded the [[Lothal sector fleet]] from his flagship, the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Relentless]]''. Though primarily an anti-[[Smuggler|smuggling]] task force, the fleet was forced to deal with a sharp rise in insurgent activity in the sector.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" /><ref name=\"DoR\" /> Konstantine worked to capture the ''[[Ghost]]'', a [[starship]] crewed by rebels known as the [[Spectres]]; in these effort, he cooperated with the [[Inquisitorius]], who specifically sought to neutralize the [[Jedi]] [[Kanan Jarrus]].<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" /> After the Spectres rescued another fugitive, the [[Rodian]] [[Imperial Information Office]] staffer [[Tseebo]], and breached the Imperial security cordon around the [[planet]] [[Lothal]]'s [[Capital City]], Konstantine commanded the ''Relentless'' in the pursuit of the rebels. With Tseebo's help, the rebels escaped into [[hyperspace]]. While Konstantine thought of shifting the blame for the rebels' escape to [[the Grand Inquisitor]], he decided against it, as the Emperor's agent had succeeded in planting a [[Homing beacon|tracking device]] onto the hull of the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Ezra's Duel with Danger\">''[[Ezra's Duel with Danger]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:KonstantineAndGrandInquisitor-SWRS01E09.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Admiral Konstantine and the Inquisitor commanded Imperial efforts to hunt down the Spectres]]\nWhen Admiral Konstantine reported that they were receiving a signal from the tracker, the Inquisitor did not acknowledge his presence but merely commented that he himself could sense the [[Jedi]] [[Kanan Jarrus]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]]. In response to the Inquisitor's comments, Konstantine stifled a laugh, as he believed that the Empire had wiped out the Jedi years ago during the [[Great Jedi Purge]]. He was personally skeptical of reports that the leader of that rebel cell was a Jedi. However, the Inquisitor read his emotions and scowled back at the Admiral. Fearing that his long and storied career would end if he failed to capture the rebels, he vowed that they would succeed.<ref name=\"Ezra's Duel with Danger\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the Spectres realized that there was a tracking device planted onto the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary vessel, the ''[[Phantom]]''. To prevent the Imperials from capturing Tseebo, Kanan and Ezra separated from the ''Ghost'' and flew the ''Phantom'' to an [[Fort Anaxes|outpost]] on the planetoid [[PM-1203]]<ref name=\"Ezra's Duel with Danger\" />&mdash;a [[Anaxes asteroid belt|remnant]] of the [[Destruction of Anaxes|destroyed]] planet Anaxes, where Konstantine had previously studied.<ref name=\"DoR\" /> As planned, Konstantine took the bait and initially ordered the deployment of a full battalion, though he would be countermanded by the Inquisitor, who would personally led a small contingent of [[stormtrooper]]s to the surface. Despite the contingent and the Inquisitor's own [[lightsaber]] proficiency, Kanan and Ezra managed to escape with the aid of the native [[fyrnock]]s, leaving both the Inquisitor and Admiral Konstantine empty-handed.<ref name=\"Ezra's Duel with Danger\" />\n\n====Further encounters with the ''Ghost''====\nReturning with the ''Relentless'' to Lothal, Konstantine again encountered the ''Ghost'' when it attempted to smuggle a \"galactic entrepreneur\" [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] and his [[puffer pig]] onto the planet, in the interest of an illegal mining operation. Using a [[signature modulator]], the rebels were able to disguise the ''Ghost'' as the ''[[Tontine]]'', a legitimate [[VCX-100 light freighter]] traveling from [[Boz Pity]]. However, the rebels accidentally deactivated the signature modulator and exposed the ''Ghost'' to the Imperial authorities. Konstantine then dispatched four [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter]]s after the ''Ghost'', but the rebels managed to lose their Imperial pursuers in Lothal's cloudy skies.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ImperialFleetMustafar-FAtG.png|thumb|left|250px|Konstantine effectively commanded the Imperial flotilla at Mustafar]]\nFollowing the Inquisitor's capture of Kanan Jarrus sometime later, Konstantine was temporarily reassigned to [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]'s flagship, the ''[[Sovereign]]'', while over the [[planet]] [[Mustafar]]. Jarrus escaped with the assistance of [[Phoenix Squadron]], a [[rebel cell]] of [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]]s;  in the course of a [[lightsaber]] duel against the Grand Inquisitor, Jarrus and the Spectres were able to destroy the ''Sovereign''.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref> Both Tarkin and Konstantine survived, however, and took part in the [[Siege of Lothal|blockade]] of [[Lothal]] intended to ensnare the Spectres and their new allies in the wider [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|rebellion]].<ref name=\"TSOL\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>\n\n===Fighting Phoenix Squadron===\n====A wider rebellion====\n[[File:SWR_Konstantine_Fleet.png|thumb|right|250px|The sector fleet's blockade of Lothal effectively placed the planet under siege]]\nDespite Konstantine's blockade of the Lothal, the Spectres again evaded capture, this time through [[masking transponder]]s emitting false signals. Nevertheless, Konstantine and the ''Relentless'' launched a surprise attack on the [[Phoenix Cell]], led by [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], who was piloting a [[TIE Advanced x1]] [[starfighter]]. As the ''Ghost'' made its escape, Konstantine activated his Destroyer's [[tractor beam]] to attempt to catch them. However, he instead ended up catching Vader as the rebels jumped to [[hyperspace]]. Knowing that his life was in danger for this mistake, Konstantine blamed his failure on a subordinate bridge officer.<ref name=\"TSOL\" />\n\nAdmiral Konstantine retained his command of the ''Relentless'' despite his failure in Vader's eyes, now hunting for the Phoenix Squadron and accompanied by the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus]] (who also had experience dealing with the Spectres). Under instructions from former Jedi Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]], a [[Fulcrum]] agent associated with the Phoenix Cell, the Spectres had traveled to the desert planet of [[Seelos]] in the [[Kwymar sector]], in an attempt to recruit several retired [[Clone trooper]]s&mdash;[[Rex]], [[Wolffe]], and [[Gregor]]&mdash;to their cause. Wolffe, distrusting the rebels, secretly sent a coded transmission that was picked up by the ''Relentless''; a [[probe droid]] sent to Seelos confirmed the rebel presence there.<ref name=\"TLC\">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref><ref name=\"DoR\" /> While Agent Kallus led a ground assault with three [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]], Admiral Konstantine remained aboard the ''Relentless'' to render air support to Kallus' forces. However, the clones and rebels put up an unexpectedly fierce fight and immobilized Kallus' AT-AT walkers. The Admiral was unable to render air support because Darth Vader had ordered him to rendezvous the ''Relentless'' with his [[shuttle]] in space.<ref name=\"ROTOR\">{{Rebels|Relics of the Old Republic}}</ref>\n\n====Serving the Inquisitorius====\n[[File:Kallus_and_Kassius_watch_the_5th_Brother.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Konstantine and Kallus watch as the Fifth Brother departs to the medical station]]\nInstead of meeting Vader, Admiral Konstantine received another [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] known as the [[Fifth Brother]], who became his new superior. When Konstantine raised his concerns that the diversion might have compromised Agent Kallus' mission, the Inquisitor merely replied that his struggles were of no concern to him and pledged to stop the rebels himself.<ref name=\"ROTOR\" />\n\nSometime later, the ''Relentless'' picked up a surge of energy at an abandoned medical station. This surge had been triggered by several members of the [[Spectres]], though the Fifth Brother informed the Admiral and Kallus that he would visit the station alone. There, the Fifth Brother and another Inquisitor known as the [[Seventh Sister]] almost succeeded in apprehending [[C1-10P|Chopper]], [[Ezra Bridger]], and [[Sabine Wren]]. However, due to [[Garazeb Orrelios]]' quick thinking, the four rebels managed to escape the two Inquisitors.<ref name=\"ATTA\">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>\n\nThough Konstantine chafed working with the Inquisitors, the partnership bore fruit when they discovered on [[Takobo]] that the Phoenix Cell was in hiding on [[Garel]],<ref name=\"Legacy\">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref> a shipping world in the Lothal sector.<ref name=\"DoR\" /> Under Kallus' direction, Konstantine and the Inquisitors prepared for a strike on the world.\n\n[[File:Ghost_knocks_out_tractor_beam.png|thumb|right|250px|Admiral Konstantine commanded the Imperial Navy's assault on Garel]]\nThe Imperial flotilla quickly established aerial superiority, managing to shoot down a rebel [[Taylander shuttle]]. Despite this, several rebel ships, including the Spectres' ship the ''[[Ghost]]'' and [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]]'s [[CR90 corvette]], managed to escape into the skies above [[Garel City]], forcing the ''Relentless'' to deploy its [[tractor beam projector]] to trap Commander Sato's corvette. However, [[Phoenix Leader]] [[Hera Syndulla]] used the ''Ghost'' to ram the tractor beam projector, knocking it out of action (as well as a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] that collided with it). This distraction enabled the Phoenix rebel fleet to make a jump into [[hyperspace]]. When Agent Kallus, who had led the ground assault, demanded an update on the location of the rebel fleet, a visibly frustrated Admiral Konstantine reported that he and his men were also wondering the same thing; despite having flushed them out of hiding, Konstantine had again failed to crush the Phoenix cell.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n====Continued failures====\n[[File:Attack_on_the_rebel_fleet.png|thumb|left|250px|Konstantine's Star Destroyer attacking the rebel fleet]]\nAdmiral Konstantine and Agent Kallus again encountered the ''Ghost'' above [[Nixus]], though the Spectres evaded their [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]]. With the help of the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]], the Imperials managed to track the ''Ghost'' down to a collapsed [[Star cluster/Legends|star cluster]] in [[Wild Space]], where they were searching for the legendary [[Lasat]] homeworld of [[Lira San]]. The Imperials attempted to pursue and destroy the ''Ghost'' but were forced to retreat due to the gravitational pull of the star cluster.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\">{{Rebels|Legends of the Lasat}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Relentless'' again managed to locate and [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron|engage]] Phoenix Squadron, attempting to prevent them from replenishing their [[fuel]] supplies and escaping to a new base. When one of his subordinates reported that the ''Ghost'' was exiting hyperspace with [[Heist at Horizon Base|stolen]] fuel from [[Horizon Base]], Konstantine ordered his [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] not to let the ship dock with the rebel [[Phoenix Nest|flagship]], a former Imperial [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier]] that had been stolen on [[Ryloth]]. Despite their best efforts, Konstantine's TIE fighters were chased away by [[Ketsu Onyo]]'s starship ''[[Shadow Caster]]''. Later, the rebel fleet escaped to [[Atollon]] with the help of the former Imperial [[inventory droid]] [[AP-5]], who informed the rebels of an Imperial trap in the [[Yost system]].<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\">{{Rebels|The Forgotten Droid}}</ref>\n\n===New leadership===\n====Meeting Thrawn====\n[[File:Thrawn_speaks_to_Imperials.png|thumb|right|250px|Konstantine meeting with Thrawn and other Imperial officials]]\nDissatisfied with Admiral Konstantine's handling of the rebel insurgency in the [[Lothal sector]], [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] met with Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and secured the services of the newly appointed [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] and his [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]]. Later, Konstantine met with Grand Moff Tarkin and Agent Kallus on the bridge of a Star Destroyer. Konstantine told Tarkin that Pryce was overestimating the threat posed by the Phoenix rebels and dismissed them as a localized insurgency. At that point, Thrawn interjected and expressed his hopes that the insurgency would remain that way. Konstantine was present when Thrawn theorized that the Phoenix rebels were planning to raid [[Reklam Station]] in the planet [[Yarma]]. Later, Konstantine, Pryce, and Kallus commanded a Star Destroyer that intercepted the rebels and their stolen [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing starfighters]]. He expressed surprise when Thrawn ordered the Imperials to allow the Phoenix rebels to escape with their \"meager reward.\" However, Pryce reassured him that Thrawn's objective was much larger than a single rebel cell.<ref name=\"Steps\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>\n\n====Investigating Agamar====\nLater, Admiral Konstantine was aboard the bridge of an Imperial Star Destroyer with Governor Pryce and Agent Kallus. He informed Pryce that his crew had detected an encrypted distress signal from the planet [[Agamar]]. Pryce then dispatched Imperial forces from the nearest garrison to investigate Agamar, bringing them into conflict with members of the Phoenix Squadron and a [[Separatist holdouts|Separatist holdout]] led by the [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] [[Kalani]]. However, his forces again failed to capture the rebels.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\">{{Rebels|The Last Battle}}</ref>\n\n====Test above Mykapo====\n{{Quote|No, Admiral, I want you to handle it yourself. A single light cruiser should be sufficient for a man of your talents.''\"<br>\"''You would send me? In one ship?''\"<br>\"''Unless you're not&hellip; up to it.''\"<br>\"''I will leave immediately.|Thrawn and Konstantine|Iron Squadron (episode)}}\nGrand Admiral Thrawn had tasked Konstantine with the elimination a local rebel cell on [[Mykapo]], known as the [[Iron Squadron]]. Despite his protests, Thrawn dispatched the Admiral with a single ''Arquitens''-class light cruiser and two [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruisers]], replying that a man of Konstantine's talents should have no difficulty even with one light cruiser. By the time Konstantine had arrived, Phoenix Group had already evacuated the rebel sympathizers among the population.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\n[[File:Satos_Hammer_and_Phantom_II.png|230px|left|thumb|Konstantine's target at Mykapo was Iron Squadron's single YT-2400]]\nUpon arriving, Konstantine's subordinate sighted a [[Sato's Hammer|single]] [[YT-2400 light freighter]]. Despite his previous caution, the Admiral now believed that Thrawn had overestimated the threat posed by the rebel cell and dispatched fighters to attack the ship. The freighter's inexperienced [[captain]], [[Mart Mattin]], moved to attack the light cruiser and released his cargo of explosives; Konstantine was able to neutralize them by unleashing his ship's forward batteries. Mart attempted to flee, but Konstantine's TIE fighters disabled his engines. However, Konstantine's forces were unable to stop his fellow crew, along with Spectres [[Ezra Bridger]], [[Sabine Wren]], and [[C1-10P]], from escaping the [[Mykapo system|system]] aboard the [[shuttle]] ''[[Phantom II]]''. In a ploy to lure the Spectres back into a trap, Konstantine allowed Mattin to send a distress signal while [[TIE/sa bomber|TIE bombers]] attached a [[magno-mine]] to the hull of ''[[Sato's Hammer]]''.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nWhen the Spectres returned aboard the ''Ghost'', Konstantine ordered his subordinate to await his command to trigger the mine, intending to destroy the two rebel ships in one fell swoop. However, through the action of rebel [[astromech droid]]s C1-10P and [[R3-A3]], the rebels were able to stealthily detached the magno-mine and plant it on one of the YT-2400's cargo boxes. The plan was further complicated by the arrival of Phoenix Squadron under [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]] (Mattin's uncle). Sato's reinforcements destroyed one of Konstantine's ''Gozanti'' cruisers and several TIEs, causing Konstantine to panic and call Thrawn for reinforcements. In the chaos, the two rebel ships flew over Konstantine's cruiser, dislodging the cargo box at the same moment that Konstantine ordered the mine triggered. The resulting explosion badly damaged Konstantine's ship. Konstantine and the officer survived the blast but their ship was badly damaged.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\n[[File:Iron_Squadron_26.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Konstantine's failure at Mykapo was a major embarrassment]]\nAt that point, Thrawn arrived in the system. Thrawn allowed the rebels to escape following a brief exchange with Commander Sato. Thrawn then contacted Konstantine via [[hologram]]. When Thrawn asked him whether he had contacted him for assistance, Konstantine tried to save face by claiming that he had called to inform him that the rebels had been driven from system. However, Thrawn saw through Konstantine's obfuscation and replied that he had assumed that the rebels and their sympathizers had escaped. Konstantine bowed his head in embarrassment.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\n====Flushing out a traitor====\nDuring Thrawn's investigation into the rebel [[spy]] known as [[Fulcrum]], Admiral Konstantine was stationed aboard the Grand Admiral's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Chimaera]]''. He introduced Agent Kallus and [[Lieutenant]] [[Yogar Lyste]] to Thrawn and the Imperial Security Bureau [[Colonel]] [[Wullf Yularen]]. Konstantine was present at a meeting where Thrawn briefed the others about Fulcrum, a traitor in the ranks who had been aiding Phoenix Squadron as a spy and saboteur, who Thrawn attributed the recent Imperial defeats and Rebel successes to, and explained his plan to screen the Lothal Sector's Command staff for Rebel affiliations. Konstantine was also privy to Thrawn's plan to hunt down Phoenix Squadron's [[Chopper Base|base]] in the [[Lothal sector]]. When he asked about Thrawn's tactics, the Grand Admiral replied that he had calculated the possible locations of the rebel bases based on their proximity to attacks on Imperial ships and facilities, and the planet Lothal. After Kallus had apprehended Lyste, accusing him of being the Rebel spy, Konstantine was present at a meeting with Governor Pryce, Colonel Yularen, Thrawn and Kallus. There, he congratulated Kallus for catching the spy.<ref name=\"TIE\">{{Rebels|Through Imperial Eyes}}</ref>\n\n====The fugitive senator====\nLater, Admiral Konstantine attended a briefing with Governor Pryce and Grand Admiral Thrawn to discuss plans to capture the fugitive former [[Senator]] [[Mon Mothma]], who had incurred the wrath of [[Darth Sidious|the Emperor]] for denouncing the [[Ghorman Massacre]] and calling the Emperor a \"lying executioner.\" At the briefing, both Konstantine and Pryce expressed disbelief when Thrawn theorized that [[Phoenix Leader]] [[Hera Syndulla]] would use the dangerous [[Archeon pass]] to smuggle Mothma out of the sector. When Pryce volunteered for the \"honor\" of silencing the rogue Senator, Thrawn tasked both Konstantine and Pryce with intercepting the rebel ships outside the [[Archeon Nebula]]. Thrawn's plan was to use his prototype [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|TIE Defender]] and two [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE Interceptors]] to flush the rebels out of the nebula so that they could be captured by Konstantine and Pryce. For that mission, Konstantine and Pryce commanded two Imperial Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\">{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BurningStarDestroyers.png|thumb|250px|left|Konstantine's failure at the Archeon Nebula allowed the formation of the Rebel Alliance]]\nWhen the rebel ship ''[[Ghost]]'' exited the Archeon Nebula, Konstantine informed Pryce that the rebel ship had sustained damaged to its core systems. After Pryce rejected Mon Mothma's demands, she ordered Konstantine to activate the ship's [[tractor beam projector]]. When the surviving rebel [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wings]] piloted by Ezra and [[Gold Leader]] [[Jon Vander]] exited the nebula, Konstantine ordered his gunners to shoot down the rebel fighters. Despite believing the rebel fighters had arrived \"too little, too late,\" Hera outmaneuvered the Imperials by convincing Ezra and Vander to fire their [[proton torpedo]]es into the Archeon Nebula. This caused the nebula's gases to ignite, badly damaging Konstantine and Pryce's Star Destroyers in the inferno. With the tractor beam disabled, the rebel ships fled to [[Dantooine]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n===Battle of Atollon and death===\n{{Quote|Konstantine, return to your assigned coordinates immediately.''\"<br />\"''I've had enough of your games, \"Grand\" Admiral.|Konstantine and [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]]|Zero Hour}}\n[[File:Konstantine_Interdictor.png|thumb|250px|right|Konstantine's interdictor cruiser at Atollon was strategically vital to Thrawn's plan.]]\nSometime after, Konstantine attended a meeting between Thrawn, Grand Moff Tarkin and Governor Pryce, where Thrawn revealed his intention to crush Phoenix Squadron. Shortly after, Thrawn discovered the location of Phoenix Squadron's [[Chopper Base|base]] on [[Atollon]], and he commanded Admiral Konstantine to deploy the Seventh Fleet to the system. Placed in command of [[Konstantine's Interdictor-class Star Destroyer|an]] [[Interdictor vessel]], Konstantine prevented the rebels from escaping the system. When Commander Sato attempted a Danan tactic, Thrawn ordered Konstantine to hold back until ordered otherwise. Dismayed, Konstantine protested and expressed his desire to use overwhelming force instead. Thrawn reminded Konstantine that he had studied the rebels and was familiar with their propensity to use unconventional tactics.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nWhen Commander Sato flew his ''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier ''Phoenix Nest'' towards the center of the Imperial formation, Konstantine attempted to intercept the carrier. Thrawn ordered him to return to his assigned coordinates, but Konstantine, desiring personal glory, expressed his tiredness with Thrawn's \"games.\" Sato's ploy proved to be a trap, as he began a suicide run once his Interdictor was out of position. Realizing his mistake too late, Konstantine frantically ordered evasive action. Not only did Konstantine perish for his reckless insubordination, but his actions undermined the outcome of Thrawn's battle plans by allowing Ezra and Chopper to escape into [[hyperspace]] to seek reinforcements for the rebels. This in turn would allow most of the Rebel personnel stationed on Atollon to escape when they returned with [[Mandalorian]] reinforcements, preventing Thrawn from crushing the rebellion in a single sweep.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Konstantine is more politician than soldier.|Governor Arihnda Pryce|Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow}}\n[[File:AdmiralKassius.png|thumb|right|220px|Admiral Konstantine]]\nAdmiral Konstantine was a stern, by-the-books military leader. He showed little regard for any of his fellow Imperials, and on occasion he showed himself to be self-serving and was not above sacrificing his own men to save himself. When confronted with failure, Konstantine sought to protect his career by shifting blame<ref name=\"Ezra's Duel with Danger\" /> or by misrepresentation of the facts (though this did not fool keen observers like Grand Admiral Thrawn).<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" /> Furthermore, he did not view his colleagues as friends, even Agent Kallus;<ref name=\"Ezra's Duel with Danger\" /> his cold and unsympathetic attitude towards Kallus after a [[Ambush on an Imperial construction module|near-death experience]] on [[Bahryn]] contrasted with the warmth and unlikely friendship that the ISB had been shown his rebel opponent [[Garazeb Orrelios]].<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\">{{Rebels|The Honorable Ones}}</ref>\n\nThe Admiral's tactical skill was not highly regarded by [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]], who saw him as a self-serving [[Politics|politician]] rather than a [[soldier]];<ref name=\"Steps\" /> indeed, he preferred meetings and committees to direct action and left much of his fleet's operation to his subordinates. Despite his role in forging the Imperial Navy's fleet culture, he was known to slavishly follow the [[Imperial Navy Handbook]].<ref name=\"DoR\" /> Underestimating the rebel threat, Konstantine's perception of them was that of a localized insurgency rather than a galaxy-wide insurrection; he lacked Grand Admiral Thrawn's strategic vision for defeating the entire rebellion.<ref name=\"Steps\" /> Instead, he appeared to favor overwhelming military force&mdash;feeling a single ''Arquitens''-class cruiser was insufficient firepower against Iron Squadron's YT-2400 freighter. He also underestimated the ingenuity and resourcefulness of his numerically and militarily-inferior opponents, and panicked when confronted by unexpected enemy forces.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" /> He lacked imagination, expressing disbelief when Grand Admiral Thrawn predicted that the rebel Hera Syndulla would be risky enough to ferry Mon Mothma through the dangerous Archeon pass.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nKonstantine also frequently butted heads with his colleagues and superiors. He expressed his dislike of working with \"mystics\"&mdash;Force-users such as the Inquisitor or Darth Vader&mdash;and was initially skeptical that any Jedi had survived the [[Great Jedi Purge]] at all.<ref name=\"Ezra's Duel with Danger\" /> His working relationship with the [[alien]] Grand Admiral Thrawn was also acrimonious, as his jealousy turned to open insubordination. During the [[Battle of Atollon]], Konstantine defied Grand Admiral Thrawn's orders and tried to intercept the Rebel command ship ''Phoenix Nest'' with his own interdictor cruiser.
