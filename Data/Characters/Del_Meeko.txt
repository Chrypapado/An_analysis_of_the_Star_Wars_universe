You worked your way up through the ranks, first as a stormtrooper, then a shoretrooper, then a TIE pilot. You have received several commendations for courage under fire. Your commanders have made notations that you excel at whatever you turn your hand to, but you seem to be par\u00adticularly gifted with repairing everything&mdash;from armor to droids to engines.|Garrick Versio|Battlefront II: Inferno Squad}}\n'''Del Meeko''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Coruscanti|native]] of [[Coruscant]], the [[capital]] [[Planet|world]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] during the [[Imperial Era]]. During the reign of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], Meeko served in the [[Imperial Military]] as a [[stormtrooper]], a [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretrooper]] with the [[military rank]] of [[sergeant]], an [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot]], and subsequently as the [[chief engineer]] of a [[Star Destroyer]] when holding the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander]]. Following the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance's]] [[Battle of Scarif|theft]] of the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] in the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]], Meeko became an [[agent]] of [[Inferno Squad]], a [[special forces]] [[Squad|unit]] led by [[Captain]] [[Iden Versio]].\n\nThe Emperor's [[death]] in [[4 ABY]] resulted in the activation of [[Operation: Cinder]]; as part of the overall [[Contingency]], its purpose was to ensure the annihilation of both the Empire and its enemies. Inferno Squad was dispatched to [[Fondor]] with orders to retrieve [[satellite]]s that were [[Climate disruption array|critical]] to the execution of Operation: Cinder. After completing their [[Attack on Fondor|mission]], Meeko was ordered to destroy the [[Emperor's Observatory]] on [[Pillio]]. In the course of his [[Mission to Pillio|mission]], he encountered the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. Despite their different allegiances, Meeko and Skywalker worked together by fighting off many [[scritter]]s&mdash;indigenous [[Species|lifeforms]] that were hostile to the offworlders&mdash;in order to reach the [[observatory]].\n\nAfter parting ways with Skywalker, Meeko rejoined Inferno Squad at [[Vardos]] where the team learned that Versio's [[homeworld]] was one of the targets under Operation: Cinder. Unwilling to participate in the ruin of a planet noted for its loyalty to the Empire, Meeko and Versio [[Skirmish on Vardos|rebelled]] against the military in an effort to save civilians. Having severed their ties with the Empire, they surrendered to the Alliance, but were given a chance to fight alongside the Rebels at the [[Battle of Theed]]. By saving [[Naboo]], another planet targeted by Operation: Cinder, Meeko and Versio were both welcomed into the ranks of the newly-formed [[New Republic]] by [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].\n\nIn [[5 ABY]], approximately one year after the [[Battle of Endor]], the [[Inferno Squad (Resistance)|new Inferno Squad]] was among the [[New Republic Defense Force|Republic forces]] that defeated the Imperial forces led by [[Counselor to the Empire|Counselor]] [[Gallius Rax]] at the [[Battle of Jakku]]. In the years that [[New Republic Era|followed]] the Empire's [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|defeat]] and the [[Galactic Concordance|conclusion]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Meeko and Versio raised a daughter named [[Zay Versio]]. [[Standard decade|Decades]] after the war, Meeko was [[Mission to Pillio (First Order)|captured]] by the [[First Order]] and [[Torture|interrogated]] by [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]], a [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] [[Knights of Ren|warrior]] tasked with hunting the last [[Jedi]]. With no further use for Meeko, Ren turned the veteran [[soldier]] over to [[Commander]] [[Gideon Hask]]&mdash;a [[First Order officer]] who once served with Meeko as an agent of Inferno Squad&mdash;who personally executed his former comrade.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nA [[Homeworld|native]] of [[Coruscant]], Del Meeko grew up during the [[time]] of the [[Jedi Order]],<ref name=\"BTS\" /> although the stories he heard about the [[Jedi]] caused him to fear them.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" /> He had two brothers. Meeko worked his way through the ranks of the [[Imperial Military]], starting as a [[stormtrooper]], then as a [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretrooper]] on [[Scarif]]<ref name=\"Inferno Squad\" /> with the [[military rank]] of [[sergeant]],<ref name=\"Note\">{{EncyclopediaCite|Imperial Troops}} states that in order to be a [[coastal defender stormtrooper]] the individual had to hold the rank of sergeant.</ref> as a [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilot]], and finally as a [[chief engineer]] aboard a [[Implacable (Star Destroyer)|Star Destroyer]] with the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander|lieutenant commander]].<ref name=\"Inferno Squad\" />\n\n===Joining Inferno Squad===\nSometime after the [[Battle of Yavin]], Meeko, along with [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Iden Versio]], [[Gideon Hask]] and [[Seyn Marana]], was drafted into [[Inferno Squad]], a [[Imperial Special Forces|Special Forces]] unit in the Imperial Military, by [[Admiral]] [[Garrick Versio]]. Meeko participated in Inferno's first [[Infiltration of the Dreamers|mission]]: to infiltrate and destroy the [[Dreamers]], which was successful, though Marana [[Death|died]].<ref name=\"Inferno Squad\" />\n\nMeeko continued serving as an elite [[agent]] in Inferno Squad, conducting special operations for the Empire throughout the [[Galactic Civil War]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. He fought at the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], which saw the death of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and destruction of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]]. Meeko held the [[Corvus (Raider II-class)|''Corvus'']] during the [[attack on Fondor]], where Inferno fought against a Rebel attack on [[Moff]] [[Raythe]]'s [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] [[Dauntless (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Dauntless'']], which was transporting [[satellite]]s to be used as part of [[Operation: Cinder]].\n\n====Mission to Pillio====\n[[File:Inside_the_Pillio_Observatory.png|thumb|left|250px|Del Meeko and Luke Skywalker inside the Emperor's observatory on Pillio.]]\nMeeko later took part in the [[Mission to Pillio|mission]] to [[Pillio]] as the sole Inferno agent with orders to destroy the [[Emperor's Observatory]]. Despite being on opposite sides of the war and once fearing the Jedi, Meeko agreed to a temporary truce with new age [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] to find the [[Observatory]] while fighting off Pillio's native bugs, ultimately allowing the Jedi to keep [[Jedi star compass|a special compass]] from the facility.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n===Defecting to the Rebel Alliance===\n[[File:Iden_Del_Shriv_and_Leia_on_Naboo.png|thumb|right|250px|Del, Iden and Shriv meeting with Leia Organa.]]\nWhen the [[climate disruption array]]s from the ''Dauntless'' targeted the [[Versio family|Versio]] homeworld of [[Vardos]], Meeko remained loyal to Iden as both went rogue. Hask however insisted that they remain loyal. After being unable to get Hask to join them, they helped a group of civilians and their crew escape aboard the ''Corvus'', narrowly evading the ''[[Eviscerator]]'' and Admiral Versio. They decided to surrender to the Rebel Alliance, and provided key intelligence on Operation: Cinder to [[Danger Leader]] [[Shriv Suurgav]] and [[General]] [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]. Meeko and Iden both fought at the [[Battle of Theed]] in an effort to combat Operation: Cinder, and ultimately defected to the [[New Republic]] as [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] welcomed them in.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n===Serving the New Republic===\n[[File:Iden_and_Del_kiss.png|thumb|left|250px|Del Meeko and Iden Versio kiss following the [[Battle of Jakku]].]]\nMeeko continued to serve in [[Inferno Squad (Resistance)|Inferno Squad]] as it was integrated into the New Republic under the command of Iden Versio, making attempts to capture Hask and Admiral Versio as they fought against the Imperial remnants in the final year of the Galactic Civil War. Meeko piloted the ''Corvus'' at the [[Battle of Jakku]] while Iden shot down Hask and attempted to rescue her father from the crashing ''Eviscerator''. Iden narrowly escaped aboard an [[escape pod]], and reunited with Meeko at the end of the battle, which saw a victory for the Republic and the final defeat of the Empire.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:GideonFO.png|thumb|right|250px|Del Meeko's final moments.]]\nDel and Iden went on to marry and have a daughter, [[Zay Versio]]. Del used the ''Corvus'' to haul cargo in his newfound life of peace, and found faith in [[the Force]]. However, about thirty years after the Battle of Jakku, Del and his crew were captured by [[Protectorate (title)|Protectorate]] [[Gleb]] and [[Jinata Security]] on Pillio, where he was [[Mission to Pillio (First Order)|interrogated]] by [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]] for information on where [[Lor San Tekka]] took the [[map to Skywalker]]. Afterwards, he was confronted by a living Hask, now an [[First Order officer|officer]] in the [[First Order]]. In his final words, he addressed Hask by his first name and implored him not to go after Iden, warning Hask it would not end well for him before being shot four times to death by his former squad mate. Hask then ordered Gleb to bury the corpses of Meeko and his crew in order to leave the ''Corvus'' alone with the intention of luring Iden into a trap.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nShortly afterwards, Iden, Zay and Shriv tracked down Hask to Vardos, where Hask told them about Del's fate. However, Iden, Shriv and Zay managed to [[Skirmish on the Retribution|sneak into]] the ''[[Retribution]]'' and during a struggle to kill Zay, Hask ended up losing his life when a fatally wounded Iden shot him to save her daughter, avenging her husband and demonstrating that Del's last words were right: going after Iden would not end well for Hask.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n[[File:Zay_cries_for_her_mother.png|left|thumb|200x200px|Zay repeated the advice Skywalker had given to her father years prior.]]\nAround [[34 ABY]]<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn Date\">''[[Resistance Reborn]]'' takes place [[Standard day|days]] after the events of [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']], which in turn are set directly after [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]. Since ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of ''The Force Awakens'' to [[34 ABY]], both ''The Last Jedi'' and ''Resistance Reborn'' must also take place around the same [[Standard year|year]], which also includes [[Poe Dameron]]'s speech and [[Zay Versio]]'s response..</ref> and sometime after the [[Battle of Crait]], [[Commander]] [[Poe Dameron]] gave a speech to the [[Resistance]] about how they all had a choice but struggled to explain what that choice was. Zay assured that it was the choice to be better,<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\">''[[Resistance Reborn]]''</ref> the same thing that Luke Skywalker,<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" /> who had recently died on [[Crait]],<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\" /> told her father when they met on Pillio.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Cloud_Cover_PotF.png|thumb|250px|Meeko piloting a TIE fighter]]\nDespite his Imperial background and loyalty to Inferno Squad, Del Meeko was deeply conflicted, and often uncertain about the Empire's methods. Del was horrified after watching Hask kill all the dreamers. He was much more open minded then his squadmates which allowed him to work with Luke on Pillio despite being on opposite sides and believing him to be a terrorist. Growing up on Coruscant, he heard only frightening stories about the Jedi until being saved by Luke Skywalker, who encouraged him to follow his own path. He also liked wildlife and often studied a planets wildlife before visiting.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDel Meeko was created for the [[2017]] video game ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]'',<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" /> where he was portrayed by [[TJ Ramini]].<ref name=\"Ramini Interview\">{{SWYoutube|AcWBEWtjd8U|Battlefront II's T.J.
