Circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"date\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is dated to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' [[Cularin's disappearance|moved]] the campaign forward ten years to the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[The Way of the Force]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]].</ref> the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents, traveled to Tolea Biqua to pick up some [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] [[Power pack|power cells]]. The former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Zelice Sturm]], a local criminal leader, planned to test the agents, so she manipulated the Rancor Riders into attacking them. Griz and a number of other members of the gang subsequently confronted the agents and attempted to steal the power cells, which Sturm had told the gang were experimental [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Energy cell/Legends|energy cells]]. However, the agents defeated Griz and the rest of the Riders.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Way of the Force]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Trandoshans]]"}}}]}}}}
