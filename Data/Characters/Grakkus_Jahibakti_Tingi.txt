He ruled [[Hutta Town]], and like many other Hutt kingpins, controlled an extensive network of [[bounty hunter]]s and [[spice]] [[smuggler]]s. Grakkus was an avid [[collector]] of artifacts of the [[Jedi Order]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Auction of a Padawan===\nAt some point prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]],<ref name=\"Darth Maul II\">[[Darth Maul (2017) 2|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 2]]</ref> Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref> attended an [[Auction of Eldra Kaitis|auction]] hosted by [[Xev Xrexus]] in the [[Drazkel system]], which offered assorted illicit goods to invited buyers.

[[Gender|He]], like many other Hutts, controlled a vast criminal network of various criminals such as [[bounty hunter]]s, smugglers, and [[Thief|thieves]]. As such, Grakkus became extremely wealthy and powerful. Grakkus, unlike most other Hutts, used his influence and fortune to procure antiques, particularly artifacts relating to the [[Jedi Order]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" /> The Empire had [[Great Jedi Purge|purged]] the Jedi from [[the galaxy]] during its [[Proclamation of the New Order|inception]], and destroyed nearly all of the Order's records and artifacts relating to the peacekeeping [[Jedi Knight|Knights]].<ref name=\"Episode III\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Over the [[Standard year|years]], Grakkus came to control [[Hutta Town]], a section of Nar Shaddaa's [[City|unending city]]. Within Hutta Town, [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|Grakkus's palace]] was located, which was where he stored his collection of Jedi artifacts, such as Jedi [[lightsaber]]s, statues, [[holocron]]s, a [[Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor|Delta-7B ''Aethersprite''-class light interceptor]],<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" /> and even the [[bone]]s of several deceased Jedi Knights.<ref name=\"Star Wars 11\">[[Star Wars (2015) 11|''Star Wars'' (2015) 11]]</ref> By the [[time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Grakkus considered his collection to be all that remained of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" /> Also during that time, Grakkus hired the [[Kreel|Gamemaster]], a [[Color|red]]-skinned [[humanoid]], to train the [[gladiator]]s that fought in the Hutt's arena.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref> Unknown to Grakkus, the Gamemaster was actually [[Sergeant]] Kreel of the [[Imperial Military]], who had been dispatched by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to infiltrate Grakkus's palace to look for Jedi prospects so Vader could destroy them; further erasing the Jedi from the [[galaxy]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>\n\nDuring that time, some [[Standard week|weeks]] after the [[Battle of Yavin]],<ref name=\"Vader 7 says a thing\">In [[Darth Vader (2015) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 7]], [[Chelli Lona Aphra]] says \"It's been dead for weeks.\" As [[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]] takes place almost concurrently with [[Darth Vader (2015) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 7]], we can deduce that the cited time span take place several weeks after the [[Battle of Yavin]].</ref> [[Luke Skywalker]], a secret Jedi Padawan, traveled to Nar Shaddaa in order to seek charter to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on the Empire's [[capital]] [[planet]] of [[Coruscant]].

On Grakkus' behalf, the being stole the lightsaber and led Skywalker on a chase into Hutta Town.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" />\n\n[[File:Grakkus_punches_Luke.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Grakkus prepares to knock Skywalker unconscious.]]\nA short time later, the [[agent]] succeeded in his task and he and Skywalker crashed down into Hutta Town, where Grakkus confronted the young [[human]], telling him that he owned Skywalker and his weapon because they were in an area of the moon that Grakkus controlled. Skywalker prepared to fight back against the Hutt, so Grakkus set a pair of his antique [[Holowan Laboratories]] [[IG-100 MagnaGuard]]s that were used by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] during the [[Clone Wars]] two [[Standard decade|decades]] earlier to combat Jedi, to challenge him with their [[electrostaff]]s. The [[battle droid]]s greatly weakened Skywalker, but Skywalker adamantly refused to surrender, so Grakkus knocked him unconscious and dragged him to his collection room.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" />\n\nGrakkus woke Skywalker and told him to open a [[Jedi holocron|holocron]] using [[the Force]] or be [[Death|killed]]. Skywalker was awed by the Hutt's collection, but insisted that he knew not how to activate the holocron because he had never seen one before. Skywalker did manage to awaken the device and at least twenty-three others spread throughout the chamber by concentrating on the Force. [[Jedi Master]]s from [[Millennium|millennia]] passed appeared from the holocrons, offering their knowledge to the individual who had activated them. Grakkus was very pleased with Skywalker's performance&mdash;believing him the last Jedi in the galaxy, and was pleased that Skywalker was under his control.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" />\n\n[[File:Kongo_Grakkus_and_Kreel.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Grakkus introduces the Gamemaster to Kongo the Disemboweler.]]\nGrakkus then turned Skywalker over to the Gamemaster so he could be trained to fight to the death in Grakkus's arena. A short while later, Grakkus checked on Skywalker's improvement with the Gamemaster. The Gamemaster assured the Hutt that the boy would be ready to fight and die in the arena. Grakkus then showed the Gamemaster what Skywalker<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" /> would fight: [[Kongo]] the Disembowler, a massive monster that Grakkus had shipped in on special order from [[Volcano|volcanic]] [[Mustafar]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 11\" /> The Gamemaster was shocked by the beast's size.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" />\n\n===Into the arena===\n{{Quote|The show's over Grakkus. Your arena is officially closed. Oh, and also... You're ''under arrest.''\"''<br>''\"This...this is preposterous!|The Gamemaster and Grakkus|Star Wars (2015) 12}}\nThe fight was set to begin, and the arena was packed full with criminals and [[gambler]]s from all over Nar Shadaa. Some [[scavenger]]s located Skywalker's [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|T-65 X-wing starfighter]], looted it, and brought \"[[The Journals of Ben Kenobi]]\" to Grakkus. Grakkus then told Skywalker he had better fight well in the arena, or be killed slowly in punishment for defying the Hutt. Skywalker continued to rebel, so Grakkus taunted Skywalker with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi's]] journal and forced the \"last of the Jedi\" into the spotlight of the arena to fight Kongo. Grakkus retreated to his prime seat in the stands and watched Skywalker dodge the beast's attacks. The Hutt informed the Gamemaster that he was his favorite [[Slavery|slave]], and that it was a pity that Skywalker could not be the same: the last of the Jedi needed to die. The Gamemaster left Grakkus to watch the fight alone.<ref name=\"Star Wars 11\" />\n\n[[File:Kreel_takes_down_Grakkus.jpg|thumb|280px|Grakkus is knocked to the ground by Kreel, who severed two of his legs with a lightsaber.]]\nShortly thereafter, Kongo's [[shock collar]] was triggered by none other than the Gamemaster, who brandished [[Kreel's lightsaber|a lightsaber]] and destroyed Grakkus's MagnaGuard bodyguards. Grakkus did not understand the betrayal, and was even more confounded when Imperial [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]] poured into the arena and put the Hutt under arrest. The Gamemaster walked Grakkus into the arena and revealed that he had always been an Imperial [[spy]] for the [[501st Legion]], [[Darth]] Vader's personal contingent, known as \"Vader's Fist.\" At [[blaster]]-point, Grakkus activated an emergency [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] blast that rendered anything electronic&mdash;including blasters&mdash;useless. He then attacked the Imperial [[pilot]]s with his bare hands, tossing them around the arena. The crowd began to take bets on whether Grakkus would survive the Gamemaster and Imperials. The electronic pulse blast also deactivated Kongo's shock collar, and the beast was set loose, prompting the crowd to scatter, and allowing Grakkus to regain his composure. In a fury, Grakkus grabbed the Gamemaster around the neck and threatened to feed him to his pet [[lizard]]s. The Gamemaster used a lightsaber to sever two of the Hutt's mechanical legs, knocking the Hutt to the ground, just as a [[legion]] of Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s stormed the arena.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" />\n\n[[File:Grakkus_in_custody.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Grakkus, in the custody of Imperial stormtroopers]]\nSkywalker [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|escaped]] with the help of his friends and Kongo wrecked havoc on Hutta Town, destroying buildings and killing civilians. Grakkus was put in [[stuncuffs]] by the 501st Legion and escorted away from the Smuggler's Moon. Darth Vader arrived and took personal possession of Grakkus's collection in order to erase even more traces of the Jedi from the galaxy. The Gamemaster&mdash;Kreel&mdash;was subsequently promoted by Vader for his efforts in undermining Grakkus.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\" />\n\n===Imprisonment===\n{{Quote|I am a civilized Hutt, attempting to live a civilized life in an uncivilized place.|Grakkus|Poe Dameron 4}}\nGrakkus was incarcerated for the rest of the Galactic Civil War, and most of the subsequent [[New Republic Era|rule]] of the [[New Republic]], in [[Megalox]], a [[prison]] city on [[Megalox Beta]] governed by [[prisoner]]s trapped within its artificial [[gravity]] field. Grakkus established himself as de facto ruler of the city, where he, along with several other similarly [[Cybernetics|cybernetically]] augmented Hutts known as the [[Grakks]], maintained control from a [[Fortress of Grakkus the Hutt|castle-like structure]] that towered over the rest of Megalox. During this time, or possibly before, he encountered and began a \"history\" with [[Terex]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\" />\n\n===Meeting Poe Dameron===\n{{Quote|So tell me, Mr. Dameron&mdash;do we have a deal?|Grakkus|Poe Dameron 4}}\n[[File:Grakks.png|thumb|right|200px|The Grakks apprehend Black Squadron.]]\nApproximately thirty years after the end of the Galactic Civil War, shortly before the start of the [[Cold War]], [[Poe Dameron]] [[Mission to Megalox Beta|visited]] Megalox in his [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|search]] for Lor San Tekka, who had visited Grakkus after leaving [[Ovanis]]. Grakkus and his posse detained Poe and the rest of [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]] in his fortress' compound. He agreed to allow Poe into his residence in return for surrendering their weapons. When Poe asked how Grakkus already knew the reason for his visit, Grakkus revealed that the [[First Order]] [[First Order Security Bureau|Security Bureau]] Agent Terex was already at his dwelling. When Poe objected to Terex's presence, Grakkus countered that he had met Terex a long time ago.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\" />\n\nWhile Grakkus bathed in a moisturizing bath, Poe demanded to know why Terex was here. Grakkus responded that he knew that both men were interested in the explorer Lor San Tekka. Seeking to escape the prison, Grakkus offered to reveal the information to whoever would break him out first. When Terex protested that Grakkus was breaking their deal, the Hutt responded that he had made lots of deals in the past and that he wanted to escape. Terex departed the palace, leaving Poe behind to warn the Hutt that he had complicated the situation.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\" /> Despite Poe's warnings, Grakkus underestimated Terex's vindictiveness. Seeking retribution, Terex hired the rival crime bosses [[Kan Be]], [[Toren|Papa Toren]], and [[Isin]] to muster their gangs for a combined assault on Grakkus' fortress. Terex planned to interrogate Grakkus and then kill him.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 5\" />\n\nWhen the mob arrived, Grakkus thought that the prison riot was a fine cover for an escape attempt. When Poe warned that he could not trust Terex, Grakkus retorted that he did not want a good guy to break him out of prison and expressed his belief that Terex would provide results. Grakkus taunted Poe for not not delivering results. Despite Grakkus' lack of cooperation, Poe and his fellow pilots helped Grakkus' guards fight off the mob.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 5\" /> As the mob advanced into the compound, the Black Squadron pilot [[L'ulo L'ampar]] pleaded for Grakkus to let them in. Grakkus refused to help, claiming that Terex had promised them more and adding that the riot would eliminate the competition. Grakkus was unaware that Terex, Papa Toren, and his [[Ximpi]] were discussing ways to cannibalize the Hutt.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 5\" />\n\nUnknown to Grakkus, Poe had an escape plan which involved getting his [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]] and the other droids to deactivate Megalox's gravity shield, exposing the prison to Megalox Beta's high gravity. This incapacitated Grakkus and the other inmates with the exception of Black Squadron, who donned [[gravity belt]]s. Poe found Grakkus, who accepted his escape plan. After fitting Grakkus with a gravity belt, Poe contacted [[Warden]] [[Luta]] and offered to restore the gravity shield if she would allow them to leave with Grakkus; which she accepted. They then headed to the orbital [[space station]], where Black Squadron's starfighters were parked. Since Grakkus could not fit inside their [[T-70 X-wing starfighter|X-wings]], he took a shuttle. Poe agreed to escort him to safety on the condition that he give the data he owed them once they had departed Megalox Beta.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 6\">[[Poe Dameron 6|''Poe Dameron'' 6]]</ref>\n\nBefore they could leave the system, a vengeful Terex reappeared with his starship ''[[Carrion Spike]]''. Terex used his ship to attack the station, damaging the gravity shield generator and then attacked the station's shuttles. While Grakkus was unconcerned about the plight of others, [[Temmin Wexley]] managed to convince Poe and his fellow pilots to attack ''Carrion Spike'', allowing the prison staff to evacuate their prisoners to safety. Following the dogfight, Grakkus provided all the information on the worlds that Lor San Tekka had visited in return for the squadron running hyperspace calculations for him.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 6\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Grakkus isn't your ordinary Hutt. I mean, just ''look'' at him. He could pull the horns off a reek with his bare hands.|[[Han Solo]]|Star Wars (2015) 35}}\nGrakkus was a male [[Hutt]] who was more physically active than the average Hutt. Aside from his much more muscular frame, he had a set of cybernetic legs to move in a more agile fashion. He also had an interest in collecting Jedi lore and artifacts.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\" /> By [[34 ABY]], Grakkus' skin had become dry and he needed regular moisture baths to keep his skin moist and healthy.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\" />\n\nGrakkus displayed a selfish streak and was solely concerned for his own well-being and safety. He resented his long imprisonment and sought every opportunity to escape. Grakkus had a habit of breaking deals with even friends like Terex at his own whim.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\" /> Despite breaking the deal, Grakkus believed that his old friendship with Terex would last. He underestimated Terex's vindictive and ruthless nature. Grakkus liked Terex because of his criminal streak and despised \"good guys\" like the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 5\" /> After Poe outmaneuvered Terex, Grakkus was savvy enough to accept Black Squadron's offer to help him escape. Grakkus' selfish streak manifested again when he expressed indifference to Terex's attack on the Megalox Beta space station and shuttles. He was willing to have other sentient beings die if he benefited from the situation. Poe exploited Grakkus' selfish nature by withholding access to hyperspace coordinates until he provided the necessary information on Lor San Tekka.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 6\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|Grakkus isn't like other Hutts.
