Nevertheless, the man was first tasked to re-establish communication with the [[One CorSec Plaza|CorSec Headquarters]] in Coronet. The old machinery in the factory was interfering with communications and the CorSec transmitter was not strong enough to pass through. Druno Kener therefore tasked a spacer to reactivate the emergency power generator of the factory and an old antenna relay for the use of CorSec forces.<ref name=\"SWG:RtCA\" /> Upon the communications were restored, Kener focused on shutting down the factory. He ordered a spacer to access the manual override terminals throughout the facility. Once the terminals were activated, Druno Kener was able to directly access the factory's security systems. Unfortunately, the officer was not able to shut down the facility but only disable its backup systems, preventing re-activation of the factory once it would be shut down.<ref name=\"SWG:FaAtFCT\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Find and Activate the Four Control Terminals|Corellia}}</ref> Druno Kener and Lieutenant Varias finally dispatched spacers to access the control override terminal in the depths of the facility. The spacer finally reached the terminal in the command center and effectively shut down the Corellia Droid Factory.<ref name=\"SWG:DtDF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDruno Kener was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:RtCA\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Druno Kener was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Corellia Droid Factory|Corellian Droid Factory]]\" arc with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Game Update 12|Game Update 12]]\", on [[August 10]], [[2009]].<ref>{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/posts/list.m?topic_id=976424|text=Game Update 12: Engineering Trader|archivedate=20090816090206}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=68410&month=082009|text=The Quest Continues|archivedate=20111124005620}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Reactivate the Communication Antenna}}\n*{{SWGWiki|Find and Activate the Four Control Terminals}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kener, Druno}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
