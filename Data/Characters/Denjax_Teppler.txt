You know what I mean?|Denjax Teppler and Han Solo|Legacy of the Force: Exile}}\n'''Denjax Teppler''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] who served in various posts in the [[Corellian system]]'s [[Five Worlds]] government throughout his life. He [[Marriage/Legends|married]] [[Aidel Saxan]], a fellow [[Politics/Legends|politician]], before [[40 ABY]], but the two eventually separated and remained on good terms. In that [[Standard year/Legends|year]], Teppler was the [[Five World Deputy Prime Minister]] and Saxan the [[Five World Prime Minister|Prime Minister]]. She was [[Assassin/Legends|assassinated]] during tensions between [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] and the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]], of which Corellia was a member [[Planet/Legends|world]]; Teppler was afterward thrust into the role of acting Prime Minister. His political opponents immediately plotted and schemed against him, and when he became aware of a secret military meeting that he was not invited to, he recruited the famous Corellian national [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and his wife [[Leia Organa Solo]] to [[Spy/Legends|spy]] on the meeting for him. A [[Battle of Tralus (Second Galactic Civil War)|military operation]] intended to drive an occupying Alliance force off of [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]], one of Corellia's neighboring worlds, was planned at the meeting and was later successfully carried out. The Corellian [[Chief of State (Corellia)|Chief of State]] [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]] seized power in the battle's aftermath and declared himself the [[President of Five Worlds]], a move which ended Teppler's tenure as Prime Minister.\n\nTeppler became Corellia's [[Minister of Justice (Five Worlds)|Minister of Justice]] after Sal-Solo was [[Death/Legends|killed]], but he found himself disenfranchised with the lengths that the Five Worlds government was going to in order to gain ground in its struggle against the [[Galaxy/Legends|Galactic]] Alliance. His fellow politicians began to monitor his activities, and he hired a [[Denjax Teppler's body double|look-alike]] to pose as him and allow him to move around freely. When Teppler met with the Solos in a [[Unidentified Coronet cantina|cantina]] in Corellia's [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]], he obliged their request for classified information by revealing that Five World Prime Minister [[Dur Gejjen]] had ordered an [[Battle of Hapes (Second Galactic Civil War)|assassination attempt]] on [[Queen Mother]] [[Tenel Ka Djo]] of the [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]] in order to have her replaced with pro-Corellian leadership. Agents of the [[Corellian Security Force]] then chased the group out of the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]]. Corellia was soon after joined in its struggle by other renegade Alliance member worlds, and a [[Second Galactic Civil War|full-scale war]] erupted between the Alliance and the newly formed [[Confederation]]. When Alliance agents [[Mission to Vulpter|murdered]] Gejjen, Teppler became the Corellian [[Minister of Information (Five Worlds)|Minister of Information]] and a close [[Aide/Legends|aide]] to Gejjen's replacement, [[Sadras Koyan]].\n\nTeppler and Koyan developed a plan to kill Galactic Alliance [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] by reactivating the disabled Corellian [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] [[Centerpoint Station]] and firing its [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsor]] weapon at his [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|flagship]]. The weapon [[Battle of the rendezvous point|fired]] but failed to hit its intended target, and Teppler's and Koyan's independent actions prompted a furious Confederation to cut Corellia off from all aid. Teppler acted alone and contacted [[Turr Phennir]], the [[Supreme Commander of the Confederation military]], in order to plead his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld's]] case, but he was told by Phennir that the decision would only be overturned if Koyan was removed from power. During a [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Second Galactic Civil War)|subsequent Alliance attack]] on Centerpoint, Teppler again contacted Phennir and told him to place military reinforcements on standby. He then maneuvered Koyan toward an Alliance [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] and his death; the reinforcements arrived, and Corellia was welcomed back into the Confederate fold. The Confederation [[Battle of Uroro Station|surrendered]] to the Alliance [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] [[41 ABY|later]] but remained independent, and Teppler became one of Corellia's co&ndash;Chiefs of State. [[43 ABY|Two years]] after the conclusion of the war, he represented his homeworld at a [[Unification Summit]] held on the Alliance's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Thrust into power===\n{{Quote|With my brother dead, and never having gone through the process of building myself a reliable, loyal society of conspirator-allies, I haven't had anyone I can trust with me since Aidel's death.

Teppler [[Marriage/Legends|married]] fellow [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] politician [[Aidel Saxan]] before<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> 40 ABY,<ref name=\"TERC\" /> but the two separated after some [[Time/Legends|time]]. They remained on friendly terms,<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> and in 40 ABY,<ref name=\"TERC\" /> Saxan was serving as the [[Five World Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] of the [[Corellian system]]'s [[Five Worlds]] government, with Teppler as her [[Five World Deputy Prime Minister|Deputy Prime Minister]]. One of his responsibilities in that role was to dispense information to the Corellian public. Tensions began to rise in that year between Corellia and the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]], [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] centralized government, as Corellia demanded the benefits of Alliance membership but refused to provide them with [[Starship/Legends|starships]] and personnel. The Alliance launched a [[Operation Roundabout|military operation]] against Corellia that saw elements of the [[Galactic Alliance Second Fleet]] deployed in Corellian [[Realspace/Legends|space]]. Several [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Commando/Legends|commando]] teams were dispatched onto the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] surface to kidnap Saxan and [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]], the world's [[Chief of State (Corellia)|Chief of State]], while [[Team Mynock|another team]] boarded [[Centerpoint Station]], an ancient [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] that hung in the Corellian [[Star system/Legends|system]].<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nAlthough the [[Space station/Legends|space station]] was disabled, Saxan and Sal-Solo received advanced knowledge of the strike and avoided capture; the [[Corellian Defense Force/Legends|Corellian Defense Force]] was additionally launched against the Second [[Fleet/Legends|Fleet]] and was able to cause the [[Galaxy/Legends|Galactic]] Alliance a degree of trouble. Alliance [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Matric Klauskin]] ended the skirmish by landing an occupational force on [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]], another planet in the system. With tensions high, Teppler's brother [[Programmer/Legends|programmed]] four [[YVH-Series battle droid|YVH-series battle droids]] to act as security for the Deputy Prime Minister. His brother soon after served as one of Saxan's [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]] when she traveled to [[Toryaz Station]] near the planet [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]] to negotiate a withdrawal from Tralus with Alliance representatives. There, Sal-Solo's [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] [[Attack on Toryaz Station|killed]] them both when the Chief of State acted to eliminate one of his primary political rivals. Teppler was appointed the acting Five World Prime Minister, but he knew that he was without any allies save for his four [[Security droid/Legends|security droids]]<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> and saw himself as largely a puppet ruler.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|231|Teppler, Denjax}}</ref> His political opponents schemed behind his back<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> and stymied him during his first few days of tenure,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> and Teppler feared an impending prolonged conflict with the Galactic Alliance that would devastate Corellia's economy. He was just as wary of Sal-Solo seizing power and expected to quickly be assassinated.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nShortly into his tenure, Teppler received an in-case-of-[[Death/Legends|death]] package from Saxan that detailed dealings she had recently had with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and his wife [[Leia Organa Solo]]. The two were legendary galactic heroes who had strong relations with the Galactic Alliance; Solo was, however, patriotically Corellian, and it had in fact been the two of them who had given Saxan advance warning of the Alliance's attack. Teppler also caught wind of a secret Corellian military meeting where plans would be hatched to oust the Alliance from Tralus, but his political opponents scheduled pressing matters for him at the same time that would prevent him from attending. As such, he sent a coded communication to the Solos and invited them to Corellia, hoping that he could convince them to [[Spy/Legends|spy]] on the meeting for him and confirm his suspicions regarding the loyalties of his fellow politicians. The Solos arrived in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of Corellia, and met with Teppler in his viewing chamber above the meeting room. He informed them of his fears of a war and asked them to view the meeting from his chamber. When Organa Solo suggested that they might report on the meeting to the Alliance, Teppler iterated his belief that peace could not occur until the Alliance left Tralus, and that only an act of war could cause them to leave. The Solos considered his words and agreed to spy on the meeting. Teppler then left to attend to his scheduled duties.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n===Enemies within===\n{{Dialogue|Organa Solo|He's saying that politics is his battlefield, and you're encouraging him to run away from the battle.|Solo|Oh.

The plan was accepted by the military [[Commander/Legends|commanders]] at the meeting, and the [[Battle of Tralus (Second Galactic Civil War)|operation]] was able to drive the Alliance off of Tralus.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> Sal-Solo seized power in the raid's aftermath and created the office of the [[President of Five Worlds]], declaring himself the leader of the entire Corellian system.<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref> The Corellian politician [[Dur Gejjen]] soon after hired the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] to assassinate Sal-Solo,<ref name=\"Bloodlines\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines]]''</ref> and after the President was killed, Gejjen arranged to have himself named both Chief of State of Corellia and the Five World Prime Minister.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> In the wake of Sal-Solo's death, Teppler assumed the role of Corellia's [[Minister of Justice (Five Worlds)|Minister of Justice]] and began to serve under Gejjen<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> in the Five Worlds' new coalition government. Other Corellian politicians began to monitor Teppler's activities, and he accordingly hired a [[Denjax Teppler's body double|look-alike]] that was often mistaken for him and followed home, which allowed Teppler to move about freely.<ref name=\"Exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Exilecropped.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Denjax Teppler passed Corellian secrets to Han and Leia Organa Solo on two occasions during the lead-up to the Second Galactic Civil War.]]\nChafing under a [[Blockade of Corellia|blockade]] imposed by the Alliance on the entire Corellian system and seeking allies, Gejjen arranged for [[Tenel Ka Djo]], the [[Queen Mother]] of the [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]], to be assassinated and for leadership that was sympathetic to the Corellians' plight to take her place. Teppler was not made aware of the plans until the attempt was already underway. The [[Aurra Sing/Legends|assassin]] was [[Battle of Hapes (Second Galactic Civil War)|foiled]], however, and Corellia found its situation worsening. Shortly thereafter, politicians of the coalition and members of the Corellian Defense Force met in an underground bunker in Coronet to discuss the ongoing [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]], and Teppler played the role of peacekeeper during the heated meeting as he attempted to calm down the various shouting participants. When Antilles suggested that they negotiate a no-fault return to the Galactic Alliance, Gejjen relieved him of his position as [[Supreme Commander of the Corellian Defense Force]] and replaced him with Admiral [[Genna Delpin]]. Antilles promptly resigned his commission and refused to aid an organization that he saw as becoming increasingly corrupt. Teppler had similar misgivings with the government, but he felt that the political battlefield was where he could best wage war against it.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nShortly after the meeting, Teppler was contacted by the Solos, who sought another meeting with him. As all of his regular hideouts were being monitored, he arranged to meet them in a [[Unidentified Coronet cantina|Coronet cantina]]. After dodging his surveillance, he donned a cloak and stealthily made his way to the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], where he joined the Solos and their friend [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]]. After Teppler ordered a [[Whiskey/Legends|whiskey]] and [[Water/Legends|water]] from a [[Waiter/Legends|waiter]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]] and introduced himself to Calrissian, the Solos informed him that they had become suspects in the Galactic Alliance's investigation of the assassination attempt on Djo due to their presence on the planet [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]] at the time. Hoping to clear their name, they asked Teppler if he knew who had ordered the hit. Teppler bemoaned what he saw as the diminishing line between [[Treason/Legends|treason]] and loyalty, and a concerned Solo offered to quietly transport him off of Corellia. Teppler declined, citing his desire to keep fighting a political battle, even though he suspected that it would cost him his life. He then informed them that Gejjen had planned the assassination and that Antilles had had no part in it. At that point, Organa Solo, an active [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Force sense/Legends|sensed]] hostile presences outside the cantina through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and learned from a waiter droid that there were storage rooms beneath them. When the front door slammed open and two CorSec agents charged in, Calrissian tipped their table over to provide cover.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nTeppler dove beneath the table and began to fire wildly with his [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]], but only the accurate [[Laser/Legends|laser]] cover provided by Solo and Calrissian kept the agents at bay. When Organa Solo cut out a circle of flooring with her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Teppler dropped into the storage rooms after her. Solo and Calrissian soon followed, and the four of them dashed through the storage rooms toward a metal door that led outside. Solo grabbed Teppler's tumbler of [[Alcohol/Legends|alcohol]] and fired at it so as not to leave any fingerprints, and Teppler caught the door after Organa Solo cut its hinges away. In the alleyway outside, Organa Solo used a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to convince the [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] of a nearby [[garbage loader]] to kill the vehicle's [[Engine/Legends|engines]] and block access to the alley from the nearby street. Teppler declined their offer to escape in a [[Airspeeder/Legends|speeder]] and ran away on foot; he hoped that he would be less conspicuous on his own.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\n===Acting alone===\n{{Quote|General, we don't have time to fence.

We will stand by for confirmation that obstinacy is at an end.|Teppler and Turr Phennir|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nNot long after Teppler's meeting with the Solos and Calrissian, several other planetary governments joined Corellia in its struggle, and the Alliance found itself officially at [[Second Galactic Civil War|war]] with the newly-formed [[Confederation]].<ref name=\"Exile\" /> Gejjen was soon after [[Mission to Vulpter|assassinated]] by members of the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]],<ref name=\"Sacrifice\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]''</ref> and [[Sadras Koyan]], the [[Head of State/Legends|Head of State]] of Tralus, eventually took the reigns as Five World Prime Minister after he was elected by the coalition government's other planetary Heads of State.<ref name=\"Fury\" /> Teppler became one of Koyan's closest [[Aide/Legends|aides]] and was appointed as Corellia's<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> [[Minister of Information (Five Worlds)|Minister of Information]], a post often disparagingly referred to by others as the \"Minister of [[Propaganda/Legends|Propaganda]].\" Without consulting their Confederate allies,<ref name=\"Fury\" /> Teppler and Koyan worked together and developed a plan to kill [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], former Jedi Knight and current Galactic Alliance [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]], by using a reactivated Centerpoint Station to destroy his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]],<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']]. [[Technician/Legends|Technicians]] began working to make Centerpoint operational again, and Koyan contacted the Alliance to invite Jacen to a meeting at a deep-space rendezvous point. He claimed that Corellia was considering a defection from the Confederation back to the Alliance.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nJacen arrived at the rendezvous in his flagship, accompanied by elements of the Second Fleet, and he met a [[Decoy fleet|ragtag Corellian fleet]] of decommissioned and nearly derelict vessels. Meanwhile, Teppler, Koyan, and Delpin traveled to the fire-control chamber of Centerpoint and stood with the technicians who were in the final stages of reactivating the superweapon. When they believed it to be ready, the technicians fired Centerpoint's powerful [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsor]] weapon, which [[Battle of the rendezvous point|vaporized]] the decoy Corellian fleet as well as most of Jacen's fleet, but which failed to destroy the ''Anakin Solo''. The station's systems overloaded in the process, and smoke and flames filled the chamber. Teppler calmed a furious Koyan down, and Delpin reported that they had lost contact with their fleet. Koyan tasked the technicians with repairing the overloaded systems and marched away; Teppler remained behind and thanked the technicians for their efforts before he departed. As Corellia had acted alone in the endeavor, Teppler privately asked Delpin if he could do anything to bear some of the inevitable backlash from [[Turr Phennir]], the [[Supreme Commander of the Confederation military]]. Delpin affirmed that she took her orders from the Five Worlds government and not from the Confederation.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n[[File:CenterpointStation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Centerpoint Station, which Teppler and Sadras Koyan conspired to use to kill Jacen Solo]]\nPhennir responded by cutting Corellia off from all Confederate aid, including medicine, supplies, intelligence, and synchronized fleet movements.<ref name=\"Fury\" /> Teppler went into hiding in Koyan's command bunker on Corellia,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> where he privately contacted Phennir and personally appealed to him to end the embargo. Phennir compared Corellia to an [[Limb/Legends|arm]] infected with [[Poison/Legends|poison]] that the Confederation needed to amputate before the poison spread through the rest of the body, and he told Teppler that Corellia would not be welcomed back into the Confederate fold unless Koyan, the \"poison,\" were removed from power. After the conversation ended, Teppler destroyed the [[bypass card]] he had used to access the [[Holocomm/Legends|holocomm]] unit and considered Phennir's words as he cleaned his fingerprints from the area. Although he did not crave power himself, he concluded that a partnership between him and Delpin could effectively rule Corellia, with her handling military affairs and him civilian. He invited Delpin into the bunker and proposed the idea to her, which she rejected until he lied and told her that it was a worst-case scenario, only to be implemented if Koyan somehow removed himself from office. As she considered the offer, both of their [[Comlink/Legends|comlinks]] chimed, and they were informed that Centerpoint Station, once again operational, was under [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Second Galactic Civil War)|attack]].<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nDelpin rushed to the bunker's situation room, and Teppler raced to the Prime Minister's communications chamber in order to contact Phennir. He told the Supreme Commander to put [[Confederation Fleet|Confederate reinforcements]] on standby and promised that Koyan would cease to be a problem very soon. Phennir obliged, and Teppler contacted Koyan, who was in Centerpoint's fire-control chamber. He told the Prime Minister that enemy forces aboard Centerpoint were moving in to capture him and urged him to evacuate on a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] that was standing by. The shuttle in fact belonged to the Galactic Alliance, but an ignorant Koyan transmitted Centerpoint's firing and command authorization to Teppler and Delpin and made his escape, only to be shot and killed by an [[Chinnith|Alliance officer]]. Teppler joined Delpin in the situation room and watched Phennir's Confederate reinforcements arrive to aid the suffering [[Corellian defense fleet]]. The two of them hoped to win the battle without having to use Centerpoint, but a technician known as [[Rikel (Centerpoint Station)|Vibro]], who harbored a deep hatred of the Galactic Alliance, acted independently and fired the repulsor. Sabotage conducted by a Jedi strike team caused the weapon to target itself, however, and Centerpoint Station was destroyed along with most of the Confederate and Alliance vessels.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nThe war raged for several more [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]], and the Confederation suffered a considerable loss after being trapped by Alliance Admiral [[Nek Bwua'tu]] at the [[Second Battle of Roche]]<ref name=\"Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref> in [[41 ABY]].<ref name=\"TERC\" /> Jacen Solo was soon after [[Battle of Uroro Station|killed]] in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]], and the Alliance joined forces with the [[Imperial Remnant]] and the [[Jedi Coalition]]. The Confederation [[Battle of Uroro Station|surrendered]] to the combined strength of its enemies, and the war was brought to a close.<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> The Confederation remained intact, however. Teppler became one of Corellia's co&ndash;Chiefs of State, and [[43 ABY|two years later]] represented the planet at a [[Unification Summit]] held by the Alliance on the galactic capital of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. The summit aimed to examine the relationship between the Alliance, the Confederation, and the Imperial Remnant, with the ultimate goal of restoring a strong planetary union. During the summit, Teppler's protocol aide [[Enneth Holkin]] was attacked by [[Valin Horn]], a Jedi Knight suffering from a mysterious [[Force psychosis|psychosis]].<ref name=\"Outcast\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I've underestimated you, Prime Minister.

Teppler was diplomatic and made a point to thank the technicians who worked to restore Centerpoint Station for their efforts after Sadras Koyan, his superior, made a hasty exit from the station's fire control room. Teppler knew that Admiral Genna Delpin would receive blame when the Confederation discovered that the station was operational and hoped to absorb some of it himself in order to lessen her burden.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nTeppler did not crave power. In the years leading up to<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> 40 ABY,<ref name=\"TERC\" /> he neglected to build a network of political allies and conspirators, and he thus found himself without any political clout or any trustworthy comrades after being thrust into the role of Five World Prime Minister. He knew that his tenure was temporary, and his primary goals while in office were to prevent Corellia from being ruined by war and from being ruled by Thrackan Sal-Solo, whose leadership of the Five Worlds Teppler believed would be a \"wrong\" regime.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> After Turr Phennir suggested that he remove Sadras Koyan from power, Teppler aspired to replace the Five World Prime Minister, but it was not due to hunger for power or a belief that the war could be won under his leadership. He approached the idea practically and hoped to split the responsibilities with Delpin, which would allow her to lead the Corellian Defense Force and him to handle the planet's civilian chiefs.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nFor various reasons, Teppler committed several acts of treason against other members of Corellia's government during the Second Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /><ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Exile\" /> During his tenure as Five World Prime Minister, he clandestinely invited Han and Leia Organa Solo, allies of the Galactic Alliance, to spy on a meeting of Corellia's top military commanders so that they could inform him where the loyalties of his fellow politicians lay. His ultimate goal was peace, and he believed that forcibly ousting the Alliance from Tralus was the only way to achieve it. Teppler took a calculated risk that the Solos felt the same way and that they would not report the meeting's agenda to the Alliance.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> When a dispute between Koyan and Phennir led to Corellia being cut off from Confederate aid, Teppler took it upon himself to privately contact Phennir and plead his homeworld's case. Phennir told him that removing Koyan from power would bring Corellia into the Confederate fold, and during the Alliance's subsequent attack on Centerpoint Station, Teppler did what needed to be done in order to protect his homeworld by maneuvering Koyan toward an Alliance shuttle and his death. These actions prompted Phennir to provide Corellia with [[Navy/Legends|naval]] reinforcements.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nAnother meeting with the Solos, this time in a cantina in Coronet [[City/Legends|City]], led to an additional act of treason on Teppler's part. During Dur Gejjen's tenure as Five World Prime Minister, Teppler saw very blurred lines between treason and loyalty and between selfishness and altruism. He accordingly told the Solos that it had been Gejjen who had ordered Tenel Ka Djo to be assassinated;<ref name=\"Exile\" /> the Galactic Alliance later had Gejjen himself killed.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> While serving under Gejjen, Teppler fully believed that he would be murdered by his political opponents, but when he was offered transportation off his homeworld, he insisted that he remain on Corellia and fight against a corrupt regime on the political battlefield.<ref name=\"Exile\" /> Although he valued his life over power, Teppler's ultimate loyalty lay to Corellia,<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> and he refused to abandon his homeworld in order to protect his life.<ref name=\"Exile\" /> Teppler was loyal to Corellia over the Confederation<ref name=\"Fury\" /> and conspired with Koyan to secretly reactivate Centerpoint Station;<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> he believed that their defiance would be justified if it resulted in the death of Galactic Alliance Chief of State Jacen Solo.
