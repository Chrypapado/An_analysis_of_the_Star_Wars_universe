You didn't take risks?|Finn Galfridian, to his father|Invasion 1}}\n'''Caled Galfridian''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Artorias]] during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]] in [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]]. He was the [[King/Legends|King]] of Artorias and lived with his [[Queen/Legends|queen]], [[Nina Galfridian|Nina]], and two children, [[Finn Galfridian|Finn]] and [[Kaye Galfridian|Kaye]]. Caled was a veteran of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], notably fighting in the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]] with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. He also fought in the [[Battle of Artorias|defense]] of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] when the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invaded, although the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] was ultimately lost. Despite losing his wife and daughter to the clutches of the invaders, Caled organized a [[Artorias resistance|guerrilla resistance movement]] to delay the Yuuzhan Vong and find his family. His son Finn would escape the planet and join the [[New Jedi Order]] under the tutelage of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Battle of Artorias===\n{{Quote|What was that?''\"<br />\"''It's a sound I haven't heard since&hellip;quickly inside.|Caled and his son, during the invasion of Artorias|Invasion 1}}\nPrior to the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Battle of Artorias|invasion]] of [[Artorias]] in [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]], Caled ruled an idyllic [[Planet/Legends|planet]] that did not even possess a rudimentary defense force. On the day of the attack, Caled was scolding his son [[Finn Galfridian|Finn]] for taking reckless risks. As the two argued, the sound of a large explosion interrupted the two, causing Caled to immediately run to the weapons locker and grab [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blasters]].<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\nThe king and his son rushed toward the marketplace to rescue Caled's wife [[Nina Galfridian|Nina]] and daughter [[Kaye Galfridian|Kaye]], but were unable to make it due to the surrounding chaos. Caled ordered his people to retreat to the [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyards]] and covered their retreat. The two [[Galfridian family|Galfridians]] sealed the [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] doors, but the building was besieged by many of the Yuuzhan Vong. To make matters worse, the king was informed by his friend [[Dulac]] that all the [[Starship/Legends|ships]] had been sabotaged by a [[Unidentified Artorias Yuuzhan Vong agent|Yuuzhan Vong agent]]. He ordered Finn and his [[Droid/Legends|droid]], [[Prowl]], to fix the sabotaged ships while he and the rest of defenders prepared for the assault. The siege came to naught as the Artorians were saved by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], who cut down the Yuuzhan Vong [[Warrior caste|warriors]].<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\nCaled greeted his old comrade-in-arms, who told the king that the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] had sent [[C-3 passenger liner|ships]] to evacuate the populace. Caled personally refused to evacuate, citing his responsibility as king to defend Artorias, as well as finding some sign of his wife and daughter. Although Finn demanded to accompany his father, Caled told him that in light of his own [[Death/Legends|death]], the Artorians still needed a king. Caled quickly assembled a [[Artorias resistance|strike team]] to attack the Yuuzhan Vong invaders at the nearby beach. The last time the strike team was seen, they were engaging the Yuuzhan Vong in the surf.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\nIn the meantime, Finn was recruited by Skywalker for [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] training at the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] after demonstrating his [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force ability]] when he [[Force sense/Legends|sensed]] his mother and sister in danger. Nina and Kaye had been overwhelmed by the Yuuzhan Vong warriors in the marketplace, and although Kaye was able to kill one of the warriors, the two Galfridians were herded into a Yuuzhan Vong [[slaveship]] and imprisoned.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\n===Leading the Resistance===\nCaled led the resistance from a base hidden deep underwater, striking against the Yuuzhan Vong's [[Terraforming/Legends|Vongforming]] of Artorias. During their missions they killed many sentries, which needed to be replaced. The reinforcement were taken from the slaveship [[Heart of Artorias|''Tsam P'ah'']], which imprisoned many of Artorias' inhabitants. The smaller number of guards aboard the slaveship allowed the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] to [[Revolt aboard the Tsam P'ah|revolt]]. At the same time Caled led a mission to rescue his friend Dulac. They succeeded, and brought Dulac to their base.\n\n[[File:Inv08-CaledPoisoned.jpg|right|thumb|Finn holds his wounded father.]]\nOn [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] Finn had learned through a [[Dray's holocron|holocron]] that Dulac actually was a Yuuzhan Vong wearing an [[Cloaker|ooglith masquer]]. He raced back to Artorias with [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] to warn his father. He was too late, however, as Dulac had already revealed himself to Caled and attacked him. Caled, despite his surprise, managed to hold his own in the fight, but Dulac slowly gained the upper hand. The timely arrival of Prowl, who shot Dulac on Finn's command was the end of the struggle between the two men. Dulac, realizing he was about to die, had one final trick up his sleeve: a [[plaeryin bol]]. Dulac launched the venom at the King, hitting him full in the face. Dulac was quickly dispatched by Jacen and Jaina, but Caled was already heavily wounded.\n\n===A Father's Goodbye===\n{{Quote|You came. I'm just grateful I was able to see you. I was able to the good man you're becoming. I was able to glimpse of what you'll be....|Caled Galfridian, to Finn shortly before his death|Invasion: Rescues 5}}\nAfter attempts by Jacen and Jaina to [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] him failed Finn went to see see his father one last time. Caled was very happy to see his son as a Jedi apprentice and asked to see Finn's lightsaber. Caled admired the weapon and told his son that he knew there was anger in him and told him not to strike out with it. He proceeded to tell Finn the story about how he met Nina. It was shortly after his first wife, the mother of Finn and Kaye, had died and he and a group of soldiers went to remove a slaver named [[Dowron]] from the planet. Dowron had Nina as a slave and after Caled freed her she killed Dowron with her bare hands. He then admitted that at the time he was angry about the loss of his first wife and was looking only to fight the bad of Artorias instead of fostering the good in it, and that only Nina's unconditional love for him and his children quieted his anger.\n\nHe then confided in Finn that he and Nina always knew that Kaye would be a leader but that they did not know what Finn would do, but Nina would be proud that he was becoming a Jedi and that he himself was proud of his son. Caled then tried to convince Finn to leave Artorias because the attacks of the [[Artorias resistance|Resistance]] were futile. Finn disagreed and responded by telling him about how the Yuuzhan Vong's lack of [[The Force/Legends|Force]] signature led to the death [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Lar Le'Ung]] during the Evacuation of [[Rychel]] and that he could in fact sense the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Inv9\">[[Invasion: Rescues 4|''Invasion: Rescues'' 4]]</ref> Finn believed he was a freak because of this ability but his father assured him that he was not, and thought that maybe it was a gift. Finn then apologized for not getting there soon enough but Caled responded by saying that he was grateful to see the man he would one day be. Caled reaffirmed his belief that Finn needed to take his people off world and when Finn tried to respond about it being there planet Caled simply kissed his forehead and told his son that some things were more important than a planet. Caled then told Finn to leave so he could make a recording to Nina with Prowl. In the recording Caled to Nina how he always knew there was a secret that she kept but he knew he tell her children someday. After Caled finished the recording Finn returned and placed his hand on his father. The King of Artorias was now dead.<ref name=\"Inv10\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|No. I need to find my family&hellip;and I won't abandon Artorias to these creatures.

You have people to save, including my son.|Caled to Luke Skywalker, during the Invasion of Artorias|Invasion 1}}\n[[File:Caledscold.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Caled, scolding his son Finn]]\nCaled Galfridian took his responsibilities as king and father seriously; he was very protective of his family and his people and ready to put himself in harm's way to ensure the safety of both. His authority was evident when he personally ordered the Artorians in the marketplace to retreat to the hangar, as well as when he put himself on the front line in defense of the building. Even when he was offered the opportunity to escape, Caled demonstrated his responsibility as king, remaining behind to organize a resistance movement.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nCaled's experiences in the Galactic Civil War gave him experience in combat as well as making him a military leader. He was skilled in the use of [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonators]] and in commanding a small [[Army/Legends|army]], using the latter to great effect when he led a strike force against the Yuuzhan Vong on Artorias.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCaled Galfridian was created by [[Tom Taylor]] and illustrated by [[Colin Wilson (artist)|Colin Wilson]] for the ''[[Star Wars: Invasion]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series.<ref name=\"Inv\">''[[Star Wars: Invasion]]''</ref> The series features the Galfridian family as they become separated during the Yuuzhan Vong War.<ref name=\"Inv1\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Invasion 1|''Invasion'' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Invasion 3|''Invasion'' 3]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Invasion 4|''Invasion'' 4]]\n*[[Invasion 5|''Invasion'' 5]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Invasion: Rescues]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|117|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*{{InsiderCite|124|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.eucantina.net/interview-with-randy-stradley Interview with Randy Stradley]\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Caled Galfridian\n|pt=Caled Galfridian\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0444\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Galfridian, Caled}}\n[[Category:Alliance Military members]]\n[[Category:Artorias residents]]\n[[Category:Galfridian family]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
