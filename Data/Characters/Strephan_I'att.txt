With a length of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] service under his belt, that was precisely whom he sold his weapons to.\n\n==Biography==\nThe most significant creation of his was an [[anti-energy field]] prototype co-developed with the [[Daye Azur-Jamin|lover]] of his granddaughter [[Tinian I'att Azur-Jamin|Tinian]].\n\nI'att was planning to retire to [[Geridard]] with his wife when the successful presentation of the invention prompted [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Eisen Kerioth|Kerioth]] to order the family to [[Doldur]] where he could directly oversee the manufacture of the technology with the intent on personally passing it on to [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] as his own. When Strephan refused, he was executed alongside his wife by the Moff's [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] escort.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|4|Tinian on Trial}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=Tinian on Trial}}\n*{{Journal|6|To Fight Another Day}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|10|Only Droids Serve the Maker}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Strephan I'att\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I'att, Strephan}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Druckenwell residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
