We hunters know more than everybody.|Gurke to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\n'''Gurke''' was a [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] living in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the time of the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He often spent time in search of [[Krayt dragon/Legends|Krayt dragons]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]]. When it became apparent that it was too hard of game to kill, He then led a band of [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] [[Hunting/Legends|hunters]], including [[Narkal]] and [[Ugzak]], who robbed and killed those they found in the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]]. During one of his forays he threatened to kill [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], but was persuaded to leave him alone. Gurke thought of Narkal as stupid, and frequently told him to shut up.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDepending on the player's inclination, Gurke and his band can be dealt with peacefully, bribed, or killed.\n\nWhen the player encounters Gurke in the hunting lodge, they have the option of using the Force to silence him, insulting him until he leaves, or complimenting him. The insult option, in which Revan tells the trio to \u201chold your tongues or I'll rip them out,\u201d will gain Dark Side points.\n\nNone of these options will prevent the ambush at the speeder accident\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gurke\n|fi=Gurke\n|pl=Gurke\n|ru=\u0413\u0443\u0440\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
