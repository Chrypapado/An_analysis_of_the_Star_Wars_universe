But the moment she placed her political goals\u2014however noble\u2014above the principles of the people and state she governed, she ceased to possess the right to govern. As of today, the Senate has accepted Kayl's resignation. Further action will be left to the discretion of the [[Supreme Court/Legends|courts]]. I am proud to serve a citizen like you.|Chancellor Janarus|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Vanara Kayl''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] who represented the people of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] with the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|resurgent Sith Empire]]. She was also in charge of Coruscant's government and led the reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the [[Sacking of Coruscant]]. Senator Kayl's actions resulted in many deaths and enslavements in the Old Galactic Market District.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] politician, Vanara Kayl served in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] around [[3643 BBY]] following the [[Great Galactic War]] and the resurgence of the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]]. Part of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]-era Senate, Kayl represented the interests of the people of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], becoming well-respected and seen as very favorable by her constituents.<ref name=\"SWTORCiGC\" /> She led the Coruscant government and was placed in charge of Coruscant's reconstruction efforts.<ref name=\"Codex\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics}}\nHowever, Kayl had used funds from the [[Migrant Merchants' Guild]] in order to win the election in exchange for her promise for housing projects for the refugees whose interests the Guild supposedly represented. The Guild attempted to blackmail Kayl as well as attack the skylane network around the [[Senate Building]]. Kayl responded by sending a contingent of [[Police officer/Legends|police officers]] with the [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|Coruscant Security Force]] under the command of CSF [[Chief of Security/Legends|Chief of Security]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Winborn]]. With the assistance of an individual, the CSF were able to prevent the attack. However a recording of Kayl arguing with a leader of the Guild was found. The individual who assisted the CSF confronted her and after some debate called a session of the Senate to disclose her actions. After the session, Kayl resigned from her position.<ref name=\"SWTORCiGC\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVanara Kayl appears in the ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' Coruscant quest called \"Crisis in Galactic City\". The player can also choose to destroy the recording.
