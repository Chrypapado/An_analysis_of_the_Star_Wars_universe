Uh, sorry about that misunderstanding...|Nevis Kitt|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Nevis Kitt''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] living during the [[Galactic War]]. A [[Captain/Legends|captain]] in the [[Corellian Security Force]], he responded to the Imperial invasion on his homeworld by rallying forces and organizing a resistance. During the erupting [[Battle of Corellia]] Nevis was fooled by an undercover [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]] agent [[Darmas Pollaran]] to blow a wall in the strategically important [[Supply Tuner 26]] that led from the [[Blastfield Shipyards]] into the [[Red Light Sector (Corellia)|Red Light Sector]]. Nevis Kitt and other resistance fighters have gathered in the tunnel and were listen to Pollaran's speech in preparation for detonating the charges when a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] known as [[Voidhound]] interrupted the gathering. Pollaran tried to frame the newcomer as the agent of the [[Harridax Kirill|Voidwolf]], but was revealed as an Imperial himself instead and send [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] against the resistance while escaping in confusion. When the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] forces led by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Sumalee]] arrived and dispatched the [[Droid/Legends|droids]], Nevis Kitt identified them as coming from [[Councillor/Legends|Councilor]] [[Caicos]]'s droid factory, now serving as a makeshift medical center. The resistance had an undercover [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Shi Bata]] stationed there and Nevis Kitt contacted him to expect the Voidhound and arrange him the way inside.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kitt, Nevis}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
