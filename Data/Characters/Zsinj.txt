Though he bore no first name per the traditions of his [[Zsinj's father|father]], a [[Fondorian]] [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyard]] [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]], Zsinj preferred to follow in the footsteps of his more famous [[Parent/Legends|mother]], Mme. [[Maarisa Zsinj]], a [[Chandrilan/Legends|Chandrilan]] [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] in the [[Republic Outland Regions Security Force]] popularly known as the \"Ace of the Spacelanes.\" Zsinj served under his mother until the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].\n\nAfter the [[Declaration of a New Order|birth]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Maarisa Zsinj refused the order to return her [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Retaliation]]'', to port for decommissioning. The elder Zsinj denounced the new government as corrupt and went rogue, preying on ships of the Empire as a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]]. Young Zsinj was granted [[Commanding officer/Legends|command]] of the aging [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Iron Fist (Victory-class)|''Iron Fist'']] to hunt down his own mother. The campaign was intense but ultimately successful, and Maarisa Zsinj was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by her own son. The younger Zsinj was officially named the first [[Warlord of the Empire]], and the elder Zsinj was expunged from Imperial history. This was the beginning of a string of victories that would lead to ever greater power for Zsinj, but also initiated a pattern of absurd thinking that would confound future opponents and analysts.\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Zsinj was promoted to admiral and given command of the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] [[Iron Fist (Executor-class)|''Brawl'']]&mdash;which Zsinj later renamed ''Iron Fist'' after his first command&mdash;by [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] himself. Zsinj quarantined the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]] and prevented the escape of the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]], and Palpatine was personally grateful to Zsinj for halting this potential threat to his rule. Soon after this, Zsinj became [[High Admiral]] of the [[Crimson Command]], a [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] of ''Victory''-class [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]], and gained the position of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] over the [[Quelii Oversector]], a large portion of the northern quadrant of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. It was from this position that Zsinj established himself as an independent [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].\n\nAfter what was believed by the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] at large to be the death of Palpatine, Zsinj was recognized by many as the most powerful of the post-Imperial warlords. In fact, his official title of \"Warlord of the Empire\" popularized the term \"warlord\" for the renegades who broke away from the crumbling Empire, as in the initial chaos following the Battle of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] he proclaimed loyalty to the Empire and used his legal title to foster an appearance of legitimacy. However, he set up a base on [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno]], locked down his [[Oversector/Legends|Oversector]], and began to absorb the forces and territories of his rivals like [[Terrinald Screed/Legends|Terrinald Screed]] and [[Nigel Nivers]]. Along with his formidable [[Navy/Legends|fleet]], Zsinj built a supporting financial infrastructure unlike that of any other warlord, and at the height of his power he [[Zsinj's Empire|controlled]] a third of the known galaxy, rivaling both the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] and the Galactic Empire.\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]], Zsinj became the target of a New Republic [[Hunt for Zsinj|campaign]] against him, which was led by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who became a personal enemy of Zsinj. Zsinj's forces fought Solo's task force on several occasions, each taking turns laying traps for the other. In [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], ''Iron Fist'', Zsinj's personal [[Command ship/Legends|command ship]], narrowly escaped destruction at the hands of [[Solo Fleet|Solo's fleet]] twice, the first [[Time/Legends|time]] due to New Republic collaboration with Imperial Admiral [[Teren Rogriss]] while the [[Battle of Selaggis|second engagement]] was precipitated by a double agent aboard the ''Iron Fist'', [[Gara Petothel]]. Zsinj faked the destruction of the ''Iron Fist'' and escaped to his [[Rancor Base|hidden base]] over Dathomir to plan his next move. However, his outpost was [[Battle of Dathomir (Hunt for Zsinj)|attacked]] by the [[Hapan]] [[Hapan Royal Navy|war fleet]]. During the battle, Solo, who had won Dathomir in a [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] match and had journeyed to the world, flew his personal craft, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], on a strafing run against the ''Iron Fist''. Firing [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missiles]] at the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of Zsinj's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], Solo slew the warlord and brought about the collapse of his empire. Zsinj's former forces scattered to join other warlords or strike out on their own, but no other independent force ever matched Zsinj's power.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rise to prominence===\n{{Quote|Mama.|Zsinj's first and last word|The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire}}\nZsinj&mdash;he had no first name, in the ancient tradition<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> of his [[Zsinj's father|father's]]<ref name=\"blogpart1\">{{SW|url=news/the-imperial-warlords-despoilers-of-an-empire-part-1|int=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire|text=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire, Part 1}}</ref> [[Fondorian]] caste<ref name=\"Atlas\" />&mdash;was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]]<ref name=\"NEGC\" /> prior to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> that ravaged [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] from [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]] to [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]].<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> Zsinj was the son of a [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyard]] [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]],<ref name=\"EGW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref> who passed on some of his technical aptitude to his [[Youngling/Legends|youngling]],<ref name=\"CTD\">''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''</ref> but young Zsinj chose to follow in the footsteps of his more famous [[Parent/Legends|mother]], Mme. [[Maarisa Zsinj]]. A [[Chandrilan/Legends|native]] of [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] and an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] in the [[Republic Outland Regions Security Force]] in the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], the elder Zsinj was popularly known as the \"Ace of the Spacelanes,\" and she inspired her young son to join the [[Imperial Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] at [[Prefsbelt IV/Legends|Prefsbelt IV]]<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> upon reaching the minimum enrollment age.<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\n[[File:Prefsbelt_Academy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Naval Academy at Prefsbelt IV, at which Zsinj enrolled at the minimum age]]\nThe younger Zsinj did not really stand out among his classmates<ref name=\"CTD\" />&mdash;in fact his [[Instructor/Legends|instructors]] and classmates at the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|academy]] considered him quite dull<ref name=\"EGW\" />&mdash;however he showed amazing technological insight and a great deal of promise as a tactician. His instructors tried to persuade him to consider a career in support services, but Zsinj insisted that he was \"destined to become a great warrior,\" and he graduated in the top third of his class.<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\nAfter serving competently under his mother during the Clone Wars, the wave of [[Non-huMan|chauvinism]] brought on by the [[Declaration of a New Order|founding]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> in 19 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|BBY]]<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> propelled the young Zsinj up the [[Military rank/Legends|ranks]] while his elder mother was relegated to less important duties. When Mme. Zsinj's [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]], ''[[Retaliation]]'', was scheduled for decommissioning, her son volunteered to take [[Commanding officer/Legends|command]] to bring the [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] back to port. This was not to be, however, as Mme. Zsinj refused her orders and instead publicly denounced the Empire as corrupt. Turning to [[Pirate/Legends|piracy]], the \"Ace of the Spacelanes\" was now an enemy of the Empire, and to hunt her down the Empire turned to the one who knew her best: her own son.<ref name=\"blogpart1\" />\n\nZsinj was granted command of the [[Victory I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory I''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Iron Fist (Victory-class)|''Iron Fist'']],<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> which was one of the oldest ships of its class<ref name=\"CTD\" /> and was itself due for retirement, to hunt down and destroy the ''Retaliation'' and Mme. Maarisa Zsinj. Putting aside his feelings, young Zsinj waged a ferocious and ultimately successful campaign, [[Death/Legends|killing]] his own mother. The elder Zsinj was retroactively stripped of her rank and expunged from Imperial records, and the younger Zsinj was granted the first official title of [[Warlord of the Empire]].<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> By [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Zsinj's early life had been so thoroughly obfuscated as to prevent even the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]] from compiling any significant details prior to his [[Imperial Military/Legends|military]] career.<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\n[[File:VSD_egvv.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plan view of the ''Victory''-class Star Destroyer, an example of which was given to Zsinj to command]]\nZsinj's campaign against his mother marked the beginning of his pattern of absurdist thinking and a reported disdain for everything that hailed from his mother's [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of Chandrila.<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> He also began a pattern of innovation, and of efficient use of resources. During his early career, he developed a tactic of retreating inside an [[Asteroid belt|asteroid field]] when faced with a superior [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] force, waiting for the pursuers to move in using the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroids]] as cover, and then blowing up the asteroids to smaller pieces with [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolaser]] blasts, with the resulting debris clouds being extremely effective in destroying, damaging and/or forcing the attackers to abort their attack.<ref name=\"CTD\" /> This tactic was later adapted into a training simulation by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"XWWS\">''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]''</ref> It was also during this [[Time/Legends|time]] that Zsinj would meet his future right-hand man, [[Melvar]].<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]],<ref name=\"NEGC\" /> which later marked the [[0 BBY/Legends|zero point]] in the New Republic's calibration of the galactic calendar,<ref name=\"NEC\" /> the ''Iron Fist'' was assigned to patrol the area in the [[Quelii sector]] around the planet [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]].<ref name=\"NEGC\" /> Dathomir was a backwater world, where the Imperial [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]] was still equipped with broken-down [[HAVw A5 Juggernaut|A5 Juggernauts]] and even basic supply shipments were irregular,<ref name=\"NEGVV\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels]]''</ref> but the Empire built a [[Dathomir Imperial Prison|prison complex]] on the planet for [[Politics/Legends|political]] dissidents and intellectuals.<ref name=\"NEGC\" /> [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] eventually realized that the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Dathomirian/Legends|Dathomiri]] [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]] were too much of a threat to be allowed off-planet. To eliminate this threat, Zsinj attacked the [[Prison/Legends|prison]] from [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]], destroying every [[Realspace/Legends|spaceworthy]] craft. Although this stranded all the Imperial personnel on the planet along with the Nightsisters, Palpatine applauded Zsinj's actions, promoted Zsinj to admiral, and gave him command of the newest [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]], [[Iron Fist (Executor-class)|''Brawl'']].<ref name=\"NEGC\" /> The ''Victory''-class [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] was sent to the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] under [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]].<ref name=\"DFRSB\">''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nWith the ''Brawl'' at his command, Zsinj became the heart of Imperial authority in what was now the [[Quelii Oversector]],<ref name=\"CTD\" /> with the ranks of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]]<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> and [[High Admiral]] of [[Crimson Command]]<ref name=\"EGW\" />&mdash;a [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] of a hundred refitted ''Victory''-class Star Destroyers plated with [[Color/Legends|red]] [[Havod/Legends|havod]] alloy [[Hull/Legends|hulls]].<ref name=\"blogpart2\">{{SW|url=news/the-imperial-warlords-despoilers-of-an-empire-part-2|text=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire, Part 2|int=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire}}</ref> In this lofty new position, one of Zsinj's duties was to conquer the [[Drackmarian]]s and control the Rimward stretch of the [[Hydian Way/Legends|Hydian Way]] [[Super-hyperroute/Legends|super-hyperroute]]. To that end, the Quelii [[Sector Fleet]] was the single largest in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]].<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Even as he gained power and prestige, Zsinj maintained a public persona that belied his genius. With his portly figure and piratical [[Hair/Legends|moustache]], he put his enemies off guard before destroying them.<ref name=\"blogpart1\" />\n\n===From admiral to warlord===\n{{Quote|He is a survivor, and shows cunning at playing his enemies off against each other.|Leia Organa|X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble}}\n[[File:Zsinj-CTD.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Zsinj could be an imposing figure when he wished.]]\nAfter the Imperial defeat at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> the Empire began to fracture and core elements of Imperial power were brought under the control of the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Ruling Council]]. Zsinj broke away from the Empire with the forces under his command, renaming the [[Star Dreadnought/Legends|Star Dreadnought]] ''Brawl'' to ''Iron Fist'' in honor of his first command and making it the centerpiece of his military forces,<ref name=\"CTD\" /> setting up headquarters on the planet [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno]], and ruthlessly dealing with any [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] threat within his holdings. However, Zsinj's breakout from central authority was not entirely evident, and the Ruling Council's [[Advisor/Legends|advisers]] could find no fault with his tactics at first<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> because he loudly proclaimed loyalty to the true Empire, having learned a hard lesson from the downfall of his mother.<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> Instead of trying to seize more power and territory by force, Zsinj worked to solidify his power base.<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\nZsinj sent emissaries to the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] and later the fledgling New Republic, causing them to initially leave him alone as they focused on nibbling at the Imperial forces based on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]],<ref name=\"CTD\" /> though [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] forces did harass his borders somewhat in 4 ABY before shifting to a more defensive posture. During this time, a growing rivalry began to develop between Zsinj and warlord [[Treuten Teradoc]], whose own pocket Empire, the [[Greater Maldrood]], bordered Zsinj's territory to the south.<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> Throughout the following years, the two engaged in a series of border skirmishes&mdash;of all his fellow warlords, Teradoc was the one for whom Zsinj had the greatest antipathy.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Beyond those conflicts, however, Zsinj coexisted peacefully with the [[Ciutric Hegemony]] and the loyalist Empire,<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> and had only occasional minor conflicts with Grand [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Ardus Kaine]]'s [[Pentastar Alignment]].<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\nIn the earliest [[Standard day/Legends|days]] after the death of the Emperor, many warlords found it difficult to maintain the respect of their subjects. With most true [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] remaining loyal to the Imperial Ruling Council, some warlords chose to equip regular [[Infantry/Legends|infantry]] with [[Stormtrooper armor/Legends|stormtrooper armor]]. Zsinj took a different route, choosing instead to form his own elite military force. Assembled and led by [[General/Legends|General]] Melvar, the [[Raptors]] combined aspects of the stormtroopers and the [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guard]], and they were loyal only to Zsinj. Zsinj's industrial complex created or purchased unique equipment for the Raptors, like [[Incom Corporation/Legends|Incom]] [[Y-4 Transport|Y-4 \"''Raptor''\" transports]] and [[TIE/rpt starfighter|TIE Raptors]]. Known for both covert<ref name=\"CSWERaptors\">{{CSWECite|III|374|Zsinj's Raptors}}</ref> and public actions, the Raptors defended Zsinj's holdings, protected his allies, and terrified his enemies.<ref name=\"CTD\" /> Zsinj made overtures, both friendly and aggressive, to planets spread throughout the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. He also made efforts to recruit [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officers]] into his forces, focusing especially on those with an [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Intelligence]] background.<ref name=\"XWWS\" />\n\nMany joined him, like the pirate [[Queen/Legends|queen]] [[Leonia Tavira]], the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|ex-Inquisitor]] [[Lanu Pasiq]], and the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[economist]] [[Teubbo]].<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Others, like [[Sair Yonka]], remained loyal to Coruscant.<ref name=\"XWTBW\">''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''</ref> A few persistently rejected Zsinj's attempts at both bullying and bribery, like [[Zel Johans]] and his [[Imperial Hammers Elite Armor Unit/Legends|112th Repulsorlift Armor Regiment]].<ref name=\"SMUIU\">{{Journal|15|Special Military Unit Intelligence Update}}</ref> Through his subordinates Zsinj operated like a rebel force unto himself. Outside of his official borders, his cells controlled territories of varying size, from entire planets down to individual companies. Using a variety of aliases like \"Cortle Steeze\" and \"Lord Houghten Ween,\" Zsinj built up a support network independent from his military force.<ref name=\"XWWS\" /> Having consolidated his forces, Zsinj took over the [[Tion Hegemony/Legends|Tion Hegemony]], extended his protection to the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], and annexed some territory along the Hydian Way abandoned by Ardus Kaine, extending his Empire as far as to [[Bogden/Legends|Bogden]] in the [[Inner Rim]].<ref name=\"Atlas\" />\n\nDuring this time, Zsinj built his Dathomir shipyards, started [[Mining/Legends|mining]] operations on Dathomir's [[Koratas|fourth moon]], and initiated some of his many special projects.<ref name=\"CTD\" /> One of the first of his plots to bear fruit was [[Project Chubar]]. Zsinj took control of [[Binring Biomedical Product]], a company based on the Corporate Sector world of [[Saffalore]]. There, ex-Imperial [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] [[Tuzin Gast]] and his subordinates used genetic and chemical therapy to increase the intellect<ref name=\"XWSC\">''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''</ref> and Human-like qualities<ref name=\"NEGAS\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Alien Species]]''</ref> of [[Alien/Legends|non-human]] [[Species/Legends|species]] such as [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorreans]], [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]],<ref name=\"XWSC\" /> and [[Talz/Legends|Talz]]. Zsinj personally captured samples for the project.<ref name=\"NEGAS\" /> Gast eventually chose to commit [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] in his [[Laboratory/Legends|laboratory]] with a small explosive device, and the most notable success of this project, an enhanced Gamorrean subject named Gamma-9104, was allowed to escape. Gamma-9104 later took the name [[Voort saBinring]] and went on to join the [[New Republic Defense Fleet/Legends|New Republic Defense Fleet]]. Despite this setback, Project Chubar continued on Saffalore and in a secondary laboratory aboard the ''Iron Fist''.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\n[[File:NonGonLon-CE2V1.png|thumb|right|200px|Llon Banjeer, an ally of Zsinj]]\nIn 4 ABY, one of Zsinj's allies, [[Llon Banjeer]], acquired military assets from one of his own allies, the [[D'Asta family]], and [[Battle of the Hast Shipyards|assaulted]] the New Republic's hidden [[Hast Shipyards]]. This attack sidetracked the New Republic's plans to attack both Zsinj and Teradoc for some time.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> In [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]], Zsinj [[Battle of Corsin (5 ABY)|repelled]] an attempt by Mon Calamari Republic Admiral [[Kalback]] to gain a foothold on the Hydian Way at [[Corsin/Legends|Corsin]]. Kalback was overwhelmed by the ''Iron Fist'' and forced to retreat, and the New Republic had to shift their focus to eliminating the mysterious [[Cronal|Lord Shadowspawn]]. In [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], another Mon Calamari Admiral, [[Ragab]], attempted another push up the Hydian Way to cut off some of Coruscant's support from the Pentastar Alignment and the [[New Territories/Legends|New Territories]]. However, Zsinj's Raptors [[Battle of Paqualis|secured]] a key victory at [[Paqualis III/Legends|Paqualis III]], stopping their advance.<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> Viewing both his Imperial and New Republic opponents as inferior<ref name=\"CTD\" /> and driven by his stubborn pride,<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Zsinj eventually felt secure enough in his power to challenge the New Republic directly.<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\n===First strikes===\n{{Quote|He knows I would pluck out his heart and fling it into the streets from the highest tower in the Palace.|Ysanne Isard|X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble}}\nWhile the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]] controlled the Empire proper, Zsinj kept a respectful distance from her territory. Isard herself believed Zsinj was afraid of her. As the New Republic made inroads toward their conquest of Coruscant, however, Zsinj's ambition compelled him to test their resolve.<ref name=\"XWWG\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''</ref>\n\nAfter the New Republic [[Second Battle of Borleias|took]] [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]]<ref name=\"XWWG\" /> in 6 ABY,<ref name=\"ERC\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> Zsinj sent a small force to probe the [[Pyria system]]. A modified [[Dwarf Star-class freighter|''Dwarf Star''-class freighter]] bearing a name that followed New Republic conventions, ''[[Vengeance Derra IV]]'', arrived in orbit of Borleias and used a secret backdoor in the New Republic's identification system to fake a correct ID. Only [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Corran Horn]]'s instinct allowed the New Republic forces to destroy the [[Freighter/Legends|freighter's]] [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]] and [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE Bombers]] and drive the freighter out of the [[Star system/Legends|system]]. The New Republic sent Rogue Squadron on a [[Battle of Mrisst (6 ABY)|retaliatory strike]] against the ''Vengeance Derra IV'' in orbit of [[Mrisst/Legends|Mrisst]]. Rogue Squadron crippled the ''Vengeance Derra IV'', hurt another [[Contruum's Pride|Zsinj-allied transport]], and destroyed a [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] of [[TIE Series|TIE]] fighters.<ref name=\"XWWG\" />\n\n[[File:Ysanne_Isard.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ysanne Isard's cunning leadership was an obstacle for Zsinj.]]\nZsinj's pride would not allow him to let this challenge go unanswered. The New Republic's reprisal set off a series of hit-and-fade strikes against the Republic by Zsinj's forces. Zsinj seriously [[Battle of Noquivzor|damaged]] the New Republic base on [[Noquivzor]], believing he was hitting Rogue Squadron. This caused the New Republic to accelerate their timetable for taking Coruscant. During the subsequent [[Krytos virus]] crisis, Zsinj made efforts to [[Thief/Legends|steal]] [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] from the New Republic. Rogue Squadron and General [[Horton Salm/Legends|Horton Salm's]] [[Aggressor Wing|Defender Wing]] [[Raid on Yag-prime|retook]] a shipment of bacta from a Zsinj-controlled [[Space station/Legends|space station]] orbiting [[Yag'Dhul/Legends|Yag'Dhul]].<ref name=\"XWTKT\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''</ref>\n\nZsinj then acted on intelligence provided to him by Isard to [[Ambush at Alderaan|attack]] a bacta [[Convoy/Legends|convoy]] in [[the Graveyard]] in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]]. ''[[Termagant]]'', one of Zsinj's [[Strike-class medium cruiser|''Strike''-class cruisers]], destroyed a fake Rogue Squadron that Isard's [[Agent/Legends|agent]] [[Kirtan Loor]] had planned to use to turn public sentiment against the New Republic. The real Rogue Squadron destroyed the ''Termagant'', but not before Zsinj prepared a [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] broadcast to Coruscant claiming that he had destroyed the convoy and Rogue Squadron for Humanitarian reasons. Zsinj claimed that the bacta was deliberately tainted by New Republic agents to get rid of the aliens on Coruscant, and implored the population to support him. This HoloNet broadcast was aired worldwide, however his broadcast had the misfortune of being sent nearly twelve [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] after an official report showing the survival of Rogue Squadron. Zsinj was made to appear foolish once again, but the attack caused the [[New Republic Provisional Council]] to make the difficult decision to commit forces to [[Hunt for Zsinj|hunting]] Zsinj.<ref name=\"XWTKT\" />\n\n===After the fall of Coruscant===\n{{Quote|He's as elusive as the ''Katana'' fleet.|Admiral Gial Ackbar|X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble}}\nThe [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|fall of Coruscant]] and Isard's apparent [[Battle of Thyferra|death]] caused many previously loyal Imperial [[Officer/Legends|officers]] and [[Warship/Legends|warships]] to flock to Zsinj's banner, including Admiral [[Apwar Trigit]] and his [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Implacable (Imperial-class)|''Implacable'']]. Zsinj also implemented new special projects and acquired several former agents of Isard's Imperial Intelligence network&mdash;like [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Zurel Darillian]], who lost his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] in the disaster caused by the [[Mission above Imperial City|launch]] of Isard's ship ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]'' from below the surface of Coruscant<ref name=\"XWWS\" /> in 7 ABY.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\nZsinj absorbed the territory of many smaller warlords like [[Terrinald Screed/Legends|Terrinald Screed]], whom he executed,<ref name=\"FH1\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant]]''</ref> and [[Nigel Nivers]].<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> Controlling his forces from [[Rancor Base]] on Dathomir, Zsinj became increasingly ambitious,<ref name=\"CTD\" /> going as far as [[Battle of New Alderaan (Hunt for Zsinj)|attacking]] the New Republic [[fortress world]] of [[New Alderaan/Legends|New Alderaan]].<ref name=\"Atlas\" />\n\n[[File:Zsinj.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zsinj at the height of his power]]\nBut with Isard out of the way, the New Republic was able to commit a [[Solo Fleet|substantial force]], under the command of General [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], to hunt Zsinj.<ref name=\"XWIF\">''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]''</ref> The deployment of this \"Solo Command\" solely to hunt for Zsinj would later be considered one of the most famous demonstrations of the flexibility of the [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|New Republic Defense Force]].<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Following his success in liberating [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]], [[Rogue Leader/Legends|Rogue Leader]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and his unit was assigned to this force. Rogue Squadron was assigned to the ''[[Mon Remonda]]'', and Antilles formed a new [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] unit, later known as [[Wraith Squadron]], to counter Zsinj's tactics with their own innovative ideas.<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\nZsinj allowed his subordinates a degree of freedom in their fight against the New Republic. Admiral Trigit ordered [[Gara Petothel]] to plant false intelligence in New Republic [[Databank/Legends|databanks]] that allowed a small force under his command to [[Ambush at Gravan Seven|destroy]] [[Talon Squadron (New Republic)|Talon Squadron]] in the [[Gravan system]]. Then, unlike Isard, he retrieved his agent rather than killing her. This action, and the attitude behind it, was met with Zsinj's approval. Zsinj and Trigit also implemented [[Project Morrt]], which allowed Trigit to locate and nearly destroy the New Republic forces on [[Folor]]. Only a creative decoy tactic by the Wraiths, who taunted Zsinj's subordinate by labeling themselves with the comical names of \"[[Dinner Squadron]]\" and \"[[Silly Squadron]],\" allowed the New Republic to escape the base. An [[empion mine]], placed in the [[Xobome system]] as part of this project, could have destroyed Wraith Squadron. Unfortunately for Zsinj, they were able to use another creative tactic to foil Trigit. They [[Ambush at Xobome 6|captured]] the modified [[CR90 corvette/Legends|corvette]] [[Ession Strike|''Night Caller'']], killing the ship's captain, Zurel Darillian, in the process. The squadron then made a mission of collecting intelligence on Zsinj and destroying Trigit.<ref name=\"XWWS\" />\n\nBy impersonating Darillian, Wraith [[Garik Loran|Garik \"Face\" Loran]] was able to fool both Trigit and Zsinj long enough to destroy the ''Implacable'' in the [[Battle of Ession]]. The Wraiths discovered that the [[181st Imperial Fighter Wing/Legends|181st Imperial Fighter Group]] under [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]] was apparently serving Zsinj.<ref name=\"XWWS\" /> In reality, the \"181st\" were merely [[Zsinj's impostor 181st Imperial Fighter Group|pretenders]] led by [[Actor/Legends|actor]] [[Tetran Cowall]].<ref name=\"XWSC\" /> They also collected significant amounts of data about Zsinj's secret support network&mdash;for which agents like Darillian were secretly working as overseers and intermediaries&mdash;and attacked much of that network along the way. The fact that Zsinj was negotiating for the services of pirate forces gave the Wraiths a new avenue of opportunity in their fight against Zsinj.<ref name=\"XWWS\" />\n\n===The Halmad lure===\n{{Quote|Is he in such dire need that he must rely on pirates? I don't think so. He's assembling a second navy, perhaps a disposable one.|Voort saBinring|X-Wing: Iron Fist}}\nZsinj learned the identity of the squadron that had deceived him so effectively and decided to target them specifically. An [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] attempt against the Wraiths on Coruscant itself gave the New Republic an idea of how deeply he had infiltrated their sphere of influence. Acting on recommendations from Wraith Squadron personnel, the New Republic Fleet allowed the squadron to set themselves up as a pirate band and harass the planet of [[Halmad/Legends|Halmad]] for the purpose of attracting Zsinj's attention. The squadron was joined in this operation by Lara Notsil, who they believed to be an orphan from [[Aldivy]]. In fact, Notsil was really Gara Petothel, who initially joined the Wraiths for the purpose of aiding Zsinj and joining his faction.<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\n[[File:Raptor-CTD.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Zsinj's Raptors were a prominent symbol of his power.]]\nZsinj did take notice of the actions of the [[Hawk-bat Independent Space Force]], and after bringing the ''Iron Fist'' into [[Halmad campaign|direct conflict]] with them over Halmad, he invited the \"Hawk-bats\" to meet him aboard his flagship. Zsinj put on a show for the Hawk-bats, intending to mislead them about his personality and the discipline of those under his command while he gained intelligence about the pirates. Zsinj's interest was piqued by analysis of the Hawk-bats' combat communications, which had been filtered by [[Comm unit/Legends|communication system]] modifications performed on their [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE interceptors]] by [[Castin Donn]]. The intercepted signals led Zsinj to believe that an Ewok was flying with the Hawk-bats. During dinner with Zsinj, \"General Kargin\" of the Hawk-bats&mdash;in reality, Garik Loran&mdash;spun a tale about his \"most ferocious pilot\", [[Kettch]]. This story vexed Zsinj, as it caused him to doubt the security of Project Chubar.<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\nThe meeting ended with Zsinj asking General Kargin to execute a captured [[Saboteur/Legends|infiltrator]]&mdash;Castin Donn. Donn had been captured while attempting to infiltrate restricted areas of the ''Iron Fist''&mdash;a mission which Antilles had already disapproved. One of the Hawk-bats, \"Seku\"&mdash;a role assumed by [[Dia Passik]]&mdash;agreed to execute the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] as a private commission for Zsinj. Being an expert in body language, Passik believed that Donn had already been killed and that Zsinj's people had installed a pump in Donn's chest to simulate breathing as a test for the Hawk-bats, so she acted before any of her fellow pilots could do anything rash. After Donn's death, the Hawk-bats departed the ''Iron Fist'' without incident, and Zsinj was left with little doubt about their veracity.<ref name=\"XWIF\" /> Soon afterward, Zsinj demanded an inquiry into the Saffalore facility and initiated experiments on a real Ewok, [[Kolot]], to determine the plausibility of Kettch's existence.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nAt the same time, [[Myn Donos]], the only surviving member of Talon Squadron, escorted Gara Petothel to a meeting in [[New Oldtown]] on Aldivy. Zsinj had received her request to join his forces, and dispatched one of his officers, Captain [[Todrin Rossik]], to make contact with Petothel through the real Lara's brother, [[Tavin Notsil]]. Petothel, who had been having second thoughts about joining Zsinj, resisted Rossik's plan. Donos killed Tavin Notsil from his [[Sniper/Legends|sniper]] position, and Petothel killed Rossik. Petothel and Donos returned to the Wraiths, and Zsinj was left confused about Petothel's intentions. Even without Petothel's aid, however, Zsinj soon embarked on one of his most audacious operations.<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\n===The raid on Kuat===\n{{Quote|You're joking. Kuat?|Wes Janson|X-Wing: Iron Fist}}\n[[File:Eaw_Kuat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zsinj launched an ambitious raid on a drydock near the planet Kuat.]]\nDuring the meeting with the Hawk-bats aboard the ''Iron Fist'', Zsinj provided the Wraiths with data on a large-scale attack on \"an orbital refueling and trade station\" for which he was contracting numerous private space forces. The information from Zsinj showed that the facility was defended by a large New Republic force, and implied that the facility orbited Coruscant, though the Wraiths were uncertain what could be in orbit over Coruscant that would merit the risk of a raid. However, the information about New Republic forces was a ruse on Zsinj's part to guard against betrayal by his pirate allies. Analysis of the battle plan by Petothel, the Wraiths' acting [[Computer/Legends|computer]] specialist, revealed the fact that the raid was not on a New Republic facility at all. The attack was against the space facilities of [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]].<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\nZsinj had learned that KDY, still allied with the Empire, was very close to commissioning a new ''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought, ''[[Razor's Kiss]]''. The Empire was about to gain a ship that could challenge Zsinj's own flagship, and Zsinj badly wanted the ''Razor's Kiss'' for himself. He found the weaknesses in the construction facility's security by helping a [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]] in the ship's complement to set up a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] operation. The plan for [[Battle of Kuat (Hunt for Zsinj)|capturing]] the ''Razor's Kiss'' was twofold: a boarding party would seize the ship's bridge while Zsinj's space forces, including the pirates, provided a distraction for [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat's]] defense fleet.<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\nThe plan worked flawlessly until the Wraiths initiated several acts of sabotage. The ''Razor's Kiss'' left the [[Kuat system/Legends|Kuat system]] under Zsinj's command, but [[Shalla Nelprin]] had uploaded a program into the ship's computers which would transmit the vessel's coordinates to the waiting New Republic fleet. Nelprin also stole a [[Senior officer/Legends|senior officer's]] [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]]-equipped TIE [[Interceptor/Legends|interceptor]] and landed on the hull of the ''Razor's Kiss''. At the same time, Voort saBinring crash-landed his interceptor on the ''Iron Fist''. Zsinj's right-hand man, General Melvar, paid the pirates, and the ''Iron Fist'' went to rendezvous with the ''Razor's Kiss''.<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\nAs soon as the ''Razor's Kiss'' dropped out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], it began broadcasting its location. The ''Mon Remonda'' was waiting and Solo positioned his fleet to intercept. Zsinj was stunned, but he steeled himself for a fight and vowed to destroy Solo. This was not to be, however, as the Wraiths' saboteurs made their moves. Nelprin destroyed the bridge [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shields]] of the ''Razor's Kiss'', and the New Republic fleet [[Battle for the Razor's Kiss|pounded]] the undermanned and poorly-defended ship. Zsinj moved to protect his prize, and launched swarms of TIEs. The ''Razor's Kiss'' lost its bridge during the fight, and [[Trooper/Legends|Trooper]] [[Gatterweld]], an Imperial loyalist, decided it would be better for Zsinj to own the ship than to let it be destroyed and attempted to save the ship using the auxiliary bridge. It appeared as if Zsinj would once again turn defeat into victory, but then saBinring reactivated his crashed fighter and attacked the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} own [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generators]], forcing Zsinj to retreat as the ''Razor's Kiss'' exploded.<ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\n===Special projects===\n{{Quote|He's finally decided to come in for a scrap.|General Han Solo|X-Wing: Solo Command}}\n[[File:Zsinj-EC.png|thumb|left|200px|Zsinj's handlebar moustache contrasted with his uniform.]]\nThe loss of the ''Razor's Kiss'' disturbed Zsinj more than he expected. Solo had used Zsinj's own ambition against him, and turned his desire to protect his new possession into a means to hurt him severely. Zsinj resolved not to be as predictable, and began some of his most ambitious plots yet. [[Project Minefield]], an offshoot of Project Chubar, [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] a significant number of non-human members of the New Republic government and fleet, [[Project Funeral]] involved the placement and activation of these operatives, and [[Second Death|Project Blunted Razor]] involved the collection of as much of the ''Razor's Kiss'' debris as possible and transporting it to Rancor Base, where the remains were used to create the ''Second Death'', a crude vessel resembling the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} remains.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nBy executing carefully calculated Raptor raids, Zsinj led Solo into a trap. At the [[Battle of Levian Two]], Zsinj brought in a fleet larger than Solo thought possible. Neither side took major losses, but Solo was forced to reevaluate his course of action. With Solo's approval, the [[Quartermaster/Legends|supply officers]] of Wraith and Rogue Squadrons located a decoy to use as bait for Zsinj. Meanwhile, Wraith Squadron set out to infiltrate Binring Biomedical and investigate its connection to Zsinj, unaware it was a trap.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nAfter learning the truth about Voort saBinring and Kettch, Zsinj consolidated the Saffalore laboratory into the secondary lab aboard the ''Iron Fist''. He then called the heads of the Saffalore facility to the ''Iron Fist''. [[Novin Bress]] and Tuzin Gast's niece [[Edda Gast]] were brought before the warlord to report on possible lost specimens. Bress was forced to admit the possibility that specimens were unaccounted for in the aftermath of Tuzin Gast's suicide. Edda Gast remained calm during the meeting, and when Zsinj presented the [[Doctor/Legends|doctors]] with a pair of [[Blaster pistol/Legends|pistols]] as if inviting them to commit suicide, Gast instead executed Bress. This caused Zsinj to declare her both blameless, for obeying her superiors' orders as best she was able from the limited information they passed on to her, and not stupid, for not killing herself on his implied command. Zsinj then put her in charge of trapping the Wraiths.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\n===Plans within plans===\n{{Quote|Stay, and accept the death you know you deserve!|Tolokai to Mon Mothma|X-Wing: Solo Command}}\n[[File:Monmothma.jpg|thumb|right|200px|New Republic leader Mon Mothma was personally targeted by Zsinj's machinations.]]\nZsinj sent Captain [[Radaf Netbers]] to assist Gast and Binring's own security forces in turning the Binring facility into a trap. Unfortunately for Zsinj, further unorthodox tactics on the part of the Wraiths allowed them to kill Netbers and [[Mission to Saffalore|escape]] with Doctor Gast in their custody. Zsinj flew into a fit of rage and practically destroyed his own office on the ''Iron Fist''. He knew Gast's loyalty was only to herself, and made plans to eliminate her. He also accelerated the Project Funeral timetable.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nProject Funeral was an ambitious endeavor.<ref name=\"CSWEFuneral\">{{CSWECite|III|46|Project Funeral}}</ref> By rapidly brainwashing non-humans and placing agents near them who would activate their programming with unique code phrases, Zsinj would accomplish two objectives: hurting the New Republic directly by assassinating key personnel and destroying New Republic assets, and hurting it more subtly by causing a schism between Humans and non-humans. In a short time, Zsinj was able to sow chaos throughout the New Republic. Shortly before the Saffalore operation, [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Jart Eyan]] was activated to attack Admiral [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]]. After Saffalore, and Zsinj's decision to proceed more rapidly, several more attacks occurred almost simultaneously. [[Tolokai]], a [[Gotal/Legends|Gotal]] [[Aide/Legends|aide]] of [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], nearly killed the [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]]. Two other Gotal [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] attacked a [[Barracks/Legends|barracks]] and a [[Holotheater/Legends|holotheater]]. [[Galey]], a support staffer aboard the ''Mon Remonda'' who had been bribed by agents of Zsinj, activated the brainwashing of the Twi'leks [[Tal'dira]] and [[Nuro Tualin]] just before the [[Battle of Jussafet Four]] using their code phrases, and then personally attempted but failed to kill Edda Gast.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nTualin, a pilot in [[Polearm Squadron]], fired on the ''Mon Remonda'' with his [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor/Legends|A-wing]], and would have successfully destroyed the bridge if [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-sensitive pilot [[Tyria Sarkin Tainer|Tyria Sarkin]] had not anticipated his action. Tal'dira, a pilot in Rogue Squadron, attempted to kill Antilles, but another Force-sensitive, Corran Horn, felt his attack coming and killed the Twi'lek before he could harm Antilles. Despite the actions of the brainwashed Twi'leks, Solo's fleet won the day at [[Jussafet Four|Jussafet]]. Zsinj's attack force was driven off, the Raptors on the ground were destroyed, a number of Raptor craft were captured, and the New Republic's effort to defend Jussafet Four, an Imperial world, drew the attention of Imperial Admiral [[Teren Rogriss]].<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nRogriss requested an emissary from Solo's fleet, and Solo sent Loran to the Star Destroyer [[Agonizer (starship)|''Agonizer'']]. Rogriss and Loran recognized that despite their differences, they had a common enemy in Zsinj. They made an informal agreement to share intelligence, and Loran learned that the fighter unit that was apparently led by [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron]] Fel was not the real Imperial 181st, as the real unit was still serving the loyalist Empire. When Loran returned to the ''Mon Remonda'', Solo took it upon his own authority to accept Rogriss' offer without even consulting [[New Republic Defense Force Fleet Command|Fleet Command]].<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\n===Redirection and misdirection===\n{{Quote|The effect on our immediate group is that I'm obliged to take you three temporarily off active duty.|Wedge Antilles, to the Twi'leks under his command|X-Wing: Solo Command}}\n[[File:Melvar-CTD.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Melvar, leader of the Raptors and Zsinj's second-in-command, implemented his orders faithfully.]]\nProject Funeral was working precisely as Zsinj intended. The actions of the brainwashed Gotals and Twi'leks caused their species to fall under suspicion, and preventative actions that the New Republic authorities felt they had to take caused tension between minority species and the Human majority. In response, Antilles convened the Wraiths and Rogues for a planning session, during which they divined Zsinj's plans and proposed countermeasures. They forwarded their conclusions to General [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]], who dedicated resources to testing the plausibility of Antilles' report. The Wraiths' predictions came true, and the New Republic Intelligence Service thwarted an attempt by [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] pilot [[Rostat Manr]] to crash the cruise liner ''[[Nebula Queen]]''. Since they did so by using one of Manr's Sullustan subordinates, [[Nurm]], as an intermediary, further Human-alien enmity was avoided. NRI also stopped a similar [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] effort to cause a computer-induced explosion at a [[power plant]]. Project Funeral was effectively over.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nZsinj had been leading Solo's fleet into traps, so Antilles decided to use even more unconventional methods to lure Zsinj. A [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]], mocked up to look like the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] and cleverly dubbed the \"''[[Millennium Falsehood]]'',\" flew to [[Kidriff 5]] to make it appear that Solo himself was fomenting rebellion. The ruse went according to plan, but a miscalculation on the part of Captain Loran caused Petothel to flee the Wraiths. Petothel joined Zsinj on the ''Iron Fist'', but her loyalty was still to the Wraiths. She embarked on a plan to plant false intelligence and cripple the ''Iron Fist''.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nBased on their estimation of Petothel's character, Antilles and the Wraiths decided to continue the ''Millennium Falsehood'' plan. With Rogriss' task force operating on one side of Zsinj's space and Solo's fleet working the other, Zsinj's enemies nibbled at his territory. Within a [[Standard week/Legends|week]], Zsinj had lost millions of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], eight percent of his income. Worlds rejected Zsinj's rule, like [[Vispil]], where he lost the [[Carrack-class light cruiser/Legends|''Carrack''-class light cruiser]] ''[[Counterpunch]]'' to planetary defense forces.<ref name=\"XWSC\" /> Zsinj was despondent. Even General Melvar was concerned; Zsinj was acting more pessimistic than he had ever seen. Together, the warlord and his general formulated a plan to stop Zsinj's ongoing losses and restore his sagging confidence.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\n===Turning the tide===\n{{Quote|We kill General Han Solo and as many of his friends and aides as is humanly possible.''\"<br />\"''That will be the most enjoyable part of the operation.|Zsinj and Melvar|X-Wing: Solo Command}}\n[[File:Celchu-Falsehood.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The freighter dubbed the \"''Millennium Falsehood''\" was used to successfully deceive Zsinj.]]\nTo save his empire, Zsinj outlined a five-step plan to Melvar. He wanted to retain control of the ''Iron Fist'', save as much of his support network as possible, eliminate General Solo, retreat to Rancor Base to mend his fleet, and finally, formulate his ''next'' scheme for galactic domination.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nTo accomplish those goals, he followed the advice of the apparently-loyal Petothel. She told him Solo was likely to be found on worlds with prior relations with [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], starting with [[Comkin V]]. When Zsinj's forces [[Raid on Comkin V|engaged]] the ''Millennium Falsehood'', Petothel made a clandestine transmission to the Wraiths telling them of her effort to mislead Zsinj. Petothel told them that she listed [[Vahaba]] as the next likely target in her briefing for Zsinj. Neither side took heavy losses at Comkin, because neither side brought in the bulk of their fleet. Zsinj's own long-established [[Zsinj's doctrine|doctrine]] prevented him from fighting on a battleground chosen by the enemy, and Solo believed Zsinj was spooked.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nBefore the ''Millennium Falsehood'' put in an appearance at Vahaba, Solo had Captain Loran contact their Imperial ally, Rogriss. After a bit of verbal sparring, Loran got Rogriss to agree to loan an [[Immobilizer 418 cruiser/Legends|Interdictor]] to Solo's fleet. After the ''Iron Fist'' crept into the [[Vahaba system]], the Interdictor ''[[Stellar Web]]'' activated its [[Gravity well projector/Legends|gravity well projectors]]. Zsinj was [[Battle of Vahaba|trapped]] until he could disable or destroy the ''Stellar Web'', and he thus focused his fleet's efforts on facilitating the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} escape. When the ''Stellar Web'' was forced to reverse its gravity generators to avoid the impending collision of the crippled [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Serpent's Smile]]'', Zsinj jumped away, believing himself safe.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nThinking he had Petothel under sufficient surveillance, Zsinj did not expect her [[Droid/Legends|droid]]-assisted sabotage. [[Tonin]], Petothel's [[R2-series astromech droid|R2 unit]], had used an army of [[MSE-6-series repair droid|MSE-6 mouse droids]] to gain a limited amount of control over the ''Iron Fist''. Before leaving the Vahaba system, Tonin erased the [[Selaggis system]] from the Star Dreadnought's primary databank and subtly altered its course to take the ship there. Then, Tonin ordered his diminutive droid soldiers to attack the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} hyperdrive. Petothel sent a HoloNet transmission to apprise the ''Mon Remonda'' of the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} incapacity.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\n[[File:Zsinj-NEGC.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Warlord Zsinj]]\nZsinj knew it was time to implement his escape plan. He called in as much of his fleet as he could muster, along with any of his pirate allies that could join him in time. He also summoned the ''Second Death'' for its intended purpose. Since the connection between Wraith Squadron and the Hawk-bat pirates was still a secret to him, Zsinj did not realize that summoning the pirates was what confirmed Solo's decision to engage him.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nThe [[Battle of Selaggis]] was not a long one.<ref name=\"ERC\" /> Zsinj managed to bring in his third battle group, and launched all of the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} fighters except the ersatz 181st and experimental units. Hiding in the belt of [[Selaggis VI]], Zsinj used a tactic he invented on the original ''Iron Fist'' to attack Solo's fighter groups by blowing the asteroids into flak. Only by heeding Myn Donos' hard-earned danger sense were most of the New Republic fighters able to frustrate Zsinj's plans for an ambush. Meanwhile, Petothel escaped the ''Iron Fist'' in her X-wing, with most of the Project Chubar subjects accompanying her in a [[Sentinel-class landing craft/Legends|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] piloted by Kolot, the real Ewok pilot.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nZsinj was getting depressed again. His enemies were anticipating him. And without his knowledge, Petothel's sabotage caused his own ship to transmit detailed tactical data to the enemy. Zsinj's mood brightened, however, when his chief [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]] announced the restoration of hyperdrive capability. Zsinj thus sent the fake [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] Fel and his squadron to cover the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} retreat.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\n===Retreat and recovery===\n{{Quote|Zsinj, I'm not a rich man.

The New Republic forces were obligated to try to protect any [[Colonist/Legends|colonists]] who might have survived when Zsinj attacked the colony five [[Standard month/Legends|months]] earlier. Zsinj's fighters effectively distracted the fighters under Antilles' command, but Solo's main warships were still bearing down on the ''Iron Fist''. Zsinj made his move to escape.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\n[[File:Empire_7-8_ABY.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Prior to his downfall, the size of Zsinj's territory rivaled that of the Galactic Empire.]]\nThe decoy ship ''Second Death'' deployed its [[Orbital nightcloak|Nightcloak]] and made ready to cover the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} departure. Meanwhile, Voort saBinring cut Zsinj's diversionary fighter force in half by [[Jammer|jamming]] their communications&mdash;every fighter in the mock 181st had a droid companion. Zsinj used rigged asteroids to slow the pursuing ''Mon Remonda'' and deployed the experimental TIE Raptors. After pursuing \"Baron Fel\" to the surface of Selaggis' moon, Antilles learned that the leader of the false 181st was actually Cowall, impersonating Fel to distract Antilles. Petothel protected Antilles from a Raptor attack before making her own exit from the battle, which was coming to a close.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nThough retreating from a losing battle seriously hurt Zsinj's pride, the ''Iron Fist'' moved into the concealment of the ''Second Death''{{'s}} Nightcloak. They successfully jumped away as the ''Second Death'' detonated&mdash;turning back into the debris that made up most of its bulk. To outside observers, it looked like the ''Iron Fist'' destroyed itself with a faulty hyperdrive.<ref name=\"XWSC\" />\n\nHowever, the ''Iron Fist'' was intact, and escaped to Zsinj-friendly space. Zsinj put in a [[Hypercomm/Legends|hypercomm]] call to Han Solo from the [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]] of a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class shuttle]], and the two commanders exchanged unpleasantries. Solo offered to let Zsinj kiss [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], causing Zsinj to unleash a colorful series of profanity in several [[Language/Legends|languages]] for almost a full [[Standard minute/Legends|minute]], including a [[Rodese]] phrase Solo recognized as mocking his familial makeup.

Solo's attempt to disguise the ''Millennium Falcon'' as one of Zsinj's Incom Y-4s did not last long, but he managed to fire [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missiles]] into an unshielded [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate/Legends|frigate]]. The ''Millennium Falcon'' rode the ruined [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] into Dathomir's [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]], but there was a surprise waiting on the surface: the [[Witches of Dathomir]].<ref name=\"COPL\" />\n\nThe [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] pursued Solo with Isolder's [[Hapan Battle Dragon|Battle Dragon]], ''[[Song of War]]''. They arrived at Dathomir only to watch the ''Millennium Falcon'' crashing. Isolder and Skywalker followed them in, but they were also captured by a Force [[Witch/Legends|Witch]]. Skywalker was soon reunited with Solo and the princess, but in the skies above Dathomir, Zsinj's forces braced for an attack and, having learned of Solo's presence, General Melvar began to negotiate with the Nightsisters for custody of Solo.<ref name=\"COPL\" />\n\nAs the Rebel intruders made efforts to escape the planet, Zsinj deployed the Orbital Nightcloak to cow the planet's inhabitants into submission. Zsinj directly contacted [[Gethzerion]], the [[Clan mother|leader]] of the Nightsisters, to demand the transfer of Solo. The Nightsister captured Solo, and Melvar took two shuttles to the surface to claim him&mdash;an armed one for himself and Solo, and an unarmed one for the Nightsisters to depart the planet. In a display of treachery Zsinj did not foresee, Gethzerion killed Melvar and stole the armed shuttle. Unfortunately for the Nightsisters' plans, Skywalker drew more deeply on the Force than he ever had before in order to fight them. He staged an attack to free Solo, and then pursued the Nightsisters' shuttle into the Dathomir sky in the ''Millennium Falcon'' along with Solo. With newfound confidence, Skywalker used his Force-enhanced skills to help Zsinj's forces destroy the Nightsisters before attacking the Nightcloak.<ref name=\"COPL\" />\n\nZsinj deployed hundreds of starfighters to stop the ''Millennium Falcon'', but he could not keep Skywalker from shutting down his planet-killing [[Satellite/Legends|satellites]]. When Skywalker realized that the ''Iron Fist'' was within range, Solo reclaimed the helm of the ''Millennium Falcon''. Slipping beneath the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} shields, Solo put in a priority communication directly to Zsinj. The last words Zsinj ever heard were Solo telling him to kiss his [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]]. With his last two concussion [[Missile/Legends|missiles]], Solo obliterated the bridge of the Star Dreadnought.<ref name=\"COPL\" /> In 8 ABY, at what would later be known as the [[Battle of Dathomir (Hunt for Zsinj)|Battle of Dathomir]], Zsinj met his demise.<ref name=\"TEC\">[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{Quote|Not only is the New Republic in dire need of support from the outside, but the bulk of Zsinj's forces are still out there.|Captain Baden Lathe, New Republic Intelligence Service|Cracken's Threat Dossier}}\n[[File:Post-Zsinj_campaigns.png|thumb|right|225px|After the fall of Zsinj, several forces fought for dominance of the galaxy.]]\nWith Zsinj gone, the Hapan fleet moved into Dathomir space and destroyed the shipyard, capturing or destroying many of the late warlord's ships. The planet was free from Zsinj, the Nightsisters were destroyed, and Solo transferred legal ownership of Dathomir to the witches. The grateful world of Dathomir quickly joined the New Republic. Shortly thereafter, Organa [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa (8 ABY)|married]] Solo.

The greatest ''single'' threat to the New Republic was eliminated, but Zsinj's death also left the Empire free to return their focus to the New Republic. Even worse, Zsinj's forces remained active, but lacked direction.<ref name=\"TEC\" /> Many of the Raptor [[Commando/Legends|commandos]] independently committed [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorist]] acts against the New Republic, or joined hardline Imperial factions like [[Ennix Devian]]'s<ref name=\"blogpart1\" /> [[Restored Empire|Kaarenth Dissension]].<ref name=\"blogpart2\" />\n\nAlthough the western part of Zsinj's holdings was annexed by the loyalist Empire, most of the territory of Zsinj's Empire fell to the New Republic,<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> and it was only after Zsinj's death that the New Republic was finally able to [[Taking of Kuat|take]] Kuat<ref name=\"EGW\" /> in mid-8 ABY,<ref name=\"TEC\" /> after failed attempts in 4 ABY and 7 ABY.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\nMuch of Zsinj's fleet was claimed by a number of independent warlords, most notably Teradoc,<ref name=\"TEC\" /> who waited until Zsinj's demise<ref name=\"CSWETeradoc\">{{CSWECite|III|231|Teradoc, High Admiral}}</ref> in 8 ABY<ref name=\"TEC\" /> to declare himself \"High Admiral of the [[Mid Rim]],\"<ref name=\"CSWETeradoc\" /> and rushed to seize the worlds along the [[Gordian Reach/Legends|Gordian Reach]], only to find himself in a [[Post\u2013Zsinj campaigns|three-way war]] against New Republic's Admiral Ackbar and Imperial Admiral Rogriss. In the end, Teradoc was soundly defeated and was forced to flee to the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], establishing a new regime there,<ref name=\"Atlas\" /> the core of which was based on the remains of Zsinj's former Crimson Command.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|A soldier's primary concern is not the establishment of government.

Additionally, he was also known to employ various theatrics,<ref name=\"XWIF\" /> such as consuming non-[[Alcohol/Legends|alcoholic]] beverages and then feigning drunkenness in order to observe the reactions of those around him.<ref name=\"CSWEZsinj\" />\n\nAs a result of his numerous deceptions, some considered him rough and piratical, others saw him as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], and a few thought he was a buffoon.

He was also somewhat volatile at times, launching into violent tantrums, the severity of which his associate Melvar could sometimes predict.<ref name=\"XWSC\" /> Zsinj also held a ruthless martial philosophy, being willing to make great sacrifices, often at the expense of his subjugated worlds, in order to achieve ultimate victory.<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|Do you know he really is a genius?

New Republic Intelligence believed he had received technical training in his youth, but as with many details of his early life NRI was never able to verify this. Zsinj had a fair degree of skill with general computer use, [[Astrogation/Legends|astrogation]], and starship and starfighter engineering, as well as the operations of [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ships]] and [[Transport/Legends|transports]].

He invented a number of combat maneuvers which would later be taught in various military academies, such as the use of asteroids as a natural flak screen.<ref name=\"XWSC\" /> He also had excellent organizational and management skills, as shown in his creation of an entirely new military force, the Raptors, and his ability to maintain a fleet composed of several disparate ex-Imperial elements. In personal combat, he was capable of both short-range melee combat and long-range fighting. Zsinj displayed proficiency with various [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] and [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroweapons]], and even had some skill with [[longbow]]s and thrown weapons. He was also capable of riding large animals.<ref name=\"CTD\" />\n\nIn addition to his military and technical skills, Zsinj was proficient in bargaining and persuasion, and possessed knowledge of bureaucracy and law.<ref name=\"CTD\" /> Zsinj also had the business acumen to maintain a hidden financial empire throughout New Republic and Imperial territory in addition to his own. Until Wraith Squadron assumed the mission of one of Zsinj's underlings, the New Republic was totally unaware of this. He was able to use the protection of his military forces as an incentive for planetary governors to provide him with secret assets, as he did on worlds like [[Viamarr 4]], [[Ession]] and [[Xartun]]. His secret business empire supported his publicly known military forces. He kept those financial holdings under numerous alias, including \"Cortle Steeze,\" \"Houghten Ween,\" and \"Oan Pakkerd.\"<ref name=\"XWWS\" />\n\nZsinj spoke several non-[[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] languages, including [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]], [[Mon Calamarian]],<ref name=\"RES\">''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''</ref> and Rodese.<ref name=\"XWSC\" /> Han Solo recorded Zsinj's final communication to the ''Mon Remonda'' in order to have it translated by a [[3PO-series protocol droid/Legends|3PO unit]].<ref name=\"XWSC\" /> He determined that Zsinj used nearly sixty different languages during his minute-long tirade.<ref name=\"COPL\" />\n\nZsinj's New Republic Intelligence dossier claimed that he was unable to lie convincingly despite years of practice;<ref name=\"CTD\" /> however, his encounters with Wraith Squadron directly contradicted this, as he was able to execute several masterful deceptions requiring personal contact with New Republic personnel.<ref name=\"XWSC\" /><ref name=\"XWIF\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|Without a doubt, Zsinj considered his greatest weapon to be the ''Iron Fist''.|Captain Baden Lathe, New Republic Intelligence Service|Cracken's Threat Dossier}}\nAs an Imperial officer and later a warlord, Zsinj [[Clothing/Legends|wore]] an [[Imperial military uniforms/Legends|Imperial Navy uniform]].

Quelii Sector Fleet,<ref name=\"CTD\" /> and no separate Grand Moff of the oversector was ever specified.\n\nThese details were finally resolved with the publication of ''The Essential Atlas'' in [[2009]], which provided confirmation of Zsinj's position as Grand Moff of the Quelii Oversector and depicted him in a uniform that combined details of all the prior visual and text depictions: a
