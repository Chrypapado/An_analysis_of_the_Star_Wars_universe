His profession was the shipping of goods in his [[anti-grav loader]], the ''[[Seaskimmer]]''. Upon losing a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] at sea, he purchased [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] as a replacement from droid salesman [[Van P. Quist]], separating the droid from his counterpart, [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]].\n\nAfter helping Prince [[Jagoda]] prevent an invasion of R-duba from [[Dorande]], he was made the prince's royal advisor.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[15 BBY/Legends|15 BBY]], Kirk Windjammer went through a difficult period when he went on to purchase [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] Droid at a store. Windjammer did not have enough credits to buy [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and the two droids remained separated. Windjammer was sorry, but sought primarily the [[Astromech droid/Legends|Astromech droid]] for controlling his vehicle, the ''[[Seaskimmer]]''.\n\nKirk and Artoo found a new job at the [[Red Asteroid Bar]]. During their journey at sea, Kirk complained about the high taxes that he was required to pay in order to trade at sea. When delivering their cargo on a Gunship, Kirk discovered that they had smuggled illegal weapons. The two were able to escape and reach the palace of Jagoda.\n\nUnder the direction of C-3PO, who in the meantime had become the Royal Advisor, Kirk and Artoo were encountered during an invasion. Shortly afterwards Artoo and C-3PO disappeared, Kirk appointed as the new Royal Advisor. Kirk's first advice was to never forget the droids. After that, Jagoda agreed to lower taxes and reduce the maritime trade.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Droids (1986) 5|''Droids'' (1986) 5]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CSWECite|III||Quist, Van P.}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-droids-re-animated-part-1|text=The Droids Re-Animated, Part 1|int=The Droids Re-Animated}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Kirk Windjammer\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Windjammer, Kirk}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Vanqor residents]]"}}}]}}}}
