Part of the planet's lower class, he was forced to struggle against the planet's oppressive government, the [[Herdessan Guild]] who had allied themselves with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Sometime after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] came to Herdessa to negotiate a possible membership with the world. Alongside his lover, [[Suzu]], the two attended the arrival of the Alliance delegation and booed when [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] was introduced. They then threw mud at the woman, striking her in the face with a mudball. The planet's [[Herdessan shocktrooper|security forces]] led by the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Lumiya]] chased after the two Herdessans, eventually capturing Finn in [[guild sector three]]. Suzu was able to escape with the help of Organa, but Finn was brought back to the city to be sold into slavery in the lava mines of [[Vanan]].\n\nHowever, Suzu and Organa were able to free the prisoners, and they [[Battle of Herdessa (Nagai\u2013Tof War)|rose up]] against the guild and their Imperial allies. Finn was reunited with Suzu, and the guild members were captured. Shortly thereafter, Organa and the Alliance left the planet to warn the rest of the Alliance of the Imperial's activity. Finn and Suzu likely had a place in the new government which was allied with the Alliance of Free Planets.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 88|''Star Wars'' (1977) 88]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Herdessans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
