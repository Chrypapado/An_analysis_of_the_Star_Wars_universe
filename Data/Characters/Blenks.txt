However, a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Empire's Wrath|apprentice]] of [[Darth Baras]] managed to get inside and sabotaged the generator to force it into the backup mode&mdash;cutting off any excess power drains, thereby deactivating the Organa force field.\n\nBlenks, Organa, Kan'grell and Prinn encountered the Warrior after the apprentice slaughtered all of their troops. Organa decided to make an offer to the Wrath, which he refused. The Sith, who was looking for information about Organa's former handmaiden Jaesa Willsaam, started to torture Blenks, prompting Organa to reveal that the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Jaesa Willsaam]]'s [[Parent/Legends|parents]] were still servants at [[Castle Organa]]. After getting the information on Willsaam's parents, the Wrath executed Organa and her bodyguards, including Blenks, for defying the Empire.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
