Trying to look bigger and tougher than she was.|Enaq, about Kira Carsen|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Enaq''' was an [[Evocii]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived as a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]]. Enaq befriended a young [[Human/Legends|Human]] girl named [[Kira Carsen]], but he and his fellow refugees suffered when Carsen's defense of her friends gave the group a formidable reputation, turning away potential aid.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Be well, my friend. Take good care of Kira. She's our hero.|Enaq, to Carsen's Master|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nEnaq was an [[Evocii]] who, like many of [[Gender/Legends|his]] [[Species/Legends|species]] during the [[Galactic War]] and [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]],<ref name=\"Evocii\">{{TORcite|type=codex|Evocii}}</ref> lived as a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] in the depths of the [[City/Legends|city]]-[[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. He and a group of refugees, led by an [[Anomid/Legends|Anomid]] named [[Darshyn]], lived and worked at the [[Alien Outreach Center]] in Nar Shaddaa's [[High Security Lockdown]] district, providing aid to fellow victims and displaced persons. Around [[3653 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|The Death Mark|Alderaan}} establishes that [[Kira Carsen]] fled the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Empire]] at the age of 10, while the ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]'' states she was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] in [[3663 BBY]]. Thus, a date of [[3653 BBY]] can be derived.</ref> a young [[Human/Legends|Human]] girl named [[Kira Carsen]] joined the group, and Enaq became friends with her. Carsen bundled herself in extra layers of [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]] in order to look bigger and tougher than she really was.<ref name=\"The Merciful One\" />\n\nCarsen stayed with the group for eight [[Standard year/Legends|years]], but during that [[Time/Legends|time]], a gang known as the [[Ur'kossags]] began to terrorize the refugees and rob them. When Carsen paid them a visit and asked them to leave the refugees alone, the Ur'kossags offered the girl membership in their group, asking her to [[Death/Legends|kill]] a [[Unidentified gangster|rival gangster]] as a test. She refused and was forced to kill the entire group with her nascent [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]].<ref name=\"The Merciful One\" />\n\nCarsen was recruited into the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] not long afterward, so she was unaware of how her actions affected Enaq and the others&mdash;because of the Ur'kossags' deaths, the refugees acquired a formidable reputation that prevented other gang attacks but also turned away groups that would typically offer aid, though additional refugees continued to seek aid.<ref name=\"The Merciful One\" /> Two years later,<ref name=\"Time\">{{TOR_dates|1}}</ref> Enaq contacted Carsen and requested supplies and aid, and she readily responded, bringing along her new [[Hero of Tython|Jedi Master]]. However, Enaq and Carsen's reunion was disrupted by a furious Darshyn, who blamed the girl for their lack of supplies and the reputation that her actions gave them. Disheartened, Carsen departed, though she promised to return again soon with more supplies.<ref name=\"The Merciful One\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAn Evocii refugee, Enaq had tan skin and [[Color/Legends|blue]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], as well as black sideburns and a small amount of black [[Hair/Legends|hair]] atop his head. Even though he himself was a refugee, Enaq and the rest of his group went out of their way to provide aid and supplies to other refugees. He did not hold Carsen's killing of the Ur'kossags against her, as he understood that she had been trying to protect her friends.<ref name=\"The Merciful One\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEnaq appears in \"The Merciful One,\" a conversation-mission for the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]-class companion character Kira Carsen in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', a [[video game]] released in [[2011]] by [[BioWare]]. Unlike most companion conversations, \"The Merciful One\" is an actual mission that requires players to travel to Nar Shaddaa with Carsen as the players' companion.<ref name=\"The Merciful One\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Evocii]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]"}}}]}}}}
