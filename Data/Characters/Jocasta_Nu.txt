And is there anyone else in the entire galaxy who can do it? ''Anyone'' who possesses the knowledge I hold from decades maintaining the Jedi Archives?|Jocasta Nu, to Gar|Darth Vader (2017) 7}}\n'''Jocasta Nu''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Gender|female]], was a [[Jedi Master]] of the [[Jedi Order]] who served as the [[Chief Librarian]] of the [[Jedi Archives]] during the last years of the [[Galactic Republic]]. In this role, Nu was the primary caretaker of the extensive Archives, helping her fellow [[Jedi]] find the information they needed while controlling access to several restricted vaults and artifacts.\n\nAlthough she was the Chief Librarian of the Archives, Nu was not removed from other Jedi affairs and, at some point, was a member of the [[Jedi High Council]]. As Chief Librarian, she worked alongside other Jedi such as Masters [[Tera Sinube]] and [[Eno Cordova]]. During the [[Clone Wars]], Nu became involved in a [[Raid on the Jedi Temple|plot]] by [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]] to steal a [[Jedi holocron]], though she and her fellow Jedi failed to stop him from escaping the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] with the artifact. She later helped [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] find the thief who stole [[Ahsoka's lightsabers|her]] [[lightsaber]], aided the Jedi Council in their investigation of Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]]' death, and continued to watch over the Archives.\n\nAt the war's end, most Jedi were wiped out during the [[Great Jedi Purge]] and the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Nu was among the survivors of the purge, and with her assistant [[Gar (human)|Gar]], attempted to preserve what knowledge she had and prepared a [[Jocasta Nu's cache|covert school]] to train future Jedi. Nu decided to return to the former Jedi Temple on [[Coruscant]], knowing that hidden in the Archives was a [[holocron]] containing a list of force-sensitive children. Nu managed to sneak into the Temple and retrieve the holocron. Determined to put a permanent end to the Jedi, the newly crowned [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious]], [[Hunt for Jocasta Nu|dispatched]] his agents, [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and the [[Grand Inquisitor]], to hunt down the former Chief Librarian. Knowing she wouldn't be able to escape Coruscant, Nu attempted [[Death|suicide]] but was foiled by Vader. Vader killed Nu afterward, though he later destroyed the holocron after Nu warned him of what Sidious would do with it. Years after the deaths of both Nu and Gar, the information she kept hidden was found by Jedi Master [[Luke Skywalker]], who used it to try and rebuild the fallen Jedi Order.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Jedi-Dooku-Art.png|210px|thumb|left|Jocasta Nu was on good terms with Jedi Master Dooku.]]\nJocasta Nu was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Coruscant]] prior to the [[Clone Wars]].

[[Cere Junda]] was provoked during the mission and attacked [[Trandoshan]]s, believing that they, instead of the [[Dupei monks|Dupei Monks]] were at fault. The Council decided to send both Junda and her master, [[Eno Cordova]], to Ontotho to help in the excavation of an Ontothan temple.<ref name=\"Dark Temple 1\">[[Jedi Fallen Order - Dark Temple 1|''Jedi Fallen Order - Dark Temple'' 1]]</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]], Jinn and his Padawan learner, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], read over tax bills from the [[Galactic Senate]] in the archives, as Jinn was concerned about them. Although she was friendly with Jinn, Nu refused to help them, much to the annoyance of Kenobi.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref>\n\n===The Separatist Crisis===\n{{Quote|If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist.|Jocasta Nu, to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\n[[File:JocastaHelpsObiWan.png|thumb|right|250px|Jocasta Nu and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Archives]]\nDuring the [[Separatist Crisis]] in [[22 BBY]], Nu tended to Obi-Wan Kenobi when he came to the archives in search of the [[planet]] [[Kamino]], based on information from his friend [[Dexter Jettster]].<ref name=\"AOTC\" /> Jocasta found him staring at a bust of Dooku and provided him a brief history about him and that he left and a while later, he came back as a Sith Lord and that he had once trained his master, Qui-Gon Jinn. When Kenobi said that he doesn't understand why he left, Nu said that it was because he was frustrated with the Council and its ways. She told told him that she wasn't here to give him a history lesson and asked if he had a problem.<ref>{{SWE|characters|jocastanu|Jocasta Nu}}</ref>\n\nKenobi finally told her that he was in search of a [[bounty hunter]] and the supposed mastermind behind [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|a plot]] to [[assassin]]ate the [[senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. Nu was not familiar with Kamino, and noted that since it was not in the Archives, it must not exist. Nu became irritated when Kenobi suggested her records could be incomplete. She left him to his investigations, instead seeing to the young [[Zett Jukassa]].<ref name=\"AOTC\" />\n\n===Clone Wars===\nFollowing the [[First Battle of Felucia|First Battle]] of [[Felucia]] in [[21 BBY]], Nu was assigned [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s Padawan, [[Ahsoka Tano]], to serve as the Jedi Archives new security [[officer]] after the young [[Togruta]] was assigned to Temple duty for disobeying orders. She took Tano on a tour of the archives, and showed her the entrance to the [[Holocron Vault]], explaining that only members of the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] were allowed access due to the sensitive information contained inside and that she herself had not been inside it for years. When Master [[Ord Enisence]] bullied Tano while she was trying to help him, Nu was organizing books as she watched the scene unfold and looked suspicious of the Jedi. When the Jedi Temple was put on high alert due to [[Cad Bane]]'s efforts to [[Raid on the Jedi Temple|break into the Temple]], Nu informed Master Enisence of this after noticing him in the archives working at a terminal seemingly unconcerned. However, she was then knocked out by Enisence, who was actually the [[Clawdite]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Cato Parasitti]] disguised, and also working as Bane's accomplice in the heist. Nu was then dragged away and relieved of her [[lightsaber]] by Parasitti, who [[Changeling|shapeshifted]] to impersonate the Master Librarian. Tano subdued the [[bounty]] hunter after determining that she was an imposter. After Nu recovered, she and Tano took Parasitti away and brought in more security, but were unable to prevent Bane from escaping with a [[holocron]].<ref name=\"Holocron Heist\" />\n\n[[File:SinubeNuTano-LL.png|thumb|left|250px|left|Jocasta Nu introduced Tera Sinube and Ahsoka Tano]]\nFollowing that incident, Nu assisted Tano when she came to the library to examine criminal records to locate the [[Bannamu|thief]] who stole her [[Ahsoka's lightsabers|lightsaber]]. Nu suggested that Tano admit to Skywalker that she had lost her lightsaber, but the Padawan refused due to how often her master told her to never lose her weapon. Nu admitted that finding thieves was not her area of expertise, and recommended that Tano seek the help of [[Jedi]] Master [[Tera Sinube]], an expert on the [[Coruscant Underworld]], to find the thief. She led Tano to the elderly [[Cosian]], who was [[sleep]]ing at a table in the archives. They woke the sleeping Master, and Nu left the two to begin their search.<ref name=\"Lightsaber Lost\">{{TCW|Lightsaber Lost}}</ref>\n\nAfter Master [[Plo Koon]] discovered the wreckage of a [[Starship|vessel]] on the [[desert]] [[Oba Diah moon|moon]] of [[Oba Diah]] that was identified as the ship of former Jedi Council member [[Sifo-Dyas]] and which still contained his [[Sifo-Dyas' lightsaber|lightsaber]] in [[19 BBY]], Nu was asked to brief the Jedi Council on the events surrounding the Jedi Master's [[Death|demise]]. She informed them that Sifo-Dyas' last assignment was to Felucia, where he was killed attempting to negotiate a peace treaty between two tribes. Plo Koon inquired about the status of Sifo-Dyas' body, and Nu informed him that she did not know as further records on the [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre\u2013Naboo Crisis)|mission]] had been ordered sealed. Master [[Mace Windu]] asked who had sealed them, and Nu revealed that the [[Office of the Chancellor|Office of the Supreme Chancellor]] was responsible. Windu thanked Nu for her briefing and she took her leave to allow the Jedi Council to discuss the situation.<ref name=\"The Lost One\">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Master [[Eno Cordova]] arrived on Coruscant. While exploring an ancient [[Zeffo (species)|Zeffo]] temple, Cordova received a vision of the fall of the Jedi Order and rushed to warn the Jedi Council however, none of the Council were concerned and disregarded his vision. The only member of the Order who believed him was Nu, his trusted confidante during his time at the Temple. Nu entered the archive and created a copy of the holocron listing all potential Force-sensitive children across the galaxy and gave it to Cordova to protect. This holocron was hidden in a [[Bogano Vault|Zeffo Vault]] on [[Bogano]], where it remained until the vault was opened by Padawan [[Cal Kestis]].<ref name=\"Jedi: Fallen Order\">''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]''</ref>\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, Nu explained to [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], [[Sammo Quid]], and [[Tai Uzuma]], three [[Jedi Initiate]]s who had passed their [[Initiate Trials]], how [[Jedi Knight]]s chose Padawans. Dume questioned how and why the Jedi settled on that method to choose their Padawans and if anyone had ever questioned it. Nu noted that Dume was questioning it now, but he protested that he simply wanted to know how that method had been developed.<ref name=\"Kanan 7\">[[Kanan 7|''Kanan'' 7]]</ref>\n\nShe separated the Jedi in her mind: the ones worthy for education and the rest of them. As such, she didn't allow the Grand Inquisitor into the higher archives and always hovered over him when she did let him read a datafile or two. This ultimately caused him to turn to the dark side of the Force.<ref name=\"Dying Light I\" />\n\n===Preserving the Order===\n{{Quote|Whoever is seeing this&hellip; It's up to ''you'' now. Don't let our deaths have been in vain.|Jocasta Nu's message she recorded in a number of [[holocron]]s|Darth Vader (2017) 7}}\n[[File:Jocasta_nu_post_purge.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Jocasta Nu, in hiding during the Jedi Purge.]]\nNu survived the [[Order 66|destruction of the Jedi]] and during the early stages of the [[Great Jedi Purge|Jedi Purge]] she attempted to gather and preserve whatever she could of the Order's legacy. Nu went into hiding and started recording holocrons and collecting information with her [[Aide|assistant]] [[Gar (human)|Gar]], in an attempt to start a [[Jocasta Nu's cache|school]] for new Jedi. Nu was included in a list of possible survivors, which [[Darth Sidious]] gave to [[the Grand Inquisitor]]. He was shocked that Nu survived, as he had not seen her fight once in her life. He also told Vader how much he hated Nu. The [[Inquisitorius]] was instructed to [[Hunt for Jocasta Nu|find Nu]], though Sidious requested [[Darth]] Vader to bring Nu to him alive even though he sensed his eagerness. Sidious believed that Nu had a way to access key information for the future of the Empire which was hidden away in the Jedi Archives. He told him that Jocasta had served the Archives for decades and that every relic the Jedi have, they give it to her. He told him that the Jedi were abusing their power and that Jocasta would most likely try to escape their custody.<ref name=\"Dying Light I\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 7]]</ref>\n\nShe realized that the Jedi Archives contained a holocron with a list of every Force-sensitive [[Youngling|child]] catalogued prior to Order 66,<ref name=\"Dying Light II\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 8|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 8]]</ref> and decided to return to Coruscant to rescue it. Gar caught her glancing at her lightsaber, and told her that she didn't need it anymore and that they were done building the archive. However, Nu told him that he misunderstood and that she had to build a school. As Nu was about to leave, she bid him farewell and when Gar, in a last attempt to convince her to stay, asked what could be worth the risk, she told him that since this was a school, it will need students. Soon, [[Imperial shock trooper]]s told Nu to identify herself, but with a [[mind trick]], she convinced them that she was no one and that they saw nothing, in order to enter the Temple.<ref name=\"Dying Light I\" />\n\nShocked at the devastation within, she spotted the [[Grand Inquisitor]] poring over the knowledge she once kept, but forced herself to focus on her mission. Entering a [[Jedi Archive vault|secret vault]] within the Archives, Nu reunited with [[Cator]] and retrieved the holocron, saying that the Jedi will rebuild and leaving the [[droid]] on guard once more, but upon sighting the Inquisitor again, Nu accosted him with her lightsaber, offended that he dared to read her [[book]]s only to toss them aside.<ref name=\"Dying Light II\" />\n\n[[File:GrandInquisitorVsJocastaNu-DLOTS08.jpg|thumb|left|235x235px|Master Nu, confronting the Grand Inquisitor.]]\nHe revealed to her that he was once a Jedi, shocking Nu. Nu told him that he was a traitor and that he had less right in the Archives than she imagined and to meet a traitor's end. He then whipped out his lightsaber, and started a duel. Nu asked why he betrayed his order, but he said the Jedi were nothing and had only shown him the light side of the Force, and that now he knew the whole view of the Force, he can accomplish anything using hatred, and he had lots of hatred. Then he accused her of what she done to him, but she told him that the Archives were very diverse and that if she refused him access, then it meant that she believed he wasn't ready and that it was her goal as Chief Librarian and that since it was once her duty, it will stay her duty. But he said that now she had no duty and tossed her to the floor and said that killing her felt better than he had imagined.<ref name=\"Dying Light III\" />\n\nAfter a brief [[lightsaber duel]] against the Grand Inquisitor however, she was bested and as he prepared to deliver the final blow, he was interrupted by Vader's blocking [[Kirak Infil'a's lightsaber|saber]]. Jocasta closed her eyes and began praying until she discovered what had happened. Vader demanded her alive but the other said that it was a Jedi and that he didn't trust Vader; in the confusion Nu [[Telekinesis|telekinetically]] hurled several books at the two and fled. She later retreated to a [[computer]] access room in the Library and subsequently initiated deletion of the archive files. As Vader continued his pursuit, Nu assembled [[Lightsaber rifle|a weapon]] capable of fighting Vader for the next round.<ref name=\"Dying Light III\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 9|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 9]]</ref>\n\nAfter failing to kill him with the weapon and ruining her lightsaber in the process, Nu attempted to kill Vader by self-destructing it but he managed to redirect it so that it blew a hole in the Temple's outer wall. Grabbing a green-bladed lightsaber from a shelf, Nu took the opportunity to escape out the gap, but was forced to fight off several [[Coruscant Guard]] [[shock trooper]]s led by [[Commander]] [[CC-1010|Fox]], who also fired on Vader by mistake due to Fox neglecting to provide a description of the [[Sith Lord]], something which Nu found greatly amusing. Snapping the commander's neck as punishment for this error in judgement, Vader ordered the [[trooper]]s to take Nu alive, stopping her with [[the Force]] after she attempted to commit [[suicide]] in order to deny them the information she held.<ref name=\"Dying Light IV\" />\n\nRestrained and confined aboard a [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|patrol transport]], Nu was forced to watch as Vader accessed the coveted information: the [[Kyber memory crystal]], containing a list of all known Force-sensitive children in [[the galaxy]]. Though regarded with contempt by the troopers restraining her for being a Jedi, Nu revealed that they were taking orders from one themselves. Vader was in fact fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, which Nu had learned from Cator as the droid held off Vader beforehand. Vader then proceeded to blast all of the shock troopers out of the [[gunship]], killing them in order to keep his secret. When Nu inquired as to what her fate would be, Vader ignited [[Kirak Infil'a's lightsaber|his lightsaber]] but met no resistance from Nu, who accepted her death.<ref name=\"Dying Light IV\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nVader reported back to his master that Nu tried an escape attempt and that she was so careless that she had perished in the process. The Emperor expressed regret at this and told him to come back to him so that he could know more of Jocasta's death and asked if he learned anything from her before she died, while Vader replied that he had learned nothing. The list of names was then destroyed by Vader, to ensure that his [[Sith Master|master]] could not use it to find and train other Sith apprentices.<ref name=\"Dying Light IV\" /> Later on, Sidious told Vader that even though he wouldn't called Vader's encounter with Nu a victory, he couldn't call it a defeat, as the relics she held were fascinating, Jedi and Sith artifacts alike.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 12\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 12]]</ref>\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Fortress Vader]], Vader entered a [[portal]] constructed by [[Darth Momin]] to resurrect his wife [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. While walking through visions, he encountered Nu along with many Jedi with their lightsabers ready to battle him. However, Vader killed all the illusions, impaling Nu through the chest as the words \"[[Ben Solo|Let the past die]]\" resounded in his mind.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 25\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 25|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 25]]</ref>\n\nIn [[0 ABY]],{{Fact}} one of her holocrons managed to make it into the grasp of [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus the Hutt]], who collected it into his collection of Jedi artifacts in the criminal world of [[Nar Shaddaa]]. Vader's son [[Luke Skywalker]], was forced to open all of the holocrons in the collection by Grakkus. As he opened the holocrons one by one, he noticed Madame Jocasta's message and many others.<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\">''[[Star Wars 9]]''</ref>\n\nThough Nu perished on her failed mission to locate prospective Jedi students, her sacrifice was ultimately not in vain. Her secret vault of Jedi artifacts and knowledge was tended to faithfully by Gar for many years until he grew too old to continue protecting it and sealed it by commiting suicide. The vault, and the information inside it, was then uncovered many years after her death by Luke Skywalker, who was [[Jedi Order#A new generation|attempting]] to rebuild the Order.<ref name=\"Dying Light IV\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Get your filthy hands off my books.|Jocasta Nu, to the Grand Inquisitor|Darth Vader (2017) 8}}\nJocasta Nu had white [[hair]], blue [[eye]]s, and light skin.

She was therefore able to use [[telekinesis]], which she could use as a tool or as a weapon, from activating and assembling a holocron to summoning the books in the Jedi library to throw them at Vader and the Grand Inquisitor. Additionally, Jocasta demonstrated skill with the [[mind trick]], which she used on shock troopers to get them to ignore her. Despite her wealth of knowledge however, she was described by Darth Sidious as being \"middling in the Force\" and \"barely competent with a lightsaber\".<ref name=\"Dying Light I\" />\n\nWhile she was well past her physical prime, Nu also demonstrated feats of physical prowess, such as jumping down several stories from a crater made in the wall of the Jedi Temple. As a lightsaber duelist, she was skilled enough to briefly hold her own against the Grand Inquisitor, until she was overwhelmed by his own skill and strength.
