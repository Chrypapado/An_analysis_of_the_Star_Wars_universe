A businessman and captain of industry, Snopps earned appointments to represent Corulag as its [[Senator/Legends|senator]] in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]], as well as its successor, the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]]. When the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] Senate was [[Dissolution of the Imperial Senate/Legends|disbanded]] by [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Snopps was granted a special dispensation to serve as Corulag's Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]]. In that position, he presided over Corulag's ruling body, the [[House of Citizens]], and worked to ensure that the planet's industry and [[Galactic Credit Standard|economy]] thrived under his stewardship. Snopps' position on Corulag afforded him great power and prestige, and he was often left to control the affairs of the [[Bormea sector/Legends|Bormea sector]] while its [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], [[Jamson Caglio]], was on the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] advising the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]]. Well liked by the citizens of Corulag, Snopps was elected to represent the planet in the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[New Republic Senate/Legends|Senate]] once his homeworld decided to join the new [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] coalition.\n\n==Biography==\nZafiel Snopps was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]<ref name=\"CCW\" /> in the [[Bormea sector/Legends|Bormea sector]].<ref name=\"TEA-OC\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-atlas-online-companion|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Atlas'' Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}}</ref> He [[Reproduction/Legends|fathered]] several children, including his youngest son, [[Regenald Hanniper Snopps III]].<ref name=\"TSR\" /> A businessman and captain of industry, Snopps was appointed as [[Senator/Legends|senator]] for Corulag<ref name=\"CCW\" /> to the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"CCW-GRSen\" /> Snopps and Corulag supported [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] during his tenure leading the Republic;<ref name=\"CCW\" /> when Palpatine [[Declaration of a New Order|declared]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]] that the Republic was being reorganized into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] in the aftermath of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]],<ref name=\"ROTS\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Corulag's staunch loyalty was rewarded.

The Union was protesting new taxes on [[Starship/Legends|starship]] berths, and their strike was effectively halting the planetary economy, a situation that Snopps could not allow to continue. After a series of confrontations between the hired thugs and the protesters, union leaders hired a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] to intercede and stop the violence.<ref name=\"CCW\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], after the Imperial victory at the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]],<ref name=\"ERC\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> Snopps refused to discipline the [[Cadet/Legends|cadets]] at the Corulag Academy for abusing members of the [[Exotic Entertainers' Union]] despite protests by their Core Worlds representative, [[Mayli Weng]].<ref name=\"Old Flame\">{{WEGCite|book=Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook|story=An Old Flame in Need...|stext=''An Old Flame in Need...''}}</ref> In [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]],<ref name=\"ERC\" /> the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] was [[Declaration of a New Republic/Legends|established]] as the [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government, displacing the Empire and re-establishing the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|Senate]]. When Corulag allied themselves with the New Republic, Snopps was once again appointed to represent his homeworld in the galactic governing body.<ref name=\"CCW\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nZafiel Snopps was a no-nonsense businessman and captain of industry<ref name=\"CCW\" /> with a hard-edged attitude<ref name=\"ITCW\" /> and a ruthless streak. However, he was a warm individual, who had the ability to inspire confidence and greatness in those around him. Snopps was a good listener, and was able to sense when others hid a motive for their actions, and could be intimidating when he needed to be. His position gave him access to a large amount of information, and he was particularly knowledgeable about bureaucratic and [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomatic]] procedures. His role as an industrialist gave him access to vast resources, and he was able to coordinate his workforce ably.<ref name=\"CCW\" />\n\nSnopps was trained to use a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], and was considered to be an excellent shot. He was also trained in [[Melee weapon/Legends|melee combat]]. Snopps could [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] starships and operate [[Computer/Legends|computers]], and was noted for his ability to play the [[harp]]. He had an [[Eye/Legends|eye]] for appraising items, and could swim. In addition to being able to read, write and speak [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], Snopps could also read, write and speak [[Herglese]]. He wore his Imperial uniform with [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] insignia while on duty, and carried a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] pistol, [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], and [[Datapad/Legends|datapads]].<ref name=\"CCW\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nZafiel Snopps was first mentioned in ''[[The Spira Regatta]]'', an [[Roleplaying game|RPG adventure]] published in the [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 1|first issue]] of the ''[[Star Wars Adventure Journal]]'' by [[West End Games]] in [[1994]]. It was written by [[Paul Sudlow]], and Snopps was briefly mentioned to be a former senator and current Core World governor in the biography of his son, Regenald Hanniper Snopps III. The adventure was subsequently reprinted in [[1996]]'s ''[[The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4]]''. In [[1995]], Sudlow also wrote the RPG article ''[[Into the Core Worlds]]'' for the [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 7|seventh issue]] of the ''Adventure Journal'', expanding on Snopps' character and placing him as the former Imperial senator and current Imperial governor of the Core World of Corulag. 1996's ''[[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook]]'' included a short narrative story entitled ''[[An Old Flame in Need...]]'', which name-checked Snopps in dialogue, and he received a mention in [[1998]]'s ''[[The Far Orbit Project]]'' in the section detailing Corulag and other Core Worlds within the Bormea and [[Darpa sector]]s.\n\nIn [[2003]], Snopps was mentioned in [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s ''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]'', which indicated that he had served as Corulag's senator in the Galactic Republic Senate, as well as the Imperial Senate. In the sourcebook, Wizards of the Coast allowed for the possibility that any of the [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|Roleplaying Game adventures]] could be played in one of several eras, including the \"[[Rise of the Empire era]],\" the \"[[Rebellion era]],\" and the \"[[New Jedi Order era]],\" with only minor adjustments to accommodate changes in galactic circumstances such as the proliferation of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], or the presence of the [[extra-galactic]] [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invaders. For their purposes, Wizards of the Coast defined the \"Rise of the Empire era\" as the time before the Clone Wars, and the \"Rebellion era\" as the period following the end of the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"CCW-6\">''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]'', page 6</ref> This is at odds with the official [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] definition of the eras, which states that the \"Rise of the Empire era\" stretched from [[1000 BBY]] to 0 BBY, with the \"Rebellion era\" ranging from [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]] to [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]].<ref name=\"Publishing era\">{{SWArchive|url=eu/lit/novel/news20001026.html|text=Eras of Adventure|archivedate=20110509000319}}</ref> When detailing Snopps' career, they stated he had served as a senator in both the Rise of the Empire and Rebellion eras, indicating that he had served in the Galactic Republic Senate according to their interpretation of the eras.<ref name=\"CCW-6\" />\n\nIn ''Coruscant and the Core Worlds'', Snopps is the instigator of the adventure hook called \"Strike Breakers,\" which sees him hire thugs to break a strike enacted by the Orbital Transports Union. Depending upon the era of play the adventure is used in, Snopps is refered to as either \"Governor\" or \"Senator\" as appropriate. During the course of the adventure hook, the players are hired by the union leaders to oppose the hired thugs. The players can choose several options, which include investigating Snopps and the political scene in Curamelle, finding damaging information on him and applying political pressure to settle with the union. However, there are several other options available to the players, and this article assumes that while the strike was eventually ended, the exact method used in unknown.\n\nIn [[1991]]'s ''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]'', the character of [[Judder Page/Legends|Judder Page]] is established to be from Corulag, and that his [[Judder Page's father|father]] was the planet's senator during the [[Imperial Period]]. As ''Coruscant and the Core Worlds'' asserts that Snopps had served in the position of Corulag's senator for many years, these two pieces of information seem to contradict one another, or at least hint at a familial relationship between the two. However, to date, no official source has reconciled this information in ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|1|The Spira Regatta}} {{1stm}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=The Spira Regatta}}\n*{{Journal|12|Small Favors}} {{Mo}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook|story=An Old Flame in Need...|stext=''An Old Flame in Need...''}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|7|Into the Core Worlds}}\n*''[[The Far Orbit Project]]''\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snopps, Zafiel}}\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic senators]]\n[[Category:Governors of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Senators]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Senators]]"}}}]}}}}
