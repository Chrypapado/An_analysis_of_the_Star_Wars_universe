He oversaw the [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka]] landing bay Urban 38-3 on [[Citadel Station]], and used his position to cover up the illicit Czerka weapons trade on the station. At the request of TSF Lieutenant [[Yima]], [[Meetra Surik]] confronted Atallo and convinced him to turn himself in, but Atallo was killed by officers from the Czerka Security Division before he could give his confession.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAtallo was originally part of a subquest in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' entitled \"Yima's Suspicion\", in which the player character&mdash;Meetra Surik&mdash;could help Yima uncover Atallo's crimes and either persuade him to confess or blackmail him. Regardless of which path Surik took, Atallo would be killed by the Czerka Security Division after the player met with him.\n\nLike many other aspects of ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords'', this sidequest was eventually cut from the final product, and Surik meets neither Yima nor Atallo in the game&mdash;although the former is mentioned by TSF Lieutenant [[Dol Grenn]]. However, the contents of the journal entries for the sidequest, and the conversation with Yima in which she mentions Atallo, are still accessible in the game's dialog files.<ref>Entries 50529-50532 and 78333-78335 in the ''Knights of the Old Republic II'' dialog.tlk file</ref>\n\nThe sidequest involving Yima and Atallo will not be included in [[The Sith Lords Restoration Project]].<ref>[http://forums.team-gizka.org/viewtopic.php?t=2383 Team Gizka :: View topic - What's (being) restored?], last accessed on August 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{C|cut}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Atallo\n}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Judicial Forces officers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
