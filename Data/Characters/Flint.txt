During the [[Imperial Period|Imperial period]], Flint was chosen by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] as his fourth [[Vader's apprentice|pupil]], following the destruction of his home and death of his mother, [[Zana]]. While Flint was in service as a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]], he received personal training from Vader so that he would eventually face Vader's other pupil, [[Lumiya]], for the honor to be Vader's [[Shadow Hand]]. However, after Vader's death, the showdown took place prematurely, and resulted in Flint becoming the apprentice to the new [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lady of the Sith]], Lumiya.\n\nFlint served under Lumiya as she prepared for the [[Nagai\u2013Tof War|Nagai-Tof War]] and was sent to subjugate the [[Phelleem sector]]. He was also ordered to avenge Vader's death at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] by confronting and killing the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord's]] own son, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. Flint finally had a showdown with Skywalker on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Naldar]], but was unable to bring himself to overcome or kill the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. In the end, his childhood friend, [[Barney]], helped redeem Flint from the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and he turned on his [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] allies. After residing in prison for a time, Flint took to helping displaced peoples from the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. This work continued until he was finally murdered by his old master Lumiya for his ultimate betrayal.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|He's going to get you into trouble someday, Zana, that boy of yours&hellip;He's his father all over again, and you know what that could mean&hellip;|Belderone waitress|Star Wars Annual (1977) 3}}\n[[File:Flint4.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Flint yells for his friend Barney.]]\n\nFlint was the son of a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knight, [[Flint Torul]]<ref name=\"end\" /> and a woman named [[Zana]].<ref name=\"mswa3\" /> Flint's father was killed during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] near the end of the [[Outer Rim Sieges/Legends|Outer Rim Sieges]].<ref name=\"tsgg\">''[[Unknown Soldier: The Story of General Grievous]]''</ref> Whether the Jedi knew of his son or if he was a legitimate child is unknown, but Zana was forced to raise her young son alone.<ref name=\"mswa3\" /> To support their small family, Flint had to begin work at a young age. Zana worked the evening shift as a waitress in a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] while Flint worked in a localized [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] factory that was specializing in the production of [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-ATs]].<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\nAlthough shifts at the factory were strictly enforced by the Empire, Flint constantly had his head in the clouds and dreamed of becoming a Jedi Knight like his father. Zana was in constant worry that Flint might miss his shifts at the factory, but her son's skill as a [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] pilot made sure that he was always on time. Flint's idealism also got on the nerves of his best friend [[Barney]]. While Flint became excited at any change of scenery, even the occasional spacecraft that landed in the [[Belderone/Legends|Belderone]] [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]], Barney always had to be dragged along, not sharing the enthusiasm that Flint possessed.<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\nDuring the height of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|rebel]] heroes [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] arrived on Belderone in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|Millennium Falcon]]. As was their custom, Flint and Barney went to see the craft's arrival. Flint became ecstatic when he saw that Skywalker had a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] clipped to his belt. Although Flint was sure that Skywalker and he had something in common with both of their fathers being Jedi, Skywalker denied it, in part because he had just recently discovered his father's true identity as [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\n===Following a Jedi===\n{{Quote|He's everything we'd like to be&hellip;everything we're going to be, someday.|Flint|Star Wars Annual (1977) 3}}\nAlthough Skywalker refused to acknowledge that he was a Jedi, Flint was confident that Skywalker would be the one to teach him to use [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and he led the rebels into the main city. Flint continued to follow Skywalker around, trying to work up the courage to ask the Jedi to train him. As Barney and Flint tried to casually spy on Skywalker a trio of Imperial [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] attempted to eliminate the rebel crew. The two friends watched as Skywalker's skills helped him easily eliminate the threat.<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\n[[File:Flint-MSWA3.jpg|thumb|175px|Flint becomes a stormtrooper.]]\n\nNow confident that Skywalker was a Jedi, Flint decided to show the rebels the AT-AT factory on the world, knowing that they would want to eliminate it to weaken the Imperials' hold on the planet. However, when the group finally arrived at the factory they found it swarming with troops, including several active AT-ATs that were making their way towards Flint's hometown. As the rebels signaled their allies to attack the monstrous machines, Flint and Barney jumped in a landspeeder and sped towards town in hopes of warning the general populace, especially Flint's unaware mother. Unfortunately, Flint's piloting skills failed him and he crashed the craft just on the outskirts of the city. Flint and Barney were both knocked unconscious.<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\nWaking up the next morning, Flint found Barney still unconscious and believed him to be dead. One of the AT-ATs had managed to escape the rebel assault and had destroyed Flint's town. As Flint looked at his destroyed home, he realized that he had not been able to warn his mother in time, and sprinted into the city. Seeing his mother's cantina completely destroyed, he expected the worst. Among the wreckage Flint found his mother's lifeless body and broke down into a state of despair. He had not known how serious the situation was and blamed the rebels for allowing him to believe that he could make a difference.<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\nFlint promised himself that he would become someone who mattered, someone who would show everyone that he was not worthless. As Flint spoke his promises out loud, Darth Vader arrived and recognized the power within Flint. He told the young man that he could make Flint someone of great importance and offered him a place by his side. Flint happily agreed and decided to join the Empire. Vader immediately made Flint into one of his many [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], promising that in time he would train him to use the Force.<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\n===Fall to the dark side===\n{{Quote|Maybe&hellip;maybe he was never as interested in the Rebellion and the Empire&hellip;or good and evil&hellip;as he thought. Maybe all he ever really wanted was power. And it just took this to make him see it.|[[Barney]]|Star Wars Annual (1977) 3}}\n[[File:FLINT.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Flint in his signature armor.]]\n\nBefore long, Flint began to receive personal training from Darth Vader. Just as with Vader's other illegitimate apprentices such as [[Lumiya]], and [[Galen Marek]], Flint was kept secret from [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Flint slowly developed his Force powers eventually mastering the art of [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]] and was able to sail boulders through the air with ease.<ref name=\"sw92\" /> Unknown to Flint, Vader was preparing him for a showdown with Lumiya to determine who would become his [[Shadow Hand]] when he decided to overthrow Palpatine.<ref name=\"end\" />\n\nHowever, before this could take place, Vader died along with Palpatine at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].<ref name=\"rotj\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> Vader's death affected Flint greatly. He had grown to love Vader and saw him as the father he never had. With his beloved mentor's death, Flint retreated to the planet [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]] to grieve, eventually making his way to [[Bast Castle]]. In a state of despair, Flint was disturbed in his mourning by the arrival of Lumiya. After a fierce confrontation, Flint was defeated and taken on as Lumiya's first apprentice.<ref name=\"end\" />\n\nWith the roles of master and apprentice decided, Lumiya ordered Flint to subjugate the [[Phelleem sector]] while she prepared for the arrival of the [[Nagai]] and their [[Nagai\u2013Tof War|imminent invasion]]. Flint was also given one final task, one which he was more than happy to accept: a mission to kill Luke Skywalker. Flint knew that Skywalker would eventually come to him as he and his men slowly conquered the Phelleem sector.<ref name=\"tep\">{{GamerCite|5|The Emperor's Pawns}}</ref> Flint's reputation eventually led to an identity as the [[Dark Lord of Belderone]] in which he wore extravagant armor and wielded a red-bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"sw92\" />\n\n===Reunion===\n{{Quote|All I ever wanted, my whole life, was to become a Jedi Knight, and you&hellip;you&mdash;! I went to you, I wanted training. You didn't just spurn me, I was beneath your notice.|Flint|Star Wars (1977) 92}}\nFlint's campaign in the Phelleem sector eventually led to the planet [[Naldar]] and a series of brutal [[Subjugation of Naldar|battles]] took place. The entire royal family of Naldar was wiped out except for young [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Vila]] who left to find help from the Rebellion. Her [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] landed on the [[Endor/Legends|forest moon of Endor]], and Vila requested to be trained as a Jedi by Luke to save her people from Flint's forces. Luke, Leia, and Barney decided to accompany her to Naldar. During the trip, Luke Skywalker was warned by the [[Force ghost]]s of Obi-Wan Kenobi, [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] that only he could redeem Flint. Anakin pleaded with Luke to undo the damage to Flint that he had done as Vader and was now unable to undo himself.<ref name=\"sw92\" />\n\n[[File:Flint-MSW92.jpg|thumb|200px|Flint reveals himself to Luke Skywalker.]]\nMeanwhile, Flint waited for the rebel's return, preparing an ambush for anyone that decided to rescue Naldar. Eventually Flint's forces witnessed the arrival of the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] and surrounded the rebels. Flint told his men to stand down, and he personally confronted Luke, igniting his lightsaber. Luke and Flint engaged in a furious duel, matching each other blow for blow. Luke tried to reach out to Flint and convince him to turn away from the dark side, but Flint refused to listen. Eventually, one of Flint's stormtroopers was able to hit Luke in the arm with a carefully placed blaster shot, ending the fight. Now with the upper hand, Flint revealed to the rest of the rebels that he and his forces had prepared an enormous energy cannon to destroy the rest of the city and that it was too late to stop its activation.<ref name=\"sw92\" />\n\nHowever, before Flint could signal his troops, his old friend Barney confronted him. Flint was shocked to see Barney still alive, and his resolve weakened. Barney asked Flint to turn away from the Empire and reexamine the atrocities that he had committed. The Dark Lord of Belderone found that he could not continue in his actions any longer and began to repent. One of Flint's stormtroopers witnessed his betrayal and prepared to execute his commander for his [[Treason/Legends|treason]]. However, the Imperial [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] bolt meant for Flint was intercepted by Vila, mortally wounding her. With another death on his conscience, Flint could no longer serve the Empire, and in his last act as a Dark Lord, he self-destructed the energy cannon, killing his Imperial allies and winning the day for the Rebellion.<ref name=\"sw92\" />\n\n===Redemption===\nAfter his defection and capture, Flint was kept in a cell of [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Mandalorian iron|iron]] on an Alliance safe-world for many years, in order to overcome his traumatic experiences as a darksider.<ref name=\"end\" /> He was eventually reformed and returned to Belderone to live out a simple life.<ref name=\"egtas\" />\n\nAfter the destruction of the [[Crseih|Crystal Star]] in the [[Crseih system]], the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] sought to find a new home for the dislocated and enslaved [[Firrerreo]] freed by Leia and [[Rillao]]. With a passionate plea, Flint persuaded the Belderonian people to accept the Firrerreos to their world,<ref name=\"egtas\" /> although the two groups would later develop a rivalry which the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] manipulated to lead to the mutual extinction of both peoples.<ref name=\"fh1\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant]]''</ref>\n\n===Death===\nFollowing the fall of the [[Disciples of Ragnos]], Flint's body was found on Belderone, having apparently been stabbed through the throat by a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] or a [[Lightwhip/Legends|lightwhip]]. It appeared that Lumiya had taken revenge on her former pupil, after having vowed to deal with his treachery many years before.<ref name=\"end\" /> Flint was replaced by [[Carnor Jax]], who almost took Palpatine's place on the throne.<ref name=\"end\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Flint3-MSW92.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Flint turns away from the dark side.]]\n\nFlint was an enthusiastic and compassionate individual during his early life. Much the same as Luke Skywalker, he had a dream to go off-world and become a Jedi like his father before him. However, when Flint finally thought that he had found someone just like him when Skywalker visited the world, the Jedi denied it, pushing Flint away. Although Flint's dream to be trained as a Jedi was hurt by Skywalker's refusal, he still maintained a positive attitude, trying to impress Skywalker enough to change his mind. This came to a crashing halt following the Empire's attack on his home town. He became a bitter and cynical individual, coming to an understanding that rising up against the status quo was a foolish idea.<ref name=\"mswa3\" />\n\nAfter his recruitment into the stormtrooper corps, Flint still kept a picture of his mother with him to remind him of his former life.<ref name=\"mswa3\" /> However, his training under Vader completely warped his view toward events of the past, and he blamed Skywalker for his mother's death and the destruction of his town. When Flint finally came under Dark Lady Lumiya's influence, he was enveloped in hatred for the Jedi and was eager to track him down and punish him.<ref name=\"tep\" /> When Flint finally faced Skywalker in a duel, he stated that he had purged himself of fear. The fight proved otherwise, and Flint's offensive was battered aside. He was only saved by a loyal stormtrooper hitting Skywalker with a blaster shot.<ref name=\"sw92\" />\n\nFlint's hatred was finally broken by his friend Barney who finally reached Flint and reminded him of the truth about his mother's death. With his head finally clear, Flint was able to realize the evil he was perpetuating. He turned on his Imperial allies and repented, submitting to New Republic authority.<ref name=\"sw92\" /> Flint was obviously reformed during his imprisonment, and he was soon back to his compassionate ways, using his enthusiasm to help persons recover from the war.<ref name=\"egtas\">[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]</ref> Flint died as a hero of the peace and a lesson to the dangers of the dark side.<ref name=\"end\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|I'm going to learn&hellip;I'm going to get the same training&hellip;the same training my father had&hellip;I'm going to become someone who matters&hellip;and then I'll show them all!|Flint|Star Wars Annual (1977) 3}}\nFlint had an exceptional skill at controlling the landspeeder, which allowed him not to miss his shifts at the AT-TE factory. Although Flint was confident in his skill, it failed him when he rushed to warn his mother. Flint had enough Force potential to be chosen as Darth Vader's apprentice,<ref name=\"mswa3\" /> but not enough to defeat Lumiya.<ref name=\"end\" /> After his training under Vader and Lumiya, Flint became adept at telekinesis, being able to push aside one of the stormtroopers on Naldar and to manipulate a boulder behind Skywalker's back. Flint was also skilled with the lightsaber and successfully utilized it against Skywalker. The latter himself acknowledged that Flint almost matched him in physical prowess and strength.<ref name=\"sw92\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFlint was created by [[Mary Jo Duffy]] for use in the [[Star Wars (1977)|Marvel Star Wars]] comic series. The character had a backstory much the same as Luke Skywalker with a missing father that had been a Jedi Knight as well as an idealistic temperament and wish to go off-world. However, the character's final fate was ending up working for the Empire instead of against it. With these opposite fates and outcomes, it's likely that the character was made as a \"what could have been\" character in relation to Luke. Artist [[Jan Duursema]] viewed him as an analogy for Luke, sort of a, 'What if Luke had gone to the dark side?' kind of story.<ref name=\"Circle\">{{SWArchive|url=eu/lit/comics/f20020718/indexp3.html|text=The Circle is Now Complete: Classic Marvel Talents - Randy Stradley & Jan Duursem|archivedate=20050210232919}}</ref>\n\nIt also deserves to be mentioned that Flint's character begins his journey onto the dark path after seeing the death of his mother. This is notable because his mentor, Darth Vader, also witnessed the death of his mother before starting on the path towards the dark side. This information about Vader was revealed after the release of the Marvel comic during the [[prequel trilogy]] which makes this connection all the more interesting.\n\nFlint was used once again near the end of the Marvel series where Flint finally had a showdown with Luke. The fight was the first lightsaber battle between two [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force users]] shown in the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]], aside from the Luke-Vader battle in ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', the battle he had with [[Kharys]] in the [[Star Wars Annual (1977) 1|''Star Wars Annual'' (1977) 1]], and disregarding the fight that Luke had with [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Orman Tagge/Legends|Orman Tagge]] who was not a Force-sensitive individual. It's interesting to note that the trick that Flint tries to use on Luke during the duel (flying a boulder through the air at Luke's back) is used again by [[Carnor Jax]] in his duel with [[Kir Kanos]] during ''[[Star Wars: Crimson Empire]]''. This is even more interesting considering later [[retcon]]s which made Jax the replacement [[Shadow Hand|apprentice]] to Lumiya following Flint's capture.\n\nWhen ''Star Wars'' artist Jan Duursema and writer Jo Duffy designed Flint's armor for the Marvel comic story ''The Dream'', they wanted to hint at the samurai influences on Darth Vader's costume, but also wanted to pull in something stylistically unique to Flint. Duursema researched Far Eastern armor, as well as medieval armor, and tried to come up with a blend for Flint's costume.<ref name=\"Circle\" />\n\nFlint was unreferenced until a minor reference in [[1995]]'s ''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' which mentioned his exploits in the Marvel run. New information on Flint eventually came in [[2001]] in [[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']] which mentioned Flint's work with the displaced [[Firrerreo]] species. He was then referenced again later that same year in [[Abel G. Pe\u00f1a]]'s first article, ''[[The Emperor's Pawns]]'' which among other things, confirmed Flint's apprenticeship to Lumiya during the Marvel series. After this, Flint was mentioned in another Pe\u00f1a work, ''[[Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties]]'' which finally referenced Flint's death at the hands of Lumiya.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the character of Flint was involved in the first works of both Abel G. Pe\u00f1a and [[Jan Duursema]] who did the art for ''Star Wars 92: The Dream'', since both are fairly popular with the current Star Wars fandom.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars Annual (1977) 3|''Star Wars Annual'' (1977) 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 92|''Star Wars'' (1977) 92]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|11|ComicScan|ComicScan: Paint Him Black}}\n*{{CollectorCite|5|ComicScan|ComicScan: 20 Tales To Tantilize}}\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*{{GamerCite|5|The Emperor's Pawns}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/88/indexp2.html|text=Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties|int=Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties|archivedate=20110629021310}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/source/nagai11202009/index.html|text=The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs|int=The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs}}\n*{{DB|character|lumiya|Lumiya|archivedate=20110818073245}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box|\n|title=[[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] (with [[Lumiya]])<ref name=\"end\" />\n|years=[[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]<ref name=\"sw92\" />\n|before=[[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]<ref name=\"end\" />\n|before-years=[[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]&ndash;4 ABY<ref name=\"JVS\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref>\n|after=Lumiya with [[Carnor Jax]]<ref name=\"end\" />\n|after-years=4 ABY&ndash;[[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]]<ref name=\"end\" />\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Flint\n|pt=Flint\n|ru=\u0424\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0442\n|tr=Flint\n}}\n\n[[Category:Belderonians]]\n[[Category:Dark Side Adepts]]\n[[Category:Former Sith]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Jedi Order members]]\n[[Category:Sith Lords of Lumiya's Sith]]\n[[Category:Sith rejects]]\n[[Category:Stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
