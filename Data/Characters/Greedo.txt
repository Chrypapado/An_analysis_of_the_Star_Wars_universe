During the [[Clone Wars]], he was hired by the [[Trade Federation]] to kidnap [[Chi Eekway Papanoida]] and [[Che Amanwe Papanoida]], the daughters of [[Chairman]] [[Notluwiski Papanoida|Papanoida]], but was forced by the chairman to lead him and his son [[Ion Papanoida|Ion]] to them. He was occasionally hired by [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] for various [[mercenary]] jobs, including the capture of [[Han Solo]], who [[Death|killed]] the luckless Rodian.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.|Wald|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222213817/http://starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/greedo/}}\n[[File:GreedoTheElderTPM.jpg|thumb|180x180px|right|Greedo on Tatooine in his youth.]]\nOriginally [[Homeworld|hailing]] from the [[swamp]] [[planet]] of [[Rodia]],<ref name=\"USW\" /> during his youth, Greedo relocated and lived on the [[desert]] planet of [[Tatooine]]. After the [[Slavery|slave]] [[Gender|boy]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] won the famous [[Boonta Eve Classic]], beating the renowned [[Dug]] [[Boonta Eve Classic Podracer pilot|racer]] [[Sebulba]], Greedo jumped to the conclusion that he had cheated. Angered by the false accusation, Skywalker consequently found himself entangled in a fight with the young [[Rodian]]. The fellow young Rodian [[Wald]] warned Greedo that if he continued to pick on fights, he would eventually meet with a bad end.<ref name=\"SWEGreedo\" />\n\n===Criminal career===\n{{Quote|You're one dead Rodian, pal.

At some point in the war, he and another [[Unidentified Gotal bounty hunter|mercenary]] were hired by the [[Trade Federation]] to [[Kidnapping of the Papanoida daughters|kidnap]] [[Chairman]] [[Notluwiski Papanoida|Papanoida's]] daughters, [[Che Amanwe Papanoida|Che Amanwe]] and [[Chi Eekway Papanoida|Chi Eekway]], to use as leverage for [[Pantora]] to join the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. In the ensuing struggle, Che struck Greedo with an [[Icon of the Moon Goddess|idol]], covering its base with the Rodian's [[Color Graphix|green]] [[blood]]. After finding this blood sample while investigating his daughter's kidnapping, Chairman Papanoida and his son [[Ion Papanoida|Ion]] tracked the bounty hunter to [[Jabba's Palace]] and presented the evidence to Jabba, who then forced Greedo to bring the [[Pantoran]]s to the [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina|cantina]] in [[Mos Eisley]] where Che was being held. In the ensuing [[Rescue in Chalmun's Cantina|firefight]], Greedo managed to slip away while the family gunned down the rest of Che's captors.<ref name=\"SOI\" />\n\nDuring [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s exile to Tatooine in the [[Imperial Era]], Greedo was confronted by a blaster-armed [[Sullustan]] down the backalley of [[Chalmun]]'s [[Spaceport]] [[Cantina]].<ref name=\"SW 28\">[[Star Wars (2015) 28|''Star Wars'' (2015) 28]]</ref>\n\nLater, while continuing his work for Jabba, Greedo captured [[Figrin D'an]] of [[Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes]] and delivered him to Jabba, after which D'an and his [[band]] entered into indentured servitude under Jabba, due to D'an being in heavy debt to him. During their [[time]] there, the group kept tabs on Greedo using their superior hearing abilities, seeing how he would bring in small-time criminals, help them to escape, then bring them back to re-collect the [[bounty]]. At one point, they discovered Greedo bringing in one [[Unidentified Jawa prisoner|unfortunate]] [[Jawa]] three times. Upon gaining enough money to free themselves, the band told Jabba of these events, which made him furious. This resulted in a grudge between Greedo and the band.<ref name=\"notfornothing\">{{Shortstory|story=Not for Nothing|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greedo_lightsaber_theft.jpg|thumb|right|224x224px|Greedo stealing Mundi's lightsaber.]]\nDuring the [[trade wars]], Greedo was hired by Jabba to eliminate [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]] [[Vice Chairman]] [[Anolo]] on [[Mygeeto]] and acquire his [[Unidentified Givin codebreaker|Givin codebreaker]]. There, Greedo, [[Barada]], and several of Jabba's thugs led an assault against the Vice Chairman and his guards. Greedo was able to [[Death|kill]] Anolo and put the codebreaker into [[Anolo's Office]]. In the office, Greedo used Anolo's [[Ki-Adi-Mundi's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to make his escape with the Givin. However, Greedo was unable to capture the Givin and it fell to its death. Greedo returned to Tatooine and went on his knees before Jabba at his palace. Greedo offered the [[lightsaber]] to Jabba, but the Hutt refused it and faced Greedo with the prospect of becoming the [[rancor]] [[Pateesa]]'s [[Diet|food]]. However, Greedo was saved when the antiques [[collector]] [[Dok-Ondar]] offered to buy the lightsaber from Jabba.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge 2\">[[Galaxy's Edge 2|''Galaxy's Edge'' 2]]</ref>\n\n===Chalmun's Cantina===\n====Collecting debts====\n{{Quote|Greedo the Rodian is making a play for Solo.

Greedo was humiliated briefly at the Mos Eisley cantina when he was tripped by a piece of the instrument used by [[Ickabel G'ont]], a member of the Model Nodes.

When Solo replied that he would rather die than give up his ship, Greedo said that was indeed the idea before announcing that it was something he had been looking forward to for a long time. As Greedo pulled his trigger and said that he would end with him, Solo shot Greedo dead from beneath the table with his readily prepared [[Han's heavy blaster pistol|blaster]].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> Greedo missed Solo completely<ref name=\"kloohorn\" /> and the last thing that Greedo ever saw was a flash of bright light with a memory of bitter injustice.<ref name=\"thelucklessrodian\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|\u00abJabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.

He was played by [[Paul Blake]] and voiced by [[Larry Ward]].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> In the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' episode \"[[Sphere of Influence]],\" Greedo was voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].<ref name=\"SOI\" />\n\nBlake played Greedo in the shots that feature both Greedo and Han Solo in the same frame.

In the original shoot, Greedo has long, suction-cup tipped fingers, and in pickups, he has swollen knuckles and shorter fingers. The Greedo mask and tunic are currently on display as part of the \"Out of this World: Extraordinary Costumes from Film and Television\" in the [[Wikipedia:Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction Museum & Hall of Fame]] in Seattle, Washington.<ref name=\"Music Project\" /> [[George Lucas]] called upon [[Ben Burtt]] to come up with a voice for [[Greedo]], the first Rodian in ''Star Wars''. Linguist [[Larry Ward]] provided the voice over, and it was Burtt's job to make the voice interesting. At first, the word \"oink\" was going to be manipulated with \u201cthe right rhythm and electrical equipment\u201d to make a bizarre-sounding language, but they  were unhappy with the result. Burtt and a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley UC Berkeley] grad student went through multiple languages including the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages Quechua], and they created their own. A combination of multiple languages paired with expert editing were used to create Greedo's voice.<ref name=\"Much to learn\" />On the other hand, while Ward did provide little bits of Greedo's voice, Blake also provided some of words as well, which were later scrambled electronically, but none of their voice work was done at [[Elstree Studios]]. According to Blake, however, Greedo was just referred as \"The Alien\" in the script.<ref name=\"Greedo Speaks\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/star-wars-greedo-maclunkey-disney-plus-exclusive-interview|title=Greedo Actor On 'Maclunkey': 'It Confused Me Incredibly' \u2013 Exclusive|author=Travis, Ben|date=2019-11-14|publisher=empireonline.com|archivedate=20200329063525}}</ref> Aragon claims that George Lucas practically saved her life when he saw her making odd vestures to signal that she couldn't breathe in the mask.<ref name=\"Much to learn\" />\n\nGreedo's manner of death has been subject to a number of [[retcon]]s over the years. The most famous involves the question of [[Han shot first|who shot first]], for in the original release of the film, as well as the script, Greedo did not shoot at Han at all. In the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 special editions|1997 re-release of the film]], Greedo gets a badly-aimed shot at Solo before Solo kills him. [[George Lucas]] has said that this change is to enhance Solo's overall heroism, making him seem less of a killer and more of a \"cowboy\" to viewers. This was a controversial decision and in the [[2004]] version the two shots are almost simultaneous, with Greedo shooting first.
