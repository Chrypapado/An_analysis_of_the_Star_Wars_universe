Members of this elite fighting force wore ornate grey armor with maroon highlights and wielded [[Laser lance/Canon|laser lances]] in combat.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\nTheir primary function was protecting the current monarch of Onderon, who at the time of the [[Clone Wars]] was [[King]] [[Ramsis Dendup]]. After Dendup was overthrown by the Separatists, the Royal Onderon Militia for the most part went along with the regime change, protecting the Confederate-installed ruler [[Sanjay Rash]], though it was speculated by [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] General [[Kalani]] that some of their members were in fact helping the [[Onderon rebels]] against the Confederacy judging by the sophistication and coordination of their weapons and actions.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\nWhatever the case, the Militia as a whole backed the rebels after their leader,<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" /> [[General]] [[Akenathen Tandin]],<ref name=\"TCW CE\" /> defected to the rebels after finding sympathy with one of their leaders. Backing King Dendup, the Militia were placed under the overall command of the rebel leader, [[Steela Gerrera]], and battled alongside the rebels against the droid army. Though several died when the droids unveiled new [[HMP droid gunship]]s, and two more were slain defending King Dendup from commando droids, the Onderonian army won the day and Dendup was restored to the throne. However, Steela was unfortunately killed in the final battle. At her funeral, two Militia members served as guards of honor.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\n{{Military-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|The Soft War}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|Tipping Points}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/the-soft-war-episode-guide|text=\"The Soft War\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}} {{1stID|Onderon royal militia and Onderon royal guard}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles]]'' {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Milicia Real de Onderon\n|ja=\u30aa\u30f3\u30c0\u30ed\u30f3\u8fd1\u885b\u5175\n|pl=Kr\u00f3lewska Milicja Onderonu\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f \u041e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n|tr=Onderon Kraliyet Milis G\u00fc\u00e7leri\n}}\n\n[[Category:Culture of Onderon]]\n[[Category:Onderon military personnel]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
