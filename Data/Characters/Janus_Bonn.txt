He was the son of a wealthy noble, attending the best schools and eventually volunteering for service to the Empire upon graduation. Rising through the ranks, he became an assistant to [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Lord Vader: Operation Yavin Kill Two is proceeding according to your plan. This message is to inform you that the Rebel operatives known as the Heroes of Yavin have arrived at Mining Outpost 11 and will shortly be proceeding to Asteroid 7785. We look forward to your imminent arrival and will continue to go ahead as planned.|Captain Janus Bonn, in a holocall message to Lord Darth Vader|Graveyard of Alderaan}}\nJanus Bonn was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]], the son of a wealthy [[Noble/Legends|noble]]. Immersed in the [[Human High Culture]] philosophy espoused by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], he attended the best [[University/Legends|university]] available to him, graduating with honors. Upon graduation, Bonn volunteered to serve in the [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial Military]].<ref name=\"GoA:V2\" /> As a young [[Officer/Legends|officer]], Bonn was assigned as an assistant to [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], and his ascension through the ranks of the Imperial Military bore similarities to Vader's own rise; Bonn utilized displays of power, deceit, and even [[Death/Legends|murder]]<ref name=\"GoA\" /> to distinguish himself in a relatively short career.<ref name=\"GoA:V2\" /> He was promoted to the rank of [[Captain/Legends|captain]] around the same time that Lord Vader was assigned to assist [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]] and the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] project.<ref name=\"GoA\" />\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Lord Vader was placed in command of a [[Death Squadron/Legends|fleet]] charged with tracking down the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Vader assigned Bonn to prepare a [[Operation Yavin Kill Two|trap]] for the [[Heroes of Yavin/Legends|Heroes of Yavin]] in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]], using rumors that the [[Aldera Royal Palace]] had been found intact in the [[The Graveyard|debris field]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Yavin Prime/Legends|Yavin]], and that [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Prestor Organa]] was also alive within. In command of two [[Platoon/Legends|platoons]] of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], Bonn waited at [[Mining Outpost 11]] in the Alderaan system for the Heroes of Yavin to arrive, knowing that Lord Vader would follow. Bonn's goal was simple; when the Rebels arrived, he was to ensure that they did not leave until Vader arrived.<ref name=\"GoA\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|At long last, the hated Skywalker will be yours, as well as Princess Leia and the outlaw Han Solo.

He maintained a thick goatee beard, and was possessed of cold, dead eyes that intimidated his underlings. His stare, combined with his efficient and emotionless attitude, earned him the nickname of \"The Dead Man\" from his [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]]. His cold, unemotional behavior was a fa\u00e7ade, however;<ref name=\"GoA\" /> inside, Bonn was a seething pit of evil, fear, hatred and violence. When pressed, his composure would slip.
