However, Gel became worried that the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] would find Caeleb, so in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], he contacted the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and asked them to send [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], so that he could tell him about Caeleb.\n\nHowever, the spirit of the Sith consort [[Valik Kodank]] wanted Caeleb, so that her spirit could reside in his body. She tasked the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Thaum Rystra]] with capturing him and Rystra sent his apprentice [[Tol Skaros]] to capture the child. Skaros killed Caeleb's parents and kidnapped him, but before he could get far, he was attacked and defeated by some Rebel Alliance agents. They had been sent to Dalicron-4 to speak to Gel about Caeleb and they took him with them when they left the [[Planet/Legends|planet]].\n\nCaeleb lived in the care of the Alliance, but was kidnapped by Rystra eight months later. Rystra planned to use Caeleb to help him obtain the [[Soulsaber]], a dark side artifact, which was protected by the power of the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side of the Force]]. The Rebel Alliance team pursued Rystra and confronted him in the artifact's location, the [[Cavern of Light]], where he abandoned Caeleb to them and fled with the Soulsaber.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Child of Light]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Soulsaber (adventure)|''Soulsaber'']]\n*[[Light and Dark (adventure)|''Light and Dark'']] {{Mo}}\n\n[[Category:Dalicron-4 residents]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
