While at the cantina, Wunda unknowingly helped the bartender avoid the [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] loan shark [[Varak'Cha]] who, in turn, owed the Hutt a large amount of credits.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nWunda the Hutt was known for frequenting cantinas, and demanding a seemingly endless stream of foods and drinks. Wunda had little patience and a short temper, throwing fits of rage when not pleased.\n\n==Possessions==\nWunda possessed a customized [[Hoversled/Legends|hoversled]] designed to fit through the narrow corridors of traditional cantinas.\n\n==Guards==\nWunda was often escorted by his [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] bodyguards. [[Mogrugg]], one of Wunda's many guards, loyally served the Hutt for years.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Cantina]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
