At the time, Totryl was still quite new to the sport, and had only succeeded in posting a first-tier time on the local track.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the player chooses to engage in the optional swoop racing and sidequest based therein, Garm Totryl's time is the first that must be beaten in order to obtain [[race bond]]s from Motta.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Garm Totryl\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u0440\u043c \u0422\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Totryl, Garm}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
