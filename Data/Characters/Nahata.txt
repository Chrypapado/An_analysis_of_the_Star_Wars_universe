A confident and ruthless individual who was skilled with [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], he was a good pairing with [[Matu]] as their two skills, Matu's with blades and Nahata's with blasters, complemented each other well. Nahata went into the [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|fight]] against the Exile with confidence, but he overestimated his chances. Nahata was killed alongside Benok and Matu by [[Meetra Surik]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhen the player first meets Nahata, in the cantina, he is an [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]], but when the player next meets him in [[Loppak Slusk]]'s quarters, he appears as a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]]. He may have been a [[Changeling/Legends|changeling]], though this may have been a development oversight.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nahata\n|es=Nahata\n}}\n\n[[Category:Aqualish]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
