This drove a wedge between the married couple, who often argued over Palpatine's use of power. She, along with the Bel Iblis children, perished on [[Anchoron]] when a bomb meant for her husband detonated at the [[Treitamma Political Center]].\n\nIt was this deliberate act of assassination that drove Garm Bel Iblis into fully backing the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], and even becoming one of the Rebellion's more prominent leaders.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Interlude at Darkknell]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Force Unleashed]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{Imo}} {{1stm}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)|''Dark Force Rising'' audiobook]] {{Imo}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Force Unleashed Databank]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook|''Star Wars: Age of Rebellion'' Core Rulebook]] {{Imo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Arrianya Bel Iblis\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bel Iblis, Arrianya}}\n[[Category:Bureaucrats of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
