The [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] would often have the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] hovering nearby when he entertained guests. When Riboga left the [[Cularin system]], he sold off many of his possessions, IT-O9 included.\n\n[[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub Corporation]] eventually ended up with the droid, using it in their [[Edic Bar]] facilities. Having no need of an interrogation droid, they reprogrammed it as a quality control agent. Its reputation inspired workers, and though it communicated audibly only in beeps, the way it hovered menacingly was usually enough to communicate its unhappiness.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBy its name and description, IT-O9 would seem to be an [[IT-O Interrogator|IT-O]] type droid, which were supposed to have been invented by the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]]. Its service for Riboga was before [[53 BBY/Legends|53 BBY]], decades before the founding of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:SoroSuub Corporation employees]]\n[[Category:Torture droids]]"}}}]}}}}
