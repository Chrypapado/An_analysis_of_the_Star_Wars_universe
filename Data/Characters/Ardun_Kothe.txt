A Jedi Knight who couldn't live up to the Code. That Jedi can't live in a world of shadows&hellip;but maybe he can still save the galaxy.|Ardun Kothe|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Ardun Kothe''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who later became a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Spy/Legends|spy]] with the [[Republic Strategic Information Service]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] and the [[Galactic War]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] born to [[Edra Kothe|Edra]] and [[Neven Kothe]], he fled his homeworld of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] to the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] during the [[Great Galactic War]] when the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] invasion began. The [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] was able to identify his Force sensitivity when he was a young boy and recruited him into the Order, [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and ascending to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. Working with [[Refugee/Legends|refugees]] on [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] during his career, Kothe was a respected Knight and close with fellow Jedi [[Syo Bakarn]] and [[Jaric Kaedan]].<ref name=\"TORE\" />\n\nServing throughout the [[Great Galactic War]], Kothe was responsible for [[Assassination attempt on Falit and Thranz|rescuing]] the [[Senator/Legends|Senators]] [[Thranz]] and [[Falit]] from an attempt on their lives while on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. When the [[Treaty of Coruscant]] was signed in [[3653 BBY]], Kothe left the Jedi Order and joined the [[Republic Strategic Information Service]] as an [[Agent/Legends|agent]].<ref name=\"TORE\" /> Kothe rose swiftly in rank and was granted command of the [[Mid Rim Operations Group]] sixteen months after joining the SIS. There, he began a series of covert projects including [[Operation: Etching Wheel]], [[Operation: Derelict]] and [[Operation: Glass Knife]].<ref name=\"codeximpprof\" />\n\nAround [[3642 BBY]], Kothe was given special sanction by the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] to [[Strategic Information Service strike team|operate autonomously]] and to take any actions necessary to avert a disastrous second war with the Sith Empire. Kothe always believed in fate and redemption and the enemies from the Empire would be converted to the Republic side. He later encountered [[Cipher Nine]] who was serving undercover for the Empire. However, he didn't trust that the agent was sincere in defecting and used Nine's own brainwashing code. He and his team used the agent to gather various items for an unknown purpose, while the Agent secretly searched for a way to free themselves of the programming. During a mission on [[Quesh]], Kothe was going after the [[Shadow Arsenal]], an armament of undetectable nuclear missiles developed during the end of the previous war. His plan was to use the missiles as deterrent, believing that threatening [[Kaas City]] on [[Dromund Kaas]] would cow the Sith into surrendering. He ordered Nine to remain at the shield controls until the missiles were moved, and at which Nine would return to Imperial Intelligence for a few months. Shortly after, the chemicals took effect and the Agent's brainwashing program reset. The agent went in and engaged Kothe who revealed himself to be a former Jedi.<ref name=\"TORE\" />\n\n{{GameDS}}\n[[File:Ardun_battle.png|thumb|left|200px|Ardun Kothe makes his last stand before his demise]]\nAt the end of the battle, Nine trapped Kothe behind a force field and activated the security turrets. Kothe remembered the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] and was shot down by the turrets.<ref name=\"codeximpprof\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nArdun Kothe appeared to have a particular interest in subversion and recruitment of enemy assets. He wanted to believe his enemies could be converted into friends, but also maintained an awareness of the associated risks. He was instrumental in several slave rebellions: suggestive of strong political beliefs.<ref name=\"codeximpprof\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Ardun_Kothe_1.png|thumb|If spared on Quesh, Ardun Kothe approaches the agent again on Corellia]]\nIf the agent player choose light side option he/she can spare Kothe. If so, Kothe and his team will reunite with Cipher Nine on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] in place of [[Neyla Hawkins]]. Nine explains to him about the [[Star Cabal]] and Kothe agrees to help fake the agent's death. Near the end of Chapter 3, Kothe will kill the two Dark Council agents who arrived at the Star Cabal headquarters. He then requests the [[Black Codex]], promising to use it to destroy the Star Cabal before sealing the data. Nine can choose to either betray Kothe and kill him or refuse to hand over the Black Codex, so Kothe departs. If Nine did give the Black Codex to Kothe then he would ask Nine before departing if the agent wanted to join the Republic. Nine could either refuse or join the Republic (light side points).\n\nIf Nine spared Kothe and defected to the Republic, at the conclusion of battle against Revan at Yavin 4 the agent contacts Kothe to update him on the Empire's operations and happenings since their last contact.\n\nArdun Kothe is voiced by [[Dude Walker]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ardun Kothe\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kothe, Ardun}}\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Knights of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Kothe family]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Republic Strategic Information Service personnel]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
