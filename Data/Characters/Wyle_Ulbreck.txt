During a sixty year career as a [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]], Ulbreck became very wealthy and, by the time of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], operated a [[Ulbreck Compound|large ranch]] north of the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]] where he lived with his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]], [[Magda Ulbreck|Magda]]. More than twice the size of any other nearby [[Moisture farm/Legends|moisture farm]], Ulbreck's farm was staffed by numerous farmhands and guarded by private security personnel.\n\nConfident in his own security, Ulbrek was one of the few settlers in the region not to join the [[Settlers' Call Fund|Settlers' Call]], a group led by the moisture farmer [[Orrin Gault]] which provided mutual defense for its members against the frequent attacks by the native [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]]. By [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Gault was heavily in debt and began attacking his neighbors disguised as a Tusken Raider in the hopes of convincing them to join the Settlers' Call so that he could use the membership fees to pay off his debts. Ulbreck was among those targeted, but was able to escape the attack after the intervention of the self-[[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Although Gault attempted to frame the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] for the attacks, Kenobi was able to reveal the truth to Ulbreck and the other settlers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Moisture farmer===\n{{Quote|My people watch my place.

During a sixty [[Standard year/Legends|year]] career, Ulbreck saw it rain four times, only twice more than he claimed to have encountered a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]],<ref name=\"Kenobi\" /> a carnivorous [[Reptile/Legends|reptile]] native to Tatooine.<ref name=\"Krayt\">{{CSWECite|II|231|krayt dragon}}</ref>\n\nUlbreck spent most of his early career working alone, but in later years was able to hire farmhands and increasingly delegate work. By [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Ulbreck employed a small army of farmhands to work on the [[Ulbreck Compound|ranch]] he owned near the [[Pika Oasis/Legends|Pika Oasis]], north of the rocky region known as the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]]. Ulbreck's ranch was vast, more than twice the size of [[Gault moisture farm|that of his largest competitor]] in the region, [[Orrin Gault]]. At the center of the ranch was Ulbreck's home, a cluster of bubble-like buildings larger than many of the other homes in the desert. Ulbreck shared his home with his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]], [[Magda Ulbreck|Magda]], but the pair had no [[Youngling/Legends|children]]. One of the wealthiest farmers in that region, Ulbreck was well known for his frugal nature and famously kept most of his fortune in [[Aurodium/Legends|aurodium]]-plated ingots buried beneath his home's septic system.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nDue to his distrust of others, Ulbreck rarely visited the [[City/Legends|towns]] of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] and [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. For over twenty years prior to 19 BBY, he was, however, a regular customer at [[Dannar's Claim]], a store and [[Cantina/Legends|bar]] located at the Pika Oasis which was run by [[Annileen Calwell]] following the [[Death/Legends|death]] of her husband, [[Dannar Calwell|Dannar]], in an attack by the indigenous [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] in [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]]. The threat of the Tuskens led Orrin Gault to form the [[Settlers' Call Fund|Settlers' Call]], a fund into which many settlers in the region paid and which was used to provide weapons and vehicles for their mutual defense. Gault tried on several occasions to convince Ulbreck to subscribe to the Setters' Call Fund, but Ulbreck preferred to employ his own security personnel, operating out of barracks east of his house.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\n===Anchorhead incident===\n{{Quote|I don't care if Jabba the Hutt signs up. Wyle Ulbreck takes care of his own business!|Wyle Ulbreck refuses to join the Settlers' Call|Kenobi (novel)}}\n[[File:SWKenobi-coverart.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Ulbreck encountered Obi-Wan Kenobi shortly after his arrival on Tatooine.]]\nAt the conclusion of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in 19 BBY, the Galactic Republic was [[Declaration of a New Order|restructured]] into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] under the rule of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. The Republic's long-time guardians, the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], were accused of treason and virtually wiped out by Imperial forces, assisted by the former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], who had fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and become the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader.<ref name=\"NEC\" /> Shortly after the rise of the Empire, Ulbreck visited Anchorhead to meet with a vaporator parts [[Merchant/Legends|supplier]]. Having had a big fight with Magda that morning, Ulbreck was not eager to return home, so stopped at the [[Junix's Joint]] cantina and ended up falling asleep at the bar after several hours and half a dozen [[Lum/Legends|lum ales]]. When he finally awoke and stood up to leave, Ulbreck lost his balance and fell, but was caught and helped back to his stool by a [[Gender/Legends|man]] in a brown cloak. Unbeknownst to Ulbreck, his helper was the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], one of the few surviving Jedi, who had come to Tatooine to deliver Skywalker's infant son [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] safely out of reach of his father to his uncle and aunt, [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen]] and [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru Lars]].<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nWhile Kenobi was asking Ulbreck and the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] [[Junix's Joint bartender|bartender]] for directions, a fight broke out in the cantina between a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] customer, a group of [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] henchmen to the local [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]], [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], and a group of youths, comprising Orrin Gault's children, [[Mullen Gault|Mullen]] and [[Veeka Gault|Veeka]], Annileen Calwell's son, [[Jabe Calwell|Jabe]], and Gault's farmhand [[Zedd Grobbo]]. Ulbreck took cover, but Kenobi went to join the fray, leaving Skywalker with the bartender's wife, [[Yoona]], until a nearby [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shot caused her to panic and hand the baby over to Ulbreck as she ran to join her husband. Ulbreck watched as the Wookiee easily picked up Jabe Calwell and threw him towards a wall, only for Kenobi to use the Force to [[Telekinesis/Legends|redirect]] the young Human safely behind the bar. Kenobi used Calwell's blaster to shoot the light overhead, leaving the bar illuminated only by the blue glow of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's third lightsaber/Legends|Kenobi's lightsaber]]. By the time Kenobi collected Skywalker from Ulbreck moments later, the Rodians were dead and the shootout was over.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nUnable to explain Calwell's survival, the strange blue light or the fate of the Rodians, Ulbreck attributed what he had seen to [[Alcohol/Legends|alcohol]] and gave up drinking. A few [[Standard day/Legends|days]] later, he was traveling to Dannar's Claim in his dilapidated [[ST-101 Repulsortruck|ST-101 repulsortruck]] when the engine overheated, leaving him stuck in the desert. Concerned that somebody would steal his vehicle if he left it alone, Ulbreck contacted [[Gloamer]], the [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]] at Dannar's Claim, for assistance. It soon arrived in the form of Orrin Gault, who had offered to take some [[Coolant/Legends|coolant]] to Ulbreck. After Gault finished refilling the coolant in the ST-101, he attempted once more to sign Ulbreck up for the Settlers' Call Fund, citing a Tusken Raider attack on the [[Bezzard farm|Bezzard family's farm]] a few days earlier, which had been stopped by the arrival of armed Settlers' Call members. Ulbreck, however, was quick to point out that they had arrived too late to save [[Tyla Bezzard]]'s father, [[Lotho Pelhane]], and insisted that he had faith in his own security.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\n===Tusken attacks===\n{{Dialogue|Obi-Wan Kenobi|It's all right, Master Ulbreck.

Among the other customers was Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had settled in the area after leaving Skywalker with his aunt and uncle. Ulbreck almost recognized Kenobi from the Anchorhead incident, but quickly dismissed it and thereafter paid the other no mind. Kenobi eventually went outside with Annileen Calwell, leaving a sleeping Ulbreck and the Rodian [[Bohmer]] alone. Ulbreck woke to the sight of Tusken Raiders entering the store. Bohmer was caught by the attackers and seriously wounded, but Ulbreck wedged himself behind the store's weapons counter, and used the weapons there to keep the Tuskens at bay.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nThe settlers soon started to return and helped Calwell and Kenobi fight more Tuskens outside, but Ulbreck was in danger of being overwhelmed in the store. Help came when Kenobi entered, setting off a [[Fire extinguisher/Legends|fire extinguisher]] and using the resulting haze of chemical retardant as a cover while he attacked the Tuskens with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. When the haze cleared, over a dozen Tuskens lay dead. As Calwell activated the Settlers' Call and more settlers arrived, the surviving Tusken Raiders fled. Kenobi claimed that Ulbreck had been the one to kill the attackers while he provided a distraction; Ulbreck's recollection was unclear, but he was quick to take the credit and began telling the story to anybody who would listen. Orrin Gault organized a [[Comet Run Day Battle|retaliatory strike]] on the fleeing raiders, which resulted in the deaths of 48 Tuskens. Ulbreck, however, did not accompany them and was adamant that the incident proved the ineffectiveness of the Settlers' Call.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nSeveral days later, Ulbreck was once more in Dannar's Claim when he received a call informing him that Tusken Raiders had attacked one of his [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeders]], chasing away a security team and stealing both the landspeeder and the new vaporator it carried. As he headed home through Gault's land, Ulbreck encountered Gault and his children. Gault tried again to convince Ulbreck to join the Settlers' Call, suggesting that the Tusken Raiders had turned their attention to Ulbreck's land since the massacre the other day had driven them further away from the Pika Oasis. Ulbreck, however, was still unconvinced and once more declined. In response to the Tusken attack, he assigned more sentries to patrol vehicles.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nThe following evening, Ulbreck was smoking a [[Cigarra/Legends|cigarra]] on his porch when four Tusken Raiders approached the ranch. The Tuskens quickly incapacitated [[Langer]], a relative of Magda's who was on duty as night watch, and fired on Ulbreck, leaving him pinned down and unable to reach his [[Blaster rifle/Legends|rifle]]. Ulbreck shouted a warning to his wife inside the house, but the attackers kicked in the side door and threw a [[smoke grenade]] inside. Magda stumbled outside and was grabbed by one of the attackers. When Ulbreck attempted to reach his wife, one of the Tuskens struck him with the butt of a blaster rifle, breaking his [[Nose/Legends|nose]] and sending him crashing to the deck. The attackers dragged Magda in front of Ulbreck and the leader approached her with a [[Knife/Legends|knife]]. At that moment, Kenobi jumped down from the roof, knocking the knife from the lead Tusken's hands. As the others released Magda to fight the new arrival, she and Ulbreck reached the nearby garage and fled in Ulbreck's [[Speeder truck/Legends|repulsortruck]].<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nBy the time Ulbreck's security staff secured the ranch, both Kenobi and the Tusken Raiders had gone. However, a [[Scout/Legends|scout]] saw the Tusken Raider [[A'Yark/Legends|Plug-eye]], who had led the attack on Dannar's Claim days earlier, leaving the area and Ulbreck assumed that she was also behind the attack on his ranch. Early the next morning, Ulbreck went to see Gault and declared his intention to join the Settlers' Call Fund. Gault quickly gathered the settlers and Ulbreck's security personnel at Dannar's Claim. Ulbreck's memory was unclear on what role Kenobi had played, but he was able to confirm that the newcomer had been present during the attack and Gault seized on this to denounce Kenobi as a traitor who had directed the Tusken Raiders to Ulbreck's, knowing that it was not protected by the Settlers' Call.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\n===Showdown with Kenobi===\n{{Quote|I killed me a room full of Tuskens. I ain't gonna let you people push me around!|Wyle Ulbreck confronts Mosep Binneed|Kenobi (novel)}}\nThe posse set out to catch Kenobi at his [[Ben Kenobi's hut|home]] on the outskirts of the Jundland Wastes. Spotting him leaving on a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]], they followed as Kenobi took shelter in the [[Roiya Rift]], a rocky labyrinth where the local Tusken Raiders were known to hide. The settlers waited outside the rift to prevent Kenobi's escape, but before they could deploy smoke charges to flush him out, a stampede of [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] emerged from the Rift and charged toward them. Ulbreck and the others took cover as the banthas charged straight into their vehicles, overturning several. Moments later, a speeder bike emerged from the rift. Thinking Kenobi was attempting to escape, the vigilantes opened fire, but when the speeder bike crashed, they discovered that what had appeared to be the driver was only a [[duffel]] stuffed with Tusken clothing. As the settlers gathered around the downed speeder bike, they heard Kenobi's voice, [[Telepathy/Legends|projected]] by the Force, reveal that he had found the clothing at Gault's ranch. Gault, he explained, had been using the Settlers' Call Fund to pay off his debts to the [[Bank/Legends|banks]] and Jabba the Hutt; when membership had started to decrease, Gault and his children had taken to attacking his neighbors, disguised as Tuskens, in an effort to scare them into joining the Fund.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nUlbreck was angry to learn that Gault had been behind the attack on his ranch. He and the other settlers confronted the Gaults, but were interrupted by the arrival of a [[Skiff/Legends|skiff]] carrying the [[Nimbanel/Legends|Nimbanel]] [[Mosep Binneed/Legends|Mosep Binneed]] and several of Jabba the Hutt's minions, intent on recovering the money Gault owed to the Hutt crime lord. When Annileen Calwell also arrived moments later, she confirmed what Kenobi had told the settlers and revealed that she had told Binneed where to find Gault. Veeka Gault angrily grabbed Calwell's arm, prompting Ulbreck and the other settlers to turn their weapons on the Gaults. Bineed insisted that Gault be turned over to him, but Ulbreck refused to be bullied and fired on Binneed's skiff, killing the [[Klatooinian/Legends|Klatooinian]] gunner [[Jorrk]]. The other settlers followed Ulbreck's lead and a firefight broke out between the settlers and the criminals.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nThe Gaults used the distraction to flee into the rift, taking Calwell with them. Their escape was short-lived, however, as Kenobi and the Tuskens had formed a truce to stop the Gaults. Outside the rift, the brief fight ended with Binneed deciding to cut his losses and ordering a withdrawal. As the settlers celebrated their victory, an injured Veeka Gault fled the Rift, followed shortly by Calwell. Ulbreck was relieved to see that Calwell was unhurt, but disappointed to learn that he would not get to confront Orrin and Mullen Gault, neither of whom had survived.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You cussed things couldn't kill me at the Claim! I won't beg now!|Wyle Ulbreck, defiant while under attack on his ranch|Kenobi (novel)}}\nHaving worked hard from a young age, Wyle Ulbreck became a successful moisture farmer, owning a ranch significantly larger than any other in the region. His success made him wealthy, but Ulbreck was notoriously frugal, spending as little as possible and burying the majority of his fortune beneath his home's septic system. Ulbreck was not fond of other beings, even those who worked for him, who he believed would steal from him if he left them alone for too long. His attitude was often reciprocated by others and even his own staff did not like to spend time with him. He was particularly distrustful of city dwellers and droids, who he refused to do business with in the belief that they were programmed to steal for their [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] masters. In addition to Jawas, he had a low opinion of the Sand People, who he did not consider capable of logical thought. Although he cared for his wife, Ulbreck and Magda frequently argued. Ulbreck would seek peace from his wife by spending most days at Dannar's Claim, although Annileen Calwell suspected that this was to Magda's benefit as much as Ulbreck's. At night, Ulbreck would seek refuge outside his home, allowing him to smoke [[Cigarra/Legends|cigarras]], despite being forbidden by both his wife and his [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]]. As well as cigarras, Ulbreck was partial to alcohol, although he quit drinking after witnessing Obi-Wan Kenobi defeat some of Jabba the Hutt's minions in Anchorhead, believing that he had imagined the whole thing as a result of intoxication.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nUlbreck prided himself on knowing his way around Tatooine, although there were few places on the planet he liked. His long life on the planet had left him with numerous stories and theories which he liked to share with others whenever he got the chance. As Dannar's Claim's best customer, he spent twenty years regaling Annileen Calwell and her regular customers with the same stories, ranging from the four times he had seen it rain on the desert planet to his encounters with krayt dragons. One visitor described Ulbreck's tales as transcendental loops which defied the laws of physics and storytelling. When Kenobi rescued Ulbreck from the Sand People attack on Dannar's Claim, Ulbreck was quick to accept Kenobi's explanation that the elderly farmer had killed the attackers. He soon started telling the story to anybody who would listen, filling in the blanks with his imagination.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nUlbreck viewed the Settlers' Call with derision and frequently rejected Gault's attempts to enlist him. He had no interest in protecting those around him and believed that his own security personnel were sufficient to protect his own lands. As owner of the largest ranch in the area, Ulbreck would have been required to pay a higher membership fee than his peers, which he objected to out of principle and believed would have been squandered by Gault and the other members. Ulbreck refused to be pushed around by anybody; he remained defiant even when Gault threatened Magda during the attack on Ulbreck's farm and opted to fire on Jabba the Hutt's thugs rather than allow them to take Gault during the showdown at the Roiya Rift. When he learned that Gault had been killed, he was frustrated that he would not get to see the man brought to justice.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\nBy the time of the Galactic Empire, Ulbreck was elderly and balding with [[Color/Legends|white]] facial year and a gravelly voice. He was in good shape for his age, but no longer performed manual labor, instead delegating to his numerous farmhands.<ref name=\"Kenobi\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWyle Ulbreck was created by [[John Jackson Miller]] for the [[2013]] novel [[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']]. ''Kenobi'' was originally envisioned as a [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] and early drafts of the story did not include Ulbreck, who was only added after [[Random House]] picked up the story as a novel. Random House suggested adding a prologue that included Obi-Wan Kenobi, who otherwise would not appear until much later in the book. Miller used Ulbreck as an unreliable narrator for the prologue, his drunken state allowing him to witness Kenobi using the Force to deal with a bar fight without understanding what had occurred.<ref name=\"JJM\">{{Faraway|fiction/books/swkenobi.html|Star Wars: Kenobi|archivedate=20200520022007}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']] {{1st|[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/the-world-of-star-wars-kenobi|text=The World of ''Star Wars: Kenobi''}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ulbreck, Wyle}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
