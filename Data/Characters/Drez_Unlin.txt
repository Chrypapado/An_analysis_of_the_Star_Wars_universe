At some point during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], he captured the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]] and made him his hostage, until [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]] came to their colleague's rescue. Unlin promised to release Koon if one of the two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] could beat him on a race, but he broke his promise after Tano did so. Unlin was ultimately neutralized by his own [[electroshock net]] during a fight with the Jedi. Once Plo Koon was freed, Unlin got transferred to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], where he would spend the rest of the war in [[Prison/Legends|prison]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Drop your weapon, Jedi, or your ''Padawan'' will be ''history''.|Unlin, to Skywalker|The Masked Racer}}\n[[File:Cocky_Unlin.png|thumb|left|Unlin and Tano ready to compete]]\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Felucian/Legends|Felucian]], Drez Unlin lived during the waning [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Around [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], he was a professional [[Podracer (profession)/Legends|Podracer]] in the [[Dustig sector/Legends|Dustig sector]] and resided on [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]]. At some point after the [[Battle of Teth/Legends|Battle of Teth]], Unlin had business with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. One [[Standard day/Legends|day]], the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]] stopped on Malastare to refuel while on his way back to the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], and he spotted Unlin talking to a well-known Separatist [[General/Legends|general]]. When the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] tried to enter Unlin's [[Tent/Legends|tent]], the Podracer dropped an [[electroshock net]], rendering the intruder unconscious. Unlin was now in the possession of a precious hostage, and he soon received the visit of the [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]]. Suspecting the Podracer was holding his colleague hostage, Skywalker challenged Unlin to a race: if the Jedi won, Koon would be released, while if Unlin won, both Skywalker and Tano would become his prisoners. Unlin, however, deemed Skywalker too tall to fit in a [[Podracer/Legends|Podracer]], which is why the Tano was chosen to race in her master's stead. During the race, which consisted of a single lap, Unlin tried to sabotage Tano's Podracer, but the Padawan countered his treachery by using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Despite the young woman's victory, Unlin refused to hand over Koon, and he sicced a group of four [[B1-Series battle droid]]s on the Jedi. The two warriors disposed of the droids quickly, and Unlin approached Tano behind her back, disarming her and placing her in the threat of his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. However, the Jedi acted quickly: while Tano pushed her opponent under the tent's electroshock net, Skywalker pushed the button that made it fall, thus neutralizing Unlin. Master Plo Koon was freed and the Podracer was subsequently brought to Coruscant and put in jail. While Unlin claimed that [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], leader of the Confederacy, would come and free him eventually, Skywalker pointed out how unlikely that was given the Podracer's failure.<ref name=\"TMR\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Looks like I've ''won'' this race...|Unlin|The Masked Racer}}\nUnlin was an orange-skinned Felucian.<ref name=\"TMR\" /> He stood somewhere between 1.61 and 1.88 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]].<ref name=\"Height\" /> According to Anakin Skywalker, Unlin's main weakness was his overconfidence. He was also notedly materialistic, as he immediately inquired about his possessions upon being arrested. He had a hypocritical view of cheating, as he considered his own deceptions as fair game but would not tolerate a Jedi using the Force to counter them.<ref name=\"TMR\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|One ''down''...
