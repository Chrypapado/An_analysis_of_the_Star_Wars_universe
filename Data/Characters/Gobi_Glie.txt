Let's force-feed these Imperials some fire.|Gobi, moments before the attack on the ''[[Perilous]]''|Lords of the Sith}}\n'''Gobi Glie''' was a [[Rutian]] [[Twi'lek]] [[Gender|male]] who lived on [[Ryloth]]. During the [[Clone Wars]], he was part of the [[Twi'lek Resistance]] that opposed the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]]'s [[Battle of Ryloth|occupation]] of the [[planet]]. After the rise of the [[Galactic Empire]], Glie joined [[Cham Syndulla]]'s [[Free Ryloth Movement]].\n\nGlie was a close friend of Syndulla and his [[Syndulla clan|family]], and treated his daughter, [[Hera Syndulla]], like a niece.<ref name=\"Gobi Glie databank\">{{Databank|gobi-glie|Gobi Glie|archivedate=20210712150404}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===The Clone Wars===\n{{Quote|Cham is still angry, he feels betrayed|Gobi|Supply Lines}}\n[[File:GobiGlie-SL.png|thumb|Gobi, during the Clone Wars|left]]\nWhen the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] [[Battle of Ryloth|invaded]] [[Ryloth]] during the [[Clone Wars]], Gobi joined the [[Twi'lek Resistance]] under General [[Cham Syndulla]]. He then fought with the Resistance along side the Republic garrison under [[Jedi]] [[Jedi General|General]] [[Ima-Gun Di]]. Unfortunately, supplies started to run low and the [[Separatist Droid Army|Droid Army]] was overwhelming them. When Di told Syndulla that his men would hold off the droids while the Resistance and their families fled to the mountains, Gobi spoke with Di. Gobi told him how Syndulla felt betrayed by the Republic, but Di told him that his men would get their families to safety. Gobi promised Di that they would remember his sacrifice. As Gobi and the others made their escape, they then received supplies from [[Pelta-class frigate|''Pelta''-class frigates]] under Alderaan Republic Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]].<ref name=\"SL\">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref>\n\nGobi continue to fight under Syndulla. He then got a scratch that weakened him, but Cham assured that he would get better. He and the other Resistance fighters then cheered when Syndulla decided to join Windu's forces and free Ryloth's capital of [[Lessu]] from the Confederacy.<ref name=\"liberty\" />\n\n===Age of the Empire===\nAfter the end of the Clone Wars and the transformation of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]], Gobi became worried for the safety of Ryloth, believing the Empire posed a dangerous threat to the people. When all Twi'leks were ordered to hand over their weapons, Gobi secretly bought more from his underworld contact, [[Cid]]. Gobi would be arrested by the Empire for this, but would be rescued by Syndulla.\n\nGobi would continue to fight under Syndulla when the Resistance was reorganized into the [[Free Ryloth Movement]]. He, Syndulla and the movement attacked the ''[[Perilous]]'', attempting to assassinate [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. Though the ''Perilous'' was destroyed, the Free Ryloth movement failed in their assassination of the Emperor and the Sith Lord.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\n====Aiding the Spectres====\n[[File:Ryloth_rebels.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gobi (far left), Cham, and Numa joined forces with the Spectres]]\nThree years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Gobi was still considered one of Syndulla's best soldiers. By then, the Free Ryloth movement was engaged in a struggle against the Galactic Empire, which had succeeded the Old Republic and was refusing to leave Ryloth. He along with Cham and [[Numa]] later rendezvoused with Syndulla's daughter Captain [[Hera Syndulla|Hera]], who had become the leader of a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] that operated from the starship ''[[Ghost]]''. Hera had established contact with her estranged father Cham because she needed his help to hijack an Imperial [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier]] orbiting [[Ryloth]]. Since the cruiser-carrier housed [[TIE/sa bomber]]s that regularly bombarded Ryloth's surface, Cham advocated destroying the ship.<ref name=\"Homecoming\">{{Rebels|Homecoming}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Hera disagreed with her father's plan and advocated stealing the cruiser-carrier for the rebellion. After a heated discussion, Cham reluctantly conceded to Hera's plan. In secret, Cham still intended to destroy the Imperial cruiser-carrier and instructed Numa and Gobi to bring a bag of [[detonator]]s. During the journey to Ryloth, Gobi and his Twi'lek companions pretended to befriend the rebels in order to gain their trust. After landing a stolen TIE bomber in the Imperial cruiser carrier, the Ryloth rebels put their plan into action. Under Cham's orders, Gobi and Numa stunned Hera's rebel comrades [[Ezra Bridger]], [[Sabine Wren]], [[Kanan Jarrus]], and [[Garazeb Orrelios]] while Cham dealt with Hera and her [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]].<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nAfter exiting their TIE bomber, the three Twi'leks defeated a squad of [[stormtrooper]]s that had been sent to the hangar bay. While Cham proceeded to disable the ship's [[hyperdrive]], Gobi and Numa made their way to the munitions rack. Shortly later, they were caught up in a gun battle with more stormtroopers. Two of the Spectres, Sabine and Zeb, managed to overpower Gobi and Numa by using a rigged [[MSE-6 series repair droid|mouse droid]] to [[stun]] them. The two rebels then secured their Twi'lek prisoners while the other four Spectres convinced Cham to abandon his plan to destroy the Imperial cruiser-carrier.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nWhile Hera reasoned with her father, Sabine played the recording to Gobi and Numa in an effort to convince them to join forces. In the end, Cham agreed to work with the Spectres and Gobi and Numa appeared to accept his decision. After several Imperial reinforcements and TIE bombers attempted to reclaim the cruiser-carrier, Gobi and Numa joined forces with Sabine and Zeb in repelling the Imperial forces. In the end, the two rebel cells managed to escape the Ryloth system with their stolen ship. While leaving, they destroyed an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]], which boosted the morale of the Ryloth rebels and the Twi'leks. Having established a working relationship with the rebellion and neutralized the threat posed by the Empire, Gobi and his comrades depart on their shuttle back to Ryloth.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\n====Recovering the Kalikori====\nTwo years before the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], the Free Ryloth movement faced a formidable new opponent in the form of [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]]. Studying Twi'lek culture, philosophy, history, and art, Thrawn devised successful counterinsurgency techniques which led to the capture of [[Tann Province]], the home of the [[Syndulla clan]]. Gobi was aboard the ''Ghost'' when Cham's daughter Hera undertook a supply run for the Free Ryloth rebels. After the ''Ghost'' drove off the Imperial pursuers and picked up Cham and Numa, Gobi and all the other rebels volunteered to assist Hera recover her [[Eleni Syndulla|mother's]] [[Kalikori]] heirloom from the Empire, who were occupying the [[Syndulla residence]].<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\">{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the recovery mission, Gobi and the other rebels staged a diversionary attack on Imperial forces in the [[Tulara Ravine]] while Hera, Ezra, and Chopper infiltrated the Syndulla residence. During the skirmish, Gobi along with Cham and Numa charged into the fray on their [[blurrg]] steeds after Sabine blew up an [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transport]] and an [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walker]]. The two rebel cells then fled into the wilderness but were unable to outrun a second AT-DP walker. Gobi tried to delay the walker by collapsing rocks in its path but the walker blasted through it easily.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nFollowing a prolonged gun battle, the AT-DP stopped fighting to broadcast a message by Thrawn's second in command, [[Captain]] [[Slavin]]. Slavin offered to spare the lives of Hera and Ezra if Cham surrendered himself to the Empire. Cham accepted due to his love for Hera. Whenever Gobi advised him against it, Cham designated Hera as his successor. However, Hera staged a successful escape plan which involved getting Chopper to plant explosives. During the exchange, Hera ignited the explosives. This allowed the two rebel cells to escape with all their personnel. Gobi and Numa later mingled with Hera's crew while Hera and Kanan chatted with Cham.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGobi Glie is voiced by [[Corey Burton]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Bad Batch]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Supply Lines}}\n*{{TCW|Liberty on Ryloth}} {{1st}}\n*{{TBB|Devil's Deal}}\n*{{TBB|Rescue on Ryloth}}\n*''[[Lords of the Sith]]''\n*[[Lords of the Sith (audiobook)|''Lords of the Sith'' audiobook]]\n*{{Rebels|Homecoming}}\n*{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Armada|Hammerhead Corvettes Expansion Pack|cardname=Cham Syndulla|link=https://starwars-armada.fandom.com/wiki/Cham_Syndulla}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: On the Front Lines]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*{{Armada|Upgrade Card Collection|''Upgrade Card Collection''|cardname=Cham Syndulla|link=https://starwars-armada.fandom.com/wiki/Cham_Syndulla}} {{Po}}\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Blasters and Firearms}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{SW|url=series/the-bad-batch/devils-deal-episode-guide|text=Devil's Deal Episode Guide}}\n*{{SW|url=series/the-bad-batch/rescue-on-ryloth|text=Rescue on Ryloth Episode Guide}}\n*{{Databank|gobi-glie|Gobi Glie|archivedate=20210712150404}}\n*{{Databank|gobi-glie-s-starship|Gobi Glie's Starship|archivedate=20210712141758}}\n*{{Databank|numa|Numa|archivedate=20200220152650}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Gobi Glie\n|fr=Gobi Glie\n|ja=\u30b4\u30d3\u30fb\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\n|ka=\u10d2\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d2\u10da\u10d8\n|pl=Gobi Glie\n|ru=\u0413\u043e\u0431\u0438 \u0413\u043b\u0438/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n|tr=Gobi Glie\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glie, Gobi}}\n[[Category:Free Ryloth movement members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rutian Twi'leks]]\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]"}}}]}}}}
