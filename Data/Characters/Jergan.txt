Inside the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], Jergan spent his [[Time/Legends|time]] looking for women. Asking about their thoughts on the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina's]] [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] [[Band/Legends|band]], he then offered the ladies a backstage visit for a fee of twenty [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], which he ran off with. In [[3956 BBY]], he succeeded in this scheme with at least one woman, [[Lana]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Surely you understand what I'm talking about. I'd guess you've experienced many lonely evenings&hellip;something I'm hoping to avoid tonight.|Jergan, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nJergan was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Con artist/Legends|con artist]] who frequented the [[Upper City Cantina]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]], looking for women in order to trick them out of their [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. When he found a suitable target for his scheme, he approached her, asking what she thought about the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina's]] [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] [[Band/Legends|band]]. Regardless of the female's opinion, he would then offer to take her backstage to meet the band after the show, claiming that he had an agreement with a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] who could arrange the meeting for a fee of twenty credits. In fact, nobody backstage knew Jergan. After receiving the money that he promised to deliver to the Rodian, Jergan ran away with it and did not return.<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> In [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"CG\">The events of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' are dated to [[3956 BBY]] by the ''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''.</ref> a woman named [[Lana]] fell for Jergan's lies and was conned out of her twenty credits. Lana subsequently began searching for Jergan in order to reclaim her money with interest. Jergan was aware of that fact, though he continued with his business in the cantina.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nA [[Standard week/Legends|week]] after he conned Lana, Jergan met the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] in the cantina. When Revan tried to strike up a conversation, however, Jergan replied that he did not have the time to talk at the moment, stating that he was looking to find a female companion for the evening.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nHoping to obtain a small sum of money, Jergan resorted to lies in order to trick unsuspecting women.

I see from your exotic appearance that you are not from Taris originally. Allow me to introduce myself&mdash;my name is Jergan.|Jergan, in a non-canon conversation with a female Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nJergan first appeared as an NPC in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', wherein the player, Revan, has an option to interact with him in the Upper City Cantina. In the game, Revan's gender is customizable; however, Jergan will refuse to talk to the<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> [[canon]]ical male character.<ref name=\"CG\" /> Should the player take a non-canonical path and play as a female Revan, Jergan's scamming business is revealed, as he tries to approach the player, offering to take her backstage. If the player agrees and gives him twenty credits, he runs away with the money, promising to arrange the meeting. Revan then meets Lana, who reveals that Jergan is a con artist who has recently used the same scheme to rob her of twenty credits. Lana also believes that Jergan will not come back to the cantina, as he knows that she is looking for him.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jergan\n|es=Jergan\n|pl=Jergan\n|fi=Jergan\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
