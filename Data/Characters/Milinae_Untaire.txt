Milinae was the identical twin sister of [[Trilinae Untaire]], who, unlike Milinae, was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and joined the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Milinae went on a mission with Trilinae and the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Darrus Jeht/Legends|Darrus Jeht]] to learn the identity of the mysterious [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[R]]. They landed on his [[Space station/Legends|space station]] in the [[Cularin system]] and infiltrated the facility, but were unsuccessful at learning much about him. R had Milinae's [[Starship/Legends|starship]] destroyed, and the trio were forced to steal a [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] in order to escape. Later during the conflict, in about [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Trilinae went missing and Milinae sent a transmission to Jeht, to enlist his help with finding her sister. She also informed him that the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy]] situated on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]] in the Cularin [[Star system/Legends|system]], had recently been [[Destruction of the Almas Academy|destroyed]], a fact that disturbed him greatly. Untaire boarded Jeht's [[Warship/Legends|warship]], the [[Maelstrom (warship)|''Maelstrom'']] and Jeht had it immediately depart for the Cularin system. However, on arrival there, the vessel became engaged in [[Second battle of Cularin|a battle]] with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ship]] ''[[Shadowblade]]'', and Jeht ordered Untaire and the droid [[R-0]] to flee to safety aboard his personal vessel, the [[Legacy (Darrus Jeht)|''Legacy'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20041216|text=Standoffs|int=Standoffs|archivedate=20090603045521}} {{1st}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20060216DarkShadows|text=Living Force: Dark Shadows|int=Living Force: Dark Shadows|archivedate=20090603045518}} {{1stID}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20070201LastStand|text=Living Force: Last Stand|int=Living Force: Last Stand|archivedate=20091016011748}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Untaire, Milinae}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
