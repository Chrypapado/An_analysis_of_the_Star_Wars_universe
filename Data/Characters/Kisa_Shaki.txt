She and six other thugs then attempted to seize a portion of Jabba's [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] business, but found themselves faced with formidable competition in the person of [[Qes Dollis]], the manager of the [[Sandstorm Shipping Concern]].\n\nThe gang war that resulted drew the attention of the local [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance]] cell and Rebel agents attempted to resolve the situation. However, Kisa was confident in her abilities and merely threatened or attempted to suborn the operatives.\n\n==Personality==\nKisa was deeply ambitious, making it clear to the Rebels that she did not aim simply for a portion of the smuggling pie, but also fancied herself a future [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] in the mold of [[Xim/Legends|Xim]] the Despot.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAs with her rival, Kisa failed to gain control of Mos Eisley smuggling. ''Secrets of Tatooine'' reports that most of the smugglers ended up affiliated with [[Talon Karrde]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shaki, Kisa}}\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
