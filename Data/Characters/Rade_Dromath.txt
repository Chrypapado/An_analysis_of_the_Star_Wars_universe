His mother always planned for an invasion of Garqi by the [[Imperial Remnant]], and so formulated escape and resistance plans and made secret stockpiles of supplies.\n\nAlthough his mother was killed when the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] first invaded Garqi, Rade escaped and used her preparations to become a leading member of the [[Resistance (Garqi)|Garqi Resistance]], later helping a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] commando unit during the [[Battle of Garqi]]. Along with the rest of the Resistance, he chose to remain behind to fight the Vong on their homeworld than to accompany the New Republic team offworld.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rade Dromath\n|es=Rade Dromath\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dromath, Rade}}\n[[Category:Garqi residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
