In the last [[Standard day|days]] of the conflict, Pryde was appointed as the [[commanding officer]] of the [[Final Order]]&mdash;a [[fleet]] of [[Xyston-class Star Destroyer|''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers]]&mdash;by the [[Cloning|reborn]] [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious]]. Occupying a position of power and privilege, Pryde was a high-ranking [[First Order officer]] who wielded authority over the [[First Order Army|ground]] and [[First Order Navy|naval]] forces of the [[First Order military]]. Pryde's [[flagship]], the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Steadfast (Resurgent-class)|''Steadfast'']], was named in honor of the [[Steadfast (Imperial-class Star Destroyer)|vessel]] he commanded during his [[time]] in the [[Imperial Navy]].\n\nA [[Homeworld|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Alsakan]], Pryde was raised under the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. As such, his ideology was shaped by the principles of the [[New Order]]. A veteran of the [[Imperial Military]], he retreated into the [[Unknown Regions]] of [[the galaxy]] after the Empire [[Battle of Jakku|fell]] to the [[New Republic Defense Force|forces]] of the [[New Republic]]. Like other [[Imperial officer]]s, Pryde joined the Empire's successor [[Politics|state]], the First Order, longing to return to the [[High Human]] culture and civilization of his youth. During the [[New Republic Era]], he served as part of a second wave of [[First Order High Command|leadership]] that [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]] kept in reserve after the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|unveiling]] of [[Starkiller Base]]. After Snoke's [[death]], Supreme Leader [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]] supported Pryde's career at the expense of his rival, [[General]] [[Armitage Hux]].\n\nWhile the [[The Force|mysticism]] of Snoke and Ren were foreign to him, as were the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] rituals of [[Sith cultist]]s, Pryde was interested in the material benefits they offered to the military. As a member of the [[Supreme Council]], he supported Ren's alliance with the [[Sith Eternal]] [[Religion|cult]] and personally [[Mission to Kijimi|executed]] Hux for committing the [[treason]] of [[Spy|espionage]] against the First Order. When Ren's [[Mission to Kef Bir|mission]] to [[Kef Bir]] ended with his [[Light side of the Force|redemption]], Pryde assumed command in the absence of a Supreme Leader. Having served the Emperor in the [[Galactic Civil War]], Pryde swore his allegiance to the Emperor and was given command of the Sith fleet, comprising thousands of Sith [[Star Destroyer]]s, fitted with [[axial superlaser]] [[cannon]]s that were capable of [[Superweapon|obliterating]] entire planets. Pryde, however, perished when his [[command ship]] was destroyed by [[Resistance]] forces during the [[Battle of Exegol]]. Without the ''Steadfast'', the [[Sith]] [[warship]]s were unable to leave [[Exegol]], resulting in the Sith fleet's destruction by the [[Resistance navy]] and their [[Citizens' Fleet|allies]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nEnric Pryde was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Alsakan]]<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" /> in [[27 BBY]].<ref name=\"Age\" /> By [[11 BBY]],<ref name=\"Alsakan date\">The ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'' states that Pryde was given advanced placement in the [[Alsakan Academy]] 45 [[Standard year|years]] before the \"[[Hosnian Cataclysm|Starkiller Incident]].\" As ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the Starkiller Incident to [[34 ABY]], it can be deduced that Pryde joined the academy by 11 [[Galactic standard calendar|BBY]].</ref>  Pryde had achieved advanced placement in the [[Alsakan Academy]].<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" />\n\n===Under the Empire===\nDuring the [[Imperial Era]], Enric Pryde served in the [[Imperial Navy]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].

Pryde was left as one of the most senior officers in the First Order High Command and commanded reserve forces. While rebuilding his command, Kylo Ren discovered the reserve forces under Pryde's leadership and brought Pryde to the fore, eventually making him a member of the [[Supreme Council]] he formed and promoted him to [[Allegiant General]]. Pryde knew far more about the machinations of Supreme Leader Snoke and the late [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious]] than his cohorts, which he used towards his advantage to cement his power.<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" />\n\nIn the [[35 ABY|year]] after the [[Battle of Crait]], a [[Palpatine's broadcast|mysterious broadcast]] with the voice of the late Emperor Palpatine swept out across the galaxy. Deeming the Emperor's return as a potential threat to his rule, Ren diverted his attention from the [[Resistance]] and sought ways to track down the Emperor's whereabouts. The Supreme Leader became aware that he required a [[Sith wayfinder]] to do so, leading Ren to go, accompanied by Pryde and Hux, to the [[Volcano|volcanic]] planet of [[Mustafar]], once ruled by Vader from his personal stronghold, [[Fortress Vader]]. Upon arriving there, Ren and a stormtrooper squad [[Mission to Mustafar (First Order)|engaged in a fight]] with the [[Alazmec of Winsit]], a tenacious sect of [[Sith cultist]]s devoted to protecting [[Corvax Fen]] and who venerated Vader as a [[deity]] of the dark side, while Pryde and Hux watched from a safe distance. As the fight ensued, Pryde asked Hux if he didn't like to see Ren fighting. When Hux expressed his opinion that Ren had gone mad due prioritizing a ghost's chase over the burning rebellion flames across the galaxy, Pryde reminded Hux that there was someone behind the message and that Ren would answer to no one.<ref name=\"TROS Expanded\">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>\n\nRen eventually made his way to Fortress Vader and recovered [[Vader's wayfinder]], which he used to track down the Emperor. After discovering the returned Emperor Palpatine, his cult, the [[Sith Eternal]] and their built up forces on [[Exegol]], and learning that there was a [[spy]] within the First Order who had sent a message to the Resistance, Kylo Ren presented the head of [[Boolio]] before Pryde and the rest of the Supreme Council and informed them of his findings during a meeting on the ''Steadfast''. General [[Domaric Quinn]] expressed skepticism of the cult, dismissing them as soothsayers and conjurers, but Pryde supported the First Order's alliance with the Sith Eternal, noting that the [[Final Order]] would increase their resources ten thousandfold before snidely remarking that it would \"correct the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|error]]\" of Starkiller Base while glaring at General Hux.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n[[File:Kandia Ren Pryde.png|250px|thumb|left|Learning of a Resistance mission on Pasaana, Ren ordered Pryde to prepare to attack.]]\nAfter discovering that the Resistance was operating on [[Pasaana]], Kylo Ren ordered Allegiant General Pryde to prepare his ship and notify their local forces on Pasaana of the Resistance's presence. General Hux later discussed the [[Mission to Pasaana (Resistance)|mission to Pasaana]] with Allegiant General Pryde, noting that the First Order had experienced considerable losses under the command of the [[Knights of Ren]]. Hux presented their captured prisoner, [[Chewbacca]], to Pryde, who ordered he be locked up in the detention block. After the Resistance's [[Mission to Kijimi|mission]] to [[Kijimi]], during which time Hux had helped [[Poe Dameron]] and [[Finn]] return to ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and escape the ''Steadfast'', Hux reported to Pryde that the Resistance fighters had forced him to help them escape. However, Pryde saw through Hux's lie and, having realized that Hux was the spy, executed him on the spot before having the Supreme Leader informed of Hux's [[treason]]. Pryde also told Ren that the Sith dagger, upon which there was an inscription of the location of one of the [[Sith wayfinder]]s, now in the Resistance's possession, had been scanned during the captivity of the Wookiee, allowing for Ren to track Rey to [[Kef Bir]], where the [[Padawan|Jedi aspirant]] hoped to [[Mission to Kef Bir|uncover]] a Sith [[wayfinder]] that would lead to the Emperor.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n===Leading the First Order===\n====Destruction of Kijimi====\n{{Quote|Send a ship to a world they know.

Sometime later, Emperor Palpatine discussed this turn of events with Allegiant General Pryde over a [[hologram]]. The Emperor ordered the Allegiant General to come to him on [[Exegol]], and Pryde pledged himself to Emperor Palpatine, reminding the [[Sith Lord]] that he had served him during the<ref name=\"Episode IX\" /> Old Wars,<ref name=\"TROS Expanded\" /> and now would do so again.

Switch out the source of the navigation signal to this ship. We will guide the fleet out ourselves.|A First Order officer and Enric Pryde, during the battle at Exegol|Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker}}\nAllegiant General Pryde arrived on Exegol sometime before the [[Battle of Exegol]], where the ''Steadfast'' acted as the [[command ship]] of the Sith fleet. A Resistance attack soon launched, hoping to prevent the Sith Star Destroyers from sowing chaos across the galaxy. After learning from a [[Unidentified First Order officer (Exegol)|fellow officer]] that the Resistance was targeting the navigation tower on Exegol, Pryde had the source of the navigation signal needed for the Sith fleet to deploy from Exegol switched to the ''Steadfast'', declaring that they would guide the fleet out themselves. However, Resistance General [[Finn]] realized that the signal had been transferred to the ''Steadfast'', and the Resistance's [[Exegol landing team|ground team]] concocted a daring plan to land on the [[hull]] of the ''Steadfast''. Pryde had legions of [[Sith trooper]]s and [[Sith Jetpack Trooper]]s deployed to repel any boarders and also ordered a bridge technician to jam the Resistance speeders, only to be informed that they were not using speeders; rather, to Pryde's astonishment, the Resistance mounted a cavalry charge on orbaks against the Sith troopers, causing a battle to break out on the ship's hull.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n[[File:Episode_IX_SD_fleet.png|thumb|left|250px|The Sith Eternal's Final Order fleet was under Pryde's command during the battle of Exegol.]]\nPryde was further baffled when [[Citizens' Fleet|another fleet]] comprised of thousands of ships arrived to reinforce the Resistance, wanting to know where such a vast amount of ships had come from, given that the Resistance had no navy. Admiral Griss, also in attendance, shocked Pryde by remarking that it wasn't a navy, but the ordinary people of the galaxy, rising up and coming together to turn back the darkness that threatened them.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\nWhen Finn and [[Jannah]] were successful in shutting down the transmitter, the Resistance prepared to depart the ship, having beaten back a multitude of Sith troopers. However, First Order leader merely gave the order to reset the ''Steadfast''{{'s}} systems, which Finn caught on to. He and Jannah chose to stay on the ship while the rest of the ground team escaped.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n===Death===\nHolding back onslaughts of Sith troopers, Finn and Jannah successfully destroyed the ''Steadfast'' by turning its [[turbolaser]]s against the [[Starship|ship]] itself, corresponding with the final demise of Darth Sidious at the hands of Rey. As the ''Steadfast'' began to crumble under its own firepower, Pryde ran towards the front of the bridge and stared out at the Sith fleet as it was overwhelmed and destroyed by the allied fleet. Pryde did not have long to despair, however, as a massive explosion consumed the bridge of the ''Steadfast'', killing all present on it and hurling Pryde's lifeless body through the [[viewport]].<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Where did they get all these fighter craft?

Pryde recognized that he knew more about Emperor Palpatine and Snoke's machinations than most of his cohorts and used it to maintain his own power.<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" />\n\nUnlike his First Order allies, Pryde displayed a tolerance for mysticism but refused to voice his opinions. When the First Order joined forces with the Sith Eternal, he was ambitious to use their forces while most of the First Order clashed with their new allies. Pryde viewed the arcane behavior of the Sith Eternal as by-products of a thirst for power. Unlike more arrogant officers, he knew not to disrespect these beliefs as he had personally seen [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] in action.<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" /> General Hux speculated that Pryde had something about him that kept him unafraid, immune and safe when informing Supreme Leader Kylo Ren of bad news, and that it kept him from Force choked or getting beheaded.<ref name=\"TROS Expanded\" />\n\nAs a [[First Order officer]], Enric Pryde was a calm yet highly intelligent and ruthless general. Although Pryde served the Order faithfully, he had a disdain for the gruesome and horrible aspects of it.<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" /> After the Resistance fighters [[Mission to Kijimi|escaped]] the ''Steadfast'', Pryde was the first officer to identify General Hux's betrayal as the spy against the First Order and ruthlessly executed him on the spot without hesitation, showing no remorse for his actions. Pryde could see the value in the legions of Star Destroyers that had been created by the Final Order, even when others dismissed it. Pryde viewed the Starkiller Base superweapon as an \"error\", as the resources used in its construction and subsequently lost when it was blown up by the Resistance had made it difficult for the First Order to maintain a firm hold on the galaxy, and saw the offer of the Sith Destroyer fleet as a means of correcting that error.<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" />\n\nAlthough Pryde had ambition when it came to cementing his power,<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" /> his allegiance was to Emperor Palpatine alone as a veteran of the Galactic Empire since he gave control over the First Order to him. Pryde was able to maintain a calm composure even when bewildered, such as when an allied fleet arrived to reinforce the Resistance at the battle at Exegol,<ref name=\"Episode IX\" /> something he had no backup plan for.<ref name=\"TROS Expanded\" /> When facing his death, Pryde ultimately lost his cool composition, giving in to anger and fear when faced with his last defeat.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\nEnric Pryde was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]]<ref name=\"EpIXVD\" /> who had [[Color|blue]] [[eye]]s, fair skin, and gray [[hair]].
