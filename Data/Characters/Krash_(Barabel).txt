A disgraced [[shockboxer]], Krash led the kill team of the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority]]. Krash was active during the Sorority's conflict with the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nGaining much success as a [[shockboxer]], Krash lost a bout that cost him his career. Bearing a terrible facial scar from the accident, Krash kept to himself in [[Cantina/Legends|cantinas]] throughout [[Taleucema]] where he attempted to drink himself to death, using [[spice]] to numb the pain. It was in a cantina that Krash was approached by the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority]] to lead a kill team of four other, mixed race agents. Dedicated to the Sorority and shaking his addictions and shame, Krash carried a [[Heavy blaster pistol/Legends|heavy blaster pistol]] and [[Shockmitt|shock gloves]]. Well paid and given reasonable accommodations in Taeucema, Krash's men were equally loyal beings.<ref name=\"MPQ\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Mask of the Pirate Queen]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Barabel]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Saleucamians]]\n[[Category:Veiled Sorority members]]"}}}]}}}}
