When Revan asked him about the missing [[Selkath/Legends|Selkath]] he attempted to charge him two hundred [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] for some information. He also revealed to Revan information about [[Sunry]]'s affair with [[Elassa Huros]] without charging (although he wanted to, he mistakenly uttered it). He said he wasn't interested in either the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] or the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], and they weren't interested in him. When he heard about the [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|attack]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] he openly mocked the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] defeat to Revan, not being aware that Revan was a Jedi.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGonto Yas was somewhat of a rude person and a sore loser when it came to pazaak. When he lost a game, he blamed it on luck, believing that his skill was better then others, even if he was on a losing streak. He liked to gossip, calling the affair between Sunry and Huros a \"juicy tidbit.\" He was also in some ways a hustler who would try to earn credits by selling information that wasn't much of a help.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIt is possible to make Yas reveal the information involving the missing Selkath without paying by threatening him. This gives the player [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points. Performing a [[Mind trick/Legends|Force persuasion]] attempt on Yas also gives the player dark Side points.\n\nIf the player beats him ten times at pazaak, Yas will eventually refuse to play, saying that he can't afford to.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fi=Gonto Yas\n|pl=Gonto Yas\n|ru=\u0413\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e \u042f\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yas, Gonto}}\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]"}}}]}}}}
