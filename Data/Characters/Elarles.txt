Though [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|the male]] had the calloused hands of a typical miner, [[Leia Organa Solo|his female companion]] did not. Elarles informed a nearby Imperial bureaucrat of his suspicions.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye 1|''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'' 1]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Elarles\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mimban residents]]\n[[Category:Waiters]]"}}}]}}}}
