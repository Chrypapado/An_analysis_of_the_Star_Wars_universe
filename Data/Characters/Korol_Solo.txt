Early in the novel, [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] attempts to prove that Han is of royal birth and thus entitled to marry [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]], by revealing that Han is descended from Korol, and thereby the rightful \"King of Corellia\". At the end of the novel, however, Threepio is told by the \"city computer\" that Korol was merely a pretender with no valid claim.\n\nHowever, the novel does not make it completely clear that this second revelation is the truth, leaving open the possibility that it is misinformation engineered with the connivance of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], in line with Han's preference to keep his ancestry opaque. Also uncertain is the question of whether Korol's son Dalla Solo was indeed Han's grandfather, who is elsewhere named as [[Den Solo]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Courtship of Princess Leia]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[King/Legends|King]] of the [[Corellian Empire]] (pretender)\n|years=c.
