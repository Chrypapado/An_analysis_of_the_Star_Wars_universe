I am at your disposal. Feel free to make us all incredibly wealthy and famous.|Jory|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Jory''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Kadas'sa'Nikto/Legends|Kadas'sa'Nikto]] who was hired by [[Braden]] to provide security for the Great Hunt's base of operations on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]. While on Hutta, Braden discovered a [[Hunter (individual)|bounty hunter]] whom he intended to enter the [[Great Hunt (Jedi)|Great Hunt]]. Unfortunately while the bounty hunter was targeting [[Vexx]], [[Tarro Blood]] had Jory and Braden killed, leaving Mako and the hunter to continue the Hunt alone.\n\n==Biography==\n===Supporting the best===\n{{Quote|And the big bruiser is Jory. He handles the heavy lifting and provides security for our base of operations.|Braden introduces Jory.|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nJory was a [[Kadas'sa'Nikto/Legends|Kadas'sa'Nikto]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who worked with the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Braden]] and the [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] [[Mako (slicer)|Mako]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]]. He handled the heavy lifting for the crew and provided security for their base of operations, a backroom in the [[Poison Pit]] [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in the town of [[Jiguuna]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]].<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" /> In [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"Dates\">{{TOR_dates|1}}</ref> Braden found a [[Hunter (individual)|new prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] who he hoped could win the competition known as the [[Great Hunt (competition)|Great Hunt]]. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 traveled to the base of operations on Nal Hutta and Braden introduced Mako and Jory as the bounty hunter's support crew.<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" />\n\nIn order to enter the Great Hunt, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would need the sponsorship of local [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Suudaa Nem'ro]] and so Braden had Mako find a nearby [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] that the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 could claim in order to cement their reputation. After the slicer suggested the criminal [[Vexx]] be the group's target, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 left to search for information on Vexx at the criminal's [[Vexx's safehouse|safehouse]]. While the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was gone, Jory and Mako worked on what Braden described as \"all the little details\" of their mission so that the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would not have to. While Braden was visiting [[Nem'ro's Palace]], Mako discussed with Jory how she wished to participate in missions rather than staying at the base with him. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 then returned with a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] from the safehouse and Jory complemented his new associate's skill while Mako searched the device. After she discovered a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] ticket that Vexx had booked, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 left in order to catch the criminal before he could leave Nal Hutta.<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" />\n\n===A casualty of the Hunt===\n{{Quotetrans|Then your mission is a failure. Your quarry is not here &mdash;and now revealed, your hunt has failed.|Jory fails to realise that he and Branden are Tarro Blood's true targets|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nWhile the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was gone, the bounty hunter [[Tarro Blood]] and his associate [[Sedyn Kyne]] arrived at the base of operations while Braden and Jory were inside. Braden told the hunter to leave, but Blood introduced himself and explained that he also hoped to win the Great Hunt and so was removing the competition. Assuming that Blood planned to kill Braden's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jory declared the rival hunter's mission a failure as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was not in the base and now Jory and Braden knew Blood's plan. Blood revealed that, as directly attacking other competitors was against the rules of the Great Hunt, he planned to instead eliminate his rival's support. Blood then ordered Kyne to kill Braden and Jory and left the room. Braden ordered Jory to shoot Kyne, but neither of them was quick enough to out draw their foe and he killed each with a single shot.<ref name=\"Last Flight\" />\n\nThe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 returned to the base after successfully killing Vexx and discovered Braden and Jory's bodies where Kyne had left them. Mako then returned and mourned the loss of her two friends, before she and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 checked the surveillance systems that she and Jory had set up in their base of operations. The pair watched a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] showing what had occurred, and swore to continue in their goal to win the Great Hunt so that they could defeat Blood for what he had done. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 then left to meet with Nem'ro while Mako used the pay out from Vexx's bounty to give Jory and Braden a proper burial. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ultimately avenged Jory and killed Taro Blood before successfully winning the Great Hunt.<ref name=\"Last Flight\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I do admit a fondness for material stability.|Jory|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nAt the [[Time/Legends|time]] of his death,<ref name=\"Last Flight\" /> Jory considered Mako to be young<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" /> and she referred to him as an \"old-timer\".<ref name=\"Last Flight\" /> When she said she would rather be out in the field then stuck at the base with him, he took no offence due to her age.<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" /> He was impressed by the natural talents of Braden's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and considered himself lucky to be working in the support crew,<ref name=\"Last Flight\" /> which he hoped would make him rich and famous. Jory was fond of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and material stability, so although he did not know the exact nature of the Great Hunt, Jory hoped the prize would be an easily divisible pay out.
