He was taken by [[Abeloth]] and used as a way to turn the Oldtimers and the [[Theran Listener]]s against the Skywalkers and Khai who pursued her. When Skywalker cut Callista's personality out of Abeloth, Nenn was strong enough to take a lightsaber and kill himself, further weakening Abeloth and stopping the Theran Listeners from following her and freeing the Horn siblings from her grasp.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]'' {{1st|''Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'' audiobook}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nenn\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hosts of Abeloth]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nam Chorios residents]]\n[[Category:Therans]]"}}}]}}}}
