My goal is to do a series of articles on the Meatlumps to try and shed some light on who they are and why they do the things they do.|Vani Korr, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Vani Korr''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] journalist on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], working for the ''[[Corellia Times]]'' in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==The Meatlumps case==\n{{Quote|You might try heading back to Corellia. Word is that some reporter is investigating the Meatlumps and is looking for someone to do her heavy lifting.|[[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Orden Tarc|Tarc]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nFollowing the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Vani Korr started to investigate the activities of the [[Meatlumps]], a group of fanatical anti-technology thugs present on Corellia.<ref name=\"SWG:Ftootvs\" /> Nevertheless, around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the Meatlumps discovered her activities and decided to stop her. The Meatlump [[Sublieutenant/Legends|sublieutenant]] [[Merkie Howzat]] and a group of Meatlump stooges attacked her [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] in Coronet, overturned it while she was driving. Korr was thrown clear and knocked unconscious. The woman was rescued by [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] troopers and she was hospitalized in the [[Coronet Hospital]]. This attack almost put her research to a complete halt.<ref name=\"SWG:Ftootvs\" />\n\n[[File:Corellia_times_building.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ''Corellia Times'' building in Coronet]]\nA short time later, a spacer witnessed a group of Meatlumps vandalizing some [[Power generator/Legends|power generators]] in Coronet and intervened.<ref name=\"SWG:HVKItM\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=general|Help Vani Korr Investigate the Meatlumps|Corellia}}</ref> The result was some fierce combat, in which the Meatlumps were defeated. Just after the initial fighting had ceased, Merkie Howzat arrived at the scene only to be defeated by the traveler, too.<ref name=\"SWG:MH\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|Merkie Howzat|Corellia}}</ref> The traveler found a [[Viewscreen/Legends|viewscreen]] with the ''Corellia Times'' logo on it and decided to find its owner. The spacer met with a ''Corellia Times'' employee, [[Finn Shallo]], outside the newspaper building, who told the traveler that the viewscreen belonged to Vani Korr and suggested that the traveler meet her in the hospital. When the traveler arrived, Vani saw an opportunity to finish her work on the Meatlumps and asked for the traveler's help.<ref name=\"SWG:Ftootvs\" />\n\n[[File:MeatlumpStoogesCoronet.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A group of Meatlump stooges in Coronet]]\nThe traveler agreed to help her retrieve a number of Meatlump [[Datapad/Legends|datapads]] with vital information on them. The traveler stalked the Meatlump hangout spots around Coronet and managed to acquire nine datapads, which were delivered to Vani. Unfortunately for Vani, the datapads were encrypted, and a passcode was needed to access their contents. Vani, however, devised a shrewd plan. She reckoned that the members of the higher echelons of the Meatlump hierarchy might have the passcode. The traveler was to go to one of the many Meatlump camps scattered around Coronet and send an emergency signal from their communication device to the Meatlump headquarters, which was most likely to prompt them to send a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] to investigate the call. When the lieutenant arrived, the traveler was to persuade him to tell the code to the traveler. The plan was executed, and after some aggressive negotiations, the traveler acquired the code&mdash;which was actually just \"meatlumps\"&mdash;and passed it on to Vani, who was now able to finish her investigation and write the first part of a revealing article on the Meatlumps entitled ''[[Who are the Meatlumps?]]''. As a token of gratitude, Vani Korr gave the traveler an advance print of her article as well as a small amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].<ref name=\"SWG:HVKItM\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=general|Help Vani Korr Investigate the Meatlumps|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Meatlumps.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A Meatlump camp near Coronet]]\nExamination of the datapads revealed that one communication contained a mention to a \"[[Meatlump King|King of the Meatlumps]].\" Vani Korr thought it was exactly the kind of scoop she was hoping for and decided to investigate further. To prove the existence of the Meatlump King, she needed to find him first. She thus tasked the spacer to find the [[Meatlump Hideout]]. With this aim in view, she started tracking recent crimes of vandalism against machinery and technology in order to find a link to the Meatlumps. The first she found was an attack against [[Talan Joben]]'s [[Joben Crate Company|crate-manufacturing company]] in which machinery and crates were destroyed. However, the spacer discovered that the retired [[Scout/Legends|explorer]] turned [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorist]] [[Riyan Kiner]] was responsible.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP1\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 1|Corellia}}</ref> Vani later found a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] engineer, [[Zorajas Garamin]], who claimed his droids had been sabotaged. Again, it was a dead end since Garamin was in fact a delusional farmer who tried to culture droids by planting them in the soil.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP2\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 2|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer then traveled to [[Talus/Legends|Talus]] to meet a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] racer by the name [[Sul Prine]]. While the presence of Meatlumps on another world was unlikely, Prine pretended that a band of Meatlumps destroyed the speeder bikes parked at [[Sul Prine's Place|his place]]. The spacer hence discovered that a group of Meatlumps led by the lieutenant [[Strilath Farles]] was actually [[Meatlump Camps|based]] on Talus.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 3|Corellia}}</ref> The adventurer encountered Strilath Farles in [[Doaba Guerfel/Legends|Doaba Guerfel]] and tried to negotiate the location of the Meatlump Hideout in exchange for some help against [[Gramo Murah]]'s [[Ragtags]]. However, the spacer was deceived since Farles ignored the location of the hideout.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP4\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 4|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MeatlumpKing-SWGTCGAoD.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Meatlump King]]\nThe next lead was finally the right one. Vani Korr received word that a Meatlump was smashing generators in Coronet. This old Meatlump, [[Alliin Mepou]], was quite disillusioned but he could not retire from the Meatlumps unless a new person take his place. The spacer, who realized he could use this situation to infiltrate the Meatlumps, indeed accepted to replace the old man. The spacer therefore went to work for Alliin Mepou's lieutenant: [[Kaiya Merel]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP5\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 5|Corellia}}</ref> The woman considered positively the admission of the adventurer among the Meatlumps but not without testing this new recruit. As a first mission, the spacer was tasked to help two [[Rogue CorSec]] [[Officer/Legends|officers]], [[Erinn Bonette]] and [[Echdo Bervekk]], to hijack a [[shuttle/Legends|shuttle]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP6\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 6|Corellia}}</ref> Then, Kaiya Merel ordered her new recruit to disrupt the plans of one of her rivals, another Meatlump lieutenant by the name [[Stephax Dain]]. The spacer traveled to [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Rori/Legends|Rori]] and killed Dain to not let him get any credit for his successful attack of a [[Weapons Research Facility (Rori)|Weapons Research Facility]]. Kaiya Merel was extremely satisfied of the death of her rival and definitively accepted the spacer among the Meatlumps.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP7\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|The Meatlumps Hideout, Part 7|Corellia}}</ref> Finally, she also gave the spacer the location of the Meatlump Hideout, located in some abandoned [[Coronet Maintenance Tunnels|maintenance tunnels]] below Coronet, and free access to it.<ref name=\"SWG:MHYFT\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|Meatlumps Hideout: Your First Time|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nAs Vani Korr's work was giving positive results, another ''Corellia Times'' reporter, [[Halden Wes]], joined the investigation to assist the young woman. While she focused on the Meatlump Hideout on Corellia, Wes was more interested in the Meatlump activities and violent actions committed on other worlds.<ref name=\"SWG:MtM\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|Muddle the Meatlumps|Corellia}}</ref> In the meantime, the spacer entered the Meatlump Hideout and finally encountered the legendary Meatlump King. The information gathered in the hideout allowed Vani Korr to finalize her article.<ref name=\"SWG:MtM2\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|Meet the Meatlumps|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVani Korr was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:Ftootvs\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Vani Korr was added to the game with the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 21 Notes for 4 August 2005|Publish 21]],\" released on [[August 4]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\nThe original quests involving Vani Korr were pre-[[:w:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|NGE]] quests forming the \"[[:w:c:swg:Corellian Times Investigations|Corellian Times Investigations]]\" story arc.
