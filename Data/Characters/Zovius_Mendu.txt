By [[3964 BBY]], [[Gender/Legends|he]] had built enough of a reputation to have the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Feln]] personally hunting him. Keen to find a way off Taris, Mendu enlisted local hood [[Marn Hierogryph]] to help him escape the planet&mdash;Hierogryph arranged to have Mendu shipped to the planet [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] in an old [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] disguised to look like a crate of dried [[dreeka]] [[Fish/Legends|fish]]. The plan was a success, and Mendu was thought to have disappeared.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Or something.

Hierogryph hired [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]] [[Gorman Vandrayk|Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk]] to refit an old [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] into a shipping container.
