Her father gave her his ship, the [[Adventurer (Crescent-class)|''Adventurer'']], a [[Crescent-class Transport|''Crescent''-class transport]] Mark II built by [[Hyrotii Corporation/Legends|Hyrotii Corporation]], as a graduation gift, partly because he had almost not used the ship in eighteen years. He hoped she could use the ship more than him.\n\nOfficer Lynx was then assigned to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] base on [[Nigel III]], in the [[Kira sector]], and she performed many planetary activities, not using her ship.\n\nAt a certain point, [[Commodore/Legends|Commodore]] [[Dane Tizzin]], Naval attach to the staff of the sectorial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], became the target of an assassination plot. Officer Reglis impersonated [[Sapphire (smuggler)|Sapphire]], a smuggler and [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] agent, to save Tizzin.\n\nShe then decided to replace the ''Adventurer's'' [[sensor package]] with a [[counter-sensor package]] to have a stealthy ship, something she reasoned could be useful. Before she and a technician could finish the customization, Lynx was implicated in an information leak of the Nigel base, and she was forced to flee from the Imperial military justice. She left behind her ship and other personal possessions for the Empire to impound.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Stock Ships]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reglis, Lynx}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Intelligence personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]"}}}]}}}}
