He owned a [[Vexx's Safehouse|safehouse]] in the town of [[Jiguuna]] on the planet [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], and was [[Death/Legends|killed]] while preparing to board a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] offworld by a [[Hunter (individual)|bounty hunter]] who sought to claim Vexx's bounty in order to cement a reputation in the area.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|What's this?

While searching for the nastiest, most brutal, untouchable scum in the area, the [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] [[Mako (slicer)|Mako]] came across Vexx's bounty and brought it to the attention of the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Braden]] and his [[Hunter (individual)|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]], who were looking for an impressive local target that could cement the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e's reputation on Hutta.<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" />\n\nOn that same [[Standard day/Legends|day]], Vexx had booked a ticket for a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] leaving from [[Jiguuna Spaceport]], leaving a receipt for the purchase amongst the detailed records he kept on an encrypted [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] at his safehouse.<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" /> The [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] then traveled to one of the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport's]] hangars with a [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] and a [[Vexx's Crew|crew]] of twelve Human [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] and six [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] thugs. As he prepared to board the shuttle, Vexx was confronted by Braden's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e,<ref name=\"Last Flight\" /> who had learned of the smuggler's location after discovering the datapad in a raid on Vexx's safehouse.<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" /> Vexx was surprised to find himself cornered, but was confident that he could defeat his opponent; however, the bounty hunter [[Death/Legends|killed]] Vexx in the ensuing fight. The hunter then took the Corellian's [[ID tag]]s as proof of his death and returned to Braden, only to discover that both Braden and his associate [[Jory]] had been killed on the orders of the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Tarro Blood]]. Mako then used the [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from Vexx's bounty to give Braden and Jory a decent burial.<ref name=\"Last Flight\" />\n\nThe bounty hunter who had killed Vexx went on to compete against Blood in the [[Great Hunt (competition)|Great Hunt]] competition, and during the event the Mandalorian contacted Vexx's siblings and inaccurately informed them that the hunter had killed Vexx by shooting the smuggler in the back. Vorr and Vye then confronted the hunter on the planet [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]] in order to avenge Vexx.<ref name=\"Ambitions\" />\n\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nInstead of trying to convince the siblings that they had been lied to by Blood, the bounty hunter attacked and killed them both.<ref name=\"Ambitions\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Vexx is the galaxy's greatest quick-draw artist.
