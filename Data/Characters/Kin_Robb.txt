The droid displays unusual hostility toward the honorable Kin Robb.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|Voyage of Temptation}}\n'''Kin Robb''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] who served as the [[Senator]] of [[Taris]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. During her time as a senator, she was a close ally and acquaintance of many noted figures, including Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] and Duchess [[Satine Kryze]] of [[Mandalore]]. Robb was part of the [[Council of Neutral Systems]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\nKin Robb was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]]<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" /> from the [[planet]] [[Taris]]<ref name=\"Join the Battle\" /> who served as its [[Senator]] in the [[Galactic Senate]] during the waning years of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" />\n\n===Aboard the ''Coronet''===\nDuring the [[Clone Wars]], Robb was part of the [[Council of Neutral Systems]],<ref name=\"The Mandalore Plot\" /> an outlier [[Politics|political]] wing of the [[Pacifist Faction]] in the senate.<ref name=\"Rise\">''[[Rise of the Separatists]]''</ref>\nRobb accompanied [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]] of [[Mandalore]] aboard the ''[[Coronet]]'' along with several other senators including [[Orn Free Taa]] of [[Ryloth]], and [[Onaconda Farr]] of [[Rodia]]. The party also included Mandalore's own Senator, [[Tal Merrik]]. Robb had drinks in the hospitality suite with Satine and the other senators, nodding and smiling politely when the Duchess introduced Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to them, though her smile faded when Kenobi and Kryze began a heated argument. After tensions were defused, Robb joined the other senators at dinner. However, while the party dined, terror hit the spacecraft, and numerous [[SD-K4 assassin droid|assassin probes]] attacked the party, having been sent by Merrik, who was a traitor. Once the probes were dealt with, they returned to dinner where they were subjected to a test of Kenobi's using the last surviving probe killer. Reasoning that the droid would attempt to kill the Duchess and her allies, Kenobi placed it near all four senators, suspects as the crate holding the droids had been marked with the Senate stamp. Robb was uncomfortable with the idea and leaned away from the droid when it was her turn, but Kenobi absolved her of suspicion by noting the droid's \"unusual hostility\" towards her. Merrick was exposed as the traitor and his [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] allies soon [[Skirmish aboard the Coronet|attacked]] the vessel. Robb quickly ran to Senator Farr's aid when the probe killer attacked him. She survived the events on the Coronet.<ref name=\"VoT\">{{TCW|Voyage of Temptation}}</ref>\n\n===Military Oversight Committee===\n[[File:AangJogan-EvilPlans.png|thumb|left|202x202px|Robb attends the banquet]]\nRobb attended drinks and dinner with the [[Military Oversight Committee]] on which [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] attempted to sway votes to try and reduce military funding. Robb seemed very happy that [[Senator]] [[Aang]] was pleased with Amidala's presentation.<ref name=\"Evil Plans\">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref>\n\n===Hostage Crisis===\n[[File:Throw_him_in.png|thumb|right|227x227px|Robb gasps at Skywalker's defeat]]\nRobb was part of a small group of senators who wished to stop a vote on the the [[Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill]], and attended a meeting of those opposed<ref name=\"VE\">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref> led by Senator [[Philo]], when they were all [[Senate hostage crisis|trapped]] in the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] by [[Cad Bane]] and several other [[bounty hunter]]s working to free [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] the [[Hutt]]. When Philo attempted to storm out, Bane callously shot him in the back as an example, horrifying Robb and her fellows. Robb was made to surrender any communication devices on her person and watched in shock as [[Anakin Skywalker]] was thrown into the prison. Robb was evidently also very frightened and horrified at the disgraceful injustice displayed. She and the others were nearly killed when Bane's pre-planted explosives detonated, but were saved in the nick of time when Skywalker cut through the floor and dropped them all one floor down just as the bombs went off. Though coughing and a bit dazed from the fall and smoke, Robb was unharmed.<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" />\n\n===Vote to escalate clone production===\n[[File:KinRobbAides-SM.png|thumb|left|200px|Robb applauds in the Senate]]\nWhen Padm\u00e9 Amidala delivered the winning speech for the opposing side of [[Republic military enhancement bill|troop escalation]], Robb happily clapped with her aides, who were also cheering on the Senator from [[Naboo]], possibly indicating support for a decrease in military spending.<ref name=\"Pursuit\">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref>\n\n===Murders in the Senate===\nWhen a vote to send thousands of more clones into conflict arose with [[Halle Burtoni]] as the leading senator, murders began to happen in the Senate beginning with [[Onaconda Farr]]. Robb, a close friend of the Rodian, attended his [[Funeral of Onaconda Farr|funeral]] and was amongst the saddest in attendance, gazing mournfully after his departing transport even after the others had left.<ref name=\"SM\">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref>\n\n===Presiding over Ahsoka Tano===\nFollowing the [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing]] of the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]], and [[Ahsoka Tano]] being accused of the crimes, a [[Trial of Ahsoka Tano|trial]] was called to decide her fate. Robb was a member of the jury presiding over the former [[Jedi]], where she and the other jurors listened to the arguments brought forth by Senator Amidala, Tano's defense counsel, and Admiral Tarkin, the prosecutor. What Robb believed remained unknown, but the jury's verdict was made irrelevant as [[Anakin Skywalker]] brought forward the true culprit, [[Barriss Offee]]. Tano was thus cleared of all charges, but the ordeal greatly affected her and she declined an offer to rejoin the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"The Wrong Jedi\">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>\n\n===Invasion of Scipio===\nAfter [[Rush Clovis]], newly instated head of the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]], was forced to raise interest rates on the Republic, the Senate convened in session to express outrage, with Robb vocally making her anger clear by shouting that the Chancellor had been warned of such an eventuality.<ref name=\"Rise of Clovis\">{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref> After another emergency session was called revealing that [[Scipio]], the location of the banks, had been invaded by the Separatists, Robb immediately called for a counter-invasion to secure the banks for the Republic, a motion at once supported by Senators [[Meena Tills]], [[Mot-Not Rab]], [[Stonk]], and [[Riyo Chuchi]]. The motion was successfully passed and Scipio was [[Invasion of Scipio|liberated]] from Separatist control, with control over the banks being directly ceded to the office of the Supreme Chancellor. Robb applauded the announcement and Chancellor Palpatine's vow to relinquish such powers once the war was over.<ref name=\"Crisis at the Heart\">{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}</ref>\n\n===Connections===\nDuring the early [[Galactic Civil War]], Senator [[Tynnra Pamlo]], who represented Taris in the [[Imperial Senate]], wore a necklace called the [[Amulet of the Robb]].<ref name=\"R1VG\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref> Kin Robb also shared her name with [[New Republic]] Tarisian Senator [[Andrithal Robb-Voti]].<ref name=\"TFA VD\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKin Robb was a human female with dark skin and [[Color|brown]] [[hair]] and [[eye]]s.<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" /> She was two [[meter]]s tall.<ref name=\"Kin Robb\">{{Databank|kin-robb|Kin Robb|archivedate=20170605234201}}</ref> During the Clone Wars, she was noted to have a reputation for honor by Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref name=\"VoT\" /> Her political affiliations during her time as a senator indicated that she favoured a peaceful resolution to the Clone Wars and to preserve the democratic institutions of the Republic from the encroachment of wartime emergency powers<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" /><ref name=\"The Mandalore Plot\" /><ref name=\"Evil Plans\" />, though she did break from this and propose immediate military action if there was a direct and imminent threat to the Republic's stability.<ref name=\"Crisis at the Heart\" /> Kin Robb did not trust Rush Clovis and did not hesitate to vocally reprimand the Chancellor for ignoring her and her colleagues' warnings about him.<ref name=\"Crisis at the Heart\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nKin Robb wore ornate clothing consisting of a shiny gold vest over a long dress in a shade of deep purple, which was the traditional color of administration on her native planet of Taris,<ref name=\"TFA VD\" /> along with a violet headpiece.<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKin Robb first appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' [[The Clone Wars: Season One|season one]] episode \"[[Hostage Crisis]],\"<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" /> and was first identified in the [[The Clone Wars: Season Two|season two]] episode \"[[Voyage of Temptation]].\"<ref name=\"VoT\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}\n*{{TCW|Senate Spy}}\n*{{TCW|The Mandalore Plot}}\n*{{TCW|Voyage of Temptation}} {{1stID}}\n*{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}\n*{{TCW|Corruption}} {{Flash}}\n*{{TCW|Evil Plans}}\n*{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}} {{1st}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=Hostage Crisis (short story)|sformatted=Hostage Crisis|book=The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark}}\n*{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}} {{Flash}}\n*{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}\n*{{TCW|Senate Murders}}\n*{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}\n*{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}\n*{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode022.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Hostage Crisis|archivedate=20110630093108}} {{Imo}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode204.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Senate Spy|archivedate=20110819210357}} {{Po}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode213.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Voyage of Temptation|archivedate=20110615074612}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode308.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Evil Plans|archivedate=20110902130517}} {{Po}}\n*{{SW|url=explore/the-clone-wars/ep122|text=\"Hostage Crisis\" - ''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide}} {{Imo}}\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/voyage-of-temptation-episode-guide|text=\"Voyage of Temptation\" Episode Guide &ndash;
