Although technically an employee of [[Outer Rim Oreworks Company|Outer Rim Oreworks]], Chief Ertine served the citizens of the Landing as their [[Constable/Legends|constable]], along with the [[Security Chief's Second]]s.\n\nAt that point, the Landing and its surrounding area were terrorized by a gang of raiders led by a supposed Jedi sorcerer known as [[Byrch Dyshkava|The Padawan]]. The citizens asked Chief Ertine to stop them. Ertine gathered his Seconds, including a young [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] ex-sailor named [[Mix Liddell]], and they tracked The Padawan to his gang's hideout.\n\nUnfortunately, The Padawan saw them coming and arranged his men to ambush Ertine. Ertine and his Seconds were killed, except for Liddell who barely survived.\n\nEventually, Liddell was appointed Chief, stopped The Padawan and named his [[speederboat]] [[Ertine (speederboat)|''Ertine'']], after the old Chief.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|7|Bartyn's Landing (article)|Bartyn's Landing}} {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Lamaredd residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]"}}}]}}}}
