He offered the team 8,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to temporarily deactivate a Naboo [[Sensor array/Legends|sensor array]] located just outside of the city as part of the Federation's invasion plans. Daal told the students he simply wanted to evade taxes on a rare [[Spice/Legends|spice]] shipment in order to increase profits, and intended to land while the [[Sensor/Legends|sensor]] was deactivated. In reality, Daal's unnamed backer was the Trade Federation, which wanted to move [[Jammer|jamming]] [[Satellite/Legends|satellites]] into Naboo [[Realspace/Legends|space]] undetected in preparation for an [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|invasion of the planet]]. Daal was later captured and detained by [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20010809a|text=Signal Interruption|int=Signal Interruption|archivedate=20091016011838}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daal, Raymas}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Trade Federation members]]"}}}]}}}}
