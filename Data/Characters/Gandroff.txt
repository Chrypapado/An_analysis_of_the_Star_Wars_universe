My mood's sour enough without you here.|Gandroff to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nAfter racing for years, he retired and moved to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he encountered the redeemed [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who was looking for the [[Star Map]]. Gandroff offered advice to him about [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop racing]], and [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] won the Tatooine Sector Championship by racing at [[Motta]]'s.\n\nHe knew [[Zoriis Bafka]] and [[Nico Senvi]] and admired their skills as racers, but was slightly worried about them being very young, as swoop racing was a cutthroat business.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe player has the option to (like with many others on Tatooine) insult Gandroff, or threaten him for credits. Doing so will result in a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark Side]] shift.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0444\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
