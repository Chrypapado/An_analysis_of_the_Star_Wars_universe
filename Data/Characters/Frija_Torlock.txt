Their plan was to incriminate [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] Torlock as a traitor so that he would be removed from power. The removal of Torlock would allow Droon to take the Governor's seat.\n\n[[File:FrijaTorlock2-FF127.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Torlock wielding an E-11 blaster rifle]]\nHowever, the plan was found out by Governor Torlock and he made plans to flee Corulag. He was able to escape but not before he activated two [[Human replica droid]]s disguised as [[Lexhannen Torlock (droid)|himself]] and his [[Frija Torlock (droid)|daughter]]. Admiral Droon's men eventually captured the droid replica of Torlock, but quickly realized that the real Torlock had escaped. Interrogating the droid, they also learned of the droid copy of Frija. Frija was concerned about her droid counterpart and ordered that Droon dismantle the droid. To do this, Droon hired [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] to destroy both droids and make it appear as though the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]] was to blame. Droon believed that the ruse would throw off all suspicion as to the whereabouts of the real Torlock and leave him free to take the Governor's spot.\n\nHowever, Frija and Droon did not count on the interference of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] and his agent, [[Wrenga Jixton]]. Jix infiltrated the base and discovered the plan. After a runabout in which Droon tried to destroy all evidence and Jix as well, Jix escaped Imperial clutches and confronted the traitorous pair. In the final showdown, Droon tried to blame the entire plan on Frija. In retaliation Frija grabbed a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and tried to shoot her backstabbing lover. Jix was too fast for her and shot her in the chest. Jix captured Droon and presented him to Vader. Meanwhile, Frija's replica droid escaped with her \"father\" and the two made their way to the remote [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]].\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the [[Mind-witch]] [[S'ybll]] used an [[Mind trick/Legends|illusion]] of Frija to trap [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] on the planet [[Tarnoonga]]. Skywalker eventually realized the truth and the illusion was dropped. The mind-witch wanted to propose an alliance with the nascent [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] to overthrow the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]]. When Skywalker refused, he was forced to kill the witch.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Shadow Stalker]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Iceworld]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]'' {{C|Force Illusion}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*{{FFCite|127|FRI1-4, ''Frija Torlock''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040325web|text=Galactic Gazetteer: Hoth and the Greater Javin|int=Galactic Gazetteer: Hoth and the Greater Javin|archivedate=20100508024939}} {{C|Spelled Turlock}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Torlock, Frija}}\n[[Category:Agents of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
