Active during the last years of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], he became a key signatory on the [[New Republic Provisional Council]]. When the Provisional Council became the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]] in [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], Kerrithrarr continued to represent the interests of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] as senior [[Senator/Legends|Senator]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Kerrithrarr_Signature.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Kerrithrarr's signature]]\n'''Kerrithrarr''' was a [[Color/Legends|black]]-furred, [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]]<ref name=\"WG\" /> from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. During the reign of [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Kerrithrarr worked with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] to [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|wage war]] against Palpatine's regime and restore a democratic government to power.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> The war culminated at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], which resulted in the [[Death/Legends|death]] of Emperor Palpatine and his second-in-command, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], as well as the destruction of the second Imperial [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star]] [[Superweapon/Legends|Superweapon]] and much of the Imperial Fleet.{{Fact}}\n\nIn the wake of the victory at Endor, [[Alliance High Command/Legends|Alliance High Command]] convened a month-long [[Constitutional Convention]] to establish a new government.<ref name=\"DFRSB\">''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''</ref> One [[Standard week/Legends|week]] after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the Alliance leadership drafted the [[Declaration of the Alliance of Free Planets]], a document that promised equality, tolerance, social responsibility, and morality to the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. Representing Kashyyyk, Kerrithrarr placed his signature on the document, alongside other important leaders of the Alliance, including [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] of [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]], [[Doman Beruss (Corellian)|Doman Beruss]] of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], [[Borsk Fey'lya]] of [[Kothlis/Legends|Kothlis]], [[Verrinnefra B'thog Indriummsegh]] of [[Elom/Legends|Elom]], [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] of [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] representing the destroyed planet [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], [[Jenssar SoBilles]] of [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], and [[Sian Tevv/Legends|Sian Tevv]] of [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]].<ref name=\"TABSB\">''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nLittle consensus was achieved by the Convention. However, attending members agreed to established a [[New Republic Provisional Council|Provisional Council]],<ref name=\"DFRSB\" /> consisting of Kerrithrarr, Ackbar, Beruss, Fey'lya, Indriummsegh, Mothma, the recently married Leia Organa Solo, and Tevv,<ref name=\"EGTC\">''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> to handle the matters of daily government while formal details were discussed and ratified.<ref name=\"DFRSB\" /> During this time, Kerrithrarr attended Alliance [[Historian/Legends|historian]] [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al's]] [[Report to the Provisional Council of the Alliance of Free Planets]]; a detailed summation of the events after the destruction of the second Death Star. The Report focused primarily on the [[Bakura Incident]],<ref name=\"TABSB\" /> an attack on the planet [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]] by the race of reptilian [[Ssi-ruu]]k<ref name=\"TAB\">''[[The Truce at Bakura]]''</ref> that occurred the day after the Endor victory.<ref name=\"TEC\">[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]</ref>\n\nWithin five weeks of the Battle of Endor,<ref name=\"TABSB\" /> [[Council]]or Kerrithrarr, along with other members of the Provisional Council, signed and legitimized the [[Declaration of a New Republic/Legends|Declaration of a New Republic]]. This new declaration formally dissolved the Alliance to Restore the Republic and established the democratic [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] with [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] as its [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]].<ref name=\"DoNR\">''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]; [[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]; [[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', Declaration of a New Republic; ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', Declaration of a New Republic</ref>\n\nAs the New Republic unified and expanded, [[Imperial Civil War|internal schisms]] fractured the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], and a number of splinter factions vied for control of the Empire's remaining holdings. [[Grand Vizier/Legends|Grand Vizier]] [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]], who had assumed control of the majority of the Empire's forces after Palpatine's death, made arrangements to defect to the New Republic after he discovered that [[Ysanne Isard]], [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]], plotted to overthrow him. Isard informed the Empire's [[Ruling Council]] of Pestage's defection, and the former Grand Vizier was captured. As the New Republic Provisional Council debated rescuing Pestage, it was ultimately Councilor Kerrithrarr's words that swayed the operation's key decrier, Borsk Fey'lya, to support the rescue.<ref name=\"MR\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''</ref>\n\nAs the New Republic continued to wrest worlds from Imperial control, Councilor Fey'lya called for a summit of the Provisional Council in order to discuss taking control of the planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] for both the Empire and its predecessor, the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]]. Fey'lya knew that he would butt heads with Councilor Ackbar, and selected the planet [[Noquivzor]] to be the summit's location, as its warm, dry savannas would be an uncomfortable setting for his predicted opponents. Kerrithrarr, who was from the heavily forested Kashyyyk, was among those targeted by the subtle manipulation. While all of the councilors agreed that taking Coruscant was vital, and would greatly benefit perceptions of the New Republic, they disagreed on which methods were needed to secure the planet. After Noquivzor was attacked by [[Zsinj]], a former Imperial Admiral and a powerful, self-proclaimed [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]], Ackbar eventually supported Fey'lya's tactical proposals. Ackbar believed that the conquest of Coruscant needed to be hastened so the New Republic could sooner focus bringing Zsinj to justice.<ref name=\"WG\" />\n\nAs the New Republic [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|took control of Coruscant]], Ysanne Isard released a virulent plague into the planet's lower levels. While discussing the plague, Kerrithrarr suggested a militarized approach to quarantine the spread of the virus.<ref name=\"TKT\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], the New Republic senate suffered a series of bombings attributed to [[Kueller]], a former student of the [[Jedi Praxeum]] who had turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. An emergency vote to replace the delegates lost in the attacks with former Imperials was held. Senator Kerrithrarr voted in the minority, and was one of only fifteen senators to oppose the emergency elections.<ref name=\"TNR\">''[[The New Rebellion]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the ''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', authored by [[Stephen J. Sansweet]] and published by [[Del Rey]] in [[1998]], a female Wookiee named [[Kybacca]] is described as the senior Wookiee New Republic senator who opposed allowing former Imperials to serve in the senate. The ''Encyclopedia'' sources the entry to [[Kristine Kathryn Rusch]]'s [[1996]] novel, ''[[The New Rebellion]]''.<ref name=\"SWE\">''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''; {{C|\"''Kybacca''\"}} p.172</ref> However, the novel makes no mention of any Kybacca. Instead, it is Kerrithrarr who is the senior Wookiee senator, and who is one of the few senators to oppose the election of former Imperial officials to New Republic positions.<ref name=\"TNR\" /> The [[2000]] reference book ''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''<ref name=\"GtSWU3\">''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''; {{C|\"''Kybacca''\"}}</ref> and the [[2008]] compendium, ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', both reprint the ''Star Wars Encyclopedia''{{'s}} Kybacca entry.<ref name=\"CSWE2\">{{CSWECite|II|237|Kybacca}}</ref>.
