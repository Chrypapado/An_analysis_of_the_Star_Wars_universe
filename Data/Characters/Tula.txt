Tula manipulated her sister, [[Tace]], into providing the Empire with intelligence on the activities of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who was attempting to [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|rescue the survivors of Alderaan]]. Organa became aware of Tula's manipulation of Tace after Imperial forces attacked the princess while she visited the [[Alderaan Enclave]] on the [[planet]] [[Sullust]].\n\nOrgana then had Tace try and question her sister, but Tula's [[Commander|commanding officer]], [[Dreed]], realized what was happening and had Tula taken away by [[stormtrooper]]s for processing. Organa negotiated with Dreed to exchange herself for Tula on the planet [[Skaradosh]], but once there, the princess had her allies swoop in and [[Death|kill]] Dreed and his men. Tula was then reunited with her sister but found Tace angry over her betrayal. The sisters were reconciled to some extent during a battle between [[Dreed's Star Destroyer]] and the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanians gathered]] by Organa above the planet [[Espirion]], which ended in the Imperial [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|vessel's]] destruction.\n\n==Biography==\n===Betraying her people===\n{{Quote|Tula, I have to mourn ''with'' you.

You must serve her and ''Alderaan'', any way you can.|Tula persuades Tace to continue unwittingly feeding the Empire intelligence of Leia Organa's movements|Princess Leia 2}}\nThe [[human]] sisters Tula and [[Tace]] were both [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]] but chose very separate paths in life: Tula came to serve as an [[Imperial officer|officer]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] during its [[Galactic Civil War|war]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], while Tace joined the cloistered [[music]]al group known as the [[Melodic Order]] as a [[musician]].<ref name=\"Leia 2\" /> In the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]],<ref name=\"Dates\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]] to [[0 BBY]].</ref> during Tula's service to the Empire, Alderaan was [[The Disaster|destroyed]] by the Imperial [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]; however, [[Gender|she]] continued her Imperial service obediently. Tace, meanwhile, initially remained unaware of her [[homeworld]]'s fate, as her employers at [[Club Deeja]] on the planet [[Naboo]] decided their musicians would perform better without such terrible news.<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\n[[File:Tula_and_Tace_communication.png|thumb|left|200px|Tula communicated with her sister, Tace, to gain intelligence for the Empire.]]\nTula's sister finally learned the truth in the year [[0 ABY]],<ref name=\"Helmet\">{{HelmetCollectionCite|34|Highlights of the Saga|Alderaan Survives}} dates the events of the ''[[Star Wars: Princess Leia]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic series]], including Tula's appearances, to [[0 ABY]].</ref> shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]],<ref name=\"Leia 2\" /> when [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], [[Prince]]ss of Alderaan, rescued the Melodic Order from the club as part of her [[mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan]] from Imperial persecution, then invited them to join her mission. Once off Naboo and aboard Organa's [[starship]], the ''[[Lord Junn]]'', Tace used a video call to contact Tula,<ref name=\"Leia 2\" /> who was serving on the [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] of [[Commander]] [[Dreed]].<ref name=\"Leia 3\">[[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]]</ref> Unaware that her sister was an Imperial, Tace tried to arrange for the sisters to meet up and mourn, but Tula, seeing an opportunity to gain intelligence on the fugitive [[Alderaanian]]s' activity, told Tace that it was her duty to stay with Organa and aid her. She then asked that Tace contact her every [[Standard day|day]] with an update on her location and activities, so that the pair could \"keep in touch.\"<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\nTace did as Tula asked and frequently updated her on Organa's activities, letting her sister know when Organa traveled to the planet [[Sullust]] to make contact with the [[Alderaan Enclave]] located there. Tula immediately passed on the information to Dreed, who was impressed by her manipulation of Tace, but Dreed warned Tula that he was ready for her to betray him given her emotional bond with her sister. Meanwhile, on Sullust, a resident of the enclave named [[Covis]] discovered the communications between Tula and Tace and reported them to [[Preserver]] [[Jora Astane]], head of the enclave. Astane accused Organa herself of betraying the Alderaanians to the Imperials and had her chased from the enclave. As the Alderaanians tried to hunt down Organa, a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] full of [[stormtrooper]]s sent by Dreed arrived and attacked the enclave. Ultimately, Organa saved the enclave and defeated the [[trooper]]s using a herd of [[rockrender]]s, earning Astane's loyalty and escaping Sullust.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\n===A traitor revealed===\n{{Quote|<nowiki></nowiki>''Enough'', Tula. The rebels are plainly ''onto'' you.''\"<br />\"''Please commander, I can ''fix'' this&mdash;|Dreed and Tula|Princess Leia 3}}\nUnperturbed, Dreed continued to use Tula to get information from Tace; however, with the Alderaanians now aware of the siblings' communications, Tace was [[Prison|imprisoned]] by Astane and questioned by Organa. The princess believed that Tace had not known about Tula's Imperial loyalty and asked that she contact her and try to learn about her sister's location and situation.<ref name=\"Leia 4\">[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tula_and_Dreed.png|thumb|right|200px|Tula was no longer of use to Dreed once the Alderaanians saw through her lies.]]\nOnce the call began, Tula almost immediately realized something was wrong, as did Dreed, who saw that the facade was over. Despite Tula's pleas that she could fix the situation, the commander ordered that she be taken away for processing, as she was no longer of any use to him. He then turned to the communications console and accused Tace of being responsible for what was going to happen to her sister. Organa herself then took Tace's place on the video and asked the commander to consider an exchange for Tula. Dreed was initially uninterested until the princess agreed to his demands that she trade herself for Tula.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nThe exchange was arranged to take place on the [[desert]] world of [[Skaradosh]], and Dreed accompanied Tula personally aboard<ref name=\"Leia 4\" /> a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]]<ref name=\"Leia 4\" /><ref name=\"USW\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> to the planet's surface. Upon meeting with Organa, the commander questioned why Tula was so important but refused to believe the princess's claim that all Alderaanians were important enough to be worth saving. Although not satisfied with the answer, Dreed sent Tula forward to Organa's escort, while the princess crossed over to the Imperials. As the pair passed each other, Tula tried to thank Organa, but her savior only commented that Tula needed to do better in return for being saved.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" /> Before either party could return to their ships, Organa's [[Rebel pilot|pilot]], [[Evaan Verlaine]], and the [[smuggler]] [[Nien Nunb]] swooped down in the [[freighter]] ''[[Mellcrawler]]'' and opened fire on the Imperials. Dreed and his stormtrooper escort were [[Death|killed]], and Organa safely boarded the freighter alongside Tula and the other Alderaanians.<ref name=\"Leia 5\">[[Princess Leia 5|''Princess Leia'' 5]]</ref>\n\n===An unhappy reunion===\n{{Quote|I'm sorry.

The ''Mellcrawler'', meanwhile, escaped the desert world unscathed and headed for the planet [[Espirion]], where Tace and the other Alderaanians awaited them aboard the ''Lord Junn''.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\n[[File:Tace_and_Tulas_reunion.png|thumb|left|250px|Tula was overjoyed to be reunited with the sister she had betrayed.]]\nEn route, Organa was horrified to discover that Dreed's [[Star Destroyer]] was also heading for Espirion, as the Imperials were aware of the Alderaanians' presence there from intelligence Tula had previously given to Dreed. The ''Mellcrawler'' arrived at the planet first, giving the ship [[time]] to dock with the ''Lord Junn'' and allowing Tula to be reunited with her sister. The former Imperial was overjoyed to see her sibling, but the feeling was far from mutual, as Tace wanted nothing to do with her sister, whom she considered a traitor, and Tace had even shaved off her [[hair]] in order to look less like her. Tula tried to apologize and claimed that they could go back to how things were before Alderaan's destruction, but Tace stormed off, leaving her sister to try and keep up.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\nNonetheless, the sisters were soon brought together when the ''Lord Junn'' and the rest of the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanian fleet]] came under attack from Dreed's [[Star]] Destroyer as it reached Espirion. Amidst the chaos of battle, Tula and Tace clutched each other in fear, as Organa delivered what she thought might be her final speech to all those Alderaanians who fought alongside her. However, the [[fleet]] was saved when reinforcements arrived in the form of the ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', a starship sent by the [[Alder-Espirion|Alderaanian-descended]] inhabitants of Espirion, known as Alder-Espirions, after they heard Organa's passionate speech. Their combined forces then destroyed the Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Splendid work, Tula.

She went so far as to manipulate her own sister to gain intelligence for Commander Dreed concerning the movements of Organa, princess of Alderaan. Despite this obedience, Dreed still expected the [[officer]]'s betrayal, as Tula scored low on tests for loyalty to the Empire and still clearly loved her sister.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\nUltimately, Tula did not have a chance to betray the Empire, as Dreed decided her usefulness had run out once the Alderaanians realized she was manipulating Tace. When Organa saved Tula from the Imperials, she attempted to thank the princess<ref name=\"Leia 4\" /> and, upon being reunited with Tace, tried to apologize for what she had done. She hoped that her and Tace's relationship could return to what it was before her betrayal, but Tace expressed uncertainty in their reconciliation.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nWhile serving the Empire, Tula wore a standard gray [[Imperial military uniforms|Imperial officer's uniform]].<ref name=\"Leia 2\" /> Sometimes, when contacting Tace under the guise of being off duty, she wore a black [[Clothing|outfit]] instead.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTula first appeared in the [[Princess Leia 2|second issue]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Princess Leia]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] mini-series,<ref name=\"Leia 2\" /> going on to appear in all remaining issues of the run.
