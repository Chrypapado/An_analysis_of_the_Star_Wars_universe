Nahkee was stolen by [[Morag]]. She framed the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] by placing Ewok hoods, bows and arrows at the scene of the abduction so that the infants parents would think that the Ewoks were responsible and seek revenge. Morag made the [[Dulok/Legends|Duloks]] take care of Nahkee while the [[Phlog/Legends|Phlog]] parents attacked the Ewoks.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Ewoks|Rampage of the Phlogs}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[File:Phlog_family.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Nahkee with his family.]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Nahkee\n}}\n\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Phlogs]]"}}}]}}}}
