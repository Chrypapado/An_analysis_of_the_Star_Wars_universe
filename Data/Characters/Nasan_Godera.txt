I refuse to serve such monumental ignorance.|Dr. Godera|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] '''Nasan Godera''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] who worked for the [[Republic Strategic Information Service]], the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] intelligence agency, during the [[Great Galactic War]] with the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]]. Born on [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]] in [[3707 BBY]], Godera was a brilliant scientist whose arrogance nearly crippled his career until he began aiding the Republic's war effort, and he soon became involved in the [[Shadow Arsenal]] project under [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Laren Omas]]. After the project was discontinued, Godera completed the weapons in secret but realized their destructive potential was too great, and he founded the [[Republic superweapon initiative]] to create weapons to protect the Republic and destroy the Empire. As head of the SIS's [[Advanced Development Laboratories]], Godera trained a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in [[Boab Deduun]], and was outraged when the Republic submitted to the Empire's demands in the [[Treaty of Coruscant]]. The fiercely patriotic Godera abandoned the Republic in protest and went into exile on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], constructing a series of underground labs manned by [[Droid/Legends|droid]] assistants.\n\nHowever, Godera became the target of an [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]] operation almost a decade into the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] when the agents of [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Angral]] attempted to capture the scientist for his knowledge of [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapons]]. A [[Hero of Tython|young Jedi Knight]] was sent to [[Mission to Taris (Desolator crisis)|retrieve]] the doctor before the Empire could capture him, and the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] managed to rescue Godera after pursuing his captor, [[Watcher One]] of Imperial Intelligence, across the ruined world. Godera returned to the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to aid the Republic during the [[Desolator crisis|campaign]] against Angral, and his knowledge proved invaluable in deactivating the [[Desolator (Imperial-class)/Legends|Desolator]] weapon aboard Angral's ship [[Oppressor (Harrower-class)|''Oppressor'']]. He remained assigned to [[General/Legends|General]] [[Var Suthra]] of the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]] as a scientific advisor as the [[Galactic War]] began, and he helped halt the [[Sith/Legends|Sith's]] efforts to [[Death/Legends|kill]] civilians during the [[Battle of Corellia]]. Godera was killed during an Imperial attack, though his inventions would continue to be utilized by the military and the SIS during the renewed war.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and the war===\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]] in [[3707 BBY]],<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Nasan Godera quickly became known for his genius intellect as a young man. Godera's abrasive personality and political insensitivity nearly doomed his career as a scientist in the years before the [[Great Galactic War]], but when the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|resurgent Sith Empire]] returned in [[3681 BBY]] and began to attack the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Godera was recruited into the [[Republic Strategic Information Service]], the Republic's intelligence agency.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Not long after the [[Battle of Alderaan]] in [[3667 BBY]], [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] Godera was one of many scientists recruited by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Laren Omas]] of the Republic's nascent [[Republic Special Forces Division|Special Forces]]. Omas convinced the group to design a weapon capable of stopping the Imperial threat, and over the course of several weeks the scientists developed a plan to build a \"[[Shadow Arsenal]]\"&mdash;a stockpile of interplanetary missiles with [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking devices]] and payloads capable of destroying entire continents, intended to serve as an incredible deterrent against further Imperial hostility.<ref name=\"Shadow Arsenal\">{{TORcite|type=codex|The Shadow Arsenal (Agent)}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the group began to fall apart soon after the plan was finalized, and Omas's [[Death/Legends|death]] at the [[Battle of Hoth (Great Galactic War)|Battle of Hoth]] in [[3665 BBY]] caused the group to officially disband. But a determined Godera continued to secretly build the arsenal on the [[adrenal]]-producing world of [[Quesh]], and it was not until he completed the weapon that Godera realized that the weapon's destructive potential was too much. Understanding that the catastrophic death toll the weapon would incur was too high a price, Godera locked the Shadow Arsenal away on Quesh and swore that from that day for his inventions would be different&mdash;they would either imprison or selectively target enemies, or guard against attack.<ref name=\"Shadow Arsenal\" /> After spending four [[Standard year/Legends|years]] studying the technology of the ancient [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] [[Species/Legends|species]] on the prison world of [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]], Godera founded the [[Republic superweapon initiative]] to develop new technologies and weapons.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" />\n\nGodera soon became the Chief Designer within the Republic's [[Advanced Development Laboratories]], developing prototype technologies and working with the galaxy's greatest [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]]. Fellow scientist [[Boab Deduun]] became Godera's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and Godera's genius eventually led to the creation of multiple [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapons]] and advanced technologies. Among his inventions were the [[Sky Torch]] weapon and the [[spy ray]], a long-range surveillance device that every SIS agent knew how to build by the time of the Cold War.<ref name=\"Lost Suns 3\">''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 3]]''</ref>. Several superweapons&mdash;including the [[Planet Prison]], [[Power Guard Enhancement System]], [[Shock Drum]], and the [[Death Mark laser]]&mdash;were developed years later from Godera's half-finished designs and research.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" />\n\n===Self-exile===\nIn [[3653 BBY]], the Republic was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Coruscant]] and end the war on the Empire's terms.<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{TORweb|url=holonet/galactic-history|text=Timeline 1: Treaty of Coruscant|int=Timeline 1: Treaty of Coruscant}}</ref> This infuriated Godera, whose devotion to the destruction of the Empire led him to protest the Treaty. After the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] repeatedly ignored his advice and predictions that the Empire would press their advantage, Godera left the Republic in disgust and traveled to the ruined world of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. There, he constructed a series of underground laboratories with the help of [[Droid/Legends|droid]] assistants, and the scientist continued his research and experiments over the next decade as [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] experienced the tense [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]. The droid [[RE-M0]] became one of Godera's favorite assistants.<ref name=\"The Architect of Annihilation\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|The Architect of Annihilation|Taris}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Godera_trapped.png|thumb|Godera imprisoned by Imperials on Taris]]\nIn [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"Time\">{{TOR_dates|1}}</ref> the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Angral]] declared a [[Desolator crisis|personal war]] upon the Republic and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] in response to the [[Death/Legends|death]] of his son [[Tarnis (Sith Lord)|Tarnis]] at the hands of a [[Hero of Tython|young Jedi Knight]]. Tarnis had been posing as a member of the Republic superweapon initiative&mdash;which had been reorganized following Godera's resignation under [[General/Legends|General]] [[Var Suthra]] with the purpose of weaponizing the technologies Godera had developed&mdash;and he sent all of his files on the Republic's weapons projects to Angral before his death. Tarnis also communicated the rumors that Doctor Godera had gone into hiding on Taris, and the Sith Empire's [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]] confirmed this, as they had been tracking Godera's whereabouts for quite some time.<ref name=\"The Architect of Annihilation\" />\n\nAngral therefore ordered [[Watcher One]] of Intelligence to take a force of [[Imperial soldier]]s to Taris and capture the scientist, and Watcher One's forces began to attack and capture Godera's laboratories across Taris.<ref name=\"The Architect of Annihilation\" /> Imperial forces eventually located and captured the doctor, knocking him unconscious<ref name=\"Rescue\" /> and bringing Godera to Watcher One in the Imperial-occupied ruins of the [[Taris ChemWorks Factory]]. However, Godera's interrogation was prevented by the impending arrival of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who had killed Tarnis; the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] had been sent by General Suthra to rescue Godera, and was tracking Godera's biosignature with the help of RE-M0. To evade the Knight, Watcher One donned a [[Holoprojector/Legends|holoprojector]] that disguised him as a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] and carried the unconscious doctor to the factory's entrance, where Watcher One tricked the arriving Jedi into letting them leave;<ref name=\"Catching Up\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Catching Up With Watcher One|Taris}}</ref> the Imperial operative then took Godera to a secure base in the depths of the ruined transport hub known as [[Transport Station 5]].<ref name=\"Rescue\" />\n\nThe still unconscious scientist was then injected with a class-four truth serum, which allowed the Imperials to easily interrogate Godera and mine his knowledge of advanced weaponry and technology. Once the interrogation was complete, Watcher One sent the data to Darth Angral just as the Jedi Knight who was pursuing Godera arrived.<ref name=\"Rescue\" />\n\n{{GameLS}}\nStill strapped to the interrogation table, Godera witnessed the Knight's [[Raid on the Imperial Intelligence Outpost|fight]] with Watcher One, after which the Knight allowed the defeated agent to flee and make a new life for himself outside of the Empire.<ref name=\"Rescue\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\nThe Jedi then freed Godera from his restraints, and the doctor begrudgingly agreed to return to the Republic when he was informed of Angral's crusade. Godera was escorted by the Knight back to the Republic settlement of [[Olaris]], where the Jedi delivered the scientist into the custody of [[Agent/Legends|Agent]] [[Fau-Kes]] of the SIS; Fau-Kes and his team then escorted Godera to Coruscant,<ref name=\"Rescue\" /> where Godera was appointed as General Suthra's scientific advisor during the crisis with Angral.<ref name=\"The Shock Drum\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|The Shock Drum|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\n===Return to war===\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Godera.png|thumb|left|Doctor Godera during the Galactic War]]\nNasan Godera was an expert in mathematics and loved calculating problems in his head. He preferred the companionship with droids over organics.\n\nLike many in the Republic, Godera despised the Empire and was so outraged at the Treaty of Coruscant, that he retired and hid on Taris. However, he was willing to return after seeing that the Republic finally acknowledged the Empire as a threat.\n\nGodera had an indifferent, casual outlook on life and viewed the weapons such as the [[Shock Drum]] to be fascinating designs, not even caring about its potential to destroy planets. He also had a close friendship with General Var Suthra and had confidence in his abilities, so much so that he was more than willing to stand in the middle of a war zone on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], believing that the General's best troops would protect him and that no one would intentionally target a museum. Unfortunately, this proved to be his undoing when the Sith killed him.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNasan Godera was first mentioned in the [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] ''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 3]]'', an issue in the [[Star Wars: The Old Republic, The Lost Suns|''Lost Suns'']] arc of the [[Star Wars: The Old Republic (comics)|tie-in comic series]] for the [[BioWare]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''. Godera went on to appear in the game itself as a supporting character for the Jedi Knight class storyline, and was also mentioned frequently in the Imperial Agent storyline and other missions on Taris. The [[2012]] reference guide ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]'' sheds further light on his career, and Godera received his own entry in the guide's section on the Strategic Information Service. The timing of Doctor Godera's work with the Shadow Arsenal is a source of confusion; the Imperial Agent storyline states that the Shadow Arsenal project officially ended with the Battle of Hoth, but claims that the battle occurred at the end of the Great War, despite all previous sources and other parts of the game stating that occurred in [[3665 BBY]]. As a result, this article assumes that the Shadow Arsenal dating is a error.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 3]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nasan Godera\n|ru=\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Godera, Nasan}}\n[[Category:Balmorrans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Republic Strategic Information Service personnel]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
