I hear you're looking to sell your gun.|Elea Poista as Kel|Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin}}\n'''Elea Poista''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] and senior [[Exex]] of [[Bespin Motors/Legends|Bespin Motors]]' shipping department. Under the alias \"Kel,\" Poista sold weapons on the black market during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nElea Poista was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]].<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> Originally working for a shipping company on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]],<ref name=\"GG2-2\">[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]</ref> she transferred to [[Bespin Motors/Legends|Bespin Motors]] on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], becoming a top [[Exex]] in the company's shipping department.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> The move was purely financial; for [[Standard year/Legends|years]], Poista had been operating as an arms dealer named \"Kel,\" and the move to Bespin Motors was to secure shipping resources to serve her clients. The Kel identity was painstakingly created by Poista; Kel had birth records indicating a [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Galltine]], job history in the [[Hammo job corp]], docking passes to multiple [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceports]], and a presence in both [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] and Cloud City records.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\nWhile working for Bespin Motors, Poista was in charge of contracting [[Molly's Merchants]] to stage a buyout of [[Bespin Motors/Legends|Bespin Motors]] from their parent company, [[Incom Corporation/Legends|Incom Corporation]]. Molly's Merchants transferred funds from Incom to Bespin Motors, allowing them to buy themselves out as an independent company. However, while tracking down Molly's Merchants, Poista learned just how much crime the Empire created. Her realization led her to shift her business dealings to favor the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]].<ref name=\"GG2-2\" /> Poista's new goal was to hurt the Empire and aid the Rebellion in any way possible, and she used her connections to secure weapons to sell to the Alliance. Although rumored to sell to highest bidder, Poista maintained Imperial and criminal connections solely to funnel new Imperial technology to the Rebellion.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\nFollowing the evacuation of Cloud City in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Poista led a Rebel cell in the metropolis, and sought to protect [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian's]] secrets contained in the [[central computer]]. She was assisted by a [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], [[Dee Fourpio]], and the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]] [[Tristos Arctura]].<ref name=\"GMLA\">''[[Gamemaster Toolkit: Live-Action Adventures]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nElea Poista stood 1.7 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] tall,<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> and had long,<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />[[Color/Legends|red]] hair which she wore in bun.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nPoista was skilled with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], and was well-versed in [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucratic]] procedure<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> and business practices, especially relating to Bespin Motors.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nPoista carried a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] and [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]].<ref name=\"GG2-2\" /> In her Kel persona, Poista wore a black wig and dressed in a black [[Jumpsuit/Legends|jumpsuit]] and [[Cape/Legends|cape]].<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Gamemaster Toolkit: Live-Action Adventures]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poista, Elea}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Arms dealers]]\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
