As a thief, he worked for the [[Hutt Clan]] out of [[Mos Espa]] on [[Tatooine]], where he was present for the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing|podrace]] in [[32 BBY]] that was won by [[Anakin Skywalker]]. During the age of the Empire, Weazel worked with [[Enfys Nest]] and her [[Cloud-Riders]], who sought to fight back against the [[crime lord]]s who had wronged them as well as the Empire. He was Nest's best [[lieutenant]] and most vigilant [[spy]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Life as a thief===\n[[File:Wattomocks.png|thumb|left|250px|Weazel sat and cheered alongside Watto during the Boonta Eve Classic in 32 BBY.]]\nWeazel was [[Homeworld|from]] the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]],<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars NE\" /> where he worked as a [[thief]] for the ruling [[Hutt Clan]] in the [[spaceport]] settlement of [[Mos Espa]]<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> in [[32 BBY]].<ref name=\"Episode I date\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], which includes the [[Boonta Eve Classic]], to [[32 BBY]].</ref> During the time of the [[Trade Federation]]{{'s}} [[Invasion of Naboo]], Weazel attended the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing|podrace]] in Mos Espa where he sat with [[Watto]], a [[Toydarian]] junk dealer who placed a large sum of money on the reigning champion [[Sebulba]] to win.

And the war has just begun.|Enfys Nest|audio=Enfys-Allies.ogg|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}\n[[File:K21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Weazel, with his K21c portable ordinance launcher.]]\nBy the time the Empire was in power, Weazel had left behind his life as a thief and joined the [[Cloud-Riders]], a group of vigilante marauders led by [[Enfys Nest]].<ref name=\"Solo Official Guide\" /> While rivals such as [[Tobias Beckett]] believed them to be pirate thieves, they were actually aspiring rebels who wanted to fight for and bring justice to those who had been victimized by the Empire and the criminal syndicates that ran rampant in [[the galaxy]], such as [[Crimson Dawn]].<ref name=\"Solo\" /> Weazel became Nest's most trusted [[lieutenant]] and vigilant [[spy]],<ref name=\"Solo Official Guide\" /> and together they and the Cloud-Riders had numerous run-ins with Beckett and his [[Beckett's gang|crew]], who often worked for Crimson Dawn.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\nIn [[11 BBY]], Weazel accompanied Nest, [[Callixido Ryss]] and [[Moda Maxa]] to [[Gargon]] to [[Raid on Gargon|raid]] an Imperial [[spice]] [[Imperial medical spice cache|cache]] in order to retrieve medicinally processed [[spice]]. The raid was ultimately successful and the obtained spice was segmented into ready-to-implement triage kits and emergency packs, but they left the raw spice behind even though they could have stolen it to refine it for narcotic usage and make a fortune by selling it. This action left [[Agent]] [[Andressa Divo]] of the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] surprised, who noted that the Cloud-Riders were likely building an [[army]] and readying to go to war.<ref name=\"Scum and Villainy\">''[[Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious]]''</ref>\n\nThe Cloud-Riders last run-in with Beckett's gang, however, took place in [[10 BBY]],<ref name=\"Solo Official Guide\" /> when the Cloud-Riders caught wind of a [[Heist on Vandor|heist]] Beckett and his team were pulling on [[Vandor]] for Crimson Dawn. While Beckett, his partner [[Val]], [[pilot]] [[Rio Durant]], and newcomers [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] attempted to steal the hyperfuel known as [[coaxium]] from an Imperial [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport|conveyex train]], the Cloud-Riders attacked on [[Swoop|swoop bikes]] and attempted to steal the loot for themselves. The resulting encounter led to some Cloud-Rider casualties as well as the deaths of Val and Durant. Neither team was able to steal the loot; as each attempted to take the train car carrying the coaxium for themselves, the pilot Solo detached the car from the [[Y-45 armored transport hauler|AT-hauler]] he was flying and it crashed into a mountain. Weazel and the others survived the resulting massive explosion of hyperfuel, and each went their separate ways.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n[[File:Enfys_Nest_and_company.png|thumb|left|250px|Weazel and the Cloud-Riders, on Savareen.]]\nBeckett arranged a new operation with Crimson Dawn to steal coaxium from the [[Spice mines of Kessel|spice mines]] of [[Kessel]], an operation the Cloud-Riders also caught wind of. Weazel followed Beckett's team as they met with [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] and arranged for him and his [[YT-1300 light freighter|ship]], the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', to help them make the Kessel Run in enough time to bring the stolen unrefined coaxium to [[Savareen]] for refinement. Having learned that Calrissian was part of the operation, Weazel placed a tracking device on the ''Millennium Falcon'' so the Cloud-Riders could keep tabs on where Beckett and his team were ultimately headed.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\nThe Cloud-Riders confronted Beckett's gang once they arrived on Savareen, and they engaged in a brief standoff. Nest ultimately explained the true motives of the Cloud-Riders, presenting Beckett's team with a choice about whether to hand the coaxium over to Crimson Dawn or allow the Cloud-Riders to take it and use the millions of [[credit]]s to attain their goals. As such, Solo and [[Qi'ra]] ended up killing [[Dryden Vos]] and a traiterous Beckett in the result. Due to the actions and help of Han Solo, the Cloud-Riders were able to acquire the coaxium. Weazel secured it their transports as Nest told Solo what they wanted it for: to fuel a rebellion.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Weazel_SWCT.png|thumb|right|200px|Weazel wearing his Cloud-Rider armor]]\nWeazel was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] with [[Color|brown]] [[hair]], blue [[eye]]s, and light skin. Weazel, who stood shorter than most humans,<ref name=\"Solo\" /> was once a common criminal for one of the five major crime syndicates but ultimately turned against them and believed in bringing justice to those throughout the [[galaxy]] who had been hurt by the syndicates and the Empire. As part of his operations, he carried a [[K21c portable ordnance launcher]] from [[Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc.|Merr-Sonn Munitions]] and wore a [[Kalevalan tracker helmet]] that was equipped with a [[rangefinder]]<ref name=\"Solo Official Guide\" /> and a device that enabled him to communicate with Nest.<ref name=\"Stickers>''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Ultimate Sticker Collection]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|When we saw him in ''The Phantom Menace'' I think he was going off the rails a little but he was gambling and getting in the wrong crowd. I like to think that he maybe perhaps started to think 'well I need to do something good with my life.' and then started flying with a cause and that's when he joined Enfys Nest and got involved in that group.
