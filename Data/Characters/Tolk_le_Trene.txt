At RMSU-7, le Trene served under Vondar,<ref name=\"BS1\" /> who was a [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] and [[Chief medical officer|Chief Surgeon]], as well as a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]] named [[D'Arc Vaetes]], who commanded the medical facility. The world of Drongar was an unpleasant place for the Republic forces stationed there, with powerful electrical storms, high temperatures, and high [[Water/Legends|humidity]].<ref name=\"BS2\" />\n\nDuring the [[Time/Legends|time]] le Trene was stationed on Drongar, the planet was the stage of a fierce battle between the Republic<ref name=\"BS1\" /> and the Confederacy, who were both fighting for control of the [[bota]] fields on the world. Bota was a rare type of [[Plant/Legends|plant]] that could be made into a drug that had many uses, both medicinal and otherwise.<ref name=\"BS2\" /> While at RMSU-7, le Trene served with not only Vondar, but also several other individuals including an [[Equani]] [[Minder (occupation)|minder]] named [[Klo Merit]] and a [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] surgeon named [[Zan Yant]], who became friends with Vondar at the facility.<ref name=\"BS1\" /> At some point during her time at RMSU-7, le Trene became attracted to Vondar,<ref name=\"TCSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|251|le Trene, Tolk}}</ref> although she did not make her feelings immediately obvious to him.<ref name=\"BS18\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]''', Chapter 18</ref> The fighting on Drongar required le Trene and Vondar to operate on a large number of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], who were all genetically identical. The [[Cloning/Legends|clones]] were brought to the [[Medcenter/Legends|medcenter]] from the battlefield using [[Medlifter troop transport|medlifter]] [[Transport/Legends|transports]], and there le Trene would assist Vondar during surgery. Frequently, the surgeons would have very little time in between the arrival of new wounded [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] due to the heavy fighting.<ref name=\"BS1\" />\n\nTolk le Trene and Vondar frequently had to deal with malfunctioning medical equipment during surgery, which forced them to use less technologically advanced methods, as they did while performing surgery on troopers injured in a [[Battle of Poptree Forest|battle]] in [[Poptree Forest]].<ref name=\"BS1\" /> Soon after the battle, a [[Mirialan/Legends|Mirialan]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] and [[Jedi healer/Legends|healer]] named [[Barriss Offee/Legends|Barriss Offee]] arrived at RMSU-7 to join the staff there shortly before more wounded clone troopers arrived for le Trene and the other surgeons and nurses to treat.<ref name=\"BS2\" /> Soon afterward, le Trene, Vondar, and Yant showed the new arrival around the base including the facility's [[Rimsoo Seven cantina|cantina]], a place where many of surgeons and nurses went to unwind when they were off-duty. There the four met [[Den Dhur]], a [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Journalist/Legends|reporter]]<ref name=\"BS4\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 4</ref> who came to the table due to the presence of a Jedi.<ref name=\"BS3\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 3</ref> After the Jedi arrived, the facility continued to receive many seriously wounded troops from the battle, forcing le Trene and the others to work long shifts, although Offee was able to aid them by [[Force power/Legends|using]] [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] some of the injured.<ref name=\"BS6\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 6</ref>\n\n===Love and war===\nAs the battle continued to rage, Klo Merit, who was secretly working for the Confederacy, [[Saboteur/Legends|sabotaged]] a [[Unidentified bota transport (Klo Merit)|transport]] that was carrying bota to be taken off the planet. Tolk le Trene was one of many individuals who noticed the bright flash that occurred when the transport exploded in midair.<ref name=\"BS7\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 7</ref> Around the time of the sabotage, le Trene and Vondar's surgical ward was able to keep eighty-seven percent of their patients alive. Vondar also developed an attraction for le Trene, but was reluctant to pursue it further due to his [[Ensterite]] background, which prohibited him from [[Marriage/Legends|marrying]] anyone not born in the [[Corellian system]]. Near that time, instead of supplying the surgical staff with [[Medical droid/Legends|medical droids]], the Republic sent the surgical staff a [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] with the designation [[I-5YQ]], which Vondar assigned to data storage and secretarial duties.<ref name=\"BS10\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 10</ref> During a period of particularly fierce fighting, le Trene and the rest of the medical staff at RMSU-7 were overwhelmed with severely wounded clone troopers, many of which died. At that time, I-5YQ helped le Trene and Offee with their work in determining the treatment priority for troopers by attaching a priority label to each one.<ref name=\"BS13\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 13</ref> Several days later, while drinking with Vondar and Yant with Offee present as well, le Trene witnessed Den Dhur's revelation of a [[Holorecorder/Legends|holorecording]] that showed a Republic combat instructor named [[Phow Ji]] kill three separatist [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] with his [[Unarmed combat|bare hands]], an act which Yant and Offee viewed as murder.<ref name=\"BS14\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 14</ref>\n\nAround that time,<ref name=\"BS18\" /> Tolk le Trene started to let Jos Vondar know that she was attracted to him<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> by doing things like leaving the in use diode off to the surgery's dressing room so that Vondar would accidentely walk in on her while was changing [[Clothing/Legends|clothes]]. However, Vondar thought that she had merely discerned his own attraction to her and was having fun by embarrassing him.<ref name=\"BS18\" /> While stationed at RMSU-7, le Trene sometimes played [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]], a card game, with Den Dhur, I-5YQ, Klo Merit, Barriss Offee, Jos Vondar, and Zan Yant.<ref name=\"BS20\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 20</ref> Besides the usual surgical work, another important event occurred at RMSU-7 around the same time. Klo Merit, although working for the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] criminal organization instead of the Confederacy, used [[Poison/Legends|poison]] to kill the base's [[Quartermaster/Legends|quartermaster]], a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] named [[Filba]], due to the Hutt's greed in [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] bota for the organization.<ref name=\"BS27\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 27</ref> The murder caused quite a bit of commotion in the camp, and required le Trene's friend, Jos Vondar, to perform an [[autopsy]] to determine how the Hutt died.<ref name=\"BS24\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 24</ref>\n\n[[File:Tolk_le_Trene.jpg|thumb|right|200px|le Trene tends to a wounded [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone trooper]]]]\nDuring her service there she met and fell in love with [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] surgeon [[Jos Vondar]].<ref name=\"BS\" /> le Trene was briefly suspected as being a saboteur by [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Barriss Offee/Legends|Barriss Offee]] as she had been onboard the [[MedStar-class frigate/Legends|MedStar]] frigate at Drongar at the time of an explosion and afterward her attitude towards Vondar became more distant.<ref name=\"JH\">''[[MedStar II: Jedi Healer]]''</ref> However le Trene's coldness was due to the fact that she had learned Vondar would lose his position if she continued their relationship. She had needed an opportunity to think, and this was perceived by Offee when le Trene opened her mind to the Jedi.<ref name=\"JH\" />\n\nDespite his people's traditions barring marriage to offworlders, Vondar brought her to his [[Corellia/Legends|homeworld]] after the cessation of [[Battle of Drongar|fighting]] on Drongar. Accompanying them on their journey was Vondar's great-uncle, Admiral [[Erel Kersos]].<ref name=\"JH\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAlthough a Lorrdian, le Trene was essentially a baseline Human both genetically and physically.<ref name=\"BS3\" /> She had fair skin and shoulder-length [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] that she frequently wore pulled back using a scarf.<ref name=\"Intermezzo\" /> Jos Vondar found le Trene to be physically attractive. During her time of Drongar, she sometimes wore a musky, yet fresh scent that Vondar found to be nice.<ref name=\"BS10\" /> When the surgical ward was overwhelmed with severely wounded troopers, sometimes le Trene was emotionally affected by the suffering and loss of life.<ref name=\"BS13\" /> Tolk le Trene was not opposed to drinking [[Alcohol/Legends|alcohol]], which she sometimes imbibed with Vondar, Den Dhur, and Zan Yant.<ref name=\"BS14\" />\n\n===Relationships===\n====Jos Vondar====\nAlthough she was attracted to Jos Vondar,<ref name=\"BS\" /> Tolk le Trene found it amusing when she observed the Corellian looking at Barriss Offee, RMSU-7's new Jedi arrival.<ref name=\"BS4\" /> Although Vondar found her attractive, he initially did not want to have a relationship with her due to his Ensterite upbringing, which forbade him to marry anyone not born in his home system. Using her ability to read body language, she was able to tell that something was bothering Jos Vondar, but he initially refused to mention that he was lonely or that he was attracted to her.<ref name=\"BS10\" /> Eventually, le Trene took matters into her own hands and let Vondar know that she was attracted do him<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> by doing such things as leaving the in use diode off on the surgery's changing room so that Vondar would see her partially undressed.<ref name=\"BS18\" /> She also did her best to cheer him up when he was depressed by his work and the war.<ref name=\"BS19\">''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', Chapter 19</ref>\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nAs a Lorrdian, Tolk le Trene was able to sense the mood of nearby [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] individuals from their expressions and body language with ease.<ref name=\"BS10\" /> In her duties as a scrub nurse, le Trene was trained both to diagnose injuries and use various pieces of equipment.<ref name=\"BS1\" /> At some times during the battle on Drongar, she was able to determine which trooper's injuries were too severe for survival, and also what priority and treatment should be given to those who could still be saved.<ref name=\"BS13\" />\n\nShe was trained in the use of both [[pressor generator]]s and the more primitive [[hemostat]]s to stop [[Blood/Legends|bleeding]] in a surgical patient.<ref name=\"BS1\" /> She was also able to pump [[vascolution]] into a patient,<ref name=\"BS6\" /> utilize a [[hemosponge]] to clear an [[antisepsis field]], as well as use a handheld [[Bioscan/Legends|bioscanner]].<ref name=\"BS1\" />\n\nIn her basic weapons tests, she scored the [[Master (rating)|\"master\"]] rating with [[Pulse rifle/Legends|pulse rifles]], while earning the lower rank of [[Sharpshooter (rating)|\"sharpshooter\"]] with [[Blaster pistol/Legends|sidearm blasters]].<ref name=\"BS19\" /> While playing sabacc, le Trene was able to keep her face calm to keep from betraying the type of hand that she held. Den Dhur believed that her skill at reading people would give her an edge in the game, although not as much as great as the advantage that could be gained by Offee or Merit.<ref name=\"BS20\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTolk le Trene was created as one of the main characters for ''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'', a [[2004]] novel written by [[Steve Perry]] and [[Michael Reaves]] as part of the [[Clone Wars multimedia project|''Clone Wars'' multimedia project]] and as the first part of the ''[[MedStar Duology]]''.<ref name=\"BS\" /> Later that year, le Trene again had a major role in ''[[MedStar II: Jedi Healer]]'', the concluding novel of the duology written by Perry and Reaves.<ref name=\"JH\" /> In [[2005]], Tolk le Trene appeared in \"''[[MedStar: Intermezzo]]''\", a short story written by Perry and Reaves that took place chronologically between the two ''MedStar'' novels. In the story, le Trene received her first pictoral depiction, which was created by [[Randy Martinez]]. \"''MedStar: Intermezzo''\" was originally published in ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' [[Star Wars Insider 83|''83'']]<ref name=\"Intermezzo\" /> but was later released on [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|''Hyperspace'']] in [[2008]], before its closure in [[2011]].<ref name=\"Hyperspace\">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/fiction/f20080311/index.html|text=\"''MedStar: Intermezzo''\"|int=MedStar: Intermezzo}}</ref> In [[2012]], she was featured in the ''MedStar'' entry in ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'', a reference book written by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] that detailed ''[[Star Wars]]'' novels and short fiction in chronological order.
