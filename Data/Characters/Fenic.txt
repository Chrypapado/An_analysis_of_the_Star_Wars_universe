It was then that Fenic demonstrated the depth of his loyalty to Dunlan.\n\nFenic had planned to kill Dunlan and then collect the sizable [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] that the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] had placed on his head. He managed to aim his [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] at Dunlan but when the time came to pull the trigger he hesitated&mdash;even when Dunlan encouraged him to do it.
