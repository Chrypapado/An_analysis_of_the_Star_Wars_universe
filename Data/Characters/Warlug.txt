When the message of Jabba's [[Death/Legends|death]] reached the palace, [[Yarna d'al' Gargan/Legends|Yarna d'al' Gargan]] ran across the two drunks, who attempted to rape her in their befuddlement. Fortunately, [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Doallyn/Legends|Doallyn]] arrived just in time to protect her before they could commit their heinous act. He shot the Gamorrean in the back and escaped with Yarna into the [[Desert/Legends|desert]]. Warlug was lucky to survive the incident and backed off with Tornik.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Skin Deep: The Fat Dancer's Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{StarWarsKidsCite|8|Who Is That Alien?}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Warlug\n}}\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
