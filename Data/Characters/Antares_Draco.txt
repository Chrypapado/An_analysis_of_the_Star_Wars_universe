But I will obey.|Roan Fel and Antares Draco|Legacy (2006) 3}}\n'''Antares Draco''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who led the [[Imperial Knight]]s during the [[Second Imperial Civil War]]. A skilled [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|duelist]], Draco was fiercely loyal to and willing to [[Death/Legends|die]] for [[Roan Fel]], [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] of the [[Fel Empire|Galactic Empire]] and later the [[Empire-in-exile]]. Draco was trained in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by Master [[Darth Havok|Eshkar Niin]], and was an Imperial Knight as early as [[130 ABY]] at the [[Battle of Caamas|conclusion]] of the [[Sith&ndash;Imperial War]], when he fled the [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial capital]] with Fel as the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Krayt]] [[Attack on Emperor Fel|seized control]] of the Empire and [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], declaring a [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|new order]] and driving Fel's forces into [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]]. When Eshkar Niin deserted the Imperial Knights, Draco was sent to kill him and [[Rooftop duel|left him]] mortally wounded after Niin murdered Fel's wife, the Empress [[Elliah Fel|Elliah]]. Draco continued to serve the Emperor, eventually becoming an Imperial Knight Master and the leader of the Order. In [[137 ABY]], he accompanied Fel as the Emperor [[Fall of Bastion|retook]] the [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] and established a [[fortress world]] from which he could assault Krayt's forces.\n\nWhen Draco learned that Fel's daughter [[Marasiah Fel|Marasiah]] was being pursued by Krayt's [[One Sith|Sith]] agents on [[Vendaxa/Legends|Vendaxa]], he defied the Emperor's orders to not mount a rescue attempt, and brought his trusted friend [[Ganner Krieg]] to the world in an attempt to [[Skirmish on Vendaxa|rescue]] the woman he loved from the [[Sith/Legends|Sith's]] clutches. Escaping the planet on the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']], a [[Starship/Legends|ship]] belonging to the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Cade Skywalker]], Draco and Krieg were able to return the [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] to Bastion, but at the expense of their Emperor's trust. Draco hoped to win enough of Fel's trust back to persuade the Emperor to allow him to [[Marriage/Legends|marry]] the Princess, and grew very staunch in his willingness to obey orders. Over the next several [[Standard month/Legends|months]], he and Krieg were sent on missions to [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]] and to the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order's]] [[Hidden Temple (Sith&ndash;Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]] on [[Taivas]]. While at the Temple, they joined a strike team put together by Skywalker to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt on [[Had Abbadon/Legends|Had Abbadon]]. The [[Mission to Had Abbadon|mission]] saw Krayt [[Battle on Had Abbadon|nearly killed]], but the war continued to rage on. Draco later accompanied Fel to [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] along with several other Imperial Knights in order to conduct [[Mission to Agamar|peace talks]] with the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Order, but the meeting was [[Operation: Thunderstroke|interrupted]] by forces of the One Sith.\n\nDraco ordered the Emperor's escape [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] to ferry Fel away from Agamar and to safety, although it meant leaving Marasiah behind. The Princess was captured by the Sith, and Draco later led a [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|rescue mission]] on the Sith world of [[Korriban]]. The mission was successful, but Draco remained onworld to buy her time to escape. There, he was taken [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] by Niin, who had become the [[Sith Inquisitor]] Darth Havok, and Havok subjected him to agonizing [[Torture/Legends|torture]] in an effort to learn the Emperor's secrets. Draco broke under the torture and told Havok about the Jedi's Hidden Temple. He was then [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|frozen]] in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and made into a gift for Cade Skywalker, whom Darth Krayt wanted to entice into a confrontation. Skywalker brought Draco to the Temple, and the two joined in its [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|defense]] as Krayt's forces attacked. The Jedi were evacuated, and Fel and his [[Alliance (Second Imperial Civil War)|allies]] immediately launched a [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|counterstrike]] at Sith-controlled Coruscant. During the battle, Draco stood aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Jagged Fel (starship)|''Jagged Fel'']] at the side of the Emperor, who yet believed in Draco's unquestioning loyalty. Draco's loyalty was ultimately to the Force, however, and he held true to his oath as an Imperial Knight and slew his liege during the battle when the Emperor fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and attempted to unleash a deadly [[Omega Red|pathogen]] onto Coruscant's surface.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the One Sith, a new galactic government known as the [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]] came into existence. Marasiah Fel became the new Empress while Draco became the head of the Imperial Knights. The Triumvirate's efforts to rebuild the galaxy were stymied by an underground One Sith insurgency and the appearance of a rogue Sith, named [[Darth Wredd]], who wanted to destroy the One Sith and restore the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]]. Following the [[Carreras Incident]], Draco objected to the Empress' new policy of ignoring Darth Wredd and letting him kill the One Sith but followed his orders nonetheless. Draco later implemented the Empress' \"Most Wanted\" campaign to hunt down war criminals from the Second Imperial Civil War. During this campaign, the junk dealer [[Ania Solo]] was arrested for allegedly murdering the Imperial Knight [[Teemen Alton]]. Draco personally headed the three&ndash;member military tribunal prosecuting her but was forced to acquit her after the Imperial Knights [[Yalta Val]] and [[Jao Assam]] presented evidence clearing her name. Later, Draco had Jao arrested on charges of deserting the Imperial Knights. After Darth Wredd kidnapped Jao Assam, Antares Draco commanded an Imperial Knight force against One Sith forces during the [[Battle of the Floating World]]. During the battle, Draco was wounded but recovered due to timely medical intervention by Ania and her [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] friend [[Sauk]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Sith&ndash;Imperial War===\n{{Quote|Mohrgan&hellip;the others&mdash;!''\"<br />\"''I felt it too.

Fel planned to arrest [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Morlish Veed]], whom he suspected had disobeyed him by ordering the [[Massacre at Ossus|Massacre]] of the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]] at Ossus. Fel instructed Draco and Mohrgan to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Veed if he made any suspicious moves and to keep a close [[Eye/Legends|eye]] on [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Morrigan Corde|Nyna Calixte]]. At that moment, Calixte revealed herself to be in the room with them and eavesdropping on their conversation. After being held against the wall by Mohrgan's [[Telekinesis/Legends|use of]] [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], she informed them that Fel's [[One Sith|Sith allies]] were planning to kill him. Draco advised his Emperor not to trust her, but Fel bid her explain herself, prompting her to point out that his survival was in her interests in addition to his own.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 8: Allies\" />\n\nMohrgan volunteered to lead a contingent of Imperial Knights and accompany [[Roan Fel's double|Fel's double]] in appearing before the [[Moff/Legends|Moffs]], a ruse which ultimately allowed Fel and Draco to flee the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. [[Darth Krayt]], the leader of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], appeared at the Moff's meeting and slew Mohrgan's entire contingent before [[Attack on Emperor Fel|striking down]] Fel's decoy and declaring himself the new Emperor of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 8: Allies\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 1: Broken, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 1|''Legacy'' (2006) 1]]</ref> Concurrent with these events, Fel and Draco made an underground escape from Coruscant through [[Sublevel 12]]'s maintenance tunnels to a waiting [[Starship/Legends|ship]] that had been arranged by Calixte. As the two destroyed [[LV8-series guard droid|guard droids]] that attempted to halt them, Draco [[Wound in the Force|felt the deaths]] of his fellow Knights in the Force. Fel told him that they would honor their sacrifices by escaping. Displaced from his throne, Roan Fel and his Imperial Knights were now in exile.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 8: Allies\" />\n\n===Second Imperial Civil War===\n====Rescue at Vendaxa====\n{{Quote|Is loyalty always the same as obedience?|Draco to Ganner Krieg|Legacy (2006) 6}}\nAt some point before [[137 ABY]], Draco earned the title of [[Imperial Knight|Master]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 7: Broken, Part 6\">[[Legacy (2006) 7|''Legacy'' (2006) 7]]</ref> and, under the tutelage of Master [[Darth Havok|Eshkar Niin]],<ref name=\"extremes2\" /> became the second-in-command of the Imperial Knights.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd\">''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd]]''</ref> Behind Fel himself, Draco was the highest-ranking member of the organization<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> and was at the head of its disciplined command structure.<ref name=\"Ultimate Visual Guide Special Edition\">[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide|''Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Special Edition'']]</ref> When Niin abandoned his vows to the Emperor and deserted the Order, Draco was sent to kill him and located him on the rooftop of a [[City/Legends|city]] filled with [[Skyscraper/Legends|skyscrapers]]. Niin had himself hunted Fel's wife, Empress [[Elliah Fel]], to the rooftop, and both Draco and Elliah [[Rooftop duel|engaged]] him in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]]. Niin ignored their pleas to remember his vows and Force-shoved Draco away before striking the Empress down. Draco attacked and mortally wounded him in retaliation, and afterward believed his former Master to be dead. Niin in fact survived the encounter and joined Darth Krayt's Sith as a [[Sith Inquisitor]].<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 2]]''</ref>\n\nAfter seven years of conducting hit-and-run tactics on [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Krayt's Imperial]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleets]], Roan Fel [[Fall of Bastion|returned]] to the Imperial stronghold of [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]], which Krayt had claimed shortly after the conclusion of the war. Draco accompanied Fel as he arrived on-planet, along with two other Imperial Knights, [[Sigel Dare]] and Draco's trusted friend, [[Ganner Krieg]]. After securing the loyalty of the Imperial forces stationed on the planet, Fel believed that his [[Empire-in-exile|Empire]] could now become a more potent threat to Krayt, although Draco cautioned him that Krayt would now know where to find him. Fel was then informed by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Oron Jaeger]] that [[Elke Vetter]], an Imperial Knight and the bodyguard of Fel's daughter, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Marasiah Fel]], had been killed on [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]], and that Marasiah was missing. Draco immediately volunteered to take three Knights to Socorro to rescue her but was forbidden from doing so by Fel, who would not allow his new base to be discovered just yet. A distraught Draco told Fel that he did not understand, but would obey.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 3: Broken, Part 3\">[[Legacy (2006) 3|''Legacy'' (2006) 3]]</ref> Nevertheless, Draco continued his attempts to convince the Emperor to mount a rescue mission, proclaiming that he would die before revealing that Bastion had been retaken. Reminded by Krieg that they had sworn an oath of loyalty to the Emperor, Draco wondered if loyalty was the same as obedience.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\">[[Legacy (2006) 6|''Legacy'' (2006) 6]]</ref>\n\n[[File:ImperialKnightsonVendaxa.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Draco protects Marasiah Fel from forces of the One Sith on Vendaxa.]]\nDespite their orders, Draco and Krieg made their way in two stolen [[Predator-class fighter|''Predator''-class fighters]] to [[Vendaxa/Legends|Vendaxa]], where Marasiah and her companion, [[Astraal Vao]], had been picked up by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Cade Skywalker]] and had rendezvoused with two [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], [[Wolf Sazen]] and Astraal's brother, [[Shado Vao]]. Arriving at the site of Skywalker's grounded ship, the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']], the pair's [[Starfighter/Legends|fighters]] were shot down by a Sith [[Fury-class starfighter|''Fury''-class starfighter]]. Draco and Krieg managed to escape the flaming wrecks of their ships and arrived on the scene simultaneously with the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] [[Darth Talon]], [[Darth Nihl]], and a [[Legion/Legends|legion]] of other Sith that had been pursuing Marasiah since her escape from Socorro. With his hood up, Draco appeared to the Sith to be Fel himself but revealed his identity and told them to run while they still had the chance. Along with the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the Princess, Draco and Krieg ignited their [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] and engaged the Sith in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|combat]]. Despite seven years of tension between the Jedi and Roan Fel's Empire, the Jedi and Imperial Knights were [[Skirmish on Vendaxa|fighting side-by-side]] against their common enemy, the Sith. Marasiah was angered by Draco's attempt to rescue her, which she suspected had been forbidden by her father. Draco's reasoning was that he loved her, a fact that she informed him she was already aware of. She was soon after cut down by a [[Unidentified Zabrak Sith (Male)|Zabrak Sith]] while protecting a derelict Skywalker.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\" />\n\nBelieving that a person whom they had sworn to protect had been killed, Draco and Krieg fought the Sith with renewed vigor. Draco cradled what he believed to be Marasiah's corpse in his arms until faint signs of life led him to rush her to the ''Mynock'' while Sazen covered him. When Sazen attempted to return to the battle, Draco held him back, insisting that Marasiah's life was more important than anyone else's. Sazen was distrustful of Fel's Imperials due to the Massacre at Ossus, but Draco revealed that the said Massacre had happened against the Emperor's orders and managed to convince Sazen to do whatever he could to [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] the Princess. Draco rushed back outside of the ship, only to find that it was taking off, with everyone but the Sith aboard. As Talon leaped onto the ship's closing [[Entry ramp/Legends|hatch]], Draco Force-pushed her off, allowing the ''Mynock'' to leave the surviving Sith behind and escape.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 7: Broken, Part 6\" />\n\nOn the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]], Draco pressured [[Jariah Syn]] and [[Deliah Blue]], respectively the ship's co-[[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]], to set a course for Bastion and bid them get there as fast as they could, else he would kill them. When Krieg told Draco that Marasiah was on her way to death, a very reluctant Skywalker&mdash;reminded of his [[Dark transfer|healing powers]]&mdash;offered to help but was met with a punch to the face by an emotionally heated Draco. Vao intervened and prevented a fight from ensuing, and his sister convinced Draco and Krieg to let Skywalker heal Marasiah. After Skywalker used his powers to bring Marasiah back from the edge of death, the ''Mynock'' safely arrived at Bastion.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 7: Broken, Part 6\" />\n\n====Vendaxa fallout====\n{{Quote|We're going to win back the Emperor's trust.|Draco while aboard the Wheel|Legacy (2006) 9}}\n[[File:SwLegacy10.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Draco and Krieg safeguard Mingo Bovark while aboard the Wheel.]]\nShortly after Skywalker and the Jedi departed Bastion in the ''Mynock'', Fel requested an audience with Draco and Krieg and berated them for having disobeyed a direct order, accusing Draco of putting his love for the Princess before the needs of the Empire. As the Sith had likely tracked the ''Mynock'' to Bastion, Fel believed that he was now in a stalemate with Krayt's Empire. Draco, ready to receive any punishment that the Emperor wished to hand them, was shocked when Fel told them that they would be receiving medals. Fel was retroactively approving their mission to Vendaxa, rather than having news of their insubordination undermine his authority. Draco's and Krieg's punishment was thus that they were being declared the Empire's foremost heroes and thenceforth being tasked with its most dangerous missions. Fel then told Draco to forget the idea of [[Marriage/Legends|marrying]] Marasiah and sent the two on their next mission: escorting [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Mingo Bovark]] to [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 9|''Legacy'' (2006) 9]]</ref> a [[Space station/Legends|space station]] in the [[Besh Gorgon system/Legends|Besh Gorgon system]] that had remained neutral throughout Fel's conflicts with the Galactic Alliance and the Sith.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> Bovark would be discussing a possible alliance against Krayt with [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]] of the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]], and Draco and Krieg's mission was to ensure Bovark's safety at all costs and to see that the negotiations went smoothly. Before their departure, a ceremony was held in which the two Imperial Knights received their medals.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\" />\n\nAboard the Wheel, Stazi and Bovark met in a conference room, with each participant's set of guards required to wait outside. Draco and Krieg, despite having been required to leave their [[Imperial Knight lightsaber|lightsabers]] aboard their ship, smuggled them aboard the space station.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\" /> While the talks were happening, Morrigan Corde and [[Jor Torlin]], [[Spy/Legends|spies]] from Krayt's Empire, managed to cause the Imperial [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] to [[Skirmish on The Wheel|fire]] on Stazi's ship using a [[Command Override Limpet Droid]], prompting Stazi to believe that Roan Fel had betrayed him. A firefight erupted between the Imperial Knights and the [[Galactic Alliance Intelligence officer]]s, and Krieg held off the guards while Draco burst into the room to retrieve Bovark, Force-pushing an angry Stazi against a bulkhead. Wheel [[Administrator/Legends|Administrator]] [[Pol Temm]] and several [[Wheel Security Force|security guards]] arrived and called on the Imperial Knights to surrender their weapons immediately. Draco refused, and Temm ordered the Imperials off of the Wheel, declaring the station off-limits to all of Roan Fel's forces. Suspecting sabotage, Draco vowed to find and kill whomever was responsible.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 10: Trust Issues, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 10|''Legacy'' (2006) 10]]</ref>\n\nSome [[Time/Legends|time]] later, while on Bastion, Draco felt a [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|disturbance in the Force]] and rushed to the [[Pellaeon Gardens]], where he found Emperor Fel standing over the corpse of the Sith Lord [[Darth Kruhl]]. Kruhl had arrived on-planet aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Dauntless (Pellaeon-class)|''Dauntless'']], whose crew had been sent by [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt under the guise of defecting to Fel's Empire; the ruse allowed Kruhl to [[Duel on Bastion|mount an attempt]] on Fel's life. Fel shook off Draco's concerns over his well-being and informed him that he would be sending Krayt a message back. Every crew member of the ''Dauntless'' was then killed, save for its [[Governor/Legends|Governor]], [[Vikar Dorn]], who was spared in order to deliver the message.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 13: Ready to Die\">[[Legacy (2006) 13|''Legacy'' (2006) 13]]</ref>\n\nOver the next several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 17: Claws of the Dragon, Part 4\">[[Legacy (2006) 17|''Legacy'' (2006) 17]]</ref> acting on the orders of the Emperor, Draco kept mainly to himself and avoided Marasiah Fel in particular as she completed her training and became a full-fledged Imperial Knight. As the Emperor prepared to send Marasiah, Draco, and Krieg on a mission, Draco sat sulking in the gardens of Bastion's royal greenhouses and was approached by Marasiah. Worried about her safety, he intended to counsel the Emperor to replace her on the mission with another Imperial Knight. Marasiah surprised him with a kiss and told him that she had no intention of letting her father run her personal life.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 23: Loyalties, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]</ref>\n\n====Pursuing Cade Skywalker====\n{{Quote|Defend her Imperial Majesty!''\"<br />\"''She wasn't invited, and you Imperial Knights ain't wanted.

Undercover and posing as a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunter, Rae confronted Skywalker as he visited his uncle, [[Rawk|\"Bantha\" Rawk]], on [[Iego/Legends|Iego]]. Because of her status as a former Jedi and a childhood friend of Skywalker's, Rae was able to learn of the existence of the Jedi's [[Hidden Temple (Sith\u2013Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]]. As she prepared to follow the ''Mynock'' to the temple in her [[Azlyn Rae's GPE-7300 transport|ship]], Rae relayed the Temple's coordinates to Draco, Krieg, and Marasiah, who were waiting nearby in a [[Sigma-class long-range shuttle|ship of their own]]. Although both Draco and Krieg suspected that Rae might be setting them up, the three Imperial Knights set a course for the Hidden Temple on [[Taivas]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 24: Loyalties, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 24|''Legacy'' (2006) 24]]</ref> Their hope was to negotiate an alliance between Fel's Empire and the Jedi Order.

Draco, Krieg, and Marasiah disembarked just as the ''Mynock''{{'s}} crew was being greeted by Wolf Sazen and Shado Vao; Draco and Krieg walked out with their lightsabers drawn in an effort to protect the Princess from any potential danger. Misinterpreted as hostility, the move prompted Vao and Skywalker to draw their own weapons and [[Skirmish at the Hidden Jedi Temple|engage]] the two Imperial Knights in duels. Draco dueled Skywalker in defense of what he perceived to be an attack on Marasiah. Furious that they had hitched a free ride on his ship and realizing Rae's true identity as an Imperial Knight, Skywalker Force-pushed both Draco and Krieg across the hangar. In response, Marasiah ignited her own lightsaber and informed Skywalker that the Imperial Knights had come on a mission of peace.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 25: The Hidden Temple, Part 1\" />\n\nAfter tensions between the gathered parties had died down, the Imperial delegation was permitted to see the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi Council]]. In the [[Council Chamber (Hidden Temple)|Council Chamber]], Skywalker, Rawk, Sazen, Vao, Draco, Krieg, and Marasiah appeared before [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[K'Kruhk]], [[T'ra Saa]], and [[Tili Qua]]. Saa believed that the Force had allowed the Imperial Knights to come to the Hidden Temple for a reason. Draco stood by as Marasiah gave a long speech that revealed that her father had not ordered the Massacre at Ossus and called on the Jedi to open talks with him so that they might join forces against their common enemy, the Sith. Skywalker chimed in, revealing knowledge of Darth Krayt and the One Sith that he had learned during his time as their captive, and proposed a plan of his own: [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] Darth Krayt. Although the Jedi Council was taken aback by Skywalker's proposal, the Imperial Knights were impressed by it&mdash;Draco deemed it to be the first thing Skywalker had ever said that he liked.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 25: The Hidden Temple, Part 1\" /> Ultimately, the Council did not support the mission, but Skywalker decided to proceed without their assistance. Marasiah assigned Draco, Krieg, and Rae to accompany him on his mission, while she would stay behind to continue negotiating an alliance with the Jedi.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 26: The Hidden Temple, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 26|''Legacy'' (2006) 26]]</ref> Draco was appointed the leader of the Imperial Knights' mission.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 30: Vector, Part 11\">[[Legacy (2006) 30|''Legacy'' (2006) 30]]</ref> Skywalker's [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]], [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], opened the cargo bay doors of the ''Mynock'' and allowed Draco and Krieg to load their TIE Predators into the ship's hold. With their fighters already aboard his ship, Skywalker reluctantly allowed the Imperial Knights to join him on the mission. Vao joined the strike team as well as the sole representative of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 26: The Hidden Temple, Part 2\" />\n\n====Skywalker's strike team====\n{{Quote|Your will be done, Majesty.|Draco, receiving new orders from Roan Fel|Legacy (2006) 29: Vector, Part 10}}\n[[File:Impknightsinpredators.png|thumb|left|300px|Krieg and Draco piloting TIE Predators at Had Abbadon]]\nSkywalker formulated a [[Mission to Had Abbadon|plan]] to lure Krayt to the planet [[Had Abbadon/Legends|Had Abbadon]]. ''En route'', Draco and Krieg watched Vao practice his lightsaber technique against a [[Remote/Legends|remote]] in the ''Mynock''{{'s}} cargo hold. Soon, the ship was drawn out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] by the [[Interdiction field/Legends|interdiction field]] of the Star Destroyer ''[[Iron Sun]]'', which [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] Jedi [[Celeste Morne]] had commandeered ten years before and kept dormant in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]]. Draco observed that there were no TIE Predators meeting them and that the Star Destroyer's [[Hull/Legends|hull]] had taken fire damage from the inside. After the ''Mynock'' was locked in a [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]], Vao and Skywalker sensed the presence of a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-user]] on the ship, and the crew set out to explore the derelict vessel. Skywalker ordered Draco and Krieg to investigate the corridors connected to the hangar bay, where they found several [[Bone/Legends|bones]], some of which had been gnawed on. Following an attack on Skywalker, Rae, Vao, and Jariah Syn by beasts known as [[Rakghoul]]s, Draco contacted Deliah Blue on the ''Mynock'' and suggested that Skywalker was dead and that the mission be called off. Blue ignored him and rushed into the interior of the ship, and Draco and Krieg followed her. The trio located Syn and Vao in front of a locked door, along with several tame-seeming Rakghouls, beasts that Morne was able to control with the power of the [[Muur Talisman]], an ancient [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] that housed the [[Force ghost|spirit]] of the Sith Lord [[Karness Muur]]. As Draco and Vao attempted to force their way through the door, it suddenly opened, revealing a weary Skywalker and Rae. Morne followed, and, having just been impressed by Skywalker's healing abilities, decided to join them on their mission.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 28: Vector, Part 9\">[[Legacy (2006) 28|''Legacy'' (2006) 28]]</ref>\n\nWith Morne as its newest passenger, the ''Mynock'' arrived at Had Abbadon, a planet that was under the control of Krayt's Empire. Posing as pilots from the planet's Imperial base, Draco and Krieg flew their TIE Predators after Shado Vao's [[X-83 TwinTail starfighter|TwinTail Fighter]] and blasted grounded TIE pilots before they could get to their ships, helping to rid the base of Krayt's Imperials. With the base clear, Draco accessed the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] and informed Roan Fel of the Muur Talisman's existence. Realizing its power, Fel told Draco to obtain it. With his new instructions, Draco interrupted a tender moment between Krieg and Rae and got into a verbal quarrel with the two of them, both of whom questioned Fel's new order. After Rae stormed off, Draco told Krieg that he would have to kill her if she disobeyed their Emperor and was met with a heated rebuke from his trusted friend: he would have to kill Krieg first. Tensions mounted between the two as they argued over their primary duties as Imperial Knights, and, with the argument unresolved, Krieg walked away.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10\">[[Legacy (2006) 29|''Legacy'' (2006) 29]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Muurpwnsdraco.png|thumb|right|160px|Celeste Morne Force-pushes Draco while the spirit of Karness Muur looks on approvingly.]]\nLured to Had Abbadon by the bait of the Muur Talisman, Darth Krayt arrived along with four of his most trusted Sith Lords: [[Darth Stryfe|Darths Stryfe]], [[Darth Wyyrlok (III)|Wyyrlok]], Talon, and [[Darth Maladi|Maladi]]. All of the Sith Lords save Wyyrlok confronted Morne and Skywalker, before Draco, Krieg, Rae, and Vao emerged from hiding, having managed to [[Force stealth|conceal themselves in the Force]]. The six members of the strike team [[Battle on Had Abbadon|attacked the Sith]] and were aided by Morne's [[Army/Legends|army]] of Rakghouls, which ended up cutting the Imperial Knights off from the battle. Hoping to ensure the death of Krayt and also desiring the Talisman, Draco ordered Krieg and Rae to find Krayt while he confronted Morne. Rae protested but was angrily Force-pushed away by Draco, who was in turn physically restrained by Krieg. A frustrated Krieg bid Draco to go confront Morne while he and Rae dealt with Krayt. With his lightsaber, Draco cut his way through several Rakghouls and confronted Morne, who engaged him in lightsaber combat, taunting him and telling him that the Emperor was not worthy of the Talisman. She then Force-pushed Draco away, causing him to hit his head and lose consciousness.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 30: Vector, Part 11\" />\n\nWhile Draco lay [[Sleep/Legends|unconscious]], Krayt was [[Shiak|stabbed]] through the chest by Rae and Force-pushed off of a cliff by Morne before being betrayed and nearly killed by his own servant, Darth Wyyrlok. However, the [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] produced during the confrontation grievously wounded Rae. After Krayt's defeat, Skywalker [[Shatterpoint/Legends|destroyed]] the Talisman and killed Morne but was unable to effectively heal Rae with the Force. As Draco regained consciousness, the crew of the ''Mynock'' prepared to depart for [[Kiffex/Legends|Kiffex]] with Vao and Rae. Skywalker refused Draco and Krieg passage, as he knew that they had tried to secure the Talisman for their Emperor. The ''Mynock'' departed, leaving Draco insistent that he and Krieg return to Bastion to report to Fel.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 31: Vector, Part 12\">[[Legacy (2006) 31|''Legacy'' (2006) 31]]</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Bastion, the two were joined by Sigel Dare in appearing before the Emperor. Fel was not pleased that they had allowed the Talisman to be destroyed, and, without proof, was not entirely convinced that Krayt had been killed. His sources told him that Krayt was in [[Suspended animation/Legends|stasis]] on [[Korriban]], and, as such, he assigned Draco to discover what was happening on Coruscant as rumors spread regarding the Sith Lord's demise.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 35: Storms, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 35|''Legacy'' (2006) 35]]</ref>\n\n====The captured princess====\n{{Quote|And if there ''is'' an attack, do you know what to do?''\"<br />\"''My duty will be to get the Emperor and the Princess clear.''\"<br />\"''And if you can only get ''one'' clear?

The Imperial Knights made camp for the night on Agamar's [[Grass/Legends|grassy]] plains, which led Draco to feel that his Emperor and Princess were in the open and vulnerable. He held a discussion regarding their situation with Master Sinde that soon shifted in tone to a quandary regarding Draco's responsibility to Fel. Draco assured a skeptical Sinde that his duty to the Emperor outweighed his duty to the Princess.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\">[[Legacy (2006) 45|''Legacy'' (2006) 45]]</ref>\n\nThe following morning, the Imperial delegation met with representatives from the Jedi, led by Master K'Kruhk. Everyone present disguised themselves as [[Agamarian]] [[Farm/Legends|farmers]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" /> and several of the Imperial Knights positioned themselves away from the meeting, pretending to work on a nearby field.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" /><ref name=\"Legacy 46\">[[Legacy (2006) 46|''Legacy'' (2006) 46]]</ref> After a formal alliance was struck and Fel declared Bastion a safe haven for both the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance, Draco sensed an approaching intruder riding a [[Agamarian beast|local animal]]. Sinde ordered Masters Krieg and Dare to open fire. The two hit the beast with shots from their [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]] until Fel recognized the rider as Nyna Calixte, who had been serving Krayt's Empire since the end of the Sith&ndash;Imperial War. Calixte hurriedly told the assembled party that the Sith were aware of the meeting and had [[Operation: Thunderstroke|sent]] a [[First Sith Imperial Strikeforce|task force]] under the command of Moff [[Rulf Yage]] to capture or kill the Emperor. As the task force, led by the [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[War Hammer]]'', engaged Fel's ''Dauntless'' in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]], she suggested that the Imperial Knights and Jedi run if they wanted to survive.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" />\n\n[[File:IKAgamar2-L46.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Draco, Krieg and the Emperor battle Sith on Agamar.]]\nThe Imperial Knights and Jedi were quickly advanced upon by a group of Sith emerging from nearby swamps. Draco and K'Kruhk called on their respective parties to defend Emperor Fel, and all disguises were shed as a battle ensued. At least ten Sith fell to the blades of the Imperial Knights and Jedi, as well as to the [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] of Calixte. Fighting next to Fel, Draco hailed the Imperial Knights' escape shuttle ''[[Defender One]]'', which landed near the site of the melee in order to evacuate the Emperor. As Sinde and K'Kruhk began clearing a path toward the shuttle, the surviving Imperial Knights and Jedi boarded, save for Marasiah, Rae, and the Jedi [[Rasi Tuum]], who were too far away. As enemy starfighters began approaching, Sinde reminded Draco of his duty to the Emperor. Draco longingly stared at Marasiah as he gave the order for the shuttle to lift off. ''Defender One'' escaped the planet as the ''Dauntless'' held a corridor of space open for them, taking the brunt of the ''War Hammer''{{'s}} attack and being destroyed in the process. Fel told Draco that he felt Marasiah in the Force, and although she was not dead, she was in the hands of the Sith. Draco swore to his Emperor that he would rescue the Princess.<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" />\n\n''Defender One'' brought the Imperial Knights and Jedi to Bastion. On Agamar, Marasiah was kidnapped by the Sith and taken to Korriban, but Rae and Tuum stole a [[Sith&ndash;Imperial attack ship]] and returned to Bastion. As the vessel approached the Imperial [[fortress world]], Draco, Krieg, Sinde, Shado Vao, and the Imperial Knights' [[Master armorer]] [[Hogrum Chalk]] were roused from their sleep by alarms and rushed to a landing platform. Chalk unsuccessfully attempted to contact the ship, but when Rae contacted Krieg via [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], Chalk ordered Bastion's defensive [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] batteries to cease firing on the ship. When Rae and Tuum landed, a furious Draco began berating them for not having brought Marasiah with them. When Tuum intervened, Draco Force-pushed the Jedi Master away, but the confrontation was ended when Fel summoned them all to [[Roan Fel's quarters|his quarters]]. Fel worried that Marasiah knew all of the Empire's codes, and gave Draco three hours to form a rescue plan. Unsure of what to do, Draco consulted [[Eshkar Niin's holocron|the holocron]] of his former Master, Eshkar Niin. Krieg followed him to [[Antares Draco's quarters|his quarters]] and advised him to master his anger, but Draco instead called on old advice of Niin's and chose to focus his anger in order to rescue the princess.<ref name=\"extremes2\" />\n\n====A broken man====\n{{Quote|Forgiveness is impossible, I know, my lady.

The three [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|went]] to Korriban, where Draco bullied a [[Unidentified Neimoidian Sith|Neimoidian Sith]] into allowing them access to the Sith [[Chambers of Persuasion]].<ref name=\"extremes2\" /> Therein, they came across the princess, and seized the lightsabers of several Sith guards via telekinesis. The trio quickly disposed of them, and Draco cradled an injured Marasiah in his arms. She lashed out at him, however, believing that he had known of Niin's survival. Niin, now Darth Havok, had been [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] Marasiah, and Draco was shocked to hear that his former Master lived. Vao forestalled any further discussion by insisting that they return to their ship, a short trip that saw all four of them participate in the massacre of more Sith. When they cut their way through enough enemies to clear a path to the ship, Draco informed his allies that he would remain behind and allow them to take off. Marasiah protested, telling him that she had realized his ignorance of Niin's survival, but Draco had made peace with the idea of dying to protect her. Krieg had to restrain her on their way to the ship as a new group of Sith rushed at Draco.<ref name=\"extremes3\">[[Legacy (2006) 50|''Legacy'' (2006) 50]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Dracoslaststand.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Draco makes a last stand against Darth Havok.]]\nDraco slaughtered all of his attackers, only to be advanced upon by Havok himself. As they traded banter, Havok remarked that Draco's anger would suit him well as a Sith. Draco was simply eager for the chance to finally kill his former Master, and the two locked lightsabers. Both of them used the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] to fuel their attack, and as such, both felt the will of Darth Krayt. The Dark Lord had been presumed dead, but was alive and well and was projecting his will across the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. Havok gave his former student a final chance to join the Sith, but Draco refused, insisting that he would rather die. Havok then shocked him with Force lightning, knocking him out of the fight and severing his presence from the Force.<ref name=\"extremes3\" /> Draco became Havok's [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] and was subject to the torture inflicted by his former Master. Havok hoped to extract information from his captive, and used the Force to cut Draco's body with shards of [[Transparisteel/Legends|transparisteel]] in between healing periods in a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]]. Draco refused to talk, however, firm in his conviction that he would rather die.<ref name=\"Legacy War 1\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 1]]''</ref>\n\nHavok was well aware of Draco's vulnerabilities<ref name=\"Legacy War 1\" /> and created a [[Mind trick/Legends|Force illusion]] that transported his prisoner back to the day that Elliah Fel had died. As Draco relived her death, Havok appealed to his guilt at failing to save her before presenting Darth Talon, made to look like a captive Marasiah due to another Force illusion. Havok claimed that the Princess had been retaken while escaping Korriban and threatened to kill her if Draco did not tell him any valuable information, prompting the Imperial Knight to reveal the existence and location of the Jedi's Hidden Temple. Talon left to relay the information to Darth Krayt, and Havok nevertheless continued to shock his prisoner with Force lightning. Krayt was eager to face Cade Skywalker in combat again and bade Talon to present a broken Draco to him as a gift.<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" /> Talon had Draco [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|frozen]] in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and brought him to the Wheel, where Skywalker was meeting with Calixte, now an enemy of Krayt after being outed as Fel's spy. Talon infiltrated the ''Mynock'' and placed Draco in its cargo hold before briefly [[Second Skirmish on The Wheel|dueling]] Skywalker and fleeing the space station.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 3]]''</ref>\n\nWhen Skywalker entered his ship, he ordered R2-D2 to defrost Draco. Draco awoke from hibernation and told the ''Mynock''{{'s}} crew about his mission to Korriban and subsequent imprisonment, and revealed that he had given away the location of the Hidden Temple. Skywalker was enraged and threatened to kill him, but he instead contacted Taivas and warned them before taking the ''Mynock'' there himself. Marasiah was at the Temple with an Imperial Knight bodyguard contingent, and Krieg and Rae greeted Draco after the ''Mynock'' made planetfall before bringing him before the Princess. She castigated him for choosing to talk rather than dying, but, due to the courage he had displayed in rescuing her, she gave him a chance to reclaim his honor by aiding in the defense of the Temple from the inevitable Sith attack.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\" />\n\n====Redemption====\n{{Quote|Forgive me, my Emperor&hellip; but I am not worthy of your trust!

The Emperor and Gar Stazi joined them via [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] and pledged their support to the Temple's defense. Skywalker devised a plan that would lure Krayt's forces into the Temple, thereby allowing the fleets of Fel and Stazi to emerge from hyperspace behind them and seal their [[Imperial Navy/Legends|naval]] forces in a trap. When the [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|attack]] came, the four present Imperial Knights stood with Skywalker and the Jedi in defending the Temple's outer portal from a group of advancing Sith. Draco vowed to fight beside the princess to honor or to death as they cut down the invaders. When Rawk contacted the Galactic Alliance and Empire-in-exile fleets, their [[Warship/Legends|warships]] arrived in the [[Star system/Legends|system]] and sprung the trap.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\" /> Krayt's secret army of [[Darth Krayt's Sith trooper|Sith troopers]] was not far behind, and several of the [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] landed on the ground and surrounded the defenders, who had been pushed back to the Temple's council chambers. The Skywalkers and [[Drok|three]] [[Sayar Dun'La|additional]] [[Te Corso|Jedi Masters]] remained in the chambers to defend Master T'ra Saa, who coordinated the allied forces with [[Battle meditation]], while Draco and the others retreated. The starships that composed the Hidden Temple then rose from the ground and fled the system, protected by a blast of [[Beam of light|Force energy]] that rose with them and by several ships that defected from Krayt's Empire during the battle. After having taken heavy losses from the Sith troopers, the surviving allies retreated to Bastion.<ref name=\"Legacy War 4\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 4]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Heycomeonyouregreat.jpg|thumb|left|310px|Draco expresses his doubts to the Emperor prior to the Battle of Coruscant.]]\nOn Bastion, Draco was debriefed by Masters Chalk and Sinde about his time on Korriban. The Emperor forgave him betraying the Hidden Temple's location, but Draco believed that he had betrayed his honor. Three days after the Hidden Temple's fall, the Emperor, Admiral Stazi, and the Jedi Council agreed to strike at Krayt on Coruscant before the Sith trooper army could attack Bastion. Fleet-wide preparations were made, and Draco retired to his [[Antares Draco's quarters (Jagged Fel)|quarters]] on Fel's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the ''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer [[Jagged Fel (starship)|''Jagged Fel'']]. As he re-donned the Imperial Knight armor he had left behind prior to infiltrating Korriban, Krieg caught up with him, and Draco shared with his friend his doubts about his honor. He also worried that the Sith had programmed him as a [[sleeper agent]], but Krieg urged his friend to find strength in the Force and forge himself anew rather than letting fear and the dark side take hold of him. Krieg, Rae, and Dare then joined a [[Cade Skywalker's strike team|strike team]] led by Morrigan Corde&mdash;a recent defector from Krayt's Empire who had directed [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] as her alter ego Nyna Calixte&mdash;and brought down Coruscant's orbital defenses prior to the fleets' arrival in-[[Coruscant system/Legends|system]]. Draco, however, remained at his Emperor's side aboard the ''Jagged Fel''. Fel requested the presence of those most loyal to him during the [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|battle]], and Draco stood with Marasiah, Master Sinde, and Hogrum Chalk. Draco yet believed that he was unworthy of the Emperor's trust, but Fel assured him that he could be counted on to always serve the Emperor's will.<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 5]]''</ref>\n\nThe ''Jagged Fel'' and the rest of the fleets arrived over Coruscant just as the orbital defenses were brought down. During a fierce [[Space warfare|space battle]], Fel ordered Draco to accompany him below-decks, where a half-crazed Darth Maladi was imprisoned<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\" />&mdash;Maladi had been discovered and taken prisoner by Master Chalk's agents in Imperial Intelligence and had offered to create a [[Omega Red|deadly pathogen]] for Fel in exchange for the head of Skywalker, who had mentally attacked her with the Force and left her in her current state.<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" /> Fel had ordered her to create it after learning of the Sith trooper army,<ref name=\"Legacy War 4\" /> and she now had the pathogen, Omega Red, finished. Draco watched as Maladi gave a shell containing Omega Red to Fel and informed him that it would wipe out all life on a planet within several [[Standard second|seconds]].<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\" /> Unbeknownst to either of them, Maladi was still serving Krayt and had designed the pathogen to have no effect on any Sith. Fel, prepared to go to any length to defeat Krayt, brought Draco to an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] and prepared to drop the pathogen onto Coruscant's surface, ignoring Draco's protests that it would also kill their allies and billions of innocents. When Sinde and Marasiah arrived and added their voices to Draco's, a determined Fel Force-pushed them against a wall and incapacitated them.<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\" /><ref name=\"Legacy War 6\" />\n\n[[File:Anoathfulfilled.jpg|thumb|right|310px|Draco crosses blades with the Emperor.]]\nDraco recalled the oath he had sworn upon becoming an Imperial Knight: to serve the Force as embodied by the Emperor, and to kill the Emperor if he were ever to fall to the dark side and could not return. He thus refused Fel's order and ignited his lightsaber; the two crossed blades as Fel rued the trust he had placed in Draco to unquestioningly obey his will. While they dueled, Skywalker slew Krayt on the planet's surface, and Draco felt the Dark Lord's death in the Force. Fel claimed it was a trick and punched Draco in the face, but Draco recovered and stabbed his Emperor through the back before Fel could push the button that would launch the escape pod. As the Emperor lay dead, Draco kneeled over his corpse, paralyzed with disbelief of what had just occurred.<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\" />\n\nElsewhere in the battle, Krayt's Sith troopers went insane after their Lord, to whom their wills were linked via the dark side, was slain, and the rest of Krayt's fleet fled into hyperspace, ceding the capital to the allies. The surviving Sith went into hiding, and the war was brought to an end. In the battle's aftermath, a [[Funeral of Roan Fel|funeral]] was held for the Emperor, and Draco and Krieg stood next to Master Chalk as the master armorer delivered a eulogy, ignited lightsabers in their hands. Chalk also announced that Marasiah had been crowned Empress and would join Admiral Stazi and Jedi Master K'Kruhk in forming the [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]], which would unify the galaxy in the wake of the Sith's rule.<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\" />\n\n===Triumvirate===\n====The Carreras Incident====\n[[File:Jao_Draco_and_Sia.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Draco and Sia corresponding with the Imperial Knight Jao Assam]]\nIn [[138 ABY]], as the Triumvirate set about rebuilding the galaxy, Antares Draco continued to serve as an Imperial Knight, serving Empress Fel as her bodyguard on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-1\">[[Legacy (2013) 1|''Legacy'' (2013) 1]]</ref> The two continued their relationship, and Draco retained his position as head of the Imperial Knights, overseeing the training of recruits such as [[Jao Assam]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2-2\">[[Legacy (2013) 2|''Legacy'' (2013) 2]]</ref> That same year, Marasiah Fel embarked on an ambitious project to create a galactic [[G51 communications array]] to connect the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] systems to the galaxy. Several Imperial Knights including Jao and Master Yalta Val were sent to supervise the construction of local arrays throughout the galaxy. While traveling to the [[Carreras system]], Val was kidnapped and imprisoned by the rogue Sith [[Darth Wredd]], who impersonated the Imperial Knight in order to take control of the [[Carreras G51 communications array|Carreras array]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2-1\" />\n\nYalta Val's disappearance worried Jao Assam, who raised his concerns with Empress Marasiah Fel, explaining that Master Val would have used his [[Unidentified Imperial communications droid|Imperial comm droid]] to transmit is coordinates. Jao offered to travel to the Carreras system and ascertain Val's whereabouts. However, Empress Fel over-ruled him and ordered Jao to remain in the [[Ottega system/Legends|Ottega system]] to supervise the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] link. Antares Draco was present during Fel's conversation with Jao. Following the conversation, Fel confided in Draco, who described Jao as being rash but having good instincts. He expressed concerns about the lack of communications from Val. Empress Fel commented that navigating through the Carreras system was trick and that they had to give Val the time to do his job. Draco explained that the Imperial Knights faced a shortage of skilled warriors and reiterated that the Order could not afford to lose more Knights. Fel replied that the galaxy could never find out about this shortage and emphasized that the Imperial Knights represented the Galactic Triumvirate. Fel expressed her frustrations about trying to make Master K'Kruhk and Admiral Stazi understand that the Triumvirate was committed to keeping its promises to the galaxy. She commented that the Knights could never afford to look weak. Draco then assured her that she was strong and that they would prevail through this test.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-2\" />\n\nUnknown to both Antares Draco and Marasiah Fel, Assam disobeyed his orders and traveled to the Carreras system to investigate Val's whereabouts. There, he met a local [[Junk dealer/Legends|junk dealer]] [[Ania Solo]] and her companions and quickly learnt that Master Val had been replaced by a Sith impostor.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-3\">[[Legacy (2013) 3|''Legacy'' (2013) 3]]</ref> Ultimately, Wredd succeeded in taking control of the Carreras communications array and used it to broadcast his manifesto to the galaxy, in which he derided the Galactic Triumvirate. Draco and Fel witnessed the broadcast and were horrified to see a captive Master Val, bound to a chair. Wredd then attempted to execute Val before a galactic audience but was stopped by Ania, who succeeded in rescuing Fel and evacuating him offworld before the Carreras array collided with the floating world of [[Mala (planet)|Mala]]. Following the \"[[Carreras Incident]]\", Draco received a report from Governor [[Biala]] that a young woman named Ania had been involved in the destruction of the Carreras array.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-5\">[[Legacy (2013) 5|''Legacy'' (2013) 5]]</ref>\n\n====A new threat====\n[[File:Galactic_Triumvirate_meeting.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Draco (center) attending a Triumvirate meeting with Master K'Kruhk, Empress Fel, and Admiral Stazi]]\nIn response, Empress Fel dispatch the ''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer ''[[Animus]]'' to pick up Ania, her companions, and the rescued Imperial Knights Yalta Val and Jao Assam, who had been wounded during a fight with Darth Wredd. Ania and her companions were welcomed as guests by the Imperial crew of the ''Animus''. Meanwhile, the rogue Sith Darth Wredd embarked on a campaign to kill the various One Sith infiltrators, who had infiltrated key government and corporate positions on various planets including [[Cadomai Prime/Legends|Cadomai Prime]] and [[Ceitia Five]]. After receiving reports of this rampage, Empress Fel convened a meeting of her Triumvirate, during which Draco was present. During the meeting, Draco argued that the Triumvirate could not afford to lose focus on Darth Wredd since he had publicly threatened the government, destroyed the Carreras array, and almost murdered Master Val. When Jedi Master K'Kruhk and Admiral Gar Stazi suggested ignoring Wredd and letting him do the job of killing Sith, Jao objected. However, he was over-ruled by Empress Fel who decided to follow Stazi's recommendation.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-6\">[[Legacy (2013) 6|''Legacy'' (2013) 6]]</ref>\n\nDespite Draco's personal unease, he nevertheless relayed the Empress's orders to Master Yalta Val, who was aboard the ''Animus''. When Val suggested using Wredd to track down the other Sith, Draco explained that this was not the Triumvirate's present policy. He also reassigned Master Val to Coruscant to take up position as head of the Imperial Knights training facility there. Draco tasked Master Val with finding new recruits to bolster the ranks of the Order. In addition, Draco reassigned Jao Assam to Coruscant as punishment for abandoning his post in the Ottega system. Meanwhile, Jao Assam received a [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]] of Darth Wredd attacking Empress Marasiah Fel and expressed his concerns to Master Val. However, Master Val reiterated that they had to follow the Empress' orders. Still uncomfortable, Jao managed to persuade his new friend Ania to join him on a quest to hunt down Darth Wredd.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-6\" />\n\nFollowing Jao and Ania's escape, Masters Draco and Val were both summoned before Empress Marasiah Fel, who was furious that the Imperials had not secured Ania. Empress Fel also charged Jao with desertion despite Val's attempts to intercede for the younger Knight. Within the Imperial Knights, desertion carried the death penalty.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-7\">[[Legacy (2013) 7|''Legacy'' (2013) 7]]</ref> During their travels, Jao and Ania discovered that another rogue Sith Lord named [[Darth Luft]] and his [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] associates had established a [[Slavery/Legends|slaving operation]] in the lawless [[Calamari system]], which had been devastated during the Sith [[Genocide on Dac]].

Ania Solo ended up on the Triumvirate's \"Most Wanted\" list since she had been framed for the murder of an Imperial Knight named [[Teemen Alton]]. Disbelieving Ania's guilt, Master Val confronted his superior Antares Draco at his private apartments in Coruscant and criticized the Triumvirate's new war criminal campaign, arguing that the authorities had their priorities misplaced. Draco was defensive and warned Val to be careful with his words. While acknowledging that Ania had saved Val's life in the Carreras system, he argued that things were not always as they seemed. Val then deduced that the Imperials had wanted to arrest Ania and make her disappear quietly during her time at the ''Animus''. Val then demanded to know what was going on.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-12\">[[Legacy (2013) 12|''Legacy'' (2013) 12]]</ref>\n\nDraco admitted that the Imperials had wanted to \"disappear\" Ania away by sending the ''Animus'' to pick her up. Due to Ania's recent notoriety following the Carreras Incident, he explained that the Triumvirate had to get the public on their side by placing her on their \"Most Wanted\" list. Draco then explained that the authorities had good evidence that she had killed an Imperial Knight, Teemen Alton. With the Triumvirate solidifying its control over the galaxy, Draco wanted to send a strong message that the Imperial Knights were the instruments of this new peace and that they would not tolerate any crimes against them, past or present.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-12\" /> Unconvinced of Ania's guilt, Master Val went through the Triumvirate archives and uncovered files which suggested that Alton's killer had a prosthetic hand, something which Ania did not. Val relayed this information to Jao and Ania's companions [[Sauk]] and [[AG-37]], who were on a quest to rescue Ania, who had been kidnapped by her old flame [[Ramid]] and was being stalked by a [[Unidentified bounty hunter|mysterious bounty hunter]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2-14\">[[Legacy (2013) 14|''Legacy'' (2013) 14]]</ref>\n\nImperial stormtroopers subsequently succeeded in apprehending Ania Solo on [[Unidentified planet (glass rain)|a remote planet which rained glass]]. Ania was extradited back to Coruscant to face a military tribunal, which consisted of three officials&mdash; Antares Draco, a [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] Galactic Alliance official, and a female Human Jedi. Knowing the facts about the Teemen Alton case, Master Yalta Val volunteered to represent Ania during the court proceedings. He defended Ania, pointing out that the evidence was circumstantial and stressing Ania's recent actions to save members of the Order. Representing the prosecution, Draco stressed Ania's guilt and demanded a swift resolution to the case. Val was able to weaken the prosecution's case by pointing out that Teemen's murderer had a prosthetic hand and that Ania had two biological hands. He added that Alton was strangled by a laser whip that could only be operated by a matching prosthetic hand.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-15\">[[Legacy (2013) 15|''Legacy'' (2013) 15]]</ref>\n\nVal's evidence managed to sway the Galactic Alliance and Jedi members of the tribunal but Antares Draco remained unswayed and demanded more evidence. However, Ania Solo was saved by the arrival of Jao Assam who presented the bounty hunter's severed prosthetic hand. He explained to the tribunal that the artificial hand belonged to Teemen's real murderer and that this person had tried to frame Ania for a crime that she did not commit. Faced with compelling evidence, the tribunal was forced to find Ania not guilty and to release her. However, Draco ordered Jao's arrest on charges of desertion and had him imprisoned. While in prison, Jao Assam was visited by the elusive Darth Wredd himself, who sensed the former's despondency at being untreated unfairly. Darth Wredd offered to help Jao escape from prison by handing him a [[Sith lightsaber/Legends|Sith lightsaber]] through the bars of his cell.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-15\" />\n\n====The Floating World====\n[[File:Antares_Draco_fighting_Sith_Floating_World.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Draco leading the Imperial Knights into combat]]\nFollowing Jao Assam's imprisonment, Ania attempted to seek an audience with Empress Marasiah Fel to advocate for clemency on Jao's behalf. However, the Empress's calendar was fully booked. Ania was also rebuffed by Antares Draco, who insisted that the Empress' decision to execute Jao was final and irreversible. Upon learning that Ania had tried to meet her, Empress Fel personally sought Ania out and arranged a special meeting with her. Believing that Jao had not turned to the dark side, Empress Fel ordered Ania and her companions to lead a platoon of [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] stormtroopers to find him. Ania agreed to assist Empress Fel in return for the Empress promising to find a way to circumvent the desertion charges. Ania's quest led them to the floating world of Mala.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-16\">[[Legacy (2013) 16|''Legacy'' (2013) 16]]</ref> However, Darth Wredd had tricked Jao into transmitting the planet's coordinates to the Triumvirate and the One Sith, in the hope of luring his two opponents in to a trap.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-17\">[[Legacy (2013) 17|''Legacy'' (2013) 17]]</ref>\n\nDuring the three-way [[Battle of the Floating World]], Masters Antares Draco and Yalta Val led the Imperial Knight ground charge against the One Sith army. At Draco's insistence, Empress Fel remained aboard her Star Destroyer. The Imperial Knight commanders were shocked to discover that instead of one rogue Sith, they were facing an entire Sith army. Empress Fel reluctantly stayed aboard since her loss would throw the galaxy and the Knights into crisis.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-17\" /> During the fighting, Draco was impaled through the abdomen by a [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] One Sith. His incapacitation prompted Empress Fel to enter the fray with several stormtroopers. Fortunately for Draco, he was rescued by Ania and her Mon Calamari friend Sauk who used a [[Medical droid/Legends|medical droid]] to seal his wounds. Following an intense and brutal battle, the Imperial Knights succeeded in killing the entire One Sith Army, with the aid of Ania's companions and the rogue Sith Darth Wredd.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-18\">[[Legacy (2013) 18|''Legacy'' (2013) 18]]</ref>\n\nFollowing the battle, Empress Fel ordered her Knights to evacuate their wounded comrades and to hunt down for the Sith survivors. While attending to the wounded Draco, Fel was stabbed from behind by Darth Wredd with his lightsaber, thus fulfilling Jao Assam's vision. Horrified, Jao pursued Darth Wredd and attacked him, slicing of his hands. However, Jao refused to kill Wredd, knowing that it would lead him to the dark side. In the end, Ania finished off the rogue Sith with a [[Heavy repeating blaster/Legends|heavy repeating blaster]]. Due to immediate medical treatment, Marasiah survived her injuries. Back on Coruscant, Draco's demeanor towards Ania improved out of gratitude for the young Solo saving his life on Mala. He led Ania into Empress Fel's medical ward. Grateful to Ania for saving the galaxy, she praised the Solo's courage and leadership skills and offered her a place in her personal guard. While Ania declined the offer, Fel agreed to dismiss the desertion charges against Jao Assam and allow him to join Ania and her companions in their travels throughout the galaxy. Empress Fel also began implementing reforms to the Imperial Knights Order to redirect their loyalty to the Force rather than the Empress alone.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-18\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|My passion is my strength&mdash;my passion is my weakness. So my Master always told me.|Draco to Ganner Krieg|Legacy (2006) 49: Extremes, Part 2}}\n[[File:AntaresDraco-LECG.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Antares Draco, Imperial Knight]]\nDraco's position as head of the Imperial Knights was one that he earned through years of hard work, discipline, and loyalty.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> He possessed unwavering loyalty to the cause of the Imperial Knights and was willing to die for his Emperor.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\" /> However, his loyalty, though unflinching, was not blind.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> Draco defied the orders of his Emperor on at least one occasion, when he and Ganner Krieg traveled to Vendaxa to rescue Princess Marasiah Fel from the Sith. This event caused Draco to wonder if the concept of loyalty could transcend obedience.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\" /> Following this incident, Draco was willing to accept any punishment that the Emperor would hand out<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\" /> and became more willing to obey his Emperor in the hope that it would persuade Fel to allow Draco to marry the princess Marasiah. Draco's loyalty was such that he unhesitatingly obeyed Fel's order to obtain the Muur Talisman from Celeste Morne and dismissed the objections of Krieg and Azlyn Rae that it was an evil Sith artifact which would corrupt their Emperor. On this occasion, Draco insisted that Imperial Knights always served the Emperor's will, but Ganner Krieg speculated that he was letting his desire to marry the Princess cloud his judgment. This occasion also saw Draco verbally quarrel with Krieg,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10\" /> who was normally his most trusted friend.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd\" />\n\nAlthough it was said that his personal feelings rarely interfered with his work,<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> Draco was openly critical of the Jedi and remarked on more than one occasion that Shado Vao was no match for an Imperial Knight, despite having bore witness to the Jedi's skills.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 7: Broken, Part 6\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 28: Vector, Part 9\" /> When meeting with Vao and other Jedi on Agamar to discuss an alliance against the Sith, Draco remained open to the idea of a security leak in the Jedi's ranks.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" /> His malice toward those who did not serve Fel's Empire also extended to bounty hunters,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 25: The Hidden Temple, Part 1\" /> members of the Galactic Alliance,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\" /> and those serving Darth Krayt's Empire. Draco had no moral qualms with killing members of the latter group, although fellow Imperial Knights Krieg<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10\" /> and Treis Sinde did.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 32: Fight Another Day, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 32|''Legacy'' (2006) 32]]</ref> When Marasiah was captured by the Sith on Agamar, it caused Draco a great deal of anger. He was advised by Krieg and Shado Vao to master his anger, but instead chose to use it to disguise himself as a Sith in order to rescue his love.<ref name=\"extremes2\" /> Darth Havok, Draco's former Imperial Knight Master, believed darkness to have always been inside of Draco, and Draco willingly drew on the dark side of the Force when dueling Havok on Korriban. However, Draco refused Havok's offer to join the Sith, insistent that he would rather die fighting.<ref name=\"extremes3\" />\n\nDraco's dedication to Fel was second to none, yet he knew that instinct and intuition were as important to an Imperial Knight as dedication and discipline. He believed that listening to the Force and heeding one's insights were paramount, and these beliefs helped craft him into a cunning, loyal, and very competent warrior. In spite of his brashness and cockiness, Draco was nearly incorruptible.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> However, his love for Marasiah could cause him to lose face and control of his emotions. Marasiah's brush with death on Vendaxa prompted Draco to threaten the lives of Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue and saw him punch Cade Skywalker in the face when the bounty hunter offered to heal Marasiah with the Force.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 7: Broken, Part 6\" /> When the Imperial Knights were attacked by forces of the One Sith on Agamar, Draco placed his duty to the Emperor over his duty to the Princess, ordering their escape shuttle to ferry Fel to safety when Marasiah had not yet boarded.<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" /> Although he ultimately chose to go to Korriban to rescue her, he was initially conflicted, feeling that he should perhaps remain on Bastion to help protect the Emperor. During his rescue mission, he was determined to get Marasiah out alive, and was unwilling to fail in his mission.<ref name=\"extremes2\" /> After rescuing her, he chose to remain on Korriban and buy her time to escape. He was willing to die, and believed that the will of the Force would decide his fate.<ref name=\"extremes3\" /> Although he did not die, he became a prisoner of the Sith, and, despite having to endure long periods of torture at the hands of Darth Havok, was unwilling to betray any Imperial secrets.<ref name=\"Legacy War 1\" /> He eventually betrayed the existence and location of the Jedi's Hidden Temple when he believed Marasiah's life to be in danger.<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" /> Draco did not ask for forgiveness, but he was willing to fight next to the Princess in an effort to regain his honor.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\" /> He felt himself unworthy of the Emperor's continued trust, but both Fel and Krieg continued to believe in him.<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\" /> When the Emperor fell to the dark side of the Force, Draco held true to his oath as an Imperial Knight and slew his liege.<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\" />\n\nFollowing the defeat of the One Sith, Antares Draco became the head of the Imperial Knights. In his new position, Draco was troubled by the shortage of seasoned Knights within the rank of his Order. He and his superior Empress Fel regarded the Knights as the personal representatives of the Galactic Triumvirate.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-2\" /> In the end, Draco and Fel rectified this shortage by appointing Master Yalta Val as the prefect of the [[Imperial Knights Training Facility]] on Coruscant. Val succeeded in boosting the Imperial Knights' numbers.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-12\" /> In the wake of the Carreras Incident, Draco viewed the rogue Sith Darth Wredd as a threat due to his role in the destruction of the Carreras communications array and the attempted murder of Master Val. He expressed unease at the Empress's decision, at the behest of Admiral Gar Stazi, to leave Darth Wredd alone to kill the One Sith infiltrators.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-5\" />\n\nAs an Imperial Knight, Draco regarded his fellow Knights as brothers and sisters in arms. He regarded the murder of the Imperial Knight [[Teemen Alton]] as a serious crime against his Order and vowed to bring justice to his fallen comrade.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-12\" /> Draco was convinced of the junk dealer [[Ania Solo]]'s guilt in the alleged murder of Alton until his fellow Knights Val and Jao Assam presented evidence that exonerated her. Due to his adherence to the rule of law, Draco was forced to release Ania. However, he did not hesitate to carry out the Empress' orders to imprison Jao for deserting the Imperial Knights, a charge which carried the death penalty.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-15\" /> When Ania tried to plead for clemency on Jao's behalf, Draco was confident that the Empress would not change her mind on that matter.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-16\" /> Draco's feelings towards Ania improved after she saved his life during the Battle of the Floating World and he allowed her to visit Empress Fel.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-18\" />\n\n===Relationships===\n====Marasiah Fel====\n{{Quote|That the person I cared about more than my vows as a Knight, than my fealty to your father, more than my loyalty to the Empire was in danger.

On one occasion, Draco claimed that he cared about her more than his vows as a Knight, his fealty to her father, or his loyalty to the Empire. His feelings for her were enough to prompt him to disobey the Emperor's orders when she was in danger<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\" /> and to unwaveringly obey his orders when doing so might convince the Emperor to let Draco marry her.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10\" /> After being told to forget the idea of marrying her,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\" /> Draco spent weeks sulking and, influenced by the Emperor, told Marasiah that he did not believe that they could pursue a relationship. She, however, had no intention of letting her father run her personal life and made it clear that his feelings for her were reciprocated.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 23: Loyalties, Part 1\" /> When Draco obeyed his duty to the Emperor and ferried Fel away from forces of the One Sith on Agamar, leaving Marasiah behind in the process,<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" /> it caused Draco a large amount of anger. He rescued her from the clutches of the Sith and was willing to die protecting her, at peace with the knowledge that his death would keep her safe.<ref name=\"extremes2\" /><ref name=\"extremes3\" /> Draco did not die, but was taken captive by the Sith, and only began telling them information about the Jedi when he believed Marasiah's life to be in danger.<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" />\n\nFollowing the defeat of the One Sith, Draco continued his relationship with Marasiah Fel. Fel viewed Draco as someone she could lean on during her moments of doubts and stress. On one occasion, he assured her that he had never known her to be anything less than strong after discussing the manpower shortages facing the Imperial Knights.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-2\" /> While Draco respected and loved his Empress, he still did not hesitate to disagree with her. On one occasion, he expressed concerns about her decision to leave the rogue Sith Darth Wredd alone.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-6\" /> Prior to the Battle of the Floating World, he advised his liege to remain aboard the Star Destroyer since without her, the Order would have nothing to fight for. Despite Fel's combat prowess and enthusiasm, she acquiesced to Draco's request; knowing her importance to the Imperial Knights. The bond between Draco and Fel was sufficient enough for the latter to enter the battlefield after Draco was attacked and wounded by a Sith combatant.<ref name=\"Legacy 2-18\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Come, you hounds of the dark!
