During the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction of the first Death Star]], Krelman visited [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Cantina]] and became infatuated with [[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena]], a [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] who worked the nighttime hours. After much consideration, Krelman&mdash;who had practically given up on life&mdash;returned to the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] days later and confronted the woman, professing his love for her and giving her flowers. She initially refused, but after all of the customers had left the cantina that night due to an imposed [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] curfew, Krelman remained behind with Ackmena, who didn't mind his company anymore.\n\nKrelman's talk with Ackmena was broadcast via the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] by the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Council]] as recommended viewing, with the intention being that Imperial citizens should strive to be of higher moral value than those on a world such as Tatooine.\n\n==Biography==\n===Six simple words===\n{{Quote|Come back soon, I'll be waiting.|Ackmena|The Star Wars Holiday Special}}\nKrelman was a [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]], advanced in years, who resided on the backwater [[Planet/Legends|world]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. With more digits on his hands than a [[Human/Legends|Human]], what made Krelman a unique [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] patron was the hole atop his head by which he drank.<ref name=\"HS\" />\n\nOne night sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Krelman visited [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Cantina]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. He was quite taken with [[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena]], the silver-haired nightshift bartender. Her parting words&mdash;\"Come back soon, I'll be waiting\"&mdash;had a profound impact on Krelman. He left the cantina with a renewed sense of purpose and felt more alive than he had in years. He went home and contemplated the meaning of Ackmena's words, and he decided that the message was particularly relevant to his life. After much consideration, Krelman decided to return to the cantina a few nights later.<ref name=\"HS\" />\n\n===Imperial notable and encountering Ackmena===\n{{Quote|I wasn't asking for love anymore. I wasn't desperate. I wasn't begging, whining, groveling, sniveling&hellip;|Krelman|The Star Wars Holiday Special}}\nIn order to reinforce the commitment of Imperial citizens, the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Council]] recommended that all viewers&mdash;and required that all members of the [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial forces]]&mdash;watch a live broadcast from Tatooine, due to the planet's lack of moral value. The broadcast began just before Krelman approached the Mos Eisley Cantina. He entered, dodging the bouncer [[Tork]], who was escorting out an unruly [[Abyssin/Legends|Abyssin]] patron named [[Cyceyed]]. Flowers in hand, Krelman scoped the cantina and found Ackmena standing at the bar. Reassuring that his flowers were properly potent, Krelman approached her and prompted her for a conversation. He was indifferent and unconcerned with his choice of beverage; rather, he was focused on the woman to whom he spoke. Krelman regretted not returning to visit her until that point, having contemplated doing so previously a number of times. While Ackmena tended to other customers, Krelman downed his drink through his upper-cranial orifice.<ref name=\"HS\" />\n\n[[File:Krelman_drinks.png|thumb|left|200px|Krelman takes a drink]]\n\nAs a gesture of his desire for Ackmena, he placed the flowers on top of his empty glass; Ackmena was flattered with the gift. Krelman reminded her of his name, grabbed her hand, and began to share his feelings: how he had lost all hope until he met Ackmena and thought she cared for him. He then spoke of love and, in a flicker of pseudoemotion, grabbed Ackmena in a fierce embrace. Taken aback, Ackmena had to explain to him that her words were not any sort of romantic proposition and that she had no time for such things. Unconvinced, Krelman took a seat next to [[Cebann Veekan]] at the bar and accepted another drink from Ackmena, complimentary this time. Krelman's hopes were dashed, however, when he heard Ackmena repeat, as Krelman called them, those \"six simple little words\" to another customer. He quickly became depressed as the realization of Ackmena's non-interest set in.<ref name=\"HS\" />\n\n===Curfew and a second chance===\nAt this point, the Empire announced an immediate curfew for the entire [[Tatoo system/Legends|Tatoo system]]. Ackmena tried to make the patrons leave and comply with the order, but none would. So Ackmena gave everyone one last round of drinks on the house and used her charm, through the song \"[[Goodnight, But Not Goodbye/Legends|Goodnight, But Not Goodbye]],\" to convince the customers to leave, which they did&mdash;all except for Krelman, whom Ackmena let stay inside after she locked up. Krelman again presented the flowers to Ackmena, who acted less reluctant, while the Imperial transmission came to a close.<ref name=\"HS\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Listen, Krelman, you're kind and sweet and terribly attractive, but if you're saying what I think you're saying you felt you meant I thought you needed to hear, then I just have one thing to say: I did not.|[[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena]] lets Krelman down|The Star Wars Holiday Special}}\nKrelman was a lonely man who had lived many years, through ups and downs, but had eventually come to believe it was all over&mdash;that was, until he saw Ackmena. Krelman interpreted a simple salutation to be an expression of love. Persistent, Krelman did not easily give up on pursuing Ackmena's affection.<ref name=\"HS\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|The late Harvey Korman co-starred as Ackmena's 11 fingered admirer Krelman, the techno-leptic 'Amorphiian' Dromboid and the four-armed Chef Gormaanda, the 'Julia Child of the Milky Way.'
