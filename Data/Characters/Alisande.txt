In [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], Alisande's husband signed the [[Concordat of Peace]] that ended generations of war with the [[Twelve Tribes of T'Syri\u00e9l]]. By that point, Alisande and Peacebringer already been [[Marriage/Legends|married]] for a number of years, having several children&mdash;their firstborn, a [[Aron Peacebringer's daughter|daughter]], died in infancy&mdash;and living together in a well-appointed palace in the city of [[Illyriaq\u00fcm]]. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Alisande's husband went out to investigate the sudden destruction of the city of [[K'avor]], and returned with [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], an important [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] leader who had recently crashed on Shiva IV.\n\nAlisande forged a close friendship with Organa, even as her husband grew attracted to the young offworlder&mdash;an attraction that Alisande recognized, but trusted Peacebringer to not act upon. As they attempted to get to the bottom of the destruction of K'avor, they were attacked by an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] force led by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Bentilais san Sk'ar]], coinciding with the one-year anniversary celebration for the Concordat of Peace.<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> With the help of Alliance reinforcements [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], along with Peacebringer's [[blood brother]] [[K\u00e9ral Longknife]], Peacebringer and Organa managed to defeat S'kar and fight off the Imperial menace. Peacebringer returned to Alisande afterwards, having let go of his feelings for Organa, and the two happily resumed their loving marriage.<ref name=\"marvel54\">[[Star Wars (1977) 54|''Star Wars'' (1977) 54]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|It is no crime to be tempted, Aron.

Above all, be wise when you make it.|Alisande|Star Wars (1977) 53}}\nAlthough Alisande's marriage to Aron Peacebringer had lasted long by 3 ABY, their relationship was still extremely passionate, with the two taking every opportunity to steal away for private encounters.<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> Their marriage brought Alisande a lifetime of happiness, and she held her husband's personal qualities of honesty and integrity in extremely high regard.<ref name=\"marvel54\" /> However, Alisande began to notice a change in Peacebringer after her husband met Leia Organa&mdash;he became forgetful, more distant, and seemed distinctly uncomfortable around their Alderaanian guest. She quickly realized his attraction to Organa, with whom Alisande had become close during her time on Shiva IV, considering her something akin to a daughter.

Alisande made two appearances in the original [[Star Wars (1977)|Marvel ''Star Wars'']] comic run, and her name was spelled differently in each appearance: \"Alisande\" in ''Star Wars 53'', and \"Alysande\" in [[Star Wars (1977) 54|''Star Wars'' (1977) 54]].
