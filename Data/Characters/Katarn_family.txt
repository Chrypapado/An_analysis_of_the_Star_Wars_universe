Morgan also had a younger sister.\n\n[[File:Morgankatarn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hologram/Legends|Hologram]] of [[Morgan Katarn]], the head of the Katarn family until his death.]]\nWhen Patricia died in an accident involving a faulty perimeter [[Droid/Legends|droid]], Morgan and Kyle were left to take care of the family farm. Eventually, Kyle entered the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]], while Morgan\u2014without Kyle's knowledge\u2014became involved in the local [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] militia in which he served as a low ranking leader. In an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] attack on Sulon led by [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]] and [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], Morgan was captured and later beheaded by Jerec himself. Upon learning what had happened to his father, Kyle, now a graduate of the Academy, deserted the Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance as a freelance [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]], teaming up with [[Jan Ors]], who eventually also became his love interest.\n\n[[File:Kyle_and_Jan.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] hero [[Kyle Katarn]] with [[Jan Ors]].]]\n\nWhat Kyle did not know was that Morgan was a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], something which Kyle had himself inherited. Kyle's [[The Force/Legends|Force]] skills lay dormant, until he returned to the Katarn farm on Sulon and found a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] revealing the truth about the Katarn legacy and its connection with the Force. Kyle would eventually rise to become a powerful [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] in [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[New Jedi Order]].\n\nMorgan also constructed a droid whom he called [[WeeGee]], who was stored in Morgan's workshop. He was found by Kyle, who took WeeGee with himself, stating that the droid was, apart from himself, the last surviving member of the Katarn Family.\n\n==Family tree==\n                  Unknown parents\n                         |\n       +-----------------------------------+\n       |                                   |\n +---[[Morgan Katarn]]--+--[[Patricia Katarn]]  Unknown female\n |              |\n [[WeeGee]]         |\n                |\n           [[Kyle Katarn]]\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*[[Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures (video game)|''Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures'']] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Purge: Seconds to Die]]'' {{Vision|[[Sha Koon]]}}\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]''\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama]]''\n*''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent]]''\n*''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent audio drama]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Lethal Alliance]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game]]'' {{Ret}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]''\n*''[[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight]]''\n*''[[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight audio drama]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith]]''\n*''[[N.R.I.
