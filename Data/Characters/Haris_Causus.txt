Due to Causus' value to the Empire, he was assigned four [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]], to accompany him whenever he went on excursions. Unknown to Causus or his bodyguards, they were monitored at all time by a team of skilled Imperial [[Agent/Legends|agents]] led by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Hadis Ato]], who were under orders to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Causus rather than let him fall into the hands of the Empire's enemies. During the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Causus covertly indicated his desire to defect to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and the Alliance sent a team of agents to Corulag, to extract him.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Causus, Haris}}\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Educators]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
