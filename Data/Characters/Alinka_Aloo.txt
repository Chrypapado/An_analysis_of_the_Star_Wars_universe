She lived in a [[Alinka Aloo's tower|tower]] on one of the highest levels of [[Coruscant]].<ref name=\"TMCAFOF\" />\n\nAt one point, the Emperor expressed interest in an ancient [[Dark side of the Force|evil]] [[book]] housed in a [[Unidentified Ushruu temple|temple]] on the [[planet]] [[Ushruu]]. Both Sim Aloo and his fellow adviser [[Janus Greejatus]] hoped to fetch it for their master, but Greejatus rushed the job, sending in a team of [[Trandoshan]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] who all ended up eaten by Ushruu's [[Corellian hound|snarler]] creatures. Alinka Aloo, however, devised a plan to help her father succeed where the other adviser had failed. Thinking the mission's requirements through, she determined that such a job needed a [[Wookiee]] to get through Ushruu's exotic [[forest]], a [[Librarian/Legends|librarian]] to fetch the book, and a [[cargo droid]] to carry it.<ref name=\"TMCAFOF\" />\n\nThe librarian she chose was [[Mayvlin Trillick]], an [[Oktarian]] girl who had been caught trying to steal from one of Sim Aloo's warehouses on Coruscant. Lady Alinka kept Trillick on a leash using the ''[[Mola Oktaro]]'', the Oktarans' most treasured book. For the Wookiee of the team, the lady chose [[Chewbacca]], the co-[[pilot]] of the [[Corellian]] smuggler [[Han Solo]]. As for the cargo droid, the Aloos did not pay much attention to robots, so the mission went to a [[K-2SO|K-2SB]], who reported for duty on his own.<ref name=\"TMCAFOF\" />\n\nIn order to recruit Chewbacca, Lady Alinka went to [[Level 1329]] of the [[Coruscant Underworld]], where she knew the Wookiee and Solo had docked a [[Standard week|week]] earlier. Handing them her card, she told them to visit her at the Aloo family's tower that night. When they did, the lady pretended that she needed Chewbacca to transport her pet [[tooka]]s to [[Centax 3]], agreeing to pay 25,000 [[credit]]s for the job. She insisted, however, that Solo should stay on Coruscant to keep her company during the mission. In fact, she planned on keeping Solo hostage to make sure that his co-pilot would perform the actual mission no matter the dangers.<ref name=\"TMCAFOF\" />\n\nOnce Trillick, Chewbacca and K-2SB were aboard the [[Freighter|cargo ship]], Lady Alinka revealed the real location and purpose of the mission, which Chewbacca reluctantly decided to follow to protect his friend's life. Although everything seemingly went according to plan, little did the lady know that her cargo droid was in fact K-2SO, an Imperial security droid that had been reprogrammed by [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]] of the anti-Empire [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. The droid's mission was to get a hold of the Ushruu book and bring it back to the Alliance.<ref name=\"TMCAFOF\" />\n\nWhen her crew finally came back, Alinka Aloo made a run for the landing pad, but when the cargo ship's doors opened, a group of angry, hungry snarlers from Ushruu lunged toward her and her [[bodyguard]]s. Solo took advantage of the situation to escape, taking the promised credits, a precious [[Junarian vase]], and the ''Mola Oktaro'' with him. As Lady Alinka was running toward her apartments, pursued by a snarler, Solo, Chewbacca, Trillick and K-2SO flew away in the cargo ship. Not only did Lady Alinka never obtain the book, but it ultimately fell into the hands of Cassian Andor.<ref name=\"TMCAFOF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlinka Aloo first appeared in [[Tom Angleberger]]'s junior novel ''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]'', which was published by [[Disney&ndash;Lucasfilm Press]]<ref name=\"TMCAFOF\" /> on [[May 25]], [[2018]].<ref name=\"Disney\">{{Disney|books|book/the-mighty-chewbacca-in-the-forest-of-fear|The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear|https://web.archive.org/web/20180527121832/http://books.disney.com/book/the-mighty-chewbacca-in-the-forest-of-fear}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]'' {{1st|[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!
