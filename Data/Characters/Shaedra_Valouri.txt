She was murdered after it was discovered that she helped her friend, [[Denell Kel'Vannon]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:ShaedraValouriMale.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Male depiction of Shaedra Valouri, deemed non-canon in Legends continuity]]\nShaedra Valouri was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]], prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"AED\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref><ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nBecause Shaedra Valouri spawned under the generic \"corsec_lieutenant\" template, her appearance was randomized under one of four possible depictions. She could either appear as a [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|haired]], brown [[Eye/Legends|eyed]] Human male wearing either an [[Officer/Legends|officer's]] [[Clothing/Legends|uniform]] or a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot's]] [[Jumpsuit/Legends|jumpsuit]], or as a brown haired, brown eyed Human female wearing either the officer's uniform or pilot's jumpsuit. Because the [[W:c:swg:Quest|quest]] dialogue identified Valouri as female, this article assumes that the Human female depiction is [[canon]] in the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity. However, the type of clothing she wore cannot be definitively determined.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Valouri, Shaedra}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
