Nobody flies the ''Starlight Intruder'' but me.|Salla Zend and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]|audio=Salla.ogg|Dark Empire (audio)}}\n'''Salla Zend''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who was the ex-girlfriend of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. She and cohort [[Shug Ninx]] later helped Solo and his wife [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senator]] [[Leia Organa Solo]] save [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and foil the reborn [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] plan to control the galaxy from [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] years after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] with her remarkably fast ship, the ''[[Starlight Intruder]]'' (which Zend often claimed was faster than the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], but in a number of races with the Falcon, the Intruder never came out on top).\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:StalightIntruder.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Salla's ''[[Starlight Intruder]]''.]]\nZend was originally a student with a true gift for fixing and modifying machinery, yet she didn't seek training to become an [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]] or a [[Technician/Legends|technician]], preferring to become a [[Starship/Legends|spaceship]] mechanic aboard a corporate vessel. Eventually, she saved up enough money for a loan, with which she bought her own ship.\n\nHer first time on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] was eventful, with her getting into a fight with a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] named \"[[Jump]],\" who tried to romance her at first, but then tried to be rough; his roughness only got him a dislocated shoulder. Tweaking out her vessel, the [[Rimrunner (Gymsnor-4)|''Rimrunner'']], Zend began repaying the debt by smuggling with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\">''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''</ref>\n\nShe was one of the many smugglers who fought in the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]] where she and [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] were partnered up. During the battle, she personally destroyed three [[Guardian-class light cruiser|''Guardian''-class light cruisers]] with her ship's [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missiles]].<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" />\n\nA race with Solo past a [[Neutron star/Legends|neutron star]] almost ended in disaster when her [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] failed and Solo nearly died rescuing her. Disturbed by the narrow miss, Zend wished to marry Solo, but he refused and said goodbye to her.<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\">''[[Rebel Dawn]]''</ref> She later partnered up with [[Shug Ninx]].<ref name=\"Dark Empire\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSalla Zend and the ''Starlight Intruder'' first appeared in the third issue of the ''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]'' series, [[Dark Empire 3|''The Battle for Calamari'']].\n\nVocal actress [[Glynnis Talken Campbell|Glynnis Talken]] played Salla in the [[1994]] [[Dark Empire (audio)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]]. In [[1995]], Talken acted out Salla again in the [[Dark Empire II (audio)|''Dark Empire II'' audio drama]].\n\nAlthough the first edition of ''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' would firmly establish Salla's [[Species/Legends|species]] as Human, she does have a \"purr\" and slight [[Alien/Legends|alien]] reverb to her voice in these audio adaptations.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:SallaZend-DEHandbook.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Salla with Shug Ninx]]\n\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 4]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*[[Dark Empire 3|''Dark Empire'' 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Empire 4|''Dark Empire'' 4]]\n*[[Dark Empire 5|''Dark Empire'' 5]]\n*[[Dark Empire 6|''Dark Empire'' 6]]\n*[[Dark Empire (audio)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire II]]''\n*[[Dark Empire II (audio)|''Dark Empire II'' audio drama]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine 16|''The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine'' 16]]\n*[[Dark Empire endnotes|''Dark Empire'' endnotes]]\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|12|The Women Of Star Wars}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Unusual Suspects]]''\n*{{FFCite|88|German Edition - ZEN1-2, ''Salla Zend''}}\n*{{FFCite|93|BYS2, ''Byss''}} {{Po}}\n*{{FFCite|133|INT1-2, ''Starlight Intruder''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|106|Han Solo: The Early Years}}\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Han|archivedate=20110903234809}}\n*{{DB|character|sallazend|Zend, Salla|archivedate=20100414034133}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Salla_Zend#Zend.2C_Salla Salla Zend|Salla Zend}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Salla Zend\n|de=Salla Zend\n|pl=Salla Zend\n|ru=\u0421\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0417\u0435\u043d\u0434\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zend, Salla}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
