His efforts put him at odds with [[Kisa Shaki]], who had taken over the [[Swift Hutt Spacer's Service Depot]] at the same time. As a result, supporters of both criminals began a gang war. The [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] attempted to bring the conflict to an end as a result.\n\nQes Dollis' efforts appear to have come to naught, as [[Talon Karrde]] was reported to have eventually inherited control of much of Jabba's smuggler contacts on Tatooine.\n\n==Personality==\nQes fancied himself a civilized businessbeing, intelligent, and charming.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n''Secrets of Tatooine'' makes it clear that Qes Dollis would not become a major figure in Tatooine's smuggling community, though only by inference, since Lady [[Valarian/Legends|Valarian's]] attempts to take over the smuggling business are said to have failed due to the smugglers joining with Karrde.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants|Dollis, Qes]]\n[[Category:Males|Dollis, Qes]]\n[[Category:Quarren|Dollis, Qes]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians|Dollis, Qes]]"}}}]}}}}
