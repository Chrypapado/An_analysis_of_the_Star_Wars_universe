During the [[Battle of Commenor (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Commenor]] his pilot was Lieutenant [[Caregg Oldathan]]. When elements of the [[Galactic Alliance Third Fleet]] launched a cloaked [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] at the planet, Danen and Oldathan investigated and discovered it. Realizing they could not hope to prevent it from colliding with their world, they pursued the ships responsible for the attack, hoping to exact vengeance and prevent the tactic from being used again.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Danen\n}}\n\n[[Category:Commenori]]\n[[Category:Confederation military personnel]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
