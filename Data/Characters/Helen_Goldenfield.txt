Roric had managed to capture and imprison some of the pirates in the basement of their home and had left to find an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]] to have them arrested. He left Helen to watch the pirates. While he was away, a [[Hero of Tatooine|spacer]], who was on a [[Quest of the Hero of Tatooine|quest]] for the [[Mark of Honor]], arrived at their house. Being a gracious host, Helen let the spacer in. She asked if they would watch the prisoners for her while she took a break. The spacer agreed. During this time, the pirates pleaded with the spacer to let them out, but they refused and informed Helen of their intent to escape. At this time, Roric had finally returned with two Imperial [[Exogen-class dark trooper|dark troopers]]. The troopers arrested the pirates and led them out of the house. Helen and her husband thanked the spacer for their assistance, and the spacer left.<ref name=\"SWG:TMotH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Helen.jpg|thumb|right|155px|One possible appearance for Helen]]\nHelen Goldenfield is an non-playable character in the [[2003]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.
