No matter how many frequency dampeners I surround myself with, I cannot get that one signal out of my head.|The Bith scientist|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] who worked as a '''scientist''' was present on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]], [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], during the final days of the [[Dark Wars]] in [[3951 BBY]]. A former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Meetra Surik]], met him in his [[Laboratory/Legends|laboratory]] in the [[Nar Shaddaa Docks]] and questioned him about what he was doing. The Bith [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] explained to her that he was trying to pinpoint the source of a signal that seemed to encompass the entirety of the moon. Surik offered her assistance to the scientist, who gave her a simple [[Courier/Legends|courier]] job: to pick up a package from one of his [[Unidentified Twi'lek part supplier|suppliers]], a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]], at one of the docking pylons. When Surik arrived to meet the Twi'lek, she found only his body and no package, and was attacked by a [[Utility droid|droid]]. When Surik returned to tell the scientist the news, she found only his dismembered [[Limb/Legends|arm]] clutching a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] with a message stating that he had found the signal source but was attacked by his assistant droid. Surik later learned that the [[Exchange]] crime syndicate leader [[G0-T0]] was the source of the signal.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] resided on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> during the closing stages of the [[Dark Wars]] in [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"CAMP\" /> [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], was exploring the [[Nar Shaddaa Docks]] and met the scientist in his apartment room, which the Bith had turned into a makeshift [[Laboratory/Legends|laboratory]]. Surik began questioning the scientist about what he was doing. The Bith explained the he was investigating a strange signal, and was using his equipment to tie into some [[Listening device/Legends|listening devices]] he had installed atop the docking pylons. He explained that his [[Species/Legends|species]] was able to detect much higher frequencies than [[Human/Legends|Humans]] and that no matter how many signal dampeners he surrounded himself with, he could not get the signal out of his head.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nThe Bith scientist claimed that if it were not for his knowledge of such things, he probably would not have been able to detect the signal, and that due to his familiarity with such technologies, he was unable to tune it out like other Bith probably could. He noted that whatever was generating the signal had to be enormous, as it was surrounding the entire moon, and that the signal was unique in that it was buried among a myriad of other signals and background noises. The Bith speculated that whomever was generating this signal wanted to keep it as secret as possible.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nSurik asked if there was any way she could help, and the Bith replied that he did need a [[Courier/Legends|courier]] to pick up an important part for his equipment from a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Unidentified Twi'lek part supplier|supplier]] of his at docking pylon three on the docks, as he did not have the [[Time/Legends|time]] to leave his work. He offered Surik his thanks and 200 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Surik accepted and headed to the pylon, but upon arriving, she only found the [[Death/Legends|corpse]] of the Twi'lek. She inspected the body but was unable to locate the part. The pylon door then suddenly sealed shut and a [[Utility droid|cleaning droid]] in the pylon attacked her.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nAfter destroying the [[Droid/Legends|droid]], Surik returned to the Bith's laboratory, only to find his severed [[Limb/Legends|arm]] clutching a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] with a message stating that he had discovered the source of the signal but was immediately attacked by his lab assistant droid. [[G0-T0]], the leader of the [[Exchange]] crime syndicate's operations on Nar Shaddaa, later admitted to Surik to being the source of the unknown signal, which he claimed he used for relaying commands and information.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThe Bith was very preoccupied when he was working, and was reluctant to speak of his work to strangers. During his exchanges with Surik, the Bith referred to his home of Nar Shaddaa as a planet, rather than its true designation as a moon.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nThe Bith was a scientist who specialized in high frequency signals and the technology that went into creating and detecting them. He had the natural ability to detect these signals, but unlike other members of his species, he was unable to simply tune out certain signals due to his extensive knowledge of them.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Bith scientist appears in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' by [[Obsidian Entertainment]]. He appears in a room within a series of apartments off the docks on Nar Shaddaa. The player can visit his room and receive a side quest from him. While the player is not required to start this quest or even talk to the Bith, completing the quest increases the Exchange's notice of the player's activities on the moon. The events of the quest can also be used later when talking to G0-T0 to get him to admit he is a droid. The Bith is named simply \"Bith Scientist\" in the game and shares the same model with all other Bith characters.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bith]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
