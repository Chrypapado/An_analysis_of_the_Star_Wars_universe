One of Arani's contacts came up with the location of the group after a couple of days. There, they found a hidden smuggler's base led by [[Saidle Frex]]. They defeat Frex and his gang and rescued the abducted archeology professor [[Tasrah Boh]] in the process.<ref name=\"SoN\">{{GamerCite|2|The Predators}} and {{WizardsCite|url=starwars/article.asp?x=rpg_fastPlay_intro|text=Smugglers of Naboo Fast-Play Game|int=Smugglers of Naboo Fast-Play Game|archivedate=20090902233104}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 16, she played a role in defending Naboo from [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] forces in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] as a member of the [[Naboo Underground]],<ref name=\"IoTAG\">''[[Star Wars: Invasion of Theed Adventure Game]]''</ref> and the [[Naboo Resistance]].<ref name=\"FF91\">{{FFCite|91|TRA17-18, ''The Trade Federation Attack''}}</ref> A decade later, Arani found herself in the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], watching a holographic representation of a battle, while [[Kelko]] surveyed the action with a pair of [[Electrobinoculars/Legends|electrobinoculars]].<ref name=\"CWCG\">''[[The Clone Wars Campaign Guide]]''</ref> After the fall of the Republic, she and Kelko were seen on an Imperial city, trying to distract an Imperial while her [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] companion tried to get away.<ref name=\"TFUCG\">''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of the Empire, Arani's previous experience with Jedi with the Naboo underground and the academy lead her to help a number of Jedi escape the initial portions of the Jedi purge. Her time with the Naboo Resistance also lead to her relative, [[Tavin Korden|Tavin]], to place her in charge of the security of the family business: [[Korden Outfitting and Surveying]].
