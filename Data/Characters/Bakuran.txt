Due to their relative isolation, and decades of independence from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], they developed a culture distinct from the rest of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] before their conquest by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\">''[[The Truce at Bakura]]''</ref>\n\n==History==\nMost Bakurans were descended from the [[Bakur Mining Corporation]]'s colonists, who arrived on Bakura in [[150 BBY/Legends|150 BBY]]. Soon afterwards, the Bakurans became independent of corporate control, setting up a [[Bakuran Senate]] and electing [[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Ministers]]. The descendants of [[Deredith Arden]], the leader of the Bakur Mining Corporation's expedition, were the heads of the Bakuran government. The first major crisis in their history was a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Bakuran droid uprising|uprising]] in [[97 BBY]].<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nThey were used as a base during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], but only for a short period of time. They remained neutral during this conflict,<ref name=\"Star Wars Republic 72\">[[Republic 72|''Republic'' 72]]</ref> more concerned with internal disputes. By [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], these disputes left Bakura open to conquest by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Though there was a short period of resistance, the Bakurans were subjugated until [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], when they joined with forces from the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] to expel both the invading [[Ssi-Ruu]]k and the Imperial forces during the [[Invasion of Bakura]].<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />\n\nThe Bakurans became supporters of the fledgling [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], but reasserted their idependence by [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]]. Even then, they supported the New Republic during the [[Corellian Crisis]], sending the [[Bakuran Defense Fleet]] to fight on the New Republic's side during the [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Corellian Crisis)|Battle of Centerpoint Station]].<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\">''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''</ref> Though they also fought a renewed Ssi-Ruuk offensive alongside the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] during the [[Battle of Bakura (28 ABY)|battle at Bakura]], the Bakurans continued their tradition of independence.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''</ref>\n\n==Culture<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\" />==\nDue to the isolation of their homeworld, Bakurans had little contact with nonhumans other than the [[Kurtzen]], Bakura's indigenous people. This, combined with the invasion of the [[Ssi-Ruu]]k, brought out an unfortunate [[Speciesism|xenophobic]] streak in many Bakurans, especially towards the most alien-looking nonhumans. Bakurans were also [[Anti-Droid sentiment|uneasy]] around droids, as a result of the droid uprising in 97 BBY.\n\nMost Bakurans followed the teachings of the [[Cosmic Balance]], a religion that held that every action in the universe had an equal and opposite reaction elsewhere (for example, if one person's life improved, another's life would have to become worse.) This also led them to be suspicious of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] order, whose power they believed created an imbalance in the universe which required great evil to correct it.\n\nBakurans were noted for their [[Starship/Legends|starship]] and [[Repulsorcraft/Legends|repulsorcraft]] innovations. It was repulsorlift factories which initially attracted the Empire to take control of Bakura. Repulsorcraft were so ubiquitous on their homeworld, that even ordinary furniture was replaced by [[repulsorchair]]s.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Death Star (novel)|''Death Star'']]\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']] {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|6|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[A Forest Apart]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]''\n*''[[Assault at Selonia]]''\n*''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*''[[Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[C-3PO: Tales of the Golden Droid]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bakuraner\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bakurans| ]]\n[[Category:Human races]]\n[[Category:Planetary cultural groups]]"}}}]}}}}
