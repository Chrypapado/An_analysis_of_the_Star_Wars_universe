He was fat and grotesque and therefore often posed as Jabba for public functions. He also operated a small luxury cruise business on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] that capitalized on [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] infamy after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. His sail barge, ''[[Dune Princess]]'', was constructed to be nearly identical to Jabba's personal sail barge [[Khetanna/Legends|''Khetanna'']], though he made sure to keep it smaller as a point of respect to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. Jabba ordered that Heater hire bounty hunters to pursue [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] after the death of [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Opunmcgrrrr.jpg|thumb|left|Declan Mulholland as \"Jabba\".]]In the [[Star Wars (radio)|radio adaptation]] of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], a scene is included where Heater (voiced by [[Joel Brooks]]) confronts [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] at [[Docking Bay 94/Legends|Docking Bay 94]]. This scene is very similar to the scenes deleted from the film with [[Declan Mulholland]] playing a [[Human/Legends|Human]] \"Jabba\", as well as a scene with \"Jabba the Hut\" ''(sic)'' in [[Star Wars (1977) 2|''Star Wars'' (1977) 2]]. After the [[1997]] release of the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|\"Special Editions\"]] [[retcon]]ned these scenes to feature Jabba himself, these scenes were removed from [[canon]].\n\nHeater is most likely the same character as the [[The Fat Man|Fat Man]] from [[Timothy Zahn]]'s ''[[Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade]]'', as their characterizations and backstory are identical.<ref name=\"EGC\">''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'', page 79.</ref><ref name=\"Sleight of Hand\">''[[Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade]]''</ref> Heater appeared in ''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' in [[November]] [[1995]] and the Fat Man was published in ''[[Tales from Jabba's Palace]]'' two months later, in [[January]] [[1996]]. [[Andy Mangels]], writer of the ''Essential Guide'', has said that he drew information from manuscripts and novels that were not yet published,<ref name=\"TFN Andy Mangels\">{{Cite_web|url=http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/mangels.asp|title=Jedi Council - Interviews - Andy Mangels|author=Paul Ens|date=1999-08-0|work=Interviews - Face To Face With The Masters|publisher=[[TheForce.net]]|archivedate=20190730114027}}</ref> and given that [[Melina Carniss|another character]] conceived by Zahn appeared in the guide, it's extremely likely that some level of coordination occurred and the matching descriptions of Heater and the Fat Man aren't mere coincidence.<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n\nIt has been speculated by some fans that since the early [[Star Wars (1977)|''Marvel Star Wars'']] appearances of Jabba the Hutt were based on [[Mosep Binneed/Legends|Mosep Binneed]], a [[Nimbanel/Legends|Nimbanel]] later identified as Jabba's accountant, \"Heater\" and \"Jabba the Hut\" were actually aliases used by Binneed. It has also been speculated that Heater was a Human who resembled the \"Human Jabba\" portrayed by Mulholland. Mulholland's likeness was later used on the [[2013 Topps Star Wars Illustrated: A New Hope]] trading cards that featured Heater. Previously, his appearance in the deleted scene had been used as the physical description of a different character, [[Opun Mcgrrrr]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' radio drama]] {{C|[[retcon]]ned, now non-[[canon]]}}\n*{{Journal|4|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Live-Action Adventures]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2013 Topps Star Wars Illustrated: A New Hope|cardname=Han, Heater and the Falcon|link=https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/87473/cid/6296525/2013-Topps-Star-Wars-Illustrated-A-New-Hope-58-Han,-Heater-and-the-Falcon|archivedate=20211002174115}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
