At the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the Republic was [[Declaration of a New Order|reformed]] into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. The new government was hostile to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and began [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|hunting them down]]. Jorad became a wanted man, and he was captured by members of the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]], a group of [[Dark Side Adept]]s who served the Empire as [[Jedi hunter/Legends|Jedi hunters]]. They turned Jorad to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and he himself became an Inquisitor. Jorad was sent to carry out his new duties on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Prakith/Legends|Prakith]], where the [[Citadel Inquisitorius|headquarters]] of the Inquisitorius was located. He carried out patrols in the planet's [[Capital/Legends|capital]], [[Prak City]], where he searched for [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-users. When a team of [[Alderaanian Resistance]] agents traveled to Prakith to free [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Denia]], who had been captured by the Inquisitorius, Jorad located the agents in Prak City. He engaged them in combat and attempted to capture them.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|My time away from the Citadel is seldom rewarding, but something tells me that you will make this a very interesting trip! ''Very interesting ''indeed''.|Jorad|Sword of the Empire}}\nJorad was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] born during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] who joined the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Within the Order, he became a [[Jedi Guardian]],<ref name=\"Sword\" /> a combat-orientated [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] specialization.<ref name=\"Roleplaying\">''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook]]''</ref> However, in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], the leader of the Republic, issued [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] to the Republic's [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], calling for the execution of the Jedi. The Republic was [[Declaration of a New Order|reformed]] into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> but Jorad was able to survive the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Jedi purge]] that the new government subsequently implemented. However, he was eventually captured by members of the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]], an order of [[Dark Side Adept]]s who served the Empire as [[Jedi hunter/Legends|Jedi hunters]]. They turned Jorad to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and he joined their order, taking up the title of \"Inquisitor.\" Jorad was assigned to begin carrying out his new duties on [[Prakith/Legends|Prakith]], a [[Planet/Legends|planet]] located in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] region of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], where the Inquisitorius was based. His role there was to patrol the planetary [[Capital/Legends|capital]], [[Prak City]], to locate any [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-[[Force-sensitive/Legends|users]] there. He took any whom he found to the [[Citadel Inquisitorius]], the headquarters of the Inquisitorius, for questioning.<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\nAfter Inquisitor [[Valin Draco]] imprisoned [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Denia]] in the Citadel<ref name=\"Sword\" /> around [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">The ''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'' module ''[[Echoes of the Jedi]]'' states that the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vhiin Thorla]] traveled to the [[Almas Academy]] two [[Standard year/Legends|years]] after the declaration of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], which is dated to [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. This thus indicates that ''Dawn of Defiance'' is set in circa 17 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|BBY]].</ref> the [[Alderaanian Resistance]]&mdash;a group of anti-Imperial rebels from the planet [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]&mdash;sent a group of agents to Prakith to rescue her. They passed through the [[Work Zone sector]] of Prak City, where Jorad was patrolling aboard a [[Theta-class T-2c shuttle/Legends|''Theta''-class shuttle]] along with a [[Prak City Guard Squad]]. After Jorad detected the presence of the agents, he planned to arrest them. The [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] swooped down toward a clearing where the Resistance team was standing, and Jorad and the guards disembarked. The shuttle then took off again, and Jorad approached the Resistance agents while his guards flanked him on all four sides. Jorad introduced himself to the rebels and attempted to arrest them; however, they resisted, and he ignited his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and engaged them in combat.<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJorad was prideful, which made him vulnerable to the dark side and allowed him to easily adapt to the role of an Inquisitor. He was also ambitious, and when he was assigned to serve on Prakith, he hoped to make a significant arrest so that he could get off patrol duty and take up a more important position in the Citadel Inquisitorius. In an attempt to achieve this, he used all forms of trickery and deception that were available to him to capture Force-users alive.<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\nAs an Inquisitor, Jorad wore red- and black-colored robes, the standard uniform for members of his order. He also carried a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], a [[Homing beacon/Legends|tracking device]], and a [[Code cylinder/Legends|code cylinder]], which could be used to activate an elevator in the Citadel Inquisitorius.<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJorad was able to use [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]] to move people and objects, and he also knew how to use [[Mind trick/Legends|mind tricks]] to influence the minds of his opponents. He was bilingual and had the ability to speak both [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] and [[Bocce/Legends|Bocce]].<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\nWhen attacking a Force-user, one of Jorad's favored tactics was to hide or feint. This allowed him to draw his opponent closer to him so that he could use the Force to knock them over and then engage them in melee combat. He would also capture weak, non-Force-sensitive opponents to use as hostages. When in melee combat, Jorad would attack targets with both his lightsaber and a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]].<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJorad was created by writer [[John Jackson Miller]] and made his first and only appearance in ''[[Sword of the Empire]]'', the ninth scenario in the ''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'' campaign, a [[Wizards of the Coast]] online supplement to the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]''.<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\nIn the supplement, Jorad's encounter with the players, who [[Roleplaying game|role-play]] as the team of Resistance agents, can begin in a number of ways. When they arrive in Prak City, if any of them use the Force while they are there, the Inquisitorius detect this and Jorad is sent to investigate. If the players fail to trigger the encounter with Jorad this way, it occurs after they have met with the [[Stereb]] [[Herdr'tui]], when Jorad finds them during a random search of the [[City/Legends|city]]. If the players defeat Jorad, they can take his code cylinder and use it later in the scenario to assist them in gaining entry to the Citadel Inquisitorius.<ref name=\"Sword\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=Sword of the Empire|int=Sword of the Empire|archivedate=20100118064618}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fallen Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Inquisitors]]\n[[Category:Jedi Guardians]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi]]\n[[Category:Prakith residents]]"}}}]}}}}
