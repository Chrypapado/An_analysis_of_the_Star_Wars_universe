He was invited into the house of the [[Batuuan]] woman [[Elise]], which caused her husband, [[Menir]], to fly into a rage and attack him. Iren left the house, leaving behind a small bag containing three seeds. Menir threw the seeds outside, where they would eventually sprout into monstrous creatures called [[Drengir]]. After the Drengir had destroyed Menir's home and killed Elise, Iren returned to the ruins and confronted Menir, telling him that his bitterness was to blame for what had happened.<ref name=\"ABH\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=A Bitter Harvest|book=Dark Legends}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
