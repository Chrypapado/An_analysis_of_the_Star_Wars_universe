He later became a famous bounty hunter, sired two sons, and became a leader of his clan. He was murdered by his arch rival, [[Navik|Navik the Red]].\n\n==Biography==\nGreedo lived on [[Rodia/Legends|Rodia]], becoming a successful [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], marrying and siring two sons. As an adult, Greedo began to look upon the traditional Rodian hunts as foolishness, and despite his feared reputation, Greedo refused to join in the gladiatorial combat that his people engaged in.<ref name=\"A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)\">''[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)]]''</ref>\n\nAfter a successful career hunting criminals and outlaws, Greedo came to a violent end when his first-born son was young, dying in the purges of [[Navik|Navik the Red]].\n\nGreedo's pregnant wife [[Neela]], along with his son and [[Greedo/Legends|namesake]], and brothers-in-law [[Nok (Rodian)|Nok]] and [[Teeku]], fled Rodia. Greedo's son sought to emulate his father by claiming the bounty on [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], but died as violently as the first Greedo had.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Greedoelderdeath.jpg|thumb|200px|The death of Greedo the Elder.]]\n\nThe original intention was that the Greedo scuffling with Anakin Skywalker in the scene that was cut from [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']] and later included as part of the bonus material on the DVD, would be the same Greedo seen in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], and that Wald's prediction would foreshadow Greedo's death at the hands of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. [[George Lucas]] also stated in the commentary for the deleted scene that this was the same Greedo that appeared in ''A New Hope''. However, in order to keep the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] backstory developed for the ''A New Hope'' character intact, later references have retconned the Rodian who fought with Anakin as Greedo the Elder.<ref name=\"NEGC\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> However, in 2010, following the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' episode [[Sphere of Influence]], which also featured Greedo, it was re-retconned that the Greedo in ''The Phantom Menace''{{'s}} deleted scene is indeed the very same Greedo of ''A New Hope''.<ref name=\"Chee\">[http://forums.starwars.com/message.jspa?messageID=17933823#17933823 Leland Chee confirms the re-retcon, October 4th, 2010]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)|''A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale'' webstrip]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{1stID}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/the-not-so-magnificent-seven|text=The Not-So Magnificent Seven|int=The Not-So Magnificent Seven}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Greedo der \u00c4ltere\n|hu=Id\u0151sebb Greedo\n|nl=Greedo the Elder\n|ru=\u0413\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0439\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Tetsu Clan]]"}}}]}}}}
