He fled to [[Sarafur]], where he was buried in a treasure-filled crypt with a [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocron]]. Millennia later, [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Jilst Bindalin]] brought the [[Alsakan Tessent]] to the Killik's tomb, following a [[Shistavanen/Legends|Shistavanen]] legend of the Killik Sith Lord.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThis individual's possible involvement in the abortive Killik [[Battle of Korriban (Killik Invasion)|invasion]] of [[Korriban]] would explain his connection with the Sith.\n\nThe description of this [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] contains a continuity error, in that he acts as an individual as opposed to part of a hive (although the concept was only created in the ''[[Star Wars: The Dark Nest Trilogy|Dark Nest Trilogy]]'', three years after the publishing of [[Star Wars Gamer 9|this issue]] of [[Star Wars Gamer|''Gamer'']]). It's possible that he may have been an outcast; exiled by his hive, specifically for being single-minded. Similar situations have been known to occur among the [[Insectoid/Legends|insectoid]] [[Bartokk]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|9|Race for the Tessent}} {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Alsakanians]]\n[[Category:Killiks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pre-Republic]]\n[[Category:Sith Lords]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Sith]]"}}}]}}}}
