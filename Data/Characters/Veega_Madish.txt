After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he was based on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] planet [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] and primary operated out of [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena's]] [[Tyrena cantina|cantina]].<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" />\n\n[[File:Cal_Handro_crashed_ship.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Cal Handro]]'s crashed ship on Rori.]]\nAround [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Cal Handro]], was shot down above [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]\u2019s moon of [[Rori/Legends|Rori]].<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" /> The pilot was transporting a new kind of [[Syren spice|spice]] for the Rebel Alliance when he was attacked and crash-landed on the moon.<ref name=\"SWG:MtYBF\">{{SWGcite|exp=JtL|type=other}}Quest: \"More than You Bargained For\"</ref> The Alliance was very concerned about Handro's cargo and Veega Madish was ordered to lead an investigation.<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" />\n\nVeega Madish assembled a group of spacers on Corellia and sent them readily on Rori to search for Cal Handro. It appeared that the man had survived the crash but he had vanished in the wilderness. The spacers successfully localized the crash site of Cal Handro's ship, in the [[Madyn Plains]] of Rori, but did not find any trace of the smuggler, only [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] henchmen also looking for the missing pilot. The spacers managed to collect Handro's [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] and a sample of spice and brought it back to Veega Madish. The officer then requested the spacers to bring the spice to a medic, [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Edvar Vang]], for analyze. In fact, Vang already knew the existence of that spice but he was too afraid to provide any information. He suggested the spacers to meet his friend [[Moxxar Krieg]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] but the latter was found murdered at [[Moxxar Krieg's house|his place]].<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" /> In the meantime, spacers working for [[Tyla Jinn]], one of Handro's friend, and for Imperial officer [[Jevan Monsul]] also searched for the missing pilot on Rori.<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" />\n\n[[File:BlackSunBase.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Black Sun bunker]] on Rori.]]\nA short time later, a woman by the name [[Kaila Min]], a regular at the Gambling Hall in [[Narmle (city)|Narmle]], contacted Veega Madish and pretended she saw Cal Handro in the wilderness of Rori. The spacers rushed to the pilot's last known location, only to be attacked by Black Sun minions. From their attackers, they obtained the location of the [[Black Sun bunker|Black Sun base]] on Rori. The spacers then raided the base but did not find Handro there.<ref name=\"SWG:MtYBF\" />\n\nVeega Madish later learnt that Cal Handro had met the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] [[Wire]] on [[Talus/Legends|Talus]]. The Bothan informed the spacers that the smuggler was wanted dead by [[Trussk]], a slavemaster of the [[Blackscale Clan/Legends|Blackscale Clan]] who considered that Handro was interfering in their business by shipping [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] for a rival [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] clan. The spacers then assaulted [[Trussk's house|Trussk's fortress]] on Naboo but, again, they did not find Handro.<ref name=\"SWG:Gc\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=other}}Quest: \"Getting closer?\"</ref>\n\n[[File:MartanoEstate2.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Black Sun enforcers besieging the Martano estate.]]\nFinally, Cal Handro was localized at the [[Martano estate]], on Rori. Veega Madish thus tasked the spacers to encounter the wealthy gambler [[Tierce Martano]] in order to convince him to hand over the pilot to the Alliance. Since Martano was a powerful man, the Rebel officer preferred to avoid any conflict with him. However, when they arrived at the estate, the place was besieged by Black Sun enforcers. While the spacers attacked the criminals, Martano sent a distress alert to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance because he knew that both factions were looking for the smuggler. The adventurers finally managed to kill all Black Sun forces and met Tierce Martano. As the gambler wished to get rid of Handro as soon as possible, he eagerly accepted to give the location of Handro to the spacers.<ref name=\"SWG:WYG\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=other}}Quest: \"Within Your Grasp\"</ref>\n\nAlthough the hunt for Handro was coming to an end, Veega Madish was suddenly reassigned. In fact, Cal Handro was now considered as a traitor for having smuggled slaves and the Alliance wanted to capture him. Rebel Officer [[Wolff Kalos]] was designated to investigate the case and Madish advised the spacers to report to him as soon as possible.<ref name=\"SWG:WYG\" /> Cal Handro was eventually killed in his [[Cal Handro's Warlord Heavy Cruiser|starship]] during a space battle between Imperial and Rebel forces in the [[Naboo system/Legends|Naboo system]].<ref name=\"SWG:FtA\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=other}}Quest: \"For the Alliance!\"</ref><ref name=\"SWG:FtE\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=other}}Quest: \"For the Empire!\"</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:VeegaMadish.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two of many potential, randomly-generated depictions of Veega Madish.]]\nVeega Madish was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]].<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" /> The game was shut down on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Veega Madish was added to the game with the first chapter of the \"[[W:c:swg:Secrets of the Syren|Secrets of the Syren]]\" questline, released with the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 14 Notes for 9 March 05|Publish 14]]\", on [[March 9]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/board/message?board.id=swgpatchnotes&message.id=730|text=Update Notes: Publish 14.0 - March 9, 2005|archivedate=20051113081026}}</ref> The \"Secrets of the Syren\" story arc was removed from the game with the \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]], due to the major changes planed for Rori with the introduction of the [[Battle of Restuss]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\nDue to the nature of some characters in ''Galaxies'', Veegoa Madish's appearance was randomized during each server reset.
