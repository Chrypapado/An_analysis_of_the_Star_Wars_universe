He was divorced from his wife. Shortly before the [[Coronet City revolution]], Erno apprehended a [[human]] youth named [[Remi]], who was a member of the [[Acolytes of the Beyond]]. Before Erno could finish booking him, he and his fellow detectives were distracted by the Acolytes' attack on Coronet City. Remi then slipped away and obtained a [[Sith]] [[lightsaber]] from the downstairs archive. After discovering that the Acolyte [[Kiza]] had gunned down several of his colleagues, Erno tried to confront her. However, Remi sliced off his [[blaster]] hand with his lightsaber. Kiza then spared Erno so that he could warn the others about the Acolytes.\n\n==Biography==\nErno was a detective in the [[Coronet City Peace and Security]] department following the [[Battle of Endor]]. Erno was divorced from his wife, who lived with a pair of artists in the [[Teeno Village district]]. He was posted at a [[Peace and Security Headquarters|Peace and Security station]] prior to the [[Coronet City revolution]]. Shortly before the [[Acolytes of the Beyond]] attacked Coronet City, Erno arrested a [[human]] youth<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> named [[Remi]],<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref> who called himself [[Remi|Oblivion]]. Erno caught the boy spraying an image of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] with the message \"VADER LIVES\" on the wall of the police station. Regarding the youth as a vandal, Erno took him into an interrogation room for booking.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWhen Remi expressed defiance and claimed that Vader lived, Erno pointed out that the former [[Sith Lord]] had perished about the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] above [[Endor]]. Erno dismissed Remi's remark that death was not the end. When Erno asked the boy his name, Remi responded that he was called Oblivion. Erno then tried to offer the boy leniency if he would name his fellow Acolytes. When Remi remained silent, Erno dismissed his group as a \"buncha suck-ups\" for the Empire. Erno then responded that the Acolytes were serving something greater than the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nErno then asked Remi why he did not wear a mask and suggested that the Acolytes were fans of Vader. Remi responded by asking Erno whether he was a decent man. Unwilling to let the boy pry into his personal life, Erno asked the boy about the mask again. Remi responded that the Acolytes had to earn their masks. Remi added that the building was very old and hinted that he knew that the Peace & Security station shared the basement with the library next door. Before Erno could continue the interrogation, the security officer [[Spob Rydel]] entered the interrogation room to inform Erno that the Acolytes were attacking parts of Coronet City.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWhen Rydel suggested roughing up their prisoner, Erno agreed and returned to the cell to fetch Remi. However, the prisoner had escaped. At that point, the lights went out. After the emergency lights had kicked in, Erno witnessed Rydel and the detectives [[Shreen]] and [[Mursey]] being gunned down by the [[Pantoran]] [[Kiza]], another Acolyte who had disguised herself as a secretary. When Erno demanded to know what was going on, Kiza replied that she was not his doll. He tried to shoot her with his blaster but Remi returned and sliced off his blaster hand with an ancient [[Sith]] [[lightsaber]] he had retrieved from the underground archives. Kiza then clubbed the wounded Erno in the head and told him that Vader lived and to tell the others that the Acolytes were coming.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nErno was a [[Gender|male]] [[Corellian]] detective who regarded himself as a scruffy thick-neck. Erno did not regard himself as a good person due to his estranged relationship with his wife, who had left him to live with two artists in the [[Teeno Village district]]. His neighbors regarded him as a slob. Erno also imagined that the fish in his fish tank gave him the dubious look every morning when he left for work. Erno was also known to chew [[rubber-root]], which he regarded as a better substitute than smoking [[stimstick]]s.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nErno regarded Darth Vader as a bad man and thought that he was a machine. Erno dismissed the Acolyte Remi's claim that Darth Vader still lived despite the Battle of Endor. He regarded the Acolytes of the Beyond as a group of criminals and trouble-makers. Erno also treated the Pantoran Kiza like a doll and did not suspect that she was an undercover Acolyte. As a detective and peace officer, Erno knew how to wield a [[blaster]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nErno first appeared in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2016]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', the second installment in ''[[Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Erno\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Detectives]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
