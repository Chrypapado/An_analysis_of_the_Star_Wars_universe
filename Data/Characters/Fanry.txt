After her coronation, Fanry planned to lead a revolt against [[Czerka Arms]], opposing the corporation's influence in the [[Pijal system]]. She also intended to act without the support of the [[Jedi Order]] or the Republic, convinced the latter was compromised by Czerka Corporation's wealth and [[Politics|influence]]. As queen, she believed it was her responsibility to free her [[planet]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nBut while attempting to destroy the [[Branch-class vehicle|Czerka Corporation cruiser]] ''[[Leverage]]'', Fanry refused to help the [[Slavery|slaves]] on board the [[starship]]. As a result, her servant [[Cady]] and the crew of the royal [[flagship]] [[Heavenly Sphere|''Righteous'']] rebelled against the queen. The queen's revolution was unsuccessful, consequently leading to Fanry's abdication of the [[throne]]. The [[crown]] therefore passed to her cousin [[Lamia]], who signed a treaty abolishing slavery in the [[Pijali]]'s [[Homeworld|home]] [[Star system|system]] and ending the [[Pijali monarchy]]. Fanry was sentenced to four years of house arrest for her crimes.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFanry first appeared in the [[canon]] novel ''[[Master & Apprentice]]'', which was written by [[Claudia Gray]] and published in [[2019]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Gray imagined Fanry as being portrayed by actress [[Wikipedia:Sadie Sink|Sadie Sink]].<ref name=\"Tumblr\">{{Tumblr|tumblrurl=claudiagray|url=post/184227180172/im-just-now-leaving-chicago-after-celebration|tumblrname=Claudia Gray's Photo Blog|postname=Claudia Gray|quote=Sadie Sink as Fanry|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416223629/http://claudiagray.tumblr.com/post/184227180172/im-just-now-leaving-chicago-after-celebration}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]'' {{Imo}} {{Flash}}\n*[[Dooku: Jedi Lost (script)|''Dooku: Jedi Lost'' script]] {{Imo}} {{Flash}}\n*''[[Master & Apprentice]]'' {{1st|[[Master & Apprentice (audiobook)|''Master & Apprentice'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Master & Apprentice (audiobook)|''Master & Apprentice'' audiobook]] {{1st|''[[Master & Apprentice]]''}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Fanry}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[The Star Wars Book]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Fanry\n|fr=Fanry\n|ru=\u0424\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Pijali]]\n[[Category:Queens]]"}}}]}}}}
