I'll show you darkness!|Queen Amanoa, to Beast Lord Oron Kira|audio=Amanoa1-TOTJ.ogg|Tales of the Jedi (audio)}}\n'''Amanoa''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] from the [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] who was born in [[4070 BBY]]. The daughter of a prominent nobleman, Amanoa enjoyed the wealth and privileges afforded to the Onderonian aristocracy, and eventually married into the [[Onderon Royal Family|planet's royal family]] as the [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] of Onderon's [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]]. The couple birthed a daughter named [[Galia]], and together they lived in the [[Iziz Royal Palace|royal palace]] of Onderon's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]]. Amanoa's reign saw drastic changes in Onderon's role in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Along with her husband, she was beguiled by the [[Force ghost|specter]] of the long-dead [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Freedon Nadd]], to whom she became the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] in her final years. As she and Ommin steeped themselves further in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], both became [[Sith sorcerer|masters]] of [[Sith magic|Sith sorcery]], and used their magics to maintain rule over the Onderonian populace as dictated by four hundred years of tradition. When Ommin's health began to fail him as a result, Amanoa became the sovereign leader of Onderon, and imposed her will through the power of the dark side of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].\n\nAmanoa's allegiance to the spirit of Freedon Nadd brought her into direct conflict with the [[Beast Riders]] of Onderon's wilderness, [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] citizens who refused to submit to the oppression of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. Against the suggestions of Nadd, Amanoa entered into a protracted [[Beast Wars|war]] with the Beast Riders, and was eventually forced to request help from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] in hopes of bringing a peaceful resolution to conflict. However, it was through her petition that Amanoa's clandestine activities under Nadd's tutelage came to light. She was [[Battle of Iziz|defeated]] by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]] and his [[Padawan/Legends|apprentices]], and died when they drove the Dark Lord's influence from Iziz. When Amanoa's husband was killed in [[Second Battle of Onderon|battle]] with the same [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[3997 BBY|two years later]], the once-proud queen of Onderon was interred alongside him and their [[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Master]] in a [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|burial temple]] on Onderon's jungle [[Moon/Legends|moon]], [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nAmanoa was an Onderonian<ref>''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''</ref> and the daughter of a wealthy noble;<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" /> she was born in [[4070 BBY]].<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" /> When Ommin's father became one with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Ommin took his rightful place as the king of Onderon and ruler of Iziz. The new King married [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] Amanoa as his queen and together they had a daughter named Galia. As a direct descendant of Freedon Nadd, King Ommin rose to power like his ancestors by dominating the citizens of Onderon with the power of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]].<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nOmmin and his ancestors hid their dark secrets well, and so Amanoa knew nothing about her husband's allegiance with the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] for many years. One day, Ommin suddenly lost interest in mundane daily activities, as his training under Nadd's ghost had progressed considerably. Eventually Amanoa discovered the bond between her husband and the Sith. The queen tried to tear Ommin away from the dark teachings, a futile effort, for the blood of Nadd ran in Ommin's very body. Failing to help her husband, the frustrated Amanoa's depression turned into anger and outright hatred for the king. At that moment, King Ommin decided that his wife was ready to embrace the ways of the Sith and the teachings of darkness. The queen slowly fell to the dark side. Once Amanoa crossed the point of no return, she opened herself to the dark power. King Ommin and the spirit of Freedon Nadd taught Amanoa the ways of the Force and the techniques of the Sith, and together, the king and queen became powerful [[Sith sorcerer]]s.<ref name=\"The Dark Side Sourcebook\" />\n\n[[File:Amanoa_and_Galia.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Queen Amanoa and her daughter, Galia.]]\nThe love between Ommin and Amanoa faded during their quest for Sith knowledge. Mistrust, loathing, and outright hatred quickly filled the space where their love had once existed. Little did the pair know that Freedon Nadd was manipulating them both. The long-dead Dark Lord's ultimate goal was to physically resurrect himself. By teaching his descendants well, Nadd hoped to find a powerful candidate to study [[Sith alchemy/Legends|Sith alchemy]] and create a body to hold his spirit. To ensure that either Ommin or Amanoa would be powerful enough, Nadd manipulated them into competing with one another.<ref name=\"The Dark Side Sourcebook\" />\n\nSoon after, Ommin lost control of his own body&mdash;the price he paid for the power of the dark side. A [[Durasteel/Legends|durasteel]] exoskeleton was built by the king's personal doctors to support his flesh and blood. As Ommin retreated from public to further his study of the dark ways, Queen Amanoa assumed the daily duties as the ruler of Onderon.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nApart from ruling Iziz, Amanoa sought to expand the Onderonian Sith cult as well. In Onderon's history, only the royal family had been allowed to practice the Sith ways. King Ommin had taken [[Minister of State]] [[Novar (Human)|Novar]] as an apprentice two years previous, and had taught his initiate well. Amanoa continued the training of Novar and gave him King [[Adas]]'s [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocron]], which she had discovered less than a decade earlier, after she had learned all of its secrets. Amanoa commanded Novar to expand their Sith cult, telling him to instruct the new recruits in the basic principles and philosophies of the dark side. Those who proved themselves worthy of advancement would then receive further training from the holocron.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nAt the same time, Nadd realized that the couple had failed him: Ommin himself would never be strong enough to fulfill Nadd's dream, while Amanoa would not further her study once her husband failed to compete with her anymore. Indeed, Queen Amanoa spent all her time focusing on the administration of Onderon, abandoning her dark side studies, and handing the running of her cult over to Novar.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n===The arrival of the Jedi===\n{{Quote|But we were expecting a great Jedi Master&mdash;not untutored youths!|Queen Amanoa, to [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], [[Cay Qel-Droma]], and [[Tott Doneeta]]|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (miniseries)}}\n[[File:Amanoadarkness.jpg|thumb|250px|Queen Amanoa, giving herself completely to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]]]\nAmanoa learned from Nadd's example that one would be relatively powerless after death, and so she sought to expand the influence of Iziz to the rest of Onderon, concerned with temporal power while she still lived. The conflict between the rulers of Iziz and the [[Beast-Lord|Beast Lords]] of the wild had never ended. This long struggle, known as the Beast Wars, intensified during the iron-fisted rule of Queen Amanoa. One day during a Sith ritual, the spirit of her mentor Freedon Nadd foretold her demise: if Amanoa allowed the war to fully erupt, she would be destroyed. In a desperate measure of survival, Queen Amanoa called upon the help of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] to settle the three-centuries-old conflict once and for all.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nAmanoa never knew that Nadd's prophecy was not a Force vision, but merely a deception of the Dark Lord. Freedon Nadd hoped to con Amanoa back into studying the Sith ways instead of ruling Iziz, but the queen completely misunderstood him.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nReceiving the reply that the experienced Jedi Master Arca Jeth was assigned as the Jedi watchman of Onderon, Amanoa tried her very best to hide the presence of the dark side on the planet. However, just before the Jedi entered her palace, Queen Amanoa called upon the dark side to execute a prisoner named [[Olis]]. She had mixed feelings when the arriving Jedi were revealed to be the [[Padawan/Legends|apprentices]] of Arca instead of the Master himself. It would be much easier to hide the dark side from those young Jedi, but the youths might not be experienced enough to settle the conflict, which threatened her survival (according to Nadd's prophecy).<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nDuring the negotiation, the Beast Riders breached the [[Iziz defense tower|heavy defenses]] of Iziz and [[Raid on the Iziz Royal Palace|stormed the citadel]]. Convinced that such a breach could succeed only with the help of traitors, Amanoa requested the Jedi help in the defense of Iziz. During the battle in the citadel, Beast Warrior commandos slipped past the Jedi and kidnapped Princess Galia. Queen Amanoa attempted to call upon the dark side, but was not fast enough to prevent the retreat of the commandos&mdash;therefore, Amanoa demanded that the Jedi rescue the princess.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n===The Battle of Onderon===\n{{Quote|I call upon the spirit of Freedon Nadd, a Jedi far greater than these impotent youths. May the dark power that he taught me and my husband and all our ancestors fill me now!|Queen Amanoa, to the Jedi and the Kiras|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (miniseries)}}\n[[File:Amanoadeath.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Amanoa, experiencing the effects of Master Arca's light side attack]]\n\nThe next reports Amanoa received were of massing Beast armies and the [[Binding Ceremony|unification]] [[Binding Ceremony of Oron Kira and Galia|between]] her daughter and the Beast Lord [[Oron Kira]]. As the young couple and the Jedi came back to negotiate peace with Amanoa, the enraged queen called upon the dark side and the teachings of Nadd to crush her enemies. The citadel was surrounded by physical darkness, instilling fear in those present. Catching news that the negotiations had failed, Oron's father [[Modon Kira|Modon]] launched an attack on Iziz, known as the [[Battle of Iziz|Battle of Onderon]]. In the confusion of the citadel, Cay Qel-Droma came face-to-face with Amanoa and ordered that the queen cease using her dark power. However, Cay's sword-hand was shot by Amanoa's [[Royal Protector|guardsman]], and the young Jedi eventually lost his left arm completely.<ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\" /> Outside, as the battle raged against the very wall of the citadel, Amanoa retreated to the mausoleum of Freedon Nadd in order to deploy her ultimate weapon. Knowing that Iziz's military strength would not decide the outcome of the battle, Amanoa called upon the dark side against the Beast warriors in the name of Ommin and Nadd. For the first time in her life, Amanoa gave herself completely to the dark side. Achieving an effect similar to that of [[battle meditation]], Amanoa's dark power sapped the will of the Beast armies. The attack of the Beast Lords began to lose momentum; the war beasts no longer listened to their riders, and the soldiers became sick and confused. It appeared that Queen Amanoa had successfully turned the tide of the battle.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nHowever, victory was not destined for Amanoa. Jedi Master Arca Jeth arrived at that key moment and, sensing the dark energies being used against the Beast Riders, applied his own Jedi battle meditation to turn the tide once more&mdash;after more than three centuries of conflict, the Beast Wars were finally over.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n===Death and legacy===\n{{Quote|No! Nooo! The light&hellip; the light! Nooooo!!|Queen Amanoa's last words|audio=AmanoaDeath-TOTJ.ogg|Tales of the Jedi (audio)}}\n[[File:Amanoa_funeral.jpg|thumb|175px|The funeral procession for Queen Amanoa]]\n\nReunited after the battle, Master Arca led his apprentices and Princess Galia to the deepest sub-levels of the palace: the tomb of Freedon Nadd. As Galia rushed to her mother, Freedon Nadd withdrew his dark power and support from Amanoa as he sensed the approaching [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]] of Arca Jeth. Without the support of Nadd's power, Queen Amanoa of Onderon died in the arms of her daughter.<ref name=\"The Dark Side Sourcebook\" />\n\nAfter her death, Amanoa's husband Ommin ordered his [[Naddist|subordinates]] to launch a series of attacks throughout Iziz. Sensing the presence of the dark side haunting the planet, Master Arca determined to move the sarcophagi of Amanoa and Freedon Nadd to the moon Dxun. An armored dark side warrior named [[Warb Null]] led a task force to ambush the Jedi at the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] with a [[groundborer]], and the Naddists successfully brought the sarcophagi to Ommin's stronghold.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 1]]</ref>\n\nAfter the Jedi settled the [[Freedon Nadd Uprising|Naddist revolt]], Amanoa's sarcophagus, together with Nadd's, was moved to Dxun and interred in a protected tomb. Despite frequent intruders who sought Nadd's legacy, Amanoa rested in her sarcophagus peacefully and was never disturbed again.<ref>[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 2]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Ulic Qel-Droma&mdash;is ''this'' my reward for asking you to help our beleaguered city&mdash;the loss of my daughter?! I demand, in the name of the Republic, that you seek out the kidnappers and bring her back!|Queen Amanoa|audio=RaidOnIzizRoyalPalace4-TOTJ.ogg|Tales of the Jedi (audio)}}\nBefore her fall to the dark side, Amanoa was consumed with na\u00efvete, delaying the discovery&mdash;and acceptance&mdash;of her husband's dark alliance with Nadd for many years. This refusal to see things as they were then drove the queen to attempt to end Ommin's studies, an exercise in futility. Her awakening came when she realized that the king could not be redeemed, and Amanoa gave in to depression, fear, and anger: her transformation into a minion of the dark side had already begun.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n\nAs she and Ommin trained under the specter of Freedon Nadd, Amanoa possessed a spirit of competition. Her loathing and distrust of her husband drove the queen to develop her abilities to incredible heights, if only to best him. When King Ommin became ill and removed himself from public life, Amanoa's studies began to stagnate as she became content to simply rule Iziz with an iron fist.<ref name=\"The Dark Side Sourcebook\" />\n\nOne of the most constant motivations in Amanoa's life was love. Love for her husband drove the queen to support him in his dark apprenticeship. However, ultimately the dark side saw to it that their love could only serve its purposes and not theirs, as it drove them apart, fostering fear and hatred between them.<ref name=\"The Dark Side Sourcebook\" /> Love for her daughter Galia caused the queen to request the Jedi's support in her rescue. In the end, Amanoa died in the arms of Galia, having embraced the dark side and the Sith teachings because of her belief that it was the only way for her to protect her daughter and assure the power their family enjoyed.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Amanoa first appeared in the sub-series [[Tales of the Jedi 1|''Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon, Part 1'']] of the [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']].<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Writer [[Tom Veitch]] created her for this sub-series, and he used her dark side legacy in the second sub-series [[Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising|''The Freedon Nadd Uprising'']], which Veitch also wrote.<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1\" /> Although Amanoa is stated to be 70 years old during ''Tales of the Jedi 1'', which would place her birth date at 4070 BBY,<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" /> the article [[The Horse's Mouth|''Straight from the Horse's Mouth'']] in [[Star Wars Insider 26|''Star Wars Insider'' 26]] asserts that Amanoa was born in 4068 BBY. As ''Straight from the Horse's Mouth'' contradicts a number of other established dates,<ref name=\"insider26\">{{InsiderCite|26|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 1}}</ref> for the purpose of this article the original comic is treated as correct.\n\nThere has been some confusion about whether or not Amanoa is a proclaimed user of the Force technique [[battle meditation]]. According to the comic sub-series ''Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon'', Amanoa does not use battle meditation. However, according to the [[Tales of the Jedi (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi'' audio book]], Amanoa uses a series of Force abilities which are very similar to battle meditation; though, in this point in the audio book, it is only ever established that Arca Jeth is a user of this Force technique.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Amanoa}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi (audio)]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Freedon Nadd Uprising]]'' {{C|Sarcophagus}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi'' audio book]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 1]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 3|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 3]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{C|Mentioned in Codex entry}}\n*''[[Bane of the Sith]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|26|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 1}}\n*{{InsiderCite|27|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 2}}\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[The Dark Side Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*{{FFCite|113|REV1, ''Naddist Revolt''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galaxy at War]]''\n*{{DB|character|queenamanoa|Amanoa, Queen|archivedate=20100330020318}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=Queen of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] with King [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]]<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi Companion\" />\n|years=&mdash;[[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]]<ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\" />\n|before=[[Ommin's father]] with unknown queen (eventually [[Freedon Nadd]])<ref name=\"Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n|before-years=&mdash;[[4018 BBY]]<ref name=\"The Dark Side Sourcebook\" />\n|after=King [[Oron Kira]] and Queen [[Galia]]<ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\" />\n|after-years=[[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]]&mdash;<ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\" />\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Amanoa#legends\n|es=Amanoa\n|fr=Amanoa\n|pl=Amanoa\n|ru=\u0410\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0430\n|esFA=1\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Monarchs of Onderon]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Sith acolytes and apprentices]]\n[[Category:Sith Masters]]\n[[Category:Sith sorcerers]]"}}}]}}}}
