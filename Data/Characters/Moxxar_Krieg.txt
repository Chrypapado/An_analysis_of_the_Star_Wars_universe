After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Krieg and [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Edvar Vang]] discovered the existence of a new kind of [[Syren spice|spice]].<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" /> This spice was trafficked by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] but was also sought by the powerful criminal organization [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]].<ref name=\"SWG:MtYBF\">{{SWGcite|exp=JtL|type=other}}Quest: \"More than You Bargained For\"</ref> While Vang considered that the situation had become too dangerous, Krieg continued to look into the source of the spice. He was then detected and threatened to stop his investigation. However, Moxxar Krieg refused to do so and was finally assassinated in his [[Moxxar Krieg's house|house]] in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]].<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\" /> a group of spacers discovered a sample of the new spice while looking for a missing pilot, [[Cal Handro]]. They brought it to Doctor Vang but the latter exhorted them to interrogate Krieg instead of him. The spacers only found the corpse of Moxxar Krieg in his house.<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:MaxxarKrieg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Moxxar Krieg in ''Star Wars Galaxies''.]]\nMoxxar Krieg appeared in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:MD\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Moxxar Krieg was added to the game with the first chapter of the \"[[W:c:swg:Secrets of the Syren|Secrets of the Syren]]\" questline, released with the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 14 Notes for 9 March 05|Publish 14]]\", on [[March 9]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/board/message?board.id=swgpatchnotes&message.id=730|text=Update Notes: Publish 14.0 - March 9, 2005|archivedate=20051113081026}}</ref> The \"Secrets of the Syren\" story arc was removed from the game with the \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]], due to the major changes planed for Rori with the introduction of the [[Battle of Restuss]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Jump to Lightspeed}} {{1st}} {{Corpse}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Man_Down_(card).JPG|cardname=Man Down}} {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Secrets of the Syren}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Krieg, Moxxar}}\n[[Category:Humanoids]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
