He was killed by the future [[Hunter (individual)|Grand Champion of the Great Hunt]] on [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nTrying to get his competitor killed, [[Tarro Blood]] convinced Vorr and his sister, Vye, that the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] who killed Vexx shot him in the back and then murdered [[Braden]]. Along with Vye, Vorr confronted the hunter in the [[Sobrik]] [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]]. In the ensuing firefight, the hunter proved better with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and killed the siblings.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVorr first appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' released by [[BioWare]] in [[2011]]. He appears on the planet Balmorra just after the bounty hunter lands. The player also has the \"[[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]]\" option of convincing Vorr of Tarro's deception, where he leaves the hunter alone. This article assumes the player chose the first \"dark side\" option.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0412\u043e\u0440\u0440 (\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
