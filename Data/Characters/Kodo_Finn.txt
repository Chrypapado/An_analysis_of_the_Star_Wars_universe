Kodo offered [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] but the leader of the gang, a [[Duros/Legends|Duros]], still expressed a desire to cause harm to the two Omwati as a message to Kodo from Xizor for he and his wife to keep silent. [[Ekria]], [[Zonder]] and [[Drake Lo'gaan]] came to their rescue, however not before the Duros was able to hit Kodo once. The punch resulted in fourth-stage burns in the shape of the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] symbol. Kodo was branded.\n\nLater, while hospitalized due to his burns, Kodo's wife was on a [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] report, giving an account of what happened at the skirmish. This report was seen by Imperial [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]] [[Antinnis Tremayne]], as well as [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] Xizor. When fugitive [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] Drake, Zonder, and Erkria discovered the danger the Omwati and his wife were still in, they found them at their residence to warn them. Unfortunately the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]] had already arrived, forcing Erkria, Zonder, Kodo, and Aleema to retreat while Drake held him off. After a brief scuffle with Imperial agents, Drake managed to escape and meet up with Kodo to get an explanation.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Evasive Action: Prey]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Kodo Finn\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Finn, Kodo}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Omwati]]"}}}]}}}}
