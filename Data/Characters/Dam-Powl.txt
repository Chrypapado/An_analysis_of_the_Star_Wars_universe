When [[Je'daii Journeyer]] [[Lanoree Brock]] arrived at the Temple, Dam-Powl began teaching Brock the skills required to master the [[Alchemy of flesh]], a dangerous skill set that were test Brock's ability to remain balanced in the Force. Her most prized student, Dam-Powl and Brock retained a strong relationship in the years that followed Brock's departure from the academy. At some point during her time at Anil Kesh, Dam-Powl genetically altered the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Tre Sana]] in exchange for promises of a wealth, a new identity, and a better life outside of the criminal empire he was a part of on [[Kalimahr]]. Serving as her informant and spy for a time, Dam-Powl made use of Sana during the [[Stargazer Uprising]], tasking him with assisting Je'daii Brock on her hunt for her rogue brother, [[Dalien Brock]].
