Harand believed that these religious days were a cultural memory of the [[The Devouring|genocidal campaign]] waged by the [[Hutt Empire]] against the Tionese after Xim the Despot's defeat at the [[Third Battle of Vontor]] in [[25,100 BBY]].<ref name=\"Xim Week\" />\n\nTo prove his theory, Harand sent his students, including the young [[Henrietya Antilles]], on expeditions into the [[Ash Worlds/Legends|Ash Worlds]], a largely barren, unsettled stretch of space trailing of the [[Tion Cluster/Legends|Tion Cluster]]. They discovered that [[Radiation/Legends|radiation]] levels on many of the uninhabited planets there fit the profile of [[fission bomb]] attacks some twenty-five thousand years previously. Since the ancient [[Hutt Empire]] was known for such genocides and atrocities, historians had until then considered the Ash Worlds an abandoned [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] domain. Harand, however, suggested that the Ash Worlds were in fact the remnants of the lost Kiirium Reaches attested to in Xim-era chronicles.<ref name=\"Xim Week\" />\n\nFor millennia the true location of the Kiirium Reaches, as well as the identities of [[Wyndigal 2|Huronom]] and [[OHS3842-03|Astigone]], the Seventh and Eighth Thrones of Xim, had been debated. The [[Salin Corridor/Legends|Salin Corridor]] had been suggested as a possible location, with [[Columex/Legends|Columex]] and [[Trogan/Legends|Trogan]] often being identified as Huronom and many luxury resorts on [[Centares/Legends|Centares]] carrying the name Astigone. Further afield, [[Jabiim/Legends|Jabiim]], [[Lucazec/Legends|Lucazec]], and even [[Lantillies/Legends|Lantillies]] had been proposed as the \"Lost Thrones\". While the newborn [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] interdiction of the Ash Worlds for weapons testing made further expeditions impossible, Harand and his students searched for proof in the records of the [[Tion Cluster/Legends|Tion Cluster]]. Henrietya Antilles' discovery of the [[Great Duinarbulon Mausoleum]] and translation of the tomes within proved Harand correct: the [[Antilles Map]] found in the Mausoleum showed that the planet [[Wyndigal 2]] was once Huronom, while [[OHS3842-03]] had been Astigone. Subsequent discoveries in the archives of [[Duinarbulon]] and on [[Dellalt/Legends|Dellalt]] confirmed that the Hutts had destroyed the Kiirium Reaches around [[24,000 BBY]], to gain a buffer zone between [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]] and the young Galactic Republic pushing into the Tion Cluster. Harand's theories on the Devouring were largely accepted by [[40 ABY]].<ref name=\"Xim Week\" />\n\nHarand additionally wrote a travelogue entitled ''[[Travels Amid Strange Stars]]'', detailing his journey around the Tion Cluster in search of an accurate, contemporary artistic depiction of Xim the Despot. His journey took him from Dellalt to [[Barancar]] to [[Soruus (planet)|Soruus]], where he dismissed the various statues of Xim as forgeries or inaccurate while dealing with unhelpful guides. On [[Dravione]], he was unsuccessful in locating the remainder of a ruined statue of Xim, which was destroyed above the knees. He remained unsuccessful on Duinarbulon, [[Nuswatta]] and [[Desevro/Legends|Desevro]]. Finally, on Xim's homeworld of [[Argai]], largely unchanged since the Despot's day, he concluded that the native Argaians would likewise be little changed in appearance from Xim. After his [[Groundcar/Legends|groundcar]] broke down outside a cemetery near [[Sah Gosta]] on Argai, Harand noticed a disinterred [[Bone/Legends|skull]], remarking that this symbol of death, and the symbol of [[Xim's empire]], was as good a depiction of the Despot as any he would find.<ref name=\"Author's Cut\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nHarand was known for having a quick tongue and was renowned for his descriptive records of various civilizations. He had a rather grandiloquent writing style that was somewhat condescending to the people of the Tion Cluster: he regarded most of his tour guides as sullen or swindlers, and considered the Argaians \"squat and unlovely\", unchanged since the days of Xim.<ref name=\"Author's Cut\" />\n\nRather romantic, Harand reflected on the inevitability of [[Death/Legends|death]] in ''Travels Amid Strange Stars'', connecting it to the death's head symbol of Xim's empire. In that moment, he felt connected to the long-dead Despot.<ref name=\"Author's Cut\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/essential-atlas-extra-the-history-of-xim-and-the-tion-cluster|text=''Essential Atlas'' Extra: The History of Xim and the Tion Cluster|int=Xim Week: The History of Xim and the Tion Cluster}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-essential-guide-to-warfare-authors-cut-part-3-xim-the-despot|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'' Author's Cut, Part 3 &ndash; \"Xim the Despot\"|int=Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut}}\n*[[Star Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook|''Star Wars: Force and Destiny'' Core Rulebook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bleys Harand\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harand, Bleys}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Historians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Philosophers]]"}}}]}}}}
