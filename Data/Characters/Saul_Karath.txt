It makes you do things you never thought you'd do.|Saul Karath|Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide}}\n'''Saul Karath''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] who served in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] [[Republic Navy|Navy]] as an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] during the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. In [[3963 BBY]], Karath was promoted to the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Rear Admiral/Legends|Rear Admiral]] after keeping the [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Mandalorian forces]] at bay for six [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] at the [[Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line]]. When the fugitive [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Zayne Carrick]]&mdash;who was fleeing from his [[Jedi Master/Legends|Masters]] after being framed for the [[Padawan Massacre]]&mdash;attempted to warn Karath of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Serroco]]'s impending [[Battle of Serroco|destruction]], Karath assumed that Carrick was a [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Spy/Legends|spy]]. When the Mandalorians razed Serroco's surface, Karath and his allies took Carrick into custody and, after boarding [[The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania|Adascorp]] leader [[Arkoh Adasca]]'s [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] ''[[Arkanian Legacy]]'', they participated in an [[First Battle of Omonoth|auction]] in which Karath attempted to negotiate for Republic control of Adasca's [[Exogorth/Legends|exogorth]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapons]]. After Adasca's schemes were brought to an end, Karath also played a role in the events of the [[Vindication|Covenant Affair]], which saw the destruction of the [[Jedi Covenant]]&mdash;a secret Jedi organization which was dedicated to preventing the rise of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]&mdash;when one of the leaders, the [[Sith Acolyte]] [[Haazen]], led an insurrection against the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].\n\nIn that same [[Standard year/Legends|year]], the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], [[Darth Malak|Malak]] and their [[Revanchist|Jedi faction]] entered the war, with Karath becoming Revan's and Malak's subordinate. Karath later assisted Carrick in [[Incident near Ithor system|destroying]] the [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] organization known as [[the Crucible]]. In [[3960 BBY]], after Revan and Malak led the Republic to victory against the Mandalorians in the war's [[Battle of Malachor V|final battle]], Karath was one of the few individuals among the Republic forces who did not follow the Jedi into the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] to search for the ancient [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Star Forge]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]], which produced an unlimited amount of war mat\u00e9riel. [[3959 BBY|A year later]], Revan returned to the Republic as the new [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], with Malak as his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]], igniting the [[Jedi Civil War]]. In [[3958 BBY]], Karath transferred his allegiance to [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Revan's [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]], bringing his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Leviathan (Interdictor-class cruiser)|''Leviathan'']], to Revan's service. In order to test Karath's loyalty, Malak ordered the Admiral to [[Bombing of Telos IV|destroy]] the planet [[Telos IV]]. Karath [[Death/Legends|killed]] millions of civilians on Telos, and earned the wrath of his former friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Carth Onasi]], who had served with Karath during the Mandalorian Wars. After Malak betrayed Revan during the Jedi's and Republic's attempt to [[Capture of Darth Revan|capture]] them, Karath continued to serve the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] forces under Malak's command.\n\nIn the war's [[3956 BBY|final year]], Malak [[Capture of Taris|captured]] the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] and ordered the Sith [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] to [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]] the planet so that the Sith forces could search for Jedi Knight [[Bastila Shan]]. Karath was eventually ordered by the Dark [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lord]] to [[Destruction of Taris|destroy]] the planet in order to prevent Shan's escape, and Karath [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombarded]] Taris. Shortly after Taris's destruction, Malak and Karath were informed by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Calo Nord]] of Shan's [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|escape]] from the planet, and of Revan's survival and involvement in the escape. Malak and Karath hired Nord to capture Shan, but Revan, now a partially [[Jedi training/Legends|re-trained]] Jedi, [[Ambush on Tatooine (Jedi Civil War)|killed]] Nord during his search for the Star Forge. After Revan located a fourth Rakatan [[Star Map]]&mdash;which was needed to find the Star Forge&mdash;and [[Duel in Hrakert Station|slew]] Malak's [[Shadow Hand]] [[Darth Bandon]], Karath captured Revan's [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' and [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] Revan, Onasi, and Shan in an attempt to discern their mission. The two Jedi and Onasi eventually escaped and confronted Karath on the ''Leviathan''{{'s}} [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]]. Karath offered to ask Malak to be merciful if the Jedi and Onasi surrendered; however, Shan, Revan, and Onasi refused. Karath and his forces [[Skirmish aboard the Leviathan|attacked]] them, and after a heated [[Lightfight|firefight]], Karath was grievously injured. As he lay dying, Karath informed Onasi about Revan's true identity as the former Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] of the Sith, and then succumbed to the wounds dealt to him by Onasi and the Jedi.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\n{{Quote|Long before he made my life miserable, ''Saul Karath'' made his name hunting pirates in ''Reciprocity''.|Zayne Carrick, regarding Karath|Knights of the Old Republic: War 4}}\n[[File:Karath_captures_Ying.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Saul Karath assists a Twi'lek Jedi in the arrest of bounty hunter Valius Ying.]]\nSaul Karath, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]],<ref name=\"databank\" /> was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] to journeyman laborer [[Craddock Karath]].

Karath was too young to serve in the navy officially and, because of his tough upbringing, the young [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] did not possess the connections to enter the [[Naval Academy]]. Nevertheless, Karath won the attention of [[Fleet Captain/Legends|Fleet Captain]] [[Orley Vanicus]], who allowed Karath to serve as a non-commissioned [[Captain/Legends|captain's]] steward on his [[Starship/Legends|ship]] ''[[Reliance I]]''.<ref name=\"Handbook\" />\n\nFor every success Karath gained, a setback followed. However, due to the fact that he considered the navy his family, the young man never lost faith in the institution. Eventually, Karath was promoted to the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of captain and given his first command aboard the [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] ''[[Reciprocity]]''. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], Karath was successful in defending [[Convoy/Legends|convoys]] against [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]],<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> and at some point before the [[Mandalorian Wars]], Karath and his [[Executive officer/Legends|first officer]] [[Dallan Morvis]] assisted a [[Unidentified Twi'lek Jedi (Valius Ying)|Twi'lek Jedi]] in capturing the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Valius Ying]].<ref name=\"KotOR: War 4\">[[Knights of the Old Republic: War 4|''Knights of the Old Republic: War'' 4]]</ref><ref name=\"JJM's notes for KotOR: War 4\">{{Faraway|comics/swkotorwar/swkotorwar4.html|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic &ndash; War #4''|archivedate=20170922095445}}</ref> At one point, when the ''Reciprocity'' was in an engagement with enemies, Karath recognized the Republic [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Carth Onasi]]'s skills.

From his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] ''Courageous'', Karath managed to halt the Mandalorians' progress at the system of [[Suurja]] through [[First battle of Suurja|four]] [[Second battle of Suurja|large]]-[[Third battle of Suurja|scale]] [[Fourth battle of Suurja|battles]], thus keeping the [[Jebble-Vanquo-Tarnith line]], a boundary between the Republic and Neo-Crusader forces, intact.<ref name=\"Taris Holofeed\">{{KOTORbackups|0}}</ref> Not long after, Karath was sent to defend the trading post of [[Vanquo]] from the invading Mandalorian fleet. As he had predicted, the [[Battle of Vanquo|attack]] on Vanquo was only part of [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore's]] plan for invading the Republic; while Karath's forces were busy at Vanquo, the Mandalorians [[Taris Siege|assaulted]] the remainder of the Republic fleet at Taris. Karath saw this development as a positive, as he was certain that when an important world like Taris was threatened, the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Republic Senate]] would put more [[Troop/Legends|troops]] into the conflict.<ref name=\"KotOR 8\" />\n\nDuring the Battle of Vanquo, Karath was informed by [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] Dallan Morvis that a junk [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] was fleeing the battle. The ship, called [[The Last Resort (starship)|''The Last Resort'']], was assisting the fugitive [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Zayne Carrick]],<ref name=\"KotOR 8\" /> who was on the run from his [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] after being framed for carrying out the [[Padawan Massacre]].<ref name=\"KotOR 2\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 2|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 2]]</ref> ''The Last Resort'' was entering [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] into Mandalorian territories, and when Morvis informed Karath that it was Carrick's ship, the captain immediately suspected that Carrick was a Mandalorian [[Spy/Legends|spy]].

As Carrick and Onasi arrived on the ''Courageous''{{'s}} [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]], Karath congratulated the lieutenant and accused Carrick of being a Mandalorian spy. Karath interrogated Carrick, who denied knowing Mandalore and the accusations of being a spy, and asked Karath to allow Onasi to try to get in contact with the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Darth Malak|Alek]], known to Carrick as \"Squint\".<ref name=\"KotOR 15\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 15|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 15]]</ref>\n\nKarath instructed Onasi to go to the command center and contact the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] so they could locate \"Squint\". At that point, the Mandalorian ships dropped out of hyperspace and launched [[Nuclear bomb|nuclear missiles]] toward the Republic fleet. Karath attempted to counter the attack, but instead of heading toward the fleet, the [[Missile/Legends|missiles]] continued towards Serroco's surface. The missiles destroyed the planet's [[Stereb]] [[Stereb cities|cities]] and inflicted heavy damage to its Human settlements. As Carrick wept over the planet's destruction on the ''Courageous''{{'s}} bridge, Karath decided that it was time to rethink their strategies against the Mandalorians. Karath promised Carrick that he would hand him over to the Jedi, and had the Padawan sealed in a [[Prison/Legends|cell]].<ref name=\"KotOR 15\" />\n\nWhen Mandalorian [[Neo-Crusader Shock Trooper|shock troopers]] boarded the ''Courageous'', Karath was forced to abandon ship with Lieutenant Onasi and [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] Morvis. Karath reluctantly agreed to take Carrick along with them as they fled to Onasi's ship ''[[Deadweight]]''. After escaping the ''Courageous''<ref name=\"KotOR 17\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 17|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 17]]</ref>&mdash;which was destroyed by the Mandalorians<ref name=\"KotOR 20\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 20|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 20]]</ref>&mdash;Karath filed a report with the [[Admiral of the Fleet/Legends|Admiral of the Fleet]], in which he raised concerns with the disposition of his forces, which were under pursuit on the [[hyperlane]]s from Serroco to the [[Galactic economy|banking]] world [[Telerath/Legends|Telerath]]. Karath further expressed his hope to make it to [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]] or the [[Ryyk Nebula]], where he could meet with the [[Tremendous battle group|''Tremendous'']] fleet.<ref name=\"Remember Serroco\">{{KOTORbackups|16}}</ref>\n\n====The Adasca Affair====\n{{Quote|I'm telling you, Admiral, We've got more than enough grounds to arrest Lord Adasca and turn him over to the Republic!''\"<br />\"''You want us to ''arrest Adasca''?

When the ''Deadweight'' was in transit to Arkania, Karath received a transmission from [[Eejee Vamm]]&mdash;a servant of the medical corporation [[The Adasca BioMechanical Corporation of Arkania|Adascorp]], which was headed by [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Arkoh Adasca]]&mdash;requesting Karath's presence at a meeting aboard Adasca's flagship ''[[Arkanian Legacy]]''. After being informed about [[Exogorth/Legends|exogorth]] creatures&mdash;large gastropods which were capable of surviving in the [[Vacuum/Legends|vacuum]] of [[Realspace/Legends|space]]&mdash;which Adasca's [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]] modified to be [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapons]], Karath ordered Onasi to redirect the ship to the ''Legacy''.<ref name=\"KotOR 18\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 18|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 18]]</ref> When Karath disembarked from the ''Deadweight'', Adasca greeted him and asked Karath if he was able to negotiate on the Republic's behalf. In the meanwhile, Karath had Carrick moved to the ship's detention area. Later in the observation dome, Karath listened to Adasca explain how the exogorths could be operated as weapons capable of destroying entire [[Star/Legends|star]] systems. After Adasca finished, Karath asked Adasca what exactly he wanted from the Republic; when the Mandalorians led by Mandalore the Ultimate arrived at the meeting, Adasca declared that his corporation was now a [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] player, and that they sought allies, not contracts.<ref name=\"KotOR 19\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 19|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 19]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Karathmeetmandalore.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Karath tells Mandalore the Ultimate to step away from Jedi Knight Alek.]]\nAfter Mandalore boarded the ''Legacy'', Karath defended the Jedi Knight Alek&mdash;who was representing the [[Revanchist]] Jedi faction<ref name=\"KotOR 20\" /> which believed the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] should take an active stance against the Mandalorians<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" />&mdash;by pulling his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and threatening Mandalore after the Jedi was disabled by the Mandalorian leader's [[Mandalore the Ultimate's battle-axe|newly-made battle axe]] as a result of an attempted attack on the Jedi's part. Later, Karath was implored by Alek to arrest Adasca, but Karath refused, citing their outnumbered position. After Adasca commenced with a test of the exogorths, Karath granted Onasi permission to return to the ''Deadweight'' after the lieutenant became disgusted at what he saw. Soon, Karath argued that the Jedi and Republic were one and the same after Mandalore expressed his wish to keep the exogorths out of either organization's control, and further asked Mandalore why he did not just forcibly take the exogorths. When Mandalore offered to make Adasca weaponsmith of all the Mandalorian clans,<ref name=\"KotOR 20\" /> Karath began to grow desperate, and asked Adasca if he wanted his own territory.<ref name=\"KotOR 21\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 21|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 21]]</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Zayne Carrick and his former Jedi Master Lucien Draay<ref name=\"KotOR 21\" />&mdash;who was aboard the ''Legacy'' in order to investigate Adasca<ref name=\"KotOR 18\" />&mdash;met up with Onasi and rogue Mandalorian [[Demagol|Rohlan Dyre]] and worked together to put an end to Adasca's scheme. Both Carrick, who was in a suit of [[Neo-Crusader armor|armor]] that Mandalore had given Dyre earlier, and Onasi went to the observation dome and started a diversion&mdash;which involved leading the Mandalorians into believing that Adasca, the [[Republic officer/Legends|Republic officers]], and Jedi at the meeting had set a trap for them. The diversion worked, and Karath&mdash;along with Carrick, Draay, Alek, Onasi, Dyre, Morvis, and Carrick's companion [[Jarael]]&mdash;participated in the [[First Battle of Omonoth|ensuing battle]]. Karath was injured during the skirmish, and was escorted by Morvis back to the ''Deadweight''. Karath, Onasi, and Morvis successfully escaped the ''Legacy''{{'s}} observation dome as the exogorths devoured it, killing Adasca.<ref name=\"KotOR 21\" /> After Karath, Morvis, and Onasi reached the [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Karath filed his resignation to the Admiral of the Fleet because of the losses of Battle Group Serroco and the ''Courageous''. However, the Admiral of the Fleet refused to recognize Karath's resignation, and met with Karath, Onasi, and Morvis. After this, the Admiral of the Fleet publicly commended Karath. While the Admiralty did not assign him a posting, Karath appreciated the public's support, and expressed his desire for those in his position to have a chance to see their families. Karath also confirmed that Arkoh Adasca was dead, although he declined to speak publicly of the events that transpired.<ref name=\"Karath Home Safely\">{{KOTORbackups|22}}</ref>\n\n====The Covenant Affair====\n{{Quote|Has everybody gone insane?

Draay deceived the Admiral into believing that Carrick would attack the planet aboard the starship ''[[Moomo Williwaw]]''; Karath was instructed by Draay to ensure that he eliminated Carrick as a threat. Karath was teamed up with the [[Khil]] Jedi Master [[Xamar]];<ref name=\"KotOR 30\" /> the Admiral later assured Xamar that nobody would get through to Coruscant without going through the planetary defense. At that moment, Karath ordered the initiation of the [[Vanjervalis Chain]], a [[Sensor/Legends|sensor]] package that not only predicted enemy movements and adjusted strategies, but linked multiple Republic [[Cruiser/Legends|cruisers]] under a single command.<ref name=\"KotOR 31\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 31|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 31]]</ref>\n\nAs the ''Moomo Williwaw'' approached Coruscant, Karath suggested that Xamar join the other Republic [[Starfighter/Legends|fighters']] efforts in the [[Space warfare|space battle]], assuring the Khil that his forces would not accidentally shoot the Jedi. Sometime after Xamar left the ''Swiftsure''{{'s}} bridge, the ''Moomo Williwaw'' crashed in the ship's docking bay. Karath and his forces managed to get the bay doors open; when Carrick's companion Jarael disembarked their ship, Karath detained the [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] [[Arkanian Offshoot/Legends|offshoot]] and ordered his forces to search for Carrick and his [[Snivvian/Legends|Snivvian]] companion [[Marn Hierogryph]]. When they could not find them, Karath began to ask Xamar to find the two fugitives, but he found that the Jedi<ref name=\"KotOR 31\" />&mdash;who had stowed away on Onasi's ship ''Deadweight'' along with Carrick and Hierogryph and escaped to Coruscant's surface<ref name=\"KotOR 32\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 32|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 32]]</ref>&mdash;was not there.<ref name=\"KotOR 31\" />\n\nEventually, the Vanjervalis Chain's tactical system was taken over by [[Sith Acolyte]] [[Haazen]]&mdash;who, while serving the Covenant, had directed the [[Draay Trust]] to buy [[Vanjervalis Systems]], which allowed him to hack and directly control the chain.

Shan was being pursued by Malak because of her power with [[Battle meditation]], a [[Force power/Legends|Force power]] that enabled her to strengthen the Republic forces' resolve and coordinate their fighting effort while sapping the will of their enemies. Shan managed to escape to the Tarisian surface aboard an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]]. After Malak's forces [[Capture of Taris|captured]] Taris, Karath was in command of the [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]] over the planet while the Sith forces searched the surface for Shan. Karath was eventually ordered by the Dark Lord to [[Destruction of Taris|destroy]] Taris in order to prevent Shan's [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|escape]]. At first, Karath was hesitant with the idea of murdering the billions of people on Taris, including the [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith troopers]] still on the surface. However, Malak reminded Karath of the fate of his [[Saul Karath's predecessor|predecessor]], and after Karath positioned the fleet, he began the bombardment.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n{{K1order}}\nShortly after Taris' destruction, Karath introduced Malak to the [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] [[Hunting/Legends|hunter]] [[Calo Nord]] aboard the ''Leviathan''. Malak was informed by Nord, who managed to survive the Sith bombardment, that Shan had successfully escaped Taris. Nord was, however, unaware that it was Revan, Malak's former Master, who assisted in Shan's escape. Malak hired Nord to track down Shan and capture her alive. However, Nord was [[Ambush on Tatooine (Jedi Civil War)|killed]] on the desert world [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] by Revan&mdash;who was now a [[Jedi training/Legends|retrained]] Jedi Padawan searching for the Star Forge. Karath received news of Nord's failure and informed Malak, asking the Dark Lord to forgive him. Karath's life was spared by Malak, who believed that Nord was solely responsible for failing to capture Shan. When the Admiral asked Malak about hiring another bounty hunter, the Dark Lord determined that no bounty hunter could stand against a Jedi. In order to not to repeat this error, Malak sent<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> his [[Shadow Hand]]<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> [[Darth Bandon]] to capture Shan and kill Revan.

Karath had Revan, Shan, and Onasi placed in [[force cage]]s after they were brought into custody, and began interrogating them in order to determine what their mission was. Malak was far more interested in Shan and Revan, and after the latter swore he would not betray the Jedi, Karath realized that Revan was unaware of his former identity. The Admiral suspected that he would not succeed in the interrogation, but nonetheless began [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] the Jedi and Onasi, since Malak was in another [[Sector/Legends|sector]]. Knowing that Revan cared for Shan, Karath made her suffer each time the Jedi refused to answer his questions. Karath used this to test Revan's loyalty when he asked where the Jedi Enclave was, but Revan still gave no answer to the Admiral. Karath eventually revealed that the question was only a test, since Malak already knew its location and had destroyed the Enclave.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nAfter Karath left the Jedi and Onasi in their cells, he sent a message to Malak informing him that they were in the detention area.

Karath offered to ask Darth Malak, who was on his way to the ship, to be merciful when he arrived if the two Jedi and Onasi would surrender their weapons. After Onasi refused, Karath went on the attack, and Revan, Shan, and Onasi slew the Sith troopers and Dark Jedi [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]]. After Karath was mortally wounded by the Jedi and Onasi, he asked his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to come closer so that he could speak with him.
