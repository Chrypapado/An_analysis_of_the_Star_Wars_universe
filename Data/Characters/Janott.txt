When the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] was shipping supplies to their [[Mokivj droid factory|secret base]] on [[Mokivj]] through Batuu, they used the [[cantina]] as a transfer point for the cargo, unaware that Janott was in league with [[Thief|thieves]] and [[smuggler]]s who were siphoning the cargo for themselves. When [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] came to Batuu to find her former [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden]] [[Duja]], who had alerted the [[Galactic Republic]] to Separatist activity in the area, she stopped at Janott's cantina. While Janott served Amidala an [[Andoan White]], she explained to him that she was looking for a man named [[Kuseph Jovi]] to deliver a [[starship]] to him and wondered why Jovi had picked a spot like Batuu for the meeting. Janott responded that Batuu wasn't exactly [[New Codia]]. Then Amidala questioned Janott about Duja, who had been laid on a funeral pyre outside the cantina, and offered to write a farewell song to the deceased. After the song was ready, Janott offered to call people to watch as Amidala sang the song if she wanted an audience but she replied there wouldn't be much for anyone to hear or see.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nSome time later, after Amidala had left Batuu, her [[Marriage|husband]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] arrived to search for her and teamed up with a [[Chiss]] called [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]]. The two of them interrogated Janott about Amidala and Duja, but before they got anything substantial out of the bartender, they fell under attack from a group of separatist agents. The initial [[gas]] attack knocked Janott out instead of its intended targets. While Janott was unconscious, Thrawn fixed a listening device into his [[clothing]] that enabled him to listen what happened in the cantina after he had Skywalker left. A group of thieves who had been skimming the separatist's shipments carried Janott to another shop close by, but they were observed by [[Oenti]] and his separatist allies.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Janott}}\n*''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn: Alliances (audiobook)|''Thrawn: Alliances'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn: Alliances (audiobook)|''Thrawn: Alliances'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fi=Janott\n|fr=Janott\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
