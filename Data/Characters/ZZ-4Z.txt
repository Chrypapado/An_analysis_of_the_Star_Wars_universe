ZeeZee remained there for several generations, and endeared himself to many of the academy's cadets, including [[Mako Spince]]. When Spince was expelled from the academy, he took ZeeZee with him to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], where the droid was eventually lost in a game of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]]. He came to be the property of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and was tasked with maintaining the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler's]] [[Han Solo's apartment|apartment]] on Nar Shaddaa while Han was away.\n\nZeeZee was very fastidious and worrisome, but so antiquated and poorly maintained that he was unable to keep Solo's apartment as tidy as he saw fit. As a result, the little droid often complained in a stuttering, static way about how messy and dirty the apartment was&mdash;even though it was his job to keep it clean. When Solo left Nar Shaddaa just prior to joining the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], he left Zeezee behind.\n\nApproximately [[10 ABY/Legends|six years]] after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], when [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] reappeared in a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] body, Han returned to Nar Shaddaa with his wife, [[Leia Organa Solo]]. Upon entering his old apartment, he encountered ZeeZee, still attempting to carry out his assignment, who informed him that a \"Mr. Fett\" was waiting to see him. Alarmed at what this could mean, Han and Leia attempted to leave but were stopped short by [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], thus learning that he had survived the [[Sarlacc/Legends|sarlacc]]. He told them that the bounty on their heads had gone up, and while the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] wanted Han dead, they wanted Leia alive to pay for killing [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]]. A firefight ensued, and ZZ-4Z was destroyed in the crossfire.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Droids (1995) 2|''Droids '' 2]]\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*[[Dark Empire 3|''Dark Empire'' 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Empire 4|''Dark Empire'' 4]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Aurra Sing: Dawn of the Bounty Hunters]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{FFCite|36|HOU3-4, ''Household Service Droids''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=ZZ-4Z\n}}\n\n[[Category:Droids with masculine programming]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Service droids]]"}}}]}}}}
