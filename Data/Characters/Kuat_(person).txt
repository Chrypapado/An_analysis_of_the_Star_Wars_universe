And through times perhaps more difficult than any faced by your predecessors; you've proven yourself to be the true heir of the Kuat Drive Yards' helm.|Kuat Drive Yards \u03b2-supervisor|Hard Merchandise}}\n'''Kuat of Kuat''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], from a [[Kuat/Legends|planet]] which bore a name identical to his. At the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], he was the hereditary CEO and chief designer of [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]], one of the three largest [[Starship/Legends|starship]] manufacturers in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. He was the nephew of [[Onara Kuat]] and followed his [[Kuat's father|father]] as [[Kuat of Kuat]]. During his time as head of Kuat Drive Yards, he carried the simple title of \"[[Technician (title)|Technician]].\"\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I would rather see Kuat Drive Yards, my heritage and the work of generations of Kuats before me, utterly destroyed and in ruins before letting it fall into the control of the Empire.|Kuat of Kuat|Slave Ship}}\nDuring the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Kuat disagreed with his aunt on many occasions, and even blocked her attempt to have Senator [[Giddean Danu/Legends|Giddean Danu]] recalled from office.\n\nAs the Imperial military-industrial complex swallowed KDY's competitors, Kuat fought to protect the independence of his family, planet, and firm. This, combined with his opposition to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star project]], made him unpopular amongst some of the ruling Kuati families and the Imperial elite.\n\nKuat orchestrated a labyrinthine conspiracy to embarrass and destroy the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] crime syndicate. This conspiracy also led to the break up of the [[Bounty Hunters' Guild/Legends|Bounty Hunters' Guild]] into warring factions.\n\nLater, in fear of losing control of the [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]], Kuat wired the entire construction docks with explosives. [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] flew the [[Hound's Tooth/Legends|''Hound's Tooth'']] into the exploding construction area, where he found Kuat inside one of the larger ships waiting for his imminent death.\n\nAfter a series of questions about the [[Bombing of the Dune Sea|bombing raid]] of the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]], Boba Fett made Kuat leave the ship. Fett managed to pilot the ship into the vacuum of space. In the aftermath, Kuat was killed by the [[Bombing of the Kuat shipyards (4 ABY)|explosions]], but the ship that Fett flew into space was a key part of the explosives, and the removal of the ship disrupted the process; 80% of the docks survived, thanks to Fett.\n\nKuat often kept a pet [[Felinx/Legends|felinx]] as company. When he left the Star Destroyer to wait for his death in the docks, Kuat found that his loyal felinx had managed to find its way out of his private quarters and tracked him there. He held the felinx close to his chest so he could listen to its heartbeat instead of the destruction around them.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Mandalorian Armor]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Slave Ship]]''\n*''[[Hard Merchandise]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|13|KUA3-4, ''Kuat Drive Yards''}}\n*{{FFCite|61|MES2, ''Messenger Droids''}}\n*''[[Platt's Starport Guide]]'' {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*{{GamerCite|6|How the Other Half Hunts}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' <!-- p. 131 -->\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' <!-- Kuat of Kuat -->\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|onarakuat|Kuat, Onara|archivedate=20100209160513}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=Head of the [[House Kuat|Kuat family]] and Director of [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]]\n|years=After [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]&ndash;[[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]\n|before=[[Kuat's father]]\n|after=Unknown\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kuat von Kuat#legends\n|es=Kuat (persona)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kuati]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
