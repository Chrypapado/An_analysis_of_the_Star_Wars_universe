After the [[destruction of Alderaan]], he became an anti-[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] terrorist and [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]].\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], while Farnor was off-[[Planet/Legends|planet]] on a business trip, his mate and his children were killed in the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. When he returned to find nothing but [[The Graveyard|asteroids and rubble]] where his home once was, the enraged Khil embarked on a solitary crusade against the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\nFarnor took to acts of [[Pirate/Legends|piracy]] and terrorism, attacking unarmed [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]] and [[scout vessel]]s in Imperial space. He continued to seek violent revenge in Imperial space, even after the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. By [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], he had even destroyed [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] property and murdered New Republic personnel in the course of his vendetta.<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\nWhile the Imperial authorities believed him to be a New Republic agent, the New Republic considered him to be a serious threat. [[General/Legends|General]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]], head of [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]], believed that many non-aligned worlds had aligned themselves with the Empire as a result of Farnor's terrorism, and that his actions provoked hostilities in places where peaceful settlements were possible. Cracken set a reward of 10,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to anyone who stopped Farnor&mdash;preferably by capturing him alive, as Cracken reasoned that Farnor could be rehabilitated with proper counseling. Cracken also pointed out that if the New Republic could not stop Farnor, the Empire would score a propaganda victory by killing him.<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\nFarnor's vessel, a modified [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]], was frequently seen in the [[Trans-Hydian|Borderland Regions]] separating the Empire and the Republic. Farnor equipped himself with a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]], [[blast vest]], and [[Blast helmet/Legends|blast helmet]].<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wanted by Cracken]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 12: Aliens \u2014 Enemies and Allies]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Greldo Farnor#legends\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farnor, Greldo}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Khil]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Terrorists]]"}}}]}}}}
