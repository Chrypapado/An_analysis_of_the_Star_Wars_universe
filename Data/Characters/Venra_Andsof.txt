At some point during [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] history, Andsof accompanied Troper to the [[Ithorian Herdship/Legends|herdship]] ''[[Galactic Horizon]]'', to attend some peace talks. However, the former [[Scout/Legends|scout]] [[Dayla Kev]] hijacked the conference, seeking revenge against Troper for abandoning her to [[Death/Legends|die]] on a jungle [[Planet/Legends|world]] many [[Standard year/Legends|years]] earlier. Kev and her allies released various dangerous predators aboard the [[Starship/Legends|ship]], driving Andsof, Troper and several of their security guards deep into the jungle biosphere of the ship, while falling under constant attack from the creatures.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|6|Welcome to the Jungle}} {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Andsof, Venra}}\n[[Category:Diplomats]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lorrdians]]"}}}]}}}}
