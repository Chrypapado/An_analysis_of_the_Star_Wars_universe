Kodo offered [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] but the leader of the gang, a [[Duros/Legends|Duros]], still expressed a desire to cause harm to the two [[Omwati/Legends|Omwati]] as a message to Kodo from Xizor for he and his wife to keep silent. [[Ekria]], [[Zonder]] and [[Drake Lo'gaan]] came to their rescue, however not before the Duros was able to hit Kodo once. The punch resulted in fourth-stage burns in the shape of the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] symbol.
