He was the audience for Arica's audition as a dancing girl and in the end hired her for the Hutt.\n\nSeen as a petty man who enjoyed what little power he wielded, the Fat Man tried to impress people with his so-called \"Important Person\" routine, where he boasted of how he was once used to protect Jabba's anonymity by being sent out to meet with people. This in turn caused some on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] to believe he was actually the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] himself.\n\n[[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], who was posing as Arica to infiltrate [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]], saw this as a backhanded compliment; though he was trusted enough to finalize the Hutt's deals, he was effectively \"assassin bait,\" and therefore expendable.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Opunmcgrrrr.jpg|thumb|right|The Fat Man's possible appearance.]]\nThough no explicit connection exists in canon, the Fat Man is almost certainly one and the same as [[Heater (henchman)|Heater]]. The Fat Man's depiction in ''[[Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade]]'' implies that he was intended as a [[retcon]] of [[Declan Mulholland]]'s portrayal of Jabba that was cut from [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], before the scene was later reinserted with a CG Jabba in the [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]]. Conceived for this same purpose, Heater first appeared in the [[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]], taking Jabba's place in a now non-[[canon]] version of the scene. Heater's description and backstory in ''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'', published in [[November]] [[1995]], are nearly identical to the Fat Man's, published just [[1996|two months]] later in ''[[Tales from Jabba's Palace]]''.<ref name=\"EGC\">''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'', page 79.</ref><ref name=\"Sleight of Hand\" /> It is extremely unlikely that this is coincidental, as [[Andy Mangels]], writer of the ''Essential Guide'', has said that he coordinated information with manuscripts and novels that were in the works.<ref name=\"TFN Andy Mangels\">{{Cite_web|url=http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/mangels.asp|title=Jedi Council - Interviews - Andy Mangels|author=Paul Ens|date=1999-08-0|work=Interviews - Face To Face With The Masters|publisher=[[TheForce.net]]|archivedate=20190730114027}}</ref> The fact that [[Melina Carniss]]\u2014also conceived by Zahn for Mara Jade's short story\u2014first appeared in the guide further suggests this coordination.<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n\nDespite this, it is also possible that the Fat Man is [[Opun Mcgrrrr]] from the short story [[Spare Parts (short story)|''Spare Parts'']] (November 1996), whose likeness, too, was taken from Mulholland. Mcgrrr's backstory does not match the Fat Man and Heater's identical one, but as the Fat Man's true name is left ambiguous, he cannot be ruled out. With Heater's only prominent appearance effectively non-canon, it should be noted that Mcgrrr's status in continuity is more stable.\n\nThere is also no direct contradiction that would prevent all three of these men, sharing the same physical appearance, from being various personae of one being.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fat Man}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
