My captor found me useful, to speak with the other Wookiee slaves.|Ralrracheen|Heir to the Empire}}\n'''Ralrracheen''', also called '''Ralrra''', was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who served as an [[Ambassador/Legends|ambassador]] for [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] after dealing with the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I to you, Leiaorganasolo, bring greetings. I to Rwookrrorro welcome you.|Ralrracheen|Heir to the Empire}}\nRalrracheen had a speech impediment which made him easier to understand when speaking to non-Wookiees, a useful trait when dealing with others in his diplomatic work. Later, he became a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]], and was used by his Imperial masters to communicate with other Wookiees. At first, he tried to resist Imperial occupation forces, but forced himself to comply after they executed a dozen women and children from his family unit. His proximity to [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officers]] provided him with information vital to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance's]] effort to free Kashyyyk. Like most Wookiees, after the Alliance freed Kashyyyk, he felt he owed a [[Life debt/Legends|life debt]] to the Alliance. At some point in his life he moved to the capital of Kashyyyk, [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]].\n\nWhen [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] brought [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo]] to Kashyyyk to keep her safe from [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]] Death Commandos, Ralrra was one of two Wookiees assigned to protect her. He stayed with her at the home of [[Salporin/Legends|Salporin]], which the Noghri later attacked. The Noghri set fire to the surrounding homes providing a distraction, and slipped into Salporin's home. in the following battle, Salporin was killed and Ralrra was injured by one of the stun weapons they were using. He then traveled under the city with [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], and Leia, so that they could escape to their ship, the borrowed [[Lady Luck/Legends|''Lady Luck'']]. After the mission to protect her he attended the funeral of [[Salporin/Legends|Salporin]].\n\nYears later, Ralrra was present at [[Funeral of Chewbacca|Chewbacca's funeral]], caused by the attack on [[Sernpidal/Legends|Sernpidal]] by the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] early on in the [[Yuuzhan Vong War|war]]. Ralrracheen led the mourning ceremony. During the funeral, Ralrra spoke of the many great accomplishments of Chewbacca, and the many adventures he participated in.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nRalrracheen proved to have a strong will, and only allowed the Imperials to use him as slave after they killed several female Wookiees. He was also known for his ability to work with the members of other species, as shown in his job as a senator for the Galactic Republic.\n\n==Equipment==\nRalrracheen was known to fight with the traditional [[Ryyk blade/Legends|Ryyk blade]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Adventures: Chewbacca and the Slavers of the Shadowlands]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Tyrant's Test]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]'' {{C|As \"Ralrra\"}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{FFCite|9|CHE12, ''Chewbacca''}}\n*''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of [[Mytaranor sector/Legends|Mytaranor sector]]\n|years=pre-[[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]]\n|before=Unknown\n|after=Eventually [[Yarua/Legends|Yarua]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ralrracheen\n|es=Ralrracheen\n|ja=\u30e9\u30eb\u30e9\u30c1\u30fc\u30f3\n}}\n\n[[Category:Diplomats]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic senators]]\n[[Category:Imperial slaves]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
