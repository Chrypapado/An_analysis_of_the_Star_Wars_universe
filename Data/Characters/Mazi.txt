They tried to rob [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] but were called of by [[Ferus Olin]], who threatened to stop giving them odd jobs. Afterward, the three of them decided to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] as soldiers.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|There was a smashball tournament on Delaya.

Being the oldest of the three, Mazi acted as the leader of their group. [[Ferus Olin]], a former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and another survivor of Alderaan, tried to dissuade them from turning to crime by giving them odd jobs to earn [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. When [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] made a visit to [[Delaya/Legends|Delaya]] to assist the refugee effort and recruit new members to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], Mazi and his group attempted to rob Organa. [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] tried to placate the orphans but the standoff was broken when Olin intervened and disarmed Mazi, who was holding Organa at knife-point with a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]]. Mazi would later make amends for his behavior by informing Solo where Organa was taken when she was abducted by a rogue faction of Alderaanian refugees. After the incident, Mazi and his friends joined the Rebels as soldiers.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMazi was a character created by author [[Alex Wheeler]] for the [[2008]] novel ''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'', the second volume in the ''[[Star Wars: Rebel Force]]'' series.<ref name=\"Hostage\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
