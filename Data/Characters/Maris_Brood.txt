Trained by [[Gender/Legends|her]] [[Maris Brood's Master|Master]] on the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Gray Pilgrim]]'', she was distanced from the rest of the Order during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Due to their isolation, Brood and her Master did not fall victim to the execution of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]]. Still, the effects of the killings were felt even in seclusion; [[Force sense/Legends|sensing]] the near-simultaneous [[Death/Legends|deaths]] of so many [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Brood's Master set out to recover evidence of their fate.<ref name=\"TFU databank\" />\n\nHer Master disappeared, never to be seen again, but not before he was able to warn Brood of the destruction of the Jedi and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] role in the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]].

Ti instead sent her to the [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] graveyard, despite Brood's protestations that she was strong enough to stand alongside her Master.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\" /> After Ti was defeated and killed by Starkiller, Brood was left without a master once more, stranded and alone on Felucia.

The loss of her mentor had plunged Brood deeper into darkness; an effect that spread throughout the planet, infecting the Felucians with the dark side.<ref name=\"TFU databank\" /> Brood captured the Senator and kept him as her [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]], planning to offer him to [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader, should he ever find her, in exchange for her life.

Begging for her life with the promise of redeeming herself of the dark side's influence, she convinced Starkiller to let her go. Organa protested, recalling Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side.

Brood herself was keen to bring the fight to the enemy, though this impulse was held back by Shaak Ti. She was more open to giving into her baser urges and primal emotions than heeding her Master's example of calmness and patience. Despite her inclinations toward the dark side, Ti believed that it was due more to Brood's fear than anger.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nAfter Ti's death, Maris Brood's sense of abandonment and betrayal at having been left alone on Felucia resulted in her immersion in the dark side of the Force, though she would later claim that this was because of the dark nature of the planet itself.<ref name=\"TFU databank\" /> Her fear of death at Darth Vader's hands made her more than willing to place her own survival above all else, taking hostages and potentially trading them to the Empire in exchange for her life.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nSuch was her fear of death that Maris Brood resorted to begging for her life at the hands of Starkiller. The apprentice judged such behavior unworthy of the dark side, believing that Brood's failure to control her fear was a weakness that caused an aspiring [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] to become a coward who pleaded for mercy. Although Brood swore to renounce the dark side, Bail Organa and Starkiller both doubted her sincerity.<ref name=\"TFUn\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|She hasn't been corrupted. Not yet.

Both undertook to train her in the use of the Force and the ways of the Jedi.

When selected, however, cutscenes are disabled. In the N-Gage/iPhone versions of the game, Brood holds Organa inside a downed [[Munificent-class star frigate/Legends|''Munificent''-class star frigate]]. When Starkiller defeats her there, she does not beg for her life. Instead, the Sith apprentice decides to spare her by himself.<ref name=\"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\" />\n\nIn 2010 Maris appeared as one of the eight playable duelists in the Wii version of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]''. Concept art was also included on the Wii version, with a noticeably different outfit, indicating that she was originally intended to make an appearance in the main game.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Maris Brood|imagecat=Images of Maris Brood}}\n*[[The Force Unleashed (novel)|''The Force Unleashed'' novel]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (comic)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'' comic]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'' video game]]\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II'' video game]] {{C|Wii version only}}\n*[[The Force Unleashed II (novel)|''The Force Unleashed II'' novel]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/FUpreview2|text=''The Force Unleashed'' Preview 2|int=The Force Unleashed Preview 2: Maris Brood and Kazdan Paratus|archivedate=20071021025307}}\n*{{SWMiniCite|set=The Force Unleashed|pack=Maris Brood|link=SWminiTFU53maris.asp|archivedate=20160406220336}}\n*''[[The Art and Making of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]''\n*''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Fandex Deluxe Edition]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Rebellion Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode315.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Overlords|archivedate=20110701055324}}\n*{{InsiderCite|125|50 Great Reasons to Rewatch Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season Three|50 Great Reasons to Rewatch ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' Season Three}}\n*{{DB|location|felucia|Felucia|archivedate=20101129154524}}\n*{{DB|character|marisbrood|Brood, Maris|archivedate=20100328113716}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'' {{C|Card: Shaak Ti}} {{Imo}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/f20071031/index.html|text=''The Force Unleashed'': Co-Star Evolution|archiveurl=https://archive.is/PWEqd}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=collecting/shop/shopnews/news20071219.html|text=''Force Unleashed'' Figures now at StarWarsShop|archivedate=20080605094914}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/news20080403.html|text=The Force Will Be Unleashed on September 16|archivedate=20080405131019}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Maris Brood\n|de=Maris Brood#legends\n|es=Maris Brood\n|fi=Maris Brood\n|fr=Maris Brood\n|hu=Maris Brood\n|it=Maris Brood\n|nl=Maris Brood\n|pl=Maris Brood\n|pt=Legends:Maris Brood\n|ru=\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0411\u0440\u0443\u0434\n|sv=Maris Brood\n|tr=Maris Brood\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brood, Maris}}\n[[Category:Felucia residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jedi Commanders]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Redeemed Jedi]]\n[[Category:Zabrak]]"}}}]}}}}
