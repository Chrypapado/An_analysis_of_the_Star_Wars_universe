He felt that Gands were victims of discriminatory laws and lacked opportunity. He eventually came into the employ of [[Lars Baddeg]], the leader of the [[Justicars' Brigade|Justicars]], where G'luun and his group of Gand [[Scavenger/Legends|scavengers]] were tasked to keep the [[Noetikon]] out of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] hands. G'luun adopted a complex system of [[Computer/Legends|computerized]] signals that alerted his fellow Gands when to pass the [[Jedi artifact/Legends|Jedi artifact]] to another.<ref name=\"TOR-SS\">''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''&ndash;\"Secret Signals\" on Coruscant</ref>\n\nAfter [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] security forces spotted one of the Gands with the artifact, the [[Migrant Merchants' Guild headquarters|Guild]] was barricaded to prevent the Gands from escaping and [[Unidentified Gand scavenger|one of G'luun's underlings]] was captured. With the information from the underling, a [[Jedi Consular]] activated the signal device in the [[Migrant Merchants' Guild market]], which attracted G'luun's attention. G'luun was told that if he relinquished the [[Noetikon of Science|Noetikon]], the barricade would be removed and he and the other Gands would be permitted to leave Coruscant. G'luun complied to these orders.<ref name=\"TOR-SS\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:G'luun, Aulus}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Gand]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scavengers]]"}}}]}}}}
