She feared the retribution of [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]], who was no friend of Soontir Fel. They spent months in hiding before Syal was reunited with Soontir, who had defected to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] after being captured.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" /> They continued to remain in hiding, however, and Fel's very existence was apparently kept secret, with not even Syal's brother, [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], seeming to know of the children's existence.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" /><ref name=\"Iron Fist\">''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]''</ref> Not long afterward, Isard succeeded in capturing Soontir, turning him over to [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]], known by his [[Core name/Legends|core name]] Thrawn. Thrawn convinced Soontir that he needed his aid in pacifying the myriad threats of the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Soontir became a [[General/Legends|general]] in the [[Empire of the Hand]], which Thrawn had set up to bring stability to the Unknown Regions.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref> A few months later, Syal and the children joined him, their disappearance engineered by Thrawn, on the Empire of the Hand's headquarters on [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]].<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" /><ref name=\"Fact File 122\" />\n\nFel was reared in the Unknown Regions, where he and Davin were joined by two younger brothers&mdash;[[Jagged Fel|Jagged]] and [[Cem Fel|Cem]], with Cem being hidden from all others outside the family as a [[shadow child]] to preserve the line&mdash;and two younger sisters&mdash;[[Cherith Fel|Cherith]] and [[Wynssa Fel|Wynssa]].<ref name=\"Ruin\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /><ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /> When Thrawn returned to the known regions of space to take command of the Empire, the Empire of the Hand was left in the hands of [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Voss Parck/Legends|Voss Parck]], with Soontir a senior officer. The Empire of the Hand remained secret, battling against the various threats found in the Unknown Regions. It consisted not only of Thrawn's Imperial forces but of members of Thrawn's species who rejected the ban their society, the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]], imposed on preemptive strikes.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" />\n\nFel was raised by his father among the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] and to Chiss standards, becoming a warrior dedicated to the protection of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], though he did not attend the [[Syndic Mitth'raw'nuruodo training academy|Chiss academy]] that Davin and Jagged did, instead gaining his education through exclusively Imperial facilities.<ref name=\"Ruin\" /><ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" /><ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\">''[[Red Sky, Blue Flame]]''</ref> Fel entered the pilot corps of the Empire of the Hand's fleet, where he was promoted to the rank of [[Commander/Legends|commander]] by [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], leading a [[fleet-arm]] of [[Nssis-class Clawcraft|''Nssis''-class clawcraft]]. He gained much combat experience and received numerous medals and distinctions in his years of combat operations, making his father proud. Fel worked with elements of the [[501st Legion (Empire of the Hand)|501st Legion]] during his time with the Empire of the Hand, though not in combat; his skill and role was in the cockpit of a clawcraft.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" /> Fel's early career was not all happiness; by [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], his brother Davin had died in combat.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\n===Investigating ''Outbound Flight''===\n====Aboard the ''Chaf Envoy''====\n{{Quote|You have to look at it from his point of view. First of all, we're supposed to be honored diplomatic guests, not volunteer firefighters.''\"<br />\"''That's Formbi's point of view, not Drask's. At least the honored part is.|Chak Fel and Mara Jade Skywalker|Survivor's Quest}}\nIn 22 ABY, Parck received a message from [[Aristocra/Legends|Aristocra]] [[Chaf'orm'bintrano]] of the Chiss Ascendancy requesting that Parck relay a message to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] inviting them to participate in a [[Expedition to Outbound Flight|voyage]] to the newly discovered ruins of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic's]] [[Outbound Flight Project]], destroyed by Thrawn before the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Parck sent the message to [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]]. Parck also sent Fel and [[Unit Aurek-Seven]]&mdash;[[Su-mil]], known by the warrior name Grappler; [[Watchman (stormtrooper)|Watchman]]; [[Shadow (stormtrooper)|Shadow]]; and [[Cloud (stormtrooper)|Cloud]]&mdash;of the 501st Legion as his representatives and as guards for Chaf'orm'bintrano. He told them that the task would be dangerous and the Chiss would need protection, but did not reveal to Fel the nature of the danger. He also sent with them a complete copy of the operational manual for ''[[Outbound Flight]]'', which he had found in Thrawn's records.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nWhen Fel arrived at the meeting point of [[Crustai]] and boarded the expedition ship, the ''[[Chaf Envoy]]'', he was greeted by Aristocra Chaf'orm'bintrano, who went by the core name Formbi. He saw little of Formbi afterwards, and General [[Prard'ras'kleoni]], or Drask, commander of the ''Chaf Envoy''{{'s}} military complement, was distinctly unhappy with their presence aboard his ship. Fel found that the New Republic had sent a representative as well, [[Ambassador/Legends|Ambassador]] [[Dean Jinzler]]. Fel and the four [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] serving as his bodyguard spent much of their time aboard their ship, docked within the ''Chaf Envoy'', wishing to remain out of the way. Eventually, a refugee ship arrived. Its passengers informed the Chiss that they were [[Geroon (species)|Geroons]], victims of the [[Vagaari/Legends|Vagaari]] who wished to travel to ''Outbound Flight''{{'s}} crash site and pay tribute to the men and women who had saved them from Vagaari enslavement, to which Formbi agreed. The Vagaari had been marauders through the Unknown Regions earlier, but were defeated at the battle at which ''Outbound Flight'' was destroyed.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nShortly after the Skywalkers arrived, Fel heard the sound of a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] being activated and took Aurek Squad to investigate. He found Mara Jade Skywalker hanging from a ceiling pillar in the entrance chamber, examining a cable which had swung loose and nearly struck her husband when they were arriving earlier. Fel greeted her, and when he requested that they compare notes about the mission, she took him back to the cabin she shared with her husband, being suspicious of spies. They spoke briefly, with Fel lying that he had been sent by Parck to guard them, an idea that did not appeal to the fiercely independent Jade Skywalker.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nFel returned to his quarters and changed into his dress uniform for the diplomatic dinner with the rest of the guests that night. While heading there, he encountered Jinzler in the hallway and spoke briefly about the operational manual he had, asking if Jinzler had any similar records against which he could compare his; Jinzler did not. During dinner, there was an explosion and fire near Fel's ship. The fire-suppression system malfunctioned, and as the stormtroopers were nearest and had their own air supplies, they went in to put it out. They reported to Fel that the fire was dangerously near the fuel supply, and that they had found what they thought was a conduit for extinguisher foam. Fel recruited the Jedi to use their lightsabers to scratch the conduit with a lightsaber just enough to see what liquid was actually inside&mdash;they did not want to accidentally unleash a flood of flammable liquid. They did so, found that it was indeed a fire-suppression foam conduit, and successfully put out the fire.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nAfterwards, he spoke again with the Skywalkers. They discussed whether the explosion could have been sabotage, but could find no motive for it. Fel offered to let them see the operational manual to try to look for answers as to what aboard ''Outbound Flight'' could be valuable, but upon reaching his ship Fel found that the datacards had been stolen, with the fire as a likely distraction. Due to several people having been nearby when Fel discussed the datacards with Jinzler, they were unable to narrow down the suspects in the theft.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nFel spent the next several days mostly aboard his shuttle, though when the ''Chaf Envoy'' arrived at [[Brask Oto Command Station]], he, the Skywalkers, Jinzler, and the Geroons were all called together. Formbi informed them that they would now be entering an exceptionally dangerous star cluster known as the [[Redoubt]] and asked them all to confirm that they wished to proceed. All did. During the trip into the Redoubt, the ''Chaf Envoy'' dropped out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], having developed engine problems. Fel, suspecting more sabotage serving as a distraction, dispatched Unit Aurek-Seven to secure various places that would be possible targets for the mysterious intriguer onboard. The stormtrooper Su-mil found Jinzler skulking near the shield generator, but the man claimed that he had in fact been pursuing an intruder himself. Su-mil did find that a repeater had been placed in the ship's navigational lines; however, he was not able to ascertain who had done so.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\n====Exploring the ruins====\n{{Quote|Would it help to tell you we come in peace, and in the hope of helping you and your people?''\"<br />\"''Not really, no.|Chak Fel and Jorad Pressor|Survivor's Quest}}\nOnce they arrived, they found the six [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|Dreadnaughts]] of ''Outbound Flight'' crashed, with most of them buried under a layer of scree. Fel, in his dress uniform, was present with the other dignitaries for a ceremony upon entering the first Dreadnaught, the only one accessible to the surface. While Formbi recited apologies for the Chiss role in the destruction of the project, Skywalker sensed [[Survivors (Outbound Flight)|survivors]] aboard one of the buried Dreadnaughts. They prepared a rescue party, and soon Fel, Unit Aurek-Seven, the Jedi, Jinzler, four Geroons, Formbi and his aide [[Chaf'ees'aklaio|Feesa]], Drask, and three Chiss guards began to make their way into ''Outbound Flight''. Fel and one of his men were in the middle of the group with the other three troopers behind, boxing the Geroons in between them. Their progress though the damaged ship was slow, but eventually they found the fleet tactical room, where Fel made a distraction by attempting to access the ship's records while the Jedi investigated what seemed to be an individual ahead. Drask, however, noticed and slipped away to follow them. They were captured by the suspicious survivors, making noise that the rest investigated.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\n[[File:OutboundFlightRuins.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The wreckage of ''Outbound Flight''.]]\nFel and his stormtroopers brought up the rear as the others led. They were met by a young girl named [[Evlyn Tabory|Evlyn]], who promised to lead them to the survivors. Instead, she led them into a trap. Fel's party was cut off from all the others in a disguised [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]] car and plummeted briefly before it came to rest. A voice identifying itself as [[Jorad Pressor]], [[Guardian of the People]], informed him that the turbolift car was balanced between powerful opposing [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsors]], with their circuitry embedded in the walls of the car. Any attempt to cut their way out would destroy some of circuity and disable at least one of the repulsors, sending them crashing into one end of the tube or the other at fatal velocity. Pressor further informed them to wait until he came to a decision regarding their fates. With their comlinks jammed, Fel immediately began covering the monitor in the car while the stormtroopers scanned the pattern of circuits around it. They came up with a plan to access the control wires and slowly ease down the power on the repulsors. Putting it into practice, they headed toward the central supply core, not wishing to follow Jinzler's car, which they had heard descending, directly to the next Dreadnaught. In the supply core, they came across the Skywalkers and Drask, who had also managed to escape their own turbolift trap. Drask browbeat him for leaving Formbi without his protection, but Fel could not help being separated from the Aristocra.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nThe Skywalkers split off to investigate the [[Dreadnaught-One|command Dreadnaught]], buried deepest, while Fel and his stormtroopers made their way to ''[[Dreadnaught-Six]]'', there to investigate it quickly and move to ''[[Dreadnaught-Five]]'' from an unexpected angle to provide aid to the others, now aboard ''Dreadnaught Five'', if needed. After arguing with the impatient Drask, Fel led the group to investigate an occupied area of the Dreadnaught. Fel and Drask led the way in to what they found was a nursery for the children of the Outbound Flight survivors. The stormtroopers came under fire, causing the group to retreat. Fel wanted to move on to ''Dreadnaught-Five'', but Drask insisted on investigating what the residents were protecting, as they had been away from the nursery. Fel consented and the stormtroopers stunned the [[Peacekeeper (Outbound Flight Colony)|Peacekeepers]] who had fired on them. They then continued moving, finding a prison set up on the same Dreadnaught. Fel spoke to the two women caring for the children inside, who informed him that the children had been locked up due to being suspected of [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]]; for unknown reasons, the Outbound Flight survivors had a deep fear and hatred of Jedi. Fel was angered by the imprisonment of the children, but had more pressing matters to attend to and moved on at Drask's urging.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\n====Surprise attack====\n{{Quote|Then let us show the Vagaari what it means to wage war on the Chiss Ascendancy and the Empire of the Hand.|Prard'ras'kleoni, to Chak Fel|Survivor's Quest}}\nDuring their trip, the comlink jamming went down, with Jinzler immediately reporting that the Geroons were in fact Vagaari and that they were under attack by the Vagaari's [[wolvkil]] attack beasts in the conference room they had been sharing with the survivor leadership. The Vagaari themselves were spreading [[line creeper]]s throughout ''Outbound Flight'' to shut down the power and kill the inhabitants. Fel spoke with the Skywalkers, with both rushing to come to the diplomatic party's aid. Drask attempted to contact the ''Chaf Envoy'', but it did not answer. The Vagaari craft had been packed with warriors in suspended animation who now emerged to make their way down into ''Dreadnaught-Five'' to reinforce the others.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\n[[File:Aurek_7_FB.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Three of the members of Unit Aurek-Seven in combat.]]\nWhile waiting for the turbolift to arrive to take them to ''Dreadnaught-Five'', the stormtroopers detected that the car was too heavy. Fel prepared to ambush the presumably Vagaari occupants as they arrived. The Vagaari came out firing, and Fel was attacked behind his cover by a wolvkil. It was able to shrug off his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shots, leaping on him and biting his right arm. After a struggle with the beast, Shadow arrived just in time to prevent the wolvkil tearing out Fel's throat and, with the help of the other stormtroopers, kill it. That group of Vagaari defeated, Fel had his arm tended to before he made the decision to turn command of the stormtroopers over to General Drask, a career ground officer; Fel realized he could not command the stormtroopers as effectively as Drask could, and would not let pride stand in the way of having the most efficient leadership. Drask graciously made it a joint command.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nUpon arriving aboard ''Dreadnaught-Five'', Drask and Fel planned a surprise attack on the Vagaari guarding the aft turbolift, the one they would need to return to the surface. He, Drask, Cloud, and Su-mil planned to attack the Vagaari, driving them back into the turbolift where Watchman and Shadow could ambush them within the shaft. Before attacking, Fel fired a Vagaari blaster a few times, drawing a group of Vagaari away from the main guard to, they thought, aid some of their compatriots. That group was quickly cut down, reducing the number of troops they would have to attack. Fel used his knowledge of the Dreadnaught's layout to find an overlooked corridor they could use to ambush the guards.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nThe stormtroopers led the attack from the narrow corridor, and when the return fire became too intense, they sealed the door and prepared to retreat. Turning to leave, at the back of the formation, Fel found a line of Vagaari sneaking up on them. Fel immediately began attacking, but the situation looked grim. Both stormtroopers were injured, with their armor wearing down under sustained fire, and Fel and Drask were unarmored. They were able to fight their way to an access into the turbolift anteroom, where there would be more Vagaari but the Imperials would not be so hemmed in. A [[Concussion grenade/Legends|concussion grenade]] allowed them time to get through safely, but the Vagaari were beginning to recover before they could make their way to cover. A turbolift car arrived, which they entered, but they found the controls locked down. Despairing of his life, Fel was surprised when Watchman and Cloud burst through the ceiling and eliminated the Vagaari threatening them; he had forgotten about them in the heat of battle.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nThey met up with the Jedi shortly after that, with the Dreadnaught now clear of Vagaari. The Vagaari blew apart the pylon connecting ''[[Dreadnaught-Four]]'', which they had first entered, to the other Dreadnaughts and blasted off, leaving Fel and the others stranded. While they recovered, it came out that Formbi had known that the \"Geroons\" were Vagaari. He had deliberately sent his message to Parck with enough signal leakage for the Vagaari, who had been gathering their strength recently, to hear it. He accepted them aboard the ''Chaf Envoy'' in hopes of having them make the first strike against the Chiss and in so doing allow the Chiss Ascendancy to go to war with them. He had expected them to attempt to steal the ship and flee, not knowing they had brought such numbers stored in their transport. Soon enough, they were contacted by the crew of the ''Chaf Envoy'', who had been left undisturbed, waiting for an attack on the command center while the Vagaari simply left. Fel and the stormtroopers were transferred to ''Dreadnaught-Six'' to recover from their wounds while the Skywalkers piloted a [[Delta-12 Skysprite-class|Delta-12 ''Skysprite'']] which had been stored aboard the ship in pursuit of the Vagaari, hoping to warn the Ascendancy before the Vagaari escaped.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nThe Skywalkers were successful in retaking the Dreadnaught from the Vagaari, and were even able to find the location of the Vagaari fleet, giving it to the Chiss. They returned to the crash site with Chiss forces who evacuated both the diplomatic party and the ''Outbound Flight'' residents, who, unwilling to return to the New Republic, accepted Fel's offer of a place in the Empire of the Hand. Fel and his troopers did not stay to oversee the evacuation, however, instead heading off with Drask to take part in the strike against the Vagaari fleet. They successfully attacked the fleet, using the element of surprise to destroy it.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\n===War and death===\n[[File:NssisClassClawcraft-NEGVV.png|thumb|right|200px|A clawcraft, Fel's ship of choice.]]\n{{Quote|Chak, Davin, and Cherith are all dead.''\"<br />\"''I'm sorry to hear that. I liked Chak very much.|Chaf'orm'bintrano and Luke Skywalker|Dark Nest I: The Joiner King}}\nDue to the injuries sustained to his forearm in his mauling by the wolvkil, Fel was no longer able to pilot a clawcraft, and had to give up command of his unit.

I'm just&hellip; I messed up. I hate when I mess up.|Chak Fel, to Luke Skywalker|Survivor's Quest}}\nChak Fel was an open, honest, and straightforward individual.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" /> Though Fel was raised by his father among the Chiss and to Chiss standards, he lacked the rigid, intense, Chiss-like discipline and grimness of his brother Jagged, possibly because he did not attend the Chiss academy both Jagged and Davin did but apparently was educated entirely within the Empire of the Hand's system.<ref name=\"Ruin\" /><ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" /><ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" />\n\nHe took great pride in the Empire of the Hand's accomplishments and his own achievements within it. The fact that his father was proud of him greatly pleased him. He deeply hated failing or letting others down, though he was willing to admit when he had done so. He was also willing to admit inexperience or lack of skill, as when he turned command of Unit Aurek-Seven over to Drask.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nFel was not willing to put those under his command in situations he would not put himself in; even while fighting aboard ''Outbound Flight'' without armor, he refused to let the armored stormtroopers handle all the combat, though this decision was also influenced by a desire not to appear cowardly to Drask.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\nFel was well-versed in military matters, knowing much about both Empire of the Hand and Chiss Ascendancy military practices and equipment. He had significant combat piloting experience; however, he had little experience in ground combat and, while familiar with the fundamentals of tactics, was not highly skilled. He was familiar with Chiss Ascendancy diplomatic and cultural matters as well. He was not, however, well-versed in matters of espionage or investigation; he was generally trusting and did not anticipate elaborately deceptive stratagems off the battlefield.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Chak Fel was created by author [[Timothy Zahn]] for the novel ''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' as the son of Soontir Fel, a character for whom Zahn held great affection.<ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\" /><ref name=\"An Interview With Timothy Zahn\">''[[An Interview With Timothy Zahn]]''</ref> Fel has only been directly mentioned by name in one other story, ''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nChak Fel's appearance in ''Survivor's Quest'', however, created continuity issues. ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'', published in [[2000]], and ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'', published in [[2002]], established five Fel siblings&mdash;Jagged, his older deceased brother Davin, his younger deceased sister Cherith, and two other unnamed children.<ref name=\"Ruin\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> ''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]'', published in [[2003]], filled in the missing two as Cem and Wynssa.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> All five children had been named when Chak Fel appeared in ''Survivor's Quest'' in [[2004]]. As Davin was the only Fel child of similar age to Chak, [[Lucas Licensing]] editor [[Sue Rostoni]] initially suggested that Chak was in fact Davin, with Chak being a nickname.<ref name=\"Sue\">[http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=93010&start=5475 Sue Rostoni on the StarWars.com Message Boards]</ref> This explanation was ultimately not integrated into canon, with ''Dark Nest I: The Joiner King'' establishing that Cem had been a shadow child known to none outside the family; all references to five Fel children were therefore misinformation and included Chak, Davin, Jagged, Cherith, and Wynssa.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\n''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 122]]'' established Soontir Fel as having multiple children before his defection; given the established chain of ages, these could only be Chak and Davin. While that issue of ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]'' was riddled with errors regarding the Fel family, this piece of information does not actually conflict with any canon and so has been incorporated into this article.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" /> Therefore, Chak Fel must have existed during Soontir Fel's time in the New Republic, but no mention of him was ever made, while Soontir constantly fretted about his wife, and no one in the New Republic displayed any knowledge of any Fel children, only of Syal, suggesting very strongly that Chak's existence was kept secret at this time.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]]</ref><ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" /><ref name=\"Iron Fist\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 122]]''\n*''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 140]]''\n*''[[An Interview With Timothy Zahn]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2011 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 6|cardname=Shea Standefer sketch cards}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|da=Chak Fel\n|de=Chak Fel\n|es=Chak Fel\n|ru=\u0427\u0430\u043a \u0424\u0435\u043b\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fel, Chak}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Empire of the Hand pilot corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Fel family]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Members of the 501st Legion]]\n[[Category:Nirauan residents]]"}}}]}}}}
