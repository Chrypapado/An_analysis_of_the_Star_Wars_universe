Give it to us, now.|Jubieck|Head Trip}}\n'''Jubieck''' was a [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] criminal who operated on [[Tolea Biqua]]. He found out that [[Ginder]] the [[Bimm (furred species)|Bimm]] was trying to sell the head of [[L8O-RC]], which had once belonged to [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. He figured that he could earn [[Nirama]]'s favor by retrieving the head for him, so he took [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] legbreakers [[Orix]] and [[Dimogog]] with him to shake Ginder down. Knowing that the Bimm had been seen repeatedly at the [[Falling Rodian]], the three thugs were there when Ginder met with a group of freelancers he was recruiting to help him. They did not make their move immediately, but when a group of [[Thaereian military|Thaereian]] soldiers arrived and tried to get the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] head, Jubieck and the Trandoshans approached, claiming the head belonged to Nirama. When Orix made a grab for the head, a three way battle commenced, but Ginder's allies kept control of the head.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20010419a|text=Head Trip|int=Head Trip|archivedate=20091015131221}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sullustans]]"}}}]}}}}
