Circa [[13 BBY/Legends|13 BBY]], Creel visited an [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] [[Journeyman Protector/Legends|Journeyman Protector]]&mdash;[[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], going by the name [[Jaster Mereel]]&mdash;who had been detained after murdering a corrupt [[Lenovar|fellow Protector]]. Although Creel admitted that the murdered [[Gender/Legends|man]] had been a disgrace to his office and [[Clothing/Legends|uniform]], he expressed to Mereel that he had no right in [[Death/Legends|killing]] him. Nevertheless, Mereel believed himself to be justified in his actions and told Creel to plead him unrepentant for the crime, despite the Pleader's warnings that he would be facing [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]] and perhaps even execution. After Creel defended Mereel at his murder trial, the court stripped Mereel of his belongings and exiled him from Concord Dawn.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|You're Iving Creel. I've heard of you.

Based on Fett's [[Reproduction/Legends|birth]] year of [[32 BBY/Legends|31.5 BBY]] {{C|see reference 1}}, mathematical deduction thereby places his exile in the year [[13 BBY/Legends|13 BBY]].</ref> Creel entered the [[Prison/Legends|jail]] cell of a recently [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] [[Journeyman Protector/Legends|Journeyman Protector]] of Concord Dawn going by the name [[Jaster Mereel]], in reality the young [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. Mereel,<ref name=\"Last One\" /> who had [[Death/Legends|killed]] his fellow Journeyman Protector and [[Commanding officer/Legends|superior officer]], [[Lenovar]], for raping his [[Sintas Vel|wife]],<ref name=\"Revelation\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''</ref> was facing [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]] and potential execution for his crime. Having come to hear Mereel's desired plea, which he would then announce before the body presiding over Mereel's case, Creel was surprised to hear from the indignant young man that he would stoically be pleading unrepentant. Indeed, Mereel felt himself justified in killing the other Journeyman Protector,<ref name=\"Last One\" /> a corrupt man<ref name=\"EGC\">''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> whom even Creel regarded as a disgrace to his [[Clothing/Legends|uniform]].<ref name=\"Last One\" />\n\nRegardless of Mereel's stated belief that the murdered man had it coming, as Creel explained to him, he had no justification in killing him. Creel proceeded to urge Mereel to swallow his pride and apologize for the crime, otherwise, he warned, Mereel would likely be executed himself for angering the ruling body. Although Mereel again explained that he only regretted that he had not killed the man sooner, Creel urged him one last [[Time/Legends|time]] to think upon his choice before exiting the jail cell with the unrepentant plea obtained.<ref name=\"Last One\" />\n\nBefore Creel left, however, Mereel flashed him a strange grin and stated bluntly that one must not love life too much, because everyone eventually dies. Creel found himself remembering that strange smile at odd moments throughout the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"Last One\" />\n\nCreel defended Mereel in his murder trial.<ref name=\"SWE\" /> For the murder of a fellow Journeyman Protector and his unrepentant plea, the Concord Dawn trial court stripped Mereel of all that he owned and exiled him from the planet. Boba Fett later went on to become known as the most notorious [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunter in the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].<ref name=\"Last One\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You can't love life too much, Pleader. Everyone dies.|Jaster Mereel|The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett}}\nWhen Pleader Iving Creel visited Jaster Mereel's cell to hear the younger man's plea for killing a fellow Journeyman Protector, Creel was taken back by Mereel's demeanor. Not only did Mereel not rise to greet Creel when he arrived, the discourtesy of which visibly disturbed the elder Creel, but the arrogant way in which Mereel examined Creel annoyed the older man and made him feel as if he were the one facing a trial court.<ref name=\"Last One\" />\n\nMereel's stark disregard for the murder initially perturbed Creel, who strongly urged the boy to simply apologize to the court in order to do what he could to save his own life. When Creel resignedly accepted Mereel's unrepentant plea and warned that he was likely facing his own death, Mereel retorted to the Pleader that he should not love life too much, for death would eventually befall everyone.<ref name=\"Last One\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Iving Creel was created by author [[Daniel Keys Moran]] for the short story ''[[The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett]]'', appearing in the [[1996]] anthology book ''[[Tales of the Bounty Hunters]]''.<ref name=\"Last One\" /> However, the character who would later be identified as Creel was first mentioned indirectly as Jaster Mereel's \"pleader\" in the [[1995]] reference book ''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''.<ref name=\"EGC\" /> While the character only appears fleetingly across two pages within Moran's story, he did receive individual entries in the [[1998]] ''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' and the [[2000]] ''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'', albeit mistakenly listed in both under the name \"'''Irving Creel'''.\"<ref name=\"SWE\" /><ref name=\"AGSWU\">''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' {{C|\"Creel, Pleader Irving\"}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' {{C|as \"Irving Creel\"}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|as \"Irving Creel\"}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Iving Creel\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Creel, Iving}}\n[[Category:Concord Dawn residents]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Legal professionals]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
