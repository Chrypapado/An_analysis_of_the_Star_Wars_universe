She was a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] sympathizer who would allow her nightclub to be used as a safehouse on occasion.\n\n==Biography==\nCorinna and her [[Twin/Legends|twin]] sister [[Kandria A'Daasha|Kandria]] were born into a wealthy family that provided for all their needs. As children they never struggled for anything and although her sister Kandria enjoyed a life of luxury, Corinna became bored and restless by it. Corinna ended up taking some of her wealth and left their household to explore [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Separation did not suit either sister and shortly afterwards Kandria joined Corinna on her travels. Kandria convinced Corinna to travel to the pleasure world of [[Adarlon/Legends|Adarlon]] but Corinna enjoyed her stay and the two sisters decided to try their hands at business.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\nThe twins started up the [[Glow Dome]] a nightclub featuring elaborate sound and light displays that became extremely successful. Despite her success, Corinna still felt unfilled by her life until she met a member of the underground group [[No-Holds-Barred]] that introduced Corinna to banned [[Hologram/Legends|holos]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. Shortly after her introduction to their cause, Corinna became sympathetic to the Rebellion and although she never formally joined she did allow underground holos to be sold through her nightclub and allowed Rebel operatives to use her business as a safehouse.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nCorinna had a rebellious streak that caused her to both reject her opulent upbringing as well as made her sympathetic to the Rebellion. She was also mischievous and enjoyed playing practical jokes, especially on boorish, obnoxious and mean-spirited people that would frequent her club. Corinna was a very attractive woman and wore tight-fitting clothes to accentuate her slim figure. She often wore a flight [[Jumpsuit/Legends|jumpsuit]] that was cut to be very revealing. One way that she would trick her clientele would be to work as a bartender in her nightclub, using the [[Holoprojector/Legends|holoprojectors]] to alter her appearance and disguise her true self.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nAlthough she was modestly skilled at ranged combat, Corinna's main strengths was her intelligence and business skills. She was a master negotiator and had a wide vocabulary in a large number of languages.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nMore practical than her sister, Corinna concealed both a [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]] and a [[vibroknife]] on her. She also carried around a personal holoplayer and datapad.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCorinna A'Daasha was designed by [[Paul Danner]] and [[Bill Smith]] for ''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'', a supplement for the ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' that was published by [[West End Games]] in [[1997]]. She was created as a co-owner of one of the bars and a potential contact for Rebel aligned player characters.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:A'Daasha, Corinna}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
