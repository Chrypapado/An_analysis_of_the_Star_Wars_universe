Kerritamba led an ongoing fight to protect his people and [[Kkowir Forest]] from the [[Sayormi]] clans of the [[Dead Forest (Kashyyyk)|Dead Forest]].\n\n==Biography==\nEarly in the Galactic Civil War, the [[Great Tree (Kashyyyk)|Great Tree]] of his village became diseased, leading to Kerritamba wanting a cure for it. To this end, he recruited an individual to go to the [[Myyydril Caverns]] and retrieve the cure's ingredients, which included a [[Nak'tra crystal]], [[Luilris mushroom]]s, and a [[Urnsor'is]]' [[Egg/Legends|egg]] sac.\n\nOnce his recruit returned, he sent the being back to retrieve an [[Osera seed]] from a [[Mouf]], [[Wyyyschokk/Legends|Webweaver]] silk, a [[Ranrt crystal]], and finally a [[Mysess blossom]]. Using all of these ingredients, he created a cure for the [[Tree/Legends|tree]], and rewarded the individual with the [[Blade of Nyenthi'Oris]] and 5,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Shortly thereafter he went back to fighting the Sayormi.\n\nOnce again, he called on the aid of an outsider, pleading for the individual to help by killing twenty Sayormi, [[Cyrans|Cyrans the Unfeeling]] and the [[Sayormi Queen]]. Unfortunately, this angered the [[Arena Champion|Village Champion]], [[Wirartu]], who thought only he was worthy of such a task. Wirartu challenged the outsider to a duel and lost in the arena (though his life was spared). The individual then returned to Kerritamba and was awarded the [[Champion's sword]] and an [[Arena Champion]] badge.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKerritamba was a non-playable character in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to the game's closure on [[December 15]], 2011. He was added in the [[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees|''Rage of the Wookiees'']] expansion pack in [[2005]]. It was possible for the player to not spare Wiratu's life, instead killing him. This forced Kerritamba to exile the player from the village, after which the player began doing quests for the [[Outcasts (Kashyyyk)|Outcasts]], which eventually led to Kerritamba's death. No official source ever set a [[Star Wars Legends|canonical]] outcome.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Rage of the Wookiees}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=content.jsp?page=Friday%20Feature:%20Kachirho|text=Friday Feature: Kachirho|archivedate=20051020035202}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=content.jsp?page=Friday%20Feature:%20Kkowir%20Forest|text=Friday Feature: Kkowir Forest|archivedate=20051020034844}}\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Squadrons Over Corellia|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Squadrons_Over_Corellia#Card_gallery|cardname=Cure the Great Tree}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Chief Kerritamba}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
