If we could capture Darth Vader, we'd have enough Imperials for a party.|General Tyr Taskeen, to Brenn Tantor and Beri Tulon, commenting on their defections|Star Wars: Force Commander}}\n'''Tyr Taskeen''' was a skilled [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[General/Legends|general]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Originally the owner of his own [[Starship/Legends|starship]] sales business, Taskeen was enraged when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] nationalized his company and [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] his [[Non-huMan|nonhuman]] employees. He joined the nascent Rebellion on his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] and quickly rose to the rank of general due to his skills in setting up and operating secret bases in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]].\n\nTaskeen was the commander of the Rebel forces on [[Abridon]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], where he convinced [[Brenn Tantor]], the Imperial general who had conquered his forces, to defect to the Rebel Alliance after Tantor was ordered to massacre a [[Abridon refugee camp|refugee camp]]. After Tantor's defection, Taskeen supervised him, overseeing such operations as the theft of an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|All Terrain Armored Transport]] and the reconquest of Abridon. Taskeen was also one of the Rebel generals present at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], liaising with Tantor yet again. That working relationship continued into the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], as Taskeen commanded the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|conquest of Coruscant]] with Tantor in control of tactical operations underneath him.\n\n==Biography==\n===Starship salesman to Rebel commander===\n{{Quote|If you betray the Rebel Alliance, the Empire will never get the chance to execute you.|Tyr Taskeen, to Brenn Tantor|Star Wars: Force Commander}}\n[[File:TyrTaskeen-ANH.jpg|thumb|left|Taskeen at the ceremony following the Battle of Yavin.]]\nTyr Taskeen, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Homeworld/Legends|native]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], never expected to become a military man. After completing his education, he began a career as a free-ranging independent [[Starship/Legends|starship]] dealer, selling advanced starships to [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceports]] and individuals, mostly in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. That business strategy helped him expand rapidly until he was running a large and very profitable company.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nHis world came crashing down when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] nationalized his company at some point before the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. Additionally, many of his [[Non-huMan|nonhuman]] employees were taken into [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]]. Furious, Taskeen returned to Alderaan, where he knew he would be able to find contacts who could help him join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]].<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nAlthough he lacked a military background, Taskeen had many other attributes that made him extremely useful to the Rebellion. His personal wealth, business experience, numerous contacts, and familiarity with the Outer Rim Territories put him in a position to build and manage several Rebel bases in the Rim.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nThese skills, and his success in using them, soon brought him to the attention of the Rebel leadership. He received promotion after promotion, until he gained the rank of [[General/Legends|general]]. While not a tactical genius, Taskeen was a skilled administrator, competent officer, and exceptionally dedicated to the cause.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nFollowing the Alliance's victory over the Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[battlestation]] at the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Taskeen was present at a ceremony in which [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] were awarded the [[Medal of Bravery/Legends|Medal of Bravery]] for their part in the battle.<ref name=\"Insider133\">{{InsiderCite|133|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery}}</ref>\n\n===The defection of Brenn Tantor===\n{{Quote|I'm going to give you a chance to fight for your beliefs.|Tyr Taskeen, to Brenn Tantor|Star Wars: Force Commander}}\n[[File:BrennDefects.jpg|thumb|right|Brenn contacts Tyr Taskeen to defect to the Rebel Alliance]]\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Taskeen commanded a Rebel force that [[Uprising on Abridon|captured]] [[Abridon]] in cooperation with the [[Abridon Nationalists]]. While initially a great victory for the Rebellion, the mission swiftly became a disaster. The Imperials [[Massacre on Abridon|counterattacked]] within [[Standard day/Legends|days]], devastating Rebel positions around the [[Abridon capital city|capital city]], retaking the [[Abridon Government Center|capitol]], and capturing several Rebel dignitaries sent to negotiate with the [[Abridon Government Council|Abridon government]], one of whom was [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] hero Luke Skywalker. Finally, the Imperial ground forces crushed the final Rebel base, with Taskeen unable to halt their reconquest. Taskeen, listening in on Imperial transmissions, heard [[Grand General/Legends|Grand General]] [[Malcor Brashin|Brashin]] issue the order to destroy a [[Abridon refugee camp|refugee camp]] filled with innocent civilians. General [[Brenn Tantor]], the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] who had so devastated Taskeen's forces, refused. Brashin exchanged harsh words with his subordinate and locked him out of command.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nTaskeen saw an opportunity, and he took it. He surreptitiously contacted Tantor, offering the Imperial general a comm frequency to contact him if Tantor was willing to consider defection. Shortly thereafter, Tantor contacted him with the information that he would be at [[Kalaan/Legends|Kalaan]] in two days.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nTaskeen rushed to Kalaan and set up a temporary base to await Tantor's defection, fully aware that it could be an Imperial trap. Nevertheless, it would have been irresponsible to let pass the opportunity to recruit such an exceptionally skilled and highly placed Imperial officer. Tantor [[Escape from Kalaan|escaped]] from [[Kalaan prison|Imperial custody]] on Kalaan and brought with him a fantastic series of bonuses: a [[Tracked Mobile Base]] command vehicle, [[Kalaan defectors|a squad]] of defecting [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], and most impressively of all, Luke Skywalker, who had also been incarcerated on Kalaan.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\n[[File:Taskeen_with_soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|Taskeen, flanked by soldiers, greets General Brenn Tantor upon his defection.]]\nTantor was brought to a Rebel [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]], where Taskeen met him in person for the first [[Time/Legends|time]]. To the defector's surprise, Taskeen's [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] immediately took him into custody. Taskeen allowed Tantor to squirm in the [[Prison/Legends|brig]] before finally going to meet with him. Taskeen questioned Tantor's usefulness, and the ex-Imperial offered to prove himself by capturing an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|All Terrain Armored Transport]]. Cautiously intrigued, Taskeen was willing to commit, but Tantor claimed that first he needed to rescue [[Beri Tulon]], an Imperial [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]] and Tantor's mentor, who had attempted to defect on Abridon. Now imprisoned on the planet [[Ruul (planet)|Ruul]], Tantor knew that he had knowledge of an AT-AT manufacturing facility. Still suspicious of Tantor's loyalty, but unwilling to pass up the opportunity to put such a powerful machine in the hands of Alliance technicians, Taskeen assented to Tantor's plan, but warned him that he would remain under Taskeen's watchful [[Eye/Legends|eye]].<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nTaskeen and Tantor set up an [[Mission to Ruul (Galactic Civil War)|ambush]] on the convoy carrying Tulon to the [[Tarkin Detention Facility]]. Tantor performed wonderfully both in the ambush and in a raid on a nearby Imperial [[Sounder Flats computer complex|computer complex]] that obtained the access codes to the [[Trasse Proving Grounds|walker manufacturing facility]] on [[Trasse/Legends|Trasse]]. Taskeen's suspicions were not yet allayed, but he was slowly gaining confidence in Tantor.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nNow supervising yet another ex-Imperial, Taskeen was pleased when Tantor and Tulon managed to [[Mission to Trasse|seize]] an AT-AT from Trasse without complications. However, he had no time to celebrate, as Grand General Brashin appeared in the [[Star system/Legends|system]] aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Inquisitor (Star Destroyer)|''Inquisitor'']]. Tantor was forced to rush to take control of a [[planetary ion cannon]] and successfully seized it and disabled the Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\n===Rebel victories===\n{{Quote|I won't lie to you, Brenn. This will be an uphill battle. Are you up for the job?|Tyr Taskeen|Star Wars: Force Commander}}\nWith the successful completion of the mission, Taskeen began to put more trust in Tantor. He placed the General in command of a [[Liberation of Abridon|mission]] to Abridon due to Tantor's experience with the Imperial positions there. There, Taskeen observed approvingly from the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate/Legends|Nebulon-B frigate]] [[Lucky Star (EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate)|''Lucky Star'']] as Tantor trounced the Imperial garrison he himself had installed and freed a [[Abridon holding camp|camp]] of prisoners, including [[Hamman Flatt]], the former [[lieutenant governor]] of Abridon. Flatt told Taskeen and Tantor that in gratitude, the Abridon Nationalists would make available several [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor/Legends|A-wings]] from the [[Abridon Shipyard|shipyards]] of [[Sayan]]. With knowledge of the upcoming [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Taskeen was eager to add to the Alliance's [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] complement. Tantor fought his way through the war-torn [[City/Legends|city]], and a [[Hover Transport TC9|Hover Transport]] full of [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] safely flew the A-wings to [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]], where the Rebel fleet was preparing to attack the [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II]].<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nTaskeen and Tantor then returned to the main Rebel force. Tyr Taskeen was one of four generals involved in planning, supervising, and executing the ground mission to destroy the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield projector]] on [[Endor/Legends|Endor]]. General [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]] was the primary planner, while Tantor, who had helped set up the shield bunker as an Imperial, oversaw the operation from the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class shuttle]] [[Tydirium/Legends|''Tydirium'']]. General Han Solo led the [[Commando/Legends|commando]] squad that actually destroyed the bunker. Taskeen supervised Tantor's performance and served as liaison with high command amidst the fleet battle.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nThe incredible victory at Endor resulted in the [[Death/Legends|deaths]] of [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], [[Supreme Commander (Empire)/Legends|Supreme Commander]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Nial Declann]], and many more important Imperials, throwing the Galactic Empire into chaos.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" /> As numerous [[Warlord/Legends|warlords]] broke away from the Empire, Admiral [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] dispatched the [[New Republic First Fleet|First Fleet]] under Admiral [[Firmus Nantz]] on a campaign in the [[Western Reaches/Legends|Western Reaches]]. Nantz drove the forces of the Imperial warlord Admiral [[Sander Delvardus]] from [[Glova]], while Taskeen led a ground [[Battle of Glova|attack]] with the assistance of [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] irregular [[Trooper/Legends|troops]]. Nantz's forces proceeded on to [[Glom Tho]], where Taskeen once more commanded a ground [[Battle of Glom Tho|operation]], overseeing the capture of several foundries.<ref name=\"EGW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref> However, the Empire was not destroyed. Over two more years of battle would be required before the Rebel Alliance, now the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], undertook the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|invasion]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], capital of the Empire.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\n===Capture of Coruscant===\n{{Quote|Welcome to the next chapter in the history of the galaxy.|Tyr Taskeen, to Dellis Tantor, about the fall of Coruscant|Star Wars: Force Commander}}\nTaskeen, in cooperation with the New Republic high command, directed General Tantor to land a force just small enough to avoid detection by Coruscant's advanced sensor net near the north pole. That force disabled the sensor nodes in that region and cleared the way for the New Republic to land a massive assault force undetected. Tantor next breached the defensive wall along the edge of the [[Water/Legends|ice]] cap and captured a series of vital Imperial facilities, including a [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]], repair bay, [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] platforms, and walker storage depots.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\n[[File:Force_Commander_finale.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tyr Taskeen, Brenn Tantor, and Dellis Tantor celebrate the liberation of Coruscant.]]\nRepublic forces pushed on to the final battleground: the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]] itself. Facing off against the ferocious Imperial defense, commanded by his old nemesis Grand General Brashin, Tantor pounded through layer after layer of Imperial [[Armor/Legends|armor]], weapons emplacements, and air support until a final infantry invasion secured the Imperial Palace. Throughout the entire battle, Taskeen continued his role as Tantor's supervisor, defining his overall strategic objectives.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nIt was then that Tantor discovered that his brother, [[Dellis Tantor|Dellis]], long thought dead at the hands of the Empire, had been held in a dungeon in the sublevels of the Palace. Taskeen was there to meet the brothers as they emerged from the Palace. Taskeen warmly congratulated his friend and welcomed Dellis to freedom. Looking out at the crowd celebrating the New Republic's victory, Taskeen anticipated a bright future.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Hardly red carpet treatment.''\"<br />\"''How did you expect us to treat an Imperial general?|Brenn Tantor and Tyr Taskeen, as Tantor is taken into custody|Star Wars: Force Commander}}\n[[File:Tyr_Taskeen.jpg|thumb|left|Tyr Taskeen, as a Rebel officer]]\nTyr Taskeen had [[Color/Legends|red-brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], brown [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and fair skin. Taskeen did not begin his career as a fiery freedom fighter but as a businessman. However, neither was he a cold-hearted [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]]-counter who joined the Rebellion simply because the Empire took his company from him. Taskeen was driven as much by principle as by revenge, though the two mingled in the Empire's enslavement of his nonhuman employees.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nTaskeen remained exceptionally devoted to the Rebellion, and later to the New Republic. He was extremely suspicious of Tantor for several missions, entrusting the former Imperial with barely enough mat\u00e9riel to accomplish his objectives, though he was pragmatic enough to accept Tantor's loyalty after the delivery of the AT-AT.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\nDespite being a general, Taskeen's primary talents were those of a businessman: administration and organization. During battles, he allowed Tantor to run the tactical show while he supervised and made sure overall objectives were met. Apparently these skills were enough to impress the Rebel and New Republic high command, as Taskeen was entrusted with vital roles in the battles of Endor and Coruscant.<ref name=\"Force Commander\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTyr Taskeen was created for the [[2000]] [[LucasArts]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Force Commander]]'', in which he was voiced by [[Michael Bell]].<ref name=\"Force Commander\" /> The [[June]] [[2012]] [[Star Wars Insider 133|''Star Wars Insider'' 133]] feature \"[[Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|''Rogues Gallery'']]\" by [[Leland Chee]] [[retcon]]ned Taskeen as one of the previously unidentified Rebels who stood behind [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] during the closing scene of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name=\"Insider133\" /><ref name=\"anh\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Tyr Taskeen}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Force Commander]]'' {{C|First appearance before retcon}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[The Star Wars Storybook]]'' {{Ret}}\n*[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (PhotoComic)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' PhotoComic]] {{Ret}}\n*''[[Star Wars Manga: A New Hope 4]]'' {{Ret}}\n*[[Empire 15|''Empire'' 15]] {{Ret}}\n*[[Chewbacca (2000) 3|''Chewbacca'' (2000) 3]] {{Flash}} {{Ret}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Force Commander: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]'' {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]'' {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Special Edition]]'' {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]'' {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*{{InsiderCite|133|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: Celebrating a Rebel Victory!}}\n*{{SWE|characters|r2d2|R2-D2}} {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*{{SWE|characters|lukeskywalker|Luke Skywalker}} {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SW|url=news/yavin-4-rebels-guardians-of-the-hidden-fortress|text=Yavin 4 Rebels: Guardians of the Hidden Fortress}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tyr Taskeen\n|es=Tyr Taskeen\n|nl=Tyr Taskeen\n|ru=\u0422\u0438\u0440 \u0422\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taskeen, Tyr}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance Army generals]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Army generals]]"}}}]}}}}
