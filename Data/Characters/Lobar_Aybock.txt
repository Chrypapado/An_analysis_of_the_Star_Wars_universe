During the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Aybock was captured by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces during the [[Bombing of K'avor|bombing]] of his [[City/Legends|hometown]] of [[K'avor]]. Deemed unworthy to be a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]], Aybock was put into the service of [[Zygerrian/Legends|Zygerrian]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]]. Shortly afterward, a [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] by the name of [[Eedund Cus]] purchased Aybock's freedom and trained him in the art of [[Shockboxing/Legends|shockboxing]], hoping to make a successful investment after seeing the natural fighter in him. With the help of Cus, his trainer, and [[Stitchy]], his [[Medic/Legends|medic]], Aybock went on to become a champion shockboxer. During the time of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], Aybock helped [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] overthrow the [[Reuss Corporation]]'s hold on the populace of [[Reuss VIII]] by fighting in a deadly match against the [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] [[Tull Raine]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLobar Aybock was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Calian]] born in [[K'avor]], a [[City/Legends|city]] on the [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Shiva IV]].<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" /><ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|caledre25|23|Endnotes For Fists Of Ion: Memoirs Of A Champion Shockboxer by Lobar Aybock, Chapter VII: Hard Raine|If There's A Bright Center To The Universe&hellip;|Edward M.

Imperial agents performed a variety of tests on Aybock, until they judged the Calians unfit to be [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. He was then handed off to [[Zygerrian/Legends|Zygerrian]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]]. [[Eedund Cus]], a [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]], eventually purchased Aybock's freedom, whereupon he trained him in [[Shockboxing/Legends|shockboxing]] and taught the Calian [[Aurebesh/Legends|Aurebesh]] and [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]].<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\n===Life as a shockboxer===\n{{Quote|I saw you IO Tontruk on Vycinyth in the second phase. They used to say nobody could beat an Esoomian.|Bren Derlin|Fists of Ion}}\n[[File:Aybock_runs.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Aybock running before a match]]\nWith the training of Eedund Cus, Aybock became a successful shockboxer, fighting in sixty-four bouts on a variety of worlds, in which he compiled a record of 58-6. As his [[Medic/Legends|medic]], Aybock took on an accomplished [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] named [[Stitchy]], former court physician to [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Apailana/Legends|Apailana]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]].<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" /><ref name=\"blog\" /> Traditionally, Aybock chose to stay at [[Hotel/Legends|hotels]] relatively close to his shockboxing matches, so that he could run to the arena to get pumped up before the fight, regardless of the weather. At one point during his career, he faced the [[Esoomian/Legends|Esoomian]] [[Tontruk]]<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" /> on the resort planet<ref name=\"LotE\">''[[Lords of the Expanse]]'' Sector Guide</ref> [[Vycinyth]], where he defeated his opponent in the second phase. The shield on Tontruk's [[Armor/Legends|armor]] dropped, allowing Aybock to land a hit with an ion-charged [[shockmitt]], ionizing Tontruk's armor and resulting in an ion-out.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\nSome time after the [[Declaration of a New Republic/Legends|formation]] of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] in [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]], Aybock agreed to a contract with the [[Reussi]] [[Torel Vorne]] and the [[Reuss Corporation]] over the biggest fight of his life, in which he would face off in a title match against the [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] shockboxer [[Tull Raine]] on the planet [[Reuss VIII]], in the [[Portmoak sector]]. Raine, although previously defeated in an amateur-level challenge, had since remained undefeated in title contests. Hidden within the discourse of Vorne's contract, a clause stated that if Aybock were to die in his fight, his body would become the property of the Reuss Corporation, and thereby the property of Torel Vorne. Prior to the duel, Vorne privately auctioned off Aybock's organs with the expectation that the boxer would die in the fight. Vorne sold off each piece of Aybock's body, with his [[Lung/Legends|lungs]] set to go to the [[Sector/Legends|sector's]] Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], [[Ammar]]. In order to further ensure Aybock's [[Death/Legends|death]], Vorne set up a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] who was to disable the shielding [[hub]] on Aybock's [[GolanGear]] armor during the middle of the shockboxing match.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\nUpon learning of the cadaver clause in Aybock's contract from [[Resik (Jillsarian)|Resik]], the [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] at the [[The Broken Tusk (Reuss VIII)|Broken Tusk]] where the fight was scheduled to take place, Eedund Cus insisted they leave the planet immediately. On their way out, Cus and Aybock planned to meet up with Stitchy, but the Gungan was, surprisingly, in a crowded [[speedervan]] with several other figures. Aybock and Cus boarded the speedervan, which was occupied by, amongst others, [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Bren Derlin/Legends|Bren Derlin]] of [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]].<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" /> Derlin, who had been with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]] since the [[Battle of Nentan]],<ref name=\"DB2\">{{DB|character|majorbrenderlin|Derlin, Major Bren|archivedate=20110517075217}}</ref> presented Aybock and his companions with intelligence about Torel Vorne's organ racketeering operation. As further incentive, Derlin and one of his companions, [[Mygo Skinto]], appealed to their sense of decency in helping the planet's desperate locals, often referred to as [[Rust Rats]]. Derlin pitched a plan to circumvent Vorne's slicing efforts by introducing their own slicer, [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Dansra Beezer]]. Furthermore, it would allow the New Republic to suspend the operations of the Reuss Corporation, which had laid waste to the planet's citizens and environment over the last twenty years. Aybock agreed to help Derlin, but only on the condition that the fight with Raine be a fair one, and that he be given no advantage by Beezer.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\n[[File:LobarAybock.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Raine vs. Aybock]]\nThe day of his match against Raine, Aybock ran to the [[Dool Arena]] at the Broken Tusk in his [[Aleemas]], a [[Roamer-6 breath mask|breath mask]], and an [[exposure suit]], while Rust Rats cheered him on. He fought through nine brutal phases against Tull Raine, unsure if the New Republic slicer would be successful against the sabotage efforts of Vorne. Then, teetering on the edge of his strength, Aybock was overcome with the ''[[ryastraad]]''&mdash;a battle madness famous of his people&mdash;when he heard the local Reussi chanting his name during the tenth and final phase. Buoyed by their support, Aybock sent Tull flying out of the shockboxing wedge with a crushing [[hub-buster]] to end the showdown. Afterward, Aybock donated the winner's purse to the Rust Rats to help with their relief effort.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nWhile originally born in the [[Shiva system]], Aybock moved to [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] subsequent to his Imperial captivity and later enslavement at the hands of the Zygerrians. Aybock held [[Ponderweight Division Shockboxing sash]]es for both the [[Mid Rim|Mid]] and [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]]. In [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], some time following his victory over Tull Raine at the Broken Tusk, Aybock published his autobiography, entitled ''[[Fists Of Ion: Memoirs Of A Champion Shockboxer]]''. One year later, [[zZip Product Concepts Limited]] endorsed Aybock by putting his name on a luxury [[Speeder truck/Legends|speeder]], the [[42-Aybock Ion]]. He continued to fight in shockboxing tournaments and was ranked the top contender in the [[Pangalactic Championship]] scheduled for [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]].<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" /> He finally retired in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]] and finishing with a record of 72-8.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Hell, all I've ever been able to deal with is what I can break at the end of my fists.|Lobar Aybock, in his autobiography|Fists of Ion}}\nGrowing up, Lobar Aybock was constantly surrounded by fighting and violence between the Calians and T'Syri\u00e9l native to his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], Shiva IV.<ref name=\"Marvel 53\" /> At some point in his life, the Empire bombed his hometown, captured Aybock, and subjected him to a multitude of tests, before turning him over to Zygerrian slavers with the degrading comment that he was unfit to be a stormtrooper. As a result of the strife Aybock faced, he felt that there was only one way to deal with life and the challenges it threw at him: through violence. Although he never had the opportunity to strike back at his tormentors, including the T'Syri\u00e9l, Imperials, and slavers, Aybock learned to take out his anger on fellow combatants in the sport of shockboxing. Members of the Calian race were known for their natural fighting skills, and Lobar Aybock's people had a word&mdash;''ryastraad''&mdash;for the extreme violence, or battle madness, that sometimes overcame them, such as during Aybock's fight against Raine.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\nFurthermore, when presented with the information that Torel Vorne and Raine were planning to rig the title match on Reuss VIII, Aybock insisted on having a fair fight, both ways, instead of having the slicer Sergeant Dansra Beezer fix the fight so that he would win. He was willing to put his life on the line for this fight, with no guarantee of safety from Beezer, in order to help Major Derlin's plan to overthrow the Reuss Corporation and aid the Rust Rats.<ref name=\"Fists of Ion\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLobar Aybock was created by \"[[What's The Story?]]\" author [[Edward M. Erdelac]] for his official ''[[Star Wars]]'' authorial debut in the [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]]-exclusive short story ''[[Fists of Ion]]''. The story of Aybock was inspired in part by [[Wikipedia:Rocky Balboa|Rocky Balboa]], and his name is in fact a [[tuckerization]] of [[Wikipedia:Sylvester Stallone|Sylvester Stallone's]] character from the [[1976]] boxing film [[Wikipedia:Rocky|''Rocky'']]. While most of the background story information for Aybock comes from 1990s ''Star Wars'' sources such as [[West End Games]]' ''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]'' and [[Wayne Humfleet]]'s original description of shockboxing in ''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'', Erdelac derived underlying motifs from the societal impact of the [[June 22]], [[1930s|1938]] rematch between [[Wikipedia:African American|African American]] [[Wikipedia:Joe Louis|Joe Louis]] and [[Wikipedia:Germany|German]] [[Wikipedia:Aryan|Aryan]] [[Wikipedia:Max Schmeling|Max Schmeling]]. In ''Fists of Ion'', Erdelac places Lobar Aybock on the side of Joe Louis, whereas the [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] Tull Raine takes Max Schmeling's role.<ref name=\"interview\">[[Lobar Aybock/interview|Interview with Edward M.
