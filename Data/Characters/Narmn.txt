He stood guard for the village and was present when [[Drua]]&mdash;a fellow villager&mdash;welcomed [[Darth Sidious]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and [[Erstin Deez]] to their village. The Twi'leks, however, were unaware of the trio's actual identities as [[Galactic Empire|Imperials]], and Sidious presented himself and Vader under pseudonyms in [[Sith tongue]] that meant \"[[death]]\" and \"fate,\" respectively. Unbeknown to Narmn or the rest of the villagers, the [[Sith]] [[Lord]]s were on a [[Mission to Ryloth|mission]] to quell the [[Free Ryloth Movement]], and soon they all witnessed a skirmish between the two factions. To leave no witnesses to the events that transpired, Sidious&mdash;the [[Galactic Emperor]]&mdash;commanded Vader to kill every last villager, which included Narmn.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lords of the Sith]]'' {{1st|[[Lords of the Sith (audiobook)|''Lords of the Sith'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Lords of the Sith (audiobook)|''Lords of the Sith'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30ca\u30fc\u30e0\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
