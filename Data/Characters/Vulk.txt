During his service to the Order, Vulk and two [[Je'daii Journeyer]]s were dispatched to [[Kalimahr]] to negotiate a dispute about mining rights to an asteroid in the [[Tython system/Legends|system]]. Meeting with [[Constable/Legends|Constable]] [[Lorus]] of the [[Kalimahr Militia]] in the street, Vulk dismissed Lorus' insistence that the Je'daii answer some questions he had by using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to lift the constable into the air and out of his path.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\nAcquainted with [[Je'daii Master]] [[Lanoree Brock's father|Brock]] and his [[Lanoree Brock's mother|wife]], the couple had a fond view of Vulk and his service to the system. Vulk was piloting a [[Cloud Chaser]] on Kalimahr when he was shot down during a firefight with [[Xang]] [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorists]] in [[25,801 BBY]]. Realizing he was doomed, Ranger Vulk piloted his ship into the [[Southern Ocean (Kalimahr)|Southern Ocean]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] in order to avoid causalities in the nearby city of [[Rhol Yan]]. Before the crash, Vulk had managed to neutralize fourteen of the Xang.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nVulk was a Je'daii who refused to allow anything get in his way of justice and what was right. During his interaction with a local constable, this unyielding energy was interpreted as an air of arrogant superiority. He was not afraid to dismiss bureaucracy that would slow him down, as Constable Lorus discovered when Vulk [[Telekinesis/Legends|lifted]] the [[Sith (species)/Legends|Sith]] officer out of his path.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]'' {{1stm|[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Vulk\n|ru=\u0412\u0443\u043b\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Je'daii Rangers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
