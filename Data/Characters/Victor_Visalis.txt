Childish.|A voter and Victor Visalis|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Victor Visalis''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served as the [[Officer of Defense]] for [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. During that [[Time/Legends|time]], he was involved in a [[Politics/Legends|political]] campaign against [[Director of Commerce]] [[Sean Trenwell]] for [[Mayor/Legends|Mayor]] of Bestine. Victor hired a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to help with his campaign by obtaining evidence to further his campaign. After winning the election, Victor contracted the spacer to find and [[Death/Legends|kill]] the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] executioner in an effort to halt a series of Tusken raids on Bestine.\n\n==Biography==\nSome time during [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Victor Visalis set up an office in the [[Bestine Capitol]] building. From here, Victor carried out his campaign to run for [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], with the help of his secretary [[Keanna Li'kyna]]. [[Spacer/Legends|Spacers]] who supported his campaign would gather evidence to support Victor's appointment to mayor, and submit their vote for him to [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Tour Aryon]]. One piece of evidence that a spacer found was proof that Victor donated one million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to the [[Lightwind Orphanage]]. Victor's primary campaign position was his emphasis on securing Bestine from [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] attacks. If elected, he promised to increase the number of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] patrols in Bestine, to keep its citizens safe. For this reason, he gained much support from Bestine's [[Imperial garrison (Bestine)|Imperial garrison]].\n\nThroughout 1 ABY, Victor Visalis would periodically win mayoral elections against [[Sean Trenwell]]. However, defeats were not uncommon either. He would reward all his voters with an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] Banner, or ''Loyalist Badge'' when he became mayor, and Imperial stormtrooper patrols would notably increase throughout the city. After one successful election, Victor tasked a spacer with a mission to eliminate a [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Executioner]], hidden in the caves beneath [[Fort Tusken/Legends|Fort Tusken]]. Upon returning the Tusken's head to Victor, the spacer was rewarded with a rare [[Lithitanium rifle]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVictor Visalis was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to the games closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]]. He was featured in the Bestine Political Election mini story-arc. Players had to run a short quest for him, before voting in his favor.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=content.jsp?page=Bestine%20Politics|text=Bestine Politics|archivedate=20040316050620}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Visalis, Victor}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
