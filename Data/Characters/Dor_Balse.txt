He was also a member of [[The Cell]], a criminal faction wanting to oust and replace local crimelord [[Nirama]]. He wasn't very highly placed in the Cell, neither was the Darkside faction in the general Cell scheme.<ref name=\"MW\">''[[MidWorld]]''</ref>\n\nBalse was one of the few remaining members of the Darkside contingent after a raid committed by [[Nirama]]'s forces in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]. Other survivors included [[Ahlya]], [[Kruss Gaal]], [[Jarrilyn]], [[Jasper]] and [[Michael (Darkside)|Michael]]. At that point, they were trying to recruit new members, including local [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]], [[Kaarl]] the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] and some newcomers, but the people in Darkside felt no respect for the local Cell. Shortly thereafter, they were captured by a group of spies working for Nirama.<ref name=\"MW\" />\n\nHis implication in The Cell and subsequent capture were public knowledge less than one month later.<ref name=\"UW\">''[[UnderWorld]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[MidWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[UnderWorld]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Balse, Dor}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
