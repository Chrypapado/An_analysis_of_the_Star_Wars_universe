Terlyn was [[Marriage/Legends|married]] to a [[Terlyn's husband|man]], with whom she had two children. Terlyn's husband was a [[Onderon Royalist|royalist]] member of the [[Council of Lords]], and attempted to assassinate [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]]. After his death, Terlyn and her children stayed in the Merchant Quarter, where they received a starport visa from Meetra Surik and left the planet.\n\n==Biography==\nTerlyn lived on Onderon, a Inner rim planet within [[The galaxy/Legends|the Galaxy]]. Terlyn was married to a member of the Council of Lords who supported [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]] during the [[Onderon Civil War]]. She was also the [[Parent/Legends|parent]] to a [[Terlyn's son|son]] and a [[Terlyn's daughter|daughter]] and lived together with them in [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of Onderon. Prior to Meetra Surik's [[Mission to Onderon (Old Sith Wars)|mission to Onderon]], Terlyn's husband attempted to assassinate [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]], but was [[Death|killed]] in the process. After her husband's death, Terlyn hoped to leave Onderon with her children. However, due to the ongoing unrest, she was unable to acquire a [[starport visa]]. Terlyn approached [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] who passed through the [[Merchant Quarter]] of Iziz, hoping to find one who had a spare open starport visa.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nWhen attempting to visit Onderon, the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|Exile]] Meetra Surik was fired on by Vaklu's forces and crashed on [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], one of Onderon's [[Moon/Legends|moons]]. Hoping to meet [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kavar]], Surik gained the assistance of the [[Mandalorians (Clan Ordo)|Mandalorians]], and arrived in Iziz with [[Canderous Ordo|Mandalore the Preserver]]. When Surik passed through the Merchant Quarter, she met Terlyn. Terlyn explained her plight to Surik, who agreed to help. During her time on the planet, Surik came into possession of a open starport visa, and gifted it to Terlyn. After profusely thanking Surik, Terlyn left Iziz with her children.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTerlyn appeared in the [[2004]]<ref name=\"KOTOR II Date\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sit|title=''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - Rise of the Sith Lords''|work=Gamespot|archivedate=20180107021022}}</ref> [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'',<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" /> developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]].<ref name=\"KOTOR II Date\" /> The game was a sequel to the [[2003]]<ref name=\"KOTOR I Date\">{{SW|url=news/kotor-galaxy-of-heroes|text=BioWare and Capital Games on Bringing ''KotOR'' Fan Favorites into ''Galaxy of Heroes''}}</ref> [[Video game|game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'',<ref name= \"KOTOR\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''</ref> developed by [[BioWare]].<ref name=\"BioWare\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic|publisher=IGN|archivedate=20200205212954}}</ref>\n\nThe Exile can tell Terlyn to get out of her way when they first meet, resulting in [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points. However, if talked to again, Terlyn will still beg for a starport visa. If she is not given a visa by the time he Exile meets Kavar and leaves Onderon, she does not receive one. On the Exile's return to Onderon, Terlyn does not appear.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Onderon Royalists]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
