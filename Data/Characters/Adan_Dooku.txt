And she and my uncle did not get along. So we went into self-exile here.|Bail Organa and Adan Dooku|Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1}}\n'''Adan Dooku''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who served as [[Count/Legends|count]] of [[House Dooku]]. When [[Dooku's brother|his father]] died, Adan was too young to become Count so [[Kostanza Dooku|his mother]] became the [[Regent/Legends|regent]] of the House Dooku. This position was short-lived; Adan's uncle, the former [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], claimed the title, and he and his mother were forced into self-exile on the planet [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. He lived for many years on the planet, even becoming a good friend of [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]], and returned to [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno]] in order to claim his hereditary title only when his uncle was [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|killed]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Later, Adan had a son named [[Bron Dooku|Bron]] before widowed from his wife [[Maite Dooku|Maite]]. However, Dooku's appointment as the Count of Serenno conflicted with the interests of rival families, such as the [[House Borgin/Legends|House Borgin]]; Adan would eventually be murdered on Alderaan by [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] agent [[Jahan Cross]] under the orders of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], who worked in the interest of [[Rodas Borgin]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Exile from Serenno===\n{{Quote|Your planet has had a long history of resisting the authority&mdash;backed by the considerable wealth and influence of the Count of Serenno.''\"<br />\"''And paid the price for it, especially following the Clone Wars. Only the fact that I was raised away from Serenno, here, for most of my youth let my family retain the hereditary title.|Bail Organa and Adan Dooku|Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1}}\nAdan Dooku was born into the [[House Dooku]], a powerful and influential family on the planet [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno]]. Dooku was next in line to be the [[Count/Legends|Count]] following his [[Dooku's brother|father]]; however, when Dooku's father passed away, he was still too young to inherit the title. Thus, Dooku's [[Kostanza Dooku|mother]] opted to hold to position of [[Regent/Legends|regent]] in the absence of a proper male Count. This was disrupted by the return of her brother-in-law, a fallen [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] now known as the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] [[Dooku/Legends|Darth Tyranus]], to Serenno. Dooku sought the title for himself, which led to the exile of Adan and his mother to the planet [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], where they were taken in by the [[House of Organa/Legends|House of Organa]].\n\nAs Serenno was now in line with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Dooku remained on Alderaan through the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] until [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], becoming friends with [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]]. After Dooku's uncle was [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|killed]] by the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], during the final stages of the Clone Wars, Dooku returned to Serenno to claim the vacant title of Count, much to the disdain of the other Serenno houses, who saw no value in a Count that was raised on another planet.<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n\n===The Cleansing of Serenno===\n{{Quote|Lord Vader! This is barbaric! You never spoke of this!''\"<br />\"''The rest of the Galaxy suffered, so now will Serenno. The houses will be cleansed by blood.|Adan Dooku and Darth Vader|Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 2}}\n[[File:Cleansing_of_Serenno.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dooku witnessed the cleansing of Serenno ordered by Darth Vader.]]\nShortly after the Clone Wars ended and Dooku returned to his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], however, the servant of the new [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]], [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader arrived with a compliment of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. Vader had previously discussed the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] role with Serenno, but had not told the young Count of his true intentions. Vader declared that since all of the other great houses had allied themselves with the deceased Dooku, they must [[Cleansing of Serenno|purge]] the traitors in their midst by executing the current heads of every house. Dooku vehemently protested, but could do nothing as Vader revealed the final part of the deal&mdash;the sons must kill their own fathers, in order to ascend, and if anyone resisted, all of them would be killed. [[Rodas Borgin]] was the first to act, stabbing his own father in the back. As Dooku watched in horror, the rest of the sons followed suit, massacring the assembled nobles. Afterward, the lot of them were forced to kneel in their parents' blood and swear fealty to Lord Vader and the Empire.\n\nIn time, Dooku bore an heir, [[Bron Dooku]], with his wife, [[Maite Dooku|Maite]].<ref name=\"AOTE\">''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]''</ref>\n\n===Assassination on Alderaan===\n{{Quote|Bron! Get down!\"<br />\"Let me go! My father's hurt!\"<br />\"Your father's dead, Bron.|Bail Organa and Bron Dooku|Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1}}\nEventually, Dooku was branded as a target for [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] by an individual within the Imperial hierarchy, in cooperation with Borgin of [[House Borgin]]. Imperial agent [[Jahan Cross]] was sent to complete the job. Around [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], Dooku attended the [[25th anniversary of the settling of the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention|twenty-fifth anniversary]] of the [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention]] in [[Aldera/Legends|Aldera]]. Cross, a native of Alderaan, used this opportunity to his advantage, attending the celebration under the guise of reacquainting with [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]], who was also a close friend of Dooku's. During the event, Organa found some time to speak to Dooku in solitude, attempting to persuade the Count to join the growing [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|insurrection]] against the Galactic Empire. Organa believed the Count had great influence, despite the second guesses of the Count himself due to his upbringing on Alderaan and the conflict his origins had caused with the other Houses of Serenno.<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n\n[[File:Assassinationofadandooku.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The assassination of Adan]]\nMeanwhile, Cross, donning a fake suit of [[Mandalorian armor/Legends|Mandalorian armor]] created by [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] to impersonate [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], positioned himself on an adjacent rooftop with a [[Sniper rifle/Legends|sniper rifle]] and took aim at the Count through one of the room's windows. [[Candra Tymon]]&mdash;the head of Dooku's private security force&mdash;whom had been ordered outside while Organa presented his plea of rebellion, saw the laser sight on the rifle and attempted to warn Dooku, but she was too late. The shot hit Dooku directly in the heart after narrowly passing Tymon's right shoulder and breaching the room's window. Dooku's young son, Bron, witnessed the murder, as he had been awoken by the arguing between his father and Organa. Tymon pursued Dooku's assailant across the rooftops, ordering emergency medics to his room as she exchanged fire with the faux Mandalorian. Cross managed to flee, disposing of the Mandalorian armor in a local pond, where it dissolved, effectively eliminating any evidence of the perpetrator.<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nAfter his sudden murder, Dooku's son, Bron, was appointed as the new Count of Serenno. However, as he was too young to fulfill his duty, a regent was to be put in place. The Galactic Empire continued to work in the interest of the House Borgin to ensure Rodas Borgin's appointment as the temporary ruler.<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nCount Dooku believed himself to have minimal influence; however, his friends in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], including Bail Organa, saw his worth as a powerful and influential potential ally. Dooku was neutral to pro Imperial rule during [[Rise of the Empire era|his time]] as Count; he continually rejected his peers' notion of rebellion against [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] growing influence, despite making himself out to be what Bail Organa deemed a coward.<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAdan Dooku first appeared in the second story arc of [[Star Wars: Agent of the Empire\u2014Iron Eclipse|''Agent of the Empire'']], [[Star Wars: Agent of the Empire\u2014Hard Targets|''Hard Targets'']], in [[2012]]. The series, which stars suave Imperial agent Jahan Cross, is modeled after the [[Wikipedia: James Bond|''James Bond'']] franchise, containing many of the tropes featured throughout that franchise's twenty-three films. [[Christopher Lee]], who portrayed Adan's uncle in the ''Star Wars'' [[prequel trilogy]], portrayed the titular character in the Bond film [[Wikipedia:The Man With the Golden Gun (film)|''The Man With the Golden Gun'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Adan Dooku}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 2]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 4]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Count of Serenno/Legends|Count of Serenno]]<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n|years=&mdash;[[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]]<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n|before=[[Dooku/Legends|Count Dooku]]<ref name=\"AOTE\" />\n|before-years=\n|after=[[Orom Malvern]]<ref name=\"AOTE10:HT5\">''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 5]]''</ref>\n|after-years=3 BBY&mdash;<ref name=\"AOTE10:HT5\" />\n}}\n{{End_box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Adan Dooku\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dooku, Adan}}\n[[Category:House of Dooku]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Serennian]]"}}}]}}}}
