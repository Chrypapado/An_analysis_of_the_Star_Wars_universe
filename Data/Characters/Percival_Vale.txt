In about [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], Vale was sent by his father to the [[Cularin system]], where his father intended for him to enroll at the [[Almas Academy]] and train to become a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. However, Vale instead entered a relationship with [[Selima DeWitt]] and along with the [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] [[Higgie Sethven]], they established the shop [[Natural]] on [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]]. About a year after his arrival in the system, Natural became the site of a battle between two security teams, sent by the rival companies [[Culpharm]] and [[Genasys]]. While Sethven and DeWitt sheltered upstairs in the shop, Vale waited on the ground floor with a stick, in an attempt to defend them. However, all three were eventually rescued by the [[Heroes of Cularin]]. A few weeks later, Vale and DeWitt became engaged.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Find the Lady]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vale, Percival}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
