However, a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Empire's Wrath|apprentice]] of [[Darth Baras]] managed to get inside and sabotaged the generator to force it into the backup mode&mdash;cutting off any excess power drains, thereby deactivating the Organa force field.\n\nAfter the Warrior sabotaged the planetary generator and killed numerous [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], Kan'grell, along with Blenks, Organa and Prinn, confronted the Wrath. Organa decided to make an offer to the Sith, which he refused. The Sith, who was looking for information about Organa's former handmaiden Jaesa Willsaam, started to torture Blenks, who was Organa's lover. Refusing to watch Blenks [[Death/Legends|die]], Organa revealed that the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Jaesa Willsaam]]'s [[Parent/Legends|parents]] were still servants at [[Castle Organa]]. After getting the information on Willsaam's parents, the Wrath executed Organa and her bodyguards, including Kan'grell, for defying the Empire.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:House Organa military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
