We're going right back up.|Goll|Lords of the Sith}}\n'''Goll''' was a [[Twi'lek]] [[Gender|male]] who served in the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] during the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. He helped [[Mission to Ryloth|hunt down]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] when the movement destroyed the [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Perilous]]'' and shot their shuttle down. Goll and his squad were with [[Cham Syndulla]], [[Isval]] and [[Kallon]] when they discovered the body of [[Nordon]] who had tried to kill the two [[Sith Lord]]s and failed. They were then attacked by [[Gutkurr]]s and had to get picked up by [[Faylin]] on his ship. They then continued to track their targets until they found them down in a village in a canyon. They attacked the place but soon found themselves under attack by [[V-wing]]s. Everyone else died, except for Goll, Cham, and Faylin, who escaped.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nFollowing this [[Mission to Ryloth|defeat]], Goll left the Free Ryloth movement, but remained in service of his planet. One year later in [[13 BBY]], Goll purchased a shipment of [[gattis-root]] extract from the [[Karthakk Group]] to give to the Twi'lek elders on Ryloth, because the Empire had rationed the supply of gattis-root extract in order to ferret out fugitive Free Ryloth insurgents. He was accompanied by \"Clinician\" [[Trae Baratha]] of the Karthakk Group who was there to collect the money after the delivery, [[Hera Syndulla]] whom he had convinced despite her differences with her father Cham and the crew of the [[YT-209 freighter|YT-209]] [[freighter]] [[Eclipse (freighter)|''Eclipse'']]: [[Captain]] [[Krysiant Rheden]], the [[Nikto]] [[gunner]] [[Ul'ligan]] and the [[Sephi]] gunner [[Eira Tay]]. Upon entering the Ryloth system, their ship, which is posing as the freighter [[Eclipse (freighter)|''Tirion'']], is scanned by an Imperial cruiser and cleared for entry. Three Imperial [[V-wing]]s intercept the ''Eclipse'' but the rebels shoot down the enemy starfighters following a brief dogfight, despite being damaged in the process. Goll makes contact with [[Dianthy]], who is supposed to pick up the delivery in [[Lessu]]. Approaching the capital, Hera lands the ''Eclipse'' in an abandoned commercial landing zone to the city situated beyond the viewing range of the Imperial monitoring stations. There, the rebels deliver their supplies and complete their repairs. Before the Empire can catch up to them, the crew jumps to hyperspace and makes for [[Manda]], where they will be dropped off. Goll compliments Hera for her leadership skills, which she showed after the ''Eclipse''{{'s}} captain was wounded in the dogfight.<ref name=\"MM\">''[[Mercy Mission (short story)]]''</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lords of the Sith]]'' {{1st|[[Lords of the Sith (audiobook)|''Lords of the Sith'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Lords of the Sith (audiobook)|''Lords of the Sith'' audiobook]]\n*{{Shortstory|story=Mercy Mission (short story)|sformatted=Mercy Mission|book=The Rise of the Empire}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30b4\u30eb\n}}\n\n[[Category:Free Ryloth movement members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
