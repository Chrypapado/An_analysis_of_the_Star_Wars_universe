He worked as a street sweeper, which he claimed let him know what was going on without being noticed. He also sometimes worked as hired muscle for [[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub]], paying visits to those who tried to manipulate the corporation. It was said that he didn't leave bruises.\n\nJuuus claimed that he used to be a pilot, but left that career after an accident nearly killed him (though nothing of this has been confirmed and Juuus is not a reliable source). As of [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], he was often seen wandering around Edic Bar talking to himself.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:SoroSuub Corporation employees]]\n[[Category:Trandoshans]]"}}}]}}}}
