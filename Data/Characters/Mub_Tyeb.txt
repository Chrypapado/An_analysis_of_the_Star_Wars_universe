He was also an informer for the [[Cularin Militia]] and provide them with information on these systems. When the Thaereians withdrew all their forces on Cularin to Soboll, Tyeb went into hiding in house. The [[Heroes of Cularin]], who were working for the Militia, visited him and asked him to give them any information he had about the location of the Thaereian commander in Soboll, [[Kurth San]], who they planned to capture. He told them that San was in [[Soboll Command Center|his command center]], which was heavily guarded. However, Tyeb had created the security systems there and he offered to create a hole in them so that the heroes could enter the base undetected. The heroes set out to infiltrate the base and Tyeb remained in his house and used a computer to activate the holes he had programmed into the security systems.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lockdown on Soboll]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Tyeb, Mub}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sullustans]]"}}}]}}}}
