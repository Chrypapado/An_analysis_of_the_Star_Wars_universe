Even if he owned the starship ''[[Merasy]]'', a [[Nova-Drive]] [[3-Z light freighter]], he performed no maintenance and was unable to stop an acceleration vibration on it.\n\nTumu tried to obtain money through smuggling, but he has little talent for it either. Tumu was arrested in [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] and his ship was impounded. The Brentaalan authorities wanted to auction it, but Tumu's work had been so bad that the mechanics had to overhaul the ship before selling it.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Stock Ships]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tumu, Iep}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
