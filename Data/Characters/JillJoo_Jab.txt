While in the [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] cantina, she encountered a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] willing to help her with her mission. JillJoo learned that a Twi'lek slave named [[Sadelli]] escaped before being shipped off to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. She tasked the spacer with finding her and bringing her back to Mos Espa, so that she could be sent safely off world. JillJoo encouraged the spacer by offering [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] for successfully carrying out her tasks. The space agreed, and went out to find Sadellli. Though the spacer was ambushed by two thugs, they were dispatched, and the escaped slave was safely brought back to the [[City/Legends|city]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nHowever, Sadelli would not leave Tatooine without her younger sister, [[Soolami]]. JillJoo informed the spacer who had helped her before that [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] wanted Soolami at his side. She also learned that the gang of slavers responsible for all this activity was led by an individual named [[Woff B'tar]], who she described as a horrible man. The spacer agreed to once again help JillJoo, and sought out to find Soolami. Once again, the spacer was attacked, this time by a thug and a [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] slaver. Fortunately, Soolami was brought back to Mos Espa, so that both she and her sister could leave the [[Planet/Legends|planet]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nHowever, JillJoo had one final task for the spacer. She managed to find the whereabouts of the slaver Woff B'tar. He was traveling to [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] to explain the shortage of slaves caused by the spacer's actions. She told the spacer that if he could intercept and \"convince\" Woff that the slaving business was not tolerated, she would be forever in the spacer's debt. Fortunately for her, and perhaps the spacer, the spacer agreed to find and kill Woff. JillJoo was happy to hear this, but warned the spacer that killing Woff and his gang could attract the attention of the local authorities. She suggest that the spacer leave immediately after carrying out the task. Fortunately for JillJoo, the spacer once again failed to let her down. The spacer managed to kill B'tar, the Trandoshan, and two cronies who were escorting him. When the spacer returned, JillJoo was quite thankful, and claimed that [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] needed more heroes like the spacer who had helped her. Though she gave yet another, greater reward for the spacer's efforts, she admitted that it was not much, because the slave liberation was only funded by the donations of concerned citizens.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJillJoo Jab first appeared in the comic \"[[Nerf Herder]]\". However, she later appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. In the game, players may perform a series of quests for her which involve rescuing Sadelli, and her sister Soolami, and killing the slavemaster named Woff B'tar.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|7|Nerf Herder}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided Quick Reference Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=JillJoo Jab\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jab, Jilljoo}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]\n[[Category:Waiters]]"}}}]}}}}
