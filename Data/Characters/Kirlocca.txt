He eventually became a teacher at the Academy, training countless students.\n\nAround [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Kirlocca and the Almas Jedi faced a series of challenges as a result of the rising power of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] in the [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] [[Star system/Legends|system]] brought about by the emegence of the [[Believers]], a powerful [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]]. While Kirlocca was leading a Jedi camping trip into the desolate [[Almas Wasteland]], several Jedi accompany the expedition fell to the dark side. They turned on the Wookiee and the rest of their party, and Kirlocca barely escaped with his life. Kirlocca later recovered the [[Pulas]], an ancient [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] from a [[Almas Sith fortress|Sith fortress]] on Almas, and he assisted with an effort to transport the relic to the [[Jedi Temple]] on the planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], to keep it out of the hands of the Believers.

As ''The New Essential Chronology'' places the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Kirlocca's arrival at the Academy can therefore be dated to circa [[56 BBY]].</ref> while at an age at which he was still considered young by Wookiee standards, Kirlocca ventured to the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]] [[Jedi academy|institution]] situated on the planet [[Almas]] in the [[Cularin system]], to enlist into the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].

After the Jedi student [[Raik Muun]] developed a romantic interest in Lawsirk and attempted to ignite a relationship with him, counter to doctrines of the Jedi Order, Kirlocca judged that Muun was unsuited to the rigors of Jedi life and dismissed her from the Academy.

Sensing a [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|disturbance in the Force]], Kirlocca and Lanius Qel-Bertuk rallied together a relief team and ventured to Tilnes to assist with rescuing inhabitants of the moon who had been affected by the quakes. As the two Jedi Masters traversed the rocky surface of Tilnes, they encountered the rogue [[Thaereian]] [[Officer/Legends|officer]] [[Osten Dal'Nay]] and the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a band of freelance agents who had been investigating the source of the quakes, just as they emerged from the mouth of a [[Cave/Legends|cave]] under fire from Thaereian pursuers. Kirlocca aided the freelancers in combating the Thaerians and helped Dal'Nay to escape his attackers. Qel-Bertuk placed Dal'Nay under the protection of the Jedi and the renegade officer went on to found the [[Cularin Militia]], a loyalist military force that opposed the Thaereian military's presence in the Cularin system.<ref name=\"Tilnes Rising\">''[[Tilnes Rising]]''</ref>\n\nKirlocca later led a group of several Jedi Masters, Knights and Padawans on a camping trip into the [[Almas Wasteland]], an inhospitable [[Desert/Legends|desert]] region of the moon, to teach them in advanced survival training. As the Jedi settled in for a night in the desert, the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] Knight [[Syr Tal-Soten]] arrived at their camp from a patrol bearing unexplained wounds and Kirlocca had the other Jedi tend to his injuries. Mid-treatment, Tal-Soten became overcame by a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] presence emanating from a [[Almas Sith fortress|Sith fortress]] situated at the center of the Wasteland,<ref name=\"Desert Cries\" /> which had recently been occupied by the [[Believers]]<ref name=\"A Dark Fortress\">''[[A Dark Fortress]]''</ref><ref name=\"The Believers\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050915believers|text=The Sith Fortress|int=The Sith Fortress|archivedate=20090603045740}}</ref> [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]].<ref name=\"Caaried Away\">''[[Caaried Away]]''</ref> The Ithorian denounced Kirlocca and claimed to have had a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] that Kirlocca would betray the Almas Academy and the Jedi Order, then [[Skirmish in the Almas Wasteland|attacked]] the Wookiee Jedi Master.

Vols [[Death/Legends|sacrificed]] himself and held the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|fallen Jedi]] attackers at bay while Kirlocca and the other unafflicted Jedi fled over the edge of a cliff. Kirlocca and his party then took flight across the desert, with their attackers giving chase<ref name=\"Desert Cries\" />\n\nFollowing an [[Bombing of Remembrance Hall|attack]] on the [[Museum/Legends|museum]] [[Remembrance Hall]] by the Believers, Lanius Qel-Bertuk recalled all Jedi in the Cularin system to the Almas Academy. When Kirlocca and his expedition did not respond, Qel-Bertuk became concerned for their well-being and sent out several search parties to look for them. The fallen Jedi eventually caught up with Kirlocca and the Wookiee sent Padawan Quor-Din to hide while he made a final stand against their attackers in a clearing at the base of a cliff. Standing among the bodies of several fallen comrades, Kirlocca wielded two lightsabers in frantic combat against Tal-Soten and the Jedi [[Trevon Rey]] and [[Seeth'tal]]. The Wookiee fought defensively and attempted to avoid harming his former colleagues while staying alive. The Heroes of Cularin, who had joined in Qel-Bertuk's search effort, found Kirlocca's roar and came to his aid. With help from the agents, the fallen Jedi were eventually subdued. Weary from his ordeal, Kirlocca collapsed from exhaustion and extracted by the Jedi back to the Almas Academy to rest.<ref name=\"Desert Cries\" />\n\n[[File:The_Call_of_the_Cult_DaL.png|thumb|right|200px|The Almas Sith fortress, where Kirlocca discovered the Pulas]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the affliction of Kirlocca's camping class, the Jedi [[Battle of the Sith Fortress|drove]] the Believers from the Sith fortress and placed the citadel under guard.<ref name=\"A Dark Fortress\" /> The Wookiee led a team of Jedi researchers on an expedition into the depths of the fortress and there they uncovered the [[Pulas]], a powerful [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] that had not been seen since the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Ruusan campaign]]<ref name=\"Coruscani Dawn\">''[[Coruscani Dawn]]''</ref> during the [[New Sith Wars]].<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> On their return journey to the Almas Academy, the Jedi were attacked by Believers and successfully fended off the cultists, preventing them from stealing the artifact. During the first [[Standard day/Legends|night]] that the Pulas was held in the Academy, the Believers staged a second unsuccessful attempt to seize the relic, which prompted Lanius Qel-Bertuk to make arrangements for the artifact to be transported to the [[Jedi Temple]] on the planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], for safekeeping. To prevent the theft of the relic en-route to Coruscant, the Jedi hired a [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] of 250 starships and placed a [[Mandalorian iron]] on each vessel, with one box containing the Pulas and the others acting as decoys. Kirlocca assisted with overseeing the loading of the boxes and aided by the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Administrator/Legends|administrator]] [[E1-6RA]], he handed over the boxes to starship crews from a [[Hoversled/Legends|repulsorsled]] on the outskirts of the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Forard]], near to the Academy, where the starships had been docked. When the Heroes of Cularin&mdash;who were also assisting in the transportation effort&mdash;arrived at their ship to take-off from the Academy, Kirlocca greeted them and handed them their allocate [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Iron/Legends|iron]] box, then left to assign out the rest of the boxes. The undertaking was ultimately a success and the Pulas was safely hauled to the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Coruscani Dawn\" />\n\nNot long after the shipping of the Pulas off of Almas, Lanius Qel-Bertuk agreed to a request from a [[Unidentified reporter|reporter]] to be interviewed regarding the recent emergence of the Believers. Kirlocca offered to meet with the reporter as well and the Jedi hostd an audience with the reporter in Qel-Bertuk's personal chambers at the Almas Academy. During the meeting, with a [[Translator droid/Legends|translator droid]] present to speak to the journalist on his behalf, Kirlocca discussed the level of threat posed the inhabitants of the Cularin system by the Believers and highlighted the recent success of the mission to Coruscant.<ref name=\"Further Discussions\" />\n\n===Confronting the t'salak===\n{{Quote|She had a great gift for manipulating the Force, but her control of her emotions and desires wasn't equal to the challenge of being a Jedi.

Qel-Bertuk sensed a disturbance in the Force within the system, which he and Kirlocca discussed on several occasions. Kirlocca was uncertain how the disturbance would be resolved; he continued to meditate in search of a greater understanding of what could have caused it and wrote in his personal logs about his concerns. Kirlocca sensed pain emanating from the settlements of the [[Tarasin]] people on Cularin, a [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] [[Species/Legends|species]] native to the world and believed that the dark side of the Force was going in strength among the students of the Almas Academy.

The Almas Jedi sought to study the creature in order to seek a way to destroy or permanently contain the creature. [[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]] [[Morad'Ka]], the matriarch of the Jaraana, agreed to let the Jedi take the t'salak and Kirlocca dispatched his former student, Nek Lawsirk to collect the creature. Unbeknownst to Kirlocca, Raik Muun, now a Dark Jedi, had returned to the Cularin system and she captured Lawsirk and collected the t'salak herself. Muun disguised herself as Lawsirk and over the next few [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] staged several attacked and extortion attempts against inhabitants of Cularin in an attempt to discredit the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" />\n\nKirlocca received word of the attacks and was sent a recording by the [[Office of Peace and Security]], a local security agency, of Muun intimidating the inhabitants of a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] while in disguise as Lawsirk. Kirlocca was concerned by Lawsirk's supposed actions and suspected that the t'salak was behind the Jedi Knight's fall to madness. The Wookiee sent a [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] to summon the Heroes of Cularin to a [[Jedi Enclave (Cularin)|Jedi enclave]] on Cularin and, speaking via a [[Holoprojector/Legends|holoprojector]] he tasked the freelance agents with finding Lawsirk and the t'salak. The Heroes of Cularin were unable to recover the creature but learned that Muun had been impersonating Lawsirk and freed a team of [[Biologist/Legends|biologists]] that she had imprisioned. The agents returned to the Jedi enclave and provided Kirlocca a report on the outcome of their mission. Kirlocca was deeply concerned by the revelation of Muun's return and request to call on the agents' services again once the Jedi had tracked her down.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" />\n\nA short time later, the pacific organization [[Sentient Beings Opposing Violence]] convened a conference in the Cularin system to discuss traditions of the Jedi Order that the SBOV regarded as controversial, such as Jedi recruitment policies. The meeting was held about the liner ''[[Luxury]]'' in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] of Cularin's [[Volcano/Legends|molten]] moon [[Rennokk]] and Kirlocca and a Jedi delegation attended the conference to represent the Order in the talks. Raik Muun plotted to disrupt the event and schemed to use the [[Force power/Legends|powers]] of the t'salaks to enrage the Jedi attending the conference into attacking Sentient Beings Opposing Violence, then used a recording of the attack to discredit the Jedi Order. Muun [[Battle of the Luxury|released]] several t'salaks aboard the ''Luxury'' and Kirlocca and two [[Jedi Consular]] Padawans stepped in to defend the over delegates from the creatures. The t'salaks used their Force abilities to enrage the SBOV delegates into turning on Jedi. Kirlocca and the Padawans struggled to keep the t'salaks and their maddened victims at bay and fought a long and furious battle against the creatures.<ref name=\"Force Convention\" />\n\nKirlocca suffered numerous wounds and drew heavily on the Force to sustain himself but was wearied by the prolonged fight. Having lost contact with the ''Luxury'', Lanius Qel-Bertuk dispatched the Heroes of the Cularin to the vessel.
