He was the lead man of a secret triumvirate comprised of himself, [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Imperial Guardsman]] [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Grodin Tierce]] and a con-artist named [[Flim]]. The regime was assembled in order to bring the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] into an internal civil war over the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan's]] involvement concerning the [[Caamas Document]] in order to keep the [[Supreme Commander (Empire)/Legends|Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet]], then-[[Fleet Admiral/Legends|Fleet Admiral]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]], from successfully making peace with the New Republic. Previously, Disra had been a member of the [[Central Committee of Grand Moffs]] that supported [[Trioculus]]'s claim to the Imperial throne.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\n{{Quote|This is Chief Administrator Vilim Disra, Shelkonwa, Shelsha sector. I have an urgent message for the Emperor and Lord Vader. Tell them I've located Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan.|Vilim Disra|Allegiance (novel)}}\nIn [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], Disra became chief administrator of [[Shelsha sector]], under [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Barshnis Choard]]. In [[0 ABY/Legends|0.5 ABY]] he double-crossed Choard, who wanted to orchestrate a secession of Shelsa from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. For roughly two years, Disra worked with Choard and a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] named [[Caaldra]] to put together an allegiance of [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] gangs under the [[BloodScar]]s and place them with the resources they would need to take over specific Imperial targets when the time came. Disra also managed to make contacts within the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], pretending that Shelsha would ally with the Rebellion in exchange for the Alliance's help in defending Shelsha from the expected Imperial reprisal.<ref name=\"Allegiance\">[[Allegiance (novel)|''Allegiance'']]</ref>\n{{Quote|What is your assessment of Disra?\"<br />\"He's a con artist and conniver. I wouldn't trust him any farther than I could see him.\"<br />\"Agreed. I don't intend to.|Darth Vader and Mara Jade|Allegiance (novel)}}\nHowever, Disra was planning to betray Choard, Caaldra, and the Rebel Alliance all along. He kept detailed records of everything, so that when the time came he could turn over Choard to [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Lord Vader]] and present himself as a hero to the Empire. He succeeded in his plan, made easier because Lord Vader and his [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] were already on Shelsha's capital of [[Shelkonwa]] due to a tip Disra had called in to [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]] informing Vader that Princess [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] was in the city. Though Disra had the [[Skirmish on Shelkonwa|city under lockdown]] to prevent her escape, she managed to do so with the help of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], the [[Hand of Judgment]], and&mdash;unwittingly&mdash;[[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]]. Disra made it clear to Vader that he wished to be named Governor of Shelsha after Choard's removal, but Palpatine refused to do so.<ref name=\"Allegiance\" />\n\n===Post-Endor===\nAt some point Disra sat on the Central Committee of Grand Moffs approximately a year after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. Afterward, he was demoted (possibly for supporting [[Bertroff Hissa]] and Trioculus). He engaged in the maneuvering that resulted in the assassination of [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Rufaan Tigellinus]], allowing Disra to take his place at the Committee. In [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], he began searching for someone to impersonate Thrawn successfully, to use in a plan to overthrow the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. By [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]] he was one of the eight members of the [[Council of Moffs]].\n\n===[[Caamas Document Crisis]]===\nDisra later hired the [[Con artist/Legends|con artist]] [[Flim]] to portray [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] in order to consolidate Imperial military power under the command of [[Sinister Triumvirate|a triumvirate]] consisting of Disra, Flim, and [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Grodin Tierce]]. Under the nominal leadership of Disra, the triumvirate laid out a plan to sabotage part of the planetary shield of [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]]. Meanwhile, they manipulated hostilities arising from the discovery of a [[Datacard/Legends|datacard]] implicating the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothans]] in the post-[[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] bombardment of [[Caamas/Legends|Caamas]].<ref name=\"HoTD\">''[[Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn Duology]]''</ref>\n\nDisra also employed the services of pirate gangs, most notably the Cavrilhu gang under Captain [[Zothip]]. The Remnant loaned Zothip's gang leftover clones from Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic 10 years earlier, and in return was supplied with [[Preybird-class starfighter|''Preybird''-class]] starfighters. The ''Preybirds'' were badly needed to augment the dwindling supply of [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]] in the Imperial Navy, and though far less intimidating, the Preybirds proved to be capable replacements. Disra hired the pirates to attack New Republic shipping convoys, letting Zothip's gang keep anything of value while forcing the New Republic to use valuable resources trying to stop the attacks. Disra used Zothip as a pawn until Zothip arrived at Disra's private office on Bastion with murderous intent. Fortunately for Disra, Zothip was killed by an assassin, a Mistryl Shadow Guard who had also sneaked into his estate.<ref name=\"HoTD\" />\n\nThough Disra was the creator of the secret triumvirate, he never really controlled it. Major Tierce manipulated the group from the beginning. Disra planned betrayal, plotting to kill Tierce and Flim when it came time to do so. He was unaware that Tierce knew of this, but he was in constant disagreement with the soldier, whom he suspected of planning to usurp his leadership. Disra continually attempted to gain the upper hand over him, but never really succeeded. As the first shots over Bothawui were fired, it was revealed that Tierce was, in fact, an unstable clone from a failed project. Disra's triumvirate was laid bare by information procured by smuggler/information broker [[Talon Karrde]] and Disra was arrested on grounds of [[Treason/Legends|treason]].<ref name=\"HoTD\" />\n\nThe Council of Moffs replaced him with [[Ephin Sarreti]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Allegiance (novel)|''Allegiance'']] {{C|First identified as Vilim}}\n*[[Allegiance (audiobook)|''Allegiance'' audiobook]] {{C|First identified as Vilim}}\n*{{Journal|8|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]''\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|under \"Gilad Pellaeon\"}} {{Imo}}\n*{{FFCite|102|CAA1-2, ''Caamas Document''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|66|Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Moffs19ABY}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Vilim Disra\n|de=Vilim Disra\n|es=Vilim Disra\n|ja=\u30f4\u30a3\u30ea\u30e0\u30fb\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30e9\n|pl=Vilim Disra\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043c \u0414\u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\n|fi=Vilim Disra\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Disra, Vilim}}\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Grand Moffs of the Central Committee]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moffs of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Moffs of the Imperial Remnant]]"}}}]}}}}
