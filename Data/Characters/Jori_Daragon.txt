I'm a damned good pilot.|Jori Daragon|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire}}\n'''Jori Daragon''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] native of [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros Major]] and a [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] explorer who lived circa [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]]. Although she and her brother, [[Gav Daragon]], were somewhat [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], they chose not to join the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and remained untrained in the use of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Following the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Daragon family|her parents]], she and Gav became indebted to [[Aarrba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. Running out of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], the two took their [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', on one last expedition from the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]] in hopes of repairing their finances by earning a commission from the [[Hyperspace Navigator's Guild|Brotherhood of Navigators]] for finding new [[hyperlane]]s. The Daragons accidentally discovered a [[Daragon Trail|trail]] that took them to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Korriban]]. They were [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] by the Sith and taken to the planet [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]] for [[Torture/Legends|interrogation]].\n\nEventually, they were sentenced to death by the Sith, but [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]] sprang them from prison and took them to his own fortress. Sadow hoped to convince the other Sith that the Daragons were the precursor for a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] invasion, as that would give him the support of the other Sith Lords for his plan to invade Republic [[Realspace/Legends|space]]. When Sadow's rival, [[Ludo Kressh]], attacked Sadow's fortress, Jori took the ''Starbreaker 12'' and escaped back to Republic space, knowing that she was the only means of warning the Republic of a Sith invasion. Little did she know that Sadow had placed a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing device]] on her ship and was planning on following the ''Starbreaker 12''{{'s}} course.\n\nShe returned to the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]] and, after overcoming arrest and incarceration for various crimes, managed to get an audience with [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta]], leader of the Koros [[Star system/Legends|system]], and several prominent [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]], including [[Memit Nadill]] and [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]]. Jori's warning came in time for a successful last-ditch [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|defense]] to be mounted against the oncoming Sith armada. However, Gav was aiding the Sith [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] and when Jori encountered him on Cinnagar, she chased her brother, trying to stop him. Although Gav eventually turned on the Sith, Sadow had him killed over [[Primus Goluud/Legends|Primus Goluud]]. However, Jori survived the war, and since one of its casualties had been Aarrba, she took over ownership of the Hutt's [[Aarrba's Repair Dock|repair dock]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Hey, mom and dad!

As children, Jori and her brother [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] tested high enough in [[The Force/Legends|Force]] potential to be accepted for [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] training, but they refused, seeking the wealth that could be found in a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer's]] lifestyle. They worked with their parents, [[Hok Daragon|Hok]] and [[Timar Daragon]], in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]]. The elder Daragons typically flew their [[Starship/Legends|ship]], ''[[Shadow Runner]]'', while the younger Daragons [[Pilot/Legends|piloted]] the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]''. The two often begged their parents to let them go on runs with them, but Hok and Timar usually forced them to remain on Koros Major. When Hok and Timar were killed by rebels while delivering supplies to [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta's]] soldiers in the [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|Battle of Kirrek]] during the [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|Unification Wars]], their financier, [[Aarrba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], extended their credit, claiming that their parents' ship had been paid for with their [[Blood/Legends|blood]]. Though they were grief-stricken at the loss of their parents, Jori and Gav took the ''Starbreaker 12'' and began a life mapping out new [[Hyperlane|hyperspace routes]].<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" />\n\nThe siblings, running low on funds and already forced to sell their dwelling as collateral to repay Aarrba, damaged the ''Starbreaker 12'' while flying through the [[Starswarm Cluster/Legends|Starswarm Cluster]] in an attempt to find a new route. The [[Hyperspace Navigator's Guild]] approved their route, the [[Goluud Corridor]], but marked it as risky. However, Jori and Gav soon found themselves with a price on their heads, put on by merchant [[Lord/Legends|lord]] [[Ssk Kahorr]] after one of his drone ships crashed into the giant [[Star/Legends|star]] [[Primus Goluud/Legends|Primus Goluud]] while using the Goluud Corridor. Kahorr had been hoping to reap large profits from use of the route, but was furious at the loss of his ship. In response, Kahorr sent a pair of [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] to kill them, and the Daragons came under attack one night while sleeping on the streets of Cinnagar. While Jori and Gav attempted to fend them off, they were unarmed save for rocks and a stick, while both assassins were armed with polearm weapons. The Daragons ran away, but were soon cornered, lamenting the turns of events that had brought them to their current position. However, at that point, two [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]] and [[Memit Nadill]], appeared and confronted the assassins. After the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] defeated the hired attackers, Nadill advised Jori and her brother to leave Koros Major, which they did. Later, Jori and Gav stole back the impounded ''Starbreaker 12'' and, pursued by Cinnagar security forces, punched in random coordinates, sending them on a blind jump into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]].<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" /> Neither of them were aware of it, but it was their unconscious use of the Force that enabled their statistically impossible jump.<ref name=\"TEA\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref>\n\n===Discovering the Sith Empire===\n{{Quote|We can say one thing for sure&mdash;nobody else has ever gone here.|Jori Daragon|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Golden Age of the Sith 2}}\n[[File:JoriaAndGavDaragon.png|thumb|right|250px|Jori and Gav arrive on Korriban.]]\nWhen the two explorers emerged from hyperspace, they realized they had journeyed far beyond charted territory. Spotting a nearby [[Star system/Legends|planetary system]], they set down on the world of [[Korriban]], not knowing that it was the [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], an ancient [[Species/Legends|species]] of [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]], Force-worshiping [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoids]]. As they descended, they noted the wealth visible from the [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]] and hoped that their new route would lead to the establishment of a viable and profitable trade route. Gav happily exclaimed that their problems were solved, but upon disembarking, Jori and Gav found themselves surrounded by armed Sith warriors, who took them prisoner.<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" />\n\nThe two siblings were placed in a [[Prison/Legends|prison]] on the Sith world of [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]] while the ruling [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] decided their fates. Lord [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]], who hoped to succeed the recently-deceased [[Marka Ragnos]] as the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], saw the two as an opportunity, a pathway for a Sith conquest of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], while his rival, [[Ludo Kressh]], feared that the arrival of the Daragons meant an impending Republic attack on the Sith. Kressh's arguments eventually prevailed, and Sith Lord [[Simus]] journeyed to the prison level and informed the Daragons that they were to be executed. Upon hearing that news, the siblings despaired and wished they had made different choices in the past. However, in the first step of his elaborate plan to become Dark Lord, Naga Sadow and his loyal group of [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] warriors attacked the Ziost prison, freeing Gav and Jori, and making it look like an attack that was orchestrated and carried out by the Republic by using weapons confiscated from the ''Starbreaker 12''. Gav and Jori were sent to Sadow's private fortress on [[Khar Shian]], grateful to be alive, as Sadow continued with the next phase of his plan. He used the prison break, which had cost the lives of numerous Sith warriors as well as Simus, a well respected member of the [[Sith Council]], as instigation to have himself crowned the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith and begin preparations for an attack on the Republic.<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" />\n\nShortly afterward, Jori was separated from her brother, being sent to Khar Shian's icy host planet of [[Khar Delba]], where Sadow had a decoy fortress, a duplicate of his stronghold on Khar Shian. Sadow assured her that she was not being kept as a prisoner, despite her isolation and meager living quarters. She asked the Sith about the fate of her brother, but Sadow told her that the still active execution order meant that the Daragons could not be released yet. In response, she told him that she and Gav would need the ''Starbreaker 12'', in order to get back to Republic [[Realspace/Legends|space]]. After many days, she was finally able to get through to Gav, as Sadow presented her with an [[Sith amulet|amulet]] that allowed Gav, whom Sadow had been training in the Force, to contact her in an audio and visual format projected from the amulet, linking the brother and sister. Sadow also presented her with the ''Starbreaker 12'', which his Massassi warriors had seized from Kressh's forces in a commando raid. However, Kressh learned of Sadow's involvement in the raid, as Sadow had wished, and launched an attack on the decoy fortress, where Sadow and Jori were.<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" />\n\nSadow told Jori that he had promised her safe return to the Republic and bade her enter the ''Starbreaker 12'' and escape. She was reluctant to leave without Gav, but the Sith told her she had no choice if either of them were to survive. Powering up the engines, she found the [[Navigation computer/Legends|navigation computer]] coordinates back to Republic space intact. Weaving through the attacking ships, she managed to slip through their [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] and jump to hyperspace back to the Republic, promising herself that she would return with help to free Gav. However, she was unaware that Sadow had purposefully allowed her to return to the Republic and planted a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing device]] on her ship so he could follow her with an armada with which to attack the Republic.<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" />\n\n===Return to the Republic===\n[[File:JGD.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gav and Jori Daragon, hyperspace navigators.]]\n{{Quote|I've returned and do I ever have a story to tell!|Jori Daragon, upon landing on Cinnagar|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire}}\nUpon the ''Starbreaker 12''{{'s}} reversion from hyperspace over Cinnagar, Jori nearly collided with a ship leaving [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]]. She averted collision and hailed Cinnagar's authorities, claiming she had an important message. However, they took a dim view of her return in light of the circumstances of her departure and launched interceptors to escort the ''Starbreaker 12'' down to the surface, and she followed their instructions. After landing, Jori disembarked and attempted to relay her story, only to be immediately arrested for several crimes, including stealing the ''Starbreaker 12''. All attempts to warn the guards were in vain and she was conducted to a detention center. Her old patron, Aarrba, was disappointed with her, saying he had had enough of her lies, and her ship was seized by Ssk Kahorr as compensation for the loss of his merchant ship. Her trial followed shortly afterward, with the guards informing her that the evidence was clear-cut against her. Disheartened, Jori wondered how she was going to help Gav and how she was going to convince her captors of her sincerity.<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\">''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire]]''</ref>\n\nHer trial proceeded with her being charged with multiple crimes, including grand theft, firing on Cinnagar security ships, destruction of property, reckless mayhem, resisting arrest, and unauthorized departure through restricted shipping lanes. She admitted her guilt and tried to warn her captors of the Sith, but was again ignored. As a result of her confession, she was sentenced to hard labor on the colony world of [[Ronika/Legends|Ronika]]. Working at [[Mining/Legends|mining]] by hand, she felt she had to escape and therefore stole a [[Drone ore shuttle|Drone Ore Shuttle]] . She was pursued into orbit by [[Starfighter/Legends|fighters]], but her ship was sturdy enough to shrug off their weapons blasts. Returning to Cinnagar, a much larger group of fighters was waiting for her and her ship suffered severe damage, breaking up in the middle of the [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]]. Jori grabbed a [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] [[Escape Repulsorchute|chute]] and flew out of the doomed ore shuttle toward the palace of Empress Teta. Climbing up the walls of the palace, Jori managed to reach the throne room and was immediately set upon by the guards, who figured her to be an assassin, as did the Empress herself. Holding out a [[Jori Daragon's amulet|Sith amulet]] she had brought with her, Jori managed to convince Teta and her Jedi advisors, Odan-Urr and Memit Nadill, of the veracity of her claim. Odan-Urr had previously experienced visions of the return of the Sith, and Jori's return convinced him that war was imminent. He remained on Cinnagar while Nadill returned to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] capital, to warn the rest of the Jedi and the Republic.<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" />\n\n===Great Hyperspace War===\n{{Quote|All the victories in this universe won't bring my brother back&hellip;|Jori Daragon|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire}}\n[[File:JoridaragonHS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jori Daragon around the time of the Great Hyperspace War]]\nAs Empress Teta prepared for [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|war]], rallying her [[Troop/Legends|troops]] and fleet, Jori was eager to find a ship or at least a weapon to aid in the defense of Koros Major. Odan-Urr gave her a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and she left the Empress's palace to find a ship at [[Aarrba's Repair Dock]]. As she journeyed there, Sith ships [[Battle of Koros Major (Great Hyperspace War)|attacked]] Cinnagar, deploying land troops. The Sith amulet she still held in her possession began to tingle and she suspected that Gav was nearby. Arriving at Aarrba's Repair Dock, she found Gav and his Massassi [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]] standing over Aarrba's corpse. Jori assumed that Gav had slain Aarrba, and she attacked him and his bodyguards, but he managed to flee, using a Sith craft to return to a [[Derriphan-class battleship|Sith battleship]]. Jori seized a ship of her own and followed him, but Gav's [[Warship/Legends|battleship]] jumped to hyperspace, bound for Primus Goluud, where Naga Sadow had his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], a [[Sith Meditation Sphere]], stationed. From his sphere, Sadow used [[Sith magic|Sith sorcery]] to generate [[Mind trick/Legends|illusions]] of additional Sith forces on worlds across the galaxy, as well as use [[battle meditation]] to influence battles.<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" />\n\nGav confronted Sadow and turned on him, attacking the meditation sphere and damaging it, but Sadow convinced Gav to meet him face-to-face. Gav acquiesced and when he arrived on the meditation sphere, he found it deserted. When Jori, accompanied by a portion of Teta's fleet, arrived over Primus Goluud, they found that the last remnants of Sadow's fleet had returned there as well from various engagements. The two fleets engaged one another, and Gav informed them that the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]] was vulnerable; Sadow had brought his entire fleet to attack the Republic. However, he was trapped on the meditation sphere when Sadow triggered a [[Supernova/Legends|supernova]] in the giant star. Knowing that he couldn't escape in time, he told Jori and the Empress's forces to escape before the star exploded, saying he was sorry for having aided the Sith in their invasion. Tearfully, Jori bade farewell to her brother as Teta's fleet jumped to hyperspace just before Primus Goluud [[Primus Goluud Supernova|exploded]].<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" />\n\nTeta's fleet arrived in the Sith Empire at the coordinates provided by Gav, striking against a Sith battle fleet already weakened by the failed assault on the Republic and further infighting between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh. The Sith were defeated and Sadow escaped with only a single ship in the face of Teta's onslaught. Jori was glad to see the Sith defeated, but was still saddened over the loss of her brother. Upon their return to Cinnagar, she was summoned to the presence of the Empress, who recognized the losses she had taken in the war and asked her if there was anything she wanted. In response, Jori asked for and was granted ownership of Aarrba's Repair Dock, which had been a dream for her and her brother for years.<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" />\n\n[[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]] had several interviews with Jori, owing to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi's]] interest in the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]]. With her help, the whole backstory of the War could be included in the [[Tedryn Holocron]] to reserve all information for the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].<ref name=\"EGTTF\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nYears after her lifetime, Jori Daragon was remembered for her role in starting the Great Hyperspace War,<ref name=\"Firestorm\">{{Journal|15|Firestorm (short story)|Firestorm}}</ref> including in a compilation of Jedi history and lore created by Jedi [[Tionne Solusar]] in [[40 ABY]]. In the years after the Daragons, some historians pointed out that the Great Hyperspace War might have been avoided had Jedi Odan-Urr not saved the Daragons from Kahorr's assassins, but Solusar believed that the Daragons could not be held responsible for the start of the war.<ref name=\"EGTTF\" /> Their role was long remembered throughout history for blazing what was considered one of the most remarkable hyperlanes of the Old Republic era. The hyperlane, named the Daragon Trail, provided a passage directly from the Deep Core to Sith space.<ref name=\"TEA\" /> Information about the Daragons was also included on the ''[[Omen]]'', a ship bearing a group of people who would eventually found the [[Lost Tribe of Sith]] on [[Kesh]].<ref name=\"Ascension\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Ascension]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What?

She was willing to commit a large number of crimes in an attempt by her and her brother to break out of their destitute circumstances. She was also easily upset, weeping openly on numerous occasions. Her brother, and to a lesser extent, her ship, the ''Starbreaker 12'', were the two main things she prioritized after the [[Death/Legends|death]] of her parents. She often lamented the injustice of her and Gav's situation, being less optimistic than her brother. She was also na\u00efve, believing that people, including the Sith Lord Naga Sadow, were as sincere as she was.<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" /> She was determined to do what she felt was the right thing, even risking her life for an audience with Empress Teta to deliver a warning about the Sith threat. This, too, was partially motivated out of her care for Gav, who was still a prisoner of the Sith. When she found Gav allied with the Sith, she was horrified and felt betrayed, but held out hope for him. The loss of her brother affected her emotionally,<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" /> and for her the victory in the Great Hyperspace War was bittersweet<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> and caused her to be more contrite. She was gladdened to take ownership of Aarrba's Repair Dock, though, feeling that it was what Gav and even Aarrba would have wanted.<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" />\n\nJori, like her brother Gav, was Force-sensitive, but was never trained as a Jedi out of a desire to make money as a hyperspace explorer.<ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" /> However, in combat, she was capable of wielding a lightsaber, though she had never done so, and cut down several Massassi warriors in Cinnagar.<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" /> She was also a skilled pilot, eluding [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] authorities and Sith patrols on several occasions, as well as helping map new hyperspace routes.<ref name=\"The Fall of the Sith Empire\" /><ref name=\"Golden Age of the Sith\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Jori Daragon was conceived and written by [[Kevin J.
