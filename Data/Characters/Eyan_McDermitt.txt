Meanwhile, an individual by the name [[Sarlis Beni]] was contacted by Incom Corporation to retrieve the datapad. Beni localized the pirate gang and dispatched a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] to recover the storage data. The spy killed four members of the gang and confronted McDermitt. The pirate leader was forced to reveal he had sold the datapad to Jubai Laetlii. The spy then left the pirates and departed to the [[Imperial Oasis]] to find Laetlii.
