He was one of the many lives who crossed paths with that of [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] following the memory wipe of the fomer [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]]. He was killed when he attempted to stop Revan for letting the Wookiee [[Freyyr]] live.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn Knights of the Old Republic, if the player decides to have Revan kill Freyyr, Gorwooken will not attack them and instead give them a personal escort to Chuundar himself due to have heard from his spies that Freyyr has been killed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gorwooken\n|es=Gorwooken\n|nl=Gorwooken\n|pl=Gorwooken\n|ru=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0432\u0443\u043a\u0435\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
