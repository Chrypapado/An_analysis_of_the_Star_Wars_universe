A group led by [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Varias]], including Sergeant Hirka, [[Officer/Legends|Officers]] [[Jornel Savas|Savas]], [[Druno Kener|Kener]] and [[Mener]] and several CorSec troopers, was dispatched from Coronet to investigate. The unit discovered an old and fully automated [[Corellia Droid Factory|droid factory]], presumably built in secret by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] during the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"SWG:TtLV\" /> The CorSec ignored that the factory had been reactivated by [[IG-88A/Legends|IG-88]] for his project of [[Droid Revolution]].<ref name=\"SWG:DtDF\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Disable the Droid Factory|Corellia}}</ref>\n[[File:Corellia_Droid_Factory_3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Battle droids patrolling the [[Corellia Droid Factory]].]]\nUpon their arrival, Sergeant Hirka and her team was sent into the factory to scout out the place. However, after their initial transmissions, the CorSec scouts encountered hostile battle droids that patrolled the facility. The droids cut off Hirka's line of retreat and the CorSec group was forced to fortify a small room while waiting for reinforcements. In the meantime, Lieutenant Varias recruited independent spacers to assist the CorSec in the droid factory. When Sergeant Hirka's group was reported missing, Varias dispatched a spacer to locate them. Fortunately, the spacer was able to rescue the scout team, trapped since a while in the fortified room. Lieutenant Varias was indeed very relieved that Sergeant Hirka and her group had survived.<ref name=\"SWG:LtLCP\" /> Eventually, the CorSec would successfully manage to shut down the Corellia Droid Factory.<ref name=\"SWG:DtDF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSergeant Hirka was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:LtLCP\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Sergeant Hirka was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Corellia Droid Factory|Corellian Droid Factory]]\" arc with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Game Update 12|Game Update 12]]\", on [[August 10]], [[2009]].<ref>{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/posts/list.m?topic_id=976424|text=Game Update 12: Engineering Trader|archivedate=20090816090206}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Locate the Lost Corsec Patrol}}\n\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
