She was born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]], and lived on the world for all her life. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the [[Thaereian military]] was driven out of the [[Cularin system]], and Cularin became a full voting member of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. In the aftermath of the transfer of power, Reva attended a rally in the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Gadrin]] that had been organized by the [[Human/Legends|Humans]] [[Nia Reston]] and [[San Herrera]], and she voiced her opinion on the changeover, stating that she believed Cularin didn't need [[Thaere Privo|Thaere]] and that it didn't need the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Republic Senate]]. A [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] subsequently spoke in support of Reva's claim.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050707ballcomers|text=All Comers|int=All Comers|archivedate=20090603045815}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
