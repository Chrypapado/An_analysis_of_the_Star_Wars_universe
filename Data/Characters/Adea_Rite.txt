She was present during the abortive [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Emergency summit on Akiva|emergency summit]] on the [[planet]] [[Akiva]]. Rite was taken [[Prisoner|captive]] by [[New Republic]] [[New Republic Defense Force|forces]] during the [[Rebellion on Akiva]]. However, [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]] arranged her escape and Rite found herself serving Admiral Sloane again. In secret, Rite was an undercover [[agent]] of Rax, whose agenda for the Empire clashed with Sloane's personal beliefs. Rite [[Death|died]] while attempting to kill Sloane during the [[Attack on Chandrila|attack]] on [[Chandrila]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Summit on Akiva===\nDuring the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], Adea Rite served as [[Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]]'s personal [[Aide|assistant]]. Her job was to hand Sloane [[paper]]s, fetch cups of [[caf]], ask for signatures, and deliver communications, but she longed to be more, to deepen her service to the [[Galactic Empire]]. She worked closely with Sloane and the two grew to respect each other, with Sloane wishing there were more Imperials like her and Rite admiring Sloane greatly. She found that there was no better [[time]] to be alive, because in the cracks of the Empire there was room for advancement for people like her.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nOn [[Akiva]], during the [[Emergency summit on Akiva|meeting]] of the [[Imperial Future Council]], Rite kept Sloane up to date on the events taking place on the [[planet]], which were growing more tumultuous by the [[Standard day|day]]. When [[Captain]] [[Wedge Antilles]] escaped their custody on Akiva, she went to chase him down personally, but was ambushed and injured by the [[Rebel pilot]]. She continued to serve Sloane, and was on the ''[[Golden Harp]]'', their escape [[Starship|vessel]], when it crash landed on the [[Vigilance (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Vigilance'']]. She was then captured by the [[New Republic]].<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n===Rax's secret agent===\n[[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]] saw to it personally that she never found herself in a [[prison]] cell on [[Chandrila]], the [[capital]] world of the New Republic. Rite returned to assist Sloane once again, aboard the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Ravager]]''. Because Sloane did not trust Rax, who served as her new [[advisor]], she asked Rite to investigate his past as well as to catalog all ships in the [[Imperial Military|Imperial service]] at the time of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. Rite was also tasked with [[writing]] a proposal for a new breeding program.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\nUnknown to Sloane, Rite was monitoring all of Sloane's activities and reporting them to Rax, her secret lover. Rite accompanied Sloane to the [[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]] [[Imperial-Republic peace talks|Peace Talks]] on Chandrila. As Sloane discovered that the intended peace initiative on Chandrila, orchestrated by Rax, was a ploy for using [[prisoner]]s of war to [[Attack on Chandrila|attack]] [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] and the [[New Republic Senate|Galactic Senate]], she was furious and vowed to destroy Rax. Hearing this, Rite attempted to [[assassin]]ate Sloane, who had realized that her own assistant betrayed her. Sloane shot Rite in the chest and fled the planet.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAdea Rite was a young [[Corellian]] [[human]] [[Gender|female]] who grew up on Coruscant and served in the [[Imperial Navy]] following the [[Battle of Endor]]. She served as a personal assistant to Admiral Sloane but longed to deepen her service to the Empire. She grew to respect Sloane for her selfless service and commitment to the Empire. Rite regarded the chaotic aftermath following [[Endor]] as an opportunity to advance her career in the Empire. As a staunch Imperial loyalist, Rite opposed the New Republic and sought to make a name for herself by recapturing the [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] Wedge Antilles. Despite her training in unarmed combat, she was defeated by Antilles.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nWhile outwardly loyal and devoted to Admiral Sloane, Rite was a secret agent of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, who had differences of opinion with Sloane on Imperial strategy and tactics. She had a romantic relationship with her secret benefactor and was loyal to him. Rite was even willing to kill her employer Admiral Sloane to prove her loyalty to Rax.<ref name=\"LD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAdea Rite first appeared as a minor antagonist in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2015]] novel [[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']]. She also appeared in the novel's [[2016]] sequel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']] {{1st|[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Aftermath: Empire's End (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Empire's End'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Adea Rite\n|fr=Adea Rite\n|ja=\u30a2\u30c7\u30a2\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\n|pl=Adea Rite\n|ru=\u0410\u0434\u0435\u044f \u0420\u0430\u0439\u0442\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rite, Adea}}\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Martial artists]]\n[[Category:Personnel of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
