Passing his [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]] and ascending to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], Gel accepted missions from the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] as an active duty Jedi.<ref name=\"COL\" />\n\nWhen the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] erupted across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Gel took up the mantle of [[Jedi General/Legends|General]] within the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] and went out to combat the [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Separatist Droid Army]]. Surviving until the end of the war, Jedi Gel was able to escape the deadly execution of [[Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150|Contingency]] [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] by the treacherous [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. The order, commanding all [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] in the Grand Army to turn against their Jedi leaders, effectively wiped out the Jedi Order and sent all survivors into hiding. Going to ground, Gel fled to [[Dalicron-4]] where he fathered a [[Caeleb's father|child]] and started a farm.<ref name=\"COL\" />\n\nThe farm, centered around an ancient tree, was contained inside a dead spot in the Force. In fact, the tree contained the spirit of the ancient [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Duumas]], who had taken up residence in the tree in order to protect a long ago foreseen \"[[Child of Light]]\". This child of prophecy was in fact Gel's grandson, [[Caeleb]], who lived with his family including his sister, [[Jhara]]. While Caeleb grew up ignorant to the Force, Gel still feared that one day Palpatine and his [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] would find and kill his family. Therefore, when the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] proclaimed [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] as their own Jedi Knight fighting to destroy the Empire, Jedi Gel sent word to Skywalker that he had a Force-user in need of protection. While Skywalker was considered too vital to the war effort to be spared for such a mission, the Alliance dispatched a team to recover Caeleb and escort him to an Alliance stronghold.<ref name=\"COL\" />\n\nHowever, before the Alliance could arrive, Gel's home was visited invaded by the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Tol Skaros]], the [[Whiphid/Legends|Whiphid]] apprentice to [[Thaum Rystra]]. Skaros disarmed the old Jedi and interrogated him for the location of Caeleb, the object of Master Rystra's desires. Gel refused to give into Skaros' techniques until the Whiphid convinced the aging man that he was going to kill his granddaughter Jhara. Loosing his composure, Gel gave into the Dark Jedi and revealed the location of the Force void and the farm it concealed. Skaros had no mercy on the broken Jedi and fatally wounded Gel, leaving him to die alone on his small farm before hunting down Caeleb. While the Dark Jedi killed both of Caeleb's parents, the Alliance operatives were able to rescue Caeleb and kill the Dark Jedi before his mission was completed..<ref name=\"COL\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Child of Light]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Light and Dark (adventure)|''Light and Dark'']] {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Dalicron-4 residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Generals]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
