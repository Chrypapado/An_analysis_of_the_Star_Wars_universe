At the end of the corrupt [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ars Veruna/Legends|Veruna's]] reign, he fell in love with the then-[[Princess of Theed]], [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Naberrie]], when he saw her for the first [[Time/Legends|time]] in the [[Palace Plaza/Legends|Palace Plaza]].<ref name=\"ASD\" /> He would later accompany her and her parents to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] as a volunteer at the [[Tannik Spaceport|spaceport]] docks of the [[Refugee Relief Movement/Legends|Refugee Relief Movement]].<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\nDuring his brief relationship with Padm\u00e9, Ian's [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Kun Lago]], secretly found out about their relationship and even witnessed them kissing. And though Ian failed to disclose to Padm\u00e9 his father's position in Veruna's court, she later found out on her own. Ian's father forbade him to ever see Padm\u00e9 again and threatened to disown Ian if he did not comply with his wishes.<ref name=\"ASD\" />\n\n[[File:VerunaAbdication.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ian Lago learns of King Veruna's abdication.]]\nIan was near at hand when King Veruna [[Eriadu Trade Summit|abdicated]] the throne due to [[Foreign Affairs scandal|scandal]] and [[Bombing of Sojourn|other]] political pressures.<ref name=\"SWDP\" /> But before Padm\u00e9 was officially elected to the [[Monarch of Naboo|monarchy of Naboo]] and became [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] Amidala, Ian declared his love to her; even so, she ended their relationship to devote her time to the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|people of Naboo]]. Padm\u00e9 sensed that Veruna's abdication must be taking a toll on Ian's family, and she advised him to return home to them. Though she would always care for him, and treasure the time they'd spent together over the summer, she had pledged her heart to the people years ago when she left her mountain village.<ref name=\"ASD\" />\n\nHeartbroken, Ian departed from Naboo to parts unknown.<ref name=\"ASD\" />\n\n{{Cutstart}}\n[[File:GovernorIanLago.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Governor Ian Lago during the time of the Galactic Civil War]]\nHowever, by the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Ian Lago returned to Naboo and served as the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] [[Governor/Legends|governor]]. As governor, Ian Lago was openly loyal to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], and worked closely with an [[Aide/Legends|aide]] of his named [[Junelle Astor]]. During this time, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] wishing to serve the governor assisted Astor with a number of [[Politics/Legends|political]] issues. For instance, she tasked the spacer with protecting [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|Queen]] [[Kylantha]] from [[High Inquisitor]] [[Mal Sikander]], who believed the Queen was secretly aiding the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Eventually, Astor cleared the spacer and granted access to the governor's office.<ref name=\"SWGCC\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref>\n\nIan Lago was pleased to have the individual work under him. His first task for the spacer was to deliver surveillance equipment to an agent of his named [[Eevas Drupper]], who was investigating reports of a group of [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]] aiding the Rebellion. The spacer succeeded, but Ian Lago soon encountered a problem involving another one of his agents, a Gungan named [[Boona Deeks]]. Deeks was loyal to the Empire, and was aiding the governor with [[Spy/Legends|spying]] on traitorous Gungans. However, Deeks's allegiance was uncovered by his fellow Gungans, forcing him to flee. His life in danger, Deeks hid inside the [[Death/Legends|dead]] body of a [[Bola/Legends|bola]] for a couple [[Standard day/Legends|days]] before being rescued by the spacer dispatched by Governor Lago.<ref name=\"SWGCC\" />\n\nGovernor Ian Lago, despite being supportive of the Empire, was annoyed by High Inquisitor Mal Sikander's persistent attempts to accuse Queen Kylantha of treachery. When one of Sikander's agents managed to acquire the queen's private correspondence, he tasked the spacer with killing the traitor, hoping it would send a clear message to the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]]. The spacer succeeded, but he ended up also having to capture a troubadour named [[Ryd Rozen]] when it became clear that he was the one who aided Sikander's agent with stealing the queen's property. Eventually though, Queen Kylantha did in fact end up supporting a group of Gungans implicated with [[Treason/Legends|treasonous]] activities. To defuse the situation, Governor Lago tasked the spacer with traveling to the Gungan's camp, and killing their leader, [[Yip Kanoos]].<ref name=\"SWGCC\" />\n\nAnother situation then developed, involving a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Rhys Dallows]] named [[Leana Kilnar]]. When Governor Lago learned that Lieutenant Kilnar was under investigation by Sikander, he tasked the spacer with eliminating her.<ref name=\"SWGCC\" />\n{{Cutend}}\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Ian Lago}}\n*{{Tales|5|A Summer's Dream}} {{1st}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{C|Cut content}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Ian Lago\n|pt=Ian Lago\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lago, Ian}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
