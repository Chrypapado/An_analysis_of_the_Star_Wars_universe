Blackstripe was [[Slavery|enslaved]] by the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> In [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"Life Debt Date\" /> Blackstripe was hunted by a modified [[SD-K4 assassin droid|assassin probe]] remotely controlled by [[Grand Moff]] [[Lozen Tolruck]], who enjoyed [[hunting]] and [[Death|killing]] Wookiees for amusement. Tolruck used the [[assassin]] probe to fire two [[toxo-dart]]s into Blackstripe's chest. When the [[poison]] failed to slow down the Wookiee, who continued climbing a [[wroshyr tree]], Tolruck used his control visor to remotely launch the assassin probe into Blackstripe and explode. The explosion destroyed both the droid and killed Blackstripe. Dissatisfied with the hunt, he crushed his control visor in disgust.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0421\u0443\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442 478-98\n|pl=Obiekt 478-98\n}}\n\n[[Category:Imperial slaves]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
