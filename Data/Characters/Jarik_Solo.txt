Lied to you.|Jarik Solo to Han Solo|Rebel Dawn}}\n'''Jarik Solo''' was a street urchin from [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] who claimed to be a long lost relative of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. Han soon discovered that was not true, but he liked the boy, and perhaps because of his skills, worshipful demeanor toward Han, or sympathy of his past, Han let Jarik tag along on his adventures. Soon Jarik became a talented gunner for both the ''[[Bria]]'' and the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. Jarik worked as a mechanic for a short time on Nar Shaddaa and also played a small role during the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]], by shooting down a few [[TIE/LN starfighter]]s. Jarik went with Han to assist him, and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]], in the [[Battle of Ylesia]]. He was severely wounded and just before [[Death/Legends|dying]], he admitted not being related to Han Solo and apologized. Han, however, allowed the boy to \"keep\" his name, saying that he had earned it long ago.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jarik Solo\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Solo, Jarik}}\n[[Category:Aliases, nicknames, and pseudonyms]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
