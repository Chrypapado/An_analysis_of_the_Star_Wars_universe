After Syn left, Gusha poured two glasses of [[Merenzane Gold/Legends|Merenzane Gold]] for the [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Imperial]] agent [[Gunn Yage]], into one of which she slipped a drug in order to knock Skywalker [[Sleep/Legends|unconscious]]. Yage took her prey elsewhere, and when Syn returned shortly thereafter, Gusha told the co-pilot of the events that had transpired in his absence.<ref name=\"l38\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGusha appeared in the [[Legacy (2006) 38|thirty-eighth issue]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic-book]] series, written by [[John Ostrander]], illustrated by [[Jan Duursema]], and published by [[Marvel Comics]]<ref name=\"l38\" /> on [[July 29]], [[2009]].<ref name=\"Marvel\">{{Marvel|comics/issue/54410/star_wars_legacy_2006_38|Star Wars: Legacy (2006) #38}}</ref> A glossary included in the issue's letters section indicates that the word Gusha translates to \"Lucky\" in Huttese meaning that Gusha's cantina could be called \"Lucky's Luck.\"<ref name=\"l38\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Legacy (2006) 38|''Legacy'' (2006) 38]] {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gusha\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gusha}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Lepi]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
