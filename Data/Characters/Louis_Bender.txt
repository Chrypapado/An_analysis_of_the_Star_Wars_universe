However, prior to the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], the three young boys managed to escape their abusive father with the help of a [[Meatlump King|mysterious individual]] who would later become the [[Meatlump King]].

In fact, Lucien Bender had placed a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on his three sons. However, he ignored that a much larger bounty was placed on him and his gang. Bossk intended to force Hraykken and Draykken to handle Lucien for him so he could collect the most substantial bounty. Bossk was keeping Louis in custody in a camp near Lucien's [[Bofa Treat Gang bunker|bunker]] when the spacer arrived to rescue Louis Bender. The bounty hunter agreed with freeing the Louis Bender upon Lucien would be killed. The spacer therefore attacked the Bofa Treat Gang and finally killed Lucien Bender in the depths of the bunker.
