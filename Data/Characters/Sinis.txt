Sinis thus recruited a spacer to investigate the ship crash site and retrieve as much equipment as possible. The spacer spotted and fought several [[Deflarians|Deflarian]] scavengers around the wreck. Sinis then requested his friend [[Yorick]] to analyze the flight recorder recovered from the Deflarians. The [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] finally discovered that the flight recorder was modified by the Deflarians. Sinis later tasked the spacer to attack the [[Deflarian Communications Post]] in order to find information about the insolvent of the Deflarians in the crash. This led the spacer to another Deflarian camp were the spacer defeated a Deflarian lieutenant and his enforcers, and finally retrieved Sinis's medical equipment, stolen by the Deflarians. Sinis was glad to recover his missing cargo. He later transmitted all the information gathered about the Deflarians to [[Inspector/Legends|Inspector]] [[Cora (Human)|Cora]] of the [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]].<ref name=\"SWG:CaB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Crash and Burn|Corellia}}</ref> This eventually led to the discovery that the Deflarians hijacked the ship to stole its cargo and then crashed a ship of the same model to cover the theft.<ref name=\"SWG:DC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Deflarian Cleanup|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSinis appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TtSiT\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Sinis was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 28 Notes for April 26, 2006|Publish 28]]\", on [[April 26]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 28 Update Notes, April 26th|archivedate=20060427125323}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 28 Update Notes, April 26th|archivedate=20060427125323}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Talk to Sinis in Tyrena}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]"}}}]}}}}
