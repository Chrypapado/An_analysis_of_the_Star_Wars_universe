He joined the [[Longo Two-Guns's gang|gang]] of the [[gunslinger]] [[Longo Two-Guns]] when they arrived on Tatooine and managed to bolster there numbers with local muscle. When the gang became rivals of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|Crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], Miktha attempted to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] him at a [[Podracing/Legends|Podracing]] [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|event]] but was unsuccessful. The Hutt then placed a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on the Jawa's head, which the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]] claimed in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], capturing Miktha alive.\n\n==Biography==\nThe Jawa Miktha worked as a criminal on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the final [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"BH\" /> When the [[Clantaani]] [[gunslinger]] [[Longo Two-Guns]] arrived on Tatooine with his [[Longo Two-Guns's gang|gang]] looking to carved out a niche, he quickly made contact with Miktha. The Jawa then introduced the gang leader to the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Frossk]] and two [[Nikto/Legends|Nikto]], [[Ona Kragg]] and [[Naktu Jeera]]. The three agreed to join with Two-guns, and each brought additional men of their own to boost the groups size. With his newly expanded gang, Longo and his associates, including Miktha, took over the [[City/Legends|settlement]] of [[Mos Gamos]], where they established a base of operations within an old [[Podracer/Legends|podracer]] warehouse. The group then began to take over local criminal operations and quickly clashed with [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] also based on the planet. The group soon allied with Jabba's rival, [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder/Legends|Gardulla Besadii the Elder]] in a [[Death stick/Legends|death stick]] distribution deal and began targeting Jabba in some of their operations. In [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]] Miktha and another gang member, [[Radd Hardwikk]], attempted to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] their Hutt enemy by distributing explosive [[Gorg/Legends|chubas]] at the [[Boonta Eve Classic (31 BBY)|Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing/Legends|podracing]] [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|event]] he attended in the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}</ref> The plan however was unsuccessful, with the chubas not killing Jabba, but causing a small riot instead<ref name=\"BH\" /> and reducing the profits made from [[Foodstuff/Legends|foodstuff]] sales at the event.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|313|Miktha}}</ref> For inciting the riot the Hutt placed a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on Miktha's head, offering 100{{Cr}} for his capture alive, or 50{{Cr}} for his [[Death/Legends|death]]. The bounty gave the Jawa's last known location as the peripheral region of Mos Eisley and claimed he was affiliated with other Jawas, whom Jabba considered scum.<ref name=\"BH\" />\n[[File:JangoFett-NEC.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Miktha was captured by Jango Fett.]]\nThe Following [[32 BBY/Legends|year]], the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]] traveled to Tatooine whilst pursuing leads on the [[Bando Gora/Legends|Bando Gora]] cult, which suggested Gardulla worked with them. Once on Tatooine he set out to claim a bounty Jabba had placed on Two-guns head, travelling to Mos Gamos and fighting through the Clantaani gang protecting him.<ref name=\"BH\" /> Whilst making his way through the settlement, Fett encounter Miktha, who was unarmed, and captured him alive. The bounty hunter then went on to capture or kill several other gang members with bountys, including Two-guns himself, delivering those captured alive to Jabba once he left Mos Gamos.<ref name=\"SU\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBy the time Longo Two-guns arrived on Tatooine, Miktha had enough of a reputation as a criminal for the Clantaani to approach him and allow him into his gang. Miktha also managed to introduce Two-Guns to a number of other local thugs who joined up with him.<ref name=\"SU\" /> When first approached by Fett Miktha did not attempt to flee, however once [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] fire began to be exchanged between Fett and other members of Two-guns gang the Jawa cowered in fear. He had [[Color/Legends|yellow]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"BH\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nMiktha made used of explosive chubas during his attempt on Jabba's life, but when Fett encountered him he was unarmed. Like most Jawas, Miktha wore brown [[Robe/Legends|robes]].<ref name=\"BH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMiktha first appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]'' which was released by [[LucasArts]] in [[2002]]. In the game Miktha was an optional secondary bounty players could choose to capture dead or alive in the second stage of the fifth level of the game. He later received an entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' released in [[2009]] and was mentioned in the first part of ''[[So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars]]'', an article released on the [[StarWars.com]] [[Star Wars Blog|blog]] in [[2013]]. The article confirmed that Fett claimed all the bounties available in Longo's gang including Miktha, and captured them dead or alive based on which state was worth more. As Miktha was worth 50{{Cr}} more alive than dead Fett captured him alive.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30df\u30af\u30b5\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Jawas]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
