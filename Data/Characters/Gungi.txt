Rare you are to the Jedi. Proud, your people must be.|Professor Huyang to Gungi|A Test of Strength}}\n'''Gungi''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[Wookiee]] [[Jedi Initiate|Jedi youngling]] who was [[Jedi training|training]] to become a [[Jedi]] in the [[Jedi Order]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. During the war, Gungi and a group of five other younglings, [[Petro]], [[Katooni]], [[Byph]], [[Ganodi]], and [[Zatt]], were deemed to be at the top of their class and, led by [[Ahsoka Tano]] and Jedi Grand Master Yoda, they traveled to [[Ilum]] to participate in [[the Gathering]]; an ancient Jedi ritual that proved a [[youngling]]'s readiness to become a [[Padawan]].\n\n==Biography==\n===The Gathering===\n[[File:Gungi-TCWs5BR1.png|thumb|left|200px|Gungi running]]\nGungi, who was among the top of his class, was sent to [[Ilum]] with five of [[Gender|his]] fellow [[Jedi]] [[Jedi Initiate|younglings]]. While on Ilum, the [[youngling]]s were instructed by [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]] to enter a [[Crystal Cave]] and find their [[kyber crystal]]s, which were necessary for the younglings to construct their first [[lightsaber]]s. Every [[crystal]] in the cave was specific to each individual. Gungi found his crystal on an island across a body of [[water]] within the cave. Following [[Ganodi]]'s advice not go into the freezing water, he meditated to wait for the body of water to freeze so he could cross. He was later commended by Master Yoda on his patience.<ref name=\"TCW:TG\" />\n\n===Captured by pirates===\nWhile on their way back to [[Coruscant]] aboard the ''[[Crucible]]'', Gungi and his fellow younglings began creating their lightsabers under the guidance of [[Professor]] [[Huyang]] when the Jedi's [[Starship|ship]] was [[Raid on the Crucible|attacked]] by the [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Hondo and his pirate [[Ohnaka Gang|crew]] were looking for the kyber crystals the younglings had just collected as they were worth lots of [[credit]]s on the [[black market]]. Though the younglings managed to escape the pirates, [[Ahsoka Tano]] was pulled into [[Realspace|space]] along with the pirates because the ''[[Crucible]]'' had managed to get away from the pirates docking station and had created a vacuum.<ref name=\"ATS\">{{TCW|A Test of Strength}}</ref>\n\nGungi and his youngling friends were building their lightsabers as they had free time, due to the fact their ship was stranded. After Gungi, [[Petro]], and [[Byph]] finished their lightsabers the group decided to go to [[Florrum]] to cool their engines (which were at risk of exploding) and to save Ahsoka. Once there, they joined the [[Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder|troupe]] of the [[Dug]] [[Preigo]] to infiltrate the [[Hondo's complex|base]] of Hondo before stealing back [[Ahsoka's lightsabers]], [[Rescue on Florrum|freeing]] Ahsoka and escaping on a stolen [[speeder]].<ref name=\"ANB\">{{TCW|A Necessary Bond}}</ref>\n\n===Battle against Grievous===\nAfter escaping on the stolen speeder, Petro made contact with [[R2-D2]] and Ganodi on board the ''Crucible'', but by the time the ''Crucible'' got to them, the speeder was almost at a ravine. The Jedi had to attempt to board the ship hurriedly, with Gungi and Byph hanging off of the edge of the boarding ramp before the pirates shot a missile at the ship, causing it to crash and the pirates to take them hostage yet again. When they reached Hondo's base they found it was under [[Battle on Florrum|attack]] by [[General]] [[Grievous]] and with the common goal to escape the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]], the Jedi and the pirates worked together freeing Ohnaka and escaped to his secret private fleet before managing to leave Florrum.<ref name=\"Bound for Rescue\" />\n\n===Bombing at the Temple===\nGungi was later seen training outside the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] some [[time]] after the [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing]] of the Temple's [[hangar]]. Along with his [[teacher]], [[Tera Sinube]], Gungi observed as [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Barriss Offee]] [[Duel at the Jedi Temple|dueled]] outside until Offee was apprehended.<ref name=\"TWJ\">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGungi, like many other [[Wookiee]]s, was temperamental and expressive. During his trial at the Gathering, he struggled with the concept of patience, and was only able to acquire his kyber crystal after allowing himself to slow down.<ref name=\"TCW:TG\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nGungi constructed a [[Gungi's lightsaber|lightsaber]] of his own with a wooden hilt that he chose from amongst the ''Crucible''{{'s}} store of materials.<ref name=\"ATS\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|The Gathering (episode)|The Gathering}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|A Test of Strength}}\n*{{TCW|Bound for Rescue}}\n*{{TCW|A Necessary Bond}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=Almost a Jedi|sformatted=Almost a Jedi|book=The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark}}\n*[[The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark (audiobook)|''The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark'' audiobook]]\n*{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}\n*{{TCW|Destiny (episode)|Destiny}} {{Vision|[[Yoda]]}}\n*[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']] {{Imo}}\n*[[Ahsoka (audiobook)|''Ahsoka'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[Pirate's Price]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Pirate's Price (audiobook)|''Pirate's Price'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll box|\n*{{SW|url=explore/the-clone-wars/ep506|text=\"The Gathering\" - ''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide}}\n*{{SW|url=explore/the-clone-wars/ep507/#!/about|text=\"A Test of Strength\" - ''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide}}\n*{{SWE|characters|byph|Byph}}\n*{{SWE|characters|ganodi|Ganodi}}\n*{{SWE|characters|gungi|Gungi}}\n*{{SWE|characters|katooni|Katooni}}\n*{{SWE|characters|petro|Petro}}\n*{{SWE|characters|zatt|Zatt}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Where's the Wookiee? 2]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|31|Databank A-Z|Kaminoans&ndash;King Katuunko}} {{Imo}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|41|Databank A-Z|'Occupier' Tank&ndash;Oola}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|72|Weapons & Uniforms|Training the Jedi}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Where's the Wookiee?
