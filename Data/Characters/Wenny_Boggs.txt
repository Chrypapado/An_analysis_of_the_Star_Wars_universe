While [[Hunting/Legends|hunting]] a herd of [[Womp rat/Legends|womp rats]] one [[Standard day/Legends|day]], Boggs discovered that [[Gender/Legends|he]] had traveled too far into the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] to return home under the safety of [[Star/Legends|daylight]]. Fearing an overnight encounter with a [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] hunting party, Boggs set up camp to await morning. During the night, Boggs was awoken by hauntingly sad [[Music/Legends|singing]], which he soon found to be coming from a [[Unidentified Tusken Raider (singing)|Tusken]] mourning over a [[Death/Legends|dying]] [[Unidentified Tusken Raider (elder)|elder]]. As he witnessed the singing Tusken's anguish over the death of his comrade, Boggs began tearing up, moved by the emotion shown by the normally savage creature. He came to see that the Tuskens were not simply mindless monsters as he had believed.\n\n==Biography==\n===Stranded in the desert===\nWenny Boggs was a young [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]] who resided on the<ref name=\"TSWSB\" /> [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Desert/Legends|desert]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]]<ref name=\"Essential Atlas\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].

Noticing Tatooine's [[Binary star/Legends|twin suns]] rapidly setting in the sky, and wary of the nomadic [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] hunting parties that owned Tatooine's [[Standard day/Legends|night]], Boggs reasoned that it would be safer for him to camp out for the night than risk traveling [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]] of barren sand in the dark. He soon settled into a cranny in a rise of rocky hills, which he found neither roomy nor comfortable, but it provided him a defensible position from which to wait out the night.<ref name=\"TSWSB\" />\n\nArmed with a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]] at his side and stocked with a hunk of [[SoroSuub Insta-Meal]] to sustain himself, Boggs, soothed by the desert darkness and soft sounds of the night, eventually drifted off to [[Sleep/Legends|sleep]], despite his best efforts to stay awake. After a [[Time/Legends|time]], he awoke with a start, having heard [[Music/Legends|singing]] off in the distance, though when the desert night went quiet again, he was unsure if he had simply [[Dream/Legends|dreamed]] the sound. When the singing, a somber chant, started again, echoing over the rocky peaks from behind him, Boggs found himself captivated. Curiosity piqued, he grabbed his [[Rifle/Legends|rifle]] and climbed over the rocks to see the singer.<ref name=\"TSWSB\" />\n\n===Tusken Raider dying ceremony===\n[[File:TuskenTatooine.png|thumb|right|230px|Wenny Boggs' impression of the savage Tusken Raiders changed after he witnessed a Tusken dying ceremony.]]\nAt first, Boggs found only a single [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] waiting at the mouth of a narrow canyon, riderless, though strapped with packs and pouches that clearly belonged to a Tusken Raider. Although no one was in sight, the singing continued, luring Boggs into a series of tall crags at the end of the canyon. He eventually came upon a hollow circle surrounded by high walls of stone, at the center of which lay a flat stone platform, ringed with painted, rocky totems honoring some ancient [[Deity/Legends|gods]]. There, Boggs found his singer, a [[Unidentified Tusken Raider (singing)|Tusken Raider]] bending over an aged, feeble-looking [[Unidentified Tusken Raider (elder)|figure]] resting on the stone platform. The singing Tusken had removed his [[Breath mask/Legends|breathing filter]], and, though Boggs could not see his face, he found the Tusken's unencumbered song surprisingly melancholy and dreamy, not frightening, as he would have imagined.<ref name=\"TSWSB\" />\n\nAs Boggs watched, the aged figure grasped the [[Limb/Legends|hand]] of the singing Tusken and whispered a short series of words into his [[Ear/Legends|ear]] before his own hand fell away and he [[Death/Legends|died]]. The Tusken's song stopped just as quickly, and the creature began wailing in anguished torment over his dead comrade, which echoed through the canyon. Boggs bowed his head as tears came to his [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], never imagining that the hostile Tuskens could feel emotion as he did. Giving a final nod to the expired elder, Boggs quietly returned to his cranny to await the dawn.<ref name=\"TSWSB\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAs one of Tatooine's moisture [[Farmer/Legends|farmers]], Wenny Boggs was duly cautious of the savage Tusken Raiders,<ref name=\"TSWSB\" /> who were notorious for regularly attacking Tatooine's [[Human/Legends|Human]] settlers, isolated moisture [[Farm/Legends|farmers]] included.<ref name=\"TSWSB - Tusken Raiders\">''[[The Star Wars Sourcebook]]''</ref> After Boggs found himself trapped out in the desert with not enough daylight to safely return home, he opted to seek shelter, not wanting to confront a hunting band of the fearsome creatures at night.<ref name=\"TSWSB\" />\n\nBoggs came to reevaluate some of the surface impressions he held of the creatures upon discovering the singing Tusken in mourning over his aged, dying comrade. Boggs was transfixed by the Tusken's song, unable to offer resistance as it pulled him to its source in the Tusken ceremonial rock circle. The Tusken's singing, sad and lilting, belied the creatures' typical growling vocals, which surprised Boggs, who found the singing strangely wistful rather than harsh and frightening, as expected&mdash;of course, he never imagined that Tuskens could sing in the first place. Boggs' most profound revelation came as he witnessed the singing Tusken agonizing over the death of the elder, discovering for himself that Tuskens were not mindless monsters but instead beings of feeling and emotion.<ref name=\"TSWSB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWenny Boggs appeared in the short narrative ''[[Song for a Fallen Nomad]]'', originally published by [[West End Games]] in the [[1987]] ''[[The Star Wars Sourcebook]]'', written by [[Bill Slavicsek]] and [[Curtis Smith]]. The story provides a rare insight into the intimate social rituals of the Tusken Raiders,<ref name=\"TSWSB\" /> who earned a common reputation as savage brutes among Tatooine's other inhabitants.<ref name=\"Tusken Raider Databank\">{{DB|species|tuskenraider|Tusken Raider|archivedate=20101001181545}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Star Wars Sourcebook|story=Song for a Fallen Nomad}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Star Wars Sourcebook (Second Edition)|text=''Star Wars Sourcebook'', Second Edition|story=Song for a Fallen Nomad}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boggs, Wenny}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
