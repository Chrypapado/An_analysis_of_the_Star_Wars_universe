However, instead of taking the opportunity to ambush the crew, Azanti decided to try to intimidate them with threats, stating that Surik was \"a criminal\" and ordering them to surrender her to him.

He was very eager to collect the bounty on the Jedi, and he didn't show much respect to his fellow bounty hunters or to his bounties. This was shown by his actions on the ''Visionary'', when he and his fellow Zhug leader demeaned the other bounty hunters present and openly called G0-T0 mad.
