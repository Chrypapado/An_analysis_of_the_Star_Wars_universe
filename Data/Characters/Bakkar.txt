A big fan of [[podracing]], Bakkar originally [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the planet [[Tatooine]] and came from a [[Bakkar's family|family]] that worked as butchers for four generations. Bakkar opened his restaurant with a goal of bringing his famous [[ronto]] meat to new customers after moving to Batuu with his [[8D-series smelter droid|droid]], [[8D-J8]].\n\nBakkar had an unusual way of grilling his meats, utilizing a [[podracer engine]] that he purchased and modified. In [[34 ABY]], 8D-J8's [[Programmer|reprogramming]] that was intended to make the [[Smelter droid|droid]] man the grill had the side effect of him talking too much; in order to solve the issue, Bakkar contacted the [[Utai]] [[Mubo]]&mdash;8D-J8's original programmer&mdash;who eventually agreed to help fix the droid.\n\n==Biography==\n===Opening a restaurant===\n{{Quote|This human is a fourth-generation butcher from Tatooine who uses the flames from a modified podracer engine to cook up giant hunks of ronto (a pack animal from his planet) to perfection.|Strono Tuggs, ''The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook''|Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook}}\n[[File:RontoRoasters-TGTB.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bakkar opened Ronto Roasters.]]\nBakkar was a fourth-generation butcher who [[Homeworld|grew up]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]],<ref name=\"Cookbook\" /> where [[Gender|his]] [[Bakkar's family|family's]] specialty was the [[ronto]] creature. He was a big fan of the [[podracing]] sport even after it was outlawed across [[the galaxy]].<ref name=\"guide\" /> He sold different kinds of specialty meats, but like his family, ronto was what he was largely known for. He left Tatooine when he came of age, [[dream]]ing of selling his family's famous meat on another [[Outer Rim Territories]] planet.

He also enjoyed watching reruns of races, showcasing his fandom. Due to his being a butcher, Bakkar was aptly nicknamed \"the Butcher.\"<ref name=\"staff\" />\n\n===Best butcher in town===\n{{Quote|You want to sink your teeth into the most delicious meat in the Outer Rim?

Ronto Roasters also sold drinks, with Bakkar's signature beverage being the [[Tatooine Sunset]].<ref name=\"guide\" /> On multiple occasions, the [[Artiodac]] [[chef]] [[Strono Tuggs]] tried to persuade Bakkar to share his family's secret spice rub for Ronto Wraps, but Bakkar always refused. Tuggs respected it being a secret, but he still attempted to make out the recipe for himself.<ref name=\"Cookbook\" />\n\nIn [[34 ABY]],<ref name=\"Cookbook date\">{{CookbookDate}}</ref> Tuggs published a [[Book|cookbook]] titled ''[[The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook]]''.

While Tuggs had initially been wary of using the eopie's tough meat, after sampling a slice of its rump from Bakkar at Ronto Roasters, he was impressed by how tender Bakkar was able to make it as well as how seemingly magical his special seasoning for it was.<ref name=\"Life Day\">''[[Star Wars: The Life Day Cookbook]]''</ref> As with his ronto seasoning,<ref name=\"Cookbook\" /> Bakkar was not quick to share the secret even with a friend such as Tuggs.

Bakkar insisted that another reprogramming was necessary, or he would need to fasten a [[restraining bolt]] onto the droid. Mubo beseeched him not to put a bolt on the pitmaster, but Bakkar pointed out that 8D-J8 needed to stop talking as he had begun thinking himself to be a droid chef despite simply being a pitmaster. Mubo relented, and despite being swamped with orders, he told Bakkar that he would stop by later.<ref name=\"dp\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You gotta reprogram this droid, I can't take it anymore!|Bakkar|:File:DroidProblems1_GEDatapad.png}}\nBakkar had a love for podracing and was willing to talk about it at length,<ref name=\"ge:bs\" /> and displayed boyish passion when watching reruns of the sport.
