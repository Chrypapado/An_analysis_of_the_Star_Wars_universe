Why do the Sith keep bothering us?\u00bb''<br />[Soldier shoots Ixgil] \"''That's how we Sith deal with smart-mouth aliens!|Ixgil's final conversation, with a Sith soldier|noquote=1|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Ixgil''' was a [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived in the [[South Apartments]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. In [[3956 BBY]], the apartments were raided by members of [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]]. When Ixgil complained about the activities of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Unidentified Sith soldier|leader]] of the raiding group shot him, [[Death/Legends|killing]] the Duros instantly. [[Republic soldier]] [[Carth Onasi]] and [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] both witnessed the event and defeated the Sith. Following the skirmish, [[Unidentified Duros (South Apartments)|Ixgil's friend]] hid his corpse to prevent the authorities from learning about the incident.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Right you alien scum, everybody get up against the wall! This is a raid!|Ixgil's killer, a Sith soldier|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nDuring the [[Jedi Civil War]], Ixgil resided in the [[South Apartments]] of the [[Upper City]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] with [[Gender/Legends|his]] [[Unidentified Duros (South Apartments)|friend]], a fellow [[Duros/Legends|Duros]]. During the war, the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]], under the [[Commanding officer/Legends|command]] of [[Darth Malak]], [[Capture of Taris|invaded]] and occupied the planet as part of its war effort against the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />  In [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"EA\" /> upon arriving in the [[Taris system/Legends|Taris system]], the Republic [[Hammerhead-class cruiser|cruiser]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'' was [[Attack on the Endar Spire|ambushed]] in a battle over the planet. Although the [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]] was destroyed, several [[Republic soldier|troops]] were able to survive by fleeing to the surface of the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] in [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]]. Among the survivors were [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] [[Carth Onasi]] and the [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who possessed implanted memories of a Republic soldier. After they crash-landed, the pair took refuge in the Upper City's South Apartments, where Onasi hoped they would not be found by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n[[File:SoldierShootsIxgil.png|thumb|left|250px|A Sith soldier shoots Ixgil.]]\nTo prevent the escape of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Bastila Shan]], who had also fled the ''Endar Spire'', the Sith imposed a planet-wide quarantine and began a search for her. During the occupation, [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith soldiers]] regularly raided and searched the apartments, to the annoyance of the residents. Several [[Standard day/Legends|days]] after the occurrence of the battle overhead, the apartments were the subject of another raid conducted by a [[Unidentified Sith soldier|Human soldier]] and two [[Sentinel droid]]s. When Ixgil complained, the [[Human/Legends|Human]] became enraged and shot him in the chest three times, [[Death/Legends|killing]] Ixgil.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nRevan and Onasi witnessed the event and managed to defeat the Sith raiding party, saving Ixgil's friend. After the fight, Ixgil's friend thanked them and regretted that Ixgil had spoken out against his killers. He later hid the remains of both Ixgil and the Sith to prevent any investigators from learning about the incident, which would have brought about dire consequences for all involved.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Poor Ixgil. He should never have talked back to that Sith.|Ixgil's companion, reflecting on his friend's death|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIxgil was a Duros male and as such had [[Color/Legends|blue]]-green skin, red [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and a hunched posture. He was willing to voice his complaints about the Sith and their disruptive activities despite the fact that it could have seen him arrested, injured, or in his case, killed. He lived in the Upper City despite the [[Humanocentrism|Humanocentric]] views of much of the population that prevented most [[Alien/Legends|non-Humans]] from residing there. Ixgil could understand [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic]] in addition to [[Durese/Legends|Durese]], but spoke the latter.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nIxgil wore a mauve and white tunic with matching pants and a black [[Belt/Legends|belt]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIxgil appears as a non-playable character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', developed by [[BioWare]]. His dialogue is spoken during a cutscene from the viewpoint of the player character, Revan. The cutscene, and hence Ixgil's death, cannot be avoided and occurs regardless of the player character's gender or alignment.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nIn the cutscene on the PC version of the game, the Sith soldier has two lines of dialogue that are pronounced differently than their accompanying subtitles. In the first case, the subtitles say, \"Okay you alien scum,\" but the soldier's voice actor clearly says, \"Right you alien scum.\" In the second case, the subtitles say, \"Hey, what's this?,\" instead of the spoken \"What's this?\" The dialogue and the subtitles match in the original Xbox version, as a different voice recording was used. This article assumes the spoken dialogue of the PC version is correct.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Ixgil}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ixgil\n|es=Ixgil\n|pl=Ixgil\n|ru=\u0418\u043a\u0441\u0433\u0438\u043b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Duros]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
