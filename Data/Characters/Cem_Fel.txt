Raised as a [[shadow child]] first on [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]] and then on [[Csilla/Legends|Csilla]], Fel was kept secret from all those outside the [[Fel dynasty|family]] until [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]], when his name was leaked to a visiting group of [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], information which made its way back to [[Aristocra/Legends|Aristocra]] [[Chaf'orm'bintrano]] of the Chiss in [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I'll see if I can get Father to let me take ''Starflare'', our family yacht.

As a shadow child, Fel was kept completely unknown to the public, so that if ever the [[Fel dynasty|family]] were destroyed by enemies, Cem could keep the Fel line alive. His brothers [[Chak Fel|Chak]], [[Davin Fel|Davin]], and [[Jagged Fel|Jagged]] all went into the Empire of the Hand's military, as did his sister, [[Cherith Fel|Cherith]]. All of those except Jagged were [[Death/Legends|lost]] in combat relatively early in Fel's life. His sister [[Wynssa Fel|Wynssa]], however, remained at home with him. While he did not appear in public, Fel was taught to [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and frequently took out the family [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] ''[[Starflare]]'', which annoyed the eager-to-pilot Wynssa.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /><ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\nWhen the Empire of the Hand ceased to exist and the Fels joined the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]], Fel returned to Csilla and settled there with his family, where he remained a secret. In [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]], however, his existence was outed to the visiting [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] by Wynssa.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> This information did not make it back to the Chiss until [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]], when Solo's uncle and aunt [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] dropped his name in conversation with [[Aristocra/Legends|Aristocra]] [[Chaf'orm'bintrano]] of the Chiss, who quickly realized that Fel was a shadow child and promised to keep his existence secret. He speculated that the namedrop by Wynssa had possibly been part of a plot by Soontir.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nIn [[36 ABY]], the Fels were dishonored and diminished in power by the actions of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Lowbacca]], taken after Jagged granted his parole as an [[Officer/Legends|officer]] of the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]]; at the same time, Jagged was himself lost to a crash on [[Tenupe]].<ref name=\"The Swarm War\">''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]''</ref> While Jagged was recovered two years later, he was exiled, never to be able to return.<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref> It was only in [[40 ABY]], with the death of the Chiss enemy [[Alema Rar]] at Jagged's hands, that the family's honor was restored.<ref name=\"Fury\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCem Fel has only been mentioned by other characters, first in ''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]'' and then in ''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''; he has never appeared as a character himself.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /><ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\n''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'', published in [[2000]], and ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'', published in [[2002]], established five Fel siblings&mdash;Jagged, his older deceased brother Davin, his younger deceased sister Cherith, and two other unnamed children.<ref name=\"Ruin\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" >''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]''</ref> ''Force Heretic II: Refugee'', published in [[2003]], filled in the missing two as Cem and Wynssa.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /> All five children had been named when Chak Fel appeared in ''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' in [[2004]]. This information was [[retcon]]ned in ''Dark Nest I: The Joiner King'', which established that Cem had been a shadow child known to none outside the family; all references to five Fel children were therefore misinformation and included Chak, Davin, Jagged, Cherith, and Wynssa.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /> ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', published in [[2008]], confirmed what had only been expressed as characters' belief by explicitly establishing him as Cem Fel, a shadow child of the Fel family.<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" />\n\n''The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia'' also stated that Fel was born on Csilla. As his family did not join the Chiss Ascendancy and move to Csilla until shortly before he was old enough to pilot yachts, Fel must have been born on the world before his family took up residence there.<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]'' {{1stID}}\n*''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*{{FFCite|122|WYN1, ''Wynssa Starflare''}}\n*{{FFCite|140|FEL2, ''Baron Soontir Fel''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2011 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 6|cardname=Shea Standefer sketch cards}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Cem Fel\n|ru=\u041a\u0435\u043c \u0424\u0435\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fel, Cem}}\n[[Category:Csillans]]\n[[Category:Empire of the Hand citizens]]\n[[Category:Fel family]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nirauan residents]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
