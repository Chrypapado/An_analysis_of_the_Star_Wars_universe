I'm not a brat.|Valin Horn|The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream}}\n'''Valin Horn''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], the son of [[Corran Horn]] and [[Mirax Terrik Horn]], and the older brother of [[Jysella Horn]]. In [[43 ABY]] he became one of the first Jedi to become infected with [[Force psychosis]], resulting in his encasement in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and Yuuzhan Vong War===\nValin of the [[Horn family]] was named for his paternal grandfather [[Hal Horn|Valin Halcyon]], was born about four years after [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] [[Thrawn campaign|campaign]] against the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. He was musically inclined and could often be found playing his [[chordokeylo]]. A [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], he eventually attended [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] to train as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].\n\nHorn developed skills similar to those of [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], particularly his [[Animal bond|affinity with animals]]. Around the age of eleven, he found he could communicate with animals through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. However, like his father and grandfather before him, he was weak in the art of [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]]. In one instance, since Valin could not lift a stone using telekinesis, he instead used the Force to persuade small insects called [[garnant]]s to move a stone for him by convincing them it was food. His father saw the stone move and thought Valin had used telekinesis until the younger Horn explained his method. He brought food for the garnants and left it for them before leaving, keeping his promise of food for them.\n\nDuring the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Horn was trapped on Yavin 4 with the other Praxeum students when the [[Peace Brigade]] blockaded the [[Yavin system/Legends|system]]. Fortunately, Horn, [[Sannah]] and [[Kam Solusar]] managed to survive long enough to escape during [[Anakin Solo]]'s risky mission to save the trapped [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].<ref name=\"Conquest\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]''</ref> Horn then spent some time training with the remaining Jedi initiates onboard his maternal grandfather [[Booster Terrik]]'s ship ''[[Errant Venture]]''.<ref>''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''</ref>\n[[File:Njo_valinhorn.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jedi Apprentice Valin Horn during the Yuuzhan Vong War.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]], he and the other Jedi children were sent to [[the Maw]] for safety for the remainder of the war.<ref>''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref> At the end of the conflict, Horn traveled to [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]] for [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] Skywalker's [[Conclave on Zonama Sekot|meeting]] with the surviving Jedi.<ref>''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref>\n\n===Second Galactic Civil War===\n{{Quote|You're a fraction the man your father is.''\"<br />\"''Funny. That's what I was going to say to you.|[[Darth Caedus]] and Valin Horn|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nBy the time of the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], Horn was performing missions for the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]], and from his age he would be presumed to have reached the rank of Jedi Knight. As conflict developed against his ancestral [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], Grand Master Luke Skywalker ensured that his duties kept him well away from anywhere that his loyalties might be tested.\n\nDuring a mission in the underlevels of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], accompanied by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kyle Katarn]], fellow Jedi Knights [[Thann Mithric]] and [[Kolir Hu'lya]], and Jedi apprentice [[Seha Dorvald]], Horn and the group came into confrontation with Jacen Solo. During the ensuing battle, Katarn was severely wounded after being stabbed in the chest by Solo, forcing Horn and Dorvald to remove him from the fight which culminated in the death of Mithric.\n\nHorn later participated in the operation to destroy [[Centerpoint Station]], disguising himself as a [[Galactic Alliance Guard]] trooper alongside fellow Jedi, including [[Kyp Durron]] and [[Jaden Korr]].\n\n===A new menace===\n{{Quote|Jedi Horn! Is it true you're on a destructive rampage?|[[Galaxy 9 News]] reporter to Valin Horn|Fate of the Jedi: Outcast}}\nIn [[43 ABY|43.5 ABY]], Valin Horn was suddenly possessed with an enigmatic [[Force psychosis|madness]] that caused him to believe that everyone he knew had been replaced by impostors. His psychosis making him believe they were impostors, he attacked his own parents, but was captured by them and taken to the [[New Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] to be evaluated. He broke free, however, and became a fugitive of the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]], making [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Natasi Daala]] even more distrustful towards the Jedi. After a long manhunt, he was caught by Luke Skywalker and placed in the [[Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center]], and later moved back to the [[Jedi Temple Detention Center#Asylum Block|Asylum Block]].<ref name=\"Outcast\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref>\n\nEventually, Daala released a warrant for Horn, and he was arrested by [[Galactic Alliance Security]] forces under [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Oric Harfard]], and put on [[The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances versus Valin Horn|trial]]. He was found incapable of standing trial, but too dangerous to be kept in a conventional prison, so he was encased in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and placed in the [[Armand Isard Correctional Facility]]. A [[Raid on the Armand Isard Correctional Facility|rescue attempt]] to free Horn was made by rogue Jedi [[Seff Hellin]], who was suffering from the same disease, believing that Horn was the only one he knew that wasn't replaced by an imposter. It was unsuccessful, however, and resulted in Hellin's capture by [[Darkmeld]], a covert organization formed by Jedi Knight [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] to counter Daala's efforts to undermine the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nAt some point following the failed rescue attempt, Valin was transferred, along with his sister to the [[Palem Graser Office Tower]],<ref name=\"Allies\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]''</ref> a secret GAS safehouse under the command of [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Wruq Retk]] and operating under the guise of [[Galactic Alliance Storage]]. The Jedi Order obtained a writ granting them visitation rights to the siblings, along with an incarceration order providing their location. After a brief attempt to turn away the visitation group, which included Corran and Mirax Horn, the GAS officers directed the Jedi to the siblings' location. The Jedi, and the many HoloNet Reporters that had rushed in as well, were abhorred to learn that Valin and Jysella were being hung as decoration in the executive offices. When Colonel Retk entered the room, he engaged in a short conversation with Mirax Horn before she knocked the [[Yaka]] unconscious. The entire incident was an embarrassment to the GA Government, with Daala promising to ensure that the carbonite frozen siblings would be treated with dignity.<ref name=\"Abyss\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss]]''</ref> After being freed from his carbonite prison, Valin and his sister were still inflicted with the Force psychosis. He was able to conceal his condition, being more in control of his emotions and suspicions than he was previously.<ref>''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I'd been trying to move the rock with my mind for a while first. Then I decided to try that other way. I guess I'll never be a powerful Jedi.\"<br>\"There are those among the Jedi that view strength as how far you can move something, or how easily you can break something. The real strength of a Jedi comes from within, from his heart and mind. Some Jedi move rocks just to prove that they can move them, but the strongest Jedi don't see any reason to move rocks when that isn't going to solve the immediate problem.|Valin Horn (age 11) and [[Corran Horn|his father]]|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught}}\nIn his youth, Valin Horn was a follower and wanted to be a hero. He wanted to be a Jedi as powerful as Anakin Solo, which got him and a few other young Jedi into a lot of trouble when Solo came to Yavin 4 to rescue [[Tahiri Veila]].<ref name=\"Conquest\" />\n\nLike his father, he was lacking in telekinesis, but he made up for it with his [[Animal bond|affinity with animals]]. At one point his father Corran Horn said he was proud of him when he thought Valin had \"lifted\" a rock a minuscule height off the ground. In actuality Valin had made a nest of garnants think the rock was food. A few seconds later [[Ganner Rhysode]] showed up and implied that all Valin would be was a failure, and Valin made the garnants think he was food. In a way, Valin had made Rhysode eat his words. He once again manipulated insect life when he was being held for observation in the [[Jedi Temple]] after he exhibited traits of a mysterious illness. He successfully called the bugs to him through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and had them chew through the restraints on his medical bed in order to escape.\n\nAs a man, as reflected upon by his sister Jysella, Valin was level-headed and easy going. She also described him as gentle. The Solos commented that both Valin and Jysella were well liked within the Jedi community.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Vision}}\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Union]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''\n*''[[Crosscurrent]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Omen'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss]]'' {{C|Appears frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]]}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Abyss'' audiobook]] {{C|Appears frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]]}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Backlash'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Allies'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex]]'' {{C|Appears frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]]}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Vortex'' audiobook]] {{C|Appears frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]]}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|57|Who's Who in the New Jedi Order}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|90|HOR4, ''Corran Horn''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Dramatis Personae]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|109|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*{{Topps|set=2011 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 6|cardname=Shea Standefer sketch cards}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Valin Horn\n|de=Valin Horn\n|es=Valin Horn\n|ja=\u30f4\u30a1\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30db\u30fc\u30f3\n|pl=Valin Horn\n|ru=\u0412\u044d\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043d\n|plFA=1\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horn, Valin}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Galactic Alliance individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Coalition personnel]]\n[[Category:Jedi Knights of the New Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
