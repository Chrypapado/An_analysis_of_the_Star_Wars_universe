He often spent time with Luke at [[Tosche Station/Legends|Tosche Station]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:AtTheVaporator-SWIANH.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Windy mocks his friend Luke Skywalker about his dream to join the Imperial Academy.]]\nWindy was usually seen in the company of his friend [[Deacon|Deak]], who continually followed him around [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. Another [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] acquaintance, [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]], once characterized Windy as \"a follower\" and called Deak \"a follower of a follower.\"<ref name=\"SWradio\">[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]]</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right\">[[File:Windy_Galaxy_2.jpg|thumb|Windy in 0 BBY]]</div>\n\nWindy's parents would sometimes visit [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke's]] [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|aunt]] and [[Owen Lars/Legends|uncle]] at the [[Lars homestead]]. When they were thirteen, Luke and Windy became lost in the desert and found themselves face to face with a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|Krayt dragon]]. They were rescued by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], whom they only knew as hermit Ben Kenobi. When Windy and Luke were brought back safely to the Lars homestead by the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Owen angrily chased Kenobi away.<ref name=\"adventurebeggars\">''[[Adventure in Beggar's Canyon]]''</ref><ref name=\"lswalkabout\">''[[Luke Skywalker's Walkabout]]''</ref>\n{{Talesstart}}\nWindy and Deak were present when Luke was challenged to a speeder race by a local braggart, [[Gorm Maldorf]], in [[The Cage]]. He warned Luke that Maldorf was dangerous, but he accepted the challenge. On the morning of the race, Gorm was found [[Death/Legends|dead]], strangled, in The Cage. After Windy and Deak helped him make his escape, Luke investigated the death and deduced that Gorm had been accidentally killed while trying to sabotage the race the night before.<ref name=\"lsdetective\">{{Tales|20|Luke Skywalker: Detective}}</ref>\n{{Talesend}}\n[[File:Windyadult.jpg|thumb|left|Windy in his late teens]]\nBy their late teens, the friends were part of a group of youths that included Biggs Darklighter, [[Janek Sunber|Janek \"Tank\" Sunber]], [[Laze Loneozner/Legends|Laze \"Fixer\" Loneozner]], and his girlfriend [[Camie Loneozner|Camie]]. The teens spent time hanging around at [[Tosche Station/Legends|Tosche Station]] in Anchorhead, and raced their [[T-16 skyhopper/Legends|skyhoppers]] for fun.<ref name=\"SWradio\" /><ref name=\"RS3\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''</ref>\n\nWhen Biggs was accepted into the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]], the friends and other locals threw him a party that was broken up by attacking [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand people]].<ref name=\"mc17\">[[Star Wars (1977) 17|''Star Wars'' (1977) 17]]</ref>\n\nWindy would often serve as a foil to Luke's dreams of leaving Tatooine to join the Academy. Once, when Windy found Luke replaying a Space Academy Recruitment tape for a countless time, he told his friend that he should grow up and be content with the life of a [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]].<ref name=\"SWJ\">''[[Star Wars Journal: The Fight for Justice]]''</ref>\n\nSometime later, just before the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] was captured by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] above Tatooine, Luke challenged Fixer to a dangerous skyhopper race through [[Beggar's Canyon/Legends|Beggar's Canyon]] and through the eye of the [[Stone Needle/Legends|Stone Needle]]. Windy flew along with Luke during the race, squealing with fear the whole time. He was frightened by Skywalker's reckless flying and called him \"crazy.\"<ref name=\"SWradio\" /><ref name=\"SWJ\" />\n\nWindy last saw Luke on the morning Biggs confided in Luke about his plans to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. Windy, along with the rest of his friends, told Luke that he did not believe he had actually seen a [[Battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|firefight]] in the skies above Tatooine.<ref name=\"SWradio\" /><ref name=\"SWJ\" />\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction of the first]] [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Windy could still be found in Anchorhead. While here, he asked a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to find a wanted murderer named [[Blix Lanister]], who had fled town.<ref name=\"SWG\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''</ref>\n\nWindy saw Luke again when he returned briefly to Tatooine when he was trying to hide from [[X-7]].<ref name=\"RF:R\">''[[Rebel Force: Renegade]]''</ref>\n{{Gamemechanics}}\n[[File:WindomStarkiller.jpg|thumb|right|Windy around [[1 ABY/Legends|1.5 ABY]]]]\nThe spacer agreed to carry out the task, and found Blix shortly thereafter. Blix was brought back to Windy, who paid the spacer 30 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] in thanks. He even said the spacer should consider a career as a security officer. Yet the situation with Blix did not end there. Windy also wanted the spacer to find one of Blix's gang members, a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] named [[Gleezwuq]]. Gleezwuq was the only member of Blix's gang whose whereabouts Windy did not know. He was sure that Gleezwuq would have evidence which would implicate Blix in his murder of [[Alita Sweetwater]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nThe spacer managed to find the Rodian gang member, and killed him. On Gleezwuq's person was the same [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] that Blix used in his murder of Alita. The spacer brought the blaster back to an impressed Windy, who was now certain that Blix could be brought to justice. The spacer was once again awarded another 30 credits. However, shortly after the evidence was brought to Windy, Blix's cohorts came into town and helped Blix escape Anchorhead. Windy tasked the spacer with one final task, which was to find Blix and his cronies. Windy did not believe that Blix would let himself be brought back alive again. He told the spacer to do what was necessary. Ultimately, the spacer found Blix, and killed him and the other thugs. Following the successful operation, Windy awarded the spacer 100 credits. Sometime following this event, Windy left Anchorhead.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:FemaleWindy.jpg|thumb|left|Windy depicted as a girl instead of as a boy in ''[[Luke's Fate]]'', unlike all of his other appearances.]]\nWindy is barely glimpsed in the background of the Tosche Station scene [[Scenes cut from Star Wars#Episode IV - A New Hope|cut]] from [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']]. The scene is included the Blu-Ray release. His character is expanded upon in the [[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]], where he gets several lines of dialogue.\n\nWindy appears briefly in a training level of the video game ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'', voiced by [[Andrew Chaikin]].\n\nIn the original version of ''[[Luke Skywalker's Walkabout]]'', Windy is referred to as both Windom Starkiller and Windy Marstrap. One can assume that Windy is short for Windom. [[Leland Chee]] has stated that his last name is Marstrap in the [[Holocron continuity database]].<ref name=\"Holocron\">{{Cite_web|url=http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&start=1335|title=Star Wars: Message Boards: Holocron continuity database questions|author=Leland Chee|quote=Windy's last name is Marstrap. That's about all I've got.|archivedate=20090604132018}}</ref> However, in the colored reprint for ''[[Star Wars: Luke Skywalker, Last Hope for the Galaxy]]'', Windy's last name has been corrected, and he is named Starkiller both times. Confusing things further, an action figure released by [[Hasbro Inc.|Hasbro]] in 2010 gave Windy's friend Camie the last name \"Marstrap.\"\n\n''[[Adventure in Beggar's Canyon]]'' and ''[[Luke Skywalker's Walkabout]]'' were both suggested by a single line of dialogue from Luke in the ''Star Wars'' radio drama. The two stories are variations on the same premise.\n\nIn \"[[Luke Skywalker: Detective]],\" the artist makes Windy and Deak virtually identical, and it's never identified which character is which.\n\nIn the [[Wikipedia:MMORPG|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', Windy was named Windom Starkiller and could be found as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in a tent in Anchorhead. Players who performed a series of [[:w:c:Quest|quests]] for Windy had to escort Blix Lanister to Anchorhead, kill Gleezwuq outside [[City/Legends|town]], and then kill Lanister when he escaped from Anchorhead. The series of quests involved implicating Blix Lanister in the murder of Alita Sweetwater. During the second quest, Windom Starkiller would ask the player to call him \"Windy.\" In the [[Video game|game]], Windy had [[Color/Legends|blond]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] with brown [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. For unknown reasons, Windy was removed from ''Star Wars Galaxies'' less than a year after its release, during [[:w:c:swg:Publish 6 Notes:11 February 04|Publish 6]] on [[February 11]], [[2004]]. Although the player could choose not to do Windy's quests, this article assumes 100% game completion.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nIn the book ''[[Luke's Fate]]'' by [[Jim Thomas]], Windy is depicted as a young girl, in contrast with his usual masculine representation and pronouns.\n\n\"Windy\" was the name of a character in early versions of the ''Star Wars'' script. The first iteration of Windy was as \"[[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windy]],\" a Jedi, in the ''[[Journal of the Whills, Part I]]''. In the [[The Star Wars: Rough Draft|rough draft]], Windy becomes the son of [[King/Legends|King]] [[Kayos]] and brother of Biggs and [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]]. In the [[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars|second draft]], Windy, with Biggs, his twin, is a younger brother of Luke Starkiller. They are definitively excised from Luke's family tree in the [[The Star Wars: From The Adventures of Luke Starkiller|third draft]], where they first become Luke's friends at the power station.<ref>''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|20|Luke Skywalker: Detective}}\n*''[[Luke Skywalker's Walkabout]]''\n*''[[Adventure in Beggar's Canyon]]''\n*''[[Luke's Fate]]''\n*[[Empire 8|''Empire'' 8]]\n*[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]]\n*''[[Star Wars Journal: The Fight for Justice]]''\n*[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' novel]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{C|Deleted scene}}\n*''[[Rebel Force: Renegade]]''\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 17|''Star Wars'' (1977) 17]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{C|Identified as Windom Starkiller}}\n*''[[The Life and Legend of Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]'' {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|35|Anchorhead: The Lost Scenes}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided Quick Reference Guide]]'' {{C|as Windom Starkiller}}\n*''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|berulars|Lars, Beru|archivedate=20110517074258}}\n*{{DB|character|owenlars|Lars, Owen|archivedate=20110517075555}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2013 Topps Star Wars Illustrated: A New Hope|cardname=At the Vaporator|link=https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/87473/cid/6296468/2013-Topps-Star-Wars-Illustrated-A-New-Hope-1-At-the-Vaporator|archivedate=20210908160105}}\n*{{Topps|set=2013 Topps Star Wars Illustrated: A New Hope|cardname=Threading the Stone Needle|link=https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/87473/cid/6296470/2013-Topps-Star-Wars-Illustrated-A-New-Hope-3-Threading-the-Stone-Needle|archivedate=20210908161129}}\n*{{Topps|set=2013 Topps Star Wars Illustrated: A New Hope|cardname=Back at Tosche Station|link=https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/87473/cid/6296469/2013-Topps-Star-Wars-Illustrated-A-New-Hope-2-Back-at-Tosche-Station|archivedate=20210908160720}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Windy Starkiller\n|es=Windy Starkiller\n|nl=Windom Starkiller\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Starkiller, Windy}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
