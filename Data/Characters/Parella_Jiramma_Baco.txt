Considered an oddity among the Hutts, Parella was athletic and had a passion for [[Hunting/Legends|hunting]], and he went on a number of big game expeditions. At some point, he journeyed to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Lowick/Legends|Lowick]] on a quest to hunt a [[Unidentified Gorach artist|lone member]] of the [[Gorach]] [[Species/Legends|species]], a legendary race of warriors that were said to have [[Gorach ascension|conquered]] a number of worlds thousands of [[Standard year/Legends|years]] earlier. After locating the being with the help of some [[Droid/Legends|droid]] drones and his [[Pa'lowick/Legends|Pa'lowick]] guide [[Kashina Furt]], Parella pursued and eventually defeated the Gorach.\n\nLater, Parella attended a party on Nar Shaddaa that was held in [[Popara's penthouse|the penthouse]] of his rival and occasional business partner, [[Popara Anjiliac Diresto|Popara Anjiliac]]. However, during the event, Popara was [[Death/Legends|murdered]] and the [[Anjiliac]] patriarch's heir [[Zonnos Anjiliac Priare|Zonnos]] declared that the [[Jedi archivist/Legends|Jedi archivist]] [[Mander Zuma]] and the [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] [[Eddey Be'ray]] and [[Reen Irana]] were responsible for the crime. Eager to endear himself to Zonnos, Parella set out to hunt down the purported [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]], and he confronted them on a bridge on Nar Shaddaa, where the Hutt engaged in a fight with Zuma and initially disorientated the Jedi. However, Zuma regained his composure and sliced through one of the bridge's support cables, which caused the structure to collapse and sent Parella tumbling into a chasm below.\n\n==Biography==\n===Hunting the Gorach===\n{{Quote|I will bring him to heel, and place his stuffed and preserved form in my hall.

Parella was a long time rival of [[Popara Anjiliac Diresto]], the patriarch of the rival [[Anjiliac]] kajidic, and on occasion, Parella acted as a business partner of Popara.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" />\n\nA keen [[Hunting/Legends|hunter]], Parella participated in a number of big game safaris.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> At some point, the Hutt set out to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Lowick/Legends|Lowick]], on a quest to hunt down a [[Unidentified Gorach artist|surviving member]] of the legendary [[Gorach]] [[Species/Legends|species]]. The Gorach were said to be savage warriors that had [[Gorach ascension|subjugated]] dozens of worlds millennia earlier, and Parella suspected that sightings of a \"swamp ape\" on Lowick were that of a Gorach. He sought to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the Gorach, then have its remains stuffed and subsequently put on display in his residence as a piece of art. Arriving on Lowick, Parella landed his [[Parella's starship|starship]] in the world's swamps and logged his mission objectives with a [[Holorecorder/Legends|holorecorder]]. He then donned a set of [[Ruusan copper]] battle [[Armor/Legends|armor]], and after disembarking from the [[Starship/Legends|ship]], he was greeted by [[Kashina Furt]], a [[Pa'lowick/Legends|Pa'lowick]] from a nearby [[City/Legends|settlement]] who had been dispatched to act as Parella's official guide. Parella explained to Furt the legend of the Gorach, and he then commenced the hunt.<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" />\n\n[[File:Parella_and_Kashina.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Parella and Kashina Furt, while hunting the Gorach]]\nParella sent out some [[Droid/Legends|droid]] drones to fire [[incendiary dart]]s into the surrounding swamps, believing that the carpet bombing would drive out the Gorach. He observed the various animals that ran from the [[Fire/Legends|flames]], and as he had predicted, he sighted the Gorach fleeing among them. However, the Gorach realized that it was being hunted and it bolted to Parella's right, along the line of flames. Parella and Furt set off in pursuit, and as they tracked the Gorach, the being ambushed them and briefly engaged Parella in combat, then fled. During the bout, the Gorach drove a [[Spear/Legends|spear]] into Parella's armor, causing it to crack.<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" />\n\nAfter continuing on over a series of hills, Parella and Furt located the Gorach's lair, next to a cliff. There, Parella tossed his Pa'lowick guide inside to test whether there were any traps inside the [[Cave/Legends|cavern]]. Before he could check to see Furt's fate, the Hutt was attacked by the Gorach once again, and the being drove Parella off of a cliff, into a mud pool below. After shedding his helmet to distract the Gorach, Parella stabbed the creature with the [[Vibrobayonet/Legends|vibrobayonet]] affixed to his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and killed it. After he pulled himself out of the pool, Parcella dressed the body of the Gorach, dragged it back to his ship, and placed the corpse into a [[Stasis chamber/Legends|stasis chamber]]. As Parella was about to detail the outcome of the hunt with his holorecorder, he was interrupted by the arrival of Furt, who had discovered in the Gorach's cave that the creature had been a skilled [[Artist/Legends|artist]], not a warrior. Parella returned to his ship, and after thinking about the artist and its fate, he decided not to detail the outcome of the quest with the holorecorder.<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" />\n\n===The death of Popara===\n[[File:Hutt_Armor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Parella, clad in his set of Hutt battle armor]]\n{{Quote|Flee you cowards!

After being informed of their location by the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] [[Min Gost]], Parella cornered the trio next to a bridge. As he emerged onto the structure, the Hutt shouted at the threesome and urged them to flee, so as not to make the hunt too easy for him. Zuma rose to the Hutt's challenge and attacked Parella, and he attempted to slice through the Hutt's [[Stun baton/Legends|stun baton]]. However, the Jedi was unable to do so because the baton was constructed from [[Mandalorian iron]], a lightsaber-resistant material. Zuma subsequently jumped on Parella and tried to [[Shiak|stab]] the Hutt in the [[Eye/Legends|eye]], but the Jedi was electrocuted by the defensive systems fitted to Parella's armor. When Zuma charged at Parella once more, the Hutt attempted to parry Zuma's lightsaber with his baton, but the Jedi evaded Parella's strike and severed one of the bridge's support cables. The other support cables started to snap and Parella attempted to grab onto Zuma, but he failed and the bridge collapsed, which sent Parella tumbling off into a canyon that lay between the surrounding buildings.<ref name=\"Scourge\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I am Kashina Furt, I assume you are Parella the Hutt?''\"<br />\"''Parella the ''Hunter''. When I am on the hunt, I prefer that sobriquet.|Kashina Furt and Parella|Hunting the Gorach}}\nParella was a viperous and ill-tempered individual who was viewed by those around him to be nasty and unpleasant. Considered an oddity among the Hutts, Parella was athletic and had a passion for hunting, and he was as excessive a hunter as most other Hutts were excessively lazy. He took pleasure from stalking and killing his prey, and he preferred hunting [[whirlbat]]s on the adopted Hutt [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] rather than attending parties.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> Parella believed that easy kills were unworthy of his hunting efforts;<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" /> the longer that his quarry evaded him, the more tenacious he became, and he sometimes developed a genuine affection for his prey.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> He liked to regale other Hutts with stories of his hunting expeditions,<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" /> and while most Hutts considered Parella's direct approach to combat to be distasteful, they accepted that his methods were effective, because Parella's rivals often ended up dead at his hands.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> When on hunting expeditions, Parella liked to be known by the sobriquet \"Parella the Hunter.\"<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" />\n\nWhile traveling, Parella journeyed alone and relied upon his own combat abilities to protect himself. He had few qualms about firing blasters into crowds or causing damage to buildings, and he believed in the superiority of Hutts over other [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] species.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> He also had little regard for the safety of those who served him, and during his expedition to hunt the Gorach he was happy to risk the life of his Pa'lowick guide Kashina Furt.<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" /> Despite being a business rival of Popara, Parella loved and respected the Anjiliac patriarch, due to Popara's honest nature. However, he also thought Popara to be old and weak, and felt that the elder Hutt should seek to discover the makers of the drug [[Tempest (spice)|Tempest]]&mdash;a potent variety of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] that had became popular across [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]]&mdash;and to make a deal with them.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> Parella had [[Color/Legends|brown]]-colored skin and orange eyes.<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:Parella's_helmet.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The helmet from Parella's set of Ruusan copper armor, penetrated by one of the spears of the Gorach]]\n{{Quote|He likes weapons of all sorts.

He was proficient in the use of both blasters and melee weapons,<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> and he carried a variety of weapons aboard his starship, including [[Blaster pistol/Legends|pistols]], [[Blaster carbine/Legends|carbines]] and [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]].<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" /> When hunting, he usually carried a [[Force pike/Legends|force pike]], and while pursuing Be'ray, Irana, and Zuma, he wielded a [[Stun/Legends|stun]] baton constructed from [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Iron/Legends|iron]].<ref name=\"Scourge\" /> In addition, he often used tracking droids to help him to locate his prey.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" />\n\nDuring his quest to hunt the Gorach, Parella wore a set of protective armor that was constructed from [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]] [[Copper/Legends|copper]], which included a heavy helmet that was fitted with a [[Heads-up display/Legends|heads-up display]] system. However, he found the armor to be insufficient for his purposes during the expedition, because the Gorach was able to penetrate the helmet with a spear.<ref name=\"Hunting the Gorach\" /> He subsequently acquired a suit of ancient Hutt battle armor, a relic from generations past, and Parella claimed that it was the last such set of armor in existence. The armor significantly enhanced Parella's combat abilities, and it consisted of a woven undersuit and a series of ornate, overlapping<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> [[Durasteel/Legends|durasteel]]<ref name=\"Scourge\" /> plates that were connected to the undersuit to provide protection. Attached to the plates were a number of [[Repulsorlift/Legends|microrepulsors]],<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> which, in addition to some small [[wheel]]s that were fitted to the edge of the suit,<ref name=\"Scourge\" /> allowed Parella to move with speed. The plates could also change color to blend into the surrounding environment. The armor was fitted with built-in [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blasters]] and a specially-designed [[E-Web heavy repeating blaster]] that was fitted to the right shoulder. An on-board [[Computer/Legends|computer]] controlled the armor's various electrical systems, which included a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]], a translation unit and a [[Vocabulator/Legends|vocabulator]].<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> The armor also possessed a defensive capability whereby it electrocuted any of Parella's opponents that touched it.<ref name=\"Scourge\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Of the Hutts in the book, I would say I like Parella the best&mdash;if only because he seeks out new experiences, but never really learns from them.|Jeff Grubb, in an interview regarding ''Scourge''|url=http://fangirlblog.com/interviews/jeff-grubb}}\nParella was created by [[Jeff Grubb]] and [[Owen K.C.

However, ''Scourge'' established the canonical series of events<ref name=\"Scourge\" /> and thus rendered some of the possible [[Roleplaying game|role-playing]] outcomes from ''Tempest Feud'' as non-canon. In ''Tempest Feud'', it was possible for Parella to block the doorway to Popara's penthouse in the aftermath of the elder Hutt's demise, and for him to attack the player characters there. It was also possible for the player characters to subsequently travel to Parella's tower, and if they did so, he greeted them in his full battle armor and attacked them alongside his Klatooinian bodyguards.<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" />\n\nIt was later possible in ''Tempest Feud'' for Parella to attack the players outside the [[Dark Melody]] [[Tapcafe/Legends|tapcafe]] on Nar Shaddaa, and also for him to engage the players in combat for a second time later in the adventure, possibly by hiring the Rodians of the [[Bomu Clan]] to track the players down. A major plot point of ''Tempest Feud'' hinged on Mika's production of the spice Tempest, and if the players killed Mika early in the adventure, it was advised that Parella could then seize control of Mika's Tempest [[Tempest (starship)|manufacturing plant]] on the world [[Varl/Legends|Varl]] and fulfill Mika's role for the rest if the adventure. In addition, the adventure suggested that Parella could be involved in future role-playing adventures, whereby he sought revenge against the player characters. In ''Tempest Feud'', it was possible for Parella to be killed by the player characters<ref name=\"Tempest Feud\" /> and in ''Scourge'', Parella was last seen plummeting into a deep chasm, but the novel did not clarify whether he survived the fall.<ref name=\"Scourge\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|133|Hunting the Gorach}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=Hunting the Gorach|book=Star Wars Insider: The Fiction Collection Volume 1}}\n*[[Scourge (novel)|''Scourge'']]\n*''[[Tempest Feud]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20020328dtfgallery|text=Larger Than Life and Twice As Ugly|int=Larger Than Life and Twice As Ugly|archivedate=20090926191431}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jiramma Baco, Parella}}\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Hutts of the Jiramma clan]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
