From birth she was trained to join the [[Chalactan Adepts/Legends|Chalactan Adepts]] however she was drawn away by a love of [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]].\n\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] she became a [[Rebel pilot/Legends|pilot]] for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], where she performed with enough skill and was deemed trustworthy enough to be selected by [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] to be part of a [[Stealth Squadron|team]] to uncover a mole within the alliance. The team worked entirely off the books, with only [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] knowing of their existence outside of the team's members. As well as discovering the mole they were also tasked with finding a suitable planet on which the alliance could set up a new base.\n\nDuring the group's training, Prithi became attracted to one of her fellow pilots, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and the two began a relationship. Their fraternizing was a concern to Leia Organa, who eventually grounded the both of them for conduct detrimental to the team. However, Prithi and Skywalker redeemed themselves by rescuing their team from an Imperial ambush, and they were restored to full status.\n\nPrithi was involved in a covert mission to the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]], [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']], but her devotion to Skywalker compromised the mission, when she refused to leave her comrades when they took too long infiltrating the vessel. Skirting protocols to prevent Imperials from following her, she executed a single [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace jump]] back to the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Rebel fleet]], leading an Imperial force back to the Rebellion. Although the Alliance was able to ward off the attack, Prithi decided to abandon the Rebellion and return to Chalacta.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I know you went against your parents' wishes and abandoned your theological studies on Chalacta to join the Alliance&hellip;|Leia Organa|Star Wars (2013) 3}}\nPrithi was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Chalacta/Legends|Chalacta]]<ref name=\"SW2\" /> to two parents that wished for her to pursue theological studies and become a [[Chalactan Adepts/Legends|Chalactan Adept]].<ref name=\"SW3\">[[Star Wars (2013) 3|''Star Wars'' (2013) 3]]</ref> Although she had been born with a measure of [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]], Prithi was eventually declared unfit by the order. This was due to her poor concentration, owing to her belief that she was destined for a greater purpose away from Chalacta.<ref name=\"SW5\">[[Star Wars (2013) 5|''Star Wars'' (2013) 5]]</ref> Against her parents' wishes, Prithi abandoned her studies and decided to pursue becoming a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] against the ruling [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\nUpon joining the Alliance, Prithi's file compiled for her was short, compared to the other pilots, but her skills were at a level to get her noticed by [[Alliance High Command/Legends|Alliance High Command]]. Rebel leaders attributed the lack of information on her to the fact that she had spent the majority of her life training on Chalacta, but other leaders, such as [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] believed the lack of information was indicative of a lack of research on the part of those that had accepted her into the Alliance, and that her file was most likely incomplete.<ref name=\"SW3\" />\n\n===Rebel pilot===\n{{Quote|One last thing&hellip;Prithi, my Chalactan pilot.''\"<br />\"''You vetted her, I assume?''\"<br />\"''I did.

Alongside several other Rebel pilots, Prithi was addressed by Organa who stated that the gathered group was now part of a [[Stealth Squadron|commando team]] under her direct command, with the Rebel pilot, [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], as her second. The group had been assigned to root out an Imperial [[Spy/Legends|spy]] who was interfering with the Alliance's attempt to find a new base. As a result, the team was going completely off the grid, reassigned and taken off the books. Although Prithi was hesitant to leave her post and her friend behind, Organa claimed that the assignment would be only temporary. After the team had been introduced to one another, each member of the group was given a stealth [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing starfighter]], designed for the mission.<ref name=\"SW2\" />\n\nAs part of Gray Flight, Prithi was assigned the call sign, [[Gray Seven]], and the team began training exercises. In one exercise, to practice extravehicular retrieval, Prithi was stranded in [[Realspace/Legends|space]] to be retrieved by another pilot. [[Gray Five/Legends|Gray Five]], the Rebel pilot [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], zeroed in on Prithi's location and picked her up. Prithi flirted with Skywalker during the operation, but she was reprimanded by Organa who wanted the exercise to be professional. However, as they put in coordinates to return to the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Rebel fleet]], Skywalker decided to make several different stops before returning, to throw off anyone who might be tracking them. On the flight, Prithi and Skywalker became better acquainted, as the cockpit did not give them much personal space. Upon returning, both Skywalker and Prithi were reprimanded by Organa for taking their time to meet back at the rendezvous. Prithi was confined to quarters, and Skywalker and Prithi were grounded until further notice. Organa personally told Prithi that she would not be flying in the next few missions and assigned her to assist the [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], in rewiring the team's [[holosimulator]]s.<ref name=\"SW3\" />\n\n===Tracking the mole===\n{{Quote|Chalactans believe that all the natural laws of the universe also exist within us, and the goal of the adepts is to strive to understand them and be illuminated. The Force is one of these natural laws.''\"<br />\"''You were in training to become an adept, right?''\"<br />\"''I was, but I was deemed unfit. I couldn't concentrate. I always felt pulled in other directions, like I was meant for bigger things.|Pritha and Luke Skywalker|Star Wars (2013) 5}}\n[[File:PrithiInjured.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Prithi is revived by Mon Mothma after returning to the Rebel fleet.]]\nSkywalker and Prithi continued to fraternize during their grounding, and Prithi learned of Skywalker's Force-sensitivity. During one of their meals together, Prithi noticed Skywalker talking to [[Force ghost|the spirit]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Ben Kenobi]], a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] who had instructed Skywalker in using the Force. Kenobi had warned Skywalker that Leia Organa was in trouble, and the two pilots readied their X-wings to mount a rescue.<ref name=\"SW4\">[[Star Wars (2013) 4|''Star Wars'' (2013) 4]]</ref> Using coordinates given to him by Kenobi, Skywalker and Prithi departed the fleet to where Organa was.<ref name=\"SW5\" /> At the given coordinates, the two Rebels discovered Gray Flight surrounding Organa's heavily damaged X-wing. However, Imperial forces were inbound, and they had only a short window until their enemies would arrive. As Prithi reached out in the Force to sense when the Imperials would arrive, Skywalker worked to set up a trap for the Imperials. As Organa sealed herself in her wrecked starfighter, Skywalker pulled a [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton torpedo]] from the craft, armed it, and used the Force to push it and several [[Ion drive|ion engines]] into the path of the oncoming Imperials.<ref name=\"SW6\">[[Star Wars (2013) 6|''Star Wars'' (2013) 6]]</ref>\n\nPrithi notified the group moments before the Imperials [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace jumped]] into their location, and Gray Flight fired their torpedoes at the engines and the attached torpedo. The resulting explosion disabled the Imperial's [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]] and its [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE Interceptor]] squadron, allowing Gray Flight to escape. Upon their return to the Rebel fleet, Prithi became aware of how much Skywalker cared for Leia Organa. Seeing him agonize over Organa's injuries was all Prithi needed to confirm that he cared more for the Rebel leader than he did for her. She took her bag and departed from Skywalker, ending their relationship.<ref name=\"SW6\" /> Following the rescue mission, Prithi continued to work with the Alliance and alongside Skywalker to uncover the Imperial spy. Their next mission involved smuggling their way onboard the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']] to [[Slicer/Legends|slice]] into Imperial systems and identify the mole in their ranks. To get aboard, Skywalker and Wedge Antilles piloted a [[YZ-775 medium transport]] to Imperial space with Prithi smuggled aboard in her X-wing.\n\nUsing false [[transponder]] codes, Antilles and Skywalker met with the ''Devastator''. Prithi detached from their ship as her fellow Rebels were taken aboard, and she attached her ship to ''Devastator'' with magnets as backup should their mission be compromised.<ref name=\"SW7\">[[Star Wars (2013) 7|''Star Wars'' (2013) 7]]</ref> As the mission proceeded, Prithi meditated in her concealed X-wing to conserve oxygen.<ref name=\"SW8\">[[Star Wars (2013) 8|''Star Wars'' (2013) 8]]</ref> The mission was extended further than they anticipated, and Prithi's [[R5-series astromech droid|R5 astromech droid]] awoke her from her meditation and informed her that her [[Life support/Legends|life support]] system was running dangerously low. Prithi was unable to get ahold of her fellow Rebels on the comm but continued to try to contact them. Although her astromech droid wished to abandon the mission, Prithi demanded that they stay, even if they had to abandon the security protocols of making several hyperspace jumps before returning to the fleet.<ref name=\"SW9\">[[Star Wars (2013) 9|''Star Wars'' (2013) 9]]</ref>\n\nHowever, the time at which oxygen needed to return to the fleet would expire, came and went. Prithi was forced to make her escape from the ''Devastator'' without Skywalker and Antilles. Upon her return, she was struggling to stay alive. Unconscious, Prithi was cut free from her locked down starfighter by Rebel technicians, but signs of life were not readily apparent, her body cold to the touch. Mon Mothma herself administered chest compressions, and Prithi briefly woke to recognize the Rebel leader. Severely hypoxic, Prithi was given a rebreather and rushed to sick bay.\n\n===Leaving the Rebellion===\n{{Quote|It's hard to shake a shaky reputation, and people know about us.

Her beliefs were confirmed when ''Devastator'' arrived, having followed Prithi from her single hyperspace jump.<ref name=\"SW10\">[[Star Wars (2013) 10|''Star Wars'' (2013) 10]]</ref> In ensuing battle, Prithi was recuperating in the med bay, but she reached out in the Force to contact Skywalker, who had escaped from ''Devastator''. Prithi apologized for having to abandon them, and encouraged Skywalker through the attack. The Rebels were able to ward off the attack, when their commander, [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Kell Bircher]], was revealed to be a double agent for the Alliance, ordering his entire squadron to surrender to the Rebellion.<ref name=\"SW11\">[[Star Wars (2013) 11|''Star Wars'' (2013) 11]]</ref>\n\nAlthough Prithi's failures had worked to the Alliance's advantage and allowed Bircher to return to the Rebel fleet, she still felt guilty. She resolved to leave the Rebellion and return to her homeworld of Chalacta. Skywalker tried to convince Prithi to stay, claiming that no one blamed her for what had occurred during the mission, but she did not believe him. She claimed that her failings had compromised her reputation and it would be a difficult task to rebuild it. However, she had another reason for leaving. The Force had called out to her again, sending her on a different path. She wanted to explore her Force-sensitivity on one of her planet's spiritual refuges, despite the love she still had for flying. Once she had made her decision, Skywalker hugged her goodbye, and she told him that she believed he would do great things in the future.<ref name=\"SW12\">[[Star Wars (2013) 12|''Star Wars'' (2013) 12]]</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|It's obvious you have feelings for her, Luke.

Her piloting abilities were impressive enough that she was noticed by Alliance command and selected by Leia Organa for a special mission to root out an Imperial spy within the Rebel ranks.<ref name=\"SW2\" /> During the training exercises for the mission, Prithi became attracted to Luke Skywalker and pursued a relationship with him. However, this attraction would cause her to neglect her sense of professionalism, causing her to be grounded by her commander temporarily.<ref name=\"SW2\" /> After being brought back into active duty, Prithi's affection for Skywalker caused her to risk the location of the Rebel fleet, as she refused to abandon him aboard the ''Devastator''. This nearly caused her death, as her life support systems failed during the long wait for her comrades to return from their mission. This oversight forced her to return to the fleet without making the appropriate hyperspace jumps to ward off pursuing vessels, leading the Imperials back to the Rebellion.<ref name=\"SW9\" /><ref name=\"SW10\" /> Her failures during this mission caused her to abandon the Rebellion, believing that her reputation had been damaged by the risks she had taken and how she had endangered the Rebel fleet. Although she still loved being a pilot, she felt that she was destined for a different purpose.<ref name=\"SW12\" />\n\nPrithi had a minor talent in the Force, which was honed during her time training to become a Chalactan Adept. However, she was unable to concentrate on her studies, believing that she was meant for a different purpose. It was this feeling that caused her abandon her training and join the Rebellion.<ref name=\"SW5\" /> Prithi used her Force abilities to speak with Skywalker over distances, increasing the bond between them when she discovered his own Force-sensitivity.<ref name=\"SW5\" /><ref name=\"SW11\" /> She was also able to use her abilities to sense danger, and was able to warn her superiors about impending attacks from Imperial soldiers.<ref name=\"SW6\" /> Following the conclusion of her mission to the ''Devastator'', the Force called her to return to her studies, and she abandoned the Rebellion to return to Chalacta and develop her Force-sensitivity.<ref name=\"SW12\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPrithi first appeared in the [[Star Wars (2013) 2|second issue]] of the comic book series simply titled [[Star Wars (Dark Horse 2013)|''Star Wars'']] published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].
