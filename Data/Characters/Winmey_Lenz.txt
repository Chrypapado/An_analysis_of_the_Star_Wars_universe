Lenz had close ties to [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and was one of a few off-worlders, including fellow [[Chandrilan]] [[Mon Mothma]], who attended the [[Leia Organa's Day of Demand|Day of Demand]] held for [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] on [[Alderaan]] in [[3 BBY]]. After the ceremony, the young princess saw Lenz in conversation with Bail and Mothma. He was tall, lean and dark-skinned, with a trimmed beard.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\nLenz sponsored the young Chandrilan [[Harp Allor]] in the [[Apprentice Legislature]]. He appeared to be loyal to the rebellion, and was included in the rebel [[senator]]s' strategy meetings. However, Leia and [[Amilyn Holdo]], during a session of their pathfinding class on [[Pamarthe]], witnessed Lenz doing secret dealings with [[Orson Callan Krennic|an]] [[Imperial officer]], selling the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]] cheap [[quadanium steel]] in an attempt to play both sides of the conflict. When Mothma and Bail were informed of the girls' discovery, the two senators planned to phase Lenz out of rebel dealings by making him think there had been a disagreement between several factions, as he could no longer be trusted.<ref name=\"Princess of Alderaan\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan]]'' {{1st|''Leia, Princess of Alderaan'' audiobook}}\n*[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan (audiobook)|''Leia, Princess of Alderaan'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Leia Organa: Ordeal of the Princess]]'' {{1stp}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Winmey Lenz\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lenz, Winmey}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Senators]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
