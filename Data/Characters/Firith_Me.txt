In [[3956 BBY]], he was a witness in the [[Sunry]] case. During the case, he met the former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and revealed to him that [[Elassa Huros]] was in fact a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] that Sunry [[Death/Legends|killed]]. He was also a [[Pazaak Weekly]] reader.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlthough Firith Me is a pazaak player, the player can't play pazaak with him.\n\nFirith Me was voiced by [[Rino Romano]] in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', who does the grunts and small talk of Revan.{{Fact}}\n\nThe player can bribe or threaten Firith Me to testify, the latter of which will earn them dark side points.\n\nIn the PC version, Firith's character model is changed from the model used for him when first seen, to a model similar to [[Gerlon Two-Fingers]] when he makes his appearance at the trial.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Firith Me\n|es=Firith Me\n|fi=Firith Me\n|pl=Firith Me\n|ru=\u0424\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u041c\u0438\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Me, Firith}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]"}}}]}}}}
