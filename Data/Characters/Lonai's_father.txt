He and his [[Parent/Legends|son]] was among the survivors that were brought before [[Predor]] [[Tul'kar]] and [[Tau (individual)|Xesh]] during the culling of [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitives]]. When Xesh sensed the [[Force power/Legends|Force]] within his son Lonai and caused his death, Lonai's father was devastated because of the scene and angrily declared to Predor Tul'kar that the Kumumgah would someday drive the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] away from Tatooine by fighting back. Amused, Predor Tul'kar stated that it was unlikely to occur before shocking Lonai's father to [[Death/Legends|death]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 1]] {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Ojciec Lonaia\n|fr=P\u00e8re de Lonai\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kumumgah]]\n[[Category:Unidentified fathers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
