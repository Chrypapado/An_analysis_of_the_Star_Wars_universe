After not seeing his [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] father, [[Rakir Banai]], in many years, Kitster gave up hopes of being rescued from Tatooine and instead hoped to one day be a [[Majordomo/Legends|majordomo]] for a wealthy [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espan]] estate.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\n{{Quote|Years ago I had a friend -- a slave, like I was -- who later left Tatooine and became a great Jedi Knight.|Kitster Banai, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nKitster Chanchani Banai was born the son of smuggler [[Rakir Banai]],<ref name=\"DB\">{{DB|character|kitster|Banai, Kitster|archivedate=20110607121652}}</ref> circa [[41 BBY/Legends|41 BBY]].<ref name=\"age\" /> Rakir was wanted by the [[Hutt Cartel|Hutts]], who eventually tracked him down and captured his ship with his family on board.

The [[Dug/Legends|Dug]] intended to sell the captives, including Princess [[Arawynne]], to [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder/Legends|Gardulla the Elder]]. The children, disguised as [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]], sneaked into Gardulla's estate and freed the [[Ghostling]] children.<ref name=\"TGC\">''[[Episode I Adventures 5: The Ghostling Children]]''</ref>\n\nKitster was the best friend of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] on Tatooine,<ref name=\"TCSWE-Kitster\" /> but he was also a slave\u2014property of Gardulla, who was ever threatening to sell him to the [[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]] [[Miner/Legends|miners]] if he didn't \"shape up.\"<ref name=\"TGC\" /> During the [[Podracing/Legends|podrace]] on Boonta Eve, Kitster was part of Anakin's pit crew.<ref name=\"TCSWE-Kitster\" />\n\nBefore Anakin left to become a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], he left Kitster some of his prize credits. With it, Kitster bought ''[[Par Ontham's Guide to Etiquette]]'', a book that Kitster memorized to secure a job at the [[Three Moons (hotel)|Three Moons]], run by [[Rarta Dal]]. With that job, Kitster earned enough to buy his own freedom by the time he had grown up.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\">''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''</ref>\n\n===Bandrik wrath===\n{{Quote|I've been trying to help Tatooine's slaves get better treatment. This offends a slaver named Drik Bandrik.|Kitster Banai, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nIt was said that when Kitster grew up years later during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], he became a smuggler and disappeared on one of his runs.{{Fact}} However, he was seen at Mos Espa again,<ref name=\"SWG:KB\">{{SWGcite|exp=AED|type=class|Minor|Kitster Banai|Tatooine}}</ref> around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]].<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> He did not know at the time that his best friend fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and became the dreaded Darth Vader. In fact, he believed Anakin died during the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n[[File:KitsterBanai.png|thumb|The adult Kitster Banai during times of trouble]]\n\nWhen Kitster attempted to improve the lives of a group of slaves, he ended up offending their owner, the slaver [[Drik Bandrik]]. Angered, Bandrik framed Kitster by manipulating a tribe of violent [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] into believing that Kitster had stolen a droid from them. Luckily for Kitster, a benevolent [[Spacer/Legends|traveler]] agreed to help Kitster and kill the group of aggressive Jawas, all of whom were working for [[Wittin/Legends|Wittin]]. As a reward, Kitster gave the traveler Anakin's podracing helmet. However, Kitster's problems were not yet over.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\nBandrik had once again framed Kitster, this time planting evidence with [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] that implicated Kitster with attempting to lead a slave revolt at [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|his palace]] a few years ago. Though a revolt did take place, and fail, Jabba was still enraged enough to send a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Assassin/Legends|henchman]] named [[Deeng]] to kill Kitster. The same traveler who had helped him before agreed to hunt down and kill Deeng.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\nThough the traveler succeeded in killing Deeng, Bandrik's persistence in framing Kitster did not end there. This time Kitster was being implicated in the murder of a [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]]. Kitster insisted that he was nowhere near the murder, and had the evidence to prove it. Kitster's alibi was that he was rotting in an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Prison/Legends|jail]] cell during the time of the murder. He was arrested for \"political agitation,\" as a result of his attempts to promote slave rights. Ultimately, the Galactic Empire released Kitster, because they believed him to be harmless. However, [[Sont Toipo]], a local vigilante leader on Bandrik's payroll, was already rallying a lynch mob to kill Kitster. Kitster surmised that the mob consisted of six or eight local moisture farmers. He pleaded with the traveler to kill Sont Toipo, but to make an effort to spare the others, as they were merely farmers. Kitster hoped they would run off after Toipo was killed. The traveler agreed, and set out to successfully kill Toipo, while making an effort to spare the lives of the farmers. For the traveler's efforts, Kitster gave away another souvenir, a [[Droid brain/Legends|droid brain]] built by his old friend Anakin.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\n[[File:Kitster-adult.jpg|thumb|left|Grown-up Kitster]]\nEventually, Kitster learned that the \"murdered\" moisture farmer was in fact not murdered at all, but rather paid by Bandrik to leave town long enough for a lynch mob to be formed. In order to clear his name, Kitster asked the traveler to find the moisture farmer, a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] named [[Krin Vel]], and bring her back to Mos Espa. Despite being ambushed by thugs working for Bandrik, the traveler managed to find Krin, and escort her back. Krin claimed that she did not know she was being used in a plot against Kitster. She wished to be brought back, so that both Kitster and herself could see to it that Bandrik went to prison.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\nWith the help of Krin, Kitster managed to assemble enough evidence that would clear him of Bandrik's fake charges. He considered sending the evidence to the [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police]], but soon changed his mind when he surmised that the police and the Empire would have no reason to arrest him. He instead told the traveler to bring the evidence to a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] friend, a [[Kitonak/Legends|Kitonak]] who went by the name [[Thermal Det]]. The traveler agreed to Kitster's final task, and succeeded in finding Thermal and giving him the evidence. Thermal saw to it that the information went straight to Jabba, and made it onto the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]]. Kitster thanked the traveler once again for helping him. Kitster concluded that Jabba would be angered with Bandrik for being manipulated. He believed that Bandrik would have to leave the planet if he ever hoped to survive.<ref name=\"SWG:KB\" />\n\nIronically, Kitster's father, Rakir Banai, was working for Bandrik during these events. Bandrik personally tasked Rakir to deal with the troublemaker, without informing him of his identity. Thanks to the help of a spacer, Rakir finally discovered that Bandrik was a slaver and that his long missing son was the troublemaker. Rakir later send out messengers to the various cities of Tatooine to find Kitster.<ref name=\"SWG:RB\">{{SWGcite|exp=AED|type=class|Minor|Rakir Banai|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\n===Anakin's legacy===\nEventually, Kitster married a local [[Kuati/Legends|Kuati]] woman named [[Ulda]], who maintained the old [[Mos Espa Grand Arena/Legends|Podracing Arena]], eventually turning it into a [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] bike arena. However, Kitster quickly fell in love with the arena's bartender, [[Tamora Spice]]. Kitster left Ulda and married Tamora, and together they had two kids, [[Ji Banai|Ji]] and [[Elly Banai|Elly]].<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\" />\n\nWith Tamora by his side, Kitster soon accomplished his ultimate goal in life by becoming the [[Majordomo/Legends|majordomo]] at the [[Rendala Estate]] in Mos Espa. However, by [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]] the estate had been foreclosed, leaving Kitster unemployed. Times became so hard that Kitster took to auctioning off personal objects, such as a [[Holocube/Legends|holocube]] of his old friend Anakin Skywalker after winning the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]]. The holocube was sold to a [[Gotal/Legends|Gotal]] collector for thirteen hundred [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] at the same auction as the famous painting ''[[Killik Twilight]]'', which held [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] codes in it.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\" />\n\n[[File:Tatooine_ghost_illustration_scene.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Older Kitster meeting with the disguised Solos]]\nIn [[8 ABY/Legends|8.5 ABY]], he met [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] at the same auction. When ''Killik Twilight'' was threatened with destruction, Kitster acted fast, stealing the painting and using his old friend [[W. Wald|Wald's]] [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] bike to escape into the deserts from pursuing [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. When a huge sandstorm struck, Kitster took shelter in a [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Sandcrawler/Legends|Sandcrawler]] that eventually was attacked by [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]]. The Sand People kidnapped Kitster and the painting and brought them back to the [[Valley of the Spirits]], where they planned on sacrificing him to the \"[[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|angry ghost]]\" that had [[Mission to Tatooine (Separatist Crisis)|slain]] an entire tribe with a \"[[Lightsaber/Legends|glowing, humming sword]].\" The Tuskens began to [[Torture/Legends|torture]] Kitster as part of the sacrifice by breaking his fingers for every time the moss painting needed to be watered. Fortunately, within a few days, Han and Leia found and rescued him and the painting. Before parting, Kitster explained his beliefs that Anakin must have always regretted his vengeful attack on the Tuskens, even after becoming the feared [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], which eventually brought Leia to conclude that she should forgive her father.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKitster Banai was portrayed by [[Dhruv Chanchani]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']].<ref name=\"TPM\" /> \"Chanchani\" was later given as his middle name in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.<ref name=\"TCSWE-Kitster\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Anakin's Fate]]''\n*''[[Episode I Adventures 5: The Ghostling Children]]''\n*''[[Episode I Adventures 6: The Hunt for Anakin Skywalker]]''\n*''[[Episode I Adventures 7: Capture Arawynne]]''\n*''[[Episode I Adventures 8: Trouble on Tatooine]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' novelization]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (unabridged audiobook)|''Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' comic]]\n*[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (junior novelization)|''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' junior novel]]\n*''[[Episode I: Anakin Skywalker]]''\n*''[[Episode I: The Phantom Menace \u00bd]]''\n*''[[Episode I: Queen Amidala]]''\n*''[[Episode I: Qui-Gon Jinn]]''\n*''[[Dear Anakin]]''\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The Dangerous Games]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*{{Tales|6|Thank the Maker}} {{Flash}}\n*''[[The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary]]''\n*{{CollectorCite|6|Around the Galaxy|Around the Galaxy: Dark Horse Unmasks The Phantom Menace}}\n*{{CollectorCite|6|Use the Force|Use the Force: Episode I Card Quiz}}\n*{{YJCCG|set=Boonta Eve Podrace (YJCCG)|link=boontaevepodrace/light/large/5kitsteranakinsfriend.html|cardname=Kitster}}\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided Quick Reference Guide]]''\n*{{FFCite|9|POD3&ndash;4, ''Boonta Eve Classic Podrace''}}\n*{{FFCite|123|KIT1-2, ''Kitster Banai''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|66|Bookshelf}}\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary]]''\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{1stID}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Agents_of_Deception#Card_gallery|cardname=Kitster Banai}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Head-to-Head Tag Teams]]''\n*{{DB|character|kitster|Banai, Kitster|archivedate=20110607121652}}\n*{{InsiderCite|131|Things To Look Out For In Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace 3D!}}\n*{{SWE|characters|kitster|Kitster}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Kitster Banai}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kitster Chanchani Banai\n|es=Kitster Chanchani Banai\n|fr=Kitster Chanchani Banai\n|nl=Kitster Chanchani Banai\n|pl=Kitster Chanchani Banai\n|ru=\u041a\u0438\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0439\n|pt=Kitster Chanchani Banai\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Banai, Kitster}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Majordomos]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Waiters]]"}}}]}}}}
