Knowing they would die if they returned north, the [[Aiwha/Legends|aiwha]] pod [[Destruction of Protas|fought]] Protas. The pod struggled to overcome their enemy until Protas exposed his throat, which the aiwha saw and clamped down upon. Protas attempted to dislodge the aiwha, beating at and killing the aiwha. Even in death, the aiwha's jaws did not release, allowing his pod to deal a final blow to the god-beast.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Kamino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The planet Kamino, home of the mythical aiwha and his pod]]\nAccording to the [[Kaminoan/Legends|Kaminoan]] mythological tale&mdash;\"[[The Tale of the Aiwha Pod]]\"&mdash;a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[aiwha]] lived with his [[Unidentified aiwha pod|pod]] in the [[Ocean/Legends|oceans]] of the<ref name=\"tale\" /> [[Planet/Legends|planet]]<ref name=\"AOTC\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]]. One [[Winter/Legends|winter]], the [[Pod (social group)|pod]] were travelling south out of the [[Temperature/Legends|cold]] northern waters when they encountered the [[Deity/Legends|god-beast]] [[Protas]], ruler of Kamino's oceans as the most powerful beast.<ref name=\"tale\" /> \n\nPreviously, Protas was told to have [[Battle of Thalina|defeated]] the titan [[Melkorr]] and [[Battle of the Ancient Trench|overcome]] an army of [[Kikla]] swimmers, both of whom had challenged the [[Magic|mystical]] Protas for his authority and rule. With the victories over his challengers, Protas became arrogant in his old age. It was with this mindset that he prevented the aiwha pod from continuing their journey south, directing them to turn back north on a whim.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\nKnowing they would [[Death/Legends|die]] if they returned to the northern waters, the aiwha had allegedly [[Destruction of Protas|attacked]] Protas as a unified force without warning or any desire for either fame or glory. Despite swarming the monster-god and making powerful attacks, they could not break the defenses of Protas' thick skin with enough efficacy to deal a killing blow. In the midst of this battle, Protas exposed his soft throat, creating an opening the aiwha took advantage of. The aiwha saw the vulnerability and took advantage, clamping down on Protas' throat with his teeth. Realising his error, Protas fought against the aiwha, dealing blow after blow to the brave aiwha. The blows took their toll, killing the aiwha but without complete success&mdash;even in death the aiwha did not release Protas, allowing the pod to deal a final blow and ending the battle.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\nThe apparent sacrifice made by the aiwha, which allowed his pod to achieve victory, was remembered and immortalised in the tale that would eventually be translated from [[Kaminoan (language)/Legends|Kaminoan]] into [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] by an individual named [[Ryan Kaufman]]. The conduct of the pod in defeating Protas without seeking glory or power; the resulting peace in Protas' absence; and the self-sacrifice of the aiwha, explained why the aiwha were accorded the respect of all the creatures of Kamino.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThe aiwha, like the rest of his pod, did not seek glory or fame and took to battle out of his necessity to survive. He was brave and cared deeply for his pod, sacrificing himself to ensure their survival.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nThe aiwha was observant, noticing the weakness shown by Protas in the midst of battle. He had strong jaws, able to hold on despite the beating sustained by Protas.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThis aiwha appeared in \"[[The Tale of the Aiwha Pod (short story)|The Tale of the Aiwha Pod]]\", a [[List of short stories|short story]] by [[Ryan Kaufman (author)|Ryan Kaufman]], which was published in the [[2005]] book, ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando: Prima Official Game Guide]]''.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Tale of the Aiwha Pod (short story)|sformatted=The Tale of the Aiwha Pod|book=Star Wars: Republic Commando: Prima Official Game Guide}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Kamino residents]]\n[[Category:Kaminoan mythology]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified creatures]]"}}}]}}}}
