Forgive me, my queen.|Commodex Tahn, upon confessing to Aphra|Darth Vader (2015) 10}}\n'''Commodex Tahn''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] from [[Naboo]].<ref name=\"V10\" /> During the last [[Standard decade|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic]], he worked as a military clerk. At some point before the last [[Standard year|year]] of the [[Clone Wars]], [[Commodex Tahn's father|his]] [[Parent|father]] [[Death|died]], prompting Tahn to leave Republic service and enter the family trade as a [[mortician]].<ref name=\"V9\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 9|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 9]]</ref> It was he who, at the conclusion of the Clone Wars, prepared the body of [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], [[senator]] and former [[Monarch of Naboo|queen]] of Naboo, for [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala's funeral|burial]]. Shortly before her death, Amidala was pregnant with [[twin]]s, whose father was none other than [[Anakin Skywalker]], a [[Jedi Knight]] who had turned to [[Dark side of the Force|evil]]. Amidala had managed to give birth to her children, who were spirited away so Skywalker would never find them. Tahn, as a mortician, was tasked with doctoring the corpse to make it appear that Amidala was still pregnant.<ref name=\"V10\" /> Thereafter, he decided to retire.<ref name=\"V9\" />\n\nNearly twenty years later, Skywalker, who went by the [[Sith]] moniker of [[Darth]] Vader, learned that he had [[Luke Skywalker|a son]]. Commodex Tahn received a [[Assault on Commodex Tahn's villa|visit]] from [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]], an agent of Vader, who [[torture]]d him into confessing. Tahn, however, only told Aphra what she already knew, that Amidala had given birth to a boy. The mortician, however, resisted mentioning the existence of a second child, [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|a girl]]. Despite his confession, Tahn was killed by [[0-0-0|Triple Zero]], a sadistic [[droid]] who worked with Aphra.<ref name=\"V10\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Doctor Aphra: An Audiobook Original]]''\n*[[Darth Vader (2015) 9|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 9]] {{1stm}}\n*[[Darth Vader (2015) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 10]] {{1st}}\n*[[Darth Vader (2015) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 11]] {{C|Mentioned only; in the opening crawl}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Darth Vader (Star Wars Encyclopedia)|Darth Vader}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Commodex Than\n|es=Commodex Tahn\n|ja=\u30b3\u30e2\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\n|pl=Commodex Tahn\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0422\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tahn, Commodex}}\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
