The Selonians' actions were discovered by the Empire, however, and the latter's invasion force leader, [[Darth Decimus]], sent an Imperial task force to dispatch Murthil and thus quell the unrest.<ref name=\"Selonian Uprising\" />\n\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nHunkered down in Murthil's bunker behind a [[Force field/Legends|force field]], the [[Elite Selonian Guard]]s readied to face Imperial forces. When an Imperial hero barged into the Selonian's room, Murthil called for the individual to lay down arms and surrender, although it was in vain. The two sides clashed, and the Imperial ultimately wiped out the Selonian Guard before defeating their den [[Parent/Legends|mother]], putting an end to the uprising.<ref name=\"Selonian Uprising\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|War is in our blood.

Destha--take the weapon.|Murthil, faced with a player lying of surrender|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nDestha appears in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''. If the player chooses to lie about the Imperial forces' agreement to Murthil's call for surrender, the Imperial is instructed to remain still as Destha is commanded by the den mother to take the Imperial player's weapon. However, the player then either stabs or fire at the approaching Destha, killing the Guard and thus breaking a promise. Murthil is angered by the lying, and rallies her guards to down the Imperial. Whichever choice is taken by the player during this mission, the Selonian uprising is quelled by the Imperial strike team and all of Murthil's guards, including Destha, are killed.<ref name=\"Selonian Uprising\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Selonians]]"}}}]}}}}
