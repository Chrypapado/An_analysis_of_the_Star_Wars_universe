He had become the senior [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] by [[24 ABY/Legends|24 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\nTriebakk became a member of the [[New Republic Advisory Council]], advising [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Borsk Fey'lya]]. Triebakk was one of the minority which openly supported the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi Knights]], despite a strong disgruntlement with them after the [[Battle of Osarian|Rhommamool incident]]. In the meetings he sat between Fey'lya and [[Cal Omas]], his closest ally. Triebakk complained directly to senator [[Pwoe]] of [[Dac]] and [[Niuk Niuv]] of [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]] when they were rude to the Jedi.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]], Triebakk was one of the Advisory Councilors lost in the planet, and Pwoe quickly declared him dead. However, the Wookiee somehow succeeded in leaving the planet before its [[Terraforming/Legends|Vongforming]] and he joined Omas and other surviving politicians on [[Dac|Mon Calamari]]. Once on Mon Calamari, Triebakk was a firm supporter of Cal Omas, especially when he tried to become the Chief of State. Triebakk tried to convince senator [[Cola Quis]], a candidate without a real chance to win, to give his votes to Omas in exchange of some political favors.\n\nTriebakk was chosen to be a member of the [[High Council (Galactic Alliance)|High Council]], the new Jedi Council formed by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and Omas. This new Council consisted of six Jedi and six New Republic representatives, of which Triebakk was the strongest supporter of the Jedi, and a determined opponent of [[Alpha Red (pathogen)|Alpha Red]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=starwars/article.asp?x=sw20020228adiplomacy|text=Diplomacy and Daggers|int=Diplomacy and Daggers|archivedate=20021226041056}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{Blog|holocron|32/comments|Jedi High Council Roster (NJO and beyond)|Keeper of the Holocron's Blog|Leland Chee|nobackup=1}}\n\n{{Council28}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of [[Mytaranor sector/Legends|Mytaranor sector]]\n|years=c.
