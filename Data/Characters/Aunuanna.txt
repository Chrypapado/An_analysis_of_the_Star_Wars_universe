She was the [[Parent/Legends|mother]] of [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]].\n\n==Biography==\nA poor, if not senile, old woman, she was reduced to selling her home-brewed [[Gizer ale]] on the street. After selling her wares on [[Kyood Vurd]]'s turf one too many times, he decided to have the old woman killed. Luckily for her, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] and [[Depa Billaba/Legends|Depa Billaba]] arrived in time to save her. She had seen the Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]] before they had arrived claiming, \"So many Jedi! Three in one day!\" Grateful, she gave the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] her most prized possession, her child's [[Aurra Sing's father/Legends|father's]] [[Swoop/Legends|swoop bike]].\n\nAunuanna was extremely grateful to the Jedi for saving her life and because the Jedi had taken her baby away from her, and in turn, away from the slums of Nar Shaddaa. She referred to her child only as \"My Angel,\" but it was later revealed that her child was none other than the infamous Jedi hunter [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 17|''Star Wars'' (1998) 17]] {{1st}}\n*''[[Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|64|SIN1, ''Aurra Sing''}}\n*{{FFCite|78|WIN11, ''Mace Windu''}}\n*''[[Threats of the Galaxy]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia]]'' {{Imo}}\n*{{DB|character|aunuanna|Aunuanna|archivedate=20100505030411}}\n*{{DB|character|aurrasing|Sing, Aurra|archivedate=20100328031954}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Aunuanna\n|fi=Aunuanna\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
