He's led hunting parties into the Shadowlands and even fought slavers, like you probably are...|Woorwill to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Rorworr''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who lived in [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro Village]] on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] in [[3956 BBY|c. 3956 BBY]], during the time of the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nRorworr had a family that was taken by slavers, leaving him wealthy with all of the belongings of his family.\n\nRorworr was a hunter who was greatly admired by the younger Wookiees who shared his village. It was said by [[Woorwill]] that he lead hunting parties into the [[Shadowlands/Legends|Shadowlands]] helped fellow warriors and even fought slavers. However, in truth he betrayed his people by attacking lone Wookiees as they roamed among the Shadowlands, selling his captives to the [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]] of [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]] and was presumably in the employ of the Wookiee chieftain, at the time, [[Chuundar]], until his death at the hands of [[Jaarak]], who had learned of his treachery.\n\nNot wishing to bring disillusionment and sorrow onto the youth of his home village, Jaarak attempted to keep Rorworr's duplicity secret.\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIt remained so until it was exposed by the amnesic [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who had begun investigating the death, having come across the Wookiee's corpse while searching the forest floor for the [[Star Map]] that was located on that [[Planet/Legends|world]]. Though most of the younger generation, particularly [[Woorwill]], were upset by the death of their hero, many of them grew to realize that by dealing with slavers, Rorworr had shed his honor, becoming unworthy of their adoration in the first place.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the game, it was stated by Worrroznor that Woorwill had a bond with Rorworr, who has no living blood relations, however this bond is not properly explained.\n\nAccording to the [[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|Official Strategy Guide]] it was said that Rorworr was planning to sell Woorwill to Czerka and attempted to convince Jaarak to join him in his slavery activities but Jaarak refused and killed him because of this.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}} {{Corpse}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Rorworr\n|ru=\u0420\u043e\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0440 (\u041a\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0438\u043a)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Czerka employees]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
