[[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]], followed by Vader himself boarded the ship and took it over, aiming to locate plans for the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[battlestation]] which they believed to be on board in transit to the Rebel Alliance. The Imperials were unsuccessful in finding the plans but did capture [[Prince/Legends|princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], an [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomat]] believed to be aiding the Alliance. The ''Devastator'' then sent Stormtroopers down on to Tatooine to search for the plans there, as they believed they may have been placed in one of the ''Tantive IV's'' [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]] and jettisoned to the planet. Whilst still orbiting Tatooine, the ''Devastator'' was attacked by a squadron of Rebel fighters called [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Blue Squadron]], who were based in the Tatooinian city of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. The Rebels managed to intercept a group of [[TIE/LN starfighter]]s the ship sent against them whilst destroying the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer's]] emplacement [[Cannon/Legends|cannons]] and [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|deflector shield generators]], and damaging its bridge.<ref name=\"EAW\">''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]''</ref> Following the events at Tatooine, the Rebel Alliance managed to [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destroy]] the Death Star over [[Yavin Prime/Legends|Yavin Prime]], using the plans from the ''Tantive IV''.<ref name=\"ANH\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> As a consequence, the ''Devastator'' was taken from Vader by the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], and a young [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]] named [[Kell Bircher]] was made its captain.<ref name=\"ITSOY\">[[Star Wars (2013) 1|''Star Wars'' (2013) 1]]</ref>\n\n===Return to the ''Devastator''===\nLater that year, however, Bircher was revealed to be a Rebel spy that had managed to insert his name into the civilian and military databases of the Empire.<ref name=\"SW 12 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 12|''Star Wars'' (2013) 12]]</ref> The captaincy was transferred back to Wermis, who accompanied Vader on a mission to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ultaar/Legends|Ultaar]] in search of a [[Rebel information retrieval outpost]] they believed to be there. Whilst Vader and Wermis were en-route in the ''Devastator'' to the Ultaar, Vader felt a presence in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and ordered Wermis to check what was located at the coordinates the presence had been at. Wermis tasked a team of [[Technician/Legends|technicians]] with checking the coordinates while Vader traveled to Ultaar's surface with a group of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]]. On the surface Vader discovered the outpost had already been [[Assault on Ultaar|destroyed]] by [[Beilert Valance/Legends|Beilert Valance]], a [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] who was searching for [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and the group with him. Before returning from Ultaar, Vader received a message from Wermis telling him that nothing was located at the coordinates he'd been asked to check, and that the captain considered the search a waste of time. Vader belittled Wermis, and informed him of the importance of tracking down other [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force users]], then told him to find the closest location a starship could have traveled to from the coordinates he'd checked. Wermis then informed Vader, as the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] returned to the ''Devastator,'' that the nearest location was [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]] and set a course for that location.<ref name=\"SOADL\" /> Vader forced Wermis to push the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|star Destroyer]] to its limit in order to reach the Wheel as fast as possible in case his target escaped. When Wermis argued and claimed that the journey was based on a whim, Vader [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force choke|Force choked]] the captain to show him the power of the Force and that it was no whim. He then demanded Wermis crawled to him and mocked the man's stamina.<ref name=\"TTLG\">[[Star Wars (1977) 22|''Star Wars'' (1977) 22]]</ref> When the ship arrived at the Wheel Wermis informed Vader, and told him they had received transmissions claiming the space station was in turmoil due to the fact that the forces of Imperial commander [[Zertik Strom/Legends|Zertik Strom]], whom normally was stationed just outside the Wheel's sphere of diplomatic immunity, had trapped Rebels there. Instead of informing the Wheel of their presence and landing, Vader ordered Wermis to have the station scanned as to locate the Rebels so that the ''Devastator'' could catch them if they escaped. As Vader suspected, Strom failed to capture the Rebels and was killed by [[Simon Greyshade/Legends|Simon Greyshade]], administrator of the Wheel. Meanwhile Vader's targets, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and his companions, attempted to escape the station in Greyshade's [[Luxury yacht/Legends|yacht]] ''[[Spoilt Sport]]'' and discovered the ''Devastator'' waiting for them. Wermis promised Vader that the Rebels couldn't escape but was thrown to the grown as the ''Devastator's'' bridge was shaken by fire from the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], a [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]] belonging to [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], another of Luke's companions. Recognizing the ''Falcon'' as the vessel which had fired on him at the Battle of Yavin, Vader ordered Wermis to focus entirely on destroying Solo's starship. Before the ''Devastator'' could vaporize the ''Falcon ''however, Luke lashed out in the Force due to his recent anguish and caught Vader unprepared, stunning him and allowing both of the Sith Lord's targets to escape.<ref name=\"FITF\">[[Star Wars (1977) 23|''Star Wars'' (1977) 23]]</ref>\n\nWermis later witnessed Vader torturing a [[Unidentified Rebel prisoner (Devastator)|Rebel prisoner]] trying to learn the name of a Rebel deserter whom might tell the name of the Hero of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin]], the pilot who had destroyed the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]. The sight made Wermis feel queasy and he asked to leave, something that Vader mocked him for. Vader however learned the name [[Tyler Lucian]], a Rebel who fled the [[Great Temple/Legends|Great Temple]] Rebel base before the Battle of Yavin. Vader then had Wermis take him to [[Centares/Legends|Centares]], the planet which Tyler had fled to, and proceeded alone to track the deserter down. Vader returned without having learned the Hero's name, as the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Beilert Valance/Legends|Beilert Valance]] had also tracked down Lucian and [[Duel on Centares|fought]] Vader when the pair encountered one another. Vader killed Valance but not before the hunter gave a speech which persuaded Lucian to kill himself rather then give Vader what he wanted. Upon returning to the ship Vader gave Wermis further coordinates to travel to and put the ship on full alert status.<ref name=\"SW29\" /> Vader continued his hunt for the mystery pilot and eventually learned the man's name from another [[Unidentified Rebel (refueling Station)|Rebel]] he interrogated after destroying a [[Rebel refueling station]]. With his target's name finally known, Vader ordered Wermis to take the ''Devastator'' to rendezvous with the fleet of [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Ulric Tagge/Legends|Ulric Tagge]], much to Wermis's surprise, due to the problems Vader had previously had with the [[House of Tagge/Legends|house of Tagge]], meaning the rivalry between Vader and Ulric's brother, [[Orman Tagge/Legends|Orman Tagge]]. When Wermis voiced these concerns Vader told him to simply follow orders, which Wermis did. Upon reaching Tagge's fleet Ulric came aboard the ''Devastator'', where Vader questioned him about a recent defeat he and his family had suffered at the hands of Luke Skywalker, in which Ulric believed his brothers Orman and [[Silas Tagge/Legends|Silas Tagge]] had both been killed. Vader revealed that they had not in fact died, but had nearly suffocated before being rescued and were in the process of recovering, although still not conscious. He then told Ulric that they could remain unconscious, allowing Ulric to remain Baron of his house instead of Orman reclaiming the title, as long as he promised Vader his absolute loyalty. Ulric agreed to the deal and after the baron left Wermis admitted his surprise at Vader's alliance with Tagge, as the captain had expected the Sith Lord to destroy the Tagge line once and for all at the meeting.<ref name=\"DLG\" />\n\nWith the Tagges now serving as his pawns Vader had Wermis take him to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Monastery/Legends|Monastery]], where Ulric's sister [[Domina Tagge/Legends|Domina Tagge]] served as a member of the religious [[Order of the Sacred Circle]]. Vader and Domina then hatched a plan together to lure Luke Skywalker to the planet, where they would capture him. Domina traveled to the Rebel's base at Yavin, where she told the Alliance that the Empire had sent an envoy to persuade the order to side with them in the Galactic Civil War. She persuaded the Rebels that Luke should accompany her back to Monastery to act as their own envoy, which he did with Han Solo, his co-[[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], and [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], another Rebel. Once they reached the planet Vader confronted Luke and informed him that he was the opposing envoy, after which the Sith informed Wermis over [[Comm unit/Legends|comm unit]] to commence the next part of the plan. Wermis then located the ''Millennium Falcon'' which was orbiting Monastery and still crewed by Solo, Chewbacca and Organa, and ordered them to prepare for Imperial inspection. After using the ''Devastator's'' [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]] to pull the ''Falcon'' aboard Wermis confronted Solo, who showed him forged papers and claimed that the Imperials had no issues with him. Wermis however destroyed the papers and informed Solo that he knew who the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] was due to Vader's careful planning. Wermis then ordered his stormtroopers to search the ship for the princess who he believed was hidden on board in a [[Spice/Legends|spice]] hold. When the search revealed nothing Solo offered to leave without the captain filing a report as to avoid showing his superiors he'd captured the wrong ship, but Wermis refused the offer, having Solo and Chewbacca thrown in detention cells instead. After leaving the ''Falcon'', Wermis was informed that Orman Tagge, who was still being kept on the ship, had made a full recovery. Having been given no orders by Vader as to what to do in such a situation, the captain ordered for Orman to simply be kept in his [[life support capsule]]. Immediately after giving the order however, he was thrown to the floor by explosions from lower decks of the ''Devastator'', which he was informed had come from two supply holds. Once recovered, he rushed to the Star Destroyer's medical bay to find that the explosions had shattered the Tagge's life support capsules and that Orman was gone. One of Wermis's troops then suggested that House Tagge agents may be the ones causing the explosions, an idea Wermis pretended he too had had, hoping Lord Vader would accept it and not blame him upon his return. Before he could begin the search for Tagge, the ''Devastator's'' artificial gravity was turned off leaving Wermis floating in the medical bay. Princess Organa was in fact the one behind the various sabotages on the ship, and using a [[Jetpack/Legends|propulsion pack]] navigated the ship while the Imperials were caught unprepared. During the chaos that the gravity change caused, Organa freed Solo and Chewbacca and the trio escaped from Wermis's clutches in the ''Falcon'', with Orman also stowed away on board.<ref name=\"RQR\">[[Star Wars (1977) 36|''Star Wars'' (1977) 36]]</ref>\nVader's plans on Monastery also ended in failure, with the Rebels escaping and only Orman being killed after he forced Han and Leia to take him to Vader and Luke. With the Rebels escaped, Vader returned to the ''Devastator'' and had Wermis leave the [[Monastery system|system]] soon after.<ref name=\"IMC\">[[Star Wars (1977) 37|''Star Wars'' (1977) 37]]</ref>\n\n===Administrating the Wheel===\nAt some point after the events at Monastery, Wermis was transferred from naval duty to a desk job as [[Administrator/Legends|Administrator]] of the Wheel,<ref name=\"Vegas\" /> which had been run by a council with the aid of the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Master-Com]] since Greyshade's [[Death/Legends|death]],<ref name=\"BTR\">''[[Beyond the Rim]]''</ref> but was then seized by the Empire. Upon beginning his admin-ship, Wermis shut down the Wheel for two [[Standard month/Legends|months]] to perform repairs to the section of the station damaged by the [[Proton grenade/Legends|Proton grenade]] which Greyshade had used to kill Strom. After reopening it, many were reluctant to return due to the Imperial presence, although the draw of [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] did bring in enough customers to keep the station going. All profits from the Wheel during this period were transferred to the Empire, bar those that Wermis secretly kept for himself and the mistress he kept while Administrator, a [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] named [[Malyssa Raventhorn]]. Over the several years in which Wermis was administrator a series of mysterious cyber-attacks caused him serious issues, but despite this he grew obese and sedentary in his posting. Wermis's time as administrator ended when the [[Besh Gorgon system/Legends|Besh Gorgon system]], the [[Star system/Legends|star system]] in which the Wheel was located, was [[Liberation of the Besh Gorgon system|liberated]] by the newly formed [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. The event caused Wermis to suffer a [[Death/Legends|fatal]] [[Heart/Legends|heart]] attack as his meager forces on the Wheel were overwhelmed. Immediately after Wermis's death, Raventhorn and the profits Wermis had kept for himself vanished from the Wheel and weren't located by the Republic forces. Admin-ship of the Wheel was eventually handed over to Master-com, who had remained on the Wheel during Wermis's control and had in fact been behind all of the cyber-attacks.<ref name=\"Vegas\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Contradict}}\nCaptain Wermis and Captain [[Bolvan/Legends|Bolvan]] served at the same time aboard the ''Devastator''. Wermis has been specified as the vessel's commanding officer; Bolvan apparently served in an inferior capacity, overseeing turbolaser operations and ground assaults. Their exact professional relationship in the command hierarchy is uncertain, but they may have belonged to different branches of the Navy, as Bolvan was a black-uniform officer, whereas Wermis wore a standard naval officer's uniform.\n\n[[File:Wermis_Infinities.jpg|thumb|150px|An [[Infinities]] portrayal of Wermis.]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Death Star (novel)|''Death Star'']] {{C|As \"the captain\"}}<!--Chapter 52, page 1-->\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 21|''Star Wars'' (1977) 21]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 22|''Star Wars'' (1977) 22]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 23|''Star Wars'' (1977) 23]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 29|''Star Wars'' (1977) 29]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 35|''Star Wars'' (1977) 35]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 36|''Star Wars'' (1977) 36]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 37|''Star Wars'' (1977) 37]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Visions of the Blade]]'' {{Nc}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GalaxyCite|11|ComicScan|ComicScan: Paint Him Black}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-v/bts/article/f20070124/index.html|text=Time Capsule: Darth Vader 1980|archivedate=20070129051307}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/explore/visualguides/chp03.html|text=Visual Guide -- Chapter 3: Imperial Boarding Party|archivedate=20080511153707}} {{1stID|Mulchive}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/viva-space-vegas-the-history-of-the-marvelous-wheel-part-2|text=Viva Space Vegas!
