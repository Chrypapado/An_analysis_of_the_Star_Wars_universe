I was a gunner on the ''Anakin Solo'', Jacen Solo's Impstar Deuce. We called her the Black Annie.|Tirs Maladane, in an excerpt from a transcript of ''Wookiee World Horror Witness!''|The Essential Guide to Warfare}}\n'''Tirs Maladane''' was a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] from [[Little Mochot]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], serving as a [[Gunner/Legends|gunner]] on the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']], under the command of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], the Galactic Alliance's [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]]. The lieutenant fought in engagements such as [[Battle of Hapes (Second Galactic Civil War)|Hapes]] and [[Battle of Kuat (Second Galactic Civil War)|Kuat]] during the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], a conflict between the [[Confederation]] and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.\n\nMaladane later fought in the [[Battle of Kashyyyk (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Kashyyyk]], where Maladane fired a starboard [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolaser]] quad into the forests of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] at the orders of Solo. Maladane later remembered the experience at that battle for ''[[Wookiee World Horror Witness!]]'', a feature from [[TriNebulon News/Legends|TriNebulon News]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|But I never expected the order I got. Fire into the forests? I had to ask my CO to repeat that. But that's what Solo wanted. And so every battery on the Black Annie that had a firing arc opened up.|Maladane, in an excerpt from a transcript of ''Wookiee World Horror Witness!''|The Essential Guide to Warfare}}\nTirs Maladane was from [[Little Mochot]] on the [[Water/Legends|rainless]] [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. When Maladane was fifteen, the Tatooine native's [[Tirs Maladane's aunt|aunt]] sent the teenager to the world [[Pii III]] during the [[Summer/Legends|summer]] to earn some [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]] in the [[Greel wood]] logging industry. During the first [[Standard day/Legends|day]] there, it rained heavily, and Maladane stood out in it laughing and cheering, even though the other workers thought the youth strange. Maladane returned to Little Mochot, where the teenager dreamed of rain every night.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nLater in life, Maladane served as a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] on the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]]' [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']], [[Commander/Legends|commanded]] by the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], the Galactic Alliance's [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]]. Maladane and some of the crew called the ''Anakin Solo'' the \"Black Annie.\" The Tatooine native was a [[Gunner/Legends|gunner]] operating the starboard lateral quad [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolaser]] cannon and fought in engagements such as [[Battle of Kuat (Second Galactic Civil War)|Kuat]] and [[Battle of Hapes (Second Galactic Civil War)|Hapes]] as the [[Second Galactic Civil War]] raged between the Galactic Alliance and the [[Confederation]].<ref name=\"TEGTW\" /> After the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] abandoned the Galactic Alliance at [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]] in [[40 ABY]] for Solo's [[Battle of Ossus (Second Galactic Civil War)|move against]] the [[Jedi Academy (Ossus)|Jedi Academy]] on the world [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]], Jacen Solo, who had now secretly taken the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] title [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Caedus, led the ''Anakin Solo'' to the forested world of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] to confront the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the native [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]], who were harboring Jedi on their homeworld.<ref name=\"inferno\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref>\n\nMaladane and all of the other gunners were ordered to fire into the forests of Kashyyyk after the Jedi and the Wookiees refused to yield to Solo. Maladane asked the commanding [[Officer/Legends|officer]] to repeat the order, but fired anyway because if Maladane refused, the gunner would be put in the brig, with someone else firing at the forests. Maladane cried as they continued to open fire on the forests, setting ablaze the ancient [[Wroshyr tree/Legends|Wroshyr trees]]. As [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] began to attack the ''Anakin Solo'', Maladane gladly turned the [[Cannon/Legends|cannon]] to fire on the fighters, since they could actually fight back. In [[41 ABY]], the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] the war ended, a feature from [[TriNebulon News/Legends|TriNebulon News]] called ''[[Wookiee World Horror Witness!]]'' contained Maladane remembering the experience during the battle.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You shouldn't be able to kill something that's fifty thousand years old by just squeezing a trigger. But that's what I was doing. And the whole time, the tears were running down my face.|Maladane, in an excerpt from a transcript of ''Wookiee World Horror Witness!''|The Essential Guide to Warfare}}\nBecause Maladane was from rain-deprived Tatooine, he stood out in the downpour on Pii III, laughing and cheering while out in it, and even dreamt about it every night after returning to Tatooine. Maladane was scared of the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]], the task force that Jacen Solo was the head of, and upon arrival at Kashyyyk, Maladane knew the mission was going to be bad because Solo meant business. The gunner also knew about the Wroshyr [[Tree/Legends|trees]] of Kashyyyk, and thought them amazing. When commanded to fire on the forests, Maladane complied to the unexpected order as the gunner reasoned if one objected, one would simply be in the brig with someone else firing at the trees. Nonetheless, when first hearing the order, he was surprised enough to request that Solo repeat the order.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\nIf Maladane had another choice, the gunner would have taken it so as to not fire on the forests. The Tatooine native believed that one person should not be able to destroy something as ancient as the Wroshyr trees with the simple touch of a button, and Maladane cried the entire [[Time/Legends|time]] the gunner fired upon the forests. As enemy starfighters attacked the ''Anakin Solo'', Maladane turned the cannon to fire on them because they could actually fire back. Maladane was also willing to share the experiences during that battle with [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] via ''Wookiee World Horror Witness!''.<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTirs Maladane was first mentioned in the [[2012]]'s ''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'', written by [[Jason Fry]] and [[Paul R. Urquhart]] as a guide dedicated to the conflicts in the [[Star Wars]] [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].<ref name=\"TEGTW\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maladane, Tirs}}\n[[Category:Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet personnel]]\n[[Category:Gunners]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
