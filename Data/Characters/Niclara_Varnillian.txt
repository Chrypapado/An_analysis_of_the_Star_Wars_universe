She was part of the operations crew that tested the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Superlaser/Legends|superlaser]] on the planet Alderaan. The destruction of her homeworld did not affect her in the least. Prior to the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], she was transferred to the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Imperial Star Destroyer]] [[Pulsar (Star Destroyer)|''Pulsar'']] to serve as chief gunnery officer under Commander [[Dor Reder]].\n\nWhile on leave on [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]], Varnillian identified a pair of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] operatives, but she botched the [[Skirmish on Ord Mantell (3 ABY)|mission]] to capture them, resulting in several Imperial soldier fatalities. She was demoted, but remained aboard the ''Pulsar'' until the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].\n\nAfter the ''Pulsar'' surrendered, Varnillian and a group of Imperial troops were able to steal a Rebel transport and escape. She was last known to have led a group of Imperial military vessels in attacks on New Republic installations throughout the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|8|Wanted by Cracken (Star Wars Adventure Journal)|Wanted by Cracken}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Interlang\n|uk=\u041d\u0456\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0456\u043b\u043b\u0456\u0430\u043d/\u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0438\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Varnillian, Niclara}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Chief gunnery officers]]\n[[Category:Death Star residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy enlisted personnel of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
