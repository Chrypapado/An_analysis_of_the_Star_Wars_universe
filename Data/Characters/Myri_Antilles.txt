In [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]], after the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]], she and her older sister [[Syal Antilles|Syal]] were sent to [[The Maw]] for safety along with mainly [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] children for the rest of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]].\n\n===Later life===\nIn [[40 ABY]], Myri was living with her family on [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]], [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. She inherited Iella's inquisitive nature and affinity for intelligence activities, and, as of the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], was being groomed by her mother to follow in her footsteps as an intelligence agent.\n\nAfter her graduation she was approached by both the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] and [[Five Worlds]], she subsequently refused both offers deciding to do as her father had, and just stay out of the whole war, something that didn't happen as they were forced to blast their way off of Corellia when they noticed [[Han Solo/Legends|Han]] and [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Solo]] and [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] being chased after by the [[Corellian Defense Force/Legends|Corellian Defense Force]]. They escaped to the ''[[Errant Venture]]'' where Myri worked for tips as a card dealer in one of the ''Venture's'' casinos with her mother to gather information. The sheer amount of money that she was making caused her to rethink about joining the intelligence business albeit halfheartedly. She also correctly deduced that whoever was behind the conflict was secretly trying to split the Solo-Skywalker \"alliance.\"\n\nMyri continued to gather intelligence during the course of the [[Second Galactic Civil War|war]] while on board the ''Errant Venture'' getting rich gambling in the process.\n\nIn [[44 ABY]], Myri was recruited to the reformed [[Wraith Squadron]] to expose and capture General [[Stavin Thaal]] as a member of the [[Lecersen Conspiracy]]. She contributed by disguising herself as a protocol droid, enabling her to get close to Thaal so she could swipe his blaster before he could kill his ex-wife [[Zehrinne Thaal|Zehrinne]] and Colonel [[Kadana Sorrel]] when he, in his new identity as Thadley Biolan, was exposed as an \"impostor\".\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Myri_Antilles.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Myri playing with her food as a child.]]\nHer role as a member of [[Wraith Squadron]] in [[Aaron Allston]]'s [[2012]] novel ''[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill]]'' was reported by attendees of [[Wikipedia:Dragon Con|Dragon Con]] [[2011]] stating that the author had confirmed it.<ref name=\"Dragon Con\">{{JCFcite|postnum=31889052|board=Literature|thread=X-Wing: Mercy Kill - New Aaron Allston Wraith Squadron Novel (2012)|user=xoubara|PTtime=9/6/11 5:51am|accessdate=February 27, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802125528/https://boards.theforce.net/threads/x-wing-mercy-kill-new-aaron-allston-wraith-squadron-novel-2012.31173300/page-13}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Mercy Kill'' she is described as having natural black hair, despite being first shown with blonde hair in ''Union''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Union]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|135|Roll of the Dice}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill]]''\n*[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill (audiobook)|''X-Wing: Mercy Kill'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|wedgeantilles|Antilles, Wedge|archivedate=20100203101942}}\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Wraith Three]]<ref name=\"XWMC\">''[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill]]''</ref>\n|years=[[44 ABY]]<ref name=\"XWMC\" />\n|before=Eventualy [[Myn Donos]]<ref name=\"X-Wing: Solo Command\">''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''</ref>\n|before-years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]]<ref name=\"X-Wing: Solo Command\" />\n|after=\n|after-years=}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Myri Antilles\n|de=Myri Antilles\n|pl=Myri Antilles\n|ru=\u041c\u0438\u0440\u0438 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Antilles, Myri}}\n[[Category:Antilles family]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Coalition personnel]]\n[[Category:Wraith Squadron personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
