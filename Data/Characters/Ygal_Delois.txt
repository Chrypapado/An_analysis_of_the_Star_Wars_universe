A protege of Peacebringer, Delois eventually grew envious of his father figure and formed a partnership with [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[General/Legends|General]] [[Bentilais san Sk'ar]], who plotted to conquer Shiva IV and install Delois as its new ruler in the Empire's name. Delois revealed his treachery when Sk'ar openly attacked Shiva IV in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], but was ultimately defeated in single combat by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] agent [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and the Imperial plan was foiled.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Delois! Traitor! You were one of my most trusted aides&mdash;|Aron Peacebringer|Star Wars (1977) 54}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native of the remote [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Shiva IV]], Ygal Delois was a warrior of the Human nation-state known as the [[Calian Confederacy]] during the era of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Delois was a close companion and protege of the Calian Confederacy's [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]], [[Aron Peacebringer]], who saw Delois as like a son to him.<ref name=\"marvel54\">[[Star Wars (1977) 54|''Star Wars'' (1977) 54]]</ref> Delois was at Peacebringer's side when he signed the [[Concordat of Peace]] with [[Demarch]] [[K\u00e9ral Longknife]] of the [[Twelve Tribes of T'Syri\u00e9l]], ending generations of war on the planet. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], a foreign invasion force from the far-off [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] arrived at Shiva IV,<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> led by the [[Kaleesh/Legends|Kaleesh]] [[General/Legends|General]] [[Bentilais san Sk'ar]].<ref name=\"aliens\">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/97/indexp4.html|text=Aliens in the Empire, Part 2: To a Traitor Go the Spoils|int=Aliens in the Empire}}</ref> Sk'ar made contact with Delois and revealed to him his plans for the world: the Empire would use an [[anti-matter bomb]] to destroy the Calian [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Illyriaq\u00fcm]], stepping into the chaos and anarchy that would ensue to establish dominion over the world. Delois was offered the chance to serve the Empire as the planet's new leader.<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> Covetous of Peacebringer's status,<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> Delois accepted the deal, planning on taking his wife [[Alisande]] and ruling over Shiva IV in the Empire's name.<ref name=\"marvel54\" />\n\n[[File:DeloisAndLuke.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ygal Delois battles Luke Skywalker on Shiva IV.]]\nNot long thereafter, the Imperials used one such bomb to destroy the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[K'avor]], in a demonstration of the power with which they hoped to conquer the world. Not knowing of his friend's treachery, Peacebringer chose Delois as part of his scouting party to investigate what happened to the city. Along the way, they discovered a young offworlder named [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], an important [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] leader who had crash-landed on Shiva IV. Delois and his fellows leapt into action and rescued Organa from a group of outcast bandits, returning her to safety in Illyriaq\u00fcm. Delois later danced with Organa several weeks later at the one-year anniversary celebration of the Concordat of Peace, but the proceedings were suddenly interrupted by Sk'ar's long-awaited attack on Peacebringer's palace.<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> Peacebringer and Organa were taken [[Prison/Legends|prisoner]], and Delois had a hand in [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] Organa during interrogations. However, Peacebringer and Organa ultimately escaped custody in time to help foil the planned destruction of Illyriaq\u00fcm, with Rebel reinforcements&mdash;Organa's friends [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]&mdash;showing up in the nick of time along with Longknife. Delois engaged Skywalker in single combat but was defeated, and Sk'ar was killed soon afterward.<ref name=\"marvel54\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Enjoy your crown while you can, Warlord Aron&mdash;for you shan't be wearing it much longer!

His ambition outweighed any allegiance to his people, and he was willing to sacrifice the heart of the Calian Confederacy, killing many of his fellow Calians, in order to take power.<ref name=\"marvel54\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYgal Delois first appeared in [[Star Wars (1977) 53|''Star Wars'' (1977) 53]], written by [[Chris Claremont]] and released in [[1981]].<ref name=\"marvel53\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 53|''Star Wars'' (1977) 53]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 54|''Star Wars'' (1977) 54]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/97/indexp4.html|text=Aliens in the Empire, Part 2: To a Traitor Go the Spoils|int=Aliens in the Empire}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ygal Delois\n|pl=Ygal Delois\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delois, Ygal}}\n[[Category:Agents of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Calians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Shiva IV residents]]"}}}]}}}}
