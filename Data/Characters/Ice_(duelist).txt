So back off!|Ice, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Ice''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] competitor at the [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] [[Taris dueling ring|dueling ring]] that operated at the [[Upper City Cantina]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. Inspired by the legendary [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] duelist [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]], Ice was a competent [[Gladiator/Legends|gladiator]] who received her handle as a result of her cold disposition. To her, coldness was a theme that she adopted for every aspect of her persona: she was harsh and critical toward everyone, even her fans. Nevertheless, she was popular among audiences of the arena, being an intermediate-ranking duelist. Shortly before the [[destruction of Taris]], she was challenged and defeated by the [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] former [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who had joined the duel ring under the alias \"[[Mysterious Stranger]]\" and would subsequently surpass the other duelists and become the ring's last champion before its destruction.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Ice? Eh, she's not much for personality, but she's a hell of a fighter&mdash;confident, steady. Popular with the crowd, too. If you go up against her you know you're in for a tough match.|Marl describing Ice|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n===Childhood===\nIn her childhood, the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] later known as Ice idolized the famed [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]], a legendary [[Gladiator/Legends|gladiator]] of the [[Taris dueling ring|dueling ring]] run by [[Ajuur]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], located in the [[Upper City Cantina]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. In Starkiller, she found her inspiration, hoping to follow in his footsteps and pursue a career as a duelist. Upon meeting the gladiator for the first time, however, she found his personality revolting. So affected was the girl by this meeting that she resolved to emulate Starkiller's ruthless, anti-social character, embracing it as a lesson in the reality of the world.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n===Career as a duelist===\nAs an adult, the woman stayed true to her dream and joined the Taris dueling ring,<ref name=\"kotor\" /> having been personally chosen by Ajuur himself.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|I|75|Ice}}'</ref> By [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Ice had acquired a considerable following among fans of the sport, having earned a reputation as a devious fighter.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> She was especially popular with the female demographic, as women admired that her prowess proved they could achieve in such a field, but she was dismissive of being an icon for gender equality. Of the competitors current to that [[Standard year/Legends|year]], Ice could defeat [[Gerlon Two-Fingers]] and [[Deadeye Duncan]], the latter of whom was considered the worst duelist of all time. While respected for her skills, she was no match for the veteran duelist [[Marl]] or the then-champion [[Twitch (Rodian)|Twitch]] and her ranking was therefore intermediate.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIt was in that same year that a [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] led by [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Malak]] occupied Taris and imposed martial law alongside a planetary [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]]. Under the quarantine, the dueling arena continued to operate as usual, with the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] enforcing the ban on [[Death/Legends|death]] matches that had led to Bendak's retirement.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nHowever, one of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Republic soldier|soldiers]] who escaped the [[Attack on the Endar Spire|destruction]] of the Republic [[Warship/Legends|warship]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'', the [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] former Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], visited the Upper City [[Cantina/Legends|Cantina]] and decided to join the dueling arena under the alias \"[[Mysterious Stranger]]\". After beating Deadeye Duncan and Gerlon Two-Fingers, he fought Ice and emerged victorious, winning 300 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. With her defeat, Ice was quick to conclude that Revan's martial prowess far eclipsed her own, accepting this as another simple, cold, hard truth. Sure enough, she would watch as Revan went on to defeat Marl and Twitch as well, becoming the last champion of the duel ring before the [[destruction of Taris]] at the hands of the Sith.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I've never been one to shy away from the cold, hard truth so I'll just come right out and say it: I can't compete with the likes of you, Stranger. I know when I'm overmatched. You're good&mdash;very good. But you're wrong if you think that means I'm suddenly going to warm up to you. Truth is, I really don't have anything more to say, so you might as well move on.|Ice to Revan after losing to him|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nAs her stage name suggested, Ice exhibited a cold, dispassionate personality, generally unwilling to befriend others. Though she was deeply cynical, she was not always so, as in her childhood, she dreamed often of meeting her idol [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]]. When this dream at last came true, she was struck by his toxic personality. Whether she felt more heartbroken or impressed, the meeting profoundly shaped her worldview, and she became convinced that to thrive, she must be every bit as ruthless and cruel as he was. To that end, she internalized the theme of coldness for her persona, even greeting strangers with condescension unprovoked. In spite of this, and her propensity for blunt, rude responses&mdash;even to her fans&mdash;she was not above congratulating fellow competitors, especially if they proved their remarkable skill. While her resolution to be emotionless made her asocial, it also meant that she was not one to take scorn or defeats personally. Moreover, she would be motivated by shocking incidents to reflect upon what lessons it held.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIce was a [[Color/Legends|blonde]]-[[Hair/Legends|haired]] woman with pale skin and blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. By her own account, many men that she was disgusted by;found her attractive and her immediate assumption upon meeting Revan was that he was just another male fan who had come to flirt with her.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nIce's dispassionate attitude was reflected not only in her asociality, but in her combat style as well. Characterized by [[Marl]] as a steady fighter, she was confident in her martial expertise and this confidence allowed her to exercise a good measure of control in battle. While not unrivaled in the duel ring, never having been able to surpass Marl or unseat [[Twitch (Rodian)|Twitch]], she was still lauded as a strong competitor by fans of the sport.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nDuring her duel with Revan, she opened the fight with her [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], and in such scenarios, she only switched to her [[Sword/Legends|sword]] if her opponent closed the gap between them.<ref name=\"kotor\" /> In other cases, she was known to reverse this tactic, hiding a blaster in her [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]] to be employed only if a fight turned against her.<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nIn her career, she favored a [[combat suit]], standard for its time, and carried a [[Heavy blaster pistol/Legends|heavy blaster pistol]] alongside a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Congratulations, Stranger. I never thought anyone would beat Starkiller. Did you know it was because of him that I became a duelist in the first place? As a little girl I used to dream of meeting him one day. When I finally did, the guy was a complete slime ball. Made me realize I had to be cold and ruthless to survive, like him. And now he's dead. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere. Something for me to think about, at least. Congratulations again, Stranger\u2026 and goodbye.|Ice to Revan, should the player kill Bendak Starkiller|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIce's first appearance is as a non-player character in the 2003 [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. In the Xbox version of the game, her hair is brown, whereas in the PC version, it is blonde. In the game, the player, Revan, can choose to fight her in the dueling ring. However, the nature of the encounter is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment. Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with her.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nShould the player defeat Ice and proceed to kill Bendak Starkiller in a death match, earning [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points in the process, Ice becomes introspective as to what his death meant for her cynical worldview.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nIce receives a brief entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', where she is described as having competed in the duel ring on Taris during the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> This is implausible and most likely an error as the Great Sith War occurred in [[3996 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> forty years before the events of ''Knights of the Old Republic'' where Ice still appears as a young woman.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ice\n|es=Ice\n|pl=Ice\n|ru=\u0410\u0439\u0441\n}}\n\n[[Category:Duelists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Gladiators]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
