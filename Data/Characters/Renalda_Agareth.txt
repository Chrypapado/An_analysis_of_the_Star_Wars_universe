When her brother [[Braedon Agareth|Braedon]] was forcibly pressed into service by the [[Justicars' Brigade]], she asked a Republic-allied individual to help save him.\n\n==Biography==\nRenalda and her brother Braedon lived in the [[Justicar territory|Justicars' Sector]], a region on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] controlled by the militant vigilante group known as the [[Justicars' Brigade]]. They lived during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]], surviving the widespread violence and destruction in the years that followed the [[Sacking of Coruscant]] by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]].<ref name=\"Justice\" />\n\nBy the year [[3643 BBY]], both of the Agareth's parents had died and Braedon, at the age of 15, was raising his sister on his own. But one night, Braedon was caught by the Justicars out after curfew and because he looked older, he was pressed into indentured service as a Justicar. Renalda asked a Republic-allied individual to rescue Braedon, but Braedon told the hero that the Justicars would simply capture him again if his name remained in their file of curfew violations. While the individual destroyed the files, Braedon went into hiding and told them that he would contact Renalda when it was safe. They returned to Renalda and told her that Braedon would find her when it was safe.<ref name=\"Justice\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRenalda Agareth was created for ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] released by [[BioWare]] on [[December 20]], [[2011]].
