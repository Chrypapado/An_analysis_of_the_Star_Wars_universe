His project included the construction of a \"[[super-vaporator]]\", which can only be assumed to be a more powerful model of Tatooine's common [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|moisture vaporators]] used to pull water from the dry desert air.\n\nEgoreg's assignment was plagued by mysterious mechanical failures, contaminated oil supplies and malfunctioning [[Droid/Legends|droids]]. While attending a meeting on his plans with several key players of the project, the conference room they were in suffered a minor explosion. No one was hurt, but just to be safe Egoreg ordered the project to stop. [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] went down to Maintenance for repairs, where he and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] discovered that the project's oil supply had been tampered with. The two went immediately to tell Egoreg, but were surprised en route by a group of [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]]. Rushing to their aid, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] ran into the Jawas as well, who were caught red-handed by C-3PO and R2-D2 sabotaging the machines and spoiling the oil supply, which had been the cause of the malfunctioning droid problem.\n\nThe Jawas were punished, and Chewbacca was awarded a medal for capturing them.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEgoreg's name is a slight respelling of George backwards &ndash; a nod to the creator of ''[[Star Wars]]''. It is unknown if Captain Egoreg is somehow related to [[Egroeg Sacul]], a character mentioned in the ride [[Star Tours (real-world)|''Star Tours'']].\n\nThe two men pictured above are never positively identified. One is Captain Egoreg, while the other is an unnamed scientist at the conference.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Mystery of the Rebellious Robot]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]"}}}]}}}}
