He's a powerful man.|[[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mack Jasper|Jasper]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Daclif Gallamby''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served as [[Diktat]] of the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]] between the [[Death/Legends|death]] of his predecessor, [[Dupas Thomree]], in [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], and the loss of Corellia to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] in [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]]. Even after this date, however, he seemed to have maintained something of a shadow government in the [[Outlier systems]] of the sector.\n\n==Biography==\n===Diktat of Corellia===\n{{Quote|I think Thomree figured he had protected himself from assassination by makin' a nobody his successor. Wouldn't be the first time someone tried that\u2014or the first time it failed.|[[Thrackan Sal-Solo]]|Assault at Selonia}}\nGallamby, with [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]] as his deputy, presided over a period of increasing insecurity and paranoia in Corellian space. The elements of the Imperial Navy [[Sector Group/Legends|Sector Group]] tasked to defend the [[Five Worlds]] were often forced into the Outlier systems to deal with [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] activity, so pirates turned their attention to the capital system instead, in such strength that the [[Corellian Security Force]], even with the support of the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]], did not have the resources to deal with them effectively. The Diktat's response was to encourage a restrictive isolationism, feeding&mdash;and perhaps also driven by&mdash;the streak of suspicion and distrust of outsiders in the Corellian character.\n\n===The Rogue Corsec plot===\n{{Quote|I do not have words to express the delight and deep thanks I have for your actions this day! I feared that the light had fallen from my administration, plunging the entire government into a darkness from which there would be no escape. But then out of that growing darkness, our hero arose. You!|Daclif Gallamby, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Daclif Gallamby was the victim of a plot arranged by a group of former members of the [[Corellian Security Force]] known as the [[Rogue CorSec]].<ref name=\"SWG:GttSotRS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Go to the Source of the Remote Signal|Corellia}}</ref> Their objective was to create a public political-judicial scandal in order to overthrow the Diktat and his government.<ref name=\"SWG:RtToaGD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Receive the Thanks of a Grateful Diktat|Corellia}}</ref> The Rogue CorSec first recruited the [[Ragtags]] to [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggle]] illegal [[Spice/Legends|spice]] in the [[Coronet Capitol]] building.<ref name=\"SWG:RtMSC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Reacquire the Missing Starship Component Shipment|Corellia}}</ref> Then, the Rogue CorSec managed to plant a remote relay device directly on the diktat's personal data terminal. With this device, they were able to send files from a remote location and make them appear as originating from the terminal to which the device was attached. The Rogue CorSec thus planted orders, apparently from the Diktat himself, instructing the Ragtags to smuggle spice into the Capitol.<ref name=\"SWG:SOtGS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Seek Out the Gadget Specialist|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nThe plan was foiled because the Ragtags made a mistake and also smuggled in the Capitol a shipment stolen from the businessman [[Ral Mundi]].<ref name=\"SWG:RtMSC\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> a spacer was recruited by CorSec [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mack Jasper]] to investigate the missing shipment of starship components ordered by the [[Ral Mundi's Starship Emporium]].<ref name=\"SWG:FtMSOSC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Find the Missing Shipment of Starship Components|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer discovered that the shipment was stolen by the Ragtags and transported into the Capitol.

The spacer downloaded proof of the Diktat's innocence in computers and finally killed the Rogue CorSec commanders who were responsible for the plot: [[Hiram Bish]] and [[Mtara Vinram]].<ref name=\"SWG:GttSotRS\" /> When the spacer returned to the Coronet Capitol, the grateful Diktat Daclif Gallamby awarded the Corellian [[Medal for Distinguished Service]] to the spacer for the service rendered to himself and to the government.<ref name=\"SWG:RtToaGD\" />\n\n===Post-Endor===\nAfter the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Gallamby's regime remained loyal to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]&mdash;though they were given little option to dissent, as the Imperial Navy presence was massively reinforced. Within six months of Endor, the fleet deployment in the Corellian system had been increased to twenty-five [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Imperial Star Destroyers]] under Admiral [[Jaeffis]]. This was one of the largest fleet deployments anywhere in the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], and it was due to be further strengthened when Admiral [[Roek]] arrived to assume overall command with the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Aggressor (Executor-class)|''Aggressor'']] and five other Star Destroyers. The Imperials' primary aim was to secure the orbital shipyards, but on the planet, officers of the New Order's security apparatus, like [[Kirtan Loor]] of [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]], played an increasingly repressive role, attempting to suborn [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] into becoming a paramilitary arm of the Empire.\n\nIn [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]],<ref name=\"TEGtW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'', p. 166</ref> Corellia briefly became the focus of the military power-struggle within the Empire, when ''Aggressor'' defected to [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Josef Grunger]], who was building up his forces in preparation for an attempt to seize the Imperial throne. Another Grand Admiral, [[Danetta Pitta]], allied himself with Gallamby and took command of the loyalist forces in the sector, with a [[Unidentified Torpedo Sphere (Corellia)|Torpedo Sphere]] as his command ship. The subsequent [[Battle of Tralus (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Tralus]] decimated both fleets, however, and may have marked the end of any effective Imperial Navy presence in the sector.<ref name=\"Who's Who\">{{InsiderCite|66|Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Gallamby remained in power, and subsequently continued his policy of inward-looking suspicion much as before. One effect of this was the reorganization of CorSec into the [[PSS]], some time between [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]] and [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]]. Yet the Diktat's restrictive measures seem to have always been compromised at the practical level. The PSS were more concerned with appearances and petty disorder than with serious reform of the local underworld, and the attitude towards the \"Rebels\" was always ambivalent: while the Diktat's officials were aware that [[Rostek Horn]] was in contact with his grandson [[Corran Horn|Corran]], a traitor in the eyes of the Empire even before he joined [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]], they simply censored their communications, and allowed them to continue.\n\nNevertheless, Gallamby refused to allow Corellia to join the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], and as the position of the Empire became untenable, he and other leaders of his regime retreated to the outlier systems. In [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]], Corellia became a member of the New Republic, which installed [[Governor-General/Legends|Governor-General]] [[Micamberlecto]] in the Diktat's stead.\n\nDiktat Gallamby's eventual fate is unknown, and he is recorded to have disappeared and presumably killed later on after he took half of the planet's treasure. His political faction, however, continued to exert influence through ex-Imperial politicians elected on Corellia, and became the basis of the subsequent [[Human League]] insurgency. Although leadership had passed to Thrackan Sal-Solo by [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]], the group Gallamby had led through the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] would continue to play a role as one of the main blocs in Corellian politics, at least until the time of Sal-Solo's assassination in [[40 ABY]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDaclif Gallamby was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:HGtII\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nDaclif Gallamby and Brantlee Spondoon were present in the original release of the game. Like most quest giver NPCs in the earliest versions of the game, they proposed \"minor quests\" to the players. These quests did not provide any experience and just consisted in moving to a random location in order to kill or protect one or several NPCs.<ref name=\"SWG\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref> These minor quests were removed from the game with the release of the expansion ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan]]'', on [[November 1]], [[2005]], since both characters were included in a new story arc, i.e., the Rogue CorSec plot against the Diktat.<ref name=\"SWG:ToOW\">{{SWG|Trials of Obi-Wan}}</ref> This questline was later slightly revamped with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 27 Notes for February 15th, 2006|Publish 27]]\", on [[February 15]], [[2006]],<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 27|archivedate=20060217101736}}</ref> as the story arc was inserted into the \"[[W:c:swg:Legacy Quest|Legacy Quest]]\", the main questline in the game.<ref name=\"SWG:StDO\" /><ref name=\"SWG:GttSotRS\" /><ref name=\"SWG:RtToaGD\" /><ref name=\"SWG:SOtGS\" /><ref name=\"SWG:WftG\" /><ref name=\"SWG:HGtII\" /><ref name=\"SWG:FowtRCAD\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWG|Trials of Obi-Wan}}\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}}\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 26|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 26]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Assault at Selonia]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cynabar's Fantastic Technology: Droids]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*{{FFCite|103|German Edition - SAL2, ''Thrackan Sal-Solo''}}\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Squadrons Over Corellia|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Mack_Jasper_(card).JPG|nobackup=1|cardname=Mack Jasper}}\n*''[[Suns of Fortune]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Diktat]] of [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]]\n|years=c.
