When we can see peace on the horizon.|Satele Shan|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Satele Shan''' was a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who served as the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order's]] [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] and the [[Galactic War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]]. The daughter of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Tasiele Shan]], who was herself a descendant of the legendary Jedi Knights [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Bastila Shan]], Satele was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3699 BBY]]. Inheriting [[Shan family|her family's]] [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]], she was inducted into the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Order and became the [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Ngani Zho]], though she later traveled to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Korriban]] to study under the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] [[Jedi Battlemaster|Battlemaster]] [[Kao Cen Darach]]. It was there that she witnessed the [[Battle of Korriban|recapture]] of the planet by the Sith Empire in [[3681 BBY]], and she escaped to warn the Republic with the help of the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Nico Okarr]] and a [[Republic trooper]] named [[Jace Malcom]] at the cost of Darach's life.\n\nAchieving the rank of Jedi Knight under the tutelage of Master [[Dar'Nala]], Shan led her fellow Jedi and the forces of the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]] into battle in the [[Great Galactic War]], becoming a well-known hero to the Republic. Shan also grew close with Malcom despite the Jedi Order's restrictions on attachments, and their bond drove her to rescue Malcom and his small band of [[Republic Special Forces Division|Special Forces]] [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] when the Empire invaded the world in [[3667 BBY]]. Her arrival turned the tide of the [[Battle of Alderaan]] in the Republic's favor. After defeating the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Malgus]] in combat with the help of Malcom, she and Malcom began an affair that lasted for six [[Standard month/Legends|months]] before Shan broke it off in fear of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|darkness]] in the [[Soldier/Legends|soldier's]] heart. However, she was pregnant with Malcom's child, and Shan eventually gave birth to her son, [[Theron Shan|Theron]], in secret with the help of Master Zho before giving the child up to the Jedi Order and returning to the battlefield.\n\nIn [[3653 BBY]], Shan was selected to be part of the delegation that was to attend [[Alderaan peace conference|peace talks]] with the Sith Empire on Alderaan. However, the Empire used the conference as a distraction while it [[Sacking of Coruscant|attacked]] the Republic's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], holding the world hostage to force the Republic to accept the terms of the [[Treaty of Coruscant]]. As [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] settled into an uneasy Cold War, Shan foiled a [[Dar'Nala's conspiracy|conspiracy]] to sabotage the new peace perpetrated by Dar'Nala herself and afterward embarked on an odyssey inspired by the call of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] across the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. The journey led her to the Jedi Order's long-lost homeworld of [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], and for her rediscovery of the planet, Shan was appointed to the position of Grand Master and given leadership of the entire Order. In her new role, Shan guided the Order through a number of crises that arose during the Cold War also and [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] her [[Kiffar/Legends|Kiffar]] Padawan, [[Shigar Konshi]], to Knighthood.\n\nAs the fragile calm of the Cold War began to collapse, Shan worked with the [[Republic Emergency Response Corps]] to protect the unsteady peace and the innocents of the galaxy, and she was alerted to a dangerous threat from the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor]] by his former servant [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Scourge (Sith)|Scourge]] when a [[Mission to the Emperor's Fortress|daring mission]] that she had authorized to capture the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] ended in disaster. Learning that the Emperor intended to [[Sith Emperor's ritual|extinguish all life in the galaxy]], Shan helped the Jedi Knight known as the [[Hero of Tython]] foil the Emperor's plans and personally led an invasion [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] in an assault on the Imperial capital of [[Dromund Kaas]] while the Knight [[Dromund Kaas operation|confronted]] and defeated the Emperor. As the renewed war continued to spread across the galaxy, Shan worked with her former flame, Malcom, in his capacity as [[Supreme Commander]] of the Republic Military, and the two achieved [[Battle of Duro (Galactic War)|victory]] over the prototype Imperial [[Warship/Legends|warship]] ''[[Ascendant Spear]]'' at [[Duro/Legends|Duro]] thanks to the efforts of their son, Theron. Shan also forged a temporary truce with the Empire's [[Darth Marr]] in order to combat the threat of the [[Order of Revan]], and the two led their combined forces in defeating the returned Revan on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. After the [[Eternal Empire]] [[Eternal Empire conquest|conquered]] the Republic and Sith Empire, Shan was disheartened by the casualties the Jedi Order suffered under her command and renounced her title, going into a meditative exile with the [[Force ghost|spirit]] of the Sith Darth Marr.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Satele_young.png|thumb|right|240px|Satele with her Master, Ngani Zho]]\n{{Quote|He was my first Master&mdash;he ''always'' made me proud, even when he was speaking ''nonsense''.|Satele Shan, on her apprenticeship to Ngani Zho|The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 5}}\nSatele Shan was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3699 BBY]] to the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Tasiele Shan]], who was the descendant of the legendary [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Bastila Shan]].

The Republic pressured the Order into [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiling]] Tasiele to an [[Unidentified Outer Rim planet (Tasiele Shan)|uninhabited planet]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. When the political controversy eventually died down, the Order attempted to retrieve the Jedi Knight, but Tasiele was nowhere to be found&mdash;the only thing the Order could locate in Tasiele's abandoned dwelling was a series of journals written to Satele, which it delivered to the missing Jedi's daughter.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Apprenticed to [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Ngani Zho]], Shan [[Jedi training/Legends|studied]] the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]]<ref name=\"Lost Suns 1\" /> until [[3681 BBY]], when she traveled to the [[Korriban's orbital security station|Republic's space station]] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Korriban]] to study under the Order's [[Jedi Battlemaster|Battlemaster]], [[Kao Cen Darach]].<ref name=\"Gnost\">[[The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural (real-life book)|''The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural'']]</ref> Under Darach's tutelage, Shan learned how to wield and fight with the [[Color/Legends|blue]] double-bladed lightsaber that she constructed for herself.

The [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]] soon began attacking the edges of the Republic, instigating the [[Great Galactic War]].<ref name=\"Gnost\" />\n\n[[File:SateleandDarach.png|thumb|left|190px|Shan and her second Master, Kao Cen Darach]]\nNot long into Shan's stay, she and her Master were alerted to the landing of an unidentified [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] on the surface of Korriban by the [[Space station/Legends|space station's]] crew. Shan and Darach traveled to the surface along with [[Corporal/Legends|Corporal]] [[Jace Malcom]] of the [[Republic Special Forces Division]] and were able to capture a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]] named [[Nico Okarr]],<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> though they failed to capture [[Farel Wickes]], the infamous [[Thief/Legends|grave robber]] from whom Okarr was attempting to purchase [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifacts]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Impounding Okarr's [[Starship/Legends|ship]],<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> an [[XS stock light freighter/Legends|XS stock light freighter]] named ''[[Redshifter]]'',<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> the three brought the smuggler back up to the [[Realspace/Legends|space]] station and were in the process of escorting Okarr to his cell along with another trooper when Shan was overcome<ref name=\"Return\" /> with an [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|intense feeling]] of pain and dread in the Force.<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> Outside the station's [[Viewport/Legends|viewport]], an [[Fleet/Legends|armada]] of over thirty [[Harrower-class dreadnought|''Harrower''-class dreadnoughts]] jumped out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]<ref name=\"Return\" /> into the [[Horuset system]].<ref name=\"Atlas\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> Darach immediately recognized that their attackers were Sith and that the outpost would not withstand the [[Battle of Korriban|attack]], so he quickly decided that their priority had to be warning the Republic of the Sith Empire's attack. When Malcom warned Darach that they would be unable to outrun the Sith's [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]], Okarr surprised the Jedi and the soldiers by reminding them of his ship's speed. Darach, Shan, Okarr, Malcom, and the other [[Republic trooper|trooper]] immediately made their way to the [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] where the ''Redshifter'' was docked, fighting off attacks by Imperial boarding parties in the process.<ref name=\"Return\" />\n\nShan and Darach dealt with the Imperials who had entered the hangar while Okarr, Malcom, and the other [[Trooper/Legends|trooper]] defeated their pursuers, though the soldier was [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the fighting. As the remaining four prepared to take the ''Redshifter'', an [[Fury-class Imperial interceptor|Imperial interceptor]] landed in the hangar, and Darach ordered the smuggler to ready his ship. While Malcom and Okarr prepared the ship, Shan and her Master engaged the two Sith arrivals&mdash;a masked [[Sith Inquisitor]] named [[Vindican]] and his Human [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]], [[Darth Malgus|Malgus]]. The two apprentices battled each other as their Masters fought, but when Malgus ultimately knocked Shan to the floor, Darach stopped Malgus from killing Shan with a toss of his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], giving her [[Time/Legends|time]] to recover. [[Telekinesis/Legends|Summoning]] her lightsaber back to her hands, Shan tried to jump to her Master's aid, but Vindican stopped her with a blast of [[Force lightning/Legends|lightning]]. Darach threw his opponent across the hangar with the Force and rushed to his apprentice's side, and the ''Redshifter''{{'s}} attempt to lift off caused Vindican to blast the ship with lightning as well.<ref name=\"Return\" />\n\n[[File:Satele_senses_Darach.png|thumb|right|220px|Shan senses her Master's death.]]\nAt Darach's urging, Shan left her Master behind and boarded the ''Redshifter'' so that she could warn the Republic of the Empire's return, and she gave the Battlemaster her lightsaber as a parting gift before leaping aboard the smuggler's vessel with Malcom's help. Okarr urged both Malcom and Shan to man the ''Redshifter''{{'s}} [[Laser cannon/Legends|guns]], and the Padawan took the lower emplacement as the smuggler began to weave through<ref name=\"Return\" /> the [[Ashes of Korr]] [[asteroid belt]]<ref name=\"Korriban\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031002korriban|text=Korriban: Planet of Lost Souls|int=Korriban: Planet of Lost Souls|archivedate=20100221224446}}</ref> to escape the pursuing [[Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighter|Mark VI ''Supremacy''-class starfighters]]. However, as they were leaving the belt, Shan felt the death of her Master at the hands of Malgus.

She was present at the [[Jedi Temple]] when a contingent of Jedi, including the [[Kel Dor/Legends|Kel Dor]] [[Gnost-Dural]], departed the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] planet of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for the occupied Minos Cluster, and she witnessed the [[Coruscant riots (3680 BBY)|riots]] that broke out across Coruscant as a result.<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> Shan then spent the next part of the war partnered with various Jedi Masters before she was apprenticed to the [[Togruta/Legends|Togruta]] Jedi Master [[Dar'Nala]], who helped her become a full-fledged Jedi Knight.

However, the Empire [[Battle of Alderaan|invaded]] Alderaan while she was there,<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> and Shan raced to the [[Castle Panteer|royal palace]] in order to protect [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Silara Panteer]], though the structure was in ruins by the time she got there.<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> It was then that Shan had a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] showing her that Jace Malcom<ref name=\"Annihilation\">''[[The Old Republic: Annihilation]]''</ref>&mdash;whose [[Squad/Legends|unit]], [[Havoc Squad]], was training injured troopers on Alderaan at the time<ref name=\"Gnost\" />&mdash;would need reinforcements. Shan and Malcom had worked together on previous missions, and the soldier had tried to pursue a relationship with her, though she refrained from doing so because of the Order's restrictions on attachments.

Unleashing a powerful [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetic blast]] into the ground before killing the three disoriented Sith, Shan located Malgus nearby and drew her lightsaber as a challenge to her opponent. The Jedi then vaulted across the battlefield, destroying an [[Imperial C-series war droid|Imperial war droid]] and eliminating four Sith in the process before engaging Malgus in a fierce [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]]. After a series of blows, Shan was forced to her knees as she tried to hold back Malgus's blade, though she reached out with the Force and brought down a nearby [[Tree/Legends|tree]] to grant herself a reprieve. The two then continued their duel atop the fallen tree branch before Malgus threw her against another tree trunk with the Force, and Shan was barely able to somersault over the Sith Lord's head before Malgus buried his lightsaber in the tree where she had been moments earlier. However, Malgus quickly spun and [[Sun djem/Legends|sliced]] her double-bladed saber in two before she could spin it and attack, and he immediately followed up with a stab directly at her chest. The energy of the lightsaber used by Malgus was which [[Tutaminis|absorbed]] by Shan, who blocked the attack with her bare hands.<ref name=\"Hope\" />\n\n[[File:Force_Burst.png|thumb|right|240px|Shan brings down the cliff upon Malgus.]]\nMalgus's attack was interrupted when Malcom charged the Sith Lord with a ferocious yell, catching him about the waist and engaging in a short [[Unarmed combat|fistfight]] before revealing the primed [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] in his [[Limb/Legends|hand]]. The explosion threw the [[Commando/Legends|commando]] backward out of the clearing, though a scarred Malgus was able to withstand most of the explosion with the Force. Yet before the Sith Lord could pursue either Shan or Malcom, Shan gathered the Force (likely from the energy previously absorbed through tutaminis) and unleashed [[Force Burst|a powerful blast]] that sent Malgus flying into a nearby cliff side. The Sith Lord continued to fight against her [[Force power/Legends|power]] as she pinned him against the cliff, and Shan gathered her strength into a second and more powerful blast that tore the entire cliff to pieces. With her enemy buried under [[Metric ton/Legends|tons]] of rubble, Shan joined an injured Malcom in surveying the battlefield, and the commando sent up a [[Flare/Legends|flare]] to signal victory, one of many that began to light the surface of Alderaan as the reinforcements Shan had requested arrived in the [[Alderaan system/Legends|system]].<ref name=\"Hope\" />\n\nMalcom was given [[Kolto/Legends|kolto]] treatments to deal with his injuries, the most prominent of which left him with a permanently scarred face. Shan visited him later while the Republic forces were celebrating their victory, and she informed Malcom of the vision that had brought her to his aid. In response to Malcom's questions about Malgus, Shan confided in him her belief that the Sith Lord had survived the battle. Malcom then reminded Shan of his feelings for her, and her attempts to remind the soldier of her vows as a Jedi were not enough to suppress the feelings she had for him in return. Succumbing to her emotions, she and Malcom entered into a secret relationship&mdash;one that led to her becoming pregnant around six [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after the Battle of Alderaan, not long after Malcom had been promoted to the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[General/Legends|general]].<ref name=\"Annihilation\" /> In addition to working with [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Elin Garza]] to develop the Special Forces Division,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Malcom was conducting a [[Campaign near Gell Mattar|campaign]] near the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Gell Mattar]] on a [[Unidentified planet (Gell Mattar)|planet]] with Shan, and she decided to speak with him about his desire for vengeance against the Empire before informing him of her pregnancy. Their conversation revealed that Malcom's hatred of the Empire was his driving force, and Shan was forced to confront the possibility that she would turn to the dark side if the Empire caused Malcom's death. That fear, and the fear of the darkness within Malcom's spirit, drove Shan to break off their relationship and make plans to give up her child&mdash;as she understood that having them in her life put the Republic at risk.<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\n[[File:Baby_Theron.png|thumb|left|240px|Shan gives her son to Ngani Zho.]]\nFor the next few months, Shan continued to serve on the front lines as one of the Republic's greatest heroes, inspiring the rank and file of the Republic Military to victory on battlefields across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. However, as her pregnancy advanced and her [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]] were no longer able to conceal the signs, Shan went to her first Master, Ngani Zho, and told him of her pregnancy&mdash;but not of the father's name. Zho did not question her story and immediately agreed to help, approaching the Jedi Council and the Republic Military's leaders with the story that he had sent her on a vital and clandestine mission. Shan bore her son with Zho's help on a [[Unidentified planet (Theron Shan)|planet]] far from the war, and Zho took her child to raise on his own as per their agreement&mdash;but not before she named her son [[Theron Shan|Theron]].<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\n====Hero of the Republic====\n{{Quote|And the last&hellip; Satele Shan, guardian of the Republic, whose words inspired armies.

However, the fleet was ambushed in the Outer Rim Territories by the [[Imperial Navy (Sith Empire)|Imperial Navy]], sparking a [[Standard week/Legends|week]]-long [[Battle of Hoth (Great Galactic War)|battle]] that crossed several [[Star system/Legends|star systems]] before reaching its peak in the [[Hoth system/Legends|Hoth system]].

However, Mekhis refused, and the two began a fierce duel that resulted in Mekhis being grievously injured before she escaped.<ref name=\"Lost Suns 1\" />\n\nNot long after the Battle of Rhen Var, the Empire approached the Republic with a surprising offer of peace in [[3653 BBY]]. As a gesture of good faith, the Empire withdrew its forces from the Minos Cluster, and the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] agreed to peace negotiations on Alderaan. A Republic delegation led by the [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Paran Am-Ris]] traveled to Alderaan, accompanied by several Jedi: Shan, Dar'Nala,<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 1\" /> Syo Bakarn, and [[Aryn Leneer]].<ref name=\"Deceived novel\">''[[The Old Republic: Deceived]]''</ref> Shan spent the first morning in meditation, though her efforts were not enough to conceal the tension she felt at the conference, and she confided in her former teacher that she believed there was something more to the meeting than the Council believed.

Baras blocked her strike with his own blade and cautioned her to restrain herself before explaining to Am-Ris that the peace talks would proceed as planned&mdash;only the Republic would have to agree to the Empire's terms while the Imperials held their capital hostage. At Dar'Nala's urging, Shan reluctantly disengaged and exited the room with the rest of the Republic delegation<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 1\" />&mdash;only to find Leneer embroiled in a fight with the two Sith members of the Empire delegation who had been waiting outside.

The two were aboard the Republic ship ''[[Envoy/Legends|Envoy]]'' in the [[Kuat sector/Legends|Kuat sector]], conversing in their suite, when Dar'Nala detected an eavesdropper outside in the hall&mdash;the Imperial [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[SP-99]], which had been assigned to the vessel in order to ensure the fulfillment of the Treaty's terms. The Togruta Jedi Master then departed for the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] in anger as Shan settled down to [[Sleep/Legends|sleep]]. Shan was still in her room<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 1\" /> when Dar'Nala arranged for the ''Envoy'' to [[Attack on the Envoy|attack]] a passing Imperial [[Transport/Legends|transport]], as part of a plan to dismantle the Treaty and restart the war.<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 3\">''[[The Old Republic, Threat of Peace Act 3: Uncertain Surrender]]''</ref> Shan was alerted to the Imperials' returning fire by SP-99, and her attempt to investigate led her straight into a pair of Imperial commandos, who tried to kill her on sight. Quickly dispatching the attackers and ignoring SP-99's protests, the Jedi raced to find Dar'Nala, only to witness her capture by several Imperials. The Togruta ordered her former student to run and warn the Council, and Shan raced to an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] with SP-99 before the Imperials could capture her as well.<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 1\" />\n\nA [[Unidentified Mandalorian raider vessel|Mandalorian raider vessel]] bound for the [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]] [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] markets eventually found the escape pod in the [[Barma sector/Legends|Barma sector]], but a [[Rendaran-class assault shuttle|''Rendaran''-class assault shuttle]] piloted by Jedi Master [[Orgus Din]] and [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Harron Tavus]] located the pod's [[Distress signal/Legends|distress signal]] and destroyed the slavers before they could capture Shan. The Jedi Knight told them her story immediately upon being rescued, and Din decided that Zym needed to be alerted right away. Tavus laughed down Shan's argument that they should also rescue Dar'Nala, but Din agreed that they did need more information on the attack before they could make a judgment. They contacted the Grand Master from their ship, but Shan was dismayed to learn that an intercepted Imperial transmission had reported that Dar'Nala was dead. Saddened by the loss of her former Master, Shan accompanied the two on their original mission to enforce the ceasefire on the nearby planet [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]], where Din forced his former student [[Fortris Gall]] to withdraw from the battlefield. After completing their mission on Balmorra, they prepared to go to Dantooine, but Shan's request to lead the mission was turned down by Din, who was planning to remain on Balmorra while Gall and Tavus went to Dantooine with Shan.<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 2\">''[[The Old Republic, Threat of Peace Act 2: New Galactic Order]]''</ref>\n\nAs they were traveling through the [[Raioballo sector/Legends|Raioballo sector]], Tavus approached Shan with the possibility of starting a romantic relationship, but Shan reminded the lieutenant of her vows as a Jedi. Their conversation was interrupted by SP-99, who reported their arrival at Dantooine, and Tavus informed Shan that the offer still stood if she changed her mind. Meeting with [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Dael]] at [[Base D-55]] on Dantooine, the two were dismayed to learn from Am-Ris that Grand Master Zym had been killed&mdash;just as a bomb [[Bombing of the Senate Tower|exploded]] in the [[Senate Building]]. With the Treaty of Coruscant crumbling under the strain of recent events, Am-Ris reiterated his order to withdraw to Dael and ended the [[Holomessage/Legends|holotransmission]] with the hope that Shan and Tavus would succeed in convincing the major to heed the orders. To Shan's surprise, Tavus did not object to Dael's refusal, and the lieutenant decided to return to their ship until Shan came to her senses and realized that the Treaty was not worth protecting. Despite Tavus's departure, Shan remained committed to the mission, and she stayed behind to speak with Dael.<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 2\" />\n\n[[File:Dantooine_skirmish_JMGD.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Shan engages Darth Baras in combat alongside Dar'Nala.]]\nA little while later, Din arrived on Dantooine with the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Braden]], whom he had captured on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Upon learning Shan's name, Braden delivered the message that Dar'Nala had tasked him with before her death&mdash;Dar'Nala believed that the Treaty was being sabotaged by Darth Baras. This confused Shan, who had sensed that Baras was more committed to the Treaty than Dar'Nala had been on Alderaan, and she returned to the ship to find Tavus. To her surprise, Shan found only a heavily damaged SP-99, as Tavus had shot the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] after discovering it spying on him. The protocol droid was barely able to communicate before losing power that Tavus had gone to the ruins of the [[Jedi Enclave]], and Din called Shan just then to report that Braden had escaped. Din ordered her to remain there until he arrived, but Shan decided to pursue Tavus herself and set off for the Enclave. Following the Force, Shan entered the [[Crystal Cave (Dantooine)|Crystal Cave]] near the Enclave to find a fierce [[Skirmish in the Ancient Crystal Cave|firefight]] in progress. Angral, Baras, and several [[Imperial soldier|Sith troopers]] were battling Tavus, Gall, a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] bounty hunter named [[Dalborra]], and&mdash;to Shan's astonishment&mdash;Dar'Nala. Surprised to see her former teacher alive, Shan nonetheless joined the Togruta in her fight against Baras.<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 3\" />\n\nBaras revealed that one of the Treaty's purposes was to show the Jedi their own hypocrisy and hatred of the Sith, and Dar'Nala proved his point by admitting that she [[Dar'Nala's conspiracy|had been behind]] both the attack on the ''Envoy'' and the Senate bombing. Baras then tried to convince Shan to join the Sith, claiming that she belonged on the other side of the war&mdash;but Shan broke away, realizing that the Sith were manipulating her and the others to continue the war. Calling out to Tavus, who had pinned an unarmed Angral to the ground and was preparing to execute him, she warned him to stop. An enraged Dar'Nala leaped at the soldier when he refused to kill the Sith, and she knocked aside Gall when the confused Jedi blocked her attack. The fallen Jedi Master ordered Dalborra, who was under her mental control, to kill Gall, but the Wookiee instead broke free of her thrall and slew Dar'Nala with a single blow to the head. Shan rushed to Dar'Nala's side as Dalborra fled the cave, and Angral took advantage of his opponents' distraction to summon his lightsaber back to his hand and throw Tavus across the cave with the Force. The Sith prepared to continue their battle, but Shan held back her allies and informed Angral that their fight was ended. Baras agreed with Shan and departed with his fellow Sith but not before warning the Jedi Knight that Sith was in her heritage&mdash;the dark side was the destiny of all the heirs of Revan. Returning to the surface, the trio explained what had transpired in the [[Cave/Legends|caves]] to Din, though none of the three mentioned many details or explained Dar'Nala's role in the recent events. Din was suspicious but satisfied, and he accepted their story on account of their promise that the Treaty would not be disrupted any further.<ref name=\"Threat of Peace 3\" />\n\n====Grand Master of the Order====\n{{Quote|I am simply tired.

During this period, she ended the [[Eberon\u2013Kashyyyk War]] and had made an enemy of an individual named [[Thresh-ahantu Azuloz]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Finally, in [[3651 BBY]],<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> the Force revealed a previously lost [[Tython hyperlane|hyperspace route]] that led Shan far into the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]]<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" />&mdash;where she discovered the Order's long-lost homeworld of [[Tython/Legends|Tython]].<ref name=\"Holonet\" /> For her achievement,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Shan was granted the rank of Jedi Master and given a place on the Jedi Council, and it was not long after her appointment that the Order was informed that the Jedi Temple on Coruscant would not be rebuilt. In light of the news, the Council decided that the Order would move its headquarters to Tython. By [[3645 BBY]], the Council had appointed Shan as the Order's Grand Master, and she guided the Jedi throughout the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] as they rebuilt their ranks and recovered from the fighting.<ref name=\"Gnost\" /> Sometime during that period of time, she took on a young [[Kiffar/Legends|Kiffar]] named [[Shigar Konshi]] as her Padawan.<ref name=\"Fatal Alliance\" />\n\nAround [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"Time Oteg\">''[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance]]'' indicates that [[Oric Traless]] only recently joined the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]], and ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]'' states that Oteg recently stepped down from the Council. As the rest of the Council members who appear in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' are confirmed to have been appointed at the beginning of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] or earlier, Oteg is the only viable option for Traless to replace, and that means that Oteg stepped down before the events of ''Fatal Alliance'' in [[3643 BBY]].</ref> Supreme Chancellor [[Dorian Janarus]] approached the Council with the request that Master [[Oteg]] assume a position as [[Fleet Admiral/Legends|Fleet Admiral]]. After meditating on the matter, Shan decided that Oteg would play a pivotal role in the upcoming conflict, and she agreed to Janarus's request. Oteg's seat on the Jedi High Council was taken<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> by [[Oric Traless]], and sometime afterward, Shan and Konshi were on Coruscant to meet with General Elin Garza and the Republic's [[Stantorrs|Supreme Commander]] when the Council deemed her Padawan unfit to take the Jedi Trials. Sensing her Padawan's disappointment and conflicted emotions, she told him to take a walk while she went to her meeting. However, Konshi soon found himself caught up in a [[Lightfight|firefight]] with an [[Armor/Legends|armored]] Mandalorian named [[Dao Stryver]]. Stryver escaped despite the efforts of Konshi and the Republic trooper [[Larin Moxla]], but Moxla had learned that Stryver was seeking something called the [[Cinzia]] and a person named [[Lema Xandret]]. Konshi immediately reported these events to his Master, who relayed them to the [[Supreme Commander]] before contacting Tython regarding her earlier meeting. She later met with Konshi near the [[Galactic Justice Center]], where she gave her apprentice all of the information that the [[Republic Strategic Information Service]] had gathered on the Cinzia and Xandret&mdash;the ''Cinzia'' was a ship that the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Tassaa Bareesh]] was offering for auction, and Xandret was somehow involved in the ship's history. Sensing that Konshi had set something in motion, the Grand Master decided to send her apprentice and Moxla to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] to investigate the auction.<ref name=\"Fatal Alliance\" />\n\nKonshi's mission uncovered the existence of droids known as [[Fastbreeder|hexes]], [[Battle droid/Legends|combat droids]] that the ''Cinzia'' had been carrying, and Bareesh's auction collapsed when the droids were released and began to wreak havoc. The Padawan and Moxla were able to escape Nal Hutta with the Republic envoy [[Ula Vii]] and the smuggler [[Jet Nebula]] aboard Nebula's ship, ''[[Auriga Fire]]'', and Konshi contacted his Master to seek guidance on what to do next. Shan was troubled by two aspects of her apprentice's report: The droids were adaptable in combat, and a Sith apprentice named [[Eldon Ax]] had been present at [[Tassaa Bareesh's palace]] during the fighting. As Konshi was planning to use his [[Psychometry/Legends|psychometry]] to track the source of the hexes, Shan gathered a Republic task force and traveled to a rendezvous at the planet [[Honoghr/Legends|Honoghr]]. Using his powers, Shan's apprentice tracked the hexes to a planet named [[Sebaddon]], which was located near a [[Black hole/Legends|black hole]], well above the galactic disk. Shan soon followed them to the [[Sebaddon system]] aboard the [[Corellia (starship)|''Corellia'']], a [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]] among the Republic flotilla under the command of Colonel [[Gurin]]. Shan attempted to contact Xandret's Sebaddon colonists three times before receiving a response&mdash;a woman's voice, saying they did not recognize the Republic's authority and that they wanted only to be left alone. As the conversation continued, Sebaddon launched eight [[Missile/Legends|missiles]] at the Republic fleet, and the Republic was only able to destroy seven of them before they hit the ''Corellia''.<ref name=\"Fatal Alliance\" />\n\nTo the Republic's dismay, the missiles were actually composed of thousands of hexes, and the \"destroyed\" projectiles quickly took control of several Republic vessels. The section of the ''Corellia'' in which Shan had been in was largely intact, and the Grand Master was able to seal herself within a pressurized section of the ship. She reached out to her Padawan to convey her situation, and Konshi used one of the ''Auriga Fire''{{'s}} [[enviro-suit]]s to reach her. While waiting for Konshi to find her, the Grand Master encountered nine hexes, but she was able to influence a biological component in them to halt their aggression. However, she was unable to make the hexes leave, which forced her Padawan to walk carefully through the hexes to let the Grand Master out. Shan used a [[Force barrier/Legends|Force shield]] to keep the air around her while Konshi cut them a path out of the ship's wreckage. After Konshi rescued Shan, the Mandalorian Stryver contacted the ''Auriga Fire'' with instructions to meet him on a nearby [[Moon/Legends|moon]].<ref name=\"Fatal Alliance\" />\n\n[[File:Darth_Chratis_Sebaddon.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Darth Chratis and Shan exchanged apprentices for the mission to Sebaddon's surface.]]\nShan and Konshi met with Stryver on the ''[[First Blood]]'', his personal ship, and they were surprised to encounter the Sith apprentice from Nal Hutta there as well. Stryver explained that the hexes' creator, Lema Xandret, had originally approached the Mandalorians with her droids in hopes of forming an alliance to bring down the Sith Empire. Xandret's droids had intrigued [[Mandalore the Vindicated]], but the Mandalorians soon realized that the hexes were, in fact, a galactic plague&mdash;Xandret had lost control of her droids not long after she contacted the Mandalorians, and the droids' drive to consume and their incredible replication speed would allow them to destroy the entire galaxy within a matter of years. That was the reason that Stryver had called the Empire and the Republic to Sebaddon: Only together could the two galactic powers destroy the scourge of the hexes and ensure the galaxy's safety. Though both sides initially objected to such an alliance, they eventually agreed to a temporary cessation of hostilities in order to eliminate the hexes. As part of the joint assault, Shan led a strike team to destroy the hexes' coordinating intelligence while another team led by Moxla took out the main [[Factory/Legends|factory]]. Despite her apprehensions, Shan accepted the demands of [[Darth Chratis]]&mdash;the Sith Lord in command of the Imperial force&mdash;that she would take his apprentice with her while he took Konshi on his own mission.<ref name=\"Fatal Alliance\" />\n\nAs the battle began, Shan and the rest of the allied forces dropped onto Sebaddon's surface using [[jet-chute]]s, though she soon began to tail Eldon Ax in order to speak with Chratis's apprentice. Once the allied troopers found an entrance to the [[Sebaddon hex facility|coordinating intelligence's complex]], the Grand Master led the charge into the facility, destroying hundreds of hexes with both the Force and her lightsaber. Yet the joint task force soon realized that it was unable to penetrate the complex's main structure to reach its target, so Shan had her allies withdraw so that something else could do the work for them&mdash;a crippled transport was heading straight for the complex. The transport breached a subterranean [[Mining/Legends|mining]] complex beneath the facility, but an explosion of what seemed to be [[Magma/Legends|lava]] consumed both Shan and Ax before they could get out of the way. To their surprise, the two discovered that it was not lava; it was a lake of warm, reddish fluid that concealed an Imperial vessel far beneath its surface. Shan and Ax boarded the ship to find a massive [[Glass/Legends|glass]] tank containing the same red fluid in one of the vessel's compartments, and they soon realized that the fluid was some kind of organic material that gave the hexes a semblance of life&mdash;and that the tank contained a [[Cinzia Xandret|clone]] of Eldon Ax.<ref name=\"Fatal Alliance\" />\n\nThe [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] explained to Shan that Eldon Ax was actually Xandret's daughter, a fact that the Sith apprentice had concealed, and that the fluid in which she was submerged was suppressing her Force powers. Further conversation with the clone revealed that Xandret had infused the droids with her own intelligence, but the remnant of Xandret within the fluid killed the clone when she tried to shut down the hex droids. With her dying words, the clone instructed Ax on how to take control of the hexes, and Shan and Ax returned to the surface to test whether it would work. Ax's control of the hexes allowed her to end the battle in a matter of [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]], and Shan retreated with the rest of the Republic forces as Ax used the hexes to kill her Master before destroying them and ending the threat they posed to the galaxy. In the aftermath of the conflict, which was labeled [[Independent Operation Sebaddon]], Shan proudly stood by as her Padawan was deemed ready for the Jedi Trials and returned to Tython with her student so that he could become a Jedi Knight.<ref name=\"Fatal Alliance\" />\n\n====Mysteries of Tython====\n{{GameLS|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n{{Quote|Taking a life affects the Living Force&mdash;and the one who does the killing.

However, Kalikori's resentment of the Jedi reached a peak when the villager [[Nalen Raloch]] was seduced to the dark side and driven insane by the [[Force ghost]] of [[Rajivari]], one of the founders of the Jedi Order and the instigator of the [[Force Wars]], which had ravaged Tython over 20,000 years earlier.<ref name=\"Rajivari's Legacy\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Consular|Rajivari's Legacy|Tython}}</ref> Fortunately for the Order, the [[The Barsen'thor|apprentice]] of Council member [[Yuon Par]] [[Duel at the Forge|defeated]] Raloch before he could destroy the [[Forge]], the ancient machine used by the Order's Padawans to construct lightsabers as part of their Trials, and the injured villager was brought to the [[Jedi Temple (Tython)/Legends|Jedi Temple]] for healing. Shan oversaw the man's treatment herself, and she later attended a Council meeting with Par, Par's Padawan, Jaric Kaedan, and Syo Bakarn. Taking the Padawan's advice into account, Shan and the rest of the Council began making overtures to Kalikori in an attempt to heal the rift between the villagers and the Jedi, and Raloch was taken in for Jedi training. Par's student was also elevated to a full Jedi of the Order, but Par herself collapsed halfway through the meeting. The Council and the Temple's healers discovered that she was suffering from a kind of sickness, and they decided to send her and her former Padawan to Coruscant in hopes that [[Jedi artifact/Legends|Jedi artifacts]] from the ruined Temple could aid Par's seemingly untreatable [[Dark Plague|illness]].<ref name=\"The Forge\" />\n\nAnother conflict eventually arose on Tython&mdash;this one involving the Flesh Raiders. When the Flesh Raiders invaded the [[Tythonian Gnarls]] region and attacked the [[Gnarls Outpost|Jedi outpost]] there, the Jedi were able to repel the natives' attack, but the assault ended when a [[Hero of Tython|young initiate]] [[Duel in the Gnarls cave|defeated]] the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Callef]], who was commanding the Flesh Raiders. Master Din sealed the [[Gnarls cave|cave]] that the Flesh Raiders were using to enter the Gnarls and ordered the apprentice to meet him at the Jedi Temple, but Shan learned of what had transpired in the Gnarls and contacted the student as the young Jedi arrived at the Temple. She asked the learner to meet her within her private chambers before the Council meeting, and she discussed the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] and the dangers of emotions with the student briefly before going to the Council chambers. In the meeting, Shan and the few Masters present were surprised when Din announced his intention to take on the apprentice who defeated Callef as his own Padawan, the first he had taught since his previous student, [[Bengel Morr]], who was believed to have been killed in the Sacking of Coruscant a decade earlier.<ref name=\"Attack of the Flesh Raiders\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Attack of the Flesh Raiders|Tython}}</ref> After contemplating a dark presence of which the Council had recently become aware, Shan came to believe that the source was on Coruscant, and she dispatched Master Kiwiiks and her Padawan, [[Kira Carsen]], to investigate.<ref name=\"Enemy Force\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Enemy Force|Tython}}</ref> However, over the next few days, Din and his new student uncovered the truth behind the Flesh Raiders' recent increase in attacks&mdash;they were being commanded by Morr, who had survived the destruction of the Jedi Temple and turned to the dark side.<ref name=\"Weapon of the Jedi\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Weapon of the Jedi|Tython}}</ref>\n{{Endgame}}\n\n[[File:Kiwiiks_message.png|thumb|left|210px|The Council listens to Kiwiiks' message.]]\nAfter the Padawan defeated Morr in [[Battle of the Forge|battle]] and rescued Din, who had been betrayed by the villagers of Kalikori and captured by Morr, Shan and the rest of the Council elevated the student to the rank of Jedi Knight. When the Grand Master asked for the newly promoted Knight's opinion on what should be done about the villagers, the young Jedi believed that the Order needed to openly aid the Twi'lek villagers so that Kalikori would not turn on them again. The meeting was interrupted by a priority call from Kiwiiks, who confirmed their suspicions that something malevolent was working on the capital, and Shan decided to send both Din and his former student to assist her.<ref name=\"Weapon of the Jedi\" />\n\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nThe Grand Master then accompanied a Republic Military convoy who was ferrying a high-level Imperial defector, codenamed [[the General]]. However, the convoy was ambushed by the Imperial Navy, forcing Shan to send the general ahead aboard the [[Thranta-class corvette|''Thranta''-class corvette]] ''[[Brentaal Star]]'' while her fleet fought off the attack. Yet Imperial [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Rycus Kilran]] learned of the ''Brentaal Star''{{'s}} location and sent the [[Gage-class transport|''Gage''-class transport]] ''[[Black Talon]]'' to attack the Republic vessel and recapture the defector. By the time Shan and the sixteen remaining vessels of her convoy were able to disengage from their attackers&mdash;crippling three Imperial dreadnaughts in the process&mdash;an Imperial strike team was preparing to board the damaged ''Brentaal Star'' and capture the general, and the Grand Master's requests that the Imperials withdraw and respect the Treaty of Coruscant went unheeded. Shan's convoy raced to the ''Brentaal Star''{{'s}} aid, but by the time she arrived, the Imperials had already eliminated the general, and the ''Black Talon'' was long gone.<ref name=\"Black Talon\">{{TORcite|type=flashpoint|The ''Black Talon''}}</ref>\n{{Endgame}}\n\nWhen the ''[[Voidstar]]'', a prototype Imperial warship lost during the first war, was rediscovered, Shan commanded the Republic forces that [[Battle aboard the Voidstar|fought for control]] of the warship.<ref name=\"Voidstar\">{{TORcite|type=warzone|''Voidstar''}}</ref>\n\nDuring that time, the Jedi on Coruscant had uncovered the source of the dark presence&mdash;a Sith Lord named [[Tarnis (Sith Lord)|Tarnis]], who had been posing as a top Republic [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] on the [[Planet Prison]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] project&mdash;and also learned that Tarnis had stolen files on all of the Republic's weapon projects to give to the Empire.

However, the Knight's defeat of Tarnis incurred the wrath of his father, Darth Angral, and the elder Sith Lord had promptly declared a personal war against the Republic and the Jedi in order to gain revenge for the death of his son. Din's old friend [[Var Suthra]], the general in charge of the Republic weapon projects, contacted Shan, who authorized the young Knight to work with Suthra to stop Angral's crusade. Shan also assigned Carsen as the Knight's own Padawan in the absence of Kiwiiks, and she wished the young Jedi luck as the two departed for [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] with their [[T7-series astromech droid|astromech droid]] ally, [[T7-O1]].<ref name=\"Race to the Ruins\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Race to the Ruins|Coruscant}}</ref>\n\n====Guiding the Order's heroes====\n[[File:Satele_hologram.png|thumb|right|180px|Grand Master Shan communicated via hologram with those who answered her summons and came to Carrick Station.]]\n{{Quote|You said your name was&mdash;''\"<br />\"''&mdash;classified.''\"<br />\"''&hellip; I see.

The [[Advozse Hegemony]], a [[Speciesism|xenophobic]] political faction of the [[Advozse/Legends|Advozsec]] people, had acquired a prototype [[Battlestation|battle station]] codenamed \"[[Hammer Station|Hammer]]\" that used [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroids]] to [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombard]] planetary surfaces. The station had been designed during the Great War but scuttled when the project's destructive potential was fully understood, and the prototype was set on [[Autopilot/Legends|autopilot]] to collide with a nearby [[White dwarf/Legends|white dwarf]]. However, a mechanical failure shut off the station's [[Engine/Legends|engines]] before it was destroyed, and the Hegemony had discovered it several months before. The station was brought to the Republic's attention when the Hegemony [[Bombardment of Skine|bombarded]] the [[Skine's capital city|capital city]] of the planet [[Skine]] after it refused to surrender, and Shan put out a call to as many Jedi and Republic heroes as were available. Gathering a small strike team aboard the Republic's staging area of [[Carrick Station]], the Grand Master briefed the team on the situation and dispatched it to infiltrate the Hammer above [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]]. However, Darth Malgus, Shan's opposite number in the Empire, had gathered a strike team to destroy the station at the same time, and only one of the two teams was successful in their attack on the station.<ref name=\"Hammer Station\" />\n\nA short time later, another crisis arose&mdash;but one that involved a powerful threat from the dark side. An [[Archaeology/Legends|archaeological]] survey team was excavating Sith ruins on the planet [[Athiss/Legends|Athiss]] when the Order received a distress signal from the planet that coincided with the Council's sudden sensation of an intense disturbance in the Force. Summoning several powerful Jedi and other trusted allies, Shan dispatched a strike team to Athiss to investigate. The Republic strike team competed with an Imperial strike force to recover the Sith artifacts and contain the dark side threat. The two strike teams combined to eliminate the primitive worshipers of the Sith Lord [[Vodal Kressh]], who had been exiled to Athiss by the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor]] [[Standard century/Legends|centuries]] ago, and the destruction of Kressh's servants ended the possibility of his influence spreading out into the larger galaxy.<ref name=\"Athiss\">{{TORcite|type=flashpoint|Athiss}}</ref> Shan was still on Tython when Din's former student and Carsen arrived to reveal that Carsen was a native of the Empire. The two had been pursuing Angral's agents across the galaxy when they were lured into a trap by a Sith named [[Valis]] in order to capture her, and Carsen had revealed her past to her Master after they [[Duel at the Czerka mining facility|defeated]] the Sith. After Shan gathered the few Council members who were on Tython at the time, Carsen explained her tale in full: Born on Dromund Kaas to Sith parents, she had been raised at the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]] on Korriban and was a [[Children of the Emperor|Child of the Emperor]]&mdash;a servant of the Sith [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] who would have been bound to the Emperor's will if Carsen had not escaped before the process was completed. Master Kaedan immediately called for Carsen's [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisonment]], but [[Tol Braga]] disagreed&mdash;the Council had first learned of the Children's existence from his own Padawan, [[Sajar]], a former Dark Councillor whom Braga had turned to the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side of the Force]]. While the conversation was ongoing, Shan reached out and probed Carsen with the Force, only to find no trace of the dark side within her. Carsen's teacher convinced the Grand Master that the Padawan would never betray the Order, so Shan decided to allow Carsen to remain a Jedi.<ref name=\"Defector\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|The Defector|the Abandoned Mining Facility}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Theron's_mommy_issues.png|thumb|left|200px|Neither Satele nor Theron openly acknowledged their relationship.]]\nShan returned to her chambers in the Jedi Temple to find that she was not alone. Sensing her visitor in the Force, she asked him to reveal himself and was greeted by a tall, dark-[[Hair/Legends|haired]] man with a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] implant above one of his [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Informing the Grand Master that Master Zho was dead, he gave her the man's lightsaber and told Shan that he had died saving others. However, Shan recognized something in the man and realized that he was actually her son, Theron, though her visitor did not show any signs of recognizing her before he departed.<ref name=\"Lost Suns 5\">''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 5]]''</ref> Sometime later, the Republic alerted Shan to the theft of the ''[[Allusis]]'', a highly-advanced [[Valor-class cruiser|''Valor''-class cruiser]] that had been undergoing refits at the [[Fondor Shipyards/Legends|Fondor Shipyards]], and she gathered a strike team to reclaim the vessel from the Mandalorian [[Clan Varad]], which was using it to pillage and raid the planets of the [[Tamarin sector]]. As the Empire was attempting to destroy the ''Allusis'' after Clan Varad attacked several Imperial planets, Shan led a Republic fleet to engage both the Mandalorians and the Imperial fleet while her strike team&mdash;a four-man group consisting of the [[Jedi Consular]] [[Magnus (Jedi)|Magnus]], the Jedi Knight [[Ezeraline]], a smuggler named [[Taklan]], and a Republic trooper named [[Keenor]]&mdash;boarded the ''Allusis'' and attempted to take control of the vessel. However, the team was opposed by an Imperial strike force that included the Sith [[Rotham]] and [[Vincine]], a bounty hunter named [[Kyrenic]], and an Imperial agent named [[Andan]], and only one of the teams survived the battle and captured the ''Allusis'' for its side.<ref name=\"Mandalorian Raiders\">{{TORcite|type=flashpoint|Mandalorian Raiders}}</ref>\n\nYet another crisis also arose on the planet [[Cademimu V]], a missile depot that supplied Republic defenses on worlds along the [[Celanon Spur/Legends|Celanon Spur]] trade route, when the planet's corrupt [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Chornarov]] declared his independence before the Republic could begin investigations into his actions. With the help of the [[Mantellian Separatist Movement]], which had recently been forced off Ord Mantell at the end of the [[Separatist War]], Chornarov declared martial law and had the Separatist General [[Ortol]] deploy his troops to seize control. The governor also took control of the planet's missile depots, ensuring that neither the Republic nor the Empire could launch an invasion, so both Shan and Darth Malgus dispatched strike teams to infiltrate Cademimu and shut down the weapons. Both the Empire and the Republic sent fleets to the [[Cademimu system]] to ensure they could take control quickly, but only one galactic power was successful in taking the missile depots and conquering the planet.<ref name=\"Cademimu\">{{TORcite|type=flashpoint|Cademimu}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Jedi chapter house (Rhinnal)|Jedi enclave]] on [[Rhinnal/Legends|Rhinnal]] was [[Attack on Rhinnal|attacked]] by an Imperial warship and the Republic [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] ''[[Toron Voq]]'' was destroyed trying to investigate, the Republic believed that the Empire had attacked and broken the Treaty. Shan was deeply affected by the attack on the enclave, as she sensed the simultaneous deaths of many Jedi. However, an intercepted coded transmission from Malgus to the Dark Council revealed that the [[Lord Senu's fortress|fortress]] of a Sith Lord named [[Senu]] and [[Unidentified Sith fortress|another fortress]] had [[Destruction of Lord Senu's fortress|suffered]] a [[Destruction of a Sith fortress|similar fate]]; the message also identified the attacker as the ''[[Red Reaper]]'', the [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] of the [[Sith (species)/Legends|Sith Pureblood]] [[Darth Ikoral]]. Ikoral desired to purge the galaxy of all non-Purebloods, and, as the ''Red Reaper'' was detected near the [[Agriworld/Legends|agricultural world]] [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], Shan immediately dispatched a Republic strike team to board the vessel and defeat Ikoral just as Malgus did the same.

Fortunately for the Order, Din's former Padawan had discovered Uphrades not long after Angral's departure, and General Suthra relayed Shan's distress signal to the Jedi Knight. Along with Carsen and T7-O1, the Knight was able to board the ''Oppressor'' above Tython and disable the Desolator, allowing the Order to launch its fighters. By the time that the Knight and Carsen [[Battle of the Oppressor|defeated]] Angral on the ''Oppressor''{{'s}} bridge, Jedi starfighters were beginning bombing runs that tore apart the warship and permanently ended the threat of the Desolator. When the Knight and Carsen returned to Tython's surface, Shan learned that the Emperor himself had tried to take control of the former Child, but Carsen had severed the link between them permanently, and the Grand Master promoted the Padawan to the rank of Jedi Knight as a result.

As part of Braga's plan, the Jedi Knight [[Jomar Chul]] scouted the [[Dromund system]], though he was pursued and shot down over the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Chul was rescued by the Hero of Tython, who had been drawn to Chul's location by the instructions of Orgus Din's Force ghost, and Shan and Braga ordered the Hero to bring Chul's [[Sensor/Legends|sensor]] logs to Tython while the Zabrak Jedi awaited medical aid. The Grand Master authorized Braga's mission and allowed the Jedi Master to recruit the Hero for the strike team,<ref name=\"Guided by the Force\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Guided by the Force|Tatooine}}</ref> but as the strike team completed its preparations, Chul experienced a Force vision that the Hero would fall to the dark side.

True to Chul's vision, the Emperor turned the entire group to the dark side and trained them as his servants for months.<ref name=\"Descent\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Descent|the Emperor's Fortress}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Council_Meet_Scourge.png|thumb|left|220px|Lord Scourge explains his past to Grand Master Shan and the Council.]]\nThe Hero only escaped the Emperor thanks to the Din's ghost and the unlikely aid of the [[Emperor's Wrath]], Lord [[Scourge (Sith)|Scourge]], who freed the Knight's companions and promised to explain his actions on Tython. There, before the Council, the Sith Lord revealed his past: Centuries earlier, he had foreseen the destruction of the galaxy at the hands of the Emperor, and the vision had shown that only the Hero was capable of stopping the Emperor. The Emperor was attempting to repeat the [[Sith Emperor's ritual|dark side ritual]] that had granted him [[Immortality/Legends|immortality]] over a thousand years earlier but on a galactic scale, a feat that would kill every living thing in the galaxy. However, the Emperor required a sacrifice of billions of simultaneous deaths, and Scourge urged the Hero and the Council to halt the Sith's plans on the [[Prison/Legends|prison]] planet of [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]]. To Kaedan's shock, Shan decided that Scourge's help was essential in stopping the Emperor, and she allowed the Sith Lord to accompany the Hero to Belsavis<ref name=\"Unthinkable\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|An Unthinkable Alliance|the Emperor's Fortress}}</ref> while the Grand Master sent a Jedi named [[Enna Tabord]] ahead to investigate.<ref name=\"Anarchy\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Anarchy|Belsavis}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the Hero arrived at Belsavis, Shan's investigations had identified there the presence of a high-ranking servant of the Emperor, [[Executor (Sith Empire rank)|Executor]] [[Krannus]]. Scourge confirmed that Krannus was likely the Emperor's intended agent of destruction, and the Grand Master gave Tabord's coordinates to the Hero so that the Knight could meet the other Jedi on the surface.<ref name=\"Anarchy\" /> She also attempted to notify the prison administration of the Knight's presence on Belsavis, but the chaos resulting from the [[Invasion of Belsavis|Imperial attack]] on the planet prevented Shan from making contact until she located Colonel [[Bartaph]], the [[Republic officer/Legends|Republic officer]] in charge of the military reinforcements that had been dispatched to secure the prison. Bartaph was able to send a [[Bedd's unit|Special Forces squad]] under [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Bedd]] to reinforce the Hero in a final battle with Krannus, helping the Knight prevent Krannus from destroying the entire planet.<ref name=\"Holocaust\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Holocaust|Belsavis}}</ref> Upon learning of the Knight's victory on Belsavis, Shan dispatched the Hero to the Imperial space station [[Korriban's Flame]] to investigate rumors of a meeting between high-ranking Sith and also to find Jomar Chul, who had disappeared on a [[Mission to the Korriban's Flame|previous mission]].<ref name=\"Fallen\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Fallen|the Korriban's Flame}}</ref>\n\nSenator [[Tobas Grell]] of the planet [[Sarkhai]], a member of the [[Rift Alliance]] splinter government, was kidnapped above Belsavis by a man named [[Stark]]. The former student of Yuon Par, who had been granted the title of [[Barsen'thor]]&mdash;Warden of the Order&mdash;and the rank of Jedi Master after resolving the earlier crisis involving the Force-induced plague that had afflicted Par and other Jedi Masters, investigated Grell's kidnapping with his daughter, [[Nadia Grell|Nadia]], but the two were too late to prevent his death. Upon learning of the death of Grell, who had been an ally of the Jedi Order even after the Rift Alliance's split with the Republic, Shan convened the Council to offer the Order's condolences to Nadia and the Rift Alliance. Master Bakarn also displayed the Senator's will, which included a request that the Barsen'thor take on Nadia as a Padawan, and Shan informed the Consular that she and the Council had decided to approve Grell's request.

However, the presence of several signal scramblers in the area prevented the Jedi from tracking Fulminiss' precise location, so the Grand Master sent the Hero to disable the scramblers upon arrival.<ref name=\"Mysterious World\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Mysterious World|Voss}}</ref> The Knight pursued Fulminiss across the planet in a race to prevent him from unleashing a plague of madness upon the world, but the Hero was ultimately able to defeat the Sith Lord before his plans came to fruition.

Upon learning of the reason for the request, Shan immediately granted the Consular remote access to the Archives' systems. However, the recording showed a terrible truth&mdash;the First Son was none other than Syo Bakarn, Shan's friend and fellow Council member. When contacted, the First Son revealed that he had suppressed Bakarn's personality and had granted control of the fortresses known as [[Guardian Holds]] to his fellow Children, and the First Son cruelly thanked Shan and Kaedan for their gift before terminating the call. Horrified, Shan and Kaedan watched as communications with the Holds vanished, and the two Jedi Masters ordered the Barsen'thor to retake the Holds with the Alliance's forces.<ref name=\"Descent2\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Consular|Descent|Corellia}}</ref> The Barsen'thor was successful in these efforts and also managed to defeat the First Son in a final duel, during which Bakarn broke free of the Son's control and locked the Child away within his mind. At the moment of the First Son's defeat, Shan and the rest of the Masters suddenly became aware of the presence of the Children across the galaxy&mdash;without the First Son's shield, the Children were exposed to the Jedi. Shan was also glad to hear that Bakarn had survived, and she immediately sent Jedi to retrieve her friend and return him to Tython after conveying Supreme Chancellor [[Leontyne Saresh]]'s request for a meeting to the Barsen'thor.<ref name=\"Chaos and Harmony\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Consular|Chaos and Harmony|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Satele_Shan_Holo.png|thumb|left|200px|Grand Master Satele Shan]]\nAt the same time the Barsen'thor was reclaiming the Holds, the Outer Rim Jedi under the Hero of Tython's leadership foiled each of Braga's attempts to supply the Emperor with the necessary sacrifice for his ritual, and the Hero was finally able to defeat and redeem Braga aboard the warship [[Eclipse (Harrower-class)|''Eclipse'']] above Corellia's capital of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]]. From Braga, the Knight learned that the Emperor was weakened and that he was in the structure known as the [[Dark Temple]] on Dromund Kaas,<ref name=\"Mutual Assured Destruction\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Mutual Assured Destruction|Corellia}}</ref> and Shan decided to pursue a radical course of action&mdash;while the Hero infiltrated the Imperial capital and confronted the Emperor, she would lead the Republic Navy in an all-out [[Dromund Kaas operation|assault]] on the planet. While the Hero traveled from Corellia to the heart of the [[Sith Worlds]], the Grand Master departed Tython and joined the invasion fleet that had been gathered at her request, and her task force arrived at Dromund Kaas and engaged the Imperial [[First Defense Fleet]] in a furious [[Space warfare|space battle]]. With Shan and Admiral Dabrin leading the fleet at the head of the ''Valiant'', their ships caught the Imperial defenders by surprise and kept the planet's attention firmly on them, allowing the Hero to slip down to the surface and enter the Dark Temple with the aid of the Jedi's compatriots. Together with T7-O1, the Hero confronted and defeated the Emperor in a final battle, and the Knight immediately communicated success to Shan upon returning to the group's ship.

Malcom soon became aware of his son, Theron, while working with the Strategic Information Service on [[Operation End Game]], a joint operation between the military, SIS, and the Jedi Order to take down the powerful Imperial warship ''[[Ascendant Spear]]'' and its commander, [[Darth Karrid]]. Upon seeing Theron's name on an analysis report, as Theron was an agent for the SIS, Malcom attempted to reconcile with his son but was initially rebuffed. After Theron and Master Gnost-Dural returned from a [[Mission to Ziost|mission]] to the planet [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]], Shan contacted Gnost-Dural and asked him to relay a request for a meeting to Theron. Her son arrived at her apartment that night by disabling the perimeter sensors and climbing up the wall of the building, though Shan was aware of his presence and left the balcony doors open. Despite Theron's initial hostility, Shan expressed her pride in her son's accomplishments, and she attempted to warn Theron about Malcom's desire to destroy the Empire, but Theron grew angry with her and departed. Upon her son's departure, Shan allowed herself to experience the painful memories of her split with Malcom, and she reminded herself of her choice to give up a chance at a family in service of the Republic.<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\n[[File:Teff'ith.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The Twi'lek Teff'ith]]\nA few days later, the [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|Coruscant Security Force]] called Shan to [[Diplomatic Spaceport 27-B]], where a young Twi'lek female was holding a [[Unidentified Coruscant Security customs guard 1|CSF officer]] hostage after the [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police]] had attempted to arrest her upon arrival&mdash;for she had landed in the [[Prosperity (shuttle)|''Prosperity'']], the [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] that Theron and Gnost-Dural had taken on their [[Mission to Reaver Station|most recent mission]]. The young woman had forced the CSF [[Officer/Legends|officers]] to contact the Grand Master, and Shan immediately knew that she was telling the truth when the Twi'lek informed her that Theron had sent her to deliver a message. At Shan's apartment, the Twi'lek [[Teff'ith]] explained Theron's message: Malcom planned to sacrifice the planet [[Duro/Legends|Duro]] to the Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Nezzor]] to prevent the Empire from realizing that the Republic had one of its [[black cipher]] encryption devices, and Theron and Gnost-Dural intended to prevent this by boarding the ''Ascendant Spear'', which the two would ensure went to Duro. As a result, Theron needed his mother to convince his father to send the Republic fleet to Duro&mdash;and Malcom was furious to learn that Theron had told Shan about his plans when she called him in the middle of the night and arrive at his apartment.<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\nRemaining calm throughout their entire conversation as the man she loved grew even angrier with her, Shan worked to convince Malcom to listen to their son, and her statement that Malcom had forgotten the difference between the Empire and the Republic cut deep. Shan acknowledged that Malcom was still a good man despite his hate and anger, and she revealed that her choice to hide Theron from his father might have been the wrong one. Teff'ith's interruption brought the pair back to the matter of Duro, and Satele's request that Malcom have faith in their son was the final argument that convinced the Supreme Commander to accept Theron's plan. Shan then shot down Malcom's objections and insisted that she was coming to Duro with him, and the two boarded Malcom's flagship, ''[[Aegis]]'', within an [[Standard hour/Legends|hour]] along with Teff'ith. Nine hours later, Shan was on the bridge with Malcom and Teff'ith when Moff Nezzor's fleet arrived, and she watched as Malcom and his subordinate Admiral [[Gorwin]] [[Battle of Duro (Galactic War)|pounded]] the ''[[Extempus]]'' and the rest of the Imperial fleet. Just as Malcom's ships finished destroying the ''Extempus'' and preventing its suicide run on one of Duro's orbital cities, Shan sensed the impending arrival of Darth Karrid and alerted the bridge mere [[Standard second|seconds]] before the ''Ascendant Spear'' dropped out of hyperspace on the edge of the [[Duro system]].<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\nThe ''Ascendant Spear''{{'s}} initial attempts to attack the ''Aegis'' were hindered by Theron's [[Slicer/Legends|slicing]] efforts aboard the Imperial warship, but the Republic fleet scored relatively few hits on the vessel before Karrid assumed control again and took out 30 percent of the ''Aegis''{{'s}} [[Deflector shield/Legends|shields]] in a single hit. As the battle continued, Shan watched as Malcom withdrew his fleet to a position where it could not inflict lasting damage on the ''Ascendant Spear'' but one that also prevented Karrid from completely destroying the Republic fleet in a single attack. Karrid's Force-enhanced mental control over the ''Ascendant Spear'' was lessened when Gnost-Dural engaged her apprentices in a duel and deprived her of their strength in the Force, but as the ''Ascendant Spear'' drew close enough for its long-range weaponry to attack the ''Aegis'', Shan and the rest of the bridge were plunged into darkness when Malcom ordered the vessel to divert all power to the shields from everything except the sensors and [[Life support/Legends|life support]]. As Karrid's attack pounded away at the shields, Shan and Malcom held hands as they prepared for the ''Aegis''{{'s}} destruction.<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\n[[File:Annihilation_Duro.png|thumb|left|245px|Shan witnessed the battle at Duro while aboard the ''Aegis''.]]\nHowever, the Republic fleet was spared the ''Ascendant Spear''{{'s}} wrath when Theron succeeded in separating Karrid from its controls, leaving the vessel dead in space as its commander, Moff [[Gelmid Lorman]], struggled to decide whether to assume control or wait for Karrid to take back the ship. The bridge crew of the ''Aegis'' waited in silence for Karrid's attack, but Malcom soon realized that the ''Ascendant Spear'' was vulnerable and ordered the entire fleet to attack. As the fleet pounded away at the defenseless warship, Theron succeeded in killing Karrid, and he and Gnost-Dural fled to the escape pods when Karrid's apprentices withdrew to save themselves. Shan and Malcom watched as the ''Ascendant Spear'' was consumed by a [[Hypermatter/Legends|hypermatter]] explosion, but the entire bridge realized that the ship's destruction might have also killed both Theron and Gnost-Dural. Fortunately for Shan and Malcom, the missing duo hailed the ''Aegis'' from one of the escape pods and were quickly brought aboard the vessel. Both parents were overjoyed to see their son alive, though they contained their emotions in front of the ''Aegis''{{'s}} crew and confined themselves to congratulatory remarks.<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\nThree days later, Shan attended a debriefing in Malcom's office with Gnost-Dural and [[Director of Republic Strategic Information Service|SIS director]] [[Marcus Trant]], with neither Shan nor Malcom having spoken to their son or one another other than an earlier ceremony in which Theron, Gnost-Dural, and Teff'ith were awarded the Cross of Glory. Both Shan and Malcom were disappointed that Theron failed to show up to the debriefing, but Shan remained behind afterward to speak with Malcom, reassuring him that their son would seek them out when he was ready. Shan then departed after holding Malcom's shoulder for a moment to convey her sadness for what was lost.<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\nAround [[3638 BBY]], Shan established a [[Holocomm/Legends|holocommunication]] to the space station [[Keylander Station]], serving as an advisor to [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Leontyne Saresh]] and a Republic hero, in their plans to handle the [[Conquest of Makeb|situation]] on [[Makeb]]&mdash;which the [[Hutt Cartel]] had invaded weeks prior.<ref name=\"Trouble in Paradise\">{{TORcite|exp=rothc|type=faction|[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]|Trouble in Paradise|[[Keylander Station]]}}</ref>\n\n====Revan returned====\n{{Dialogue|Theron Shan|The fourth moon of Yavin.

The two fleets had been lured there by the [[Order of Revan]], whose [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] allies, the [[Nova Blades]], had manipulated Republic and Imperial patrol routes in order to force a confrontation between the two. The battle was complicated by the presence of Revanite ships that attacked both sides and Revanite [[Saboteur/Legends|saboteurs]] aboard both fleets, and a signal [[jammer]] on Rishi prevented communication among the combatants. However, an independent group of Republic and Imperial agents brought down the jammer and contacted Shan and the Imperial commander, [[Darth Marr]], warning them of the Revanites' involvement.<ref name=\"Battle of Rishi\">{{TORcite|exp=shadow|type=flashpoint|Battle of Rishi}}</ref> The two sides agreed to a ceasefire and met in the town of [[Raider's Cove]] on Rishi, where Shan found her son, Theron, to be one of the allied operatives who had exposed the Revanites' plot. Theron's group revealed to Shan and Marr that Revan himself was alive and leading the Revanites and that he sought to bring the Sith Emperor back to a physical form on the moon of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] in order to permanently kill the Emperor. Faced with the threat of the power-mad Emperor returned to his full strength, Shan and Marr agreed to a temporary truce between their two fleets and set off for the [[Yavin system/Legends|Yavin system]].<ref name=\"Frontal Assault\">{{TORcite|exp=shadow|type=general|Frontal Assault|Rishi}}</ref>\n\nShan and Marr established a command post for their coalition on Yavin's surface and coordinated their forces with Theron and his allies, the Sith [[Lana Beniko]] and the Wookiee smuggler [[Jakarro]]. However, they soon found that their forces, while not in open conflict, were unable to trust one another, and so decided to establish a neutral sensor perimeter past the intermingled forces holding a perimeter around the command post. While on Yavin, both Shan and Marr confirmed the Emperor's presence but also sensed a faint and unique light side presence hidden among the residual energies of past Sith, though they were unable to pinpoint the location.<ref name=\"Confederacy\">{{TORcite|exp=shadow|type=general|Confederacy|Yavin 4}}</ref> The coalitions' sensors soon identified a series of ransacked structures that were mixtures of ancient and modern materials, and Marr was able to determine that the structures were the long-rumored [[Imperial Guard Academy]]. Coalition forces investigated and brought back the insane [[Commandant/Legends|Commandant]] [[Iven]], whose interrogation revealed Revan's plans&mdash;the nearby [[Temple of Sacrifice]] held a powerful [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] that could consume all life on Yavin 4, fueling the Emperor's restoration.<ref name=\"The Devoted Ones\" /> However, the coalition forces also encountered the spirit of the real Revan, who was unable to identify the person wearing his [[Revan's mask|mask]] and leading the Revanites.<ref name=\"Fates Unsealed\">{{TORcite|exp=shadow|type=general|Fates Unsealed|Yavin 4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Satele_Shan_1.png|thumb|left|240px|Satele Shan faces Revan.]]\nUnder Shan and Marr's command, the coalition forces stormed the Temple, overwhelming the Revanites. Along with Theron, Marr, and a number of other Republic and Imperial heroes, Shan confronted her ancestor in the Temple before he began the ritual to restore the Emperor&mdash;but when they accused him of being an impostor, \"Revan\" removed his mask to reveal that he was, in fact, the legendary Force-user. In the battle that followed, the Grand Master held herself back to make use of [[battle meditation]], sharing strength with her allies in the fight against Revan, and her power-mad ancestor was ultimately defeated. To the surprise of everyone present, a booming laugh rang out, and a blast of dark side energy rushed into the sky from the Temple: The Emperor, revealing that the battle on the moon had restored his strength, declared his intentions to retake the galaxy and vanished without taking a physical form.<ref name=\"The Enemy Within\">{{TORcite|exp=shadow|type=faction|Republic|The Enemy Within|Yavin 4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Satele_Shan_2.png|thumb|right|240px|Satele Shan with her son on Yavin 4]]\nRevan's spirit arrived in the aftermath of the battle, and the coalition learned the truth: Revan had [[Battle of the Foundry|died]] at the [[Foundry (space station)|Foundry]], but the mental torture that he had undergone at the Emperor's hands had caused Revan to split into two rather than die. Part of him joined with the Force, but his darker half had refused to die. The spirit Revan reabsorbed the dark Revan, causing Revan's body to vanish as he became one with the Force. With Revan's defeat, the coalition dissolved, though a truce remained in effect while the Republic and the Empire withdrew their forces. Before leaving the moon, Shan and her son spoke with a number of Republic heroes who had fought alongside the coalition against Revan, including the Hero of Tython and the Barsen'thor. After conferring with the Council, Shan appointed the Hero as the Order's newest Battlemaster and tasked the Barsen'thor with investigating the sources of the Emperor's power and his plans. Shan also spoke with the [[Meteor (Havoc Squad)|commander]] of the elite [[Havoc Squad]]; a new joint task force was being formed by the Jedi, the SIS, and the military with the intent of hunting down the Emperor, and Jace Malcom recommended the commander be made the task force's primary military [[Advisor/Legends|advisor]].

In doing so, they released a [[Sith alchemy/Legends|Sith ritual]] that unleashed an [[Tenebrae's curse|ancient plague]], leaving Scourge and Carsen comatose, but not infected due to their bond to the former emperor acting as a vaccine. More than a year later, Shan found and rescued them, unknowingly becoming infected by Tenebrae's plague. Within days, Shan and her [[Satele Shan's followers|followers]] were left in a nightmarish sleep, in which they slowly began merging into a hive mind.

Departing for the vessel, the three made their way through the interior, encountering the [[Hand of the Empire|Emperor's Hand]] and the [[Scions of Zakuul]] along the way as they were guided by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]. Eventually they made their way to the unconscious bodies of Shan and her followers, and entered her [[Mindscape|mind]] to assist Shan in thwarting the attempted resurrection of Tenebrae. The Commander fought their way to Shan, who awoke to reveal that her unconscious state had been a trap for Tenebrae. Shan, alongside the Commander, Carsen, Scourge, [[Darth Marr]], Revan, [[Meetra Surik]], and all those that Tenebrae had murdered and manipulated over the centuries, assisted in Tenebrae's final defeat. With his death, the spirits of Marr, Revan, and Surik were able to become [[Netherworld of the Force/Legends|one]] with the Force. Following this, Shan spoke privately with the Commander, thanking them for being a good friend to her son [[Theron Shan]].

Shan recognized that she would do everything in her power to protect her son, and, coupled with the powers and responsibilities she possessed as a Jedi and a Republic hero, she believed the risk was too great and therefore gave Theron to Ngani Zho.

However, ''Annihilation'' contradicts the ''Encyclopedia'' and the game itself by stating that Shan was a Jedi Master in 3666 BBY, when, in fact, she was granted the title of Master following her rediscovery of Tython.<ref name=\"Annihilation\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Return (cinematic trailer)|''Return'']]\n*[[Hope (cinematic trailer)|''Hope'']]\n*{{InsiderCite|124|The Old Republic: The Third Lesson}} {{Mo}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/blog/20150707|text=Vacation|int=Vacation}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Old Republic: Deceived]]''\n*[[The Old Republic: Deceived (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Deceived'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Old Republic, Threat of Peace Act 1: Treaty of Coruscant]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Old Republic, Threat of Peace Act 2: New Galactic Order]]''\n*''[[The Old Republic, Threat of Peace Act 3: Uncertain Surrender]]''\n*''[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance]]''\n*[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''\n*[[Cartel Market|''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' Cartel Market]]\n*''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 1]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 2]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 4]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[The Old Republic\u2014The Lost Suns 5]]''\n*''[[The Old Republic: Annihilation]]''\n*[[The Old Republic: Annihilation (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Annihilation'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Strongholds]]'' {{C|Statue}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan]]''\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/blog/20150403|text=Regrets|int=Regrets}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught]]''\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/article/20210413|text=\"Quite A Story To Tell\" Short Story|int=Quite A Story To Tell}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Satele Shan}}\n*{{InsiderCite|110|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}} {{Po}} <!-- pg. 58 -->\n*{{Holonet|old=true|biographies|jedi-grand-master-satele-shan|Grand Master Satele Shan}}\n*{{InsiderCite|120|Bantha Tracks}} {{Po}}\n*{{InsiderCite|124|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*{{TORweb|url=community/showthread.php?p=5637093#edit5637093|text=Alexander Freed's post on SWTOR.com, confirming Satele's appearance in ''Hope''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|126|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/media/trailers/signs-war|text=Signs of War Trailer}}\n*''[[The Art and Making of Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''\n*[[The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural (real-life book)|''The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural'']]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[LEGO Star Wars Expanded Universe]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|137|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*{{LEGOCite|eu|9497|Republic Striker Starfighter}}\n*''[[The Bounty Hunter Code: From the Files of Boba Fett]]''\n*{{TORweb|url=shadow-of-revan|text=Shadow of Revan}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20141124|text=New \"Revan Returns\" Trailer}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/blog/20141202|text=Welcome to Shadow of Revan Early Access!}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/article/20141209|text=New Shadow of Revan Launch Trailer}}\n*''[[Nexus of Power]]''\n*<!--2017-->{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20170509|text=May the 4th Hits the Cartel Market: Final Week}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20170808|text=Cartel Market Specials: Week of August 8, 2017}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20171023|text=Celebrating the legacy of Star Wars\u2122: Knights of the Old Republic\u2122}} {{Po}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20171024|text=The Impact of KOTOR on SWTOR}} {{Po}}\n*<!--2018-->{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20180206|text=#SWTOR Cartel Market Specials: Week of February 5, 2018}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20181130|text=Jedi Under Siege: State of the Galaxy}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20181211|text=Celebrating #SWTOR7}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20181211-1|text=#SWTOR Cartel Market Newest Additions: Week of December 11}}\n*<!--2019-->{{TORweb|url=info/news/news-article/20190207|text=A Look Behind the Scenes with Ossus}}\n*<!--2020-->{{TORweb|url=info/news/article/20200721|text=SWTOR is on Steam!}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/article/20201112|text=Now on PTS: The Spirit of Vengeance Flashpoint, Login Rewards, and Emote Window!}}\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/article/20201209|text=Game Update 6.2 'Echoes of Vengeance' is Live!}}\n}}\n\n----\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]<ref name=\"Holonet\" />\n|years=Pre&ndash;[[3645 BBY]]<ref name=\"Gnost\" />&mdash;c.
