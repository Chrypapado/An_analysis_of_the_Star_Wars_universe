He hired [[Tusken Raider]]s to murder members of the local police. This began a long blood feud between colonists and sand people. During his 34-[[Standard year|year]]-long occupation of the monastery, Alkhara cut a road from the citadel to the [[Western Dune Sea]] and [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], and also added battlements, dungeons, and a [[Alkhara Tower|nine-story tower]] to the building. Eventually, the bandit was driven off Tatooine by the [[Hutt]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], who turned the monastery-cum-hideout into his personal palace.<ref name=\"CL\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']] {{1stm}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|36|Highlights of the Saga|Attack on Jabba's Palace}}\n*{{TOMCite|101|Database|Before the dark times&hellip;}}\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Tatooine (Star Wars Encyclopedia)|Tatooine}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Alkhara#kanon\n|ja=\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\n|nl=Alkhara\n|deGA=1\n|ru=\u0410\u043b\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
