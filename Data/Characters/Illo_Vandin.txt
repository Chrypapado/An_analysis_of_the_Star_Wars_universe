Stranded on Ord Mantell, Vandin made a name for himself on the gambling circuit and became incredibly wealthy. Financially backing up-and-coming gamblers on occasion, Vandin was fond of taking young professionals under his tutelage and serving as their manager. In addition, Vandin operated many smaller casinos in [[Worlport/Legends|Worlport]] and abroad, bringing in additional revenue to his already sizable estate. Secretly, Vandin had dealings that circumvented the law. He established and ran operations in [[racketeering]], [[loan shark]]ing, and [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] which cemented his position in the elite class of the planet. Residing in the [[Jewel District]] of Worlport, Vandin owned a [[Illo Vandin's villa|modestly-sized villa]] with interior walls that were floor-to-ceiling [[Aquarium/Legends|aquariums]] holding exotic marine life. The estate was patrolled by guardsmen to act as [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]] and protect his wealth. Despite this, Vandin still carried a [[Heavy blaster pistol/Legends|heavy blaster pistol]] on his person.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mask of the Pirate Queen]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vandin, Illo}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Herglics]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mantellians]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
