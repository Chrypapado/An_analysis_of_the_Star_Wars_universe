While the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Trauger]] was on Socorro pursuing a bounty, Trauger threatened to kill Oceke's mother if a member of Oceke's tribe would not lead him to his bounty. Oceke decided to aid Trauger if the bounty hunter would let Oceke's mother go, but instead of leading him to his bounty, Oceke led Trauger into a field of gas, which killed Trauger immediately. That incident gave [[Trauger gas]] its name.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Black Sands of Socorro|story=Of a Man Called Trauger|stext=''Of a Man Called Trauger''}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Black Sands of Socorro]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Socorrans]]"}}}]}}}}
