Assigned as an [[Padawan/Legends|apprentice]] to Jedi Master [[Kyle Katarn]], Korr [[Disciples of Ragnos crisis|participated in the fight]] against a newly emerged [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]] called the [[Disciples of Ragnos]], which sought to resurrect an ancient [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]], [[Marka Ragnos]]. Korr undertook multiple missions throughout the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]], foiling the cult's plans as best as he could and [[Mission to Vjun (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)|earning]] himself a promotion to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. Eventually, Korr [[Battle of Korriban (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)|defeated]] the leader of the cult, [[Tavion Axmis]], on the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Korriban]], stopping the Disciples of Ragnos.\n\nIn [[40 ABY]], during the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], Korr participated in an [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Second Galactic Civil War)|attack]] on the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] known as [[Centerpoint Station]], during which he [[Death/Legends|killed]] over two dozen people aboard Centerpoint by [[spacing]] them, an act he later came to regret deeply. Having struggled throughout his whole life with the feeling of doubt and afraid of his natural affinity for dark side [[Force power/Legends|powers]], Korr became disillusioned with the Jedi Order and his own role with the Force. He distanced himself from the Jedi and lived in a self-imposed [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]] on Coruscant until he received a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] from the Force that [[Mission to the frozen moon|directed]] him to a [[frozen moon]] in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Korr then [[Brawl in the Black Hole|enlisted]] the crew of the [[Scavenger/Legends|salvage]] [[Starship/Legends|ship]] [[Junker (YT-2400 light freighter)|''Junker'']], the Human [[Khedryn Faal]] and the [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] [[Marr Idi-Shael]], to [[Pilot/Legends|fly]] him to the moon from his vision. Arriving there, Korr and his companions received a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress signal]] coming from the surface of the moon and also encountered the ancient [[Sith dreadnaught]] [[Harbinger (Sith dreadnaught)|''Harbinger'']], as well as Jedi Master [[Relin Druur]]. Both Druur and the crew of the Sith vessel had unknowingly [[Time travel/Legends|traveled]] [[5000 BBY/Legends|five thousand years]] through [[Time/Legends|time]] from the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]].\n\nWhile Druur went on his separate path and [[Mission to the Harbinger|destroyed]] the ''Harbinger'' carrying the cargo of powerful [[Lignan crystal]]s, Korr followed his vision and landed on the frozen moon, where he found an abandoned [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Imperial research facility|research facility]], in which the Empire's [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]] had been conducting experiments on creating [[Cloning/Legends|clones]] from combined Jedi and Sith [[DNA/Legends|DNA]] which was authorized by [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]]. However, the clones had [[Clone madness|gone mad]] and had [[Carnage on the frozen moon|killed]] their creators. As the [[Community|surviving clones]] escaped from the moon, Korr and the crew of ''Junker'' pursued them, with Korr taking on the Force-sensitive Idi-Shael as his apprentice. His experiences on the frozen moon also taught Korr to accept the feeling of doubt as an integral part of himself. Following the clones' trail, Korr also discovered that one of the clones, [[Soldier (clone)|Soldier]], had been produced from his DNA.\n\nEventually, Korr and the two scavengers [[Mission to Mother|tracked]] the clones to an ancient [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]], which had developed its own consciousness and which the clones venerated as \"[[Mother (Rakatan entity)|Mother]].\" Aboard the station, Korr and Idi-Shael were ambushed by the [[Umbaran/Legends|Umbaran]] [[Nyss Nenn]], an agent of the [[One Sith]] organization. Korr killed the Umbaran but was in turn killed by [[the Iteration]], another clone of his created by the One Sith and intended to replace Korr in the Jedi Order as their agent. Thanks to Idi-Shael's quick thinking, however, Korr's consciousness was preserved in the [[Iteration]]'s body; Korr's apprentice used the [[mindspear]] device to transfer Korr's memories into the clone, after which Korr and his Padawan escaped from Mother. Korr remained unaware of the transfer that had occurred, and he returned to the Jedi Order, continuing his respectable career.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|You all right?''\"<br />\"''Yeah, fine.

Thrawn's discovery of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|storage]] of Spaarti cloning cylinders is depicted in the novel ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'', and his [[Death/Legends|death]] is featured in ''[[The Last Command]]''. The creation of the clones must therefore have occurred in the [[Time/Legends|time]] period between the two novels, which are set in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], according to ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''.</ref> Korr was inadvertently involved in Imperial [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] experiments with [[Cloning/Legends|cloning]].

Soldier was the latest of the clones produced and was the most stable of the clones, not suffering from the [[sickness]] that affected the other clones and caused their bodies to deteriorate if not administered the [[metacycline]] drug. Korr was unaware of his clone's creation; Soldier was none the wiser as to the identity of his [[Prime clone|genetic template]], as the clone lived in isolation at the facility, a subject of constant scientific experiments.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n===Arrival at the Jedi Academy===\n{{Quote|So, where did you get that lightsaber?''\"<br />\"''Well, it's kind of a long story; I found myself on&hellip;|Rosh Penin and Jaden Korr just moments before their shuttle was attacked|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy}}\nIn [[14 ABY/Legends|14 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date1\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' places the events of ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'' in [[14 ABY/Legends|14 ABY]].

In a [[Dream/Legends|dreamlike]] state, he used whatever spare parts he could find inside the workshop to construct a working [[Color/Legends|purple]]-bladed [[Jaden Korr's first lightsaber|lightsaber]], a rare feat for an untrained Force-sensitive. Marveled by the blade he had created, Korr showed the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to Orn.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nConcerned by Korr now possessing such a dangerous weapon, Orn reported his nephew to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] authorities on Coruscant, and within two [[Standard day/Legends|days]] Korr was enrolled into [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[Jedi Praxeum]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] to be [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] as a Jedi. After a series of [[Realspace/Legends|space]] flights and multiple changes of [[Transport/Legends|transports]],<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> Korr ended up on the shuttle ''[[Yavin Runner II]]'', bound for the Jedi Praxeum.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Jaden_Rosh_meeting.png|thumb|left|250px|Korr met Rosh Penin aboard the ''Yavin Runner II'' .]]\nDuring the ride, he met a fellow [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|recruit]], [[Rosh Penin]], who was intrigued by Korr's lightsaber and inquired Korr about its origins. Before Korr could answer, their shuttle was [[Yavin 4 Incursion|shot down]] by hostile forces as it approached the surface of Yavin 4, although the [[Unidentified Yavin Runner II pilot|shuttle pilot]] managed to crash-land the transport without any casualties.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nHowever, Korr and Penin were separated from the rest of the group during the crash and could not join the other [[Padawan/Legends|students]], who were escorted to a [[Unidentified Massassi temple|nearby Massassi temple]] by the [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]]. Skywalker was planning to pick the students up with a shuttle and deliver them to the main Academy site, the [[Great Temple/Legends|Great Temple]]. Korr and Penin, meanwhile, proceeded to the nearby temple on their own, but they ran into a group of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] and a [[darksider]] wielding a red lightsaber. After Korr defeated the enemies, he crossed a [[Water/Legends|moat]] surrounding the temple and climbed up one of its alcoves. From that hiding spot, he saw three figures standing at the entrance to the temple, a female and two males. The female was pointing a glowing [[Scepter of Ragnos|scepter]] at the building, linking the two by a beam of pulsing energy.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nHowever, Korr's eavesdropping efforts were detected, and the mysterious figures turned on him, emanating a bright flash of light from the [[Scepter/Legends|scepter]] that knocked Korr unconscious. Upon awakening, Korr witnessed that the three figures were gone. He was reunited with Penin and the other students, who had arrived on site. Korr then met Jedi Masters [[Kyle Katarn]] and Skywalker, who had arrived to retrieve the Jedi initiates. The Jedi Masters welcomed their new students to the Jedi Academy and questioned Korr about what he had seen. The [[Disciples of Ragnos crisis|incursion]] by the unknown forces, which bore striking semblance to a [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]], worried the Masters, as did the fact that the [[Force sense/Legends|aura]] around the temple had become much weaker after the attack.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n===First training exercise===\n{{Dialogue|Penin|Hey, it was just a joke!

During the ceremony, Skywalker assigned the new recruits to their Masters. Both Korr and Penin were assigned to Katarn as students, and they were taken to a nearby [[Yavin training grounds|Jedi training course]] to be instructed in basic [[Force power/Legends|Force abilities]] such as [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]], [[Force speed]] and Force sense. Overseen by Katarn, Korr and Penin took separate routes to the finish line of the course. On the way, however, Penin set loose a [[ASP-19 battle droid/Legends|lightsaber practice droid]] upon Korr in the hope of slowing him down so he could finish the exercise first, but Korr defeated the [[Droid/Legends|machine]].<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Korr_Katarn_Penin.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Jaden Korr, Rosh Penin and their master, Kyle Katarn]]\nAfter they completed the course, Korr became angered at Penin for his actions, but Katarn warned Korr that anger could lead to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and Korr accepted Penin's apology, cementing the friendship that had started to develop between them.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nSkywalker then informed the three that he had analyzed a piece of clothing worn by one of the [[Sith Cultist]]s whom Korr had encountered, discovering that it bore the symbol of [[Marka Ragnos]], an ancient [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] of the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]] who had died more than [[5000 BBY/Legends|five thousand years]] earlier. The Jedi Master told Korr and Penin that they would be assigned on different missions throughout the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] and instructed them to look for more information regarding the cult during those missions.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n===Disciples of Ragnos crisis===\n====Teaming up with Chewbacca====\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy}}\n{{Quote|A Jedi, me?

Korr soon heard [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] fire and lit his lightsaber to face the attackers, but instead it was the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], the co-pilot of the ''Falcon'', who ran through the door, escaping from a group of mercenaries. The famous Wookiee, who was on the planet for a mission in connection with [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Leia Organa Solo]], helped Korr to get rid of the members of the Tatooine underworld that [[Lightfight|assailed]] them both, and together they eliminated many of the thugs.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nIn an attempt to stop Korr and Chewbacca's advance, the mercenaries then activated [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beams]] that prevented the ''Raven's Claw'' and the ''Falcon'' from taking off. Korr and Chewbacca split up, and while the Wookiee distracted the mercenaries, the young Jedi handled the deactivation of the tractor beams. Upon reaching the tractor beam control room, however, he was confronted by a lightsaber-wielding enemy, a member of the same Sith cult that Korr had previously engaged on Yavin. Korr defeated the opponent and deactivated the tractor beams.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nKorr and Chewbacca reunited and then eliminated the last mercenaries, who had prepared an ambush around the ''Falcon''. It was at that moment that Katarn came back to the hangar, sharing the intelligence he had gathered from his contacts with Korr and the Wookiee. Katarn had learned that the mercenaries were known to take a high price for their services, a fact that led Katarn to suspect the [[Imperial Remnant]] in financing the cult. Before the Jedi left, Chewbacca showed his affection for Korr, and Master Katarn instructed the Wookiee to inform Organa Solo of his discoveries.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====The deserts of Tatooine====\n{{Quote|This should be a total blue milk run, kid.

Having taken flight, the [[Moisture farmer/Legends|farmer]] had sold his droid to the [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Scavenger/Legends|scavengers]] and had left the planet. Traversing the deserts of Tatooine, the apprentice and his Master [[Mission to Tatooine (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)|attempted]] to retrieve the [[R5-series astromech droid|R5 unit]] before the Jawas could [[Memory wipe/Legends|erase]] its memory and sell it.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nKatarn instructed his apprentice to attempt to locate the Jawas [[Sandcrawler/Legends|sandcrawler]] in a nearby canyon, while he was collecting information from local [[Farm/Legends|farmers]]. On his way to the sandcrawler, however, Korr bore witness to a [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] attack on the Jawas. Korr was forced to eliminate the Tusken warriors and [[Sniper/Legends|snipers]] located in the canyon before reaching a [[Unidentified abandoned Tatooine settlement|deserted settlement]], inhabited only by a few droids and marauding Tuskens.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Droid_rescued.png|thumb|right|250px|Korr reunites with his Master after retrieving the droid.]]\nAfter passing through a tunnel network infested with Tuskens, Korr eventually reached the Jawas' sandcrawler, which had been taken over by the Sand People. Korr managed to penetrate the vessel's hold in search of the droid and defeated the infesting Sand People. As most of the Jawas had been killed in the Sand People attack, Korr believed that there was no one left to negotiate the trade with, so he extracted the droid from the sandcrawler. After dealing with a final Sand People attack outside, Korr reunited with his Master. The droid was delivered to the Academy, where Skywalker's own [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] scoured the unit's [[Memory core|memory banks]] for useful information.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====Incursion on Bakura====\n{{Quote|Where are you, Kyle?

After a Bakuran team sent to investigate on the intrusion did not return, Skywalker assigned Korr on a [[Mission to Bakura (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)|follow-up mission]], asking him to wait for Katarn's arrival before dislodging the unknown forces from the [[power plant]]. The Jedi were instructed to ensure that the station&mdash;built on the crater of a dormant [[Volcano/Legends|volcano]]&mdash;remained intact, because the awakening of the volcano could destroy a crowded city.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Waiting_on_bakura.png|thumb|left|250px|Korr waiting for Katarn on Bakura]]\nArriving on Bakura in his [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]], the [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]]<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> ''[[Far Wanderer]]'',<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> Korr waited for Katarn for an extended period of [[Time/Legends|time]] on the landing pad. After a while, Korr lost his patience and decided to explore the vicinity of the plant alone. Following a trail of corpses of the Bakuran rescue team, he infiltrated the facility and checked the security system of the plant.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nKorr discovered that the infiltrators, forces of the Imperial Remnant, had placed five [[Bomb/Legends|bombs]] at crucial points throughout the facility.

As he was leaving Bakura, Korr received a message from Katarn, who apologized for being unable to come.

The Jedi Master stated that the person who had sliced into his records had stolen [[Luke Skywalker's journal|his journal]] containing the names of places where he had found a very [[Force nexus|strong connection]] to the Force. The [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] temple on which the cultists had used the scepter had also lost its dark side aura, which had been absorbed by the artifact. Worried of what the enemy was planning, Skywalker sent the Jedi to various places mentioned in his journal.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n====Arrival on Hoth====\n{{Quote|Hmmm.

Investigating further, he soon found a number of flashing [[relay beacon]]s.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nFollowing their trail, he found that Imperials were patrolling the area. Encountering some local [[Tauntaun/Legends|tauntaun]] creatures, Korr climbed on the back of one of the creatures and cut his way through Imperial patrols to a [[Cave/Legends|cave]], where he encountered a [[Wampa/Legends|wampa]] beast. After defeating the wampa, Korr proceeded to follow the flashing beacons placed by the Imperials, and reached an outpost abandoned by the Rebel Alliance during the evacuation from Hoth.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nBefore penetrating into the base, the young apprentice had to fight his way through the [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|All Terrain Scout Transports]], [[Viper probe droid/Legends|Viper probe droids]] and Imperial [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] guarding it, and then he had to eliminate the Imperial [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] who were patrolling the inside of the outpost. Upon arriving at the exit, Korr was assaulted by a squad of [[Cold assault stormtrooper|snowtroopers]] that he killed with an abandoned [[E-Web heavy repeating blaster]].<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nHe then eliminated the stormtroopers stationed around the wreckage of the Battle of Hoth before reaching [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]], whose entrance was blocked. Locating the entrance to series of tunnels dug from underneath the remains of an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|All Terrain Armored Transport]] and which the Imperials used to get into the structure, he entered the former base of the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====Battle with Alora====\n{{Quote|Ah, you must be the saber-wielding troublemaker who neutralized our perimeter guard.

The Jedi navigated corridors infested with [[Troop/Legends|troopers]], until he got to the old [[Computer/Legends|computer]] room used by the Rebels. Unnoticed, the Jedi apprentice overheard a [[Unidentified Sith cultist|Sith cultist]] talking on a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] to another Dark Jedi named [[Alora (Dark Jedi)|Alora]] about the fact that Skywalker had traveled to the planet [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]] after the Battle of Hoth.

Alora noticed the Jedi and briefly spoke to him, revealing the cult's name as the [[Disciples of Ragnos]]. The two engaged in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]], and though initially evenly matched, Korr soon began to gain the upper hand. Realizing her imminent defeat, Alora escaped through a caved-in section of Echo Base, taunting Korr as she fled.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nBack on Yavin 4, Korr made his report to Skywalker and Katarn, who informed Korr that the Force had not only been taken on Hoth but everywhere Jedi had been sent.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> The accounts of the mission on Hoth were later documented in Korr and Katarn's [[Datacard/Legends|datacard]] report entitled [[Tauntaun Feathers A1]], which was later donated by Skywalker to the [[New Republic Historical Archive]].<ref name=\"Under the Ice\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031218hoth4|text=Hoth: Under the Ice, Part 4: A Brief Thaw|int=Hoth: Under the Ice, Part 4: A Brief Thaw|archivedate=20090603070610}}</ref>\n\n====Hostage rescue====\n{{Quote|Nice work, Jaden!

Korr, worried for his friend, volunteered to help, but Skywalker instead instructed him to continue with his training, going on various missions across the galaxy. Now a formal Apprentice of the New Jedi Order, Korr also learned a new style of [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]]&mdash;either [[Fast style|fast]] or [[Strong style|strong]]&mdash;in addition to his [[medium style]]. With both Katarn and Skywalker away from the Academy, Korr was given directions by a [[Jedi Praxeum protocol droid]].<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Korr_meeting_elders.png|thumb|right|250px|Korr frees the Mining Guild elders.]]\nThe first assignment<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> took Korr to the planet [[Nar Kreeta]].<ref name=\"CSWE Nar Kreeta\">{{CSWECite|II|361|Nar Kreeta}}</ref> There, a group of [[Mining Guild elders|elders]] from the local [[Mining Guild/Legends|Mining Guild]] had tried to negotiate with a [[Unidentified Hutt crime lord (Nar Kreeta)|local Hutt crime lord]]. The elders were instead captured by the Hutt, who claimed that they never visited him in the first place. Katarn, who was nearby on his search for Penin, was available to assist Korr on the [[Mission to Nar Kreeta|mission]]. Flying him to the [[Nar Kreeta Hutt palace|Hutt's palace]] on the ''Raven's Claw'', Katarn dropped off Korr at the entrance to a ventilation system and remained there to pick up the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]].<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nCovertly making his way into the palace, Korr overheard from the Hutt's guards and learned that the Hutt was using his [[Prison/Legends|prisoners]] in a deadly [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] event, where he pitted them against a [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] creature. Korr located and freed the elders, escorting them back to the ''Raven's Claw''. However, the elders informed the Jedi about three more holding cells containing more prisoners being held by the Hutt.

They acted too slow, however, and a sniper shot killed Korr's contact before the man could share any important intelligence with the Jedi. Korr made his way through the outpost alone, where he found another [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] parked at the other side. Using the vehicle, he made his way back to safety and left the planet, his mission a failure.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====Raid on Kril'Dor====\n{{Quote|Thanks for the assistance, Jaden. Luke tells me you're going to be a great Jedi.|Wedge Antilles, to Jaden Korr|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy}}\nNo sooner had Korr finished with his previous assignment than he was recruited on another mission on behalf of the New Republic. [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] had discovered an Imperial [[Tibanna/Legends|tibanna]] gas [[Kril'Dor tibanna mining facility|mining facility]] on the planet [[Kril'Dor/Legends|Kril'Dor]], which was being used to supply the Disciples. A daring [[Mission to Kril'Dor|raid]] was planned by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], with Korr playing a crucial role, having been recommended for the mission by Skywalker. Korr and Antilles arrived at the facility, with the Jedi landing his Z-95, while Antilles remained in air aboard his [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|T-65 X-wing starfighter]].<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Krildor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Kril'Dor facility]]\nActing on Antilles' instructions, Korr placed [[targeting beacon]]s at crucial areas of the installation, which included the [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|deflector shield generator]], the hangar, the [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]], the [[Communications array/Legends|communications array]], the generator powering the [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolasers]], and the command center. Throughout the mission, Korr fought a large number of Imperials, including [[Imperial jumptrooper]]s and several Sith Cultists.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nHoping to deny the New Republic their victory, the remaining Imperial forces attempted to destroy the tibanna gas platforms, but Korr successfully disarmed their demolition charges before escaping from the facility, allowing the New Republic to secure the platform and cut the supplies to the Disciples. In the meantime, Skywalker and Katarn continued with their respective missions. Skywalker found out that the cult had been able to siphon the energy from the [[Dark Side Cave]] on Dagobah, and Katarn learned that Penin had been captured by the Disciples during his mission on Byss.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n====Apprehending Lannik Racto====\n{{Quote|How did you get up here?

Suspecting them to be linked with the Disciples, the New Republic asked for the Jedi Order's help, and Korr was sent to [[Mission to Dosuun|investigate]].

Korr made his way through the facility, armed with weapons he procured from enemy troops and even hijacking an AT-ST, until he finally made his way to the hangar where his captured Z-95 was being held. Joris attacked him there with a [[Stouker concussion rifle]], hoping to stop the Jedi from escaping.

Afraid that the Disciples would pierce together clues that would lead them to other places with Force auras, he assigned the Jedi to investigate those secretive locations. The Jedi were instructed to work in pairs to avoid disasters like Penin's capture, with Korr being assigned Katarn as his partner.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Bast_Castle.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Bast Castle, the fortress of Darth Vader]]\nKorr and his Master were sent to [[Mission to Vjun (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)|investigate]] the late [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] [[Bast Castle]] on the planet [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]].

With the [[Bomber/Legends|bombers]] cleared, the two Jedi infiltrated the lower levels of the fortress, only to find their way up blocked by a closed door. Korr and Katarn then went through a garbage chute, eventually reaching a room filled with water.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nWhen Katarn attempted to use a switch to open a closed door, a [[Power conduit/Legends|power conduit]] broke off from the ceiling, though Katarn held it aloft with the Force to prevent it from falling in the water and electrifying it, which could kill both Jedi. After Korr found a way to pump the water out, the two Jedi went through the hole where the power conduit had been. Upon reaching the castle's power generator, the two redirected the power back into the generator, causing it to explode and creating a passage deeper into the castle. However, Korr and Katarn were separated as a result of the explosion.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====The fallen apprentice====\n{{Quote|Jaden, you handled yourself exceptionally well on Vjun.

Penin was accompanied by the [[Kothos twins]], [[Vil Kothos|Vil]] and [[Dasariah Kothos|Dasariah]], the two men Korr had seen siphoning the Force from the Massasi temple during the Sith cult's incursion on Yavin 4. Penin had turned to the dark side following his capture, believing that Katarn had been holding him back during his training. He boasted of the power of the dark side to Korr, and&mdash;along with the Kothos [[Twin/Legends|twins]]&mdash;engaged Korr in battle.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Dark_Penin_Korr.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Korr confronts Penin and the Kothos twins on Vjun.]]\nDuring the fight, the twins kept using the Force to [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] Penin<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> and to augment his dark side abilities. As such, Korr focused first on eliminating the twins, who displayed a variety of dark side powers and were adept at dodging lightsaber attacks. Defeating the twins sequentially,<ref name=\"Jedi Academy Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''</ref> Korr hoped that Penin would stand down without their influence. Nevertheless, Penin continued fighting, causing Korr's anger towards him to build again. After Korr defeated Penin, Katarn finally reached the throne room.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nAs Penin lay disarmed on the floor, the leader of the cult, [[Tavion Axmis]]&mdash;whom Korr had also seen alongside the Kothos twins on Yavin 4&mdash;chose to appear at that moment. After rebuking Katarn for sparing her during their [[Battle of Bespin (Empire Reborn)|previous encounter]], Axmis ripped Korr's lightsaber from him with the Force, threw it at the heavy ceiling and brought the weakened ceiling down on the Jedi with the Scepter of Ragnos, before escaping with Penin. Korr was able to use [[Kyle Katarn's third lightsaber|Katarn's lightsaber]] to cut a hole in the floor for both to escape while Katarn held the heavy rubble aloft with the Force.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nKatarn and Korr returned to the Academy and reported what they had discovered about Axmis. Korr also came up with the theory that Axmis was using the scepter's power to not only absorb Force energy, but to also discharge the energy to empower and corrupt her followers, which Katarn and Skywalker found highly plausible. Skywalker, impressed with Korr's achievements, promoted the young student to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. Nevertheless, Katarn warned Korr that he felt Korr's anger toward Penin, and despite being a Jedi Knight, he must still beware of giving in to the dark side.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====The tomb of the Barsen'thor====\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy}}\n{{Quote|Rest peacefully.|Jaden Korr closing the Barsen'thor's tomb on Chandrila|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy}}\nFollowing his promotion, Korr built a new<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> [[Jaden Korr's second lightsaber|green-bladed lightsaber]]<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> to replace the one he had lost on Vjun and became even stronger with the Force,<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> learning the third and final of the combat styles practiced by the New Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Styles\">In ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'', after the loss of the [[Jaden Korr's first lightsaber|first lightsaber]] on [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]], the player can either recreate a single [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], create two lightsabers, or a [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|double-bladed lightsaber]]. The two latter choices limit the player to one lightsaber style, medium, and only the singular blade allows Jaden Korr to wield all three styles. As ''[[Crosscurrent]]'' established that Korr's second choice of a lightsaber was a single [[Color/Legends|green]] blade, it means he must have mastered all three styles.</ref> Now a Jedi Knight, he was deemed worthy to be given more dangerous assignments by Skywalker and Katarn, in their continuing efforts to stop the Disciples.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Korr_on_chandrila.png|thumb|left|250px|Korr fights a member of the New Reborn on Chandrila.]]\nWhen the officials of the planet [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] contacted the Order for assistance, Korr was dispatched as a Jedi Order representative.

Navigating the crumbling passages of the tomb, Korr reached the resting place of the Jedi Master. Using his Force-sense ability, Korr revealed a pair of hidden panels in the walls surrounding the coffin. Pushing those buttons with the Force, Korr sealed the sarcophagus, but doing so triggered a cave-in. Korr barely escaped from the tomb as it was buried forever, ensuring that the ancient Jedi's remains would be safe from outsiders.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Katarn continued his investigation on the cult, discovering that Axmis had procured the Scepter of Ragnos from [[Unidentified collector (Commenor)|a collector]] on the planet [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]], whom she had then killed. Korr next [[Mission to Taanab|ventured]] to [[Taanab/Legends|Taanab]], where a [[Unidentified freighter captain (Taanab)|freighter captain]] had reported seeing Sith Cultists in the [[Taanab Spaceport]]. Upon arriving there, Korr witnessed the cultists releasing a [[mutant]] [[Taanab mutant rancor|rancor]], intending to unleash it upon a [[Unidentified Taanab city|nearby city]] and use the chaos to steal [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and supplies. However, the act backfired upon the Disciples, as the rancor attacked everything in sight, including them. Luring the rancor to a conveyor belt, Korr trapped it between a ray-shielded door and a large [[Cargo container/Legends|cargo container]], killing it.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====Mission to Yalara====\n{{Quote|That cloaking device is too powerful to fall into the wrong hands, cult or otherwise.

[[Jedi librarian/Legends|Jedi librarian]] [[Tionne Solusar|Tionne]] had discovered the whereabouts of the planet [[Yalara]] from a Jedi [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]]. The planet was said to be inhabited by a primitive [[Species/Legends|species]], the [[Yalaran]]s, who were not yet ready to be integrated into the galactic community. Because of that, an ancient Jedi, [[Broden Kel Verdox]], had installed a [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]] on Yalara, hiding the planet from the rest of the galaxy. However, the Order learned that the Disciples had found Yalara and had sent forces to capture the cloaking device. Afraid to let such a powerful machine fall into enemy [[Limb/Legends|hands]], Skywalker sent Korr to Yalara to secure it or destroy it, if needed.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Korr_nohgri.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Korr confronts the Noghri on Yalara.]]\nOn the planet, Korr confronted not only a large number of unified Remnant and Disciples forces, but also a third party, the [[Noghri Death Commando]]s, who were fighting for control of the cloaking device. Battling his way to the top of the complex containing the device, Korr destroyed it as he realized he could not secure it, returning to the Praxeum after doing so. Skywalker believed that his father, the late [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader, had long ago [[Mission to Yalara (Galactic Empire)|sent the Noghri]] to kill the Yalarans and guard the cloaking device.

As such, Korr and Katarn were [[Second Mission to Byss|dispatched]] to the destroyed planet, where they confirmed that Axmis had already been there. As they prepared to leave, however, the ''Raven's Claw'' was caught in the tractor beam of an Imperial [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|''Dreadnaught''-class heavy cruiser]] and was brought aboard the ship. Splitting up, Katarn&mdash;familiar with the layout of such ships from his days at the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]]&mdash;went to trigger the ship's [[Self-destruct mechanism/Legends|self-destruct mechanism]], while Korr fought his way to the tractor beam controls, disabling the beam holding the ''Claw''.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nIn order to make a clean exit corridor for the ''Raven's Claw'', Korr manned one of the [[dreadnaught]]'s turbolaser turrets, destroying some of its [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighter]] escorts.

Skywalker believed that Axmis was planning to use the power stored in the scepter to resurrect Marka Ragnos, the ancient Sith Lord after whom the Cult was named. Skywalker then assembled the Jedi for an [[Battle of Korriban (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)|all-out attack]] on the Sith graveyard world of [[Korriban]], the resting place of Ragnos. However, before embarking on the mission, Katarn informed Korr that he had received a message from Penin, who claimed to have repented of his actions and wished to rejoin the Jedi Order but was being held captive on the planet [[Taspir III]].<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nKorr suspected that Penin might be leading them into a trap, but Katarn was willing to take the risk if it meant saving his other student. Korr and Katarn therefore detoured to Taspir III to [[Mission to Taspir III|rescue]] Penin from the cult. Once there, Katarn dropped Korr of at a landing pad near the [[Taspir III power plant|power plant]] where Penin was supposedly being held, while he took the ''Raven's Claw'' to approach from another direction, believing that the two had better chances to complete the mission if they split up.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nNavigating through the multiple levels of the plant, Korr encountered Alora, who taunted him, claiming that Penin had fully embraced the dark side. Pursuing Alora through automated conveyor belts, Korr finally reached Penin, but at the sight of him seemingly unharmed, his anger rose, believing that his former friend had lured him into a trap. Alora, who stood on a balcony above them and watched, thought Korr's feelings could drive him to the dark side, and she tried to amplify his rage to gain a new ally and make him kill Penin. Penin became afraid of Korr's growing anger and admitted to him that that he had fallen due to his fear. He also reminded Korr that anger was the path to the dark side.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Penin_Katarn_Alora_Korr.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Korr and Katarn rescue Penin from Taspir III.]]\nKatarn also [[Telepathy/Legends|contacted]] Korr mentally, urging him to forgive Penin. The combined words of his friend and his mentor allowed Korr to let go of his anger, realizing he had let it control him, and he did not attack Penin. With her gamble having failed, Alora attacked Penin herself, [[Cho sun/Legends|slicing off]] his left arm, and engaged Korr in battle.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> Since their last encounter, Alora had trained extensively to avenge her defeat on Hoth and was now [[Jar'Kai/Legends|wielding two lightsabers]] simultaneously,<ref name=\"Jedi Academy Guide\" /> however Korr was able to defeat her in battle, killing her. When Katarn caught up with his students, he commended Korr for not giving into the dark side, but Korr gave the credit to Penin for having reminded him of the dangers of anger.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n====Confronting the Sith Lord====\n{{Quote|A mere Jedi child will not undo my return!|Marka Ragnos|audio=29mar002.ogg|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy}}\nLeaving Penin in the care of Katarn, Korr flew to Korriban, where he joined up with Skywalker's Jedi strike force to stop the cult once and for all. Assisted by his fellow Jedi, he fought numerous Disciples of Ragnos and Remnant forces throughout the [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|Valley of the Dark Lords]] and finally reached the [[Tomb of Marka Ragnos]], where he confronted Axmis before she could resurrect Ragnos. Axmis, believing that by killing Korr she would convince Katarn of his failure as a Master and would bring her old nemesis over to the dark side, fought with fury and hatred, using the Scepter of Ragnos in addition to her lightsaber to boost her advantage.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nAxmis used the weapon to fire beams of energy at the Jedi, while also using her Force powers to create earthquakes.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy Guide\" /> However, Korr was able to overcome the Dark Jedi's assault and defeated her, though Axmis refused to surrender. She used the scepter on a statue of Ragnos, resurrecting his spirit, who [[Possession/Legends|possessed]] her. Ragnos revealed that the scepter doubled as a holster for a [[Sith sword]], and he fought Korr with the weapon.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Ragnos_Korr.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Korr witnesses the spirit of Marka Ragnos leaving Axmis's body.]]\nThe possessed Axmis was bolstered by the power of the Sith [[Sword/Legends|sword]], which kept replenishing her energy and made her invulnerable for short periods of time.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy Guide\" /> Despite her advantage, Korr defeated her and destroyed the scepter, causing Ragnos to leave Axmis's body, vowing to have his revenge another day. Axmis's body could not withstand the corruption and died shortly thereafter. Korr left the tomb and used his lightsaber to seal it forever.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nHe was joined by Skywalker and Katarn on the steps of the mausoleum, who commended him on his efforts and proclaimed him a true Knight of the Order.

With the scepter destroyed, the remaining Disciples of Ragnos lost their power and were soon rounded up. Back at the Jedi Praxeum, Korr visited Penin, who had received a new [[Cybernetics/Legends|prosthetic arm]] and was recovering after his brush with the dark side.

A strike team of Jedi, led by Jedi Master [[Kyp Durron]] and [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Toval Seyah]] was assembled with the purpose of infiltrating the [[Space station/Legends|station]] and sabotaging it, preventing it from falling into Solo's hands.

One night, however, he received a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] from the Force. In the vision, Korr found himself on the surface of a frozen moon near a [[Unidentified gas giant (UR-2212-GR system)|blue ringed gas giant]] in the Unknown Regions, surrounded by the voices of Jedi and Sith, most of them dead, calling his name.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nOne of the voices, belonging to the [[Skirmish on Kavan|deceased]] Mara Jade Skywalker, told him to seek answers in the \"[[Black hole/Legends|black hole]] on [[Fhost]].\" Korr then heard a voice calling for help and witnessed an explosion in the sky that rained down dark side energy, leaving him sickened. As his consciousness drifted back into reality, Korr felt perplexed by the instructions given to him by Jade Skywalker in his vision, since he knew that there were no black holes anywhere near the planet Fhost. He asked [[R6-series astromech droid|R6]] to search [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] for any [[Star system/Legends|star systems]] like the one he had seen in a vision, but the search returned no results. Hoping to find answers that would bring him peace of mind, Korr took the ''Far Wanderer'' and R6 and left for Fhost without informing the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\n[[File:Marr_Idi-Shael.jpg|thumb|right|150px|During his quest, Korr met the Force-sensitive Marr Idi-Shael.]]\nUpon his arrival, Korr landed at [[Farpoint]], the sole city located on the planet, built on the remains of a crashed starship, where he learned of the existence of the [[Black Hole (Fhost)|Black Hole]] cantina. While staying at the cantina, Korr heard rumors that the crew of the salvage vessel [[Junker (YT-2400 light freighter)|''Junker'']] had stumbled on an automated distress beacon in the Unknown Regions, in a star system whose description sounded similar to the one from his vision. Convinced that the scavengers would lead him to his goal, Korr waited for ''Junker''{{'s}} [[Captain/Legends|captain]], [[Khedryn Faal]], in the cantina on Fhost, posing as a [[Junk dealer/Legends|scrap dealer]] from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]].<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nWhen Faal arrived at the cantina, Korr approached him and attempted to use a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] on Faal in order to secure passage aboard his ship. He was interrupted by Faal's first mate, the [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] [[Marr Idi-Shael]], who urged Faal to partake in a [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] game with fellow scavenger [[Reegas Vance]]. Korr agreed to wait until the game was over and observed it from his table. Faal lost the [[data crystal]] containing the coordinates of the moon to Vance, but he still remembered the coordinates and was intent to get to the star system first, causing Vance to agree to a double-or-nothing round for the exclusive rights to the coordinates. Sensing that the game was rigged in Vance's favor, Korr used the Force to help Faal win the crystal back, causing one of Vance's cronies, [[Earsh]], to accuse Faal of [[Cheater|cheating]] and start a [[Brawl in the Black Hole|brawl]]. In the ensuing fight, Korr was forced to kill Earsh and then helped the crew of the ''Junker'' escape from the cantina to their parked swoop bikes and make it back to their [[YT-2400 light freighter/Legends|freighter]].<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\n====Meeting Druur====\n{{Dialogue|Korr|You are a Jedi.|Druur|As are you.|Faal|Now it's a party.|attr=Korr, upon first meeting the ancient Jedi|src=Crosscurrent}}\nThe [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] agreed to [[Mission to the frozen moon|bring Korr]] to the frozen moon of his vision for a sizable monetary reward, but since Faal did not tolerate droids, Korr was prevented from bringing R6 aboard. Korr then contacted his droid, whom he had left at the ''Far Wanderer'', telling him to take the Z-95 to orbit and wait for him for two [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]]; if Korr did not return by that point, R6 was instructed to return to Coruscant and inform Grand Master Skywalker of Korr's whereabouts. Korr also discovered that Idi-Shael, a mathematical savant, was in fact Force-sensitive. The Jedi and the crew of ''Junker'' arrived at the system and picked up the distress call coming from the frozen moon.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\n[[File:Relin-Crosscurrent.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jaden Korr met a five-thousand year old Jedi, Relin Druur, during his quest.]]\nSoon thereafter, they witnessed the arrival of an unknown vessel, and Korr felt a dark side aura emanating from it, which he identified as Sith. Something then attached itself to ''Junker'', and Korr, sensing that an intruder was trying to get aboard, rushed to confront that person. The object that attached itself to the hull of the salvage ship turned out to be an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]]. It's sole occupant&mdash;a man who was missing one arm and looked sick&mdash;attacked Korr with an [[Protosaber|archaic lightsaber]], with a powercord attached to a [[Battery/Legends|battery]] pack on his belt. After a brief duel, Korr and the intruder sensed that neither of them was Sith; they were both Jedi.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nThe man was named [[Relin Druur]], and he was a Jedi Knight from a different [[Post-Manderon period|time period]].

Look to your feelings.|Druur, to Korr|Crosscurrent}}\nDruur was determined to finish his job and destroy the ''Harbinger'', which carried aboard a cargo of powerful [[Lignan crystal]]s that could amplify dark side powers and which Korr recognized as the source of sickness in his vision. Korr felt Druur falling to the dark side in his anger over the death of his other Padawan, [[Drev Hassin]], who had perished in the initial attack on the ''Harbinger''. Druur in turn felt Korr lost in doubt, and they both agreed that they had to go separate ways to deal with the issues plaguing them. Aboard the ''Harbinger'', Rrogon also realized what had happened, and he sent several [[Blade-class starfighter|''Blade''-class starfighters]] to destroy ''Junker'' and kill Druur.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nSince Faal's ship had no weapons equipped, Korr used the Force to help him pilot the freighter through the belts of debris orbiting the gas giant, while Druur manned the rear mounted tractor beam to pick up massive rocks from the debris field and redirect them into the pursuing Blades. Faal then jettisoned the contents of ''Junker''{{'s}} cargo hold so that they created an explosion when they collided with the rocks, causing the remaining Blades to believe that the salvage vessel had been destroyed and to report back to the ''Harbinger''.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\n[[File:Kam_Solusar_NEGTC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Korr fought Alpha, a clone of Jedi Master Kam Solusar, on the frozen moon.]]\nAfter convincing the crew of ''Junker'' that the Force had brought them all to the moon, the two Jedi decided that Idi-Shael would fly Druur into the ''Harbinger''{{'s}} landing bay to [[Mission to the Harbinger|destroy]] the ship, while Faal would land Korr on the moon using a small [[Starhawk shuttle]], [[Flotsam (starship)|''Flotsam'']], attached to the scavenger vessel. After landing on the moon and following the distress beacon, Korr and Faal discovered Thrawn's secret research facility. By investigating the facility and managing to restore some of the old recordings, they learned that the clones had [[Clone madness|gone mad]]. They had managed to find parts to create lightsabers and had [[Carnage on the frozen moon|killed]] all the scientists and stormtroopers. Faal suggested leaving the moon at once, but Korr was too obsessed to turn around and told Faal to leave while he continued alone to the lower levels of the installation. Although initially hesitant to leave Korr alone, Faal's self-preservation instinct convinced him to walk away.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nHoping that clones who could use both the dark and [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light sides]] like himself would provide him with answers to his dilemma, Korr advanced through the site of the carnage until he reached a Spaarti cloning cylinder&mdash;made into an altar for someone the clones called \"[[Mother (Rakatan entity)|Mother]]\"&mdash;which the clones had filled with the remains of the scientists and stormtroopers. There, he encountered [[Alpha (clone)|Alpha]], a clone of Jedi Master [[Kam Solusar]], who informed him that the clones would use Korr's ship to leave the moon.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nThe two fought until Alpha took three fingers off Korr's right hand with [[Jaden Korr's third lightsaber|his lightsaber]], leaving only the thumb and the forefinger and causing Korr's lightsaber to get lost in the cloning tank. Alpha then tried to drown the Jedi in the waste filling the cloning cylinder. Faced with fear of death, Korr briefly unleashed [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] upon Alpha, but he realized just in time that he had let the dark side swell in him. Right when Alpha was about to deliver the killing blow, Korr pulled out his purple-bladed lightsaber and killed the clone by [[Shiak|stabbing him through the chest]].<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\n====Attaining clarity====\n{{Quote|I will teach you more about the Force, Marr.\"''<br />''\"You will?\"''<br />''\"You may come to wish you'd never learned from me.|Korr speaks to Idi-Shael after his return from the ''Harbinger''|Crosscurrent}}\n[[File:Crosscurrent_by_Chris_Scalf.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Kell Douro attempts to feed on Jaden Korr.]]\nExhausted, Korr left the cloning cylinder only to run into [[Kell Douro]], an [[Anzat (species)|Anzat]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] and an agent of the [[One Sith]] organization, whom Korr had first unknowingly encountered at the Black Hole cantina on Fhost, where Douro had been posing as a drunken spacer and had bumped into Korr. Having lost sight of the Jedi during the brawl inside the cantina, Douro had followed him from Fhost to the frozen moon, believing that he would find revelation by consuming a Jedi's [[Soup (Anzati)|brain material]]. Too weak to fight back, Korr was assaulted by Douro but was saved by Faal, who had returned to help his friend and who killed Douro with a blaster shot to the head. With his other lightsaber nowhere to be found, Korr picked up Alpha's weapon and left the station with Faal, heading toward ''Flotsam''. On the surface of the moon, they witnessed the assassin's [[CloakShape fighter/Legends|CloakShape fighter]] [[Predator (Kell Douro's ship)|''Predator'']] landing beside them, the remaining<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> Community<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> of clones and their children, ten beings in total, aboard.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nBelieving that the clones would not kill them, Korr promised to hunt them down should they escape from the moon and turned his back to them. The clones indeed did not kill the Jedi, instead leaving the moon, right as the ''Harbinger'' was destroyed. The clones took the CloakShape through the scattered remains of the Lignan crystals in the [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]] of the moon,<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> which greatly amplified their powers but also accelerated the sickness, which was caused by the genetic instability that the clones experienced.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nKorr and Faal then witnessed ''Junker'', piloted by an injured Idi-Shael, approaching the surface. Korr and Faal found Idi-Shael unconscious inside the ship, and they tended to his wounds. When the Cerean awoke, he told his companions that Druur, having fully embraced the dark side, had [[Suicide/Legends|killed himself]] to destroy the ''Harbinger''. He also related Druur's last words to Korr, that there was no certainty, just the search for it, and the danger was only when one thought that he had found the certainty. Korr realized that he could not rid himself of doubt, but he should rather embrace it.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nHe accepted that his role as a Jedi personally involved the acceptance of doubt. He suspected that his Master had known this all along and that his ordeal with his new friends was designed to teach him that lesson. Korr, Faal, and Idi-Shael then decided to hunt the remaining clones together. Idi-Shael, having also explored some of his Force-sensitivity with Druur aboard the ''Harbinger'', asked Korr to take him on as an apprentice. Believing Idi-Shael to be too old for training, Korr decided that he would need to ask permission from Grand Master Skywalker first.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\n====Pursuit of the clones====\n{{Quote|Now I want you to find the clones.

Apologizing for not informing him of his departure, Korr told Skywalker everything about his doubts, his journey to the frozen moon, the encounter with Druur and the discovery of the clones. Master Skywalker, though concerned with Korr's action in not leaving a flight schedule, told him to destroy the clones if they proved to be beyond the hope of saving. Skywalker promised to send help to deal with the clones, but he was afraid the reinforcements would not arrive soon enough. Skywalker also gave Korr approval to train Idi-Shael in the ways of the Force. Korr then returned to his friends, discovering that Idi-Shael had already put his mathematical talent to good use and had charted an approximate area of the Unknown Regions where the clones could have gone.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n[[File:Red_Color_Crystal.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Korr purified Alpha's red lightsaber crystal.]]\nKorr, however, decided to start their search by going back to the [[Fhost system]]. On their way, Korr informed Idi-Shael that he was now his apprentice, and the two proceeded into the freighter's cargo hold. There, Korr gave Idi-Shael his original purple-bladed lightsaber, making him disassemble and reassemble the weapon to learn its inner workings. He then sparred with the Cerean using Alpha's lightsaber and trained Marr in the deflection of blaster bolts, teaching his apprentice how to use his mathematical genius to calculate the correct angles of attack and deflection. Telling his apprentice to keep the lightsaber, he made his way into one of the passenger cabins with the one he had claimed from Alpha, where he used the Force to [[cleanse]] the clone weapon's [[Lightsaber crystal|crystal]] of impurities.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nIn doing so, Korr removed any traces of the dark side from the [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]], which was also turned from red to yellow. Idi-Shael later informed Korr that he believed that the clones did not deserve to be hunted and asked his Master why they could not just let them go free, but Korr&mdash;having witnessed the carnage at the facility on the frozen moon&mdash;was intent on stopping the escapees.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n====Enter Soldier====\n{{Quote|I got good looks at the clones.

The droid informed him that a [[Farpoint Medical Center|medical facility]] in Farpoint was under attack, all clues indicating that the attackers were the escaping clones. Korr realized that the clones were sick and that they intended to capture a [[medical supply ship]] to procure medicine to combat their condition, so he ordered Faal to land ''Junker'' on the roof of the medical facility, while Idi-Shael raised a schematic of the [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]]. Once their ship made contact with the roof, Korr planted one of the [[Transponder beacon/Legends|transponder beacons]], which the scavengers used to mark their findings to track them later, onto a [[Unidentified medical supply ship|parked medical supply ship]], and he and Idi-Shael separated in order to block off any means of escape via the roof and intercept the clones as they made their way upstairs.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n[[File:ShiraBrie-CSWE.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Korr encountered a number of clones on Fhost, including that of Lumiya.]]\nAs Korr made his way down the west stairwell, he heard the sounds of a commotion three floors below him.

Korr then [[Skirmish at the Farpoint Medical Center|engaged]] one of the clones, [[Runner (clone)|Runner]], the clone of Kyle Katarn, knocking him unconscious, before being attacked by another clone, Soldier. After more than thirty years since the Empire had taken a DNA sample from him without his consent, Korr finally discovered that there existed a clone of himself, which shocked him. The other three clones present at the scene were [[Seer (clone)|Seer]], whom Korr recognized as the clone of the dead Dark Lady of the Sith [[Lumiya]]; the red-haired female [[Hunter (clone)|Hunter]], who was unconscious and was being carried by her comrades; and the young girl [[Grace (Human)|Grace]]. The rest of the clones who had left the frozen moon had succumbed to their genetic sickness and had died by that point.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nKorr's surprise at the discovery of Soldier's identity left a hole in his defense, which Soldier exploited, hurtling him into a wall. Soldier and Runner, who had come to his senses, then assaulted Korr with [[Force blast|blasts]] of the Force from two sides, forcing Korr to channel all his powers to resist the attacks. While the two clones nearly overwhelmed him, he was able to combat their powers with his own, and Seer was forced to enter the fight in order to overpower his Force defenses. Korr ultimately could not handle the onslaught and gave way to the clones' powers, and Soldier blasted him with Force lightning, injuring him. As Runner moved in to execute him, Korr, on the edge of his consciousness, blocked Runner's killing strike, only to have the clone kick him in the face and send him flying down the next landing of the stairs. Preparing for a follow-up attack, Korr rose up to his feet, but a misstep caused him to fall even further down the stairs.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n====Battle in open space====\n{{Quote|Trust me when I tell you that's the life. Nothing ever goes according to plan. Half the time I'm just making it up as I go. Get used to it, eh?|Korr, to Idi-Shael|Riptide (novel)}}\nThe clones chose not to pursue the Jedi and escaped. A few [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]] later, Idi-Shael discovered his Master lying unconscious and helped him to the roof of the facility, only to find out that Faal was missing. The two found the [[Unidentified medical supply ship captain|captain]] and the [[Unidentified medical supply ship first mate|first mate]] of the medical ship, who informed them that Faal had saved the crew of the ship when he had forced them to evacuate the ship before the clones captured it. However, the clones had taken Faal, intending to learn from him how Korr had been able to find them. Korr and Idi-Shael then departed Fhost aboard ''Junker'', but not before picking up R6 from the ''Far Wanderer''.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n[[File:Khedryn_Faal.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Korr was willing to surrender himself to Nyss Nenn to rescue Khedryn Faal.]]\nWith the tracker aboard the medical supply ship, Korr and Idi-Shael were able catch up to the transport in a [[UR-5292-FH system|star system with two gas giants]], where they were hailed by an [[Umbaran/Legends|Umbaran]] who identified himself as [[Nyss Nenn]], another agent of the One Sith. Claiming that he had taken control of the clones' ship, he demanded Korr to take a [[hardsuit]] and fly alone toward the medical ship to trade himself for Faal. If Korr refused to comply, Nenn would kill Faal.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nKorr was forced to agree to the terms and exited ''Junker'' into open space, when he was contacted by Faal, who informed the Jedi that he had already escaped from the ship with Grace's help, and he was currently located inside one of the two escape pods that had just launched from the medical ship. The second escape pod carried Nenn aboard, who had himself escaped from the transport after Soldier and Seer&mdash;the only two clones still alive after the Umbaran had killed Hunter and Runner&mdash;had taken back control of the medical ship.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nOnce Korr and Faal were at the midpoint of the ships, another vessel entered the fray, a [[Nyss Nenn's scout flyer|scout flyer]] piloted by the Umbaran's sister, [[Syll Nenn]], who [[Skirmish at the medical supply ship|fired]] at Faal's pod. In a split [[Standard second|second]], Korr reached out with the Force to pull Faal's pod out of harm's way. A second shot was fired, but this time Korr grabbed onto the pod's antennae for purchase and used the Force to guide his lightsaber as it met with the projectile and redirected it back to the ship's [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]].<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nThe impact killed Syll, just as Nyss returned to the [[scout flyer]] and fled. Korr's usage of the Force applied too much stress to his hardsuit, causing it to tear and allow [[Oxygen/Legends|oxygen]] to vent, resulting in Korr nearly losing his consciousness, but he was quickly dragged back inside ''Junker'' by Idi-Shael. Korr, Faal, and Idi-Shael made their way to the cockpit, and Faal sent the freighter into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] in pursuit of the clones, following the beacon still planted aboard their ship.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n====Aboard Mother====\n{{Quote|We are not alone here.\"''<br />''\"No. We're not.|Korr and Idi-Shael, aboard Mother|Riptide (novel)}}\nThe moment their ship came out of hyperspace, Korr and his companions saw a [[UR-6572-AK system|system]] containing a [[Unidentified pulsar|pulsar]], [[Unidentified planet (Mother)|two]] [[Unidentified planet 2 (Mother)|tide-locked planets]] and an [[Unidentified asteroid belt|asteroid belt]] of unnatural origin. Korr and Idi-Shael speculated that the [[asteroid belt]] had been created as a result of the destruction of a device belonging to an ancient civilization, like the [[Celestial/Legends|Celestials]] or the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Infinite Empire]], and that the system's [[Star/Legends|star]] had been turned into a [[Pulsar/Legends|pulsar]] in the process. Korr then had R6 send a message to the Jedi Order, notifying its members of his discoveries up until that point.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n[[File:Infinite_Empire.svg|thumb|left|100px|The space station known as \"Mother\" was constructed by the Rakatan Infinite Empire.]]\nThe system was filled with radiation coming from the pulsar and appeared lifeless, leading Faal to believe that the clones had gotten away, but Korr felt a disturbance in the Force and directed Faal to fly toward the space between the two planets. On the dark side of the nearest planet, they found a massive space station that was emanating dark side power. The station, organic in composition, was connected to the planet below by a long tether. Believing the station to be Rakatan in origin, judging by its dark side aura, Korr witnessed the medical supply ship docked with it. [[Mission to Mother|Approaching]] the station, Korr and Idi-Shael used ''Flotsam'' in order for them to dock with the station, deeming it too dangerous for Faal to go there and relegating him to fly ''Junker'' to a safe distance.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nOnce the shuttle docked with the station, Korr and his apprentice continued their pursuit of the clones. Along the way, the station, seemingly self-aware, appeared to have sensed the presence of the Jedi, as [[Zombie/Legends|corpses]] of various sentient beings, reanimated with the power of the dark side, were appearing before them, ready to kill the two. Korr and Idi-Shael ignited their lightsabers and took their stand against the impending danger.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nAfter the confrontation, the pair used separate kilometer-long shafts to descend to the planetary levels of the station; they proceeded further and further on, even as the aura of the dark side grew. With little warning, Nenn, who had also infiltrated the station, attacked Idi-Shael and Korr with a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]], using his unique gift to [[Sever Force/Legends|block]] the pair's connection with the Force. The Cerean was attacked first and was knocked out, then Nenn turned to Korr, heavily injuring him. However, the Umbaran stopped to speak a code word in a [[Language/Legends|language]] unfamiliar to Korr. Judging by Nenn's reaction, the word was meant to have some kind of effect on the Jedi. When the phrase did not work, Korr used Nenn's confusion to launch a surprise [[Unarmed combat|melee attack]] and, after a brief fight, he strangled the Umbaran to death.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n====The apprentice's secret====\n{{Quote|Do you remember what happened?\"''<br />''\"Everything's blurry right now. I reinjured these somehow.|Korr, looking upon his bleeding fingers|Riptide (novel)}}\nAfter the scuffle, Korr passed out due to loss of [[Blood/Legends|blood]] and was approached by [[the Iteration]], another clone of himself, brought aboard by Nenn and created by the One Sith with the purpose of replacing Korr as an [[Spy/Legends|inside agent]] within the Jedi Order. The clone stuck the device called the Rakatan [[mindspear]] into Korr's [[Brain/Legends|brain]], filling it with Korr's memories and killing Korr in the process. The clone intended to transfer those memories later into his own brain to update the information he had already had on Korr's life. Idi-Shael, however, came to his senses and fought against the clone, but was soon disarmed. Korr's apprentice, however, was able to incapacitate the clone with his bare hands.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n[[File:Korr-Riptide.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaden Korr during the hunt for the clones]]\nRealizing that his Master's body had no pulse, Idi-Shael acted on instinct and used the mindspear to transfer Korr's memories into the clone, before the [[Iteration]] was completely ready to accept them. In doing so, the Cerean hoped that instead of fulfilling the Iteration's plan he would have his Master be reborn in the Iteration's body. In an effort to hide the events that had transpired, Idi-Shael dressed the Iteration in Korr's clothes, hid Korr's body and severed three fingers from the Iteration's hand to match Korr's injury. After about a few minutes, Korr woke up from his unconscious state and pulled himself up off the ground.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nHe initially did not remember anything about who he was, but Idi-Shael soon called him out, and his voice caused the memories to flood Korr, with the exception of the last few moments of his life. Korr did not remember himself dying, believing that he had been merely knocked unconscious by the Umbaran. However, Korr did notice that his three missing fingers had started to bleed, and he wondered why the wound had opened again. Idi-Shael, meanwhile, was taken hostage by Soldier, who wished to escape from the station with Grace.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nSoldier was disillusioned with Seer's promises to meet \"Mother\"&mdash;the consciousness of the Rakatan station that had been calling the clones from the time they had first heard it on the frozen moon&mdash;after witnessing Mother killing Seer. Seeing that Soldier did not harm Idi-Shael when he had the chance and hearing that Soldier had not personally killed any innocents on Fhost, Korr believed Soldier's intentions, and the four&mdash;Korr, Idi-Shael, Soldier and Grace&mdash;attempted to make their way back to ''Junker''. As they made their escape, Korr also noticed that his apprentice behaved himself strangely, seemingly feeling cautious of his Master. However, they were soon confronted by Seer, her body inhabited by Mother and covered in organic filaments peeling away from the walls of the station. After a fierce fight, Korr barely managed to wound Mother.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n====The escape====\n{{Quote|Do you think they got clear in time?\"''<br />''\"Soldier?\"''<br />''\"And Grace.\"''<br />''\"I don't know. I think so. I hope so.|Faal and Korr, after their escape from the space station|Riptide (novel)}}\nRealizing that they were no match for the entity, Korr, Idi-Shael, Grace and Soldier hurried to escape from the station. On their way, they were contacted by Faal via comlink, who had ventured inside the station in an effort to warn them about Nenn, but had been knocked unconscious by the Umbaran. Hoping to destroy the station, Korr directed Faal to the still docked medical supply ship, instructing him to set its systems on overload, deducing that the explosion of the ship as large as the medical transport would take out the entire station.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nFaal did as instructed, and Korr, Idi-Shael, Soldier and Grace took the organic lifts back up to the space portion of Mother, still pursued by the maddened entity, and they met Faal there. Stating that Grace needed medicine to combat the genetic instability, Soldier told Korr that he would attempt to get some from the medical ship before it exploded, and they would then escape aboard Nenn's ship, docked near the medical transport. Korr agreed to that plan, and Soldier took Grace and parted ways with his genetic template. Korr, Idi-Shael and Faal ran to the docking bay, raising R6 on the comm, as Mother also went up the lifts and continued her pursuit. The droid prepared ''Junker'' for takeoff, and when everyone was aboard, R6 sped away from the station.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n[[File:Junker.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Korr and his friends escaped from Mother aboard ''Junker''.]]\nThe ancient space station was then destroyed, taking Mother's new body with it. Soldier and Grace had also been able to escape, hoping to find a safe haven to live out the rest of their days in peace. As Korr made his way to the confines of the freighter, he presented his report to the Jedi Order and then cleaned himself up. However, as he was about to shave, Korr noticed that the facial scar he had gotten when he was a young child had vanished. Korr looked at himself in the mirror, at where his scar once was, and he then wondered why Idi-Shael had been acting strange since their departure from the station.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n===Jedi madness===\n====The Force psychosis====\n{{Quote|Now, Jedi Korr, perhaps you'd be good enough to tell us why you ignored orders and allowed the Solos to interrupt us?''\"<br />\"''I'm sorry, Master Horn.

Korr was warned by Hamner that the two could be very persuasive. Indeed, the couple soon arrived in the foyer to the chambers, and Korr initially upheld his mandate to bar entrance to everyone. However, as Solo pulled Korr aside to inform him that an attack on the Temple by [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Mandalorian Supercommando|Supercommandos]] hired by Daala to carry out the arrests was imminent, Organa Solo forced her way past the apprentices.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nBelieving that the Council needed to hear the Solos' information, Korr was intent to let them pass anyway.

The Jedi attempted the move in a lower level hangar in the [[Temple district]], using [[tranquilizer dart]]s to subdue Hellin, Wan, and Saav'etu and placing them into [[Suspended animation/Legends|stasis]] beds aboard a [[FloatVan]] [[Airspeeder/Legends|airspeeder]] to be transported to the planet [[Shedu Maad]] in the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]].<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\n[[File:Exilecropped.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Korr assisted Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo with defending the victims of Force psychosis.]]\nHowever, Warv, a hulking [[Ramoan]], was resistant to tranquilizers, so he had to be restrained and escorted to the FloatVan while being conscious. In order to prevent Warv from escaping, Korr and a number of other Jedi carried [[ysalamir]]i creatures that were able to block an individual's connection with the Force. The Solos had found out that the Mandalorians hired by Daala were stationed in the nearby [[Krabbis Inn]], and Han requested Korr and Arelis to help them against a possible Mandalorian attack, while the other Jedi continued to try moving Warv. When discovered, most of the Mandalorians tried to escape in order to hide their ties with Daala, while five Supercommandos attacked the Solos as a distraction.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nKorr and Arelis each engaged one Mandalorian, who were equipped with lightsaber-resistant [[Mandalorian armor/Legends|armor]] made from [[Mandalorian iron|beskar]] iron. Four of the Mandalorians were killed, but when only one was left standing, he was suddenly attacked by Warv, who had escaped from custody. Warv grabbed the Mandalorian and, surprisingly for Korr and the Solos, demonstrated a unique ability to [[phase]] through solid matter, bypassing the armor completely and killing the Mandalorian with his bare hands&mdash;an ability that had developed as a side effect of the Force psychosis. After the fight was over, Warv, still delusional, refused to go to the Hapes Cluster, and Korr and his companions were prepared to subdue him.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nHowever, Jedi Knight [[Raynar Thul]] arrived at the scene, and together with Organa Solo, they were able to convince Warv to load aboard the FloatVan. As the Solos prepared to leave with the sick Jedi, Korr and Arelis agreed to stay behind and cover up the mess before the [[Galactic Alliance Security]].

Although Korr thought that people could change and believed in the possibility of redemption,<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> having previously witnessed the cause of Penin,<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> he also believed that by killing so many innocent people the clones had passed beyond their chance at self-determination.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n[[File:Cloning_Centre.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Korr was determined to stop the escaping clones.]]\nKorr was surprised that one of the escaping clones was a clone of himself, having no explanation for how Thrawn's scientists had managed to obtain a genetic sample from him before he had even joined the Praxeum. While chasing the clones at Farpoint's medical center and meeting the captain and the first mate of the supply ship, Korr was in a hurry to explain his motivations to the pair. Therefore, he only told them that the beings who had taken their ship were the \"bad guys\" and he and Idi-Shael were the \"good guys.\"<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nLater, while leaving the medical center in pursuit of the clones, Korr witnessed the supply ship's first mate waving him a goodbye. The man's gesture was heartwarming to Korr and reaffirmed his belief that he was, indeed, \"a good guy.\" During the events aboard the Rakatan station, Korr decided to let Soldier go free, believing the clone's words that he would not harm anyone and would care for Grace.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n===Attachment to personal belongings===\n{{Quote|<s></s>''Far Wanderer'', permission granted.

Korr fondly remembered his uncle Orn, whom he gave the nickname \"Uncle Orn the Hutt,\" due to his obesity.

However, he did find it irritating that Penin always tried to surpass him in training. Korr was disappointed to find that Penin had gone to the dark side, and when he confronted the unharmed Penin on Taspir III, he believed that the fallen apprentice had led him into a trap. Korr nearly let his anger take the better of him, but Penin and Katarn's warnings about the dangers of the dark side allowed him to hold back and spare his fellow apprentice.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n=====Khedryn Faal and Marr Idi-Shael=====\n{{Quote|I knew I liked you, Jedi.|Khedryn Faal, whom Korr befriended during his journey|Crosscurrent}}\nOne major outcome of Korr's vision quest was his meeting with Idi-Shael, who requested to become his apprentice.

He also respected Grand Master Skywalker, finding that no matter how many years had passed, he always felt himself a student when talking to him,<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> and the very notion to address him by his name rather than his title, which Faal demonstrated, seemed incongruous to him. It also saddened him to learn of Mara Jade Skywalker's death.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nIn his communication to the Grand Master after the events on the frozen moon, Korr found great relief in telling Skywalker everything that had plagued his mind, and he felt more himself after the conversation, a fact that did not escape Skywalker's eyes.<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> Korr also had some sort of affectionate relationship with the young Jedi [[Valin Horn]], who had participated in the mission to Centerpoint Station, and he regretted distancing from him.

Inside the Barsen'thor's tomb, this ability allowed him to reveal the switches that sealed off the ancient Jedi's resting place.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> Korr could even sense how his own presence felt, experiencing it as the presence of a light side user who was tainted by something, which proved to be his feeling of doubt.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nKorr was able to influence the minds of other beings with the Force, and he tried to use the technique to influence Faal in order to convince him to listen to him during his first meeting. Faal, born to [[Outbound Flight Colony|survivors]] of the Outbound Flight Project and therefore familiar with Jedi and their powers, later asked Korr to never attempt a mind trick on him again.

Katarn taught Korr that the Force was inherently neither light nor dark, and one could use the powers traditionally affiliated with either side.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nAccording to Katarn, transcending the constant desire to categorize things would lead Korr to a deeper understanding of his own role in the Force. Unlike Katarn, Korr was for the longest time plagued with doubt over his ability to utilize dark side techniques, questioning his identity as a Jedi. Each time Force lightning cracked at the tips of his fingers, he felt as if his hands were betraying him and he had to restrain himself from using it during his fight with Alpha.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\nHowever, after reaching the end of his vision quest, Korr accepted what his Master had been trying to tell him all along. He knew that he would never fall to the dark side, as he knew it too well. From that point on, Korr felt secure in his knowledge that he would always have control of his powers and would never subconsciously summon lightning from his fingers anymore.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" />\n\n====Other Force techniques====\n{{Quote|Master Katarn&ndash;my Master&ndash;called it the Sanctum.

Korr was often portrayed in promotional art, on the back cover of the game disc&mdash;with the same image reused for the back cover of the [[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|game's official guide]] as well&mdash;as a male Human with reddish-brown hair<ref name=\"Jedi Academy Guide\" /> but was also portrayed as a Twi'lek female in the ''[[Planet Hoppers]]&mdash;[[Hoth: Under the Ice]]'' web supplement.<ref name=\"Under the Ice\" />\n\nThe first information on Korr's identity came from the [[2005]] reference book ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'', which addressed Korr as a \"he,\" invalidating all female options in the game.<ref name=\"NEC\" /> Despite mentioning Korr, ''Fury'' remained ambiguous on his appearance.<ref name=\"Fury\" /> However, ''Abyss'' established him as a brown-haired male. Although it did not necessarily specify his species, it excluded Rodian and Kel Dor from consideration,<ref name=\"Abyss\" /> as all Kel Dor and all male Rodians are naturally hairless,<ref name=\"NEGAS\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Alien Species]]''</ref> only leaving Human as a possibility. The description in the novel matched one of the Human avatars in the game, the exact one used to portray the character in promotional art.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nKorr's subsequent portrayal in ''Crosscurrent'' and ''Riptide'' reaffirmed the description outlined in ''Abyss'', explicitly stating that Korr was a Human. Kemp's novels also established that Korr wore a goatee<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> as of 41 ABY,<ref name=\"ERC\" /> which the author wrote in as a homage to Katarn, signifying the fact that Korr leaned heavily on his Master's teachings during his crisis of faith.<ref name=\"Paul Kemp beard\">{{JCFcite|postnum=30742150|board=Literature|thread=Paul S.

After the mission to Vjun, players have an option to build a single new lightsaber, two new lightsabers or a [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|double-bladed one]], with in-game dialogue stating that Korr's first lightsaber was destroyed on Vjun.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nHowever, ''Crosscurrent'' featured Korr in possession of two lightsabers, establishing that Korr's first weapon was purple in color and his second one was a green-bladed single lightsaber.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> This information also established Korr's mastery of all three lightsaber styles of the New Jedi Order, as one could master all three only by choosing a single lightsaber after Vjun in the game.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> When asked how Korr came in possession of his first lightsaber once again when it was stated to have been lost on Vjun in the game, Kemp responded that he assumed the lightsaber was later recovered from Vjun, and he considered portraying this event in a short story.<ref name=\"Paul Kemp on TheForce.net forums\" /> According to Kemp, Korr uses the medium style of lightsaber combat throughout ''Crosscurrent''.<ref name=\"Paul Kemp style\">{{JCFcite|postnum=30869997|board=Literature|thread=Paul S.

The available options include [[Tutaminis|Force protection]], Force healing, Force absorb, [[Force drain/Legends|Force drain]], [[Force rage]], and Force choke. Those powers bear no influence on the storyline, with the exception of Kyle Katarn's comments between missions. Depending on which Force powers, light or dark, are leveled more by the player&mdash;or if they are completely even&mdash;Katarn will voice his pride or concern for Korr.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:Jedi_Academy_mission_select.png|thumb|right|250px|The mission select screen in the ''Jedi Academy'' video game]]\n''Jedi Academy'' presents the opportunity for the player to choose the order in which to do most of the missions. The game is divided into three sets of five missions, completing any four out of them, in any order, allows the player to either advance the story to crucial plot missions&mdash;Hoth, Vjun, and Taspir III&mdash;or choose to complete the final mission. Throughout the course of the missions, the number of enemies defeated by Korr is also left up to the discretion of the player, as many of them can be avoided.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> However, the official game guide presents its walkthrough in the order the missions are laid out on the mission select screen, so this article follows that order and assumes that Korr completed every available mission and defeated every single adversary.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy Guide\" /> Additionally, certain entries in the [[2008]] ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' referenced events of ''Jedi Academy'', confirming Korr's participation in the missions to Blenjeel,<ref name=\"CSWE Blenjeel\" /> Nar Kreeta,<ref name=\"CSWE Nar Kreeta\" /> Coruscant,<ref name=\"CSWE Racto\" /> and Dosuun.<ref name=\"CSWE Joris\" />\n\n===''Jedi Academy'' alternative ending===\n{{Quote|I was wrong.''\"<br />\"''No, you were weak.''\"<br />\"''Jaden, no! AHHH!|Rosh Penin and Jaden Korr, as Korr kills his former friend|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy}}\n[[File:Rosh_killed.png|thumb|left|225px|Korr kills Penin in an alternative ending.]]\n''Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy'' presents two possible endings for Korr: the light side ending,<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> confirmed to be proper in future ''Legends'' material,<ref name=\"NEC\" /> and the dark side ending. In the dark side ending, when Korr meets Rosh Penin on Taspir III, he gives in to his anger and strikes down his former friend in cold blood. After that, Alora commends Korr on killing Penin and offers him the possibility to join the Disciples of Ragnos. Korr confidently turns down the offer, claiming that the Scepter of Ragnos will belong to him alone, defeating and killing Alora.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nSoon afterward, Korr travels to Korriban to take down Axmis and with that become a true Sith Lord. On Korriban, Korr faces both Axmis's forces as well as his old fellow Jedi. He has to simultaneously fight Jedi and Dark Jedi alike, as well as stormtrooper forces, before confronting Axmis herself in the Tomb of Marka Ragnos. After Axmis is defeated for the first time, unlike the light side path, she does not try to resurrect Ragnos and lets Korr kill her.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\nAt that point, Katarn, who is after Korr, arrives in an attempt to bring Korr back to the light side. Nonetheless, Katarn fails in persuading Korr to change his mind. Korr and his former Master duel in a final fight,<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> with Katarn employing his full arsenal of lightsaber moves and Force abilities against his fallen student, proving to be a much more difficult opponent than Ragnos himself.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy Guide\" /> The fight ends with Korr using the Scepter of Ragnos to collapse the ceiling on his former Master, burying him underneath a pile of rubble. Korr then escapes through a hole in the wall made with the Scepter and flees from Korriban with his ship to the Imperial Star Destroyer orbiting Korriban, forcibly taking control of it.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n[[File:JKJAaltending.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A female Jaden Korr takes over the Imperial Star Destroyer.]]\nMeanwhile, Skywalker meets Katarn, who has managed to escape from the debris unscathed, at the Tomb of Ragnos, and they agree that they have to stop Korr from using the Scepter of Ragnos for his own needs. Katarn, distraught for losing both of his apprentices, vows to track down Korr and takes a leave of absence from the Praxeum while he does so. Skywalker, however, senses that there is still some good left in Korr and that he might still be saved. Finally, on the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of the [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ship]] with the Scepter of Ragnos in hand and the body of a dead Imperial officer lying on the floor, Korr sets a course for an unknown destination.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" />\n\n===Errors and contradictions===\nThere is a minor conflict in the description of Korr's eyes between ''Abyss'' and ''Crosscurrent''. Whereas ''Abyss'' describes Korr as having \"dark\" eyes,<ref name=\"Abyss\" /> Kemp's novels state that his eyes are gray in color, although ''Riptide'' does establish that Korr's appearances<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> post-41 ABY<ref name=\"ERC\" /> are in the Iteration's body, and the Iteration's eyes, though also gray and similar to Korr's, are different-looking.<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> The [[2012]] reference book ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'' notes that Korr's participating in the Battle of Centerpoint Station is first established in ''Crosscurrent'', and he does not appear in ''Fury'', which depicts that event.<ref name=\"ERC\" /> This is incorrect, as the character does indeed appear in the latter novel.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nThere is a lack of consistency regarding which of Korr's hands were maimed by Alpha. In ''Crosscurrent'', it was his right hand.<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> However, in ''Riptide'', his left hand is mentioned as the one with the injury.<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> Korr was slated to be featured in ''[[The Essential Characters]]'' reference book, with artwork done by artist [[Douglas Wheatley]]. The image of Korr revealed on Del Rey's Facebook page depicted him as he would appear post-''Riptide'', without the beard and missing three fingers on his hand. The image portrayed his left hand with the injury, adding to the confusion.<ref name=\"The Essential Characters preview art\">{{FacebookCite|profilelink=|url=photo.php?fbid=10151222715338713&set=a.10151222715303713.481149.67519418712&type=1&relevant_count=4|author=Star Wars Books|dateposted=2012-10-26|description=STAR WARS: THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERS preview art, Jaden Korr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310142924/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151222715338713&set=a.10151222715303713.481149.67519418712&type=1&relevant_count=4}}</ref> Regardless, the book was eventually canceled.<ref name=\"EuCantina\">{{Cite_web|url=http://eucantina.net/ EUCantina.net]|title=The Essential Characters Canceled, JJM Releases Production Notes for Kenobi|author=Devereux, William|date=2013-12-19|work=[https://web.archive.org/web/20191028225523/http://eucantina.net/ EUCantina.net]|archivedate=20191028225523}}</ref>\n\n''Riptide'' states that Korr has had a scar on his right cheek throughout most of his life,<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> while Korr's model in ''Jedi Academy'' lacks any visible scars.<ref name=\"Jedi Academy\" /> Korr's entry in ''The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia'' claims that Penin was captured by the Disciples of Ragnos near Nar Kreeta, while in fact he was captured on Byss, and it was Korr who went to Nar Kreeta. It later states that Alora killed Penin on Taspir III instead of just cutting off his arm.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|226|Korr, Jaden}}</ref>\n\nThe article ''Hoth: Under the Ice'' is written from the perspective of Katarn, presenting the events in a way as if Katarn was accompanying his apprentice during the mission, while in the game, Korr went to Hoth alone.<ref name=\"Under the Ice\" /> In ''Crosscurrent'', Korr laments distancing himself from Valin Horn, indicating some sort of relationship between the two. After the publication of the novel, when asked what their relationship was, Kemp said that he could not reveal it yet.<ref name=\"Paul Kemp Valin connection\">{{JCFcite|postnum=30740402|board=Literature|thread=Paul S.

''Riptide'' states that Korr entered the Jedi Praxeum nine years after the death of Emperor Palpatine,<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> which occurred in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]. However, the events of the ''Jedi Academy'' video game are actually dated to 14 ABY, ten years after the Emperor's death.<ref name=\"NEC palpatine death\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' places the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], while placing the events of ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'' in [[14 ABY/Legends|14 ABY]].</ref>\n\n===Ambiguous information===\n{{Quote|Is that what I think it is?

The piece greatly matched Korr's appearance<ref name=\"Wizards JA\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/JediAcademyminis|text=Jedi Academy|int=Jedi Academy (Star Wars Miniatures)|archivedate=20090918064556}}</ref> that would later be confirmed in the ''Legends'' continuity.<ref name=\"Abyss\" /> However, the figure was never identified as Korr<ref name=\"Wizards JA\" /> and, contrary to information presented in ''Crosscurrent'',<ref name=\"Crosscurrent\" /> it wielded a yellow double-bladed lightsaber.<ref name=\"Wizards JA\" />\n\nPaul S.

As they see Force lightning cracking at Korr's fingertips, the two comment that it is \"too soon\" for Korr to fall, as the leader of the Sith, [[Darth Krayt]], was not expecting Korr to fall quite yet. As a result of witnessing the recording, Nenn is dispatched on his mission to replace Korr with the Iteration.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nWhen talking about the Iteration, Wyyrlok also states that his appearance has been adjusted to that of the \"mole,\" referring to Korr. At the climax of the novel, Nenn, despite wanting revenge on Korr for his sister's death, suddenly stops and speaks some sort of a code word in a language unknown to Korr. The scene is described from Korr's point of view, and he does not recognize the code, which surprises Nenn and allows Korr to kill him. Earlier on in ''Riptide'', however, it is established that the code word is a special phrase meant to incapacitate clones, as the Umbaran uses it to subdue the Iteration at one point.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\nAt the end of the novel, Soldier also surmises that he has met a \"clone of himself\" when referring to Korr, although it is not elaborated whether this phrase means that Soldier was the original Korr or if it is simply misused to mean that he met his genetic template. However, the novels never explicitly state that Korr is a clone and leave this matter ambiguous.<ref name=\"Riptide\" /> Kemp himself has acknowledged the existence of such ambiguity in an interview, stating that it was unclear in the novels if that was really \"Jaden,\" in quotation marks, that the One Sith were after.<ref name=\"Roqoo interview\">{{Cite_web|url=https://roqoodepot.com/2011/10/25/exclusive-interview-with-riptide-author-paul-s-kemp/|title=Interview with ''Riptide'' author Paul S.

Realizing that his Master is dead, Idi-Shael transfers his memories and consciousness into the Iteration's body, something that was part of the Iteration's plan to begin with. However, the Iteration is stated to be \"not yet ready\" to receive the memories when Idi-Shael performs the procedure, and Korr's persona seemingly takes control of the clone's body. As the novel ends, although Korr seems to act the same as he has been before his death, Idi-Shael and the reader are left wondering how much of Korr is left remaining and whether the Iteration is actually still in control of the body, simply lying dormant for the time being.<ref name=\"Riptide\" />\n\n===Canceled content===\n{{Quote|I think the big reveals in RIPTIDE lend themselves to tremendous storytelling avenues for future books and I hope I get to explore them.|Paul S.
