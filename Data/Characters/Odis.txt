He was a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] displaced by the conflicts of the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and the [[Jedi Civil War]]. When [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], arrived on the moon in search of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], she spoke with Odis, who had been looking for a piloting job, and the Exile offered to help. She was able to convince the crew of the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Lunar Shadow]]'' to abandon their current [[Lunar Shadow Captain|captain]] and hire Odis.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|If I hear of anyone looking for a pilot, I'll refer them to you.''\"<br />\"''I'd greatly appreciate that.|Meetra Surik and Odis|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Odis was a veteran [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He was later displaced by both wars, becoming a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] living in the [[Refugee Sector]] of [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta's]] largest [[Moon/Legends|moon]],<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> by the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n{{GameLSmechanics}}\nWhen a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Meetra Surik]] visited the moon in her search for [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], she spoke with Odis. Odis sized up Surik, saying she looked like a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] and asked if she needed a crew. He further explained that he flew during the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] Wars and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi]] Civil War and was hoping Surik would hire him on as crew for her [[Ebon Hawk|ship]]. When Surik asked why he was no longer flying, Odis responded that he needed a pilot's license to fly [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]] on Nar Shaddaa and that they were difficult to obtain without a sponsor. Surik offered to refer to Odis anyone she encountered who was looking for a pilot. She was eventually able to convince the crew of the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Lunar Shadow]]'', who were sick of waiting for their unreliable [[Lunar Shadow Captain|captain]] to return from the [[Jekk'Jekk Tarr]], a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] on the [[Nar Shaddaa Docks]], to hire Odis as their new captain and pilot.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I don't care if you think so. I know what I've done and who I am.|Odis's response to the Exile's lack of respect for his service|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nA veteran pilot of the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, Odis was upset that, even after his service to the Republic, he was left as a refugee on Nar Shaddaa. Odis was proud of his service, though, and he did not care what anyone thought about it or himself. He was greatly appreciative of anyone willing to help him. Odis was a fair-skinned man with [[red]] hair and [[Green (disambiguation)|green]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOdis appeared in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' as a non-player character whom the player, as the Jedi Exile, may interact with. However, the player is not required to interact with Odis or find him a job to progress the main plot of the game. The game offers an alternative option to find Odis employment by convincing [[Fassa (Twi'lek)|Fassa]], the dock manager for [[Vogga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], to hire Odis. The ''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' lists this as the only outcome for Odis's quest, but since it does not result in [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] points like the ''Lunar Shadow'' outcome, this article does not consider this the [[canon]] result.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Odis#legends\n|fr=Odis\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
