For a long time, they lived in peace with the native species of the planet, the [[Galidyn]]. Eventually, however, the Fyodoi began to war amongst one another, and their destructive technology caused widespread devastation, in a war called the [[Great Cleansing]]. The Galidyn fled the conflict, hiding in their underground cities, while the Fyodoi destroyed one another. After the war ended, the surviving Humans abandoned the ruins of their once-great cities, shunned all technology completely, cut themselves off from the [[Galidyn]], who they now regarded as technology-worshiping monsters, and regressed to a primitive technological level.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Planets of the Galaxy, Volume Two]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Star Wars Planets Collection]]''\n*''[[Alien Encounters]]''\n\n[[Category:Fyodoi| ]]\n[[Category:Human races]]"}}}]}}}}
