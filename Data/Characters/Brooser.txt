At a height of 2.2 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] and weighing over 150 [[Kilogram/Legends|kilograms]], his bulk consisted of all muscle except for a [[Jargridian Brandy]] belly around his middle. Brooser was easily provoked and had a passion for fighting and [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]]. Nonetheless, he loved his girlfriend, the beautiful [[Jezzable]], above all else. However, Jezzable's flirtatious attitude toward other males aggravated Brooser's jealousy and penchant for physical violence.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Celanon/Legends|Celanon]]<ref name=\"TRP\" /> in the final [[Time/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]],<ref name=\"age\" /> Brooser was a thirty-seven-[[Standard year/Legends|year]]-old [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] during the early years of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Standing at a height of 2.2 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] and weighing over 150 [[Kilogram/Legends|kilograms]], Brooser was a large man&mdash;considerably simian in appearance&mdash;whose mass consisted of all muscle, except for a protruding belly gained from the consumption of [[Jargridian Brandy]]. Brooser garnered the most joy from fighting, reveling in the slightest provocation, with a zeal for [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] a close second. More than his vices, though, he loved his girlfriend, the beautiful and seductive [[Jezzable]].<ref name=\"TRP\" /> However, her blatantly coquettish manner with the [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] who traveled through their home of [[Celanon City]]<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|161|Jezzable}}</ref><ref name=\"PoC\">{{WEGCite|book=The Politics of Contraband|story=The Right Place ...}}</ref> drove him to the zenith of jealousy.<ref name=\"TRP\" />\n\n{{RPGseed}}\nOne afternoon, Brooser was present at [[Gularg's Libation Emporium]], a local [[Alcohol/Legends|drinking]] establishment, when he noticed that Jezzable was assiduously flirting with a newly arrived [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]]. Having decided that he didn't like the look of the smuggler, Brooser provoked a brawl, in which the other patrons soon joined. The fracas continued until [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] weapons were drawn. At that point, [[Gularg]], the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] owner of the locale&mdash;and an individual who did not condone the use of firearms in his bar&mdash;disarmed the opponents and ended the altercation.<ref name=\"PoC\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBrooser was a strong, tough working-class man who took pleasure, and was rather skilled, in [[Unarmed combat|fighting with]] his bare [[Limb/Legends|hands]]. One of the most common items that he carried with himself included [[brass knuckles]]. Brooser was easily agitated and provoked into displays of violence,<ref name=\"TRP\" /> especially by Jezzable's provocative actions toward males of all [[Species/Legends|species]].<ref>{{WEGCite|book=The Politics of Contraband|story=The Right Place ...}}, Jezzable's character sheet</ref> Some individuals found Brooser's physical appearance to be anomalous in regard to a standard Human. At one point, a [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]] named [[Jorgan Blech]] compared Brooser to a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]]. What was left of the hapless captain after Brooser was finished with him was then pummeled by a Wookiee for insulting his people.<ref name=\"TRP\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBrooser first appeared in ''[[The Right Place ...]]'', one of the five adventure scenarios written for ''[[The Politics of Contraband]]'', a [[1992]] [[West End Games]] supplement for ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]''. His scenario and character were later reprinted in ''[[Classic Adventures]]'', published in [[1995]].\n\nAlthough Brooser is a character who appears in ''The Right Place ...'' and can be approached by a player's character, it is the Gamemaster's discretion as to whether the player will participate in the mini-scenario ''Punched out!'', in which Brooser will brawl with a player. However, if it is decided that the scenario will be used, the scenario ''Flirtatious advance'', in which Jezzable flirts with the player, must be presented first, as ''Punched out!'' is the conclusion to ''Flirtatious advance''.<ref name=\"PoC\" />\n\nBrooser's character template type is given as \"Tough Native\" in ''The Politics of Contraband'',<ref name=\"TRP\" /> which is not one of the standard templates found in ''The Roleplaying Game''.<ref name=\"RPG1\">[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game (first edition)|''Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game'']]</ref><ref name=\"RPG2\">''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition]]''</ref><ref name=\"RPG2EE\">''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''</ref> Neither was the template present in ''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'', a West End Games character creation and template supplement.<ref>''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''</ref> However, as it is possible for a player to create a new template for their own individual characters, \"Tough Native\" may be used as an example template in generating a unique template or character.<ref name=\"RPG1\" /><ref name=\"RPG2\" /><ref name=\"RPG2EE\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Politics of Contraband|story=The Right Place ...}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Classic Adventures|story=The Right Place ...}} {{C|Republished}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Celanon residents]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
