During the [[Separatist Crisis]] she lent her talents to the [[Galactic Republic]]'s [[Loyalist Committee]] at the behest of Breha's [[Marriage|husband]] [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and helped execute the final design of the [[Millennial Celebration Invitation]] meant for use during the celebration of the [[Millennium|thousandth]] anniversary of the Republic's founding. The invitation was based on concepts and layouts produced by the [[artist]] [[Naveela Betuine]], but went through 250 revisions during the administration of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]], as he could not decide what he wanted the invitation to look like. Control of the design was eventually passed onto Senator [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], who decided on a final design; however, the invitation never saw distribution as the Republic [[Proclamation of the New Order|reformed]] into the [[Galactic Empire]] under Palpatine before reaching the anniversary.<ref name=\"Propaganda\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDashira Dobeq was first mentioned in the reference book ''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]'', which was written by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] and released on [[October 25]], [[2016]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dashira Dobeq#kanon\n|fr=Dashira Dobeq\n|ja=\u30c0\u30b7\u30e9\u30fb\u30c9\u30d9\u30c3\u30af\n|pl=Dashira Dobeq\n|ru=\u0414\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dobeq, Dashira}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Painters]]\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]\n[[Category:Sculptors]]"}}}]}}}}
