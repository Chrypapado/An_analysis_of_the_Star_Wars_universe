Whenever she appeared in public, she would always be accompanied by [[Tristan Pex]], her administrative aide and personal bodyguard. Tristan would later die at the hands of the [[Malkite Poisoners|Malkite Poisoner]] [[Ratambo Gale]], whom Pex believed had been attempting to assassinate Centi during a public rally. In truth, Gale had been gunning for Pex all along, but that didn't stop Centi from receiving a tremendous sympathy vote and winning reelection in a landslide victory.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[Strongholds of Resistance]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Centi, Jovive}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]"}}}]}}}}
