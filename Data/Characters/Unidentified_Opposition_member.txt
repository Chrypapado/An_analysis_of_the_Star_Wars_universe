We're artists.|The Opposition member, to Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn|audio=Oppositionpuppeteer.ogg|Master & Apprentice}}\nA [[human]] [[Gender|female]] [[puppeteer]] became a '''member''' of the [[Opposition]], a [[Politics|political]] performance troupe, during the [[Republic Era]]. While the Opposition was operating on the [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] [[planet]] [[Pijal]], the [[Pijali]] puppeteer participated in her troupe's staged performances. She and her colleagues protested the signing of the [[Governance Treaty]], a motion they felt would have detrimental effects on the citizens of [[Pijal's moon]]. At some point, the puppeteer began initiating innocuous pranks promoting her stance on the treaty, such as setting a politically messaged balloon to go off near the [[Pijali palace]].\n\nShortly after voicing its dissent, the Opposition was framed by the [[Pijali monarchy]] for several attacks on [[Czerka Arms|Czerka Corporation]] facilities that were committed by [[blackguard]]s, a secret group of Pijali [[Royal guard (Pijal)|royal guards]]. As a result, the troupe was forced into hiding on Pijal's [[moon]]. Around [[40 BBY]], she helped [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], escape from a blackguard ambush on Pijal's moon during the pair's [[Mission to Pijal|mission]] to investigate the Opposition. The puppeteer's leader, [[Halin Azucca]], held a meeting with the [[Jedi]] in a nearby [[Opposition hideout|hideout]], which she attended. She supported Azucca's claim to the Jedi that the Opposition had been framed, referencing their troupe's [[artist]]ic former occupations as proof of their innocence.\n\n==Biography==\n===Opposition's puppeteer===\n{{Quote|If you look at our work&mdash;just our true work, in isolation&mdash;it's perfectly clear that we're protesting the Governance Treaty.|Halin Azucca, on the work of the Opposition member and her colleagues|audio=OppositionTreaty.ogg|Master & Apprentice}}\nDuring the [[Republic Era]],<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> a [[human]] [[Homeworld|hailing]] from the [[Pijal's moon|moon]] of the [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] [[planet]] [[Pijal]]<ref name=\"Pijali\" /> trained as a [[puppeteer]].

She helped initiate several pranks as part of a peaceful protest, including setting a politically messaged balloon to go off near the [[Pijali palace]] in Pijal's [[Pijal capital city|capital city]]. Shortly after, members of the Opposition, including the puppeteer, were framed by the [[Pijali monarchy]] for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n===In hiding===\n{{Quote|You pulled a stunt just two days ago.

Oh, fantastic.|Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Opposition member|audio=Oppositionpuppeteer2.ogg|Master & Apprentice}}\nDue to the framing, the troupe was forced into hiding on Pijal's moon, where its members gathered evidence that the attacks blamed on the Opposition had been carried out by [[blackguard]]s, a secret division of [[Royal guard (Pijal)|royal guards]] loyal to Pijal's [[Prince]]ss [[Fanry]]. During their [[Mission to Pijal|mission]] to Pijal to investigate the Opposition, [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], were attacked by blackguards while on the planet's moon. The [[Jedi]]'s escape from their assailants was aided by members of the performance troupe, including the puppeteer. She helped escort the Jedi to a nearby [[Opposition hideout|hideout]], where Azucca informed them of the Opposition's entirely peaceful intentions.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nThe troupe leader detailed that her organization's members had been framed for the recent attacks on Czerka facilities that had been committed by blackguards. The puppeteer corroborated Azucca's claim to the Jedi, referring to the innocuous former professions of her colleagues [[Reckly]] and [[Bajjo]], and also reflecting on her own [[artist]]ic puppeteer training. She and her colleagues were happy to learn from Kenobi that the balloon prank set at the palace had gone off two [[Standard day|days]] before the Jedi's visit, which further convinced Jinn that the Opposition consisted of harmless pranksters. Azucca later gave Jinn a file containing evidence concerning the blackguards, which the puppeteer had helped collect, for use in the Jedi's investigation.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Political art.

She felt that the Governance Treaty would detrimentally affect the citizens of Pijal's moon by underrepresenting them. However, she was unwilling to hurt others to protest the motion, and instead found relish in setting innocuous pranks, one of which used a balloon. Despite the danger that came from being framed, the puppeteer opted to stay with the Opposition instead of turning herself in to Pijal's government.
