In a fit of jealousy, he murdered a rival for her affections. He exiled himself into the desert (later known as the [[Doaba Badlands]]), enduring what was later called \"the [[Long Walk]].\"\n\nBeal had a portrait painted of herself shortly afterward, in which her grief over Doaba was clearly visible. She then went into the desert in search of him, but [[Death/Legends|died]]. When Doaba found Beal's corpse, his body was consumed by his grief, leaving behind only his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and [[Jedi apparel#Traditional robes|robes]].\n\nLegend held that Doaba's guilty [[Force ghost|Force spirit]] attached itself to the portrait of Beal, called \"[[Tejha Larel]],\" [[Olys Corellisi|Old Corellian]] for \"Undying Love.\" The father of [[Pret Swain]] discovered the portrait in the ruins not far from [[Cjaalysce'I]]. The elder Pret gave it to [[Benoni Ulte]], who claimed to have seen Doaba's spirit haunting the portrait in the form of a shadow.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Black Sands of Socorro]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doaba, Iann}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Knights of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Socorrans]]"}}}]}}}}
