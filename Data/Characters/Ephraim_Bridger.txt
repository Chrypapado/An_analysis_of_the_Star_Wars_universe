They were inspired by it, Ezra. They rallied others to rise up and break out.|Ryder Azadi tells Ezra Bridger about how his parents were inspired by his message|Legacy (episode)}}\n'''Ephraim Bridger''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] revolutionary from the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[planet]] of [[Lothal]]. He and his [[Marriage|wife]], [[Mira Bridger|Mira]], spoke out against the rule of the [[Galactic Empire]] by broadcasting revolutionary messages on Lothal, actions that were supported by the planet's [[governor]], [[Ryder Azadi]]. As a result of their broadcasts, the Bridgers and Azadi were arrested and [[Prison|imprisoned]] by the Empire. This left their son, [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]], to fend for himself on Lothal for nearly a [[Standard decade|decade]]. Ezra eventually became part of a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] on Lothal and broadcasted his own [[Ezra's broadcast|message of rebellion]] to the planet's citizens. This broadcast reached the Imperial prison were Ephraim and Mira were being held, inspiring them to lead a [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|prison revolt]]. Dozens of [[prisoner]]s escaped with the Bridgers' help, but Ephraim and Mira were [[Death|killed]] during the escape.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Bridger_family.png|thumb|left|200px|The Bridger family, before Ephraim and Mira's arrests]]\nEphraim Bridger [[Marriage|married]] [[Mira Bridger]] and the two had a son, [[Ezra Bridger|Ezra]], who was born on the day that the [[Galactic Empire]] was [[Proclamation of the New Order|founded]]. After the Empire took control of their [[homeworld]] of [[Lothal]], a [[planet]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], Ephraim and Mira became revolutionaries<ref name=\"Empire Day\">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}}</ref> in [[18 BBY]]<ref name=\"The Steal\">''[[Adventures in Wild Space: The Steal]]''</ref> when they began sending out underground broadcasts that spoke out against the Empire's activities on their planet.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> They were supported by Lothal's [[governor]], [[Ryder Azadi]].<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nTheir transmissions reached [[Milo Graf|Milo]] and [[Lina Graf]] who eventually made their way to Lothal on their ship the ''[[Whisper Bird]]''. Ephraim would subsequently rescue the two as they were making their escape from the [[Broken Horn Syndicate|Twin Horn Syndicate]]. He and Mira aided them in deducing the fact that a [[bounty hunter]] named [[Shalla Mondatha|The Shade]] was after the siblings and had actually been manipulating them just earlier before. Together, they concocted a plan to get the bounty hunter off their trail which would allow the siblings to escape Lothal. Unfortunately, the plan failed and the siblings together with their pet [[Morq]] and droid [[CR-8R]] were captured and flown off. Chastised but not ready to accept defeat yet, Ephraim would contact Ryder Azadi for assistance.<ref name=\"The Steal\" />\n\nAs a result of their activities, the Empire sent [[stormtrooper]]s after Ephraim and Mira, and the soldiers took them away to be [[Prison|imprisoned]] on the charge of [[treason]];<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}</ref> Governor Azadi was also arrested for his support of their broadcasts.<ref name=\"Legacy\" /> [[Tseebo]], a [[Rodian]] on Lothal who was a close friend of Ephraim and Mira, promised to look after Ezra, but he was too afraid and failed to do so, leaving Ezra to live on his own for several [[Standard year|years]].<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\nYears later, while still in prison, Ephraim and Mira learned that Ezra had become part of a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] that fought the Empire on Lothal. He transmitted a [[Ezra's broadcast|message of rebellion]] to the people of Lothal that reached other worlds in the Outer Rim, and even made its way to the prison where the Bridgers were being held. Ephraim and Mira, who always tried to help their fellow prisoners, could tell that the voice in the broadcast was their son because of his words. They were inspired by what he said and organized a [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|prison break]]. Dozens of [[prisoner]]s, including Azadi, were able to escape with their help, but the Bridgers were separated and refused to leave until everyone else had escaped. By the time the others were free, it was too late for Ephraim and Mira&mdash;they gave their lives so others could be free.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|The Jedi teach that life doesn't cease at death, but merely changes form in the Force. Your parents are alive inside you, Ezra. They will be. Always.|Kanan Jarrus, Ezra's master|Legacy (episode)}}\nWhile Ephraim and Mira were in captivity, Ezra initially did not want to learn what happened to them, as he believed he would not have been able to survive alone on Lothal if he held out hope that they would return to him. However, he began to learn more after finding Tseebo and learning that the Rodian had volunteered his services to the [[Imperial Information Office]] in the hopes of making up for his failure to help the Bridgers. Tseebo wore a device known as the [[AJ^6 cyborg construct]] that gave him access to sensitive information, and he learned that the Bridgers had been imprisoned. Ezra did not learn about this initially,<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" /> but was later told the truth by his [[Jedi]] teacher, [[Kanan Jarrus]], and rebel [[captain]] [[Hera Syndulla]]. This truth coincided with a [[Force vision|vision]] of his parents that led him back to Lothal, which he and the rebels had previously abandoned.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n[[File:Ezra_sees_his_parents_through_the_Force.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra sees his parents through the Force]]\nOnce on Lothal, Ezra met Azadi, who returned to find Ezra and tell him what happened to his parents. Ezra was grateful to know the truth, but was nonetheless saddened by the loss of his parents. Ezra had another vision after learning of their fates, where he saw Ephraim and Mira through the Force. They told him they were proud of him and urged him to remain strong. Ezra was confused as to how he could see his parents, but Jarrus told him that Jedi philosophy taught that life did not end at death but merely transformed into something new in [[the Force]]. Ephraim and Mira would always be with him.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nIn [[0 BBY]],<ref name=\"Women of the Galaxy\">''[[Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy]]''</ref> during the [[Liberation of Lothal]], Ezra was welcomed aboard the ''[[Chimaera]]'' to talk with [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] about an offer he wanted to make. Attempting to lure the young [[Padawan]] to his trap by enter into the remains of the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]], Bridger heard the voice of Ephraim, calling him out. However, Ezra realized that it was just a lie because he sensed his parents' death and turned down Palpatine's offer before calling the [[purrgil]] to remove [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn's]] Imperial forces from Lothal.<ref name=\"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nEphraim Bridger was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] with [[Color|black]] [[hair]], blue [[eye]]s, and copper skin. He was opposed to the rule of the Galactic Empire on Lothal and spoke out against them, at the cost of his own freedom. Even while imprisoned, he and Mira continued to fight for others, up until the point that their lives were lost in ensuring other prisoners could escape from Imperial captivity.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEphraim Bridger was first heard, and pictured in a [[hologram]], in \"[[Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day]]\" and \"[[Gathering Forces]],\" episodes of the [[Star Wars Rebels Season One|first season]] of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.
