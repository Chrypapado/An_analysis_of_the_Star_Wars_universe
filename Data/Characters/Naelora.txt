The Tarasin [[Kosaa]] was her bodyguard.\n\n{{RPG}}\nDuring the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Naelora was present on Cularin in the central hut of the village where the [[Zhadorii irstat]] lived, when she was attacked by the [[heroes of Cularin]].\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn ''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]'' the identity of the Wyrd sister and bodyguard that the player characters fight in the central hut varies, depending on player level. Mid-level players fight Naelora and Kosaa, but High-Level players fight [[Torunin]] and [[Savina]] instead, while Upper-Level players face [[Baeshana]] and [[Veshin]]. It is also possible for the players to avoid the hut, so the fight against Naelora doesn't even have to take place.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]\n[[Category:Wyrd members]]"}}}]}}}}
