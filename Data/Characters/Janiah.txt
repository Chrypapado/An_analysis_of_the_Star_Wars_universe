As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' [[Cularin's disappearance|moved]] the campaign forward ten years to the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]].</ref> Academy headmaster [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]] asked her to deliver datacards to some famous heroes of [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] he needed to summon. She felt very nervous, but thrilled, at her important mission, both because it was given by the headmaster himself, and because she was familiar with the fame of the people she was to meet. She also felt a disturbance in the Force around the same time.\n\nJaniah distributed the datacards and returned to Almas in a shuttle.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAs Janiah is not essential for the plot, the Gamemaster's notes in [[A Mon Alone]] say that she can be ignored if not needed, or she can be given a twin if needed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
