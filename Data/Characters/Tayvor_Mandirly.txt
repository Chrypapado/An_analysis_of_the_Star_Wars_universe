However, after he made a stand against the practice of working people to [[Death/Legends|death]], he was murdered by [[Raxis]] and [[Nolid]], members of a local criminal organization. His body was burned and nailed to a stake and the first people to discover it were the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]].\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi found this very disturbing and suffered nightmares of it for a long time afterwards. Mandirly's sister, Bail's mother, also found his death hard to take and her grief eventually killed her. However, Raxis and Nolid were only fined by the local government for the murder.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Clone Wars: Wild Space]]'' {{1stm|[[The Clone Wars: Wild Space (audiobook)|''The Clone Wars: Wild Space'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[The Clone Wars: Wild Space (audiobook)|''The Clone Wars: Wild Space'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tayvor Mandirly\n|fr=Tayvor Mandirly\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mandirly, Tayvor}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
