Through several interviews with Zuckuss, she discovered that the [[Gand/Legends|Gand]] had a severe case of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]]. At the end of her diagnosis, she remarked that Zuckuss was dangerous to himself and others. Karastee's analysis gave little hope that Zuckuss would be released from the facility&mdash;at least willingly. Karastee's report was eventually compiled in a [[The Essential Guide to Alien Species|guide]] to the [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Species/Legends|species]] of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].\n\n==Sources==\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*{{FFCite|61|BOU15-16, ''Bounty Hunters - Zuckuss''}} {{Imo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karastee, Gawynn}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Medical professionals]]"}}}]}}}}
