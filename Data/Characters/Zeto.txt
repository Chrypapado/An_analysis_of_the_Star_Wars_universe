Zeto was increasingly frustrated by the five consecutive wins by racer [[Dooarix Gyll]] and hired [[Tal Feint]], a [[Muun/Legends|Muun]] investigator to discover if they were cheating. When Feint pointed out that Gyll was using his companion [[Lisali Mitillan]] as a spotter, Zeto and his thugs confronted the pair and threatened them with a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]]. Mitillan used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to throw Zeto against a wall, knocking him unconscious. Geist used his own [[Mind trick/Legends|power of persuasion]] to send Zeto's hired hands running, though they dragged Zeto out of the garage without prompting.<ref name=\"EV\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Endless Vigil]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
