She was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Valarian/Legends|Valarian]].\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Shiri'ani was taken to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] by [[Slaver/Legends|slavers]] and sold to [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna]] as a child. But the chaos following [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] death meant she never actually remained his property for long. Shiri'ani became a street urchin, and tried to accumulate enough credits through begging to pay for a ticket back to her homeworld.\n\nAs a young adult, she became a dancer for Lady [[Valarian/Legends|Valarian]] at the ''[[Lucky Despot]]''. Valarian hoped that the Twi'lek knew something about Jabba's treasure vaults, though this turned out to be an error. Regardless, Shiri'ari's acumen, ambition and psychological skills made her a valued employee. She was promoted to bartender, and then to assistant manager.\n\nWhen Shiri'ari reached her majority, it was apparent to all of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] that she was going to inherit Valarian's criminal empire. She purchased the future [[Lucky Star (Mos Entha)|''Lucky Star'']], deliberately modeling her new establishment on Valarian's. Valarian gave her assistant financial backing and muscle so she could get started.\n\nShiri'ani by this time had established a large number of potential suitors, most of whom she kept just at arms length, finding it profitable to attract and manipulate a variety of humanoid males.\n\nShiri'ani did not realize that her newest lover and investment, the Twi'lek [[Firith Olan]], was none other than her hated former owner, Bib Fortuna, who had schemed to transfer his brain into one of his enemies. Olan/Fortuna began to be more influential in her life than her mentor, and it would be soon that Shiri'ani and Valarian would no longer be allies.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Shiri'ani\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
