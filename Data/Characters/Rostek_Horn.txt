Although Corran grew up thinking Rostek was his biological grandfather, he found out as an adult that Rostek was a friend of his real grandfather, [[Nejaa Halcyon]]. The two became partners in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], and last saw each other when Nejaa was called away in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Rostek fought in several minor battles near [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], alongside Jedi. Nejaa died near the end of the war. Nejaa's widow [[Scerra Horn|Scerra]] married Rostek, and he adopted her son, [[Hal Horn|Valin]], who later became the father of Corran. He had a long and respected tenure in the Corellian Security Force, reaching the rank of Director before retiring. He was also a renowned horticulturist who was famous for his flower hybrids.\n\nRostek Horn was reportedly a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] sympathizer during the [[Great Jedi Purge]] and the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. He used his experience in [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] to assist them in hiding from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. He would store the locations of where he helped them hide in the genetic codes of his flowers-on one occasion he gave one of the Empire's Jedi hunters some such flowers as stock for his garden on Coruscant. Rostek also frequented the [[Raging Ronto]], a popular [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. The owner of the Raging Ronto was reputedly a good friend of Rostek, and himself was an infamous Rebel sympathizer. It was rumored that when the owner of this establishment went into hiding from the Empire in [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], Rostek assisted him and his family in disappearing.\n\n[[Tosruk]] worked for him in [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]].\n\nRostek was still alive as of [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]], when he kept up a correspondence with [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] biologists due to his occupation in horticulture.<ref name=\"DT2\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref> In [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]], he arranged for [[Tahiri Veila]] to give a \"know-your-enemy\" briefing on the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] to CorSec personnel.<ref name=\"EGW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|66|Elusion Illusion}}\n*''[[Interlude at Darkknell]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Side Trip]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' {{Mo}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rostek Horn\n|hu=Rostek Horn\n|pl=Rostek Horn\n|fi=Rostek Horn\n|ru=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043a \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horn, Rostek}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
