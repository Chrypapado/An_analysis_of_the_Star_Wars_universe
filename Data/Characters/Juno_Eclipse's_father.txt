Traitors, all of them.|Juno Eclipse's father, describing the Jedi Order from his point of view|The Force Unleashed (novel)}}\nThe '''father''' of [[Juno Eclipse]] was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who lived during the final [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] and into the [[Imperial Period|era]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. A staunch supporter of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] and a firm believer in the tenets of the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], he instilled his values into his daughter, [[Juno Eclipse]]. However, as a result of their dysfunctional relationship, the younger Eclipse promptly left her [[Homeworld/Legends|home]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]] after joining the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], effectively severing ties between daughter and [[Parent/Legends|father]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|What did they do?''\"<br />\"''What did they ''do''? The Jedi filth betrayed Palpatine&mdash;that's all they did.|Juno Eclipse and her father|The Force Unleashed (novel)}}\n[[File:JunoEclipseHS.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Captain Juno Eclipse, daughter of a civilian engineer]]\nThe [[Parent/Legends|father]] of [[Juno Eclipse]], a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] married to a [[Juno Eclipse's mother|woman]] of the same [[Species/Legends|species]], lived around the time of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic's]] [[Declaration of a New Order|transformation]] into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]. Shortly after the start of the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] gave birth to their daughter and only child, Juno Eclipse, on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. According to [[Imperial records]], Eclipse's mother was [[Death/Legends|killed]] after being in a firefight between [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] and insurgents on Corulag. Thus, her widower was left to raise their daughter, although he would have preferred to serve in the [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial Military]] instead. His failure to pass the physical exam, however, barred him from gaining entry into the [[Corulag Academy|Imperial Academy]]. Forced to remain as a civilian [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]], Eclipse's father became a bitter and resentful man who, because of his frustrations, became increasingly cold and distant to his daughter.<ref name=\"TFUn\" />\n\nWhile still living on Corulag, Eclipse and her father relocated to a new home, which contained an illegal [[Hologram/Legends|holo]] of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] armed with [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]]. Upon discovering the holo, the father showed its content to her before erasing it. Due to his loyalty to [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], he regarded the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] with hatred and disgust; its members were [[Order 66/Legends|branded]] as traitors for their [[Showdown on Coruscant|alleged assassination attempt]] on Palpatine's life shortly before the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].<ref name=\"TFUn\" />\n\nAt the age of 14, Eclipse was admitted into the Academy as the youngest [[Cadet/Legends|cadet]] to ever gain entry. Given that her father was a fierce admirer of anyone who enlisted into the service of the Empire, she hoped that her own loyalty and dedication to the New Order would meet with his approval. Her actions had an obstinate effect, however. The daughter ultimately achieved everything her father had ever wanted, and on the day when she completed her time at the Academy as an honor student, her father failed to attend the graduation ceremony. After accepting the fact that her father would never give his approval to her, Eclipse departed from her homeworld to serve in the ranks of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. By then, the feelings of loathing and resentment were mutually shared between father and daughter, and thus contact between the two had ceased immediately after Eclipse left Corulag. No longer caring for her father, she went on to build a successful career as an [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]] and [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE]] [[TIE pilot|pilot]], partly to spite him by becoming all that he could never be.<ref name=\"TFUn\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What rubbish do your teachers fill your head with if you don't even know that?|Juno Eclipse's father, berating her|The Force Unleashed (novel)}}\nThe Human father of Juno Eclipse was cold and distant, particularly toward his daughter.<ref name=\"TFUdb\">[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'' in-game databank]]</ref> Following the death of his wife, he blamed \"insurgents\" for his family's loss, and thus came to hate all enemies of the Galactic Empire. His support for Emperor Palpatine also caused him to develop an extreme hatred for the members of the Jedi Order who, from his point of view, were all traitors for attempting to overthrow Palpatine.<ref name=\"TFUn\" /> His adherence to the ideals of the New Order extended to its [[Human High Culture|Humancentric policy]]; he strongly disapproved of his daughter's fascination with [[Alien/Legends|alien]] cultures, unlike his late wife who encouraged Eclipse's interest.<ref name=\"TFUdb\" />\n\nThough Juno Eclipse longed for her father's approval, he refused to give it to her.<ref name=\"TFUdb\" /> An angry and ill-tempered man, he often directed his repressed feelings of frustration and resentment at his daughter through mostly verbal abuse.
