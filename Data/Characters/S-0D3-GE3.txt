The [[Droid/Legends|droid]] was owned by a [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] named [[Bahima]]&mdash;the [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] of the [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|cantina]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]]&mdash;and was used as a [[Waiter/Legends|waiter]] for the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]]. S-0D3-GE3 discovered the corpse of the [[Death/Legends|murdered]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sullio]] shortly after the incident and was destroyed by [[Sullio's murderer]] moments after his discovery. [[Meetra Surik]], an [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], discovered S-0D3-GE3's head while investigating the murder of Sullio in hopes of clearing [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Dhagon Ghent]] of the crime. With the help of a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] patron of the cantina named [[Kiph]], Surik was able to extract a recording of the droid's last moments from its [[Memory core|memory banks]], which she used to prove Ghent's innocence.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|That's the third serving droid I've had this month.

Meanwhile, S-0D3's ruined body was left at the crime scene and picked over by [[Scavenger/Legends|scavengers]], who sold some of the parts to [[1B-8D-GE3]]. 1B-8D, a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] owned by local [[Merchant/Legends|merchant]] [[Tolas]], traded used droids and droid parts, and readily purchased S-0D3's components as he lacked the ability to comprehend or care whether he bought stolen goods.
