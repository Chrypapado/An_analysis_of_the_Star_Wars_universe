The ''Outbound Flight'' Project aimed to colonize [[extra-galactic]] [[Realspace/Legends|space]], and to discover Force-sensitive [[Species/Legends|species]] beyond the borders of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] from whom new Jedi could be trained. Because of the Project's goals, and because secondaries were likely to have Jedi children, Jedi Master [[Justyn Ma'Ning]] and [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Lorana Jinzler]] invited secondaries and their families to the reception as well, much to C'baoth's chagrin. Ma'Ning and Jinzler, C'baoth's former [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], wanted to prepare the secondaries for the likely event that their families may produce Jedi descendants in the future, but C'baoth preferred to deal with that possibility if and when it happened.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n[[Dillian Pressor]] was a secondary, and his son [[Jorad Pressor]] wished to become a Jedi.<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSecondaries appeared in [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[2006]] novel [[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']].<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight residents]]\n[[Category:Titles]]"}}}]}}}}
