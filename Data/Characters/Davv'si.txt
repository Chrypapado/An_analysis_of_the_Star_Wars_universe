[[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], members of the [[Believers]] [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]] began poisoning [[kaluthin]] plants on Almas and shortly after the poisoning of a [[Farm/Legends|farm]] owned by [[Rashen Sotose]], Davv'si and a number of other Almas farmers sighted some unidentified [[Airspeeder/Legends|airspeeders]] moving about. Because of the incident at Sotose's farm, Davv'si and the other farmers decided not to take any chances, so they pulled all of their [[harvester]]s into a tight circle and waited in the middle, with their [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]] at the ready. The [[Heroes of Cularin]], who were investigating the poisoning of the Kaluthin, approached the group of farmers, and Davv'si informed them of the speeders that the farmers had seen.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Kaluthin Are Always Greener]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Herglics]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]"}}}]}}}}
