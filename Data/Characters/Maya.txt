Shortly after the [[Declaration of a New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Organa sent her on a mission to recover cargo essential for weakening the Empire.\n\n==Biography==\nMaya, a native from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], worked for the [[Alderaanian Security]] for a few months after the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Following the [[Declaration of a New Order|declaration]] of the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], she was sent, along with [[Sirona Okeefe]] on a mission to [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] aboard the [[Banshee (Baudo-class)|''Banshee'']]. On [[Sel Zonn Station]] in orbit above [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal]], Maya encountered Imperial resistance and was badly wounded during a skirmish. She asked a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] to fight off the Imperials pursuing her. Maya further convinced the spacers to help her retrieve Organa's cargo - an Alderaanian Security agent frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe spacers that assisted Maya are actually roleplayer-controlled characters in ''[[The Traitor's Gambit]]'', the first adventure in the ''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'' campaign, produced by [[Wizards of the Coast]] to supplement the [[Saga Edition|''Star Wars Roleplaying Game, Saga Edition'']]. The roleplayers can successfully complete Maya's mission even if she dies during the skirmish, meaning that her [[canon]]ical fate is unknown.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=The Traitor's Gambit|int=The Traitor's Gambit|archivedate=20100118064618}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Maya\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanian Resistance members]]\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
