While on Coruscant, Cavin worked for [[Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren]], Cularin sector's representative in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] and on the [[Gadrin]] [[Spaceport/Legends|starport]] project. He and [[Dexx Molay]] ran the [[Syndicate]]. The two desired to gather as much power and wealth around them as possible and arranged for expertly forged documents to fall into [[Westa Impeveri|Imperveri's]] hands, documents that showed a strong financial relationship between Barnab Chistor and the [[Metatheran Cartel]]. While these false documents would not stand up to a thorough investigation, they would be good enough to cause Governor Chistor trouble. The pair planed to control a large percentage of trade entering and leaving Gadrin when the port was finished.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Halves]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Holes]]''\n*''[[Peaces]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
