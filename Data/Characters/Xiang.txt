A student of [[Je'daii Master]] [[Lanoree Brock's father|Brock]], Xiang would eventually go on to serve as an instructor under Brock's leadership at [[Bodhi]] Temple. During the [[Stargazer Uprising]], [[Je'daii Temple Master]] [[Lha-Mi]] arranged a meeting with [[Je'daii Ranger]] [[Lanoree Brock]] aboard his [[Peacemaker-class cruiser|''Peacemaker''-class cruiser]] in a remote field thirty [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]] south of [[Akar Kesh]]. Xiang was invited to attend alongside Masters [[Dam-Powl]], [[Tem Madog]], a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]], and one other. Lha-Mi had arranged the secretive meeting to discuss the growing problem of Dalien Brock's [[Stargazers (sect)|Stargazer cult]]. Xiang explained to Brock that she had been chosen because of her involvement in the [[Hang Layden]] accords on [[Kalimahr]], a successful mission to [[Nox]], and her elimination of the leader of  Wookiee dissidents on [[Ska Gora]], [[Gharcanna]]; but also because of the fact that Dalien and Lanoree were siblings. Brock and his cult desired to leave the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]] and planned to do so by activating a [[hypergate]] rumored to be located deep within the heart of the [[Old City (Tython)|Old City]] far out in the [[Red Desert]] on the continent of [[Talss]]. Xiang and the others were fearful that Brock intended to construct a [[Gree device|device]] using the ancient [[Gree technology|technology]] of the [[Gree/Legends|Gree]] to create [[Dark matter/Legends|dark matter]] that was theorized to be capable of ripping open a [[Black hole/Legends|black hole]] if activated on Tython, and potentially destroy the entire system. Hoping to avoid panic by sending a larger group to find and detain Brock or worse, lead more people to support his cause, the Masters agreed a single Ranger would make for a better outcome.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]'' {{1st|[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Xiang\n|ru=\u041a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0433\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Je'daii Masters]]\n[[Category:Sith species]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
