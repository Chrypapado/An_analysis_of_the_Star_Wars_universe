I just race. Don't know about anything else.|Nico to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Nico Senvi''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] green [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]]. He was one of the [[Swooper/Legends|swoop racers]] that [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] met in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] [[3956 BBY]] and the local favorite. Nico was a skilled [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] pilot, ready to tackle the intergalactic circuit. He was offered a contract by [[Motta]] that would allow him to race as a pro, but declined since the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] would collect most of his winnings.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe problem regarding Nico's contract with Motta is a sidequest on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. The player can either help Nico get a better contract ([[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] choice), or force him into taking the current contract ([[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]). Because the [[canon]] storyline features a light-side [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], it can be believed that Revan helped Nico get a better contract.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nico Senvi\n|pl=Nico Senvi\n|ru=\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e \u0421\u0435\u043d\u0432\u0438\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Senvi, Nico}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
