I need the services of somebody willing to deliver a highly important message. Will you do it?|Aaph Koden, to a Rebel subordinate|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Aaph Koden''' was a [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who was an [[Alliance Army/Legends|Army]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] and [[Blaster carbine/Legends|carbineer]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. She operated out of the [[City/Legends|town]] of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. By the [[Time/Legends|time]] following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Koden learned of a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] woman named [[Talia Reede]]. Eager to protect Reede from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Koden depended on a fellow Rebel to safeguard the Force-sensitive and bring her back to Anchorhead to begin her [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I can't entrust this mission to just anybody. The Empire has discovered that Talia Reede is Force-sensitive. I need you to stop them from killing her. What do you say?\"<br />\"If she can use the Force, why can't she protect herself?\"<br />\"She hasn't been trained to use the Force, she just has the potential. Will you help her?|Aaph Koden and a fellow Rebel|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAaph Koden was an [[Alliance Army/Legends|Army]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]]<ref name=\"SWG\" /> and [[Blaster carbine/Legends|carbineer]]<ref name=\"Total\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] who was stationed in the [[City/Legends|town]] of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> where she lived as a townsperson.<ref name=\"Prima\" /> By the [[Time/Legends|time]] following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Koden and her fellow Rebels discovered the existence of a potential [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] woman named [[Talia Reede]]. Because the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] treated such [[The Force/Legends|Force-users]] as fugitives, Koden deemed it prudent to deliver a message to Reede in the form of a [[Datacard/Legends|datadisc]], warning her of her potential power, and urging her to reach out to the Rebellion to pursue [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nLieutenant Koden enlisted the aid of a fellow Rebel to deliver the message to Reede just outside of town. Although Reede was skeptical of her potential Force-sensitivity, she agreed to consider the Alliance's offer. Koden soon learned that the Empire had also discovered Reede's Force potential, and that they had dispatched Imperial [[Trooper/Legends|troops]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]] her. However, Reede was not trained in the Force and only had the potential to use it. Fearing for Reede's life, Koden employed the fellow Rebel who had aided her earlier with protecting Reede from the Imperial [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nAn Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] [[Commander/Legends|commander]] and two other stormtroopers scoured the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] around town, but before they could locate Reede, the Rebel sent by Koden confronted them and killed them in an ensuing [[Lightfight|firefight]]. With the threat seemingly eliminated, Koden instructed the Rebel to find Reede and bring her safely back to Anchorhead. However, as soon as the Rebel approached Reede, the two of them were suddenly ambushed by three Imperial [[Desert stormtrooper|sandtroopers]]. Committed to protecting the helpless Force-sensitive, the Rebel successfully managed to kill them, and escorted Reede back to Koden in Anchorhead. The lieutenant was pleased to see Reede safely returned, and she commended her fellow compatriot for saving the life of a potential [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|There are few individuals I trust as much I've come to trust you.

However, Koden was capable of developing a certain level of trust in others when needed.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nSuch was the case with the Rebel subordinate who she had entrusted with rescuing Reede. To Koden, this particular Rebel operative was one of the few people she could trust, and she commended the individual for being both courageous and adaptable. Koden was an upbeat individual, but if someone were to decline a task assigned by her, she would be quick to express her disappointment by accusing such people as being uncourageous.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|Excellent!
