Circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], a [[Heroes of Cularin|group]] of freelance agents spoke to Tyger during the course of an investigation to locate the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Selima DeWitt]], an acquaintance of the Wookiee.\n\n==Biography==\nTyger was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who lived during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]], where he owned and operated the nightclub [[Tyger Burning Bright]] in the [[platform city]] [[Bayonard]]. He was an acquaintance of the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Selima DeWitt]], the daughter of [[Davin DeWitt]], Bayonard's [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]], and Selima often visited Tyger in his club, or elsewhere if the club was not open.<ref name=\"Find the Lady\" />\n\nCirca [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is placed in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. Therefore, ''[[Find the Lady]]'' can be dated to circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]].</ref> Selima joined the [[Bark Lovers' Alliance]], a Cularin-based environmental group, and left Bayonard to establish a [[Natural|shop]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Gadrin]] with her boyfriend, [[Percival Vale]], and the [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] [[Higgie Sethven]]. However, she did not tell her [[Parent/Legends|father]] where she was going, and he eventually hired the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents who operated in the [[Cularin system]], to find her. Davin provided the agents with a list of Selima's known contacts, which included Tyger, and, during the course of their investigation, the agents traveled to Tyger's club to ask the Wookiee about Selima. Tyger told them that he had heard that Selima had joined the Bark Lovers' Alliance and was living in Gadrin. The agents subsequently traveled to Gadrin and located Selima.<ref name=\"Find the Lady\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTyger was fond of Selima DeWitt, and he was worried when she disappeared and joined the Bark Lovers' Alliance. While he wanted to help look for her, he was unable to do so because he had to run his nightclub. He had [[Gold/Legends|gold]]-[[Color/Legends|colored]] hair.<ref name=\"Find the Lady\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTyger was created by [[Megan Robertson]] and appeared in the [[2001]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] adventure ''[[Find the Lady]]'', a supplement that formed part of the [[Trade War trilogy]] of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign. In the adventure, the player-characters [[Roleplaying game|roleplay]] as the Heroes of Cularin, and, if they travel to Tyger's club when it is not open, they knock on the door and Tyger answers it personally. If the players later inform Tyger of any of their findings in their search for Selima, he is very grateful to them.<ref name=\"Find the Lady\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Find the Lady]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
