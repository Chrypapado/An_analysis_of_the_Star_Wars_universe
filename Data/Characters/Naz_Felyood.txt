Before winning the game and promptly disappearing, the woman informed Felyood that he would one day visit the world of [[Korriban]], a place where \"evil lives\" and discover a most valuable treasure.\n\nThis event lay almost forgotten within Felyood's mind, until a botched escape from an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] patrol landed him on the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] tomb world. Eventually he set out on an expedition into a nearby [[Valley of Golg|valley]], which, through a misstep, landed him in the tomb of the ancient [[Sith Overlord|Sith King]] [[Dathka Graush]].\n\nIn the tomb, Felyood discovered Graush's sarcophagus and an assortment of artifacts: a [[Sith sword]], a [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocron]], an amulet, and the Force-strong [[Heart of Graush]]. Upon Felyood's discovery of these things, he was possessed by the long dead Sith Lord, allowing his [[Korriban zombie|undead]] army to reawaken.\n\nDuring an assault on the still downed ''Jynni's Virtue'', Felyood ended up losing the Heart. Suffering greatly at the loss of his friends, he wrote a [[Last words of Captain Naz Felyood|letter]] confessing his feelings for First Mate Luroon. He also included a warning that ordered anyone who found the letter to leave Korriban while they still had the chance.\n\nThe rest of Felyood's days were spent wandering the Korriban wastes, looking for the lost Heart. The residue of Gaush's spirit left within him prevented him aging any further, dooming him to search forever. He aptly presented himself, to any poor souls unfortunate enough to land on Korriban, as the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and solicited their help in finding the lost Heart.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAs Felyood was created for an RPG adventure, his ultimate fate is presumably left up to the players involved. As such, there is unlikely to be an official canon resolution to his tale.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031002korriban|text=Korriban: Planet of Lost Souls|int=Korriban: Planet of Lost Souls|archivedate=20100221224446}} {{1st}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Naz Felyood\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Felyood, Naz}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]"}}}]}}}}
