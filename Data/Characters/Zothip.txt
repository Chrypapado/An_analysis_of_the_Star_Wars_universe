He had no compunctions about spacing part of a [[Starship/Legends|starship]] crew to compel the rest to cooperate with his raiding parties, and was considered by some to be the \"scourge of the [[Amorris system]].\" When [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] put out the word among fringe groups that the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] would pay well for [[Warship/Legends|warships]], [[Niles Ferrier]] tried to answer this call by stealing ships from the [[New Republic Defense Fleet/Legends|New Republic Defense Fleet]] at the [[Sluis Van/Legends|Sluis Van]] shipyard. He was deflected from this course of action by [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], who suggested that Ferrier try his luck at the Cavrilhu Pirates' base on [[Amorris]]. Ferrier successfully stole three [[Sienar Fleet Systems/Legends|Sienar]] patrol ships from the pirates, and Zothip swore revenge on Ferrier and his entire crew. Zothip never got the chance to exact vengeance upon Ferrier, however, as the [[Smugglers' Alliance]] soon killed Ferrier for betraying them.\n\nIn [[16 ABY/Legends|16 ABY]], the Cavrilhu Pirates committed an attack against the people of [[Lorardian]]. This earned the wrath of the [[Mistryl Shadow Guard|Mistryl]], and would ultimately lead to Zothip's demise.\n\nImmediately prior to and during the Caamas Document crisis, Zothip was involved in an under-the-table deal with [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Vilim Disra]] of the [[Imperial Remnant]]. Zothip's gang was loaned some of the few remaining [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|Mount Tantiss]] [[Cloning/Legends|clones]] from Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic ten years earlier, and in return, the Imperial Remnant was supplied with [[Preybird-class starfighter|''Preybird''-class starfighters]] from the Cavrilhu Pirates' production lines. The Imperial Remnant's territory had been vastly reduced following Grand Admiral Thrawn's death, and the production of the Empire's traditional [[TIE Series]] fighters had been consequently reduced to a trickle. The ''Preybirds'' were badly needed, and they proved to be adequate substitutes for TIE fighters, though they lacked the automatic association with Imperial power that TIEs evoked in most sentients. In addition to this exchange, the Imperial Remnant supplied the Cavrilhu Pirates with locations of New Republic shipping convoys. Both parties reaped the benefits: Zothip's gang kept whatever loot it found aboard the ships, and the Remnant happily watched as the New Republic's shipping endeavors were destabilized.\n\nHowever, this deal between Zothip and Disra proved to be troublesome for them both. After defending an [[Ishori]] shipping convoy from a group of Cavrilhu pirates, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] investigated and eventually located one of the Cavrilhu gang's bases in the [[Kauron]] asteroid field. Skywalker was captured and briefly interrogated by Zothip, but he quickly escaped, narrowly avoiding an explosion triggered by the base's self-destruct system, which Zothip had activated as he fled.\n\nInitially furious at Disra for allowing this to happen, Zothip agreed to one more job for the conniving moff, with the promise of the greatest reward yet. Disra asked Zothip to attack the [[Chimaera/Legends|''Chimaera'']] with ships falsely bearing [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] insignia, in hopes that [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]] would believe that [[Garm Bel Iblis]] had rejected his peace envoy. Pellaeon easily routed Zothip's force, and Zothip, having lost more of his assets, went to [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] to confront Disra. On the Imperial capital, Zothip sneaked into Disra's private office using a secret entrance and called Disra from the moff's own desk. [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Grodin Tierce]], part of a secret triumvirate formed by Disra, suggested that they intimidate Zothip with their \"Grand Admiral Thrawn\" scam. The con man [[Flim]], completely dressed and acting the part, put on a compelling show for Zothip. However, Zothip was unconvinced, and signaled for his men to attack the Imperial conspirators.\n\nMajor Tierce acted before Zothip's guards could fire a shot, and Tierce was joined by [[Karoly D'ulin]], a Mistryl Shadow Guard who had also sneaked into the secret office and had been hiding outside of the room. After D'ulin and Tierce eliminated the pirates who had accompanied Zothip, Tierce took Zothip down with a kick to the stomach, and D'ulin ended his life with a knife to the back. As he died, D'ulin grabbed Zothip by his beard and made sure he knew that his death was punishment for the slaughter on Lorardian.\n\nAfter Zothip's death, a pirate known by the name [[Control]] took over as head of the Cavrilhu Pirates.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]''\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Pirates & Privateers]]''\n\n[[Category:Bestinians]]\n[[Category:Cavrilhu Pirates]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
