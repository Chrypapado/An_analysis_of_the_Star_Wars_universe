He was assigned to level 120, just above the wild and raucous [[Port Town (Cloud City)/Legends|Port Town]]. By the time [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] had won the rights to the title of [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]], Blendin gained the rank of captain and had become a corrupt Guard known for his use of intimidation to secure peace. He readily accepted bribes and was on the payroll of several minor criminals. He commanded his men to never go too far or take too much and draw attention to themselves.<ref name=\"CCL\" /> In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Jerrol Blendin was one of the two Wing Guards who accompanied Lando when he went to visit several prisoners such as [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Jerrol Blendin first appeared in the first edition of the [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]] sourcebook ''[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' as an example of a standard Bespin guard, and was only given roleplaying stats. The [[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back (Second Edition)|second edition]] of the sourcebook included a full profile of Blendin as part of a major expansion by [[Pablo Hidalgo]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/fiction/f20080522/index.html|text=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|int=Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-lando-calrissian-idiots-array.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 43|''Star Wars'' (1977) 43]]\n*''[[Star Wars Manga: The Empire Strikes Back 3]]''\n*''[[The Empire Strikes Back: A Storybook]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (PhotoComic)]]'' {{Po}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Jerrol Blendin}}\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' {{1stID}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back'', Second Edition]]\n*{{CCG|set=Cloud City Limited|link=CloudCity-Dark/large/trooperjerrolblendin.gif|cardname=Trooper Jerrol Blendin}}\n*{{InsiderCite|49|Who's the Bossk?!}}\n*{{TCG|set=The Empire Strikes Back (TCG)|link=http://wizards.com/swtcg/images/esb/lando_calrissian_(c).jpg|cardname=Lando Calrissian}} {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=The Price of Victory|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Price_of_Victory#Card_gallery|cardname=Jerrol Blendin}}\n*{{InsiderCite|148|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: The Cloud City Wing Guards}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jerrol Blendin\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u043b \u0411\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bespin Wing Guards]]\n[[Category:Bespinites|Blendin, Jerrol]]\n[[Category:Humans|Blendin, Jerrol]]\n[[Category:Males|Blendin, Jerrol]]"}}}]}}}}
