Under the Republic, her shop had catered to mostly wealthy clients of the city of [[Ussa]]. However, after the Empire took over the planet she fell on hard times and agreed to take in Imperial sewing jobs. This alienated her Bellassan customers who thereafter boycotted the shop, and though it remained empty most days, Mariana was working through the night sewing and tailoring uniforms for the local Imperial garrison and prison.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: The Desperate Mission]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mariana\n|ja=\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\u30ca\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bellassans]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
