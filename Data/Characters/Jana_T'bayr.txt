Her mate however, we could design to be almost entirely devoted to combat.|Jana T'bayr, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Jana T'bayr worked for the [[GeneTech Syndicate]] in a [[GeneTech Syndicate Lab|laboratory]] located outside the city of [[Dearic]].<ref name=\"SWG:AB\" /> The lab was listed towards Talusian authorities as engaging in legitimate genetic manipulation on animals.<ref name=\"SWG:G\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Genocide|Talus}}</ref> In fact, Jana T'bayr was involved in the the [[Parasophic Arachne]] program,<ref name=\"SWG:AB\" /> an illegal and dangerous [[Bioengineering/Legends|bioengineering]] project conducted by the GeneTech Syndicate. The objective of the program was to create an intelligent and powerful form of [[arachne]]s for the use of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"SWG:G\" /> The project was led by [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Vigh]], the [[Chief Scientist|chief scientist]] of the GeneTech Syndicate.<ref name=\"GP\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=66911&resource=features|text=Genetic Potential|archivedate=20061119061852}}</ref> The Parasophic Arachne program could be considered as a success since the GeneTech Syndicate scientists eventually managed to create deadly and intelligent creatures.<ref name=\"SWG:GD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Grim Discovery|Talus}}</ref> Jana T'bayr was involved in the development of the queen's mate, the largest and strongest arachne of the Parasophic Arachne program.<ref name=\"SWG:AB\" />\n\n[[File:AdaptiveBiology-GH.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Spacers discovering the queen's mate.]]\nHowever, circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the bioengineered arachnes had become so smart and ferocious that they finally managed to overwhelm their creators and slaughtered most of the staff of the lab. All the surviving scientists quickly fled to avoid being arrested and charged with illegal biological experiments.<ref name=\"SWG:G\" /> Jana T'bayr was the sole scientist to stay behind and remain in the lab. She initially wanted to save the project but she then realized that she had to find a way to prevent the parasophic arachnes from destroying the planet Talus.<ref name=\"SWG:AB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Adaptive Biology|Talus}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] finally became aware of what was happening in the GeneTech Syndicate Lab, [[Agent/Legends|Agent]] [[Taarna]] dispatched a CorSec crew to clean the lab. The CorSec targeted the arachne queen, the arachne responsible for breeding the parasophic arachnes,<ref name=\"SWG:G\" /> and the arachne [[Egg/Legends|eggs]] in order to prevent the spread of the species.<ref name=\"SWG:FtS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Find the Source|Talus}}</ref> The CorSec forces also met Jana T'bayr who warned them about the queen's mate. This powerful arachne, entirely devoted to combat, was designed with adaptive biology. If the queen's mate was the only arachne left, he could morph into a breeder and could repopulate the species by himself. A group of spacers therefore found the creature the lab and, after an intense fight, managed to kill the dreadful creature.<ref name=\"SWG:AB\" /> The CorSec thought that the destruction of all the breeding arachnes and eggs definitively eliminated the Parasophic Arachne threat.<ref name=\"SWG:G\" /> However, Jana T'bayr had managed to save a brood egg from the arachne queen. This egg was still alive but dormant, with the potential to restart the entire project. The scientist eventually gave the egg to one of the spacers who destroyed the queen's mate because she did not want neither to keep it nor to destroy it.<ref name=\"SWG:AB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJana T'bayr was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:AB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Jana T'bayr was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Genocide|Deifying Decisions]]\" arc with the release of \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 2|Chapter 2: The Talus Incident]]\", on [[August 1]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Galactic Hunters|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Adaptive_Biology_(card).JPG|cardname=Adaptive Biology}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Jana T'bayr}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:T'bayr, Jana}}\n[[Category:Biologists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Talusians]]"}}}]}}}}
