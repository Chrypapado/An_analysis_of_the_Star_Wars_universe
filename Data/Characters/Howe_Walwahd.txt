Besides, she lost a leg in the accident and used an artificial replacement since.\n\nNeeding a new job, Walwahd became a dockmaster in [[Bartyn's Landing]], reluctantly working for the same [[Guther Bartyn]] who owned Bartyn Gourmet Delicacies. She disliked that surname and was rude with anyone working for Bartyn &mdash; which meant almost everyone. Nonetheless, she methodically reported anything of importance during her guard, including the sight of [[Menahuun]]s.\n\nIn [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], Walwahd was on duty when Menahuuns were detected in Bartyn's well-protected yacht ''[[Tria Blue]]''. After Bartyn's guards were killed, Walwahd asked for medical help and for a mortuary [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] before she was possibly killed by the Menahuuns during the attack.\n\nWalwahd also had a cousin who worked in a private trawler in [[Cape Regret]], and they were in contact over the years.<ref name=\"Reckonings\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GamerCite|7|Reckonings}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walwahd, Howe}}\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Dockmasters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lamaredd residents]]\n[[Category:Mon Calamari]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]"}}}]}}}}
