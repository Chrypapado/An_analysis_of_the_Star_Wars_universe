They founded the business [[Olin and Lands]], and started the resistance group [[The Eleven]] to oppose the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Olin's former rival, the Jedi-turned-[[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith-Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], killed Lands to provoke Olin.\n\n==Biography==\nRoan Lands was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who met [[Ferus Olin]] shortly after Olin left the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. They soon became partners as well as friends. Lands sold all of his possessions to finance the former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi's]] idea for a business, [[Olin and Lands]], in which the two of them would protect people who exposed corruption and dishonesty in various big businesses.<ref name=\"Book1\" /> On one occasion that Olin would later remember as the best [[Standard day/Legends|day]] of his life, they visited the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tati]] and swam together in a waterfall-fed natural pool.<ref name=\"Book4\">''[[The Last of the Jedi: Death on Naboo]]''</ref>\n\nShortly following the institution of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Lands and Olin started a resistance group called [[The Eleven]]. Knowing the consequences of rebellion, the partners made a pact not to find each other should one of them be captured or imprisoned. Along with the Eleven, they started a massive uprising on Bellassa following the Imperial ousting of the Bellassan monarch. However, they were no match for the power of the Empire, and most of them were either killed or jailed. While Olin managed to escape, Lands was put into an Imperial detention facility on Bellassa and tortured heavily with a series of numerous neurotoxins.<ref name=\"Book1\" />\n\nDuring his search to find Olin, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] encountered Lands who was numbed to the point of near death by the neurotoxins. [[Amie Antin]], a doctor and newly-joined member of the Eleven, tried her best to cure Lands using [[spectacillin]] to cure the apparent infection and [[gas binder]]s to rid his blood of the leftover toxins, but nothing worked. Kenobi infiltrated the [[Imperial Garrisons|Imperial Garrison]] to find out what toxins had been used on Lands and discovered that it was a mixture of neurotoxins consisting of [[Loquasin]] and [[Titroxinate]], then [[Skirtopanol/Legends|Skirtopanol]] on the final day, listed for use under \"Persuasion Techniques.\" After he was cured, Lands gave Kenobi clues as to where to find Olin.<ref name=\"Book1\" />\n\nA few weeks later, free from the Imperials, Lands reunited with Olin at the [[Nixor Spaceport]] and provided him with prefab shelters, food, and supplies to start an asteroid sanctuary for the survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]].\n\nLands later went back to Bellassa and was arrested along with [[Dona Telamark]] by the Empire on charges of conspiracy against the government of Bellassa and plotting to assassinate the Bellassan Imperial [[Advisor/Legends|Advisor]]. The two prisoners were held aboard the ''[[True Justice]]'', a ship owned by [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Sano Sauro]], in an effort to coerce Olin to work for the Empire. Scheduled for a speedy trial by Judge [[Bellican]], Attorney [[Oryon|Tomay Alcorn]], and law clerk [[Sam Weller]], the duo was unexpectedly set free when [[Fy-Tor-Ana|Solace]], Oryon, and [[Trever Flume]], impersonating the Imperial judicial team, hijacked the retrofitted [[YT-series/Legends|YT-series]] [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Transport/Legends|transport]].\n\nLands and The Eleven continued to resist the Empire on Bellassa. When Roan's former partner showed up on the Empire's side, the whole city of Ussa was demoralized. The Eleven knew that Olin was a double agent, but many Bellassans did not, so Lands used a signal to communicate to Olin to meet him. Olin told Lands that the Eleven could have 15 minutes to hit an Imperial factory for information. The three-person team was decided to be Lands, Flume, and [[Amie Antin]]. Everything went as planned until they stumbled across [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] himself. Olin arrived shortly, but Vader struck down Lands to provoke Olin. With his last breath, Olin and Lands shared their own private farewell.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAuthor [[Jude Watson]], who created Roan Lands and Ferus Olin, addressed via [[Wikipedia:Twitter|Twitter]] that she envisioned the pair as mutually in love and married.<ref name=\"Twitter\">{{Twitter|judymblundell|status/647169127363268609|[[Jude Watson]]|quote=@LelalMekha @antinezushi In my mind Ferus and Roan were married.
