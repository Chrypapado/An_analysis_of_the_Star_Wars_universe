Such beauty even in her name! I must make her mine!|[[Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo/Legends|Gorga]]|Boba Fett: Bounty on Bar-Kooda}}\n'''Anachro the H'uun''', or '''Anachro the Hutt''', was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[H'uun]] (a low-caste [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]) who lived on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. She was the daughter of [[Orko]] and wife of [[Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo/Legends|Gorga]], Orko's nemesis. To impress Orko and gain permission to marry Anachro, Gorga hired [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] to capture [[Bar-Kooda]]. Fett succeeded, and Anachro married Gorga. Nevertheless, the animosity between Orko and Gorga remained, much to Anachro's frustration.\n\n[[File:Ath.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Anachro lands on her kidnappers.]]\nWhile honeymooning on [[Skeebo]], Anachro was kidnapped by [[Slaver/Legends|slavers]] for a million-[[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] ransom. Gorga once again hired Fett's services following his killing of the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Toxus Li]]. This time, Gorga paid Fett to rescue Anachro. Orko, meanwhile, suspected the entire affair to be Gorga's doing and went to Skeebo as well.\n\nUnbeknownst to either Hutt was the imminent arrival [[Ry-Kooda]], who was seeking revenge for the death of Bar-Kooda, his brother. Despite the conflagration of Hutts, Skavers, and Ry-Kooda, Boba Fett was successful\u2014albeit in an unusual way. Fett attempted to lift Anachro from his [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] suspended from cables, but her weight proved to be too much\u2014she nearly strangled on the cables as well. Fett dropped her into a mine car and she rolled all the way to the exit, where she was launched through the air to land upon a cluster of Skavers. Although flustered and terrified, she was all right.\n\nAnachro later gave birth to [[Gorga's son|Gorga's child]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAnachro is the \"fat lady\" in the title ''[[Boba Fett: When the Fat Lady Swings]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Boba Fett: Bounty on Bar-Kooda]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Boba Fett: When the Fat Lady Swings]]''\n*''[[Boba Fett: Murder Most Foul]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Boba Fett]]''\n*{{FFCite|97|FET29-30, ''Boba Fett''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030911hutt|text=Hutt!
