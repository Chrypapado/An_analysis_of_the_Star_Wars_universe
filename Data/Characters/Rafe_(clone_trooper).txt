A member of the [[1st Platoon]], Rafe became a mercenary operating on [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Rafe was dour, pessimistic, and easily aggravated.\n\n==Biography==\nRafe was one of the millions of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] created on the aquatic [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]] for the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]], being trained for years as a standard trooper. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Rafe served as a rank-and-file member of the [[1st Platoon]] before being retired by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] from active duty. Making off with caches of armor and weaponry, Rafe and other platoon members fled to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] where they operated as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] group. Basing their operations on [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]] within [[Blackwind Crater]], Rafe and the Platoon were hired as the long-term guards of the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority's]] base of operations in the crater. Because of the accelerated age of the clone army, Rafe was physically closer to the age of seventy or eighty then to his chronological age of forty. Carrying a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]], [[vibroknife]], and worn armor; all standard issue from their time in the Grand Army, Rafe had developed a tremor. By the time of the Sorority's conflict with the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium]], only four others were still alive out of the original twenty-seven troopers that survived the Clone Wars. Rafe was joined by [[Zeke (clone trooper)|Zeke]], [[Oake]], [[Jayk (clone trooper)|Jayk]], and [[Tojo]].<ref name=\"MPQ\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mask of the Pirate Queen]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Clone troopers]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Saleucamians]]\n[[Category:Veiled Sorority members]]"}}}]}}}}
