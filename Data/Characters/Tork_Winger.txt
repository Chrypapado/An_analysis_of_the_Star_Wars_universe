When the Empire forced a peace during a fierce civil war on Garos IV, they placed Tork Winger as the Governor. He was a respected local politician who tried to find a middle ground between the Imperials and the locals.\n\n==Biography==\nTork Winger was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Garos IV]]<ref name=\"GH\" /> in [[62 BBY/Legends|62 BBY]]<ref name=\"Tork Winger birth date\" /> to a politically well-connected family.<ref name=\"GH\" /> Sometime between [[46 BBY/Legends|46 BBY]] and [[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]],<ref name=\"Winger military service\">The exact date of Winger's enlistment in the military is unknown; ''[[Turning Point]]'' references it as occurring \"almost 40 years ago,\" in a story set in [[6 BBY/Legends|6 BBY]]. ''[[A Glimmer of Hope]]'' references it as occurring \"almost 50 years ago,\" in a story set in [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]].</ref> Winger became one of the first [[Garosian]]s to enter the service of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], training at the [[Academy of Carida]] and joining the [[Army/Legends|army]]. After five [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of service, Winger returned to Garos IV, and entered [[Politics/Legends|politics]], using his familial connections.<ref name=\"TP\">{{Journal|5|Turning Point}}</ref> By the time Winger was 30, in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], he was the top aide to Garos' highest authority.<ref name=\"GH\" />\n\nBy [[16 BBY/Legends|16 BBY]], Winger was serving as the Assistant [[Minister of Defense (Garos IV)|Minister of Defense]]. He appointed [[Magir Paca]], the son of one of his [[Magir Paca's father|friends]], as an aide, and mentored the young man as Paca rose through the ranks of the diplomatic service.<ref name=\"TP\" />\n\nAlongside the noted Sundar [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]] [[Tionthes Turi]], Winger negotiated a truce between the warring factions of the [[Garosian Civil War]], ending eighty-two years of constant violence. The city of [[Garan]], which had been the location of the majority of the conflict, was rebuilt and Garosian and Sundar leaders entered into peace negotiations. During the process, minor violations of the truce occurred, but two incidents were remembered more than others. The first was the [[Whahalla Massacre]]. The second was the assassination of Winger's friend, businessman and peace advocate [[West Haslip]], and his wife, [[Nieka Haslip|Nieka]], in [[12 BBY/Legends|12 BBY]]. Winger was present when they were killed by the Sundar bomb, and was injured in the explosion.<ref name=\"TP\" />\n\nWinger became the leading authority on the conflict, and was respected by leaders and diplomats on both sides due to his reputation as a just individual.<ref name=\"TP\" /> However, Winger's inability to truly end the conflict on Garos gnawed at him.<ref name=\"GH\" /> In [[6 BBY/Legends|6 BBY]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] began to take a greater interest in Garos IV. Winger hoped that their presence would finally ensure a lasting peace between the Garosians and the Sundars.<ref name=\"TP\" /> The Empire's methods of ending the war were not what Winger had hoped for, but he could not argue with the result. He accepted that sacrifices had to be made for the greater good.<ref name=\"GH\" />\n\n[[File:Tork_and_Alex_Winger.png|thumb|left|200px|Tork and his daughter [[Alexandra Winger|Alex]]]]\nThe same year, a friend of Winger's, Imperial [[Senior Lieutenant/Legends|Senior Lieutenant]] [[Brandei]] of the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Judicator/Legends|''Judicator'']], contacted him. Brandei had just arrived on Garos IV, and requested to meet with Winger and his wife at the [[Ariana medical center|medical center]] in Ariana. Upon arrival, Winger was presented with a young girl, who Brandei claimed was the child of Rebels destroyed<ref name=\"TP\" /> on the planet [[Janara III]].<ref name=\"P\">{{Journal|7|Passages}}</ref> Brandei knew of the Wingers' inability to conceive, and had convinced the [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the ''Judicator'' to foster the child with the Wingers. Winger and Sali accepted, and accepted the child, [[Alexandra Winger|Alexandra]], into their home.<ref name=\"TP\" />\n\nShortly after, Winger was appointed as Garos IV's Imperial [[Governor/Legends|Governor]]<ref name=\"TP\" /> by [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] due to the high regard that he was held in by the people of Garos IV. However, Winger's popularity did not stop many Garosians believing that the new governor was a traitor for his acceptance of the Empire.<ref name=\"GH\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|5|Turning Point}}\n*{{Journal|1|A Glimmer of Hope}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=A Glimmer of Hope}}\n*{{Journal|2|Whispers in the Dark}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|3|Mission to Zila}}\n*{{Journal|4|Shadows of Darkness}}\n*{{Journal|6|Rendezvous with Destiny}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|12|Betrayal by Knight}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/fiction/shadesofgray/index.html|text=''Shades of Gray''|int=Shades of Gray|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-shades-of-gray-from-the-adventures-of-alex-winger.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}} {{Hologram}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|16|The Garos System}} {{C|Cut article}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|Under ''Sundari''}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://alexwinger.wordpress.com/2007/12/08/tork-winger/ Charlene Newcomb's Tork Winger page]\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Tork Winger\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Winger, Tork}}\n[[Category:Garosians]]\n[[Category:Governors of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
