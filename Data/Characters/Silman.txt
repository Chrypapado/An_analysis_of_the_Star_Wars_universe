Prior to the [[Separatist Crisis]], Silman accompanied [[Jedi Master]] [[Sifo-Dyas]] on a [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre\u2013Naboo Crisis)|mission]] to [[Oba Diah]]. However, their shuttle was shot down and Sifo-Dyas was killed under the orders of [[Count]] [[Dooku]], a [[Sith apprentice]]. Silman survived but was kept as a prisoner by the [[Pyke Syndicate]] for the next ten years. He was rediscovered by Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] near the end of the [[Clone Wars]]. Before he could reveal Dooku's involvement in Sifo-Dyas' death, he was murdered by the Sith Lord.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:TLO-Silman_file.png|thumb|left|188px|A younger Silman, as seen in his file]]\nPrior to the [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of [[Naboo]],<ref name=\"DB:S\" /> Silman was the personal aide to [[Galactic Republic|Republic's]] [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] leader, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]]. Silman was then assigned to assist former [[Jedi]] [[Jedi High Council|High Council]] member, [[Jedi Master|Master]] [[Sifo-Dyas]], with secret negotiations with the [[Pyke]] [[Pyke Syndicate|Syndicate]] on [[Oba Diah]]. However, after the negotiations, Silman's and Sifo-Dyas' [[T-6 shuttle|T-6]] [[Jedi T-6 shuttle 775519|shuttle]] was [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre\u2013Naboo Crisis)|shot down]] over Oba Diah's [[Oba Diah moon|moon]] by the Pykes, on orders from a man named [[Dooku|Tyranus]].<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\nDuring the attack, their shuttle's long-range transmitter was knocked out. Silman managed to bailed out in an emergency survival capsule numbered 775519 and survived the crash. However, Sifo-Dyas was killed but not before recording a [[hologram]] message confessing his role in the commissioning of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name=\"Force Collector\">''[[Force Collector]]''</ref> His body was given to Tyranus by the Pykes. Silman survived the crash and was imprisoned by the Pykes [[prison]] on Oba Diah. The leader of the Pykes, [[Lom Pyke]], took Silman's medallion and wore it.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\n===Clone Wars===\nFor several [[Standard year|years]], Silman was kept in the Pykes' prison as insurance, in case Tyranus, the Republic, or the Jedi discovered Sifo-Dyas's true fate and the Pyke's involvement. As a result of his prolonged incarceration, Silman's mental health deteriorated. He befriended and fed the vermin and lice that shared his cell.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\n[[File:CrazySilman-TLO.png|thumb|right|333px|After more than a decade in isolation, Silman had drifted into insanity.]]\nWhile investigating Master Sifo-Dyas' role in engineering the Clone Wars, [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] [[Mission to Oba Diah (Clone Wars)|traveled]] to [[Oba Diah]] after learning that Silman had accompanied Sifo-Dyas during a mission to mediate a conflict on [[Felucia]]. In return for an amnesty for the Pykes' betrayal of Sifo-Dyas, Lom Pyke revealed that the Pykes had kept Silman alive and led him to his cell.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\nKenobi questioned Silman about the identity of the second Jedi who supposedly accompanied and betrayed them. Despite his mental state, Silman managed to tell Kenobi and Skywalker that someone wanted to impersonate Master Sifo-Dyas and had ordered the Pykes to kill them. However, Silman was [[Force choke]]d by Dooku, who revealed himself as Tyranus, the man behind Sifo-Dyas' [[death]].<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSilman was a [[human]] [[Gender|man]] with blue eyes, light skin, and brown hair. He served as an aide to Chancellor Valorum. Due to his imprisonment by the Pykes, Silman had become gaunt and pale with his hair turning white. His mental health also suffered as a result of his imprisonment, leading him to regard the lice and vermin that inhabited his cells as friends. Despite his physical and mental deterioration, Silman still maintained enough of his faculty and tried to expose Count Dooku's role in Master Sifo-Dyas' death.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nWhile working as a Chancellor's aide, Silman wore white robes and a medallion. He lost his medallion to the Pykes. Due to his imprisonment, Silman was reduced to wearing rags.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSilman first appeared in ''[[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions]]'' episode \"[[The Lost One]],\" which premiered on the streaming platform [[Netflix, Inc.|Netflix]] on [[March 7]], [[2014]]. He was voiced by [[Brian George]], who also voiced [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|The Lost One}} {{1st}}\n*''[[Force Collector]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Force Collector (audiobook)|''Force Collector'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/the-lost-one-episode-guide|text=\"The Lost One\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{Databank|count-dooku|Count Dooku|archivedate=20170705061812}}\n*{{Databank|silman|Silman|archivedate=20180410010354}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Silman#kanon\n|fr=Silman\n|ja=\u30b7\u30eb\u30de\u30f3\n|nl=Silman\n|pl=Silman\n|ru=\u0421\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
