He helped [[Meetra Surik]] to get an open [[starport visa]] and to retrieve information from a broken [[Droid/Legends|droid]] regarding the murder of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sullio]] of the [[Onderonian military]]. The information revealed Sullio's murderer not to be medical doctor [[Dhagon Ghent]], but a different [[Sullio's murderer|individual]].\n\n{{GameLS|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nLater he was hired by [[General Vaklu]] to slice into [[Iziz Royal Palace]] defense systems. He accomplished this by using the [[Epicenter Six]] program, a computer program that he himself had written. However, Kiph was eventually found by Surik, who persuaded him to leave the palace and Vaklu. Kiph, fearing for his own life, grudgingly agreed and left, trying to get as far away from the [[Second Battle of Onderon (Onderon Civil War)|battle]] as possible.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlternatively, if the player chooses to follow the path of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], Kiph can be found slicing for the [[Onderon Royalist|\nRoyalist]] [[Onderon Soldier|soldiers]]. Following either ending, the Exile has the possibility to kill him.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kiph\n|ru=\u041a\u0438\u0444\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
