A member of the [[Chattza Clan|Chattza]] clan, he was killed when he, along with a group of other henchmen, attempted to assassinate the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Ki-Adi-Mundi/Legends|Ki-Adi-Mundi]] during a [[Skiff/Legends|skiff]] ride through the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]]. The only one brave enough to face the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Hoonta boasted that he did not fear his \"[[The Force/Legends|magic]]\", but he was quickly dispatched by the [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] Jedi. Immediately before bisecting the unfortunate mercenary, Ki-Adi-Mundi noted that his unfortunate lack of faith in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] was only matched by his lack of skill in combat.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 9|''Star Wars'' (1998) 9]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Hoonta\n|es=Hoonta\n|hu=Hoonta\n}}\n\n[[Category:Chattza Clan]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
