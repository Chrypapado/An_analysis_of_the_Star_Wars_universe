I turn toward it because it is the light.|Qui-Gon Jinn|Master & Apprentice}}\n'''Qui-Gon Jinn''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Gender|male]], was a venerable if maverick [[Jedi Master]] who lived during the last [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Republic Era]]. He was a wise and well-respected member of the [[Jedi Order]], and was offered a seat on the [[Jedi Council]], but chose to reject and follow his own path. Adhering to a philosophy centered around the [[Living Force]], Jinn strove to follow the will of [[the Force]] even when his actions conflicted with the wishes of the High [[Jedi Council|Council]]. After encountering [[Anakin Skywalker]], Jinn brought him to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]], convinced he had found the [[Chosen One]]. His [[Death|dying]] wish was for Skywalker to become a [[Jedi]] and ultimately restore balance to the Force.\n\n[[Reproduction|Born]] on the [[Core Worlds|Core World]] Coruscant, the [[capital]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] in around [[80 BBY]], Jinn eventually learned the ways of the Force as the [[Padawan]] of [[Jedi Master]] [[Dooku]] before ultimately attaining the rank of [[Jedi Knight]]. He would go on to take an apprentice of his own, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who adhered to the principles of the [[Jedi Code]] more than his own master. Although their relationship was sometimes tough, the two Jedi overcame early difficulties during a [[mission to Pijal]], which concluded in Jinn turning down a request to join the Jedi Council to continue teaching his apprentice. When the [[Trade Federation]] initiated a [[blockade]] of the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] [[planet]] [[Naboo]] in [[32 BBY]], Jinn and Kenobi were [[Escape from the Saak'ak|dispatched]] to resolve the crisis at the request of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]]. Influenced by the mysterious [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]], the Federation launched a full-scale [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of Naboo, forcing the Jedi to rescue [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] after the fall of [[Theed]].\n\nDuring their journey to the [[Galaxy|galactic]] capital, the group was forced to land on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet [[Tatooine]] where Jinn encountered a young [[Slavery|slave]] named Anakin Skywalker. Using a scientific method to gauge the boy's potential, he learned that Skywalker had more [[midi-chlorian]]s in his [[DNA|blood]] than any Force-sensitive in [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]], including [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]]. The revelation that he was the result of a miracle birth&mdash;a child born of [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|a mother]] but had no [[Parent|father]]&mdash;confirmed Jinn's suspicion that Skywalker was the Chosen One destined to restore balance to the Force. Before departing the [[desert]] world with Skywalker, Jinn was confronted by Sidious' [[Sith apprentice]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]]. Although their [[Duel on Tatooine|duel]] was brief, it convinced Jinn that the [[Sith]] had returned after a [[millennium]] of silence.\n\nAt the [[Jedi temple|Temple]], Jinn was adamant that Skywalker was the Chosen One and should, therefore, be inducted into the Jedi Order. However, having inspected Skywalker for themselves, the High Council deemed him too old, emotional, and dangerously full of fear and anger. Jinn saw their decision as a temporary setback, but the need to resolve the situation on [[Queen]] Amidala's [[homeworld]] forced him to set aside his plans for Skywalker. During the [[Battle of Naboo]], Jinn and Kenobi confronted [[Darth]] Maul together. While they initially managed to fend off the Sith [[Lord]]'s attacks, master and apprentice were eventually separated during the [[lightsaber duel]], resulting in Jinn sustaining a mortal injury. Rushing to his master's aid, Kenobi fought and ultimately defeated the [[Dathomirian]] Sith but could not save Jinn. With his last breath, Jinn made Kenobi promise that he would take Skywalker as his apprentice. Having secured Kenobi's word, Jinn became [[Immortality|one with the Force]], dying with the certainty that he had found the prophesied Chosen One.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.''\"<br />\"''Don't be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice, just as you were once his.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Count Dooku|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\n[[File:Jedi-Dooku-Art.png|thumb|left|220px|Count Dooku, Jinn's former master.]]\nQui-Gon Jinn was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] born on the [[The galaxy|galactic]] [[capital]] of [[Coruscant]]<ref name=\"Ultimate\" /> circa [[80 BBY]].<ref name=\"Date\" /> Identified as a [[Force-sensitive]], he was taken for [[Jedi training|training]] by the [[Jedi Order]] and was assigned to the [[Heliost Clan]] where he learned [[lightsaber combat]] from [[Jedi Master]] [[Tera Sinube]].<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" /> When Jinn was twelve years old, he was assigned as a [[Padawan]] to Jedi Master [[Dooku]], from whom he learned the ways of [[the Force]].<ref name=\"Ultimate\" /><ref name=\"Episode II\" /> He'd spent his last night in the younglings' cr\u00e8che laughing with his friends, imagining all the adventures he would have as a Padawan, and practicing with his lightsaber in the sparring room until Master [[Yaddle]] ordered him to bed.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nAround [[68 BBY]],<ref name=\"68 BBY\"> Jinn was twelve years old when [[Gender|he]] became [[Padawan|apprentice]] to [[Dooku]]. Since his [[Reproduction|birth]] [[Standard year|year]] can be approximated to [[80 BBY]], Jinn would have been twelve around [[68 BBY]].</ref> when he presented himself to his new Master in Dooku's quarters, Dooku observed that Jinn was frightened. After a moment of silence, and with pressing from Dooku, Jinn confessed that he was. When asked why, after looking into himself through the fear, Jinn answered that he was not afraid of Dooku, but of not becoming a Jedi, that he was afraid of failing and of not being worthy. Dooku then summarized it as Jinn being afraid of himself, of a future not being the one he wanted. Jinn confirmed it, fearing that Dooku would reject him for his cowardice. Dooku instead said that it was very wise, surprising Jinn. Smiling, Dooku explained that most Padawans would deny their fear, and even if they admitted it, they would not have Jinn's self-knowledge. Dooku further praised Jinn for his honesty, insight, and intelligence.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nTo help Jinn understand the Jedi Temple more completely, Dooku then took him throughout most of the Temple, including the Padawans' sparring dojo, a dojo where [[Jedi Knight]]s trained, and the [[Great Assembly Room]]. Jinn also saw the various meditation chambers, which he didn't find as exciting, but still interesting. On the other hand, Jinn spent long minutes in the arboretum, wandering through the trees, ferns, and flowers of a thousand different worlds. Their last stop was the [[Jedi Archives]], where they examined [[holocron]]s of various eras, not to study them, but simply for Jinn to learn his way around. While doing so, an ancient holocron, more ancient and of a different shape than the rest, caught Jinn's eye. When he questioned his Master about it, he was shocked by the expression on Dooku's face, almost as if he considered it an enemy. Dooku answered that it was a holocron of Jedi prophecies. Jinn asked if there are Jedi prophets, to which Dooku replied not any longer. He explained to Jinn that the mystics sought undue knowledge of the future, which led them down dangerous paths. The dark side often tempted those drawn too deeply into them. Dooku then finished by saying that is why the Jedi study prophecy no longer, then turned to leave, which meant Jinn had to follow. Jinn then asked Dooku if just wanting to know the future can lead to the dark side. Dooku replied that it takes more than that. This was Qui-Gon's first encounter with the holocron of prophecies, and it would not be the last.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nAfter four months as a Padawan, the Council sent him with his master to [[Shurrupak]] to participate in a battle on its surface, which was Qui-Gon's very first. While the shuttle they were in approached the planet under heavy fire, a nervous Jinn reassured himself that he was ready for battle, looking to his Master Dooku as an example to aspire to as a fearless Jedi. As they arrived at [[Primus Base]], Qui-Gon had his first meeting with [[Rael Averross]], Dooku's first Padawan and a famous lightsaber duelist. After greeting each other heartily, Dooku introduced Rael to his new Padawan. While Dooku then conferred with the generals, Rael put one hand on the still-nervous Jinn's shoulder. Rather than comforting Jinn about the battle, Rael instead commented that Dooku is hard to get to know and offered to help Qui-Gon out. Since he was Dooku's previous Padawan, Rael told Qui-Gon that he could ask him any questions that he might not feel comfortable asking Dooku yet and be his sparring partner if he wanted. With his first battle looming ahead, Qui-Gon accepted his offer. As they, too, went to talk to the generals, Qui-Gon felt as though Rael Averross was the link between the Padawan he was and the Jedi Knight he desperately wished to be. He viewed his journey to be easier now that he had a friend to show him the path.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nSometime after that battle, Qui-Gon was doing homework in Dooku's quarters while his Master was in conference with an official from [[Badtibira]]. He then had a surprise visit from Rael Averross, who greeted Jinn warmly. Qui-Gon greeted him with a similar warmth, then asked what he was doing there. Rael explained that he had just returned from Shurrupak, then asked what Jinn was doing in Dooku's quarters since he wouldn't be returning for another few hours. Jinn explained that Dooku lets him do his homework in his quarters if he doesn't disturb him. In this case, Jinn was reporting on the different schools of theosophy a century ago. Upon Rael's grimace and questioning, if he had angered Dooku somehow, Jinn admitted that he chose the topic despite knowing that it wouldn't be interesting because he thought it would be easy. It wasn't.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nUpon receiving a negative from Jinn if it was too late to change his topic, Rael grinned, and motioning for Qui-Gon to follow him, offered to show him some history worth studying. They went to the Jedi Archives, and together they studied the one and only holocron that had ever interested Jinn: the one that held the ancient prophecies. They were all fascinating to him, and Qui-Gon kept reading, unable to stop. He asked Rael if the ancient mystics had these visions in trances, to which he confirmed. After contemplating these prophecies, Jinn remarked that Dooku said he should ignore this holocron and that he doesn't believe in the prophecies. This confused Rael since Dooku, he said, was the one who introduced Rael to it and that it used to be that one could hardly pry the holocron out of his quarters. Qui-Gon said that he didn't know when or why that changed and that Dooku didn't explain. A surprised Rael said he would ask Dooku about it and remarked that Dooku had changed a lot. Qui-Gon protested, surprising Rael, then said not until he's finished his report. Rael then laughed so loud he received a stern look from [[Jocasta Nu]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n===Tracking Shenda Mol===\nJinn and his Jedi Master Dooku became part of a [[Numidian Prime]] [[Numidian Prime strike team|strike team]]. They were assembled to track and find the notorious [[Falleen]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Shenda Mol]]. They eventually tracked her at her [[Mol's hideout|hideout]] on the planet Numidian Prime. While searching for her hideout, Mol captured Jinn. Before Mol could kill Jinn, Dooku struck her down with [[Force lightning]] to save his apprentice, causing Jinn a degree of concern.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nJinn later confided what Dooku did to Rael Averross, though at the time, Averross expressed that he was not all too concerned regarding his former master's conduct.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> At some point in his life after the mission, Jinn went through trials on [[Felucia]], and&mdash;although his commitment was tested&mdash;he ultimately stayed loyal to the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars new\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''</ref> At some point during his apprenticeship, Jinn met the [[Wookiee]] [[Brennonn]] and befriended her. They shared many adventures together, with Brennonn saving Jinn on two occasions. During the second of those adventures, events transpired that resulted in Jinn feeling as though they saved each other. He also came to know the Wookiee [[Balfus]].<ref name=\"Life Day\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=3|story=[[Life Day (comic)|Life Day]]}}</ref>\n\n===Master to Obi-Wan Kenobi===\n====Becoming a mentor====\n[[File:Be-Mindful-Obi-Wan.png|thumb|right|250px|Becoming the mentor to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn sought to teach him the best he could.]]\nJinn became a [[Jedi]] Master in his own right, a master who developed an independent attitude towards the Jedi Order. Others saw him as a maverick Jedi, one who would disobey the [[Jedi Code]] if he felt it was the right decision. Jinn eventually took on a Padawan named [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who believed that Jinn could've been a member of the [[Jedi High Council]] if he followed the Code,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> though as Kenobi knew, Jinn had rejected an offer to join.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> On one occasion, Kenobi watched in silence as his master told the council he disagreed with them. At another point, the master and apprentice sparred, with Jinn complimenting Kenobi's skill. On another occasion, the two visited a plain and overlooked its native creatures, giving Jinn the chance to teach Kenobi about how the Force existed in all the life that surrounded them.<ref name=\"AoR Obi-Wan\">[[Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1|''Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi'' 1]]</ref>\n\nJinn was able to sense whenever Kenobi was discontent, which proved useful on some missions, yet also annoyed Kenobi.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref> At one point, Jinn and Kenobi traveled to the planet [[Lah'mu]] to visit a [[Chief's fortress|fortress]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Jinn had at least some contact with his old Master after taking on Kenobi and spoke highly of his Padawan to Dooku.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> However, Dooku left the Jedi Order after the [[invasion of Serenno]],<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" /> secretly becoming a [[Sith apprentice]] to the elusive [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]] sometime later. At some point, Jinn met the [[Togorian]] Jedi [[Jak'zin]], who had also looked up to Dooku.<ref name=\"AoR Dooku\">[[Age of Republic - Count Dooku 1|''Age of Republic - Count Dooku'' 1]]</ref>\n\nJinn taught Kenobi as best he could, although Kenobi did not always agree with his master's teaching strategies. Despite his Padawan's clear proficiencies in lightsaber techniques, Jinn held Kenobi to practicing only basic methods, which impacted his apprentice's confidence and their relationship. Although Jinn did so to not rush his apprentice and allow Kenobi to carve out his own distinct style out of mastery of the fundamental [[cadence]]s, his lack of clarity on his teaching philosophy hurt Kenobi.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n====Protecting Duchess Satine====\n{{Quote|Master Qui-Gon and I spent a year on Mandalore, protecting the duchess from insurgents who had threatened her world.

The leader of the New Mandalorian movement, [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]],<ref name=\"Fact File\">{{FFCite|y=2014|98|MAN 1-4, Mandalore}}</ref> became a target for the traditionalists, who hired [[bounty hunter]]s to eliminate her. However, Jinn and Kenobi were sent on an extended mission to Mandalore, where they were assigned to protect Kryze.<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\">{{TCW|Voyage of Temptation}}</ref>\n\nJinn and Kenobi spent a [[Standard year|year]] on Mandalore with Kryze, remaining on the run from the bounty hunters. The three remained unsure of what the future would bring, but they continued their effort to survive, living hand to mouth everyday. During the mission, Kenobi developed romantic feelings for Kryze.<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\" /> Jinn became aware of the unlikely romance between his apprentice and the noble.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> Eventually, the civil war came to an end, with the New Mandalorians coming to power and Kryze becoming the ruler of Mandalore. Although Kenobi would have left the Jedi and stayed behind to be with her had she had asked him to, Kryze never did, so he and Jinn left the planet.<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\" />\n\n====Mission to Pijal====\n{{Quote|I've never been to Pijal.|Qui-Gon Jinn|Master & Apprentice}}\n[[File:PijalCover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The mission to Pijal]]\nCirca [[40 BBY]], Jinn and his Padawan Kenobi undertook a [[Mission to Teth|mission]] to [[Teth]] to thwart [[Wanbo]] the [[Hutt]]. The two Jedi escaped Teth, but not without complications including a key miscommunication between master and apprentice. Upon returning to Coruscant, the [[Jedi High Council]] extended to Jinn an invitation to join their ranks, as with Master [[Poli Dapatian]] was stepping down by that month's end. Jinn was shocked to be asked due to his disagreements with the Council on various occasions, and while he was initially pleased to hear the offer, he thought of his Padawan, who he would have to pass on to a new master if he were to accept. While it would solve the growing problems between them, Jinn felt guilt at the thought of it and thus told the Council that he would meditate on their proposition.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a [[Politics|political]] dispute erupted on the [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] planet [[Pijal]]. A performance troupe known as the [[Opposition]] that began playing political pranks to protest [[Governance Treaty|a treaty]] signing that would end the absolute monarchy on Pijal, allow the world to join the Republic, and give more power to [[Czerka Arms|Czerka Corporation]] was thought to be making increasingly violent attacks nearing the treaty's signing. Jinn's old friend Rael Averross requested Jinn and his Padawan's assistance to end the dispute and ensure the signing of the treaty. The Council [[mission to Pijal|sent]] Jinn and his Padawan to Pijal to help. However, as the mission began, Kenobi became aware of the offer presented to Jinn regarding the Jedi Council when the two met with [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Kirames Kaj]]. Jinn felt great shame at not being the first to tell his Padawan learner. Before they left, Jinn sought out Kenobi and the Padawan's dojo. He attempted to apologize for not being the first to tell him the news and said that he had several reservations that he had to dwell on before committing to the position, but Kenobi made a sarcastic reply. Jinn told his Padawan that he would continue to discuss the matter when Kenobi was in a more rational mood, and when Kenobi quipped again, Jinn sadly said that he supposed that the Force always allowed things to turn out for the best. As they traveled to Pijal, the tension between them grew.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nJinn and Kenobi both were briefed on the situation, learning that Averross served Crown [[Prince]]ss [[Fanry]], who was only fourteen years old, as an advisor and that he needed to protect her from the Opposition as she waited to take Pijal's throne. Jinn and Averross became reacquainted quickly, although Jinn was skeptical of several of Averross's choices during his service, as Averross also loosely interpreted the Jedi Code. As he and Kenobi began to do more investigating on [[Pijal's moon]], they encountered two jewel thieves, [[Pax Maripher]] and [[Rahara Wick]]. Although Maripher was very abrasive towards Jinn, Wick was more cooperative. Onboard their ship, the [[Meryx (starship)|''Meryx'']], Jinn recruited the two to help them find the terrorists that posed a threat to the treaty. Shortly after returning, Jinn received a vision of the event, which turned into a bloody battle. He brought it to Averross's attention, but the older Jedi did not share his level of concern.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nAs their investigation continued, Jinn eventually met with the Opposition's leader, [[Halin Azucca]], and learned that her group was being framed. Although they had peacefully made demonstrations against the treaty, the violent terrorist acts that had alerted the Republic were not caused by Azucca's people. As Qui-Gon learned of the complications surrounding the treaty due to the lack of Pijali representation and the heavy influence gained by the [[Czerka Arms|Czerka Corporation]], he decided to oppose the treaty himself and refused to act as a Republic representative.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nHowever, eventually, the Jedi discovered that Fanry was deceiving them and had been building a military group called the blackguards, framing the Opposition to restore the full monarchy. At the coronation, she rejected the treaty as well as the Republic's influence, proving herself to having been underestimated by the Jedi. Ready to remove Czerka influence from the system by force, she prepared to attack their ships. Jinn attempted to convince her to stop and prevent the innocent casualties that were the Czerka slaves onboard the ships, but when she refused, Jinn took matters into his own hands, and with the help of Kenobi as well as their two new friends Maripher and Wick, they succeeded in saving the slaves. After the mission, Jinn decided to stick with training Kenobi and declined the offer to join the Jedi Council.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n===Truths of the Force===\n====Discovering the secrets of life after death====\nSometime during his life, Jinn began discovering the secrets to [[Force spirit|manifesting his consciousness]] after [[death]].<ref name=\"Voices\">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref> He traveled to a [[Wellspring of Life|planet]] strong with the Force, a [[Planet|world]] that legend said was the birthplace of life and the origin of [[midi-chlorian]]s. He learned from five [[Force Priestesses]] who had retained their consciousness after death.<ref name=\"Force-Planet-SWE\">{{SWE|locations|force-planet|Force planet}}</ref> He learned that, when a living thing died, its life passed through the [[Living Force]] and into the [[Cosmic Force]] to become one with the Force.<ref name=\"Voices\" />\n\nAs the Living Force and Cosmic Force existed in tandem, it became possible for one to retain consciousness and physically manifest themselves after death. Jinn was considered worthy of the knowledge of eternal life and secretly began his training to unlock its mysteries fully.<ref name=\"Voices\" /> He also learned from a [[Shaman of the Whills]] that achieving eternal consciousness required absolute selflessness.<ref name=\"SWEQui-GonJinn\" />\n\n====Questioning his purpose====\n{{Quote|Being called a coward isn't what bothered me, Master Yoda. It was being called a great warrior.|Qui-Gon Jinn|Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn 1}}\n[[File:Brin_conflict.jpg|thumb|left|300x330px|Qui-Gon during the rescue of Th'er]]\nSometime between [[44 BBY|44]] and [[32 BBY]],<ref name=\"PadawanDate\">This event takes place between [[44 BBY|44]] and [[32 BBY]] per the reasoning [[Template:KenobiPadawanDate|here]].</ref> Jinn and Kenobi were sent to the planet [[Bri'n]] to establish negotiations between the the [[Priest]]ess [[Th'er]] of Wood and the [[Metal Clan]]. However, the Metal Clan soldiers instead tried to kill Jinn and the Priestess. After deflecting many [[Laser|blaster bolts]] with his lightsaber, the Jedi contacted Kenobi to start their [[Eta-class shuttle|''Eta''-class shuttle]] and inform him about the failed negotiations. After being surrounded by the Metal Clan, Th'er proclaimed that Jinn was a warrior who could take down all who opposed her, yet Jinn instead used [[Force jump]] to escape with her aboard their shuttle, ordering Kenobi to take them to Coruscant so as to protect the Priestess.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\">[[Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn 1|''Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn'' 1]]</ref>\n\nTh'er was nevertheless disguised by Coruscant&mdash;viewing it as a city of metal&mdash;and demanded Jinn to act as a warrior, ordering him to cut down every member of the Metal Clan. Although Jinn informed her that was not the path of the Jedi Order, Th'er felt Jinn was instead a coward who did not live up to the legends that proclaimed the Jedi to be great soldiers. Being called a warrior caused great distress for Jinn. Afterward, he returned to the Jedi Temple, where he did not report to the Jedi High Council, seeing as Kenobi had filed his own report. Nevertheless, sensing a great turmoil in Jinn that had been present for sometime, Yoda located the Jedi Master on one of the Temple's balconies under the pretense of asking for him to report to the Council. Jinn quickly saw through Yoda's claim, leading to a discussion about how the Jedi should act between the two masters.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\nEven though Yoda and him had different opinions, they both agreed that Jinn should seek answers. Needing a world full of life to find a deep communion with the Force, Jinn&mdash;travelling off Coruscant in his [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor|Delta-7 Jedi Interceptor]] with his [[Qui-Gon Jinn's astromech droid|astromech droid]]&mdash;trusted the Force to guide him to answers, resulting in him coming out of hyperspace above a [[Unidentified world (Qui-Gon Jinn)|charted but unnamed world]]. After leaving his ship and admiring the planet's beauty, Jinn quickly felt the presence of the dark side on the world, coming to see that a spreading darkness was starting to corrupt the planet. Unsure whether the Force sought for him to stop it or learn from it, Jinn continued, finding a temple and sitting upon a throne inside. Pondering whether he would find light in the dark monument, Jinn entered a frightening [[Force vision]].<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\n[[File:Jinn-consumed-by-darkness.png|right|thumb|250px|In a Force vision, Qui-Gon Jinn learned that unchecked violence would only lead to the dark side.]]\nIn his vision, Jinn&mdash;his skin and [[Jedi robes]] covered in marks&mdash;was surrounded by red humanoid beings who grew out of dark tendrils. Though at least one of these beings tried to attack him as he fought, Jinn quickly ignited his lightsaber and cut the beings down, only for the red coloration to vanish from those he had killed. Jinn saw he had murdered Jedi, and the same darkness that he had seen on their bodies began to consume him; by choosing violence, the dark side had gained power over him. As the darkness wrapped across his face, Jinn awoke from his vision horrified, only to see the light side had entered into the monument. He realized the Force had taught him he could find balance that could be achieved without conflict, as unchecked violence would make the Jedi turn into what they sought to confront. In fact, he found that some of the planet's dark corruption had instead formed into flowers, existing in harmony with the light.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\nLeaving the planet&mdash;albeit with new questions about the nature of the Force&mdash;and returning to Coruscant, Jinn found Th'er in one of the city world's parks, where offered to help her find off-world allies with whom to fight against the Metal Clan. He argued she needed to find balance with these potential allies, so she agreed to his offer. During the night, he again met with Yoda on a temple balcony, leading to another discussion about the Force. Speaking with the Grand Master, Jinn defended finding balance in the Force, believing the Jedi could not be too rigid yet could also not give into the dark side.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\n===Continued lessons===\n====Life Day====\n[[File:Rescue_of_Qui-Gon_Jinn.png|thumb|right|Jinn and Kenobi face off against Korgan.]]\nAt another point between 44 and 32 BBY,<ref name=\"PadawanDate\" /> Jinn told Kenobi he would be taking him on a training exercise, keeping it secret that they would be going to observe the Wookiees' celebration of [[Life Day]] on<ref name=\"Life Day\" /> the [[planet]]<ref name=\"Ultimate\" /> [[Kashyyyk]] in the village of his old friend Brennonn, who had accepted his offer to visit. After entering the village, Jinn advised his Padawan to remain patient after the young man expressed confusion, reminding him to focus on what was instead of what he had expected. Though Kenobi found it hard to focus amid a celebration, Jinn continued their visit, educating his Padawan about Wookiee culture before asking what he made of it. Pleased with Kenobi's answer that it was as if the Wookiees were celebrating the Force, he explained the unconventional training he wanted Kenobi to partake in; he was asking him to focus on the energy of Kashyyyk, given that it was the Force. He then informed his Padawan they would speak with the Wookiees when Kenobi revealed he felt something different.<ref name=\"Life Day\" />\n\nSuddenly, the two Jedi were interrupted when Brennonn spotted Jinn, resulting in the Wookiee hugging him from how such she had missed him. Jinn shared her sentiment and began to introduce her to Kenobi, only for her to hug him as well. After Jinn explained his history with the Wookiee to Kenobi and thanked her for letting them come, she told him that Balfus was missing. As Jinn inquired about what actions she had taken concerning the missing Wookiee, both he and Kenobi felt a [[disturbance in the Force]]; several [[Trandoshan]] hunters suddenly attacked the village, launching nets from the trees to kidnap more Wookiees. Jinn and Kenobi fought against the Trandoshans, defeating many of them. However, Jinn himself was eventually captured when he demanded the hunters to surrender. Along with the captured Wookiees, Jinn was taken away by a [[MSP80 Pteropter hover pod]].<ref name=\"Life Day\" />\n\nAlthough Jinn, as he was taken away, had told Kenobi it was up to him to rescue the Wookiees,<ref name=\"Life Day\" /> the Jedi Master tried to negotiate the Wookiees' release with the Trandoshans' leader, [[Korgan]]. However, Korgan wanted to capture Kenobi too, and Jinn warned him that his greed would have been his downfall. Jinn waited in his cage until Kenobi [[Rescue of Qui-Gon Jinn|arrived]]. Kenobi pretended to surrender but, when Korgan was distracted, he opened Jinn's cage with the Force. Jinn [[Telekinesis|Force-pulled]] his lightsaber and ignited it. As Jinn was freed, many Wookiees arrived to support the two Jedi: the Trandoshans, being outnumbered, surrendered and freed the Wookiee prisoners. After returning to the village, the Life Day celebration began.<ref name=\"Life Day 2\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=4|story=[[Life Day Part 2]]}}</ref>\n\n====Jedi operations====\n[[File:Yoda_and_qui_gon.png|thumb|left|254x254px|Qui Gon Jinn and Yoda discuss a disturbance in the force.]]\nAt some point before [[32 BBY]], Jinn and Kenobi were operating near a [[Botor|planet]] that served as a base of the [[Flesh Mongers]] pirate group, flying a [[Qui-Gon Jinn's Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor|pair]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor|of]] [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor|Delta-7 ''Aethersprite''-class light interceptors]]. The two received a message from the planet's surface from Jedi Master [[Yoda]], who asked for assistance. Landing on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi discovered that Yoda had taken out the entire pirate gang to rescue a young Force-sensitive [[Youngling|child]], known as [[Lo]], as the pirate had planned to sell him due to his Force abilities.<ref name=\"Star Wars 26\">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref>\n\nYoda asked Jinn and Kenobi to escort the infant to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]], with Yoda assuring Lo that he was in safe hands with Jinn. Jinn expressed that he was happy to help out as they had been so close. While the two conversed, Kenobi took particular interest in that Yoda took out an entire room of pirates and was totally in awe. Jinn then proceeded to ask Yoda if everything was all right, to which the revered master replied that he could sense a calling [[disturbance in the Force]] that he felt he must follow. Jinn noted that he could not feel the presence himself but offered to join him on his quest if he so wanted. As Yoda climbed into his [[Yoda's Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor|starship]], he responded that he felt it was simply a calling for him alone and embarked on a [[Mission to unidentified planet (Yoda)|mission]] to [[Unidentified planet (Vagadarr system)|a planet]] in the [[Vagadarr system]], where he became involved in a [[War on unidentified planet (Vagadarr system)|tribal war]] between the planet's native inhabitants.<ref name=\"Star Wars 26\" />\n\n[[File:Jedi_on_Oosalon.jpg|thumb|right|238px|Qui-Gon Jinn, alongside Plo Koon and Depa Billaba on Oosalon.]]\nAt another point, Jinn&mdash;alongside Jedi Masters [[Mace Windu]], [[Plo Koon]], and [[Depa Billaba]]&mdash;was sent to the planet [[Oosalon]] by Supreme Chancellor [[Finis Valorum]] due to the actions of the [[warlord]] [[Guattako]], who was backed by the [[Hutt Clan]] and had kidnapped children to serve as soldiers. Being a planet that had around 80,000 [[kilometer]]s worth of tunnels, the Jedi would be unable to find the base of [[Guattako's army]], so they made a plan that Windu would be purposely captured, allowing him to send a signal in the Force to lead his fellow Jedi to Guattako. Although Jinn and his fellow Jedi&mdash;joined by at least two soldiers&mdash;were unable to make it through the tunnels in time to help Windu, the Jedi Master had nevertheless defeated Guattako's army, while the warlord himself had been shot by one of the children he had kidnapped. Thus, Guattako's revolution was thwarted, the children could be return to their homes, and the remaining members of the terrorist army were captured.<ref name=\"The Weapon\">{{Shortstory|story=The Weapon|book=Age of Republic Special 1}}</ref>\n\n===War on Naboo===\n====Failed negotiations====\n{{Quote|Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?''\"<br />\"''No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn|audio=TrivialTradeDispute-TPM.ogg|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\nTen years prior to the [[First Battle of Geonosis|outbreak]] of the [[Clone Wars]], the [[Trade Federation]] [[blockade]]d [[Naboo]] and planned to [[Invasion of Naboo|invade]] it in retaliation for the [[Galactic Republic]]'s taxation of [[Free Trade Zone|trade routes]] in outlying [[star]] systems. Unknown to the Republic, the [[Darth]] Sidious&mdash;secretly Naboo's [[Senator]] Palpatine&mdash;controlled the Federation and engineered the conflict so he could be elected Supreme Chancellor.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Before the blockade, Jinn felt that something was amiss and took Kenobi to the [[Jedi Archives]] to read through Senate documents, as they often did whenever Jinn felt something was wrong in the Senate. While reviewing bills concerning the recent tax reforms, Obi-Wan grew listless and Jinn, sensing his apprentice's discomfort, asked him what he thought. Kenobi opined to Jinn that they had too much time on their hands and it was pointless to read the taxation bills. Qui-Gon looked up from the file he was reading and admonished Kenobi, telling him that it was a matter of perspective and that the most important thing to the people who submitted the bills was control. Jinn noted that there was a lot of control to lose between the planets and corporations involved in the tax dispute.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" />\n\nObi-Wan questioned why they were personally purviewing the bills, and Jinn replied that they were listening so they could act when they needed to. Obi-Wan teasingly asked if they would act with or without orders, which made Jinn smile, though the Jedi Master informed his apprentice that they were likely to be following orders. Kenobi quipped that, because they would be under the Council's alignment, they would be less likely to be involved in local labor disputes. Bothered by Kenobi's comment, Jinn rebuked that they would also be less likely to kick-start romances with the local nobility. The reference to Duchess Satine let Kenobi know better than to treat such things so trivially, and he changed the subject as they continued reading the taxation bills. Jinn's precautions proved useful as<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> Chancellor Finis Valorum dispatched Jinn and Kenobi to Naboo, tasking them with resolving the situation through [[diplomat]]ic means.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Uncovering-the-army.png|thumb|left|240px|Jinn and Kenobi uncover the Federation invasion force on the command ship.]]\nUpon arriving at the Trade Federation [[command ship]] ''[[Saak'ak]]'', Jinn and Kenobi were escorted into a conference room, where they were told that [[Viceroy of the Trade Federation|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] would greet them. As the Jedi were waiting, the Federation leaders contacted Darth Sidious, informing him that the Chancellor's [[ambassador]]s were [[Jedi Knight]]s. Sidious ordered their execution, while Jinn could sense the fear that the [[Neimoidian]]s felt, letting Jinn know this wasn't a common trade dispute. These suspicions were confirmed when the Federation flooded the conference room with [[Dioxis|poison gas]] to kill the Jedi. But the two were able to hold their breath long enough for the Federation to open the doors and inadvertently give the Jedi a chance to [[Escape from the Saak'ak|escape]]. They fought off the [[battle droid]]s waiting outside the door and fled through the corridors, where they made their way into the ventilation system.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nMoving through the ventilation shafts, the Jedi made their way to the [[hangar]], where they saw the Federation Army preparing to mount an invasion of the planet. After Kenobi quipped that Jinn had predicted that the negotiations would be short, the Jedi stowed away aboard [[C-9979 landing craft|separate ships]], which made their way to the planet's surface and planned to warn the Naboo that the invasion was coming.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n====Rescuing the Queen====\n{{Quote|The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move here.

This encounter nearly got them killed as they fell to the ground just in [[time]] to avoid being run over by a Federation [[Multi-Troop Transport|troop carrier]]. Binks swore a [[life debt]] to Jinn for saving him, as Jinn tried to get rid of the Gungan. He finally rendezvoused with Kenobi and planned to find shelter, which Binks offered to give them in the [[Otoh Gunga|Gungan city]] beneath the [[ocean]]. The Gungan momentarily changed his mind, revealing that he had been [[Exile (punishment)|exiled]] and would be punished for returning; however, Jinn and Kenobi convinced him to take them there to avoid the approaching Federation forces.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nBinks led the two Jedi into the Gungan [[city]], where how they were immediately apprehended and brought before the [[Gungan High Council|Gungan leaders]]. Jinn attempted to persuade the Gungan leader, [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass|Nass]], that the Federation posed a threat to them just as much as they threatened Naboo. But Gungan prejudices against the [[Naboo (people)|Naboo]] were too strong for the Boss to care about what happened on the surface. The Jedi Master used the Force to [[Mind trick|telepathically]] persuade Nass to give them a [[Gungan bongo submarine|bongo]] [[Water|aquatic]] [[transport]] that the Jedi could use to reach [[Theed]], the capital of Naboo. Nass was also persuaded to allow Binks to travel with them, as Jinn, claiming the life debt custom, believed the Gungan could be a guide to make it through the planet core and to the capital.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAfter traveling through the core and evading multiple large sea creatures, they arrived in Theed and rescued [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], who was taken into Federation custody. Together, along with a number of the queen's [[Naboo Palace Guard|guards]] and [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaidens]], they made their way to a hangar to take the [[queen]]'s [[Naboo Royal Starship|starship]] off of Naboo. They were able to board the ship after fighting through many battle [[droid]]s and took the vessel into orbit where they encountered the Federation blockade. They managed to escape, but the ship was damaged and needed to be set down for repairs. Jinn suggested that they land on [[Tatooine]], a [[desert]] planet where the [[Hutt]]s ruled and the Federation had no presence. Although the queen's lead guard, [[Quarsh Panaka|Panaka]], objected because of the danger posed by the [[Hutt Clan|Hutts]], the decision was made to seek refuge on Tatooine.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n====Discovery of the Chosen One====\n{{Quote|Finding him was the will of the Force.

Jinn decided to venture out into [[Mos Espa|the local settlement]] to find a store that would sell a generator. He brought Amidala&mdash;masquerading as a royal handmaiden&mdash;and Binks along with him. While they were in town,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> everyone on the Royal Starship was left waiting for Jinn's return, leaving them to worry or read to pass the time.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\">''[[Queen's Shadow]]''</ref> Jinn, Amidala, and Binks arrived at a [[Watto's junkshop|shop]] owned by a [[Toydarian]] [[junk dealer]], [[Watto]], who had the parts they needed but would not accept Republic [[credit]]s for payment. Jinn attempted to persuade him that credits would be acceptable telepathically, but the Toydarian was immune to Jedi mind tricks. Jinn left empty-handed, but not before meeting [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young boy who was a [[Slavery|slave]] of Watto's.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nSkywalker followed Jinn and the others, where he warned them that a [[sandstorm]] was coming and that they would need to find shelter. The boy knew the group would not make it back to their ship in time and brought them back to his [[Skywalker home|home]], where he introduced them to his [[Parent|mother]], [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi]], who was also one of Watto's slaves. They all shared dinner, where Skywalker deduced that Jinn was a Jedi, having seen his [[Qui-Gon Jinn's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. Jinn revealed that he and the others were on a critical mission for the Republic and stranded on Tatooine until they could repair their ship. Knowing that it could help them escape, Skywalker volunteered to help by racing in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing|podrace]] and give them the profits to repair their ship if he won. Jinn accepted the offer, though Amidala was unconvinced that trusting their fate to someone they barely knew was the right course.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nThe next [[Standard day|day]], Jinn spoke to Watto about entering Skywalker in the race with [[Anakin Skywalker's Podracer|a]] [[Podracer|pod]] that Skywalker had built in secret, and Jinn convinced Watto that it was the Jedi's pod. The two agreed that Watto would pay Skywalker's entry fee and collect all of the winnings from a potential victory, except for whatever money Jinn needed to repair his ship. If Skywalker lost, Watto would keep the queen's ship. Watto agreed to the condition, and Skywalker set out to begin getting his pod race-ready.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nIn watching Skywalker work on his pod, Jinn told Shmi he could sense a Jedi's potential in the boy. Jinn wondered who Skywalker's father was and was intrigued to hear Shmi had conceived her son without a father. Later that night, Jinn tested the boy's midi-chlorian count and sent the sample to Kenobi on the queen's ship, who told his master that Skywalker's midi-chlorian count was over 20,000\u2014higher than any known Jedi. Through the supposed virgin [[Reproduction|birth]] and the midi-chlorian count, Jinn came to believe that Skywalker was the [[Chosen One]] of Jedi prophecy, a being who would bring balance to the Force and stop the [[Sith]].<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nWith the belief that Skywalker was the Chosen One, Jinn knew that he should bring Skywalker to the [[Jedi temple]] on Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi. Jinn approached Watto with a new wager: if the boy were to win, Watto would free Skywalker and his mother. Watto scoffed at the idea of freeing two slaves, but he did agree to release one if Skywalker won. However, he left it up to chance and threw a small multi-[[color]]ed [[Chance cube|cube]]; if it landed on blue, Skywalker would be the slave in question. Jinn [[Telekinesis|used]] the Force to help it land on blue, and Watto agreed to free Skywalker if he won the race\u2014but, according to Watto, the [[Dug]] [[Podracer (profession)|racer]] [[Sebulba]] was sure to win.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Maul_duels_Jinn.png|thumb|right|240px|Jinn fights Darth Maul on Tatooine, the first known encounter between Jedi and Sith for a thousand years.]]\nThe race began later that day, and Skywalker emerged victoriously. Watto, who lost everything betting on Sebulba, freed the boy as per their agreement. Jinn took what profits he needed to repair the ship, gave the rest to Skywalker and his mother, and told them that Skywalker had been freed and could go with him to Coruscant to become a Jedi. Skywalker was unsure about leaving his mother, but he always had [[dream]]ed of becoming a Jedi and decided to go. After Skywalker shared a tearful goodbye with his mother, Jinn and the boy set off for the queen's ship to make their way to Coruscant.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nJust before arriving at the ship, [[Maul|Darth Maul]], a Sith [[Lord]] and Darth Sidious' [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] attacked Jinn. The two [[Duel on Tatooine|fought]] across the desert floor while Skywalker rushed back to the ship to get help, and the ship made its way to Jinn's location, where he was able to board it and flee Tatooine, leaving Darth Maul behind. Once onboard, he introduced Skywalker to Kenobi.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nWith its [[hyperdrive]] repaired, the ship finally arrived on Coruscant, where Chancellor Valorum and Senator Palpatine greeted the crew. After arriving, Jinn went before the Jedi Council and told the Jedi Masters that he believed Darth Maul was a Sith Lord. The Council was dubious of the claim, as the Order thought they [[Jedi-Sith War|destroyed]] the Sith a [[millennium]] earlier, but they committed themselves to learn Darth Maul's identity. Jinn also revealed that he discovered Skywalker on Tatooine and believed him to be the Chosen One, asking that the boy be trained as a Jedi. At Jinn's request, the Council agreed to test Skywalker to determine if he was eligible for training. Kenobi was skeptical that Skywalker would pass the test given his age, as Jedi began their training at infancy, and worried that Jinn would defy whatever decision the Council made. Despite his Padawan's concerns, Jinn was determined to see Skywalker become a Jedi Knight.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nThe Council tested Skywalker and agreed with Jinn that he was mighty with the Force, but declined to accept him for training. They believed that he was too old to begin training and dangerously full of fear and anger despite his power.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Nonetheless, Jinn insisted that Skywalker receive training, saying he would take the boy as his Padawan learner. Meanwhile, Kenobi could take his [[Jedi Trials]] and become a Jedi Knight, as the Jedi Code forbade a Jedi from having two Padawans. The Council delayed the discussion for another time and ordered that Jinn and Kenobi return to Naboo as Queen Amidala was preparing to return to deal with the invasion without the [[Galactic Senate|Senate's]] help. Jinn took Skywalker with him and began giving him some initial lessons about the Force.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n====The Duel of the Fates====\n{{Quote|Obi-Wan.

There, the Naboo and Gungans allied to fight the Federation. The queen's handmaiden Padm\u00e9 revealed herself to be the true Amidala, having masqueraded as a servant while one of her handmaidens, [[Sab\u00e9]], portrayed the queen as a safety precaution.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Jinn, for his part, had not been fooled by the Queen's disguise since their first meeting but had gone along with the charade for reasons of his own, which she appreciated as it helped safeguard her life.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" /> Together with the Jedi and the Gungans, Amidala put together a plan of [[Battle of Naboo|attack]], where the Gungans would fight the [[Trade Federation Droid Army|Federation army]] away from Theed as a diversion, allowing Amidala, her forces, and the Jedi to infiltrate the city with little opposition. Jinn made it clear, however, that while he would protect the queen, he could not fight a war for her.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Qui-Gon's_death.png|thumb|left|220px|Darth Maul stabs Jinn through the torso, fatally wounding him.]]\nAs the [[Gungan Grand Army|Gungan army]] led the bulk of the Federation forces away from the city, Jinn snuck into Theed with the others and fought their way to the palace. Once in the hangar, they were again confronted by Darth Maul, who the two Jedi prepared to fight as the Naboo fought their way to the [[throne]] [[Throne room (Theed Royal Palace)|room]] to capture [[Viceroy]] Gunray. Jinn and Kenobi [[Lightsaber duel|fought]] Maul in the hangar, with the Sith Lord dominating the duel, though Maul did give ground to lead the Jedi out of the hangar and throughout a [[Theed power generator|palace generator complex]]. Maul separated the two Jedi by knocking Kenobi down several levels and eventually trapping him behind shielding, leaving Jinn to fight the Sith Lord in single [[Lightsaber combat|combat]] without his apprentice. As they made their way through the area, the two combatants were evenly matched. However, Maul eventually countered Jinn with a physical strike from his lightsaber hilt and seized the opportunity since Jinn was off-balance, fatally stabbing the Jedi Master through the torso as Kenobi watched in horror from behind the shielding.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nWhen Kenobi finally reached Maul, he and the Sith Lord engaged in a furious battle, with Kenobi grieving for his master and friend. Maul was able to disarm and knock Kenobi partly down a [[reactor]] shaft and kick his lightsaber into it. Then Kenobi used the Force to summon his master's lightsaber, jump out of the pit, and slice the blade through Maul's torso in one swift movement, cutting him in half and sending him tumbling down the shaft.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Nevertheless, it was too late to save Qui-Gon through medical intervention; no amount of [[bacta]] could heal the maverick Jedi's mortal wound.<ref name=\"Skywalker: AFaW\">''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''</ref> The Padawan ran to his dying master, cradling him in his arms, and Jinn made his apprentice promise that he would train with Skywalker as a Jedi.

Although Yoda disagreed, the Council approved Kenobi's request, fulfilling Jinn's dying wish: Skywalker would undergo Jedi training. Later,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Jinn was memorialized<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" /> when he was given a Jedi [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|funeral]] on Naboo, where his body was [[Cremation|cremated]] on a [[funeral]] pyre. Many delegates, including Queen Amidala, the Jedi Council, and Chancellor Palpatine, attended the funeral. At the funeral, Kenobi told Skywalker that the Council would allow him to be trained and that Kenobi would be his master. Together, the two mourned the death of their fallen friend, as Kenobi vowed that Skywalker would become a Jedi.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Amongst the Jedi, Jinn was remembered as a great member of their Order<ref name=\"AoR Dooku\" /> despite his past of disgreeing with the council.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nEven though he had always wanted Jinn available as guidance for when he eventually trained a Padawan,<ref name=\"AoR Obi-Wan\" /> and he had wanted time between his apprenticeship and eventual mentorship to decide what kind of Jedi he should be without Jinn by his side,<ref name=\"There is Always Another\">{{Shortstory|story=There Is Always Another|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> Kenobi upheld his vow to his master dutifully over the years. At one point, when Skywalker was considering leaving the Jedi Order [[29 BBY|at the age of twelve]], Kenobi was intent on following suit. However, he was still going to complete the boy's training even outside the Order. Skywalker, however, chose to remain a Jedi in the aftermath of a [[Mission to Carnelion IV|mission]] to the planet [[Carnelion IV]].<ref name=\"OW & A\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 5|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 5]]</ref> Even though Kenobi could become easily annoyed by Skywalker&mdash;leaving him to question if he had ever annoyed Jinn in similar ways, although he doubted he ever had&mdash;he nevertheless befriended<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" /> and grew close to his Padawan, with the Jedi duo coming to act like brothers.<ref name=\"Obi-Wan & Anakin\">''[[Choose Your Destiny: An Obi-Wan & Anakin Adventure]]''</ref>\n\nAlthough Skywalker remained thankful of Kenobi's teachings, he, at times, pondered how his life as a Jedi would have changed if Jinn had survived; even though he knew the Jedi Order disapproved of attachments, he thought these questions were alright because he believed nothing&mdash;not even interpersonal relationships&mdash;could ever be fully untethered.<ref name=\"Ahsoka\">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref> As Kenobi later recognized, Skywalker developed a habit of growing very connected to and not wanting to lose anyone he was close with after leaving his mother.

Later, on the planet [[Sullust]], Dooku unexpectedly reunited the Jedi Knight Jak'zin, who noted he had met Jinn before being interrupted by a represenative of the [[SoroSuub Corporation]]. Later, Dooku, appearing as if he could be compassionate ally, dicussed Jinn with the Jedi Knight. Dooku claimed he wondered if his former apprentice would still be alive if he had not left the order, reflecting that the company of Kenobi was not enough to save the late master. The Sith used his speculations to trick Jak'zin into letting him in on the Jedi's [[mission on Sullust]].<ref name=\"AoR Dooku\" />\n\n=====Effect on Naboo=====\n{{Quote|His name was Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi.

In the years following the Naboo Crisis, she remained saddened by his death, and she made sure to light a candle of incense for the fallen Jedi during the yearly memorial for all who had died for Naboo. In fact, many others did the same; though few on Naboo had met the Jedi Master, it was believed everyone on the world knew his name, with Naboo like [[Tonra]]&mdash;who had actually been present for many of the so-called \"stories\" about what had happened&mdash;hearing tales of what he did for their planet.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\n[[File:AgeofRepublic-PadmeCoverArt.jpg|300x330px|left|thumb|Honoring him as a hero, Padm\u00e9 Amidala remained saddened over Jinn's death, hoping that they could have been true friends.]]\nNevertheless, events like Jinn's time on Tatooine were not part of public record, so they were not spread amongst the Naboo. However, Tonra and Sab\u00e9 discussed such events during a mission to the desert world. Ultimately, the people of Naboo honored Jinn as a hero who had given everything to save them. Several years after the invasion, when Amidala was asked if she would become Naboo's Galactic Senator after her term as queen ended, she looked to the Handmaiden [[Sach\u00e9]]; the Handmaiden remembered when Jinn asked them to go to Coruscant, given that Amidala had have to give a similar wordless signal to her allies.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\nHaving met Jedi, Amidala was unique amongst her colleagues in the Senate, but she nevertheless found the manners of the Jedi Order unsettling. She considered that her reaction to their ways may have ended up different if Jinn had survived. While speaking with Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa]], she told him about Jinn, feeling a great sadness wash over herself while she explained his fate. Organa responded that he was sorry for her loss, further stating that he realized Jinn's death was an example of the dangerous life that followed her.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\nFor a mission to the planet [[Bromlarch]], Amidala and several other senators partnered with Jedi Master Depa Billaba, whom the former queen recognized due to her being present at Jinn's funeral. While she found it odd to interact with a Jedi Knight once more, Amidala also noticed Billaba carried herself very differently from how Jinn had. While she understood all Jedi in their Order would be different, she could not let go of the strange feeling it gave her, as if Billaba looked through her, while Jinn had taken the time to look at her. Soon afterward, Amidala met the liaison [[Ninui]]; given that it was the first time the liaison was meeting a Jedi, Amidala noted how she had met Kenobi and Jinn, explaining that the Jedi were people like them, albeit people whose teachings could be confusing to non-Force-sensitives, and Ninui noted she wished to hear the complete story of how she met them.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\n====Surviving as a spirit====\nThough his training had been incomplete, Jinn utilized what he learned from the Force Priestesses to become one with the Force and retain his identity after his death.

When Kenobi questioned how Jinn could appear, the figure told him that the planet acted as an amplifier and that it was a conduit through which the Force flowed. The two spoke about Skywalker and his power, with Kenobi having the opportunity to tell Jinn that the late Jedi Master's predictions about Skywalker were true: he was stronger than any other Jedi, yet still could not find balance.

He guided him to [[Dagobah]], the first leg on Yoda's trials, to determine whether he was ready to learn the secrets. Jinn told Yoda about his training and how the Living Force fed into the Cosmic Force, allowing him to return after death. At first, Yoda was only interested in the Clone Wars' truth, asking if he knew the identity of Darth Sidious, but Jinn could only guide Yoda through his trials.

Kenobi asked for his guidance, as he feared that the [[Galactic Empire]] would capture Luke upon his return to the Lars Homestead. Already knowing the circumstances Kenobi was speaking of, Jinn informed him that he had seen Luke's destiny go beyond the current event, listing off possible solutions that would occur, while the surrounding landscape became clearer to him. He spotted the corpses of [[jawa]]s, feeling the memory of their deaths wash over him, but was slightly comforted when he noticed R2-D2 and C-3PO; he believed it was the work of the Force, bringing them back to where Anakin's journey had begun.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\n[[File:Right-before-Qui-Gon.png|250px|thumb|right|When Luke Skywalker rushed off to save his uncle and aunt, Obi-Wan Kenobi called out to Jinn for guidance.]]\nThe news that Luke would survive relieved Kenobi, yet Jinn knew his former apprentice had no idea how the young man's journey would unfold. When Kenobi confided in him that he found it difficult to give up his exile, Jinn understood it was a symptom of him adapting to the new life, informing him that he would quickly feel like a Jedi Knight when the time came. He also congratulated his former student on remaining steadfast in his devotion to the light side. He also apologized to Kenobi, believing he had failed his Padawan long ago when he made him train Anakin. Kenobi disagreed, arguing that Anakin was the main person at fault for his fall, but Jinn resolved to wait to discuss this matter, knowing that the two of them would be together in the Force soon;<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> in the near future, Kenobi would [[Rescue of Princess Leia|sacrifice]] himself to save Luke and be struck down by Darth Vader,<ref name=\"Episode IV\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> and Jinn knew this was coming.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nJinn and Kenobi then both felt Luke's horror at seeing his aunt and uncle, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]] and Owen Lars, dead outside their home. Even so, Kenobi sensed Luke's reaction at a greater remove, while Jinn, due to him being of the Force, could see their burned corpses in front of him, as clearly as he could see Kenobi. Thinking his former Padawan needed guidance, he then told Kenobi that he had made the right choice in choosing not to tell Luke everything about Anakin; he knew Luke could have gone down his father's path if Kenobi had revealed everything, or he could have thought Owen was right about Kenobi being insane, which would have resulted in him being killed with his aunt and uncle. After telling Kenobi to wait to reveal the truth until Luke was ready, Kenobi brought forth notice upon Jinn's appearance, which was very nearly corporeal. Jinn illuminated him in some of the ways he had managed it, all the while, considering that Kenobi did not have long to live. Sensing that Luke would soon return, he bade farewell, telling Kenobi that they would meet again soon. His former student did not understand the true meaning of the statement, and Jinn disappeared, returning to the Force.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\n[[File:Jotr-macewindu-2-40thvariant.png|thumb|left|300x330px|Qui-Gon Jinn knew that his former apprentice would fall to Darth Vader aboard the Death Star.]]\nOn the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station]], Kenobi was indeed killed by Darth Vader to protect Luke.<ref name=\"Episode IV\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> After his death, Kenobi found himself overwhelmed by visions of the past, present, and future; among the people he saw was Jinn, including when he was slain by Maul and when his voice told him to protect Luke<ref name=\"Time of Death\" /> in 16 BBY.<ref name=\"Time of Death flashback date\" /> While worried about not completing Luke's training as he lived through his past, relived the present, and saw glimpses of the future, Kenobi again heard that Luke had called out to him on the Death Star; hearing Jinn's voice, louder than it had been for years, telling him to go with Luke, Kenobi ensured his spirit would remain with the Jedi trainee. Thus,<ref name=\"Time of Death\" /> after his death, Kenobi first appeared as a disembodied voice, telling Luke to flee the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] with his friends, and then later to guide Luke through the [[Battle of Yavin]], helping the young Force-sensitive to destroy the Death Star.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nYoda, meanwhile, had hidden himself on Dagobah, staying away from the Empire but also growing lonely over the years. Fortunately, he knew how to call out to Jinn for company. One of the few personal ideas Yoda brought with him was Jinn's cloak, which he made into his blanket. Around the time of Kenobi's death, Yoda was preparing to move to the lowlands of Dagobah for the dry season, and he found himself questioning how long ago Jinn had died when he counted his personal ideas for the journey. He also realized that, while people strong in the Force could sometimes leave an imprint of themselves in what they owned, too many years had gone by for any trace of the Jedi Master to remain in the cloak, if he had ever felt such a trace at all. As he always did, he gathered his cane, several seeds, a pot made by Kenobi, and Jinn's cloak before making his way down to his lowland hut.<ref name=\"There is Another\">{{Shortstory|story=There is Another|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\nAs he journeyed, he felt Kenobi and Vader's duel in the Force, taking his focus away as an old Imperial [[probe droid]] finally located him. After throwing Kenobi's pot into the droid to destroy it, he sensed Kenobi's death, distracting him as two other probes appeared. One fired and hit Yoda's carrying bag, which he rushed to to protect Jinn's cloak from burning. After taking out the droids, he saw that the cloak was only slightly singed and that his seeds were fine. Afterward, Jinn, currently in the [[netherworld of the Force]], laughed at Yoda, which the Jedi Master sensed. Once Yoda moved back into his lowland hut, he trimmed the cloak, which also meant it better compensated for his shrinking size. Several days after his move, Yoda, missing the friends he had lost, called out to Jinn to appear from the netherworld several times, only to be unable to sense him.<ref name=\"There is Another\" />\n\nJinn was in fact preoccupied, so Kenobi instead appeared. During his visit, Kenobi quipped that Yoda's encounter with the probe droids could not have been too dangerous, given that he had saved Jinn's cloak, annoying Yoda. Afterward, Kenobi asked him to train Luke, which Yoda reluctantly agreed to.<ref name=\"There is Another\" />\n\n====The lives and times of Luke and Rey====\n{{Quote|We stand behind you, Rey.|Qui-Gon speaks to Rey|Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker}}\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, Vader was [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|shot down]] over the planet [[Vrogas Vas]].

Through the training Yoda gave Luke, the boy confronted and [[Battle of Endor|redeemed]] his father from the dark side, and Anakin killed Darth Sidious. Through this act and his own death, Anakin helped defeat the Galactic Empire, brought balance to the Force, and was able to return as a spirit as well. By killing Sidious and sacrificing himself, Jinn's strongly-held belief was finally proven right; Anakin Skywalker was the Chosen One.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nIn the [[New Republic Era|years following]] Anakin's redemption and fulfillment of the prophecy, Luke embarked on a quest to rediscover the Jedi Order's forgotten history in hopes to re-establish it. In his search for Jedi knowledge, Luke learned about the life of Jinn, his relationship with Obi-Wan Kenobi, his encounter with the Force Priestesses, and the role he played in his father's training. While Jinn was not related to the Skywalkers by blood, his close connection to the family was noted by Luke in his [[book]] ''[[The Secrets of the Jedi]]'', which chronicled the Jedi Order's history.<ref name=\"TSotJ\">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Jedi]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[35 ABY]], during the [[Battle of Exegol]], [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] heard Jinn's voice among the voices of many Jedi of the past who aided her with destroying the resurrected Darth Sidious for good. \"Every Jedi who ever lived lives in you,\" he told her, adding that they stood behind her.<ref name=\"Episode IX\">[[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n===Ideals and spirituality===\n====A unique Jedi====\n{{Quote|Do not defy the Council, Master, not again.''\"<br />\"''I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn|audio=IShallDoWhatIMust-TPM.ogg|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\nQui-Gon Jinn was a human male who stood 1.93 [[meter]]s tall<ref name=\"SWEQui-GonJinn\" /> and had light skin, blue [[eye]]s,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> and long,<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" /> brown [[hair]], along with a brown beard. Though he had risen to the rank of Jedi Master, Jinn did not always agree with the structures and rules of the Jedi Order. Jinn was known to disobey the Jedi Code if he felt he needed to and was willing to rebuff the Jedi Council.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Furthermore, Jinn was different in his view of attachments when compared to other Jedi; he believed you could still love others as long as you were not possessive,<ref name=\"Together Again Download\" /> whereas other Jedi feared any attachment could lead to that.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> While he knew the Force could often present more questions than answers, he nevertheless trusted in it and its guidance.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\n[[File:AoR-QuiGonJinn-B-textless.png|thumb|left|300x330px|Qui-Gon Jinn was different from his fellow Jedi, having his own views on the Force that could conflict with the opinions of his peers.]]\nWhile other Jedi focused on meditation to try to understand the future, Jinn lived in the moment.<ref name=\"SWEQui-GonJinn\" /> He believed that one's focus on the future shouldn't compromise their concentration on the present and believed in trusting one's instincts.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Although he was unconcerned whenever someone claimed he was a coward, Jinn came to have a distaste for how many people, even people on Coruscant, saw the Jedi as warriors and political servants. Although Yoda simply thought that people who could not use the Force would be confused by those who could, Jinn was faced with a great turmoil due to his concerns, as he understood that the Jedi Order's actions reflected who they really were. While the Jedi Council would disagree with his assessment, Jinn believed that the Jedi being based on Coruscant was part of the problem, as it enabled them to become and be seen as a force that served the Republic, even possibly making themselves believe it.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\nInstead of focusing on what he had expected out of situations, Jinn decided it was best to focus on what actually was happening.<ref name=\"Life Day\" /> Jinn took the time to truly look at and understand the people he worked with. In the case of Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, she reflected that he had, at times, looked too deeply into her; Jinn realized that she had swapped places with one of her Handmaidens, making him one of the few people who was ever able to deduce the deception tactic. Keeping it a secret that he knew, he would address his questions to the fake queen, making those around them, like fellow Handmaiden Sach\u00e9, think he had been fooled. Ultimately, Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi taught Amidala that the Jedi were sentient beings like herself, even if she did not understand their teachings.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\nJinn often entered into debates with Jedi Master Mace Windu, but neither of them enjoyed those disagreements.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> Ultimately, Jinn could be described as being like a maverick when compared to his fellow Jedi. Although it was a rare viewpoint, he was not the only \"maverick\" Jedi during the late Republic Era, as Master [[Tu-Anh]] was also active in the Order. During the Clone Wars, Jinn's own apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, compared the two while overlooking Tu-Anh's body after her death.<ref name=\"A Death on Utapau\">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref>\n\n====Respect in prophecies and balance====\nAlthough the other Jedi of his era thought little of prophecies and argued that looking into the future could be dangerous and uncertain, Jinn respected the prophecies made by the Jedi mystics of old. Even though he had in his younger years, Jinn did not view prophecies to be literal. Nevertheless, he did not take them to be meaningless, and he felt that learning what the ancient mystics believed helped tie the Jedi Order to its history. Still, he did also know that trying to learn the future could be considered a form of control, which could lead to the dark side. Ultimately, he told Obi-Wan Kenobi that explaining his view of the prophecies was \"complex.\"<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n[[File:AoR-QuiGonJinn-C-textless.png|300x330px|thumb|right|Qui-Gon Jinn felt that, as a Jedi, he needed to find balance in the Force.]]\nTo Jinn, the ultimate purpose of the Jedi was to find balance. Although he once pondered whether the Force wanted him to learn from the dark side, he came to the conclusion that the dark side's corrupting nature made it so it could never create balance. Furthermore, he also believed that, if the Jedi Order acted too rigidly in its beliefs, it still could not achieve balance. Thus, he believed that the Jedi needed to make a compromise between both extremes; they could not bend to the dark side, yet they also could not become too rigid. Jinn used his understanding of balance to help the Priestess of Wood, Th'er, telling her how she could find compromise with people who had faced similar struggles to her, which would allow her to enrich her people while also preserving their culture.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\nSimilarly, Jinn displayed a great respect towards Wookiee culture. He saw that their connection to their homeworld was like a balance, further thinking that their Life Day celebrations were a celebration of the Force. He also respected the wisdom held by members of the Wookiee species, knowing that it could teach both him and his Padawan, Kenobi, many things. His understanding of Wookiee culture also helped in conventional problems; he knew it was odd for any Wookiee to be away from their family on Life Day, helping him to realize something was behind the disappearance of Balfus.<ref name=\"Life Day\" /> Even after his death and becoming part of the Force, he continued to respect balance and see it as necessary.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nMost Jedi did not share<ref name=\"Kylo Ren 4\">''[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 4]]''</ref> Jinn's beliefs about how they should act.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" /> Believing their rules made them stronger, the Jedi continued to use a seemingly endless series of rules and codes.<ref name=\"Kylo Ren 4\" /> Much like how Jinn had compared rigid rules to a tree branch that breaks off in the wind after refusing to accommodate it,<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" /> the rigid nature of the Jedi Order only helped to bring about its downfall<ref name=\"Kylo Ren 4\" /> at the end of the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Following his death, Jinn knew of how Owen and Beru Lars took in Luke Skywalker despite the risks of raising the boy; he considered them examples of pure heroism, becoming pained and horrified by their deaths.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\n====Beyond the world of the living====\n{{Quote|You're very nearly corporeal.

Hopefully in the distant future.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn|Master and Apprentice (short story)}}\nEven during his life, Jinn understood that the Force was larger than a single Jedi's connection to it, even believing it was larger than the concepts of life and death.<ref name=\"Life Day\" /> As part of the Living Force,<ref name=\"Voices\" /> Jinn was able to understand how every aspect of every environment played a part in the [[great song of the Whills]]; he saw that nothing was barren, as the Force existed within everything, even understanding how the desert of Tatooine was not truly barren, given everything that made it up.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nAlthough his identity had survived death,<ref name=\"Voices\" /> he no longer had an \"individual existence;\" no longer existing as \"Qui-Gon Jinn\" and instead existing as part of the Force, he was unconcerned with linear time, individuality, awareness, and consciousness, even existing beyond what he believed to be the \"crude\" language used by living humans. Although he thought being part of the Force was a better state, he nevertheless fondly, but distantly, remembered the vitality of his mortal life. He could leave his unity with the Force to commune with the living, yet such an action caused pain, making the definition of himself separate from the Force. Despite providing a vantage point for the complex physical universe, the pain of entering back into individual existence was only endurable to Jinn because he understood he could return to the Force quickly and because he knew he may be needed. He also found that using his old Padawan's name was worth separating from being one with the Force.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nExisting as a fracture of the Force, he understood that his past existence was best summarized by his name, given that it was who he was during his temporal life.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> Even after his death and return as a spirit, Jinn was confronted with Jedi thinking only of the future.{{Fact}} He guided Yoda through Dagobah to learn the secret of eternal consciousness; but, Yoda was interested in knowing if Jinn, existing outside of normal time, could tell him Darth Sidious's true identity. Although Jinn hinted that he knew the truth, he explained he could only guide Yoda towards greater knowledge, not provide him with the answers.<ref name=\"Voices\" />\n\n[[File:YodaDagobahLight.png|thumb|left|285px|Jinn's spirit explains to Yoda how the connection between the Living Force and Cosmic Force helped him retain his identity after death.]]\nJinn's training to retain his identity after death led him to new philosophies unknown to the Jedi Order at the time. Jinn learned that there were two sides to the Force, a Living Force channeled by the energies of all living beings, and the Cosmic Force into which it fed. It was this symbiotic relationship that allowed the Force to bind the galaxy together and speak to living beings through the midi-chlorians.<ref name=\"Voices\" />\n\nAfter learning how to manifest himself into the physical universe<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> instead of only existing as a voice,<ref name=\"Voices\" /> he could draw upon the memories of his life, using them to form into a shape that appeared like how his body had. He could feel everything, from his flesh to his robes, form around him; when he was summoned by Obi-Wan Kenobi after Luke Skywalker ran to see what had become of his aunt and uncle, Jinn found that removing his hood came naturally. He longer the remained in the physical universe, the easier he found it to use gestures to express himself.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nJinn thought that the most beautiful type of mastery was learning to let go, such as how Jedi like himself let go from the mortal universe. Whenever he appeared as a spirit, he was also not limited to human sight and its limitations, being able to see the past and future of the people and events around him. Appearing as a spirit required balance and devotion to the Force, with Jinn explaining he needed to both claim and detach himself from the mortal universe. It took nearly a decade of training to be able to enter such a state. The longer he remained in the mortal realm, the more corporeal he became. He was even able to smell the cremation of the Jawas.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nFinding human lives incredibly brief and death an inevitable&mdash;but almost a neutral&mdash;event, Jinn had come to believe that it was one's journey through the Force that mattered. Believing that truths always eventually came out, he was able to know what living people would call the future, as he no longer existed in linear time. When he appeared on Tatooine to speak with Kenobi, he felt the deaths of nearby Jawas, specifically feeling the memory of their helplessness and fear wash over his consciousness. Finding their deaths meaningless, Jinn was comforted by the sight of C-3PO and R2-D2, knowing it proved time to be a circle; the Force had ensured they were present once more on the desert world, making the beginning of a journey its end as well.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nJinn understood that he could never have understood the process of appearing as a spirit when he was alive. Whenever Jinn intended to return to the Force, his awareness spread out, again allowing him to sense how every aspect of a planet fit together to form the system of life. Upon letting go, he again would release his name and form to become one with<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> the energy field that was<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> the Force.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\n===Apprentice of Dooku===\nAfter Jinn's old master<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> and friend,<ref name=\"AoR Dooku\" /> Dooku, fell to the dark side and became the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, Dooku told Kenobi that he wished Jinn were still alive so the late Jedi Master could have helped him with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Kenobi rejected the idea that Jinn would have joined Dooku. Still, Dooku told Kenobi that Jinn knew about the corruption in the Galactic Senate and might have joined the Separatist cause\u2014especially if he had learned that the Republic was under Darth Sidious's control. However, Dooku did not tell Kenobi that the Separatists were also under Sith control.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n===Mentor to Obi-Wan Kenobi and empathetic nature===\n====Training the Jedi Padawan====\n{{Quote|You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan. And you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.|Qui-Gon Jinn, to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\nDuring his service to the Jedi Order, Jinn took on Obi-Wan Kenobi as his Padawan learner. Although they were able to work well together, both had major differences in their view of the Jedi; Kenobi was more willing to obey the orders of the Jedi Council,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> being willing to fill out detailed reports of their missions, while Jinn was willing to hold back on such duties, partly because he knew Kenobi would handle them,<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" /> and disobey the Council. Nevertheless, though he still did not entirely agree with it, he came to understand it was normal for Jinn to disagree with the Council, viewing his Master's actions as a viable alternative to their orders, as it avoided giving into absolutes. Even so, he always preferred to have advanced warning when they were to go on unapproved missions, at least because it allowed him to pack.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" />\n\nWith a Jedi Master who had a more \"relaxed\" attitude instead of a rigid reading of the [[Jedi Code]],<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" /> Kenobi understood that his lessons were often unconventional, but he did not display annoyance with that,<ref name=\"Life Day\" /> even if Jinn's attempts at moving him away from a standard Jedi viewpoint&mdash;asking Kenobi to embody the spirit of the Jedi Code instead of a literal reading&mdash;instead resulted in Kenobi trying even harder embody the traditional Jedi spirit.<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" /> Jinn nevertheless defended his unconventional choices, believing that Jedi could not learn new lessons if they only stuck with their specific teachings. Beyond thinking Kenobi was always well learned in his answers to questions, Jinn also truly trusted his Padawan; when he and many Wookiees were captured on Life Day, he trusted in Kenobi to rescue them.<ref name=\"Life Day\" /> He also felt sustained by Kenobi's strength.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\n[[File:JediMasterAndPadawan-TPM.png|250px|thumb|right|Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, master and apprentice]]\nJinn also tasked Kenobi with reading political bills with him whenever he got a feeling that something was wrong. While Kenobi was annoyed by how time consuming the process was, he respected that, and was further annoyed by how, his mentor's feelings on such matters were often correct. Beyond Jinn often being correct, the other reason he went along with it was because his only attempt at \"mutinying\" against such work it did not go over well.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> Like most Jedi, Kenobi also did not share his master's fascination with prophecies.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Despite their differences, which could make them argue even when they agreed on matters,<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> Jinn remained proud of Kenobi's accomplishments, believing his Padawan to be wiser than himself and foreseeing that his apprentice would become an great Jedi Knight. Kenobi was also thankful for his teachings<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> and, even despite his misgivings, would not give up their friendly arguments for anything.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" />\n\nBeyond being able to sense whenever his apprentice held discontentment,<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> Qui-Gon Jinn had an empathetic nature and tended to take unfortunate life forms under his protection. It was this tendency and his defiance towards the Jedi Council, which often frustrated and baffled his Padawan. When Jinn saved the Gungan exile Jar Jar Binks, who in turn swore a life-debt to him, his compassionate nature was such that Jinn took the hapless Gungan under his wing, much to Kenobi's dismay. His empathy toward all life forms, including the most pitiful and unfortunate, was Jinn's greatest strength.<ref name=\"Ultimate\" /> Additionally, he remained understanding and patient with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" /> During the short time they knew each other,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> he never asked for her to do more than she was willing to, and she was left in nearly overwhelming sadness anytime she thought of the Jedi Master after his death.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\nKenobi had sleepless nights during his training, partly because he feared Jinn would somehow end up removed from the Jedi Order before his apprenticeship was over. Kenobi had tried to embody a traditional Jedi spirit to keep his master in line with traditional teachings, a reverse of the typical master&mdash;apprentice relationship. Despite that,<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" /> some of Jinn's defiance was passed down to his Padawan, resulting in Kenobi pushing for Anakin to become his apprentice.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n====Remaining a mentor====\n{{Quote|Thank you, Qui-Gon. As always, your wisdom sustains me.''\"<br />\"''As your strength always sustained me.|Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon|Master and Apprentice (short story)}}\nEven after his death, Jinn continued to help his former Padawan; he gave him guidance during the Imperial Era, warning him whenever he needed to protect Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"Time of Death\" /> When he was called upon during his former student's exile, he did not only see Kenobi as he existed in old age, seeing every other aspect of the man's past and present at once and believing they all made him who he was. In fact, he completed his training to appear as a ghost for Kenobi, as he wanted him to have company throughout his exile. Finding that saying Kenobi's name made the effort to enter the physical universe worth it, he elected to also say \"Ben,\"<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> which served as Kenobi's alias.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> He also knew that Kenobi would quickly adopt the persona of a Jedi Knight once more, as soon as danger came, and looked forward to watching Kenobi do so.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nJinn also took to calling him \"my Padawan\" once more, as he knew Kenobi still had much to learn, as he had learned that death was merely the start of gaining wisdom. Even so, he believed Kenobi already personified the ways of the Jedi, seeing that he had the patience to remain on Tatooine as Luke Skywalker grew up. Although Kenobi did not see himself in a kind light, Jinn also knew Kenobi was special for not giving into the dark side during that time; he was in awe of Kenobi's steadfast devotion to the light, as he remained a Jedi despite losing everyone he loved. Beyond his mentor, Kenobi had lost Anakin, Satine Kryze, Padm\u00e9 Amidala,<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> and [[Clone Commander]] [[CC-2224]] \"Cody.\"<ref name=\"Ahsoka\" /> He also respected Kenobi's courage in wanting to continue to live despite all he had lost; he was moved by this, but he anticipated the upcoming reunion they would have after Kenobi's death.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nHe felt that respecting Kenobi's steadfast devotion to the Jedi was something he owed his Padawan because, upon reflection, Jinn also believed he had failed his student, thinking that Kenobi had not been ready to teach Anakin. He thought his mistakes were obvious and wretched, thinking that Kenobi never discussed them with him to spare his mentor needing to hear of them. In reality,<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> even though he did feel Anakin had been thrust upon him and did regret not having more time to figure out his place in the Jedi Order,<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" /> Kenobi never mentioned the supposed mistakes to his former master because he did not blame him for Anakin's fall. Jinn wanted to discuss these matters with Kenobi once they were both beyond the world of the living, and he agreed with his apprentice's decision to not tell Luke the full story about his father, thinking that the boy needed to learn when he was steady and strong in the Force.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\nKenobi felt sustained by his mentor's wisdom, looking forward to learning how to appear as a spirit and never hesitating to call upon Jinn. Whenever Jinn departed from the mortal world to return to the Force, he found that Kenobi became another part of the overall music of life. He intended to show Kenobi the beauty in letting go to be a part of the Force.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> By the time after his death, Kenobi had come to disagree with the way Jinn had taken Skywalker off Tatooine; the Jedi Master had told the boy he was not on planet to free him from slavery, instead suggesting he leave his mother for a prophecy he had never heard of.<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" />\n\n===Belief in Anakin Skywalker===\n[[File:5MinuteStories-Anakin-and-Qui-Gon.png|250px|thumb|left|Meeting the young boy Anakin Skywalker, Qui-Gon Jinn was certain he was the Chosen One.]]\nUnlike Kenobi,<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Jinn believed in the prophecy of the Chosen One, being certain that the foretold individual would bring balance to the Force.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Just as the prophecy foretold,<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Jinn came to meet a male born of no father, Anakin Skywalker, and he quickly came to believe he was the Chosen One. Though he acknowledged that Skywalker's future contained an uncertain destiny, he did not dwell on the danger the Council saw in Skywalker's potential. He was willing to train him even if the council forbade in. Even in his dying deaths, Jinn remained steadfast in his belief.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nEven as a spirit, Jinn continued to believe in Skywalker, quickly asking Kenobi whether he had trained him when they reunited on Mortis. Although he briefly entertained the thought that Skywalker was not the Chosen One, warning Kenobi that the planet was nevertheless dangerous for Skywalker even if he was not,<ref name=\"Overlords\" /> he later affirmed his faith in the young Jedi and his destiny while speaking to him.<ref name=\"GhostsMortis\" /> Skywalker and Kenobi later came to believe their discussions with Jinn's spirit on Mortis were deceptions,<ref name=\"Voices\" /> but it had truly been their old mentor.<ref name=\"CVD\" />\n\nAfter Skywalker fell to the dark side, Jinn saw it as a fate worse than death. He blamed himself for the creation of Darth Vader, believing that he had placed the responsibility for training him on Kenobi before his student was ready. He concluded that training the boy may have been impossible for even the best of the Jedi, yet Kenobi disagreed, arguing that Skywalker&mdash;even if himself and Jinn had some blame for his fate&mdash;had all the wisdom needed to take the path of the light side, yet he chose otherwise. Despite agreeing with Kenobi's response, he did not feel his mistakes were absolved.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Show yourself, can you?''\"<br />\"''I cannot.

He utilized [[telekinesis]] and [[mind trick]]s on more than one occasion, using them to help further his goals during the Trade Federation's occupation of Naboo and while attempting to free Skywalker from slavery.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> He was also skilled in the ability of Force jump, being able to use it to leap high into the air.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" />\n\nJinn was skilled with a lightsaber, able to use his blade to easily defeat battle droids on Naboo and hold his own in his first duel with Darth Maul. However, he was not skilled enough to survive his second encounter with Darth Maul, as the Sith Lord out-fought the Jedi Master and mortally wounded him after a prolonged fight.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAlthough Jinn fell at the hands of Maul,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> his influence remained present in his former apprentice Kenobi as well as his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. When Kenobi and Skywalker confronted Dooku on his ship during the Clone Wars, the Sith Lord noted that he had to be wary of their knowledge and skill since they had been taught by Jinn, who at one point had been his Padawan.<ref name=\"Dooku Captured story\" />\n\nThe ability to manifest consciousness after death was, for a time, a skill that other Jedi didn't know. Jinn kept his training with the Force Priestesses a secret, and the Jedi Order continued to believe that death was permanent and one couldn't retain their identity. It was not until towards the Clone Wars that Jinn revealed himself to Yoda, despite his training being incomplete at the time, and Jinn told the Jedi Master that he too could learn to return from death through the Cosmic Force.<ref name=\"Voices\" /> In this state, Jinn's connection to the Force was not hampered by a physical body; he was of the Force, so could see possibilities and what was occurring in multiple locations at once. As such, he could sense events before they happened. Jinn passed his teachings<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\" /> on to Yoda and Kenobi, who used it and the new philosophies they learned to help guide Luke Skywalker towards his destiny.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n===Tools and clothing===\n[[File:AoR-QuiGonJinn-art.jpg|thumb|left|300x330px|A member of the Jedi Order, Qui-Gon Jinn wore robes and wielded a lightsaber.]]\nLike his fellow Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn wore the Jedi robes typical of his era, including an optional hooded robe that could easily be removed.

Jinn also used a [[comlink]] for long distance communication, owned an [[imagecaster]] to display holograms, and used a [[rebreather]] when swimming underwater.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nJinn flew a blue Delta-7 ''Aethersprite''-class light interceptor, which could be attached to a [[hyperspace transport ring]] for [[lightspeed]] travel. Furthermore, his starfighter travels were aided by an astromech droid that had a round dome. For their mission to Bri'n, Kenobi and Jinn used a ''Eta''-class shuttle.<ref name=\"AoR-Q-GJ1\" /> During the Invasion of Naboo, Kenobi, Jar Jar Binks, and him were given a Gungan bongo submarine to travel through Naboo's planet core.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n===Lightsaber===\n{{Main|Qui-Gon Jinn's lightsaber}}\n[[File:Qui-Gon_Jinns_lightsaber_-_SW_Card_Trader.png|thumb|right|250px|Jinn's lightsaber was less ornate than that of his Master.]]\nThe Jedi Master wielded a green lightsaber with a ridged handgrip that contained a series of micro-power cells, allowing for more control of current charge levels.
