Have you lost weight? Love the new hairstyle.''\"<br />\"''Two years without so much as a holo, and that's all you can say? You abandoned me at our ''wedding''!|Doc and Prudy|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Prudy''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Lethan]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] who worked as a [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]]. She became engaged to a fellow doctor named [[Archiban Frodrick Kimble|Archiban Kimble]] on the planet [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] in [[3644 BBY]], but Kimble&mdash;better known as Doc&mdash;ended their relationship just before their [[Marriage/Legends|wedding]] and left her with the [[Prudy's hospital|refugee hospital]] he had bought for her on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. [[3642 BBY|Two]] [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later, Prudy was kidnapped by a [[Unidentified criminal gang|group of criminals]] so they could blackmail Doc into delivering a shipment of valuable [[Spice/Legends|spice]] that he had failed to give them, and the [[Gangster/Legends|gangsters]] burned her [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]] to the ground before she was rescued.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|My parents flew all the way from Coruscant for a wedding that never happened. You loathsome cad!

The two began a relationship and soon became [[Marriage/Legends|engaged]], and Doc purchased Prudy a [[Prudy's hospital|refugee hospital]] on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] using [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] that he had stolen from a [[Unidentified criminal gang|gang of criminals]] after scamming them with a false promise of a [[Spice/Legends|spice]] delivery. However, Prudy rushed their relationship and arranged a wedding before Doc was ready, causing him to break off their engagement just before the ceremony even after [[Prudy's mother|her mother]] and [[Prudy's father|father]] arrived from Coruscant.<ref name=\"Best\" />\n\nPrudy spent the next two [[Standard year/Legends|years]] running her [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]] on Alderaan, and Doc did not contact her that entire time until the gang that Doc had scammed tracked down where their funds had gone. Learning that Prudy's hospital had been purchased with their credits, in [[3642 BBY]] the gang took the Twi'lek hostage and burned the hospital to the ground before contacting Doc with a ransom demand: Prudy's life in return for the spice he owed them. Doc was able to secure Prudy's release by taking her place as the gang's hostage, though he managed to escape with the help of the [[Republic Customs Office]] and its hostage negotiators. Prudy later contacted Doc via [[Holocomm/Legends|holocomm]] and expressed her fury to him, and she terminated the transmission in anger after informing him that the [[Gangster/Legends|gangsters]] had destroyed her hospital.<ref name=\"Best\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Prudy's a wonderful girl. Someday, she'll make a boring proper gentleman very happy. Ol' Doc just isn't the settling type.|Doc|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nA trained doctor who ran a refugee hospital, Prudy was a [[Color/Legends|reddish-pink]]-skinned<ref name=\"Best\" /> [[Lethan]]<ref name=\"Visual\" /> Twi'lek with yellow [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] whose two [[Lekku/Legends|lekku]] sported a pattern of dark lines. Prudy was too clingy in her relationships for Doc's taste, and her speedy planning of a wedding led the commitment-wary Doc to end their engagement. She held a grudge against Doc for his departure, and the fact that he did not contact her and that his actions caused the destruction of her hospital did nothing to lessen the anger she felt toward him.<ref name=\"Best\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|If every man was judged by his ex-girlfriends, we'd all serve life sentences without hope of parole.|Doc|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nPrudy first appeared as a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', a [[video game]] released by [[BioWare]] and [[LucasArts]] in [[2011]], in which she is featured in the conversation \"Best Intentions\" with the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] class companion Doc. The conversation was originally a full mission that would have included the player accompanying Doc to Alderaan to rescue Prudy from the pirate [[Cazzush]] in an old Imperial base on Alderaan, but that version was cut from the game before its release.<ref name=\"Best\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Healers and doctors]]\n[[Category:Lethan Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
