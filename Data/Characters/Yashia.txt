There was another acolyte not too long ago who entered this tomb and did not come back. [...] I just thought it would be nice if somebody took his body back and told his father he didn't make it.|Yashia|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Yashia''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Imperial soldier]] who served under the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|resurgent Sith Empire]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]. In [[3643 BBY]], she was stationed on [[Korriban]], guarding the entrance to the [[Tomb of Naga Sadow]]. She asked an [[Sith Acolyte|acolyte]] to recover the body of another fallen [[Naman Fal's son|acolyte]], the son of [[Imperial Guard|Dark Honor Guard]], [[Naman Fal]]. The fallen acolyte was recovered and Naman Fal was informed about his fallen son while he stood guard at the Dark Council chambers.\n\n==Personality==\n{{Quote|The Acolyte who went in there, he - he was a good sort. Friendly and talkative. He said he was entering the tomb to prove himself to his father.|Yashia|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nYashia was a good-natured and empathetic [[Imperial soldier]] who occasionally held conversations with the [[Sith Acolyte]]s of the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Korriban academy]] coming across the [[Tomb of Naga Sadow]].<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n{{Quote|If you have no pity for the boy, think of the father then and the prestige you could gain from doing this. His father is a powerful man.|Yashia|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nYashia seemed to pity the fallen [[Naman Fal's son|acolyte]], therefore having cared a lot about his fate. The idea of his body rotting away in the tomb seemed to displease her quite a lot. Therefore, Yashia had reached out politely towards another acolyte and persuaded this one through claiming the acolyte would gain prestige as reward.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n{{Quote|I'd never survive in there, and even if I did, I wouldn't be allowed to see his father. He is a dark honor guard stationed in the Academy. None but Sith can ever set foot on the sacred ground where he stands watch.|Yashia|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nShe was very dutiful and well-versed in the rules of Korriban, such as not being allowed to step into the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|sacred grounds]]<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSentry Yashia serves as a quest-giver on [[Korriban]] for \"Grave Robbing\" in the game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''.
