He was slender, freckled, had short red hair, and resembled [[Kirtan Loor]].\n\n==Biography==\nSpart had been fascinated by tales of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] as a child and wished to be one. He applied to join the [[New Republic Defense Fleet/Legends|New Republic Defense Fleet]] during the [[Thrawn campaign]], but was deemed not skilled enough. He went to tech school and learned to be a [[Navigator/Legends|navigator]], but by the time he graduated the crisis was over and the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] demobilized. He then tried to become a civilian pilot for [[Tinta Lines]], but as of [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]] had had no success.\n\nHe later developed a hobby of trying to assemble all known facts on [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]], its membership, its equipment, and its kills. While doing this project, he unknowingly was seated next to [[Corran Horn]] on the shuttle ''[[Tinta Blue Seven]]'' when it was boarded by pirates working with the [[Invids]]. After Corran, masquerading as [[Jenos Idanian]], fought off and incapacitated the two would-be raiders, Spart navigated as Horn flew the shuttle away from [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Leonia Tavira]]'s Star Destroyer ''[[Invidious]]''.\n\nAfter their escape, the two took the shuttle to [[Elshandruu Pica]] to meet up with [[Booster Terrik]] aboard his Star Destroyer ''[[Errant Venture]]''. Keevy became ecstatic at being on the \"ship that won the [[Battle of Thyferra]]\", as he put it. Due to his skills at navigation, Booster hired Keevy on as the ''Venture''{{'s}} navigator.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spart, Keevy}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Navigators]]\n[[Category:Terrik organization personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
