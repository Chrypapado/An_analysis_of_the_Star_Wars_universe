A freelance [[Scout/Legends|scout]] by trade, Jobany was sympathetic to the Alliance's cause during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], and helped them scout many bases. However, his ancestry gave him a deep sense of nostalgia, and his scouting reports often read like travelogues.
