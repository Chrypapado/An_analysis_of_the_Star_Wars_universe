After her father became reclusive, Nell was forced to take over the day-to-day running of his business, a job that she disliked. At some point during [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] history, a group of agents traveled to Engebo V to purchase some [[Nerf steak/Legends|nerf steaks]] from Davengatt's ranch for the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Wylla]]. The agents met with Nell inside the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] [[Lurbi's Mercantile]] and she escorted them to her father's ranch. However, Engebo V became infested with [[skekfish]], which devoured Jaffro and forced Nell to flee the planet with the agents.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20011018a|text=Death, Dirt, and the Nerf Rancher's Daughter|int=Death, Dirt, and the Nerf Rancher's Daughter|archivedate=20100325035306}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davengatt, Nell}}\n[[Category:Engebo V residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
