As the sibling of [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Ziro]], [[Pazda Desilijic Tiure|Pazda]], and [[Zorba Desilijic Tiure]], Jiliac was a second-degree relative to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] whose sole [[Parent/Legends|parent]] was Zorba. [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] knew Jiliac first as a Hutt [[Lord/Legends|Lord]], then as Lady Jiliac after [[Gender/Legends|she]] had decided to [[Reproduction/Legends|conceive]] and birth her own Huttlet. Jiliac was later [[Death/Legends|killed]] by [[Durga Besadii Tai]] to avenge [[Aruk Besadii Aora|his father]] whom Jiliac had murdered, and Jabba smothered [[Jiliac Desilijic Tiron's child|Jiliac's child]] to prevent any threats to his own power.\n\n==Biography==\nJiliac Desilijic Tiron was a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] who was a member of the [[Desilijic/Legends|Desilijic]] [[Kajidic/Legends|kajidic]] and was the sibling of [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Ziro]], [[Pazda Desilijic Tiure|Pazda]], and [[Zorba Desilijic Tiure]]. Jiliac ran a criminal empire from a [[Winter Palace]] on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] and ruled [[Dilbana]] as its de facto [[Governor/Legends|governor]].\n\nJiliac was a second-degree relative to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] through Jiliac's brother and Jabba's sole [[Parent/Legends|parent]] Zorba. Jabba and [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] Jiliac collaborated to run a profitable venture supplying raw spice to the [[Besadii/Legends|Besadii]] refining operations of [[Zavval]] and [[Teroenza]] on [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]]. Besadii and Desilijic were engaged in a minor feud at the time which discouraged pilots to come and ship [[Spice/Legends|spice]] to and from Ylesia. Jiliac hired [[Drell (species)|Drell]] [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] to attack Besadii shipping, steal the refined spice and then sell it on for a profit. The scheme was uncovered by a young [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] who successfully engaged the pirates. Zavval then sent Han Solo and the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Jalus Nebl]] to the Winter Palace, armed with a gift of a [[Hookah pipe/Legends|hookah pipe]] and a thinly veiled threat warning Jiliac to stop [[Gender/Legends|his]] attacks; otherwise, Besadii would engage in full scale warfare. Jiliac was so incensed that he lost his temper and smashed up his throne room, telling Solo and Nebl that Zavval was a dead Hutt. He could go on pretending that he was alive, but Jiliac would have his revenge.\n\nThe death of Zavval at the hands of Han Solo, [[Muuurgh]], and [[Bria Tharen]] left Ylesia in the precarious control of Teroenza, who was chafing at the restrictions imposed upon him and his fellow Priests at the hands of [[Aruk Besadii Aora]]. Although Besadii profits had been wiped out in the year following the death of Zavval, the kajidic bounced back, increasing their fortunes exponentially and becoming more of a threat to Desilijic. In an ironic turn of events, Besadii hired some Drell pirates of their own and arranged for them to intercept Jabba's ship, which was being piloted by Han Solo who was now working for Jiliac and Jabba. Fortunately for Jabba, Han Solo had already outfought Drell pirates and successfully beat them off a second time. Jiliac decided that Besadii's assassination attempts were getting a little too close for comfort and that a moratorium had to be declared buying precious time. At the same time near [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], Jiliac decided that he wanted to have a [[Youngling/Legends|child]]. Jiliac conceived [[Reproduction/Legends|asexually]] to become pregnant and shifted gender to female.\n\nThe [[Hutt Ruling Council]] met where Besadii and Desilijic were quick to begin accusing each other, pointing out the crimes of each kajidic. Jiliac maneuvered Aruk into declaring a moratorium which was extremely well received by all the clans. Upon their return to Nal Hutta, Jiliac and Jabba decided that Aruk was too powerful and too clever to be allowed to be left alive and that he should be struck through his weak spot, Teroenza. It was during this discussion that an underling informed the two Hutts that [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Sarn Shild]], in response to another insurrection in Imperial Space, was going to blockade [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]] and bring the Hutts to their knees, figuratively speaking as the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] blamed them for weapons running to rebel groups. Jiliac sent Han Solo to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] in an attempt to bribe [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Winstel Greelanx]]. The Hutts purchased a new set of planetary shields to protect themselves and bought the services of the pirate [[Drea Renthal]].\n\nMeanwhile, Jiliac's plan to bring down Aruk was beginning to bear fruit. Teroenza finally decided to break with Besadii and secretly met with Jiliac and Jabba in deep space, where it was agreed that Jiliac would provide Teroenza with a concoction from the [[Malkite Poisoners]] which caused the erosion of higher brain functions in [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] beings, but did not affect more primitive beings such as the [[nala tree frog]]s that were used as the delivery system.\n\nThe Imperials arrived in Hutt Space and began to blockade [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. The [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] fleet, led by [[Mako Spince]], Solo, [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], and [[Salla Zend]] had a few tricks of their own. Jiliac had neglected to bring her personal [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]], the ''[[Dragon Pearl]]'', to the Winter Palace and it was commandeered by the smugglers for use in the battle. They engaged in the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|battle]] and won the day. In the midst of the post-battle chaos, Jiliac withdrew the poison and Aruk's brain went into convulsions shortly before he died. Her victory, however, was short-lived, as Besadii had a new leader and control of Ylesia remained in their grasp.\n\nAfter Jiliac gave birth to [[Jiliac Desilijic Tiron's child|her Huttlet]], her increasing preoccupation with her offspring concerned Jabba. She began spending more and more time with her Huttlet while delegating increasingly more tasks to Jabba. He began to get more and more resentful of his aunt because of this, and pointed out how difficult it was running the kajidic by himself. He secretly began to covet her position and consolidate his own power.\n\nIn order to help Jabba a little, Jiliac suggested that Besadii need to be punished by the Hutt Grand Council; the Besadii were not affected by the Battle of Nar Shaddaa and continued to sell slaves and spice to the Empire. She sent Jabba to represent her on the council and he gave a fine speech that won over most of the Hutts there. [[Durga Besadii Tai]], son of Aruk, had contacted [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] to arrange for the death of all his rivals. Since he was too busy investigating his parent's death, he sent [[Zier]] to represent him. A censure vote was taken and Jiliac unexpectedly turned up in the middle of the vote, embarrassing Jabba in front of his fellow Hutts.\n\nDurga's efforts to find his father's poisoner were continually frustrated in secret by Black Sun in an attempt for Prince [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]] to gain a foothold in Hutt Space. Durga went to the Prince for assistance, who revealed it was Jiliac who had purchased enough poison to bankrupt a medium-sized colony. Enraged, Durga challenged Jiliac under the [[Old Law]]. The two Hutts battled to the death. Durga had youth and speed on his side; Jiliac had size and power on hers. The two fought each other to a standstill when Jiliac saw her [[Hoversled/Legends|repulsorsled]] in the corner. She slithered towards it, intending to mount it and ram in into Durga, but Durga beat her there, pushed the controls with his tail switching off the [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsor]], pinning Jiliac to the floor. Durga than repeatedly slammed his tail on Jiliac's head until she died and continued pounding until Jiliac was an unrecognizable mess. After the battle, Jabba went into the room and was startled when the corpse began to tremble. It was Jiliac's offspring coming out of the brood pouch. Although Jabba would be named unquestioned leader of the kajidic, he did not want to leave any loose ends and smothered her Huttlet.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Hnn|48|regional/13321_5.html|Zorba the Hutt Sentenced to 45 Years|https://web.archive.org/web/20050220010350/http://www.holonetnews.com:80/48/regional/13321_5.html}}\n*{{Hnn|56|regional/13516_2.html|100 Metric Tons of Ryll Seized|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728112031/http://www.holonetnews.com/56/regional/13516_2.html}}\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*''[[Shadow Games]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031204hutt|text=Hutt!
