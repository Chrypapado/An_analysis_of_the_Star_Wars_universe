As much as I enjoy listening to your verbal tirade, I think you should both know that Jostero's crew have been talking amongst themselves.

During the war Conevor made a bet with a group known as the [[Silestro Privateers]] that Tala could beat their leader [[Jostero]] in a [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] race, putting up his [[Starship/Legends|starship]] as a bet. During the race between Tala and Joestro, which took place on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], Gus contacted Tala several times using a [[Comm unit/Legends|comm unit]], much to here annoyance, informing her and Conevor that the [[Privateer/Legends|privateers]] planned to kill them no matter the outcome. He claimed to have a plan they could follow to avoid this, and shortly afterwards Tala finished the race in first place, beating Joestro. As the privateers prepared to attack Tala along with Gus and Conevor, who had been waiting at the finish line, a [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] belonging to the [[Corellian Security Force]] arrived and both groups involved in the race fled.
