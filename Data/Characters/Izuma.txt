After the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] left Keelia, they also abandoned several [[B1-series battle droid]]s, which were salvaged by Izuma and [[Gender|his]] associates. They then reprogrammed the battle droids to do their bidding.<ref name=\"The Village Bride\" />\n\nAt one point, Izuma threatened [[Meevai Village]]; though the raiders wanted to take its [[chief]] as collateral, the chief's granddaughter, [[Haru]], offered to take his place. At the celebration for the [[marriage]] between Haru and [[Asu]], [[Valco]] revealed what was to come for Haru, attempting to lead [[F]] into stepping in and saving the village. Though F was aware of what Valco was trying to do and was hesitant, she eventually changed her mind, intervening when the raiders, led by Lord Izuma, arrived to take Haru. As F revealed herself as a [[Jedi]] to the raiders, Valco fired upon the battle [[droid]]s using a [[sniper rifle]]. Valco then threw his [[helmet]], containing explosives, to the ground below, destroying [[Izuma's starship]] and deactivating the remaining droids. F then defeated Izuma, saving Haru and the village.<ref name=\"The Village Bride\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{VisionsCite|The Village Bride}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Keelia residents]]"}}}]}}}}
