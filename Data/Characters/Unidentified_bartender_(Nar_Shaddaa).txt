The [[bounty hunter]] [[Deva Lompop]] visited the bar while attempting to track down the [[Hunting|hunter]] [[Boba Fett]], who was in possession of the [[carbonite]] matrix containing the frozen [[Han Solo]]. When asked about Fett, the bartender declined having seen [[Gender|him]]. Lompop later returned to the establishment in order to extract information from [[Doc Ragon]], who had stabilized the carbonite matrix for Fett. The [[bounty]] hunter made an agreement with the bartender, providing payment after a drunken Ragon told her about Solo.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Boba Fett?

When the [[bounty hunter]] [[Deva Lompop]] visited Nar Shaddaa in search of fellow [[Hunting|hunter]] [[Boba Fett]], who had been waylaid on [[Gender|his]] journey to bring the [[carbonite]]-frozen body of [[Han Solo]] to the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]], Lompop entered the bartender's establishment to ask about Fett. The bartender, while wiping down the surface of the bar, claimed not to have seen Fett, and the [[bounty]] hunter moved on.<ref name=\"WOTBH Jabba\" />\n\nLompop soon returned, however, to acquire information from the [[Besalisk]] [[Doc Ragon]], who Fett had previously visited to stabilize the carbonite matrix containing Solo. Having made a deal with the bartender, Lompop ensured that the Besalisk became drunk, revealing the details of Solo's status and location. After receiving sufficient information, Lompop incapacitated Ragon by pouring a substance into his drink. As per their agreement, the bounty hunter proceeded to pay the bartender, who questioned if Lompop was sure that Ragon was not [[Death|dead]]. Lompop assured the bartender that the Besalisk was alive, but that he would wish he were dead once he had awoken.<ref name=\"WOTBH Jabba\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThe bartender was willing to make an agreement with Lompop that involved her incapacitating Ragon, one of the establishment's clients, but inquired whether he was alive after being paid. Possessing short [[Color|black]] [[hair]] tied in a knot as well as facial hair of the same color, the bartender had yellow [[eye]]s as well as brown skin and fur.<ref name=\"WOTBH Jabba\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nThe bartender wore a green vest, light gray pants, and a brown [[belt]].
