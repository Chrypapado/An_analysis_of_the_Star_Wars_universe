The Medoric was a military bar and Moy'nast was able to learn about [[Thaereian military]] troop movements and personnel changes. He was secretly an informer for the [[Cularin Militia]] and he was given the code name '''RODIAN MIME'''. When the Thaereians withdrew all their forces on Cularin to Soboll, [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Xirossk]] of the Militia gave the [[Heroes of Cularin]] details about Moy'nast, so that they could find him and discover from him the location of the Thaereian commander, [[Kurth San]]. However, before they could find the Bothan, he was arrested by the Thaereians.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lockdown on Soboll]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Moy'nast, Betrek}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
