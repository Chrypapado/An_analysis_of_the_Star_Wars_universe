I believe you will bring balance to the Force. That you will face your demons and save the universe.|Qui-Gon Jinn and Anakin Skywalker|Ghosts of Mortis}}\n'''Anakin Skywalker''' was a legendary [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who was a [[Jedi Knight]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] and the prophesied [[Chosen One]] of the [[Jedi Order]], destined to bring balance to [[the Force]]. Also known as \"'''Ani'''\" during his childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker \"[[Hero With No Fear]]\" from his accomplishments in the [[Clone Wars]]. His alter ego, '''Darth Vader''', the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]], was created when Skywalker turned to the [[dark side of the Force]], pledging his allegiance to the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]] at the end of the [[Republic Era]].\n\nA [[vergence]] in the Force, Skywalker was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[desert]] [[planet]] of [[Tatooine]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]] in [[41 BBY]]. He was the son of [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]], a [[Slavery|slave]] who conceived a [[Youngling|child]] without a [[Parent|father]]. His [[blood]] contained over twenty-thousand [[midi-chlorian]]s, surpassing that of [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] and all other [[Jedi]] in [[the galaxy]]. [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], the [[Jedi Master]] who discovered Skywalker during the [[Invasion of Naboo]] in [[32 BBY]], theorized that Skywalker was conceived by the midi-chlorians. Following the [[Battle of Naboo]], the [[Jedi High Council]] admitted Skywalker into the Order as the [[Padawan]] of Jedi Knight [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] despite feeling that he was too old and emotional to adhere to the [[Jedi Code]]. During the early [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars, Skywalker served as a [[Jedi General]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], commanding the [[clone trooper]]s of the elite [[501st Legion]] against the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. He also oversaw the [[Jedi training]] of his own apprentice, [[Ahsoka Tano]], after receiving his knighthood. Although Jedi [[Religion|doctrine]] prohibited personal relationships, Skywalker had a secret [[Marriage|wife]], [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo]].\n\nIn [[19 BBY]], Skywalker learned that [[Supreme Chancellor]] Sheev Palpatine was [[Darth]] Sidious, the elusive Dark [[Lord]] of the [[Sith]] who orchestrated the war in order to take over the [[galaxy]]. While Skywalker was caring and compassionate, his fear of losing Amidala in childbirth caused him to turn against the Jedi Order, believing Sidious had the knowledge to [[Immortality|cheat]] [[death]]. Consumed by the persona of Darth Vader, the fallen Jedi Knight marched his [[legion]] on the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] of [[Coruscant]] where they executed its inhabitants, including [[Jedi Initiate|Jedi younglings]], as part of [[Order 66]] and the [[Great Jedi Purge]]. Vader was then sent to [[Mustafar]] to [[Mission to Mustafar|exterminate]] the [[Executive Separatist Council|Separatist Council]] at the behest of his [[Sith Master]], now the [[Proclamation of the New Order|self-proclaimed]] [[Galactic Emperor]]. Vader subsequently sustained severe injuries in his [[Duel on Mustafar|duel]] with Kenobi, and was [[Cybernetics|rebuilt]] as an [[Vader's armor|armored]] [[cyborg]] while his wife died of a broken [[heart]], though not before giving birth to the [[twin]]s [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] who were hidden from their father and the [[Emperor]] as the [[Galactic Empire]] rose to power.\n\nVader enforced the rule of the [[New Order]] as the Emperor's [[Sith apprentice]] throughout most of the [[Imperial Era]]. In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY]], he discovered the existence of his son and was determined to turn Luke to the dark side. Luke sought to become a Jedi, like his father before him, and believed that Vader had the potential to turn back to the [[light side of the Force]]. Vader was defeated by Luke during the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], but the young Jedi refused to strike down his father in anger, causing the Emperor to [[torture]] Luke with [[Force lightning]]. The pain inflicted on his son awakened the part of Vader that was still Anakin, resulting in a redeemed Skywalker killing Sidious at the cost of his own life. Having destroyed the Sith and fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One, Skywalker made peace with his son and became [[Force spirit|one with the Force]].\n\nAnakin Skywalker was one of the most powerful Jedi and Sith in [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]]. The Force was especially strong in the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker bloodline]], which culminated in Anakin's grandson, [[Ben Solo]], Organa's son who was born by the [[Galactic Concordance|end]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]] in [[5 ABY]]. Solo would turn to the dark side as well, becoming the [[Knights of Ren|dark warrior]] Kylo Ren during the [[New Republic Era|rise]] of the [[First Order]]. Like his grandfather, however, Solo found redemption by sacrificing his life for the love of another&mdash;the Jedi apprentice [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], who heard Skywalker's voice telling her to restore the balance, as he once had, during the [[Battle of Exegol]] in [[35 ABY]]. Solo's death ended the Skywalker bloodline, although Rey, the [[Palpatine family|granddaughter]] of Sidious, rejected her true heritage and took their surname to honor their legacy.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father?''\"<br />\"''There was no father.

Regardless,<ref name=\"backstories\">''[[Darth Vader: Sith Lord]]''</ref> Tatooine was Skywalker's homeworld.<ref name=\"swe-Anakin\" /> Skywalker and his [[Parent|mother]] were originally owned by [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder|Gardulla]] the [[Hutt]] until she lost them to the [[Toydarian]] [[Watto]] in a [[podracing]] bet when Skywalker was around age 3. Affectionately nicknamed \"Ani,\" he worked in [[Watto's junkshop|his master's shop]], located in [[Mos Espa]].<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nEven at a young age, Skywalker exhibited exceptional [[pilot]]ing skills, and built the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], specially modified to withstand Tatooine's sand and heat<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> for his mother.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Once, while he was working in Watto's scrapyard, he found a broken [[servomotor]] he thought he could repair and use on the droid he was building and asked his master for it. With a glance, Watto saw that it was worthless and grunted that he could, but as Skywalker walked away, Watto told him nothing was free and had him work harder the next day.<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" />\n\n[[File:Anakin_Skywalker_gets_Threepio_photoreceptors.png|thumb|right|200px|Skywalker used salvaged parts to rebuild protocol droid for household duties.]]\nSkywalker got the [[photoreceptor]]s for the droid at a [[Mos Espa Market|market]] in Mos Espa. Though a [[Gran]] wanted them too and chased him through the market, Skywalker escaped by destroying an [[Ithorian]]'s stall and blocking the Gran's pursuit.<ref name=\"Ashcan\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|Ashcan|}}</ref> Before he had even turned nine, Skywalker's work had ensured 3PO was operational.<ref name=\"Anakin Encyclopedia\">{{EncyclopediaCite|Anakin Skywalker (Star Wars Encyclopedia)|Anakin Skywalker}}</ref> He was close friends with fellow slaves [[Kitster Banai]] and [[Wald]], as well as the elderly [[Jira]].

When looking at it, Anakin found an ultra power cell, just what he needed for his pod. Suddenly, a swoop gang with a [[Devaronian]] member attacked the streets and shot the generator for the medical center. When Anakin examined it to see if he could repair the generator he saw that it needed a power cell. So, he took his power cell and saved the medical center. A week later, Anakin participated in a pod race with [[Sebulba]] who made him lose by cheating. Anakin stated that if he would have used the power cell on his own pod, he would have won but it was more important for the medical center to receive it.<ref name=\"SWA 6\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=6|story=[[Tales from Wild Space: Podracer's Rescue]]}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery===\n====Found by the Jedi====\n{{Quote|There's something about this boy.|Qui-Gon Jinn|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\n[[File:Anakin_Meets_Padme.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker introduced himself to Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who was surprised to learn that the boy was enslaved.]]\nOne day, at the age of 9, Watto shouted for him to come inside the junk shop, to find a tall man, a young woman, a [[Gungan]], and an [[astromech droid]], conversing with Watto.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Skywalker had first seen the young woman, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala|Padm\u00e9 Naberrie]], when he looked up from his work, mistaking her for an [[Diathim|angel]],<ref name=\"Peril\">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref> a species he had overheard spacers talk about, from the moons of [[Iego]]. Unknown to Skywalker, Naberrie was in fact Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the [[Monarch of Naboo]], who had switched places with one of her [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|Royal Handmaidens]], to visit Tatooine.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAt Watto's instructions, Skywalker manned the shop while Watto took the man, [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], into the junkyard. Skywalker was fascinated by the beauty of Padm\u00e9, so much that he asked her if she was an angel. Shortly after Watto and Jinn returned to the shop, Jinn informed his companions that they were leaving.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nFortunately for Skywalker, Watto allowed him to leave after he cleaned up the mess that [[Jar Jar Binks]] had made. As he headed home, Skywalker came across Binks, who was being attacked by Sebulba after the clumsy Gungan had disrupted the racer's meal. Breaking up the fight, Skywalker greeted Naberrie and the rest of her group when they arrived to see what was happening, and he convinced the group to follow him to Jira's fruit stand nearby. As he gave one of the pallies to Jinn, the boy was astonished to see a [[Qui-Gon Jinn's lightsaber|lightsaber]] on the man's waist when his poncho opened. When Jira warned the group that a sandstorm was coming, Skywalker insisted that the unprepared group come with him to his home.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nWhen they reached his house, he introduced the group to his mother and explained about the sandstorm before pulling Naberrie into his room to show her his project. Naberrie was genuinely impressed by Skywalker's work on C-3PO, prompting him to turn the droid on, and he also told her about the podracer he was constructing. The group stayed at the Skywalkers' as the sandstorm continued to rage, and during a meal, he began to explain life as a slave, though a brief argument between Naberrie and Shmi about slavery led Anakin to the subject of podracing. Mustering his courage, Skywalker asked Jinn about his lightsaber, and he refused to believe the Jedi's statement that he was not there to free the slaves. As the conversation turned to the group's damaged [[Naboo Royal Starship]], Skywalker volunteered to race in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] podrace so that Jinn could get the prize money. When his mother objected, Anakin reminded Shmi of her belief that people needed to help one another, convincing her to allow Anakin to race for Jinn.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nThe next morning, Jinn and the others accompanied Skywalker to Watto's shop, and the boy began to tell Watto about Jinn's proposal when Naberrie stopped Jinn outside for a brief conversation. When Watto asked how Jinn intended to sponsor the boy, Jinn proposed that that his ship would cover the entry fee. Watto initially suggested they split the winnings fifty-fifty, when Jinn proposed that Watto front the cash for the entry, and keep all of the winnings minus the cost of a new hyperdrive. Watto accepted the deal, and Skywalker was dismissed immediately with instructions to check out Jinn's podracer. As Skywalker worked, his friends Banai and Wald among them, arrived, but Wald and the others were skeptical of Skywalker's chances and left to go play elsewhere, except for Banai. Despite Skywalker's warnings, Binks became caught between the podracer's energy binders, causing his face to go numb. Anakin used a power pack that Jinn had lifted from Watto's shop to start the podracer, and the group was heartened to witness the engines activating and running perfectly.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nThat afternoon, Skywalker sustained a cut on his arm, though he did not notice it until later that night when Jinn tended to it and took a sample of his blood. Before Skywalker could get Jinn to tell him what he was doing with his blood, his mother called him inside their house for bedtime. He then sent this blood sample to Kenobi, who found that the young boy had even more midi-chlorians than esteemed Jedi Grandmaster Yoda.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n=====Racing to freedom=====\n{{Quote|Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.\"<br>\"I will.\"<br>\"May the Force be with you.|Qui-Gon Jinn advises Anakin before the beginning of the podrace.|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\nWith two eopies, Naberrie, Banai, Shmi, Anakin, R2-D2, and C-3PO hauled the podracer to the arena hangars, where Jinn had gone to meet with Watto. The Toydarian angrily left the hangar just as they arrived, confusing Skywalker with a comment about Jinn and betting, but Banai unintentionally revealed to Naberrie and the others that Skywalker had never actually finished a race, causing Naberrie to lose hope in the boy's chances.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nA little while later, the racers and their pods entered the arena and lined up for the race, and Shmi stopped her son to ask him to be safe before he headed out to his racer. Not even Sebulba's threats rattled Skywalker as Jinn helped him into the podracer [[cockpit]]. But to Skywalker's dismay, when the starting light turned green, the pod's engines stalled immediately thanks to Sebulba's sabotage, leaving him stuck at the starting line with only [[Ben Quadinaros]] and his stalled racer as the rest of the competitors flew off. Realizing that he had left out one step to start the pod, he rapidly flipped switches and adjusted settings to reset the engines and succeeded in starting the engines, flying out of the arena and chasing after the others.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Defensive_Racing_WotF.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker entered the Boonta Eve Classic to help his new friends, unaware that he was also competing for his freedom.]]\nHe soon caught up to the other racers, passing two before they even noticed him, and he prepared to pass the [[Troiken]] [[Gasgano]] as they approached Arch Canyon. Gasgano blocked his first few attempts, but Skywalker overtook him as they dropped over a short mesa and proceeded to slip into [[Arch Canyon]] quickly and without any trouble. [[Teemto Pagalies]] tried to push him into the rock, but Skywalker was able to pass him with a twist. Sebulba tossed a piece of debris behind him and into [[Mars Guo]]'s left engine intake, clogging the motors inside. The engine intake stopped working before the entire engine combusted. With Guo crashing into the desert sands, Skywalker was free to move ahead, going neck and neck with Sebulba as they passed the grid line into the third lap.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nGoing into the third lap, Sebulba still held the lead, as narrow as it was. With Skywalker close behind, and now out of surprise tricks, Sebulba resorted to sheer brutality in order to either keep Skywalker behind him or batter the boy enough to destroy his pod. Approaching the [[Laguna Caves]], a part of the course where [[Ratts Tyerell|Tyerell]] had crashed earlier, Sebulba rammed Skywalker off course, forcing him onto a steep service ramp. Boosting, Skywalker sped up the ramp at an exhilarating speed, propelling himself into the sky. The boy was quick to act and adjusted his pod accordingly, leveling his podracer's nosedive as he headed back for the ground. Not only did he save himself from an explosive wreck, but his jump off of the ramp put him directly in front of a surprised Sebulba. Skywalker continued to hold the lead until they ran into a series of archways. Suddenly Skywalker's left engine bucked and began to give off a stream of dense smoke. Sebulba's earlier sabotage was beginning to take effect as Skywalker pushed his pod to its limit. Skywalker managed to resolve his engine difficulties and quickly regained his ground, passing up several other podracers before gaining a tail on Gasgano. Although Skywalker had had issues with passing the [[Xexto]] earlier in the race, this time he swerved past Gasgano with little effort and eventually flew parallel with Sebulba as they headed for the final stretch of the course.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAs they approached the arena, Sebulba blocked every attempt of Skywalker's to pass, and he finally swerved his larger racer into Skywalker's in anger at the boy's repeated attempts\u2014only for the two racers' steering rods to be caught together. When Skywalker's rod finally snapped completely, his podracer began to shudder violently but broke free of Sebulba's racer, the engines of which shot forward and went flying out of control, slamming into rock and sand and exploding. As Sebulba's pod skidded to a halt, Skywalker shot toward the arena and across the finish line, winning the Boonta Eve Classic.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAs Skywalker came to a halt, the crowd swarmed his racer. Jinn hoisted Skywalker onto his shoulders in celebration. In the hangar, Skywalker met up with his family and friends. As Jinn approached, Anakin became embarrassed at Naberrie and his mother's constant hugs and kisses, but Jinn soon departed with Binks and Naberrie to take their parts back to the ship.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n=====Farewell to home=====\n{{Quote|Be brave. And don't look back.|Shmi Skywalker's parting words to her son|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\n[[File:Anakinandmom.jpg|thumb|left|266px|Shmi Skywalker and her emancipated son said goodbye to each other, the latter leaving Tatooine to join the Jedi Order.]]\nReturning home with Jinn, Skywalker ecstatically showed his mother the credits, and his happiness only increased when Jinn told him that he had been freed and Jinn wanted him to become a Jedi. Anakin was so excited that it was several minutes before he realized that Shmi had not been freed as well, and he was dismayed when Shmi insisted that Anakin go with Jinn to a better future without her. Packing his stuff, Skywalker bid goodbye to C-3PO, but when it came time to leave, Anakin's resolve broke and he ran back to his mother. He promised that he would return and free her. Despite their sorrow at parting, Shmi convinced her son to go with the Jedi.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAs they raced towards the starship that Naberrie and Jinn had come to Tatooine on, Skywalker was suddenly ordered to drop to the ground and complied just as a dark-[[robe]]d figure, [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] [[Maul]],<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> shot overhead on a speeder. The man leaped at Jinn, drawing a red-bladed lightsaber and attacking the Jedi as Jinn urged Skywalker to get aboard the ship and to take off. He rushed aboard, and Naberrie took him to the cockpit to tell Jinn's apprentice, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], what had happened. The pilot [[Ric Oli\u00e9]] followed Kenobi's instructions to fly towards the fight, and Skywalker scrambled into a seat as Kenobi raced to the landing ramp and helped Jinn escape from the dark warrior. Skywalker and Kenobi rushed to help Jinn as the ship took off and left Tatooine. When they were convinced Qui-Gon was fine, the Jedi master introduced Obi-Wan to Anakin, who was happy to meet another Jedi.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n=====Before the Jedi Council=====\n{{Quote|He ''is'' the Chosen One. You ''must'' see it!|Qui-Gon Jinn pleads to the Council to train Anakin.|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\n[[File:Young_Anakin_before_the_Council.jpg|thumb|right|299px|Qui-Gon Jinn believed Skywalker was the Chosen One, though the Jedi High Council deemed him too old and emotionally compromised.]]\nLater that night, aboard the ship, which Skywalker learned was the personal starship of the Queen of the planet Naboo, Skywalker struggled to fall asleep in the central chamber, as the ship's temperature was radically different to the constant heat of Tatooine that he was used to. As he huddled in silence, Skywalker witnessed Naberrie enter the room and watch a recording of a plea for help from the [[Naboo]] official [[Sio Bibble]]. She then noticed him and gave him her blanket, and the two discussed the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo and Naberrie's hopes that the Republic's Galactic Senate could resolve the crisis. Skywalker gave her a japor ivory wood pendant that he had carved for her so that she would remember him, and Naberrie comforted him as he became sad as he remembered his mother.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nWhen they finally arrived at the Republic capital of Coruscant, Skywalker watched from the cockpit in awe as they approached the city-planet, and the ship was greeted when it landed by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, Senator Palpatine of Naboo, and a contingent of Senate Guards. The Queen and her handmaidens&mdash;including Naberrie&mdash;departed with Palpatine, though they brought Skywalker and Binks along with them to Palpatine's office and left them outside while they discussed the situation.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nBefore he went to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]], Skywalker went to the Queen's chambers in search of Naberrie, but the Queen promised to pass on his message when the handmaiden was absent. Unbeknownst to Skywalker, however, the Queen was in fact Padm\u00e9.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nHarboring strong premonitions he had received on Tatooine, Qui-Gon Jinn believed Anakin Skywalker to be the [[Chosen One]] of prophecy who, it was foretold, would bring \"balance to [[the Force]]\"; Jinn revealed his belief and Anakin's corroborative midi-chlorian test results to members of the [[Jedi High Council]] before bringing the boy before them for their consideration of the boy's aptitude for life as a Jedi. At the Jedi Temple, Skywalker faced the twelve Jedi Masters on the Council. Mace Windu tested Skywalker's abilities by asking him to determine what images were appearing on a [[Jedi testing screen|testing screen]] that the Jedi was holding but that the boy could not see. Skywalker named them all with perfect accuracy. However, when Windu and Master Yoda questioned him about his feelings and his mother, Skywalker asked how that was relevant. Yoda explained that fear was the starting point on the path to the dark side. The ancient Jedi Master said he sensed a lot of fear in Skywalker.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAs night fell, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Jinn were called before the Council. The Jedi Masters acknowledged Skywalker's great power but refused to train him on account of his age&mdash;causing Jinn to declare that he would take the boy on as his own apprentice. The Council would initially refuse this, as Jinn already had his own apprentice, who was Kenobi but Jinn stated that he believed that Kenobi was already ready to become a Jedi Knight. However, Windu declared that the matter would be dealt with later, as the Naboo problem was more pressing. The Council permitted Skywalker to accompany Jinn, and the three returned to the Queen's starship, where Skywalker questioned Jinn about midi-chlorians. The Queen and her retinue departed not long afterward, leaving Coruscant and heading back to the occupied Naboo in hopes of freeing the world from the Trade Federation.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n=====First Battle of Naboo=====\n{{Quote|Now ''this'' is podracing!|Anakin, escaping the droid control ship|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\nAs they came out of [[hyperspace]] and approached the [[Naboo system]], Skywalker sat in the cockpit with Oli\u00e9 and learned about the ship's controls while Queen Amidala held a meeting with the Jedi and her staff and announced her intentions to ally with the Gungans in order to drive the Trade Federation off Naboo. The group landed in the swamps of Naboo and sent Binks to the Gungan capital city of [[Otoh Gunga]]. When Binks finally returned, he explained that Otoh Gunga was empty, but he took the group to the [[Gungan Sacred Place]], where the Gungans had no doubt fled after the Trade Federation invaded.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Anakin_Naboo_Battle.png|thumb|left|281px|Skywalker participated in the Battle of Naboo, piloting the starfighter that destroyed the Trade Federation's droid control ship.]]\nWhen the group was brought before [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass]], the leader of the Gungans, Skywalker was astonished to learn that Naberrie was, in fact, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the Queen of Naboo and that she had been posing as her double's handmaiden as a safety precaution. Skywalker, the Jedi, and Amidala's handmaidens joined the Queen in dropping to their knees before Boss Nass in a plea for Gungan aid, and Nass agreed to lend his army to the Queen's cause. In the hours that followed the meeting, Amidala and the Jedi began strategizing with the Gungan generals, leaving Skywalker to wander over to the Gungan sentries who were keeping watch for the returning [[Captain]] Panaka.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAs everyone prepared for the coming battle, Skywalker spotted and approached the handmaiden who had been acting as the Queen. Asking for her name, Skywalker told the girl, [[Sab\u00e9]], that he was happy to meet her and thanked her for keeping Naberrie safe. He was then called away by Jinn, but Sab\u00e9 was left touched nevertheless.<ref name=\"Peril\" />\n\nAnakin was a member of the group which, led by Amidala, grabbed the chance to recapture the [[Theed Royal Palace]]. When the group entered the Theed hangar bay, Skywalker heeded Jinn's command for him to stay hidden in the cockpit of one of the hangar's [[N-1 starfighter]]s. When several [[droideka]]s cornered the Naboo personnel in a firefight, Skywalker attempted to aid them with the N1's blaster cannons, although he accidentally activated the ship to go into space in the process. Skywalker fought in the [[Battle of Naboo]] in a vicious [[starfighter]] battle above the planet,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> coming to realize how much he loved flying over the course of the battle.<ref name=\"Peril\" />  After accidentally joining the battle in orbit, Skywalker single-handedly destroyed the orbiting [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|Droid Control Ship]] from within the ship, thus rendering the Trade Federation's ground forces inactive and saving the [[Gungan Grand Army]] from destruction.

Kenobi sometimes awoke at night and saw this.<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" /> During one of their many adventures, he also rescued Kenobi after he fell into a nest of [[gundark]]s.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nDuring his time as Kenobi's apprentice, Skywalker was distrustful of teachers who corrected him, wondering if they were trying to help him or simply put him in his place, knowing that many hadn't wanted him trained in the first place.<ref name=\"backstories\" /> Even so, there were many Jedi who had faith in him, seeing his potential.<ref name=\"Jedi vs Sith\">[[Star Wars: Jedi vs. Sith (book)|''Star Wars: Jedi vs. Sith'']]</ref>\n\nIn addition to struggling to control his emotions,<ref name=\"Jedi vs Sith\" /> he found it hard to make friends, as his fellow [[Padawan]]s were all aware of the rumors of him being the Chosen One.

However, when Master [[Tosan]] informed his master that he had a mission from the Council, Anakin's concentration broke due to the surprise of him leaving again. The [[Mission to Dallenor|mission]] was to go to the planet [[Dallenor]] so that he could collect an ancient [[Jedi holocron]] from a [[Dallenor Excavation|dig site]]. Obi-Wan told Anakin that he would be back shortly and that he would be training with Yoda in the meantime. Skywalker, displeased, complained that he would have to be in the class with \"little kids\" and that he was far ahead of them in his training. However, he complied and spent his time with the [[youngling]]s, although he didn't enjoy himself. However, after some encouragement from Yoda, Kenobi took Skywalker along with him on the mission in a [[T-6 shuttle]].<ref name=\"Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1\">[[Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1|''Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi'' 1]]</ref>\n\nSkywalker was glad that he was finally in space again and asked if he could pilot the shuttle. Kenobi told him that he could when they got closer to Dallenor. Skywalker asked what Obi-Wan's life was like before joining the Jedi Order. Kenobi told him that he didn't remember as he was taken in at a very young age. Anakin, sadly, expressed that he was always a Jedi and nothing else. Kenobi tried to reassure him by telling him that he still needed to train and was a Padawan when they both met. However, Skywalker was unconvinced and stated that his life was already set out for him and that he wasn't anything else, unlike him who was a slave. He concluded that this must be why the Jedi Council said he was too old to be trained. Obi-Wan tried to reassure him again by saying that the Council wasn't perfect and that Qui-Gon Jinn chose him just like he chose Kenobi. Skywalker, angered, proclaimed that Kenobi's master was dead and that now he was stuck with him. Before Kenobi could reassure Anakin, he walked away.<ref name=\"Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1\" />\n\n[[File:Mission_to_Dallenor.jpg|thumb|right|261px|Skywalker and Kenobi both felt that they had been forced to become Master and apprentice as a result of Jinn's death.]]\nUpon arriving on Dallenor, Kenobi and Skywalker encountered a female [[Togruta]] [[archaeologist]] named [[Clatriffe]]. She was glad that they arrived so they could take the [[holocron]] away due to the fact that it was causing problems. She explained that the local pirates wanted to get it and she had to hire local guards to keep them at bay. Kenobi ordered Skywalker to stay outside to keep watch whilst he and Clatriffe went inside the facility to obtain the holocron. After they went inside, Skywalker noticed that the pirates had arrived.<ref name=\"Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1\" />\n\nKenobi, Skywalker, and Clatriffe went out to meet them and were introduced to the [[Krypder Riders]] and their leader [[Hudso Shaku]], who knew that the holocron was something important due to offworlders wanting to get it. Kenobi stated that they had come in peace but were willing to defend themselves. He activated his lightsaber, whereupon Shaku ordered his pirates to attack him because he found the laser sword to be more valuable than the things that they dug up. Kenobi quickly disarmed the pirates but, while Skywalker froze up due to the suddenness of the attack, Shaku captured him by placing his sword under his chin. He ordered a trade, the boy for the lightsaber, but was taken down by Skywalker using the Force to assault Shaku with small pebbles. With Shaku knocked unconscious and the pirates' weapons destroyed, they surrendered to the Jedi.<ref name=\"Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1\" />\n\nOn the shuttle home, Kenobi praised Skywalker for his great work on his first mission. Skywalker, however, exclaimed that he froze up and wasn't ready for a mission even though he believed otherwise. Kenobi reassured Skywalker that it was he who was not ready. He asked that since he couldn't save his master from dying, how could he save his Padawan. Skywalker, with renewed confidence, stated that they would save each other and that that was what Qui-Gon would have wanted. Kenobi agreed and then recalled that Anakin wanted to fly the shuttle. Skywalker, in response, said yes enthusiastically.<ref name=\"Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi 1\" />\n\n====A chancellor for a friend====\n{{Quote|I have an errand to run, of sorts, and I thought Anakin might accompany me.|Sheev Palpatine to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan and Anakin 3}}\n[[File:Darth_Sidious_and_his_future_apprentice.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker considered Chancellor Palpatine a friend and a mentor.]]\nBy the time he was 12 in [[29 BBY]], he had built [[Anakin Skywalker's first lightsaber|his first lightsaber]];<ref name=\"OW&A 1\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 1|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 1]]</ref> after its construction, Kenobi said to him, \"Anakin, this weapon is your life.\"<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref><ref name=\"The Big Bang\">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref> Three [[Standard year|years]] after the Battle of Naboo, Skywalker sought to impress his peers at the Jedi Temple.

Though Skywalker answered that he was and that \"training to become a Jedi [was] all [he] ever wanted,\" it did plant a seed of doubt in his mind.<ref name=\"OW&A 4\" />\n\nLater, at the Jedi Temple, Skywalker confided in Kenobi that he wished to leave the Order, feeling uncomfortable at the prospect of his entire life being decided when he was only nine years old, and surrendered his [[lightsaber]] to his master. Though Kenobi took the weapon, he pleaded for Skywalker to reconsider.<ref name=\"OW&A 4\" />\n\n====Mission to Carnelion IV====\n{{Quote|The road lies before you, Anakin Skywalker.

They began their journey to the coordinates, but their shuttle was damaged due to the planet's [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] debris field, and the two had to eject from the doomed vessel, landing below the [[Celadon Sea]]. Not too long afterward, they came to be aware of life on the planet as a sky battle raged over them, and Kenobi returned his lightsaber to him so that he could defend himself. As one of the combatant airships began to fall, Skywalker and Kenobi saved its two-person crew by delaying the crash.<ref name=\"OW&A 1\" />\n\n[[File:Open_Closed_War.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Though tempted by the prospects of life outside of the Jedi Order, Skywalker chose to continue his training under Kenobi.]]\nThe two survivors, [[Kolara]] and [[Mother (title)|Mother]] [[Pran]], who identified themselves as \"[[Open]],\" knew nothing about what a Jedi was.<ref name=\"OW&A 1\" /> They were forced to take cover when a \"[[Closed]]\" airship, which Kenobi fell; Skywalker saved its pilot, [[Grecker]], from falling to his death. But due to the historical feud between their factions, Grecker and Pran tried to murder each other, forcing Skywalker and Kenobi to destroy their weapons and to escort them to safety. To facilitate their journey, they used the intact parts of each of their airships to form a new one in order to fly to their destination. During the conversations that ensued, Skywalker mentioned his and Kenobi's purpose on the planet: to find the person who had sent the Jedi distress signal,<ref name=\"OW&A 2\" /> which alerted Pran and Grecker to the location of \"[[Sera|the scavenger]].\"<ref name=\"OW&A 3\" />\n\nDuring the journey, Kolara told Skywalker about the mysterious kites, before noticing that he was good at fixing things, as he made an adjustment to his lightsaber. Kolara and Pran then had Skywalker repair a bag of [[droid brain]]s and, seeing his usefulness, threw away his lightsaber and abducted him when a horde of [[Fisher (Carnelion IV)|fishers]] attacked the ship, leaving Kenobi alone with Grecker as the airship crashed<ref name=\"OW&A 3\" /> below the Celadon Sea. Skywalker was taken to one of the Open's fortresses, where he witnessed as Pran used the processors he had repaired to activate some battle droids. As they left to wage war on the mysterious [[scavenger]] (who reminded both Open and Closed of everything they had lost and how badly they had failed),<ref name=\"OW&A 4\" /> Skywalker remained with the younger Open, whom he convinced to protect the scavenger and help him get back to Kenobi.<ref name=\"OW&A 5\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 5|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 5]]</ref>\n\nUsing their help, Skywalker fixed the remaining droids and intervened in the skirmish between the Open and Closed unfolding right next to [[Sera's fortress museum|Sera's fortress]]. He saved his master from Mother Pran and met with Kolara and Sera, but rather than try to stop the fight, Kenobi had Skywalker repair a communications unit and called the Republic for aid. Soon enough, a task force arrived and forced the natives to cease hostilities. In the aftermath, his master offered Skywalker his lightsaber, asking if he was still adamant about leaving the Order, but Skywalker decided to remain a member.<ref name=\"OW&A 5\" />\n\n====Rescuing Master Yoda====\nAt some point after the mission to Carnelion IV,<ref name=\"Date note\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 2|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 2]] states that [[Anakin Skywalker]] is twelve [[Standard year|years]] old during the [[mission to Carnelion IV]].

Therefore, Skywalker was born in [[41 BBY]], and the mission to [[Carnelion IV]] occurred in [[29 BBY]].

Upon their return to Coruscant, an [[assassin]]ation [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|attempt]] on Padm\u00e9 Amidala, now Senator of Naboo, prompted the Jedi Council\u2014at the behest of Chancellor Palpatine\u2014to send Skywalker and Kenobi to protect Amidala from future attacks. Anakin was delighted to see her after so many years; he had thought about her every day since they parted. When Padm\u00e9 said she wanted to know who wanted her dead, and Obi-Wan started to explain that they were only there to protect her life, not to investigate, Anakin promised Padm\u00e9 to find who was responsible, annoying Obi-Wan. When Padm\u00e9 retreated to her chambers, Anakin was disappointed, claiming that Padm\u00e9 hardly even recognized him; however, Jar Jar, who was a representative in the Senate during this time, said, Padm\u00e9 was very happy to see him.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nDuring that night, Anakin and Padm\u00e9 agreed on a plan of using her as bait, in order to capture the assassin, much to Obi-Wan's dismay. Anakin told him that although Padm\u00e9 had covered the cameras in her bedchamber, he was certain he would sense if anything were to happen in the room. Kenobi had doubts about his Padawan's power. Shortly after, when his master noticed that Skywalker was tired, he admitted that he had constant nightmares about his mother; he also revealed his powerful affection for Amidala. Obi-Wan warned him to control his emotions, saying that Padm\u00e9 was a politician after all, and could not be trusted. This led the two into a debate about whether every politician, including Amidala and Palpatine, was corrupt. As Skywalker expressed his faith in Palpatine's benevolence, he sensed something in Padm\u00e9's room. He arrived just in time to cut two venomous [[kouhun]]s in half, just a few centimeters from the senator's face. Obi-Wan noticed the assassin's droid at the window and threw himself out, grabbing it.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Koro-2.jpg|thumb|left|231px|Skywalker and Kenobi chasing Zam Wesell]]\nAnakin rushed to a row of speeders parked near Padm\u00e9's apartment. When the bounty hunter [[Zam Wesell]] shot her droid down, Skywalker arrived upon the scene as his Master was in free fall. Catching Kenobi, the Padawan continued the pursuit of Wesell's [[Koro-2 all-environment Exodrive airspeeder|airspeeder]]. Spotting the Jedi, Wesell took her speeder on a nosedive\u2014plunging several meters toward the lower levels of Coruscant. With the Jedi relentlessly pursuing her, Wesell flew through the exhaust flames of the [[Kerdos Company recycling plant]], hoping that the flames would scorch her adversaries in the open-top speeder. Seeing the pair still chasing her and unharmed by the flames, Wesell fired at the couplings of a nearby electrical plant, causing the Jedi's speeder to be inundated by electrical shock.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nSkywalker, an expert pilot himself, quickly caught up to Wesell. The bounty hunter steered her craft into a network of skytunnels, aiming once again to lose the pursuing Jedi. Skywalker did not chase directly into the tunnel but opted to travel an alternate route. Wesell wove through the local network of tunnels. Anakin and Obi-Wan thought they lost her, but just a few minutes later Anakin noticed the bounty hunter's airspeeder below, and jumped out, let his body drop the intervening distance through the air, then latched a firm hand-grip to its rear canopy handle. He ultimately was forced to let go when she shot at him, although not before getting a good look at her, wherein he deduced that Zam was not only a female but also a changeling (he'd briefly glimpsed Wesell's true form when she looked up). The Jedi ignited his lightsaber and sliced at the windscreen, knocking out the guidance systems. Wesell shot the lightsaber out of Skywalker's hand, but the ensuing struggle caused Wesell to misfire her blaster pistol, damaging the control pipes. Meanwhile, Kenobi, who was behind Wesell at this point, caught Skywalker's lightsaber. The airspeeder began to plummet toward the surface, crashing near the [[Outlander Club]]. Wesell crawled from the crash site and fled into the club.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nAnakin was about to follow Zam into the building when Obi-Wan stopped him, returning to him his lightsaber, reiterating, \"this weapon is your life.\" As they headed to the Outlander, Kenobi said he had the feeling his apprentice would be the death of him. Anakin indignantly responded that Obi-Wan was like a father to him. Inside the Outlander Club, Anakin was instructed by his master to search the premises while he went for a drink at the bar. Wesell hid until the two Jedi separated, then slowly approached the seemingly vulnerable Jedi at the bar. To secure the accuracy of her shot, she continued approaching the Jedi with her weapon drawn while Kenobi, through the Force, sensed the bounty hunter's intentions. In an instant, Kenobi ignited his lightsaber, spun around, and severed Wesell's arm below the elbow.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi took the wounded bounty hunter and dragged her from the club, setting her in an alley behind the club for interrogation. Wesell was initially reluctant to give any information about who had hired her, replying that it had simply been a job. As Skywalker pressed her, however, Wesell prepared to divulge the information. Suddenly, [[Jango Fett|a mysterious figure]] fired a toxic dart into Zam's neck.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n====Return to Tatooine====\n{{Quote|Ani? Is it you?

Skywalker was also troubled by [[Force vision|dreams]] of his mother suffering, which prompted him to return to Tatooine and [[Mission to rescue Shmi Skywalker Lars|rescue]] her, to which Amidala agreed to accompany him. On Tatooine, the two located Watto, who revealed that he had sold Shmi to a [[moisture farmer]] named [[Cliegg Lars]].

Using the information supplied by Kenobi, Skywalker surmised that Trench would lock onto the ship's magnetic signature to destroy it and so, Skywalker de-cloaked once more, firing another volley of missiles at Trench's dreadnought. Trench took the bait and locked onto the stealth ship's magnetic signature, firing several [[tracking torpedo]]es. Skywalker then steered the ship straight at the ''Invincible'', scraping right past its hull before Trench's own missiles slammed into the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]].

On the suspiciously empty [[Christophsis Separatist headquarters|Separatist headquarters]], Skywalker and Kenobi ran into Asajj Ventress, whom they dueled before flying two [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform|STAPs]] back to his base.

The impending Separatist threat made it impossible for them to leave their post, so Skywalker and Tano (whom Skywalker nicknamed \"Snips\") went behind enemy lines to destroy their droids' [[deflector shield]] generator while Kenobi stalled for time by holding a fake surrender negotiation with General [[Whorm Loathsom|Loathsom]]. Despite having to fight a few droids that protected the generator, the two managed to destroy it, allowing the Republic army to finish off the droids and win the battle.

He gave her some time to recover but informed her that they needed to proceed with the attack on the blockade, which upset Tano because he was rushing the plan despite their recent losses. Though he told her to go cool off somewhere, Skywalker had an idea\u2014he evacuated the damaged ''[[Defender]]'', which he would pilot by himself into the [[Ryloth system]] to distract the Separatists, while he gave Tano full command of the attack operation. By the time Turk realized the ruse, it was too late, for Skywalker had already escaped in an [[escape pod]] and let the ''Defender'' collide with Tuuk's control ship; though Tuuk escaped, Tano destroyed the Confederate fleet, and Skywalker was rescued from his escape pod.<ref name=\"Ryloth 1\" />\n\nAfter Kenobi and his men were able to take out the proton cannons and allow the [[transport]]s to land,<ref name=\"Ryloth 2\">{{TCW|Innocents of Ryloth}}</ref> whereas Windu headed for [[Lessu]] with his forces, Skywalker and his forces secured the space around [[Ryloth]], forcing the remaining Separatist cruisers to flee.

However, Separatist General [[Wat Tambor]] soon deployed [[Hyena-class Droid Fighter/Bomber|''Hyena''-class Droid Bombers]] to destroy Ryloth's villages and Skywalker engaged them in his [[interceptor]], accompanied by Tano and clones. Before Lessu was destroyed on Count Dooku's orders, Skywalker and Tano shot them down.

While Skywalker and Tano argued about the retreat, as Tano believed the droids were retreating, she boarded the gunship in time, and the three Jedi watched as her abandoned vehicles were destroyed. Back at the Jedi Temple, Skywalker attempted to take the blame for her disobedience, citing that he had given her more freedom due to her skills. Still, the Council relegated her to guard duty in the [[Jedi Archives]] to reflect on what she had done.<ref name=\"Holocron Heist\" />\n\nWhen Yoda sensed that thieves would [[Raid on the Jedi Temple|arrive]] at the Temple, Skywalker, and Kenobi inaccurately deduced that their enemies were after their transmission codes and went to secure them, only to be proven wrong when they located the intruders' position at the ventilation shaft. They were misdirected then to the communication center, where they narrowly escaped an exploding [[Todo 360|Todo]], and realized only too late that [[Cad Bane]] had stolen a holocron from the [[Holocron Vault|Vault]].

After an explosion rocked the ship, the Jedi spotted Bane and chased him into a trap. After a duel with Tano, the [[bounty hunter]] took her as a hostage, and Skywalker was forced to bow to Bane's demands and open the holocron. Though he did so, Skywalker also pulled his and Tano's lightsabers to himself and attacked Bane. However, Bane distracted him by opening the [[airlock]] on Tano's cell and escaped, while Skywalker saved his Padawan and made their way to the hangar, where troopers had stolen a shuttle the escape the exploding Separatist ship back to the ''Resolute'', not before letting Bane enter, disguised in [[Phase I clone trooper armor|trooper armor]].<ref name=\"Cargo of Doom\" /> After landing on the ''Resolute'', Rex later noticed [[Duros]] blood in the shuttle, and pursued Bane, who nevertheless managed to escape in a [[V-19 Torrent starfighter|V-19 starfighter]].

Sensing the future, Skywalker and Tano were [[Mission to Naboo|assigned]] to Naboo to set a trap for Bane in [[Jan-gwa city]], capturing him as he attempted to kidnap [[Roo-Roo Page]]. With the real child safe, the two Jedi took Bane to the ''Resolute'', where Skywalker, Windu, and Kenobi interrogated the bounty hunter with a combined [[mind trick]]; exhausted, Bane gave them [[Black Stall Station|coordinates]] that Kenobi and Windu were to [[Mission to Black Stall Station|follow]], while Skywalker reported the details to Palpatine on Coruscant. Soon, however, he reunited with his Padawan and R2-D2 and began to examine Bane's Starfighter, from which Skywalker and Tano deduced from the ashes on it and its refueling record that Bane had been to [[Mustafar]]. With nothing else to do, the Jedi pair [[Mission to Mustafar (Skywalker and Tano)|left]] on the ''Twilight'' for the planet, where they found the children. Though one of the droids set the building to be destroyed in the [[Magma|lava]] on Sidious's orders, Skywalker and Tano saved the children and returned to Coruscant.

Trapped on the planet, they came across a [[nysillin]] [[farm]] village after searching around for a while. They soon realized that the [[Felucian]] villagers were being protected by a [[Sugi's bounty hunters|group of bounty hunters]] led by [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]]\u2014[[Embo]], [[Rumi Paramita]], and [[Seripas]]. The village elder,<ref name=\"Bounty Hunters\">{{TCW|Bounty Hunters (episode)|Bounty Hunters}}</ref> [[Casiss Midagatis]],<ref name=\"Join the Battle\" /> explained to the Jedi trio that they had hired the bounty hunters because pirates had been taking their crops.

Ohnaka then told the group that he would be back, but by then Skywalker had taught the Felucians how to fight with staffs\u2014though slow at first, they eventually picked up the craft. After a few days, the Ohnaka Gang returned as promised, and a [[Skirmish on Felucia|skirmish]] ensued between the factions. During the confrontation, Skywalker dueled Ohnaka and his [[electrostaff]], leaving him hanging off a cliff and begging for mercy, to which the Jedi Knight pulled him up and Ohnaka realized that their efforts were no longer profitable, leaving on [[Corona-class armed frigate|his ship]].

Though exceedingly effective, the bomb created a crater, which Windu went to investigate whereas Skywalker was to ensure the treaty with [[Doge]] [[Nakha Urus|Urus]], only to be called by Windu to assist him with the scouting. The two soon discovered a gigantic creature whose armored skin was impervious even to lightsabers, the [[Zillo Beast]], from which they fled, only to be told by Urus that they wanted it killed, even though it was previously thought to be extinct. With the use of [[RX-200 Falchion-class assault tank|RX-200 ''Falchion''-class assault tanks]], the Republic forces put the creature to [[sleep]], convincing the Dugs that it was dead. With the treaty signed and Malastare now a member of the Republic, Palpatine ordered that the beast be shipped to Coruscant for study, despite Windu's objections.<ref name=\"Zillo Beast 1\">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Zillo Beast was brought to the Republic capital, Kenobi and Amidala asked Skywalker to speak with Palpatine about the fate of the creature; reluctantly, he agreed. When both he and Amidala met with the Chancellor, Palpatine and the [[Vice Chair]] [[Mas Amedda]] tried to justify that killing the beast was for the greater good\u2014Amidala objected to their claims, but Skywalker chose to stay neutral, instead of opposing either his wife, Amidala, or his friend, Palpatine. Although Palpatine claimed that he wished to kill the beast, he in fact wanted to research it as he was intrigued by the durability of the Zillo beast's armour. However, the beast [[Zillo Beast incident|escaped]] from captivity in Dr. [[Sionver Boll|Boll's]] laboratory and directly targeted the Chancellor himself for his attempts to kill it. Cornered by the beast, Skywalker and the others evacuated his office on his [[H-2 executive shuttle|executive shuttle]], only for the beast to grab it upon take-off. They were freed when Skywalker sliced the shuttle in half, causing everyone to fall out of the shuttle, with Skywalker saving Amidala from falling from the [[Galactic Senate Building|Senate Building's]] roof.

Believing Senator [[Rush Clovis]] to be a Separatist supporter, they decided they needed a spy\u2014in this case, Senator Amidala, of whom Clovis was an old friend. The next day, Skywalker met Amidala in the Senate and asked her about Clovis, who initially refused to do it until she heard that Clovis could be a Separatist. Skywalker accompanied her to the Jedi Council, where the Masters encouraged her to find out about his possible treachery. After learning that he was planning to go to Cato Neimoidia, Skywalker dressed as the pilot of Padm\u00e9's starship and took them there, all the while frustrating Clovis's attempts to get closer to his wife.<ref name=\"Senate Spy\">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mission to Cato Neimoidia|mission]], Skywalker and R2-D2 waited for Amidala to give them a signal; when she did, Skywalker sneaked into her quarters, where he saw Amidala and Clovis embracing.

It was soon after that the [[poison]] that Amidala had been given by [[Lott Dod]] began to set in, and she passed out. After Dod revealed to Clovis she was a spy, he helped Skywalker take her back to their ship, back to Coruscant, and forced Dod to give him the antidote, only for Skywalker to leave Clovis behind, stranded on the planet.<ref name=\"Senate Spy\" />\n\n====Second Battle of Geonosis====\n{{Quote|I knew they were still alive.

Intending to make a three-pronged attack against the shield generator, Skywalker, Tano and the 501st Legion set out to attack the Separatist defense lines from the south to reach the rendezvous point\u2014with only Kenobi's forces arriving at the landing zone, as both Mundi's and Skywalker's transports were shot down and forced to make their way to Kenobi's position by foot. Though they encountered resistance, Skywalker's team met up with Mundi's forces. After contacting Yularen to deploy a squadron of [[BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber|BTL-B Y-wings]] to help them, they reunited with Kenobi and his company, where they planned the assault on the shield generator.<ref name=\"Landing at Point Rain\" />\n\nThey then improvised on their plan; leading the charge, Skywalker and Tano disabled the enemy cannons with [[Electro Magnetic Pulse grenade|EMP grenades]], enabling the AT-TEs to destroy the shield generator; as the gunships arrived, the Geonosians in the area surrendered. Though Mundi and Kenobi left for medical treatment,<ref name=\"Landing at Point Rain\" /> the Republic forces continued pushing towards the massive droid foundry, and Skywalker and Tano were joined by Luminara Unduli and her Padawan, [[Barriss Offee]], who met as Skywalker and Tano angrily discussed Skywalker's lack of trust in Tano's dependability. As Offee and Tano were sent into the Geonosian catacombs under the factory to plant explosives, Unduli realized that Skywalker was unable to let go of Tano and put her at risk, rather than distrusting her. Nevertheless, the two Jedi generals went onto distracting the droid army by marching straight to the factory and engage the enemy.<ref name=\"Weapons Factory\">{{TCW|Weapons Factory}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Poggle the Lesser]] had his [[super tank]]s deployed, Skywalker and Luminara left their men behind and destroyed the bridge, only to learn that their Padawans had not returned yet. Cornered by droids coming from the factory, Skywalker was contacted by Tano and she apologized, uncertain that she and Offee would survive their ordeal, before using a super tank to destroy the factory. Refusing to let his Padawan die, Skywalker ordered to have them found; Unduli, however, told him that he needed to let go of his attachment to her if she were to be dead. Fortunately for them, Skywalker was contacted by Tano; after locating them, they rescued the two Padawans.<ref name=\"Weapons Factory\" />\n\n[[File:JediEscapeKarina.png|thumb|right|278px|Skywalker and Luminara Unduli escaping from Karina's brainless servants]]\nSending Tano and Offee to recover out of the battlefield, Kenobi and Mundi returned to join in the clean-up of Separatist forces. For her part, Unduli left in search of Poggle before he could escape, when a [[sandstorm]] broke out. Forced to wait until the storm lifted after her last contact, Skywalker and Kenobi went to Unduli's last known location, the [[Progate Temple]]. Entering the catacombs below, not only they discovered [[Zombie|undead Geonosian warriors]], they also encountered the captive Unduli, Poggle and the Geonosian [[Queen]], [[Karina the Great]]. Setting up their men to surround the Queen and her brethren, Skywalker and Kenobi tried to negotiate with Karina, for Kenobi wanted to know how the undead warriors were created.

He demanded that Poggle answer his questions with a mind trick, but the [[archduke]] informed him that it would have no effect on a Geonosian like him. It was then that Skywalker resorted to physical violence, attacking the captive Geonosian; with Poggle still unwilling to talk, Skywalker gave in to his anger and began to [[Force choke]] him. Only then did Poggle tell the Jedi Knight, through a [[TC-326|translator droid]], that the worms were affected by the cold. Skywalker relayed this information to his Padawan, telling her through her [[comlink]] to rupture the cooling system.

Skywalker and his Padawan then went to the Judiciary Detention Center to question Ziro, who was tricked by Tano into confessing that he had hired Sing for the job.

Skywalker tried to ease her mind, telling her that the party would work out and that she should relax, when they saw C-3PO being fuzzy about the arrangements. At Amidala's request, Skywalker sent the protocol droid and R2-D2 to buy the [[jogan fruit]] that the latter had forgotten to buy for Aang's favorite dessert, [[jogan fruitcake]].

Amidala, however, rejected the idea, for she was preparing an important bill for the Senate. Skywalker retorted that the bill seemed more important than their love, but Amidala countered that it wasn't, just that they both lived to serve the Republic. However, Skywalker stated that there was nothing more important than the way he felt about her, and proved it by giving Amidala his lightsaber, which, Kenobi had told him once, was his \"life.\" Though she believed he was teasing her, Skywalker was sincere about his feelings, and the two shared a kiss.<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\" />\n\n[[File:Padme_uses_lightsaber.png|thumb|right|264px|Amidala, using Skywalker's lightsaber to free him]]\nThey were soon interrupted by C-3PO and Senator Organa's voices, prompting Skywalker to hide under her desk and Amidala to hide his lightsaber in her sleeve.

Following her, Skywalker saw the situation, when Bane spotted him and sent his henchmen to capture him, but Skywalker avoided them long enough to contact Palpatine and defeat an [[IG-86 sentinel droid]] empty-handed, before being shocked into unconsciousness by [[Robonino]] and Aurra Sing and brought before the Senators. After the bounty hunters planted bombs that would go off if their laser detectors were triggered and left the building, Skywalker woke up and Amidala returned his lightsaber.

Skywalker then took one of the Separatist agents while Amidala discovered a list of anti-Separatist senators. Skywalker and Amidala discovered that along with Amidala, Synata planned to kill them with [[Dioxis]] gas. Skywalker and Amidala fought several LEP servant droids to stop Synata from killing the senators.

After an apparent Separatist [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|attack]], Skywalker confronted his apprentice about her and Amidala's meeting with [[Onderon]]'s senator [[Mina Bonteri]] on [[Raxus Secundus]] and how foolish it was.

Skywalker and Kenobi questioned Mother [[Talzin]], who told them his name\u2014Savage Opress\u2014and whereabouts. The two Jedi then headed to [[Toydaria]] where they confronted Opress, but failed to stop him from killing [[King]] [[Katuunko]].

Though they both made it to the rendezvous point, neither Rex's nor the Jedi's ship could see each other. In fact, the Jedi's ship was guided to a mysterious planet, [[Mortis]], where they met by a [[Force wielder|mysterious figure]] called the [[Daughter]], who asked Skywalker if he was \"the one\" and who wanted to lead them to the [[Father (Mortis)|Father]], when Skywalker was separated from Kenobi and Tano, and the Daughter.<ref name=\"Overlords\" />\n\nSkywalker tried to follow her, only to reach the [[Mortis monastery|monastery]], where he met the Father and was given shelter for the night. As he tried to sleep, the figure of his mother, Shmi, appeared before him and encouraged him to tell her of his pain and guilt\u2014that he was too late to save her, and that he had failed as a Jedi and that he had failed her, having tasted only vengeance when he slaughtered so many to avenge her death. But, as he mentioned his wife, who he claimed was \"everything\" to him, the figure finally revealed itself to be the [[Son]], briefly assuming a monstrous appearance before disappearing.<ref name=\"Overlords\" />\n\n[[File:TestOfTheOne-Overlords.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker, proving himself to be the Chosen One]]\nShaken by the encounter, he confronted the Father, who told of his family's history, and wondered if he was truly the Chosen One. Though Skywalker dismissed the prophecy as a myth, the Father arranged a test to see whether the Jedi Knight was fit to fulfill his destiny. Ordering his children to kill Tano and Kenobi, the Father goaded Skywalker into choosing between his master and his apprentice, but Skywalker instead controlled the two beings, bringing them to their knees. Having proved himself to be the Chosen One, the Father pleaded with him to stay, but Skywalker refused, leaving with Tano and Kenobi on their [[Jedi shuttle 634|shuttle]].<ref name=\"Overlords\" />\n\nThey were interrupted when the Son kidnapped Tano, prompting Skywalker to pursue him, at the cost of damaging their ship near Son's cathedral. Despite Kenobi's reservations, Skywalker went after his Padawan and climbed the tower to find Tano, corrupted by the dark side. Skywalker fought her, soon to be joined by Kenobi, only to be interrupted by the Father's arrival. Kenobi tried to hand Skywalker the [[Dagger of Mortis]], but Tano grabbed it and gave it to the Son, who killed her, for she was no longer useful; the dark side user then mortally wounded his sister as she stepped in to save her Father. Skywalker begged the Father to save Tano, and the dying Daughter used Skywalker as a conduit to channel the last of her life force into Tano, resurrecting her.

On their meeting, the Father was determined to kill Son, but refused Skywalker's offer of aid, telling the Jedi Knight to look inside himself for the answer for what was to be done. Leaving him, Skywalker encountered the [[Force spirit]] of his first mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn. Though Skywalker sought his advice, Jinn advised him to remember his training and trust his instincts, and to go to the [[Well of the Dark Side]] to face his most personal challenge. There, the Son forced Skywalker to confront his future, one consumed by the dark side. Horrified, Skywalker submitted to the Son as he promised him the power to avert this destiny. Soon, Kenobi arrived, and Skywalker left him trapped at the well, claiming to have seen the truth\u2014that it was the Jedi who would stand in the way of peace.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Mortis\">{{TCW|Ghosts of Mortis}}</ref>\n\nSkywalker arrived as his Padawan disabled the ship and went to rescue Kenobi, while the Son went to steal the Dagger. As Skywalker waited, the Father appeared before him and recognized that his son had broken the rules of [[time]]; he wiped Skywalker's memory of these future visions, leaving him unconscious, and brought him to his monastery. Skywalker awoke to find the Father, Kenobi, and Tano, moments before the Son arrived with the Dagger. To end the conflict, the Father impaled himself to distract his Son, while Skywalker killed the Son with his lightsaber. As the Father also died, he warned Skywalker to be wary of his feelings as they could lead to his downfall. As was noted by the Father,<ref name=\"Ghosts of Mortis\" /> Skywalker had brought balance to the Force<ref name=\"Join the Battle\" /> on Mortis through the deaths of the Force wielders, and he still had a chance to do so for the full galaxy.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Mortis\" />\n\nAfter the Father's death, the three Jedi were transplanted back to the galaxy to finally rendezvous with Rex.

The team was split into two\u2014while Kenobi's team created a diversion, Skywalker would lead the others away. In Tarkin's company, Skywalker and his team escaped through the cavern system below the prison, when Tarkin expressed some skepticism about the Jedi's plan, to which Skywalker told Tarkin that he reserved his trust to those who understood gratitude.<ref name=\"The Citadel\" /> However, they soon found common ground, for they both believed the Jedi Code prevented the Order from going far enough to achieve victory in the ongoing war,<ref name=\"Counterattack\">{{TCW|Counterattack}}</ref> and Tarkin developed a grudging appreciation for Skywalker.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nAs they made their way out of the fuel line to rendezvous with R2-D2 and the shuttle, they were attacked by droids and forced to join Kenobi at their pick-up point, with the shuttle heavily guarded.

As Rex observed Dogma was \"wound tight but loyal,\" Skywalker joked that he reminded him of Rex, who disagreed, saying that was him in the old days.<ref name=\"Darkness on Umbara\" />\n\nShortly after this, the [[Umbaran]]s ambushed Skywalker and his troops, but an airstrike by Master Krell and [[CC-2237|Odd Ball]] saved them. After the quick save, Krell approached Skywalker with a disconcerting message: the Council had ordered Skywalker back to Coruscant, effective immediately, as requested by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, for reasons unknown. Though reluctant to leave his troops in the midst of battle, Skywalker was forced to relinquish command over his troops to Master Krell and make the journey back to Coruscant.<ref name=\"Darkness on Umbara\" /> Despite Krell's efforts to sabotage the Republic effort by tricking the 501st and the [[212th Attack Battalion|212th battalions]] into attacking each other, Kenobi was successful in taking the capital and routing the remaining Umbaran forces, securing all sectors of the planet for the Republic.<ref name=\"Carnage of Krell\">{{TCW|Carnage of Krell}}</ref>\n\n====Kiros====\n{{Quote|Zygerrian ''scum!''

After landing, suspicious of the lack of colonists in the [[Artisan colony|town]], they used [[BARC speeder]]s to [[Battle of Kiros|break through]] the city and surround the [[governor's tower]], used as the Separatist Headquarters. The enemy commander, [[Darts D'Nar]], then sent a message to Kenobi to discuss terms of surrender. Skywalker then took the holoprojector out of Cody's hand and called D'Nar \"[[Zygerrian]] scum.\" Though Skywalker wanted to deal with the slaver himself, Kenobi told him to locate the missing colonists while he negotiated. As Skywalker contacted Admiral Yularen to conduct a planetary bioscan to find them, Kenobi explained Skywalker's behavior to Tano.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\">{{TCW|Kidnapped}}</ref>\n\nOverhearing from Kenobi's negotiations that D'Nar had planted [[Thermal annihilator bomb|bombs]] throughout the city, Skywalker and Tano set out to disarm them. Despite [[Sharpshooter droideka|sniper droids]], they destroyed the bombs in the nick of time, just for Kenobi to tell them D'Nar was escaping on the ''[[Tecora]]''. With some effort, they managed to board the ship, inside which D'Nar pitted a [[blixus]] against them, but Skywalker managed to throw it off the ship, while Tano bested D'Nar in the cockpit. Soon, Skywalker joined her and, with frightening intensity, threatened the Zygerrian into revealing the colonists' location, much to Tano's surprise. However, it proved effective as D'Nar revealed that his Queen would hold the Royal Slave Auction.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\" />\n\n====Zygerria====\n{{Quote|A most curious Jedi who cares more about his friends than his own mission.

He quickly won Scintel's favor, with the Queen inviting him to accompany her during the slave auction, where she intended to have Skywalker prove himself a slaver by torturing Kenobi.<ref name=\"Slaves of the Republic\">{{TCW|Slaves of the Republic}}</ref>\n\nInstead, he freed Kenobi and tried to escape with R2-D2 returning their lightsabers, Rex providing cover fire and Tano confronting the Queen. Despite their efforts, however, they were subdued, but Scintel saw Skywalker's determination, for five [[electro-whip]]s were needed to reduce him. Despite Dooku and half her kingdom demanding his death, Scintel had Skywalker brought to her quarters. There he woke up and interrogated Scintel about his friends' whereabouts, while he throttled the Queen with the Force. However, Scintel gasped that his friends would die unless he obeyed her, and Skywalker was forced to comply and become her bodyguard and escort, just as she became infatuated by him.<ref name=\"Slaves of the Republic\" />\n\n[[File:Burst_of_Lightning_AtG.png|thumb|left|236px|Dooku blasts Skywalker with Force lightning]]\nAfter a few days, Dooku would arrive, and Skywalker observed that she too was a slave to the Count, before she left to receive the Sith Lord. With the help of R2-D2, he escaped his guards and freed Tano from her cage and sent her to prep the ship, while he interrogated Scintel to tell him Kenobi and Rex's location. However, he found himself before [[Atai Molec]], who had betrayed Scintel, and Dooku, with whom Skywalker futilely dueled before Dooku blamed him of killing Scintel before her guards. Skywalker then took Scintel and escaped to the ''Tecora'', aboard which she told him Kenobi was in the [[Kadavo system]] and that she, just like Skywalker, was a slave, before dying.<ref name=\"Escape from Kadavo\">{{TCW|Escape from Kadavo}}</ref>\n\nAfter contacting Plo Koon to send reinforcements, Skywalker and Tano soon reached [[Kadavo]] and entered the [[Kadavo slave processing facility|slave-processing facility]]. During the [[Battle of Kadavo|battle]] that ensued, Skywalker disabled the turrets that were attacking Koon and his forces, while Tano saved the Togruta colonists from falling to their death (as caused by [[Keeper]] [[Agruss]]) by placing Admiral [[Barton Coburn]]'s [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser]] ''[[Hand of Justice]]'' underneath the facility. Along with Rex and Kenobi, Skywalker evacuated the facility before it was destroyed on Koon's orders, before returning to the rest of Koon's fleet.<ref name=\"Escape from Kadavo\" />\n\n====Palpatine kidnapped====\n{{Quote|Skywalker, a powerful Jedi you are, yet unpredictable and dangerous you can be, to both your friends and enemies.

On their way to the Temple, however, a [[sniper]] opened fire at them, which prompted the three Jedi to chase their aggressor. However, the sniper killed Kenobi before escaping on a speeder, prompting Skywalker to return to his master, to find Tano crying and his old master dead, whom he called several times trying to get him to respond. Becoming withdrawn and grim, Skywalker wouldn't say a word since then, until after the [[Funeral of Obi-Wan Kenobi|funeral]] held to honor Kenobi, when he went on a self-imposed mission to locate his murderer, [[Rako Hardeen]], at [[Trueping's]]. Though Skywalker would rather kill him, he arrested Hardeen and ferried him to the Republic Detention Center.<ref name=\"Deception\" />\n\nAfter hearing that Hardeen had [[Riot at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|escaped]] from jail, Skywalker held a meeting with his friend, Palpatine, when Windu informed the Chancellor that they would remove the bounty on Hardeen and the two other escapees, Eval and Cad Bane; a decision did not sit well with Skywalker. Palpatine suggested that the Council perhaps did not trust him to control his feelings, and Skywalker felt the Council was doing nothing to catch the murderer of his master\u2014his best friend. Exploiting this to his advantage, Palpatine told him not to deny his feelings, for they were what made him special, and deliberately sent Skywalker and Tano to [[Nal Hutta]]. There, two Jedi harshly interrogated locals for information, which led them to [[Orondia]], the fugitives last known location.<ref name=\"Friends and Enemies\">{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}}</ref>\n\nAfter spotting their quarry as they prepare to leave, Skywalker rammed [[YV-666 light freighter|their ship]] into submission and board it in midflight, but was foiled by Bane and a subsequent crash-landing of both parties resulting from the chase. Surrounded by smoke, Hardeen left the ship, and Skywalker [[Showdown on Orondia|confronted]] him, ready to kill Hardeen when Bane interrupted him. Hardeen intervened then and wrestled with Skywalker, whispering to Skywalker's ear \"Anakin, don't follow me.\" As he felt a connection, Skywalker passed out, only for Tano to protect him for Bane's attempts to execute him.<ref name=\"Friends and Enemies\" /> As they returned to Coruscant, Yoda summoned Skywalker to his chambers and revealed the truth to him\u2014that Kenobi was \"Rako Hardeen.\"<ref name=\"The Box\">{{TCW|The Box}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Theed_banquet_hall.jpg|thumb|left|288px|Skywalker and Count Dooku rematch on Naboo.]]\nAfterwards, Skywalker was briefed along his Padawan about the security plans the Council had for the Chancellor during the [[Festival of Light]] on Naboo. Skywalker, Tano, and Windu would escort the Palpatine and Mas Amedda to Theed, where Skywalker was greeted by his wife. At the festival itself, the abduction was initially successful with Cad Bane and Moralo Eval ferrying Palpatine away, while Skywalker and Windu captured Embo and [[Twazzi]]; however, Kenobi stopped Eval and Bane, long enough for Windu and Skywalker to arrive and take the two into custody.<ref name=\"Crisis on Naboo\">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>\n\nAs he reunited with his old master, he voiced his resentment for the Council's lack of trust in him as well as Kenobi's decision to hide the truth from him. Wondering how many other lies he had been told by the Council, he set out on his own to bodyguard Palpatine, who continued to place seeds of doubt in Skywalker until they were greeted by Dooku. After destroying two of his MagnaGuards, Skywalker [[Skirmish in Theed|dueled]] the Count with ferocity, until Kenobi arrived to help him rescue the Chancellor, whereas Dooku fled.<ref name=\"Crisis on Naboo\" />\n\n====A phantom menace====\n{{Quote|I sense a disturbance.

They went to the crime scene, where they met [[Russo-ISC]], whom Skywalker sent alongside Tano to interview the witnesses, whereas he meditated at the hangar. Unable to discover anything, he met up with Tano, who told him about their missing suspect, [[Jackar Bowmani]], a clue which, in turn, led to his wife, [[Letta Turmond]], who under pressure admitted to feeding Bowmani with [[NM-K reconstitutor|nano-droids]], but would not reveal her motives.<ref name=\"Sabotage\">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)|Sabotage}}</ref>\n\nSkywalker was present at [[Funeral of the Jedi Temple bombing victims|Yoda's eulogy for the six Jedi who died during the explosion]], and later took the opportunity to speak with Tarkin.

He was outraged to learn that the Council had already made their decision and that the meeting was simply a formality, and they proceeded to expel her from the Order.

As Anakin and Rex entered the warehouse, they dropped their weapons on Fives' request. After doing so, they were encircled by a ray shield, which prompted Skywalker to question Fives' actions, but he and Rex listened to the fugitive's side of the story. Skywalker refused to believe that the Chancellor was involved in this conspiracy about the [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]], but their conversation was cut short by the arrival of the [[Coruscant Guard]].

Upon his return to Coruscant after the battle, Skywalker could find records of Amidala's travels in the Outer Rim. After another battle, Skywalker received a message that Amidala's ship was found on Batuu. Skywalker, along with [[R2-D2]], took his [[Anakin Skywalker's Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|interceptor]] to Batuu. En route to Batuu, Skywalker encountered a [[freighter]].

After speaking with the bartender, Skywalker and Thrawn came under attack by four assailants. The two of them were able to kill the assailants. Thrawn suspected the assailants were sent to kill Skywalker and that there was the fifth nearby. Skywalker and Thrawn came up with a plan to capture the last assailant.

They learned that they were shipping supplies to a droid [[Mokivj droid factory|factory]]. After learning of Duja's death, Skywalker told Thrawn about the politics behind the Clone Wars. Skywalker and Thrawn traveled to [[Mokivj]]. There, they discovered that the Separatists were mining [[Cortosis]].<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nSkywalker and Thrawn were captured by Solha's droids and taken to a prison cell.

Though he demanded that she step away from her assignment, she refused and left with Clovis. Frustrated, Skywalker went to his quarters, where Kenobi (at the behest of Yoda) spoke to him, revealing that he was well aware of Skywalker's feelings for Amidala, and asked his former apprentice not to let himself carried away by them before leaving. Later that night, Skywalker went to his wife's apartment, where he found Clovis about to kiss her, for which Skywalker briefly Force choked him\u2014before giving him a one-sided beatdown despite Amidala's protests, willing to kill Clovis in his jealousy.<ref name=\"The Rise of Clovis\" />\n\nBefore it was too late, he realized his mistake and stopped, only for Captain Typho to enter. Much to his surprise, Clovis lied about the attack. As they carried Clovis to Amidala's bedroom, Skywalker tried to apologize to his wife, but she told him to stay away from her. Only when they were alone afterward, she questioned their marriage, too steeped in lies and deception, and decided that they take a break from one another after admitting to not feeling safe around Skywalker\u2014who, in turn, admitted to being unable to control himself, even though he did not know why.<ref name=\"The Rise of Clovis\" />\n\nClovis was accepted as the new head of the Banking Clan by the Senate, and Skywalker confided to the Chancellor of his distrust in Clovis, which Palpatine shared.<ref name=\"The Rise of Clovis\" /> Soon, when Clovis apparently joined the Separatists the day after (which Skywalker found strange), and Scipio was occupied by Separatists, Skywalker was then sent to [[Invasion of Scipio|retake]] Scipio.

At that very moment, though, a vulture droid crashed into the office, making it unstable and causing Amidala and Clovis to fall, but Skywalker grabbed them both, each with one hand. As he could not hold the two, Clovis told Skywalker to let go of him, but he wouldn't; Clovis apologized to Amidala and then let go of Skywalker, falling to his death.

Relaunching the investigation of Sifo-Dyas's death, Skywalker and Kenobi were sent to Felucia, where they spoke to the tribal leaders to find out what happened to the late Jedi Master. Kenobi was told that the Felucians had cremated his body and that another Jedi had been with him when he was killed and reported their findings to Master Yoda.<ref name=\"The Lost One\">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EpGuide610.png|thumb|right|288px|Kenobi and Skywalker's meeting with the leader of the Pyke Syndicate]]\nThe two were then [[Mission to Oba Diah (Clone Wars)|sent]] to [[Oba Diah]] when former Chancellor, [[Finis Valorum]] told Yoda that Sifo-Dyas had been [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre\u2013Naboo Crisis)|sent]] to negotiate with the [[Pyke Syndicate]] to stop an underground war. Valorum, however, said that there was no other Jedi sent alongside Syfo-Dyas, but rather his personal aide [[Silman]]. On Oba Diah, Kenobi and Skywalker met [[Lom Pyke]], who denied any involvement until Kenobi noticed that he was wearing the crest of Valorum and Skywalker grabbed the necklace and told the [[Pyke]] to \"stop playing games.\" Lom finally complied with the Jedi, and told them that they had been paid by a man called Tyranus to shoot Sifo-Dyas's shuttle down. However, as they feared that anyone who paid for the death of a Jedi was dangerous, they kept Silman locked away for ten years as insurance.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\nOnce they met Silman, they realized he had gone mad after being locked up for so long, and were unable to learn much from him before Dooku arrived to kill him before Skywalker and Kenobi's eyes. After engaging Dooku in combat, they learned that the man called Tyranus was, in fact, the Count. Although Skywalker pursued the count after he tried to escape on a [[Coruscant Freighter]], Dooku escaped aboard his [[solar sailer]], leaving the Jedi without the chance to learn more about the clone army. Nevertheless having learned the identity of Tyranus, they informed the Council of their findings, only for them to question why Dooku had been behind the creation of the clone army, and what the game of the yet-unidentified [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] was playing.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\n====Yoda's journey====\n{{Quote|Help me to escape.

As Skywalker, too, was in disbelief of the idea that an individual could retain its identity after death, Yoda left him to rest. Later, when Yoda submitted himself for medical examination by [[Rig Nema]], Skywalker informed them that Chancellor Palpatine wanted to hold an emergency meeting with Yoda, to which Windu responded, leaving the Grand Master free to undergo a [[deprivation ritual]].

Once they landed on [[Pau City]], [[Inspector]] [[Jen June]] led them to see the corpse at the [[Pau City Morgue|morgue]]. After examining the body, they went to the place where she had been found, only to determine she had been hit in the optic nerve with a [[Vilmarh's Revenge|precision laser dart]] by a sniper. As they found the sniper's position, from the building's owner, [[Garri]], the two Jedi learned of the involvement of MagnaGuards and began to suspect the involvement of General Grievous, and had Inspector June analyze some slimy substance they had found\u2014the secretion of an [[Amani]]'s skin.<ref name=\"A Death on Utapau\">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A_Death_on_Utapau_Ep.png|thumb|right|281px|Kenobi and Skywalker speaking to Inspector June]]\nThough Governor [[Torul Blom]] asked them to leave Utapau, Kenobi and Skywalker persevered and rented two [[dactillion]]s to go talk to the leader of an Amani tribe, who revealed that an Amani outcast had entered one of the caves. The two Jedi entered it to find MagnaGuards. Despite some resistance, they managed to have the droids reveal the involvement of the [[Sugi]] and went to see Inspector June once again. Soon after, the two attended the [[Funeral of Tu-Anh|funeral]] for Tu-Anh.<ref name=\"A Death on Utapau\" />\n\nAs they reached the Amani settlement they had been looking for, the Amani scattered, leaving Skywalker and Kenobi to follow the tracks of one that appeared to be their leader. During the hunt, Skywalker mentioned Tano for the first time since her departure, and Kenobi asked if he wanted to talk about it, yet Skywalker refused. Kenobi then suggested for them to set up a camp and rest. However, he insisted on the subject, prompting Skywalker to tell Kenobi he missed Tano and to voice his anger at the High Council for turning its back on her. To Skywalker's annoyance, Kenobi stood by the Council's authority, asserting that it had been Tano's decision to leave and that she had allowed her emotions to cloud her judgment, something against the Jedi way. Then, Kenobi suggested he rest, but Skywalker declined so that he could keep the first watch. Finally, he questioned Kenobi on what would happen if he had turned out to be a \"major disappointment,\" but Kenobi wanted to believe it would never happen.<ref name=\"In Search of the Crystal\">{{TCW|In Search of the Crystal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal_Crisis_Ep.png|thumb|left|286px|Kenobi and Skywalker defending a massive kyber crystal]]\nHowever, they both fell asleep and were captured by a group of Sugis led by [[Chong]], who brought them before [[Endente]] as Kenobi told Chong of their \"intention\" to buy weapons. They learned Endente was, in fact, selling a [[kyber crystal]], and Skywalker prompted him to show it before they made the deal. Brought to the starship where the [[crystal]] was being kept, they escaped from their captors, and Skywalker eliminated all the Sugi, except for Endente, who fled. After they discovered the massive kyber crystal inside the ship,<ref name=\"In Search of the Crystal\" /> the two Jedi managed to transport the crystal through Utapau's plains until they reached Pau City, where Blom had the two Jedi surrounded with his men and Grievous's droids. As the kyber crystal was loaded into a shuttle and sent to a ship on [[orbit]], Kenobi and Skywalker stole a [[Unidentified freighter (Utapau)|freighter]] to recover the crystal.<ref name=\"Crystal Crisis\">{{TCW|Crystal Crisis}}</ref>\n\nDuring the persecution, Grievous damaged their ship, forcing them to perform a [[number five special]]; they crashed it to disable the hyperdrive and, with their escape pods, boarded the ship where the crystal was then held. As they got separated, Kenobi was captured by Grievous, and Skywalker recovered his lightsaber, located the crystal and freed Kenobi. Together, they made their way to the kyber crystal at the vault, where they were temporarily trapped until a squad discovered them. Using the crystal and the Force to knock them out, he managed to get to a hangar, where Skywalker stole a shuttle to escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi set several [[Armored Assault Tank Mk I|AATs]] to shoot and overload the crystal, destroying the crystal and the ship, while they escaped from the explosion in the nick of time and returned to Coruscant to report to the Council.<ref name=\"The Big Bang\" />\n\n====Stationed on Coruscant====\n{{Quote|Should I send a detachment, General?''\"<br />\"''[...] No. It's nothing.|Yularen and Skywalker, as the latter senses Ahsoka Tano|Deal No Deal}}\nSometime later, while on a ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer, Skywalker discovered an unknown ship, the ''[[Silver Angel]]'', in military airspace.

Ventress staged a [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|rescue mission]], which failed and prompted her to contact the Jedi Council. When she arrived at the Jedi Temple, Skywalker and Kenobi escorted her to the [[Jedi Council Chamber|Council Chamber]], where despite Mace Windu's open disapproval, Yoda dispatched Skywalker and Kenobi to go with Ventress to [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|rescue]] Vos above [[Taris]].

Skywalker then engaged in a duel with the Count, distracting him while Kenobi and Ventress discovered a captive Vos. Though she knew Vos was consumed by his hatred, they escaped to the ''Banshee'', and Skywalker joined with them to escape the enemy ship and return to Coruscant. Back in the Jedi Temple, Skywalker saw as the Council welcomed Vos and pardoned Ventress. That same night, Skywalker reunited with his wife, Amidala, for a moment of respite, during which Skywalker told her of the ordeal\u2014after which, Amidala conferred that perhaps Ventress's love could be Vos's way back from the dark side, leaving Skywalker at a loss for words.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nA month later, Skywalker was sent alongside Kenobi, Vos, and Akar-Deshu in a [[Destruction of the Separatist supply storage base|mission]] to take over a [[Separatist supply storage base]] and redistribute the supplies to worlds in need of them. However, their mission went awry when Vos, unbeknownst to them, arranged the base's destruction. After another [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|failed mission]] to Vos's name, he was suspected of treason, Skywalker and Kenobi were sent to spy on Vos and Ventress as they were deployed to assassinate Dooku during the [[second battle of Christophsis]]. When they saw Vos attempt to force the Count to lead him to his master, Darth Sidious, rather than kill him, Skywalker and Kenobi intervened, taking the pair by surprise and arresting them.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nHowever, Vos and Dooku soon escaped from the [[Vigilance (Venator-class)|''Vigilance'']], causing the death of Akar-Deshu and [[Kav Bayons]], and boarded Ventress' ship ''Banshee'' to escape Christophsis. Skywalker had the ''Banshee'' fired on, forcing the renegades to land on the planet below. He and Kenobi pursued the three injured fugitives to a [[Christophsis Separatist tower|Separatist-controlled tower]], where they surrounded them. There, Skywalker and Kenobi witnessed Ventress' last moments, sacrificing herself to save Vos from Dooku's fatal [[Force lightning]]. After her death, Skywalker and Kenobi were joined by the redeemed Vos, and they tried to capture Dooku, to no avail.

With mounting losses on the Republic side, Captain Rex told Skywalker and Windu his theory that the Separatists had learned his own strategy. Considering this possibility, Windu sent Rex and Commander Cody to take a squad, and [[Clone Force 99]], behind enemy lines to infiltrate a Separatist [[Cyber Center]] while he and Skywalker held the line.<ref name=\"The Bad Batch\">{{TCW|The Bad Batch (episode)|The Bad Batch}}</ref> The general staff was told about the possibility of sending a [[Mission to Skako Minor|mission]] to [[Skako Minor]], and Skywalker was sure the Jedi High Council would approve it.

Although Rex was eager to get going, Skywalker informed him they had a \"thing\" to do, and, although Rex felt they did not have time, they both went to the barracks. Rex remained outside on watch while Skywalker, holding Rex's helmet, went in and contacted Amidala. Skywalker apologized for being away for so long, but, as the two spoke, Obi-Wan Kenobi approached Rex. The Clone Captain knocked on the door to speed up Skywalker. Skywalker confided that he was worried about his captain, worrying that Rex was letting his personal feelings drive him too much on the mission, although Amidala believed Rex had learned that trait from him. Outside, Rex tried to lie about what Skywalker was doing. However, Skywalker and her ended their conversation, and both went on their way to Skako, although Kenobi revealed he knew he had been talking to Amidala.<ref name=\"A Distant Echo\">{{TCW|A Distant Echo}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AnakinDistantEcho.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker, alongside Rex and Clone Force 99's leader, Hunter]]\nAs they reached Skako Minor on the ''[[Havoc Marauder]]'', Skywalker was captured by the [[Poletec]] on their [[keeradak]]s, prompting Rex and the Bad Batch to follow them to the village and rescue the Jedi General. They apologized and explained the situation, and the [[Qin Yazal|chief]] helped them reach [[Purkoll]], which they infiltrated with some effort. When they reached the antechamber, [[Foreman]] Wat Tambor sent a transmission saying they had violated the [[Techno Union]]'s neutrality, and sent droid reinforcements. While Skywalker, Hunter, [[Wrecker]], and [[CT-9904|Crosshair]] destroyed them, Rex and [[Tech]] found Echo\u2014alive, but as a cyborg.<ref name=\"A Distant Echo\" />\n\n[[File:Keeradaks.png|thumb|right|243px|Skywalker, Rex, Echo, and the Bad Batch escape the droid forces of the Techno Union.]]\nTech managed to unplug Echo, and they escaped to the ventilation system before being vaporized by Tambor's [[Decimator]], after which Wrecker destroyed the Foreman's main computers with explosives. As they escaped, however, they were surrounded by his [[D1-series aerial battle droid]]s, but thanks to Tech, they rode keeradaks to the [[Poletec village]]. There, they convinced the natives to help them against the Techno Union's forces, including their [[octuptarra tri-droid]]s, with Skywalker effectively destroying two of them.<ref name=\"On the Wings of Keeradaks\">{{TCW|On the Wings of Keeradaks}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the skirmish, Skywalker, Rex, and Clone Force 99 returned to [[Fort Anaxes]], where Windu and Kenobi were to take the Separatist [[Anaxes assembly complex|assembly complex]] by air, whereas Echo was to be escorted by the Bad Batch, Skywalker and Rex into Trench's communications vault on a dreadnought on the planet's orbit, where he would plug himself to the dreadnought to feed the Separatist's strategic movements. When Echo did so and deactivated the droids attacking the assembly complex, he realized that Trench had initiated a countdown for an explosion that could destroy most of Anaxes. While Kenobi assisted in the evacuation efforts, and Windu deactivated the bomb, Skywalker went to the dreadnought's bridge to confront Trench, destroying his droid bodyguards. Trench refused to give the final sequence number, believing that Skywalker would not harm him. Skywalker amputated Trench's prosthetic attachments, prompting the [[Harch]] to immediately give in. After relaying it to Windu, who deactivated the bomb, Trench then tried to electrocute him; in response, Anakin thrust his lightsaber through the Harch's chest, killing him. He then took the [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct]] detonator for the dreadnought and reunited with the rest of his team.<ref name=\"Unfinished Business\">{{TCW|Unfinished Business}}</ref>\n\nAs they left aboard the ''Havoc Marauder'', Skywalker let Wrecker destroy Trench's flagship, the ''[[Invulnerable]]'', damaging the nearby Separatist fleet, and they went back to Fort Anaxes.

While Kenobi and Commander Cody were taking cover from the blasts, Skywalker ordered his men to hide under the bridge, while R2-D2 would tell them when to launch. Next, Skywalker stepped into the fight and convinced his Master to follow his plan. Skywalker faked a surrender to draw out the [[Unidentified super tactical droid (Yerbana)|droid commander]], who saw through the lies of the Jedi Knight; however, it was too late, as Skywalker used his Force abilities to destroy the droid commander, allowing his 501st Legion led by Captain Rex to make a surprising ambush on the rest of the droid army, ending the conflict.<ref name=\"Old Friends Not Forgotten\" />\n\nThe 212th Attack Battalion proceeded to help the 501st while Skywalker was approached by Kenobi who complimented him, which Skywalker answered by thanking Kenobi for helping achieve victory.

Emotionally shocked to see his former apprentice after several months of being apart, Skywalker barely managed to control himself and proceeded to talk to Tano, who remarked the moment was not a reunion as Maul had been located on Mandalore and they had an opportunity to capture him.<ref name=\"Old Friends Not Forgotten\" />\n\nTano hoped Skywalker and Kenobi would be able to join forces with her to [[Siege of Mandalore|confront]] him.<ref name=\"Ahsoka\">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref> Tano, Kryze, and her Mandalorians boarded the ship, where they were greeted by Skywalker and Kenobi. The former tried to greet Tano, but his former apprentice turned him down saying they had to act immediately if they wanted to capture Maul. The group went to discuss the possible attack, but Kenobi was not willing to help Tano and her allies unless the Jedi Council gave their permission, causing Skywalker to unnoticeably scowl at him. While Kenobi contacted the Council, Skywalker had Tano accompanying him through the complex. Skywalker led Tano to a room full of the 501st clone troopers, including Rex, who had painted their helmets as a way to honor her former Commander. Skywalker then prepared to give Tano her old [[Ahsoka's lightsabers|lightsabers]], but before he could do so, the ship's alarm suddenly went off.<ref name=\"Old Friends Not Forgotten\" />\n\nKenobi rushed in and informed Skywalker and Rex that they would be jumping to hyperspace immediately. When Skywalker asked if this meant the attack on Mandalore was approved, Kenobi revealed that they were actually heading for Coruscant, where a dire situation was happening: General Grievous had launched a full-scale attack on the capital of the Republic, and the Jedi Council had lost contact with Shaak Ti, Chancellor Palpatine's assigned protector. Skywalker was visibly uncomfortable about this news, but Kenobi assured him that their fleet would arrive at Coruscant very soon.<ref name=\"Old Friends Not Forgotten\" />\n\nTano, however, was angered by her former Masters' decision to abandon Mandalore. Kenobi pointed out that they were entering a pivotal moment in the Clone Wars, but Tano countered that Kenobi was playing politics and that the Jedi Order had lost their way by forgetting that their duty was to help people and not politicians, which was why the people (and Tano herself) had lost faith in them. Skywalker heard the argument and weighed in. So as to help Tano in the upcoming siege without compromising Mandalore's neutrality and the mission to rescue the Chancellor, Skywalker promoted Rex to Commander so he could lead the mission and had Tano assisting him as an advisor. When Kenobi agreed, Tano accepted the proposal. Kenobi left the room to prepare their troops leaving Skywalker and Tano behind. Skywalker gave Tano her new lightsabers complimenting them as better than before. Skywalker then headed to rescue the Chancellor as this was now an opportunity to end the war. While he was leaving, Tano stopped him by wishing him good luck in his mission.

Assisted by a [[Clone Flight Squad Seven|squadron]] of [[Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter|ARC-170 starfighters]] led by Clone Commander Odd Ball, the two Jedi fought their way through a swarm of [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|Vulture]] and [[Droid tri-fighter|tri-fighter]] droid starfighters protecting the ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', General Grievous's flagship. Skywalker and Kenobi headed for the ship while the clones distracted the droids, but Kenobi's ship was damaged and partially disabled by [[Buzz-droid]]s. Although Kenobi told Skywalker to abandon him and complete the mission, the younger Jedi refused and cleared his former master's ship of droids before escorting him to the ''Invisible Hand''{{'s}} hangar. After crashing landing, the two Jedi disposed of the few remaining droids in the hangar while R2-D2 located the Chancellor. Once they discovered that he was being held at the top of the ship's observation spire, they concluded that they were walking into a trap when Skywalker sensed the presence of Count Dooku. Not long after they arrived at the top of the spire, the Sith Lord appeared before them and the two Jedi engaged him in a duel.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nDooku managed to gain the upper hand and knocked Kenobi out, but his taunting, intended to erode Skywalker's morale, instead enraged him. Skywalker unleashed his fury on the Sith Lord, brutally overwhelming him and slicing off both of his hands. Taking Dooku's lightsaber, he crossed both his and the Count's blades at the Count's throat, and Palpatine urged him to kill his helpless opponent. Skywalker initially hesitated, but after the Chancellor's continued insistence, he gave into his hatred of his nemesis and beheaded Dooku. He expressed regret afterward, stating it was not the [[Jedi Code|Jedi way]], but the Chancellor assured him that he had been right to kill the Count. Despite the Chancellor's pleas, he carried Kenobi on his back to make their escape. However, the elevators leaving the spire had been disabled. With help from R2 and the attack taking place on the ''Invisible Hand'' by a neighboring Republic cruiser, they were able to escape in the elevator shaft until the ship's crew was able to regain control of the ship, restoring its gravity and turning the shaft once more into well. Kenobi regained consciousness while they were hanging on inside the shaft and together, he and Skywalker were able to escape the shaft just as a reactivated elevator was about to crush them. However, their good fortune failed them, and they were trapped by a [[ray shield]] and apprehended, along with R2, by battle droids.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:FirstDate-ROTS.png|thumb|right|274px|Anakin meets Grievous.]]\nThe two Jedi and the Chancellor were brought before Grievous in the ''Invisible Hand''{{'s}} control room. The cyborg personally taunted them, derisively commenting on Skywalker's youth considering his reputation. Skywalker retorted with a taunt about the General being shorter than he had expected. Eventually, R2-D2 caused a distraction, allowing Kenobi to draw his lightsaber to him with the Force, freeing himself and then Skywalker. Once the younger Jedi had also summoned his weapon, they engaged and made short work of Grievous's MagnaGuards and the battle droids holding them and the Chancellor. However, as they attempted to apprehend Grievous, he used one the MagnaGuards' electrostaffs to shatter the viewport, depressurizing the bridge and letting the vacuum take him. Skywalker and Kenobi caught onto nearby command consoles until security measures allowed the bridge to repressurize. Before they could reach him, however, Grievous escaped, jettisoning all the escape pods to prevent them from escaping. As the command crew had fled, Skywalker took control of the damaged flagship, which had begun to enter Coruscant's atmosphere. Although he briefly managed to slow the ship's descent, the damage it had sustained proved too great, and the ''Invisible Hand'' broke in half, picking up considerable speed as it fell towards the Republic capital. Skywalker eventually succeeded in crash-landing the ''Invisible Hand'' on a deserted landing strip, returning the once-captive Chancellor to Coruscant unharmed.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Looming fatherhood====\n{{Quote|Are you all right?

He briefly spoke with Senator Organa, who expressed hope that Count Dooku's death could bring a quick end to the war. Skywalker disagreed, saying that as long as General Grievous remained as leader of the Separatist armies, the war would continue. At that moment, he noticed Amidala behind one of the columns, took his leave from the Senator and reunited with his wife for the first time in months.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Having been away fighting in the Outer Rim Sieges, Skywalker's single focus was reuniting with Amidala.<ref name=\"Episode III summary\">{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-3-revenge-of-the-sith-story-gallery|text=''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith'' Story Gallery}}</ref> Amidala then revealed to her husband that she was pregnant. Though they were both worried that this might expose their secret, Amidala especially, Skywalker was overjoyed and told her not to worry, saying that it was the happiest moment of his life. The couple returned to Amidala's apartment, where they began to make plans for when the baby would be born, deciding that their child would be raised on Naboo, in the [[Lake Country]]. Amidala also planned to head there before the birth, to prepare the room.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nHowever, that same night, Skywalker's happiness was marred when he suffered a nightmare of his wife dying in childbirth, similar to the visions he had had of his mother before her death. Although Amidala tried to comfort him that it was only a dream, he was terrified that he would lose her, as he had lost his mother. Amidala tried to convince him that they needed help and suggested they ask Kenobi for his assistance. Skywalker refused, insisting that their baby was a blessing, not a curse. The next day, at the Jedi Temple, he sought Yoda's counsel concerning these dreams, but the Grand Master told Skywalker that death was a natural part of life, and to let go of all that he was afraid to lose.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Tensions of loyalty====\n{{Quote|Is it possible to learn this power?''\"<br />\"''Not from a Jedi.|Skywalker and Palpatine discuss the power to stop people from dying|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\nAt the same time, tensions were rising between Chancellor Palpatine and the Jedi Council, who were concerned with his increasing power. Matters were made worse when the Senate announced that they planned to grant him more executive powers in order to facilitate the end of the war. When Skywalker was informed of this by Kenobi, he was supportive of the measure, despite the reservations of the Council and Kenobi's warning to be wary of Palpatine. He then told him that the Chancellor had requested his presence for unknown reasons, without informing the Council. So Skywalker met with Palpatine at his office, where he told him that he was appointing the young Jedi to be his personal representative on the Council, a decision that Skywalker believed the Jedi Masters would never accept. When informed of this, the Council allowed Skywalker to sit on the Council, yet they refused to grant him the position of Master, a decision which greatly angered Skywalker. Skywalker turned to his former Master and friend, Kenobi, expecting him to back him up, but he was caught between his friendship with Skywalker and his loyalty to the Council, and so remained silent. Angered more by this, Skywalker reluctantly accepted his position and took his seat on the council. At the end of the meeting, Kenobi acknowledged to Skywalker that his appointment had been accepted so that, on behalf of the Council, he could spy on the Chancellor, which Skywalker was reluctant to do.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Palpatine_and_Anakin.png|thumb|left|294px|Chancellor Palpatine recounting the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis to Skywalker]]\nAt the [[Galaxies Opera House]] in the [[Uscru District]], Skywalker joined Palpatine in watching the [[Mon Calamari Aquatic Ballet]] performing ''[[Squid Lake]]''. During the performance the Chancellor began to stir Skywalker's distrust in the Jedi council, deducing that they had asked Skywalker to spy on him. He claimed that the Jedi were only perceived as good because \"good is a point of view,\" stating that the Jedi and the Sith were not so different. Skywalker rebutted by saying that the Sith were selfish while the Jedi were selfless. The Chancellor recounted the [[Tragedy of Darth Plagueis]] to Skywalker, showing that not all Sith were as evil as the Jedi claimed while also tempting the Jedi with knowledge of the power to stop death. Afterward, Skywalker bid farewell to Kenobi, showing gratitude for his teachings and said to each other \"[[May the Force be with you]],\" before parting ways.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Fall to the dark side====\n{{Quote|A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth&hellip; Vader.|Darth Sidious to his apprentice|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\nIn a hologram meeting with Yoda, Cody, Ki-Adi Mundi, and Aayla Secura, Anakin and Mace Windu learned that Obi-Wan had engaged Grievous on Utapau. Anakin was tasked by Windu to inform the Chancellor and see what his reaction is in order to learn his true intentions. Skywalker informed the Chancellor of Kenobi's forces [[Battle of Utapau|engaging]] Grievous's, but during the meeting, Palpatine revealed that he knew the [[dark side of the Force]], leading Skywalker to realize that he was the Sith Lord they had been searching for. Palpatine told Anakin that if he turned him over to the Jedi, then he would be unable to aid in saving his wife, Amidala, from her \"fated\" death that Anakin had been dreaming of.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nDespite his confusion, Skywalker still was loyal to the Jedi Order. He told his findings to Mace Windu, who went with Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin, and [[Agen Kolar]] to arrest Palpatine, leaving Skywalker behind. During the ensuing [[Duel in Palpatine's office|duel]], Sidious killed three of the four Jedi with ease but was disarmed by Windu just before Skywalker arrived in his office. Skywalker pleaded with Windu not to kill Sidious, saying that he should be left for the Senate to judge, but Windu felt that Sidious was too dangerous to be left alive, as he essentially controlled the Senate. Ignoring Skywalker's words, Windu prepared to execute the Sith Lord, but Skywalker cut off his right hand, causing Windu to drop [[Mace Windu's lightsaber|his lightsaber]] and allowing Sidious to send him plummeting out of a shattered window with a blast of Force lightning,<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> all of which was sensed by Tano.<ref name=\"Shattered\">{{TCW|Shattered}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Knightfall2.png|thumb|right|296px|Darth Vader leading the 501st Legion to slaughter the Jedi in the Temple]]\nThough horrified by what he had done, Skywalker saw this as the final straw against the Jedi Order, and as such there was no turning back for him. He reluctantly pledged himself to service under his new [[Sith Master]], Darth Sidious, who named him \"Darth Vader,\"<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> a title that he did not bestow lightly.<ref name=\"DV6\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 6|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 6]]</ref> Sidious then declared all Jedi enemies of the Republic and ordered Vader to kill the Jedi at the Temple, while he executed [[Order 66]], during which clone troopers turned on their Jedi Generals and executed them on the spot. Leading the [[Siege of the Jedi Temple|attack]], Vader and the 501st Legion carried out this order. During the assault, Vader entered the council chamber and found a group of younglings trying to hide. Thinking Vader was still a Jedi Knight, [[Unidentified Jedi youngling|one boy]] asked him what they should do, but the new Sith Lord slaughtered the boy and the other younglings.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Also during the battle, Vader killed Jedi Masters such as [[Cin Drallig]],<ref name=\"swe-Cin Drallig\">{{SWE|characters|cin-drallig|Cin Drallig}}</ref> before meeting with Sidious, who then sent him to Mustafar.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nFollowing the attack, he went back home to Amidala and told her the Jedi Order had tried to topple the Republic, much to her disbelief, and that he was about to go to the [[Mustafar system]], where the [[Executive Separatist Council]] was. Telling her that he would end the war, they kissed and he left aboard his [[Darth Vader's green Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|green Eta-2 ''Actis''-class light interceptor]], which replaced the interceptor he had lost in the Battle of Coruscant.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Mission-to-Mustafar.png|thumb|left|250px|Vader confronted the Separatist Council on Mustafar where, one by one, he killed them all.]]\nOn Mustafar, Vader slaughtered the entire Separatist Council, including Wat Tambor, Poggle the Lesser, and Nute Gunray, along with their aides, his eyes now yellow and red with rage. Simultaneously, Sidious carried out the [[proclamation of the New Order]] in an emergency session of the Senate, claiming that the Jedi Order had committed treason against the Republic, and reorganized the Republic into the first [[Galactic Empire]] with himself as its [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]].<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> During this time, Vader was followed by [[Kakan]], who believed he was a jedi. Vader showed his face, eyes to Kakan and chased after him to ensure there would be no witness. During his chase, Vader ran into a cloud of [[Lava fume]]s. The fumes caused Vader to see hallucinations his fellow Jedi such as Windu, Jinn, Koon, Billaba, Yoda, and his former apprentice Tano. Vader was able to push the fumes away from himself and dismissed the hallucinations.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader's Castle\">''[[Star Wars Adventures: Shadow of Vader's Castle]]''</ref> Soon, Vader reported his mission's completion to Sidious; on his orders, Vader sent a shutdown signal to the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems Navy|Confederate navy]] and army, effectively ending the Clone Wars. With his mission completed, and the Separatists dead, Vader looked on from a balcony and shed a tear at the man he had become, but knew it was too late to turn back.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n===Becoming Darth Vader===\n====Duel on Mustafar====\n{{Quote|You were the Chosen One!

She told Vader that Obi-Wan had discovered their secret and had also told her that Vader had joined the dark side, hoping that he'd prove Obi-Wan wrong. However, Vader only confirmed it to be true. Driven power-hungry by the Dark Side, Vader tried to convince her that they could be happy together in the new Empire, stating that, given time, he could overthrow Sidious and they could rule the galaxy together. Horrified by what her husband had now become, Amidala begged him to stop and leave everything behind \"while they still can,\" but at that moment, Vader saw Obi-Wan walking out of Amidala's ship, due to him secretly stowing away in Amidala's ship. Convinced that this meant that his wife had betrayed him for his old master, and that she brought Kenobi there to kill him, Vader Force-choked Amidala until Kenobi demanded he let her go, by which point she had already fallen unconscious. Although Kenobi tried to reason with his former pupil, Vader refused to listen, as the new Empire was everything he wanted the galaxy to be.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nUnable to come to an understanding, and both believing themselves to be in the right, the two former friends then engaged in a fierce [[Duel on Mustafar|duel]], which ripped across the [[Klegger Corp Mining Facility|Separatist facility]], eventually causing it to deactivate and fall into the lava river below. The duel ended on the banks of the river, where Kenobi claimed the high ground and warned Vader not to attack. Blinded by rage and arrogance, Vader leaped to continue the duel, only to have his remaining limbs severed by his former master's blade, leaving only his cybernetic arm. Crippled, Vader slid down to the riverbank while screaming his undying hatred for his former master. Kenobi, taking Skywalker's lightsaber, told him he had considered him his brother and remorsefully left him for dead as a flap of Vader's clothing caught fire and he started burning. Kenobi then left the planet with Amidala, C-3PO, and R2-D2 as Vader lay screaming and burning on the riverbank.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Rebirth====\n{{Quote|Lord Vader, can you hear me?''\"<br />\"''Yes, Master.

Shortly afterward, the Emperor (having sensed his apprentice's peril) arrived on Mustafar, where he found the severely wounded Vader and took him back to Coruscant, in a [[medical capsule]]. As the Emperor could not afford to lose Vader, he turned to the Republic's best scientists, among which was [[Cylo]]<ref name=\"DV20\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 20|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 20]]</ref> (who in doing so, gained private access to Vader's cybernetics),<ref name=\"DV23\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 23|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 23]]</ref> and by the Emperor's orders, Vader was put into a life-sustaining black [[Vader's armor|suit of armor]] and outfitted with three new robotic limbs by numerous droids skilled in both cybernetic reconstruction and medical surgery. After two days of nonstop labor, he was finally sealed within his new armor. His eyes showed a brief flicker of fear before his mask and helmet locked together and he drew his first breath. Vader's rebirth was complete.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal Recon\">{{SW|url=video/rebels-recon-inside-the-siege-of-lothal|text=Rebels Recon: Inside \"The Siege of Lothal\"}} states that Luke and Leia were born two days after the proclamation of the New Order. Vader's transformation is concurrent to it, so it can be deduced that it, too, occurred two days after it.</ref> Upon regaining consciousness, Vader asked the Emperor what had become of his wife, and he told Vader that he had killed her in his anger. Unbeknownst to either of the two Sith, Amidala gave birth to the twins [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia]] before her death. Overwhelmed by his despair in the belief he had killed Amidala and their unborn child, which fulfilled his prophetic dreams of her death, Vader incidentally destroyed the medical droids and severely damaged the entire room through the Force. He broke free of his bindings on the operating table and struggled to walk under the sheer weight of his new prostheses and armor.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> He then let out a cry of despair over the love of his life that he believed that he killed.\n\n[[File:Vader_Sidious.png|thumb|right|266px|Amidala's death drove Skywalker further into the persona of Vader, who became Sidious' right hand in the Galactic Empire.]]\nVader's despair then turned to rage and he telekinetically slammed the Emperor against a wall in the surgical bay, snarling that his master had promised to save Amidala. The Emperor, as Vader attempted unsuccessfully to strangle him with the Force, responded that in death Amidala had provided Vader a gift: Pain. The Emperor continued by giving Vader a choice; to either accept and use that gift or to die. After a moment, Vader replied that he would live. The Emperor then immediately launched a barrage of Force lightning at his apprentice, and rhetorically demanded that Vader use the power of his lightsaber to defend himself. But Vader replied that his lightsaber had been taken by Kenobi at the conclusion of their duel. As he continued his barrage, the Emperor angrily shouted that the weapon Vader spoke of was not his. Rather, it had belonged to a Jedi, and Vader was now a Sith. Ceasing his Force-based assault, the Emperor drew his own lightsaber. He put the blade to Vader's throat and stated that he understood how traumatic the last few days had been for his apprentice, but warned that should Vader ever use the Force against him again, he would finish what Kenobi could not. The Emperor then deactivated his weapon and stated that, as friends, he hoped that the two of them would never find themselves in a similar situation. He instructed Vader to put aside his rage and lust for revenge against the Jedi for the time being, for the two of them had a great deal of work to accomplish.<ref name=\"The Chosen One 1\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 1]]</ref>\n\n====Hunting a kyber crystal====\nImmediately after his surgery, the Emperor took Vader to a balcony overlooking the old Jedi Temple. There, he and Vader watched as Mas Amedda directed a [[Celebration of the eradication of the Jedi Order|ceremonial]] burning of the lightsabers of all the Jedi who had been killed in the Temple. As they listened to Amedda's speech, the Emperor asked if his apprentice knew how or why Sith lightsaber blades were red in color. Vader replied that he did not, as the Temple's information on the subject had been \"incomplete.\" The Emperor laughed and contemptuously mused that the Jedi had been uncomfortable with the information and had buried it as a result. He then explained that kyber crystals felt pain just like any living being, and could be made to [[Bleeding|''bleed'']] after a fashion by pouring rage, pain, and hate into them. He asked Vader if he understood, to which Vader replied that he did, stating that he could have given him any of the burning Jedi lightsabers to corrupt, even Yoda's. But he had not, as Vader realized that the crystal of a Sith's lightsaber should be taken directly from a Jedi by that Sith.<ref name=\"The Chosen One 1\" />\n\nAs the ceremony progressed, the Clone Troopers attending the vent threw a basket full of various lightsabers into the incinerator, including Yoda's. The lightsabers caught on fire and a moment later, a powerful blast of energy was released into the air as the kyber crystals were destroyed.<ref name=\"The Chosen One 1\" />\n\n[[File:DV_1_Sidious_leaves_Vader.png|thumb|left|243px|Vader is dropped off on a desert world.]]\nAfterward, the Emperor brought Vader to a [[Unidentified desert astronomical object|desert astronomical object]] in the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] and assigned him the task of hunting down a Jedi to take a kyber crystal from. The Emperor took his apprentice to a site where he had arranged for a starship to be delivered for Vader's use, but the ship had been stolen by a group of pirates. Leaving Vader to reclaim the vessel, the Emperor departed, and Vader struck out for the planet's nearest settlement on foot. Once there, he [[Recapture of Vader's starship|eliminated]] the group of pirates who had stolen the ship<ref name=\"The Chosen One 1\" /> and traveled to a [[Brighthome|Jedi outpost]]. The station was garrisoned by a group of clone troopers, who noted Vader's approach and hailed him. Though he could have provided the security codes necessary to secure the clone troopers assistance, Vader decided instead to simply kill them. After exterminating the garrison, Vader tasked the droid co-pilot of his ship to search through the station's archives for data on any Jedi who had taken the [[Barash vow]] prior to Order 66. Vader's hope was that any Jedi who had taken the vow, one of complete non-interference in all Jedi affairs, would have been not only out of harm's way when Order 66 was issued but would have ignored its occurrence in accordance with the vow. The search identified Jedi Master [[Kirak Infil'a]], a Jedi who had been completely dedicated to combat to the exclusion of all else. When a grenade was thrown at him by two surviving clones, he managed to [[Force Stasis|contain]] the explosion, which the clones believed would make him unable to do anything else as all his concentration was diverted on freezing the explosion. As they talked of how they would restrain and bring in what they believed was just another Jedi survivor before the Emperor in the hopes of being rewarded, Vader proved their beliefs that he was too preoccupied with the explosive to be false by telekinetically throttling the clones and breaking their necks, before walking far enough away from the explosion to release it.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 2\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 2|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 2]]</ref>\n\nVader quickly located the Jedi on the [[Al'doleem|river moon of Al'doleem]] and sensed as he disembarked his ship that Infil'a was waiting for him. The Jedi Master immediately [[Mission to Al'doleem|confronted]] Vader, and was seized in a Force choke by the Dark Lord. However, Infil'a quickly released a Force blast at Vader which staggered him and disrupted his concentration. Infil'a declared his Barash to be complete and began to ascend the mountain upon which he lived, calling out to Vader to follow if he could. One of the Jedi Master's training droids, Arex, then opened a sluice gate which sent a river of water crashing down upon Vader. The Sith Lord was visibly battered by the rush of water, but managed to telekinetically part the river and walked to the shore. He was then set upon by a group of [[Raptoran|gigantic carnivorous birds]], which damaged one of his cybernetic legs. Vader eventually crushed them all with the Force and made his way to the peak of the mountain. There he found Infil'a and Arex awaiting him. Vader quickly unleashed a Force push that blasted Infil'a off his feet and dazed him long enough for Vader, who was unarmed, to destroy Arex and take the droid's training lightsaber. He threw the droid off the mountain and engaged Infil'a, who sensed that Vader not only wanted to kill him but wished to take his lightsaber as well. However, Vader's previously damaged leg broke apart at the knee a short time into the duel, rendering him unable to continue the fight. Infil'a then declared his intention to seek out Sidious and kill him, and blasted Vader off the top of the mountain with the Force.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 3\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 3|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Kirak_Vader_duel_city_dam.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Vader fights Infil'a on the Am'balaar city dam]]\nRegaining consciousness, Vader used the Force to reassemble his cybernetic limbs with the dismembered pieces of [[Arex]], who coincidentally had landed near where Vader had fallen. He then tracked Infil'a to [[Am'balaar City]], where he reengaged the astonished Jedi Master. Fighting atop the [[Am'balaar city dam]], the two crossed blades until the duel was interrupted by a trio of security guards. Annoyed, Vader telekinetically flung the guards from the top of the dam, but Infil'a caught them and used the Force to lower them to safety. Infil'a then shouted at Vader not to involve anyone else in their duel, but Vader instead took advantage of Infil'a's concern for innocents by ripping apart a building-sized water storage tank situated in the city below. As Infil'a attempted without success to use his own powers to stop the destruction, Vader telekinetically removed [[Kirak Infil'a's lightsaber|the Jedi's lightsaber]] from his belt and claimed it for his own. He then grabbed Infil'a in a Force choke and lifted him from the dam. Infil'a pleaded with Vader to spare the civilians below the dam, but Vader ignored him. As the enormous tank burst completely, flooding Am'balaar City, Vader crushed Infil'a's throat with the Force and tossed his body into the wreckage below.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 4\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 4|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 4]]</ref>\n\nAfter obtaining a Jedi lightsaber and the kyber crystal within, Vader reboarded his ship, whereupon the droid co-pilot seized control of the vessel and jumped to hyperspace. The droid then began to play a pre-recorded message from the Emperor to Vader. The message stated that, per the Emperor's instructions, the droid had plotted a course to the planet Mustafar, where Vader would find a dark-side [[Sith cave|locus]] which he could use to help him corrupt the kyber crystal. As the message concluded, Vader touched down on Mustafar and quickly found the locus the Emperor had spoken of, an ancient Sith shrine within a shallow cavern. There, he disassembled Infil'a's lightsaber on a small, flat rock formation and removed the kyber crystal. However, when he attempted to corrupt it, the crystal resisted and used the Force to send Vader careening into one of the cavern walls. The crystal then caused Vader to experience a vision wherein he rejected the dark side, journeyed to Coruscant, and killed Palpatine. In the vision, Vader then found Obi-Wan and begged for his forgiveness. As he knelt in contrition in front of his former master, Obi-Wan called out to Vader by his former name, Anakin. Upon hearing this, Vader snapped out of his vision and angrily rejected the possibility shown to him by the crystal, declaring \"this is all there is.\" He then began to pour his hatred, pain, and rage into the crystal. As the planet around the cave was consumed in a violent storm, Vader succeeded in corrupting the crystal.\n\nAfterwards, Vader returned to Coruscant and stormed into the Emperor's office during the middle of a discussion between Tarkin, Mas Amedda, and the Emperor regarding the construction of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. As Vader was completely unknown to anyone other than Palpatine at the time, the Royal Guards in the Emperor's office attempted to intercept him, only to be blasted back into the office's large window. Seeing Vader, the Emperor dismissed both Tarkin and Amedda, the former of whom expressed concern for his safety. Reassuring Tarkin, the Emperor repeated his command, and the two Imperial officials departed, leaving Vader to triumphantly display Kirak Infil'a's lightsaber, now emitting a [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|crimson blade]], to the Emperor.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 5\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 5|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 5]]</ref>\n\n====Training the Inquisitorius====\n{{Quote|The Inquisitors are formidable fighters.

Leaving Vader to repair his armor and limbs, the Emperor informed Vader that he had a new mission for him to undertake once his convalescence was complete. A short time later, Vader was informed of an [[The Grand Inquisitor|intruder]] in the Jedi Temple Archives. He promptly confronted the intruder, who wielded a [[The Grand Inquisitor's lightsaber|red lightsaber]]. As the two fought each other, the intruder appeared to take the advantage, but after a time Vader revealed that he had simply been testing the modifications that he had recently made to his armor, and promptly destroyed the intruder's lightsaber. As Vader went in for the kill, the Emperor arrived and told him that the intruder, titled the Grand Inquisitor, was part of the [[Inquisitorius]]. Vader was then taken to [[The Works]], where Vader saw the rest of the Inquisitorius training themselves. Vader was told that most of the Inquisitorius were Jedi who converted to the dark side in the wake of the Order's destruction in order to save themselves. Vader and the Inquisitorius were then given the mission to finish the remaining surviving Jedi of the Emperor's [[Great Jedi Purge|Purge]].<ref name=\"Darth Vader 6\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 6|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 6]]</ref>\n\nVader dueled the [[Sixth Brother]] in a training session and cut off his arm in order to teach him about loss. Vader then spoke with the Grand Inquisitor about improving the Inquisitorius' training methods. They began to search for other Jedi that survived the purge. Vader saw the Inquisitors' target list and noticed the Jedi Archive's [[Chief Librarian]], [[Jocasta Nu]], on it. He asked the Emperor what was so important about her. The Emperor explained that she had knowledge of the Sith that she and the Jedi council had kept secret. The Emperor told Vader to find Nu and bring her to him. Vader assigned the Grand Inquisitor to search the Archive for information on her.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 7\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 7]]</ref>\n\n====Hunt for Jocasta Nu====\nAt that time, Nu had returned to Coruscant and sneaked into the former Jedi temple to search for a list of young Force-sensitives in her secret archives.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 7\" /> As she roamed the ruins, her droid, [[Beetoo]], informed her that [[Jocasta Nu's Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor|her ship]] was about to be discovered. She informed the droid that she would adjust her plans accordingly. As [[Coruscant Security Force]]s came into the hanger, Beetoo detonated Nu's ship and killed the three security officers. As Nu made for a secret archive vault, she noticed the Grand Inquisitor reading through the Jedi knowledge. She continued, only focusing on the mission at hand.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 8\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 8|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 8]]</ref>\n\n[[File:DV-Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith-DL_II_Unknown_Major.jpg|thumb|right|211px|Vader and the Imperial Security Bureau major]]\nVader was contacted by an [[Unidentified Imperial Security Bureau major|Imperial Security Bureau major]], who had discovered a Jedi insignia on the wreckage of Nu's ship, and he went to the [[Imperial Security Bureau headquarters]] to check it out. When Vader arrived, the major asked what rank he should address him by, and Vader said, \"lord.\" The major explained to Vader their suspicions that the explosion was premature and the Jedi insignia was merely \"rabble-rousing graffiti\" used as a calling card. Vader told him he was wrong, and as the major explained his experience in intelligence, Vader used the Force to reconstruct Nu's ship, showing the major that he was indeed wrong about the cause of the explosion. Vader then ordered him to search every level of Coruscant, steering clear of the Jedi temple.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 8\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Nu was about to vacate the temple when she noticed the Grand Inquisitor insulting the Jedi knowledge he was examining. His comments eventually drove her over the edge and she confronted him with her lightsaber.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 8\" /> Vader arrived at the temple entrance and [[Commander]] [[CC-1010|Fox]] already had sealed the place. When Fox asked him what they were expecting to happen and Vader told him that they had missed a Jedi during Order 66. As Vader entered the temple, Nu was pinning down the Grand Inquisitor with her lightsaber and threatening him. The Grand Inquisitor asked how she did not remember who he was, stating the times she had denied him the Jedi knowledge he sought. Nu attacked him, kicking off a short duel where the Grand Inquisitor quickly outwitted her. The Grand Inquisitor would have killed Nu if not for Vader's arrival. As Vader stopped the Grand Inquisitor from slaying the Jedi, Nu used the Force to rain Jedi books on them, and she fled the scene.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 9\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 9|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 9]]</ref>\n\nVader made chase and as he followed Nu's trail, she made it to the archive vault and used a terminal to purge the entire library of its knowledge. As Vader entered the vault, he was confronted by the droid guard, [[Cator]]. He identified Vader as Anakin Skywalker and told him he was not authorized to be there. Vader threw his lightsaber at the droid, but being a guard against possible Force-sensitive threats meant the droid was ready for that move, and it caught Vader's weapon. Vader then punched Cator's arm off, and the droid caught his wrist and squeezed it with its robotic hand. Vader drove his fist through Cator's face before the droid could damage him any more. But as Cator dropped to the floor, Vader noticed a powerful shot being fired at him and used his lightsaber to deflect it. The shot, fired by Nu using a [[lightsaber rifle]], knocked Vader back as it ripped through a bookcase. Nu stood at the entrance of the vault, confronting Vader.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 9\" />\n\nAs Vader got up again, he tried to convince Nu to drop her weapon. Nu ignored him and fired again. Vader dodged her shot and she fired a third time, further devastating the vault. As she continued firing, she tried to convince Vader that he was just a tool to the Emperor, saying that he could never get rid of the light side of the Force as it always found its vessels. Nu's rifle then failed to keep firing, and Vader deactivated his lightsaber, telling her she would not be harmed. Nu's rifle then began beeping and she threw it towards Vader. He used the Force to push it away, and it exploded, throwing both of them to the floor and breaching the side of the temple.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 10\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 10]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Vader_hunts_for_Jocasta_Nu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vader and the clones corner Jocasta Nu.]]\nNu fled through the fresh hole in the wall to find newly alerted clone troopers around the perimeter. They fired at her and she jumped down, deflecting their shots back at them. As the clones put more pressure on her, she Force-pushed them over the ledge behind them. Vader then appeared through the wall and the clones assumed he was too a Jedi and fired on him. At that moment, Commander Fox approach the scene on an [[Imperial Patrol Ship]] and realized that they were firing on Vader. He then had his ship fly over to Vader and ordered his units to a ceasefire. Vader jumped onto the ship and when Fox tried to explain the misunderstanding, he used the Force to break his neck.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 10\" />\n\nThe clones on the ground continued firing on Nu and managed to disarm her. She then found herself cornered by Vader and the clones, and she attempted to jump off, only for Vader to use the Force to catch her. He brought her to his ship, and there she told the clones that he was the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. Vader used the Force to throw the clones off the ship and when Nu asked of what became of her, he killed her. Vader then crashed the ship and contacted Sidious, telling him that Nu died in an attempt to escape. With Nu having revealed Sidious would create more dark side agents with the list and questioning what it was that Vader truly wanted before her death, Vader then crushed the list of Force-sensitive children that she had with her.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 10\" />\n\n====Defiance from the Imperial hierarchy====\nBelieving that he lost all that he cared about by his own hand, Darth Vader embraced his role as the Emperor's chief enforcer. Few knew who he was, and even fewer suspected that he had once been Anakin Skywalker. His appearance at the Imperial court and the favor he carried from the Emperor earned him the distrust of [[Imperial officer]]s. They resented him for appearing out of nowhere and having authority over them because of his link to his Master. They also resented his heavy-handed treatment of them, such as when he used the Force in the presence of his Master to choke Colonel [[Barokki]].<ref name=\"Dark Lord 12\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 12]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Darth_Vader_Dark_Lord_11_Cabarria.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vader and the Ninth Sister investigate a Jedi sighting on Cabarria.]]\nThe situation eventually came to a head when Vader investigated a Jedi sighting on [[Cabarria]]. Accompanied by the [[Ninth Sister]], he headed to the [[Unidentified bar (Cabarria)|bar]] where the identification had happened. Although the Ninth Sister had originally been planning to investigate alone, Vader had come, claiming she was not yet ready to face a Jedi in combat but secretly because he wanted to fight another Jedi. The Ninth Sister commented on his true desire, using her empathic abilities to read him clearly. As a result, Vader ordered her to remain outside while he investigated. Once inside, the Dark Lord was attacked by a [[Cha family|family]] of bounty hunters named [[Bhada Cha|Bhada]], [[Ramat Cha|Ramat]] and [[Chanath Cha]]. Using [[ion grenade]]s, they neutralized all the weapons in the bar while Chanath tried to seize Vader's lightsaber with a [[tractor rifle]]. However, he used the Force to seize the lightsaber midair and, under the strain of the two opposing forces, the hilt shattered, leaving only the red kyber crystal.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 11\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 11]]</ref>\n\nThe Chas told the assembled customers that they had come only for the \"Jedi\" and that they weren't planning on harming anyone. However, a disarmed Vader disagreed and used the Force to turn the customers into projectiles aimed at the Chas. Taken by the surprise, the bounty hunters turned on their shields to protect themselves. As they attacked him, Vader also used the customers and the bar's furniture as shields. Eventually, the hunters realized they could not defeat him and made to flee. Reclaiming his crystal with the Force, Vader pursued them.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 11\" />\n\nEmerging from the bar, Vader initially suspected that the Inquisitors had been behind the attempt on his life and threatened the Ninth Sister with her own lightsaber. The Inquisitor's denials did not sway the Dark Lord, but neither did they prove her guilt. Determined to find who had placed a bounty on his head, he pursued the Chas. They eluded him for a time until he crashed a massive vehicle into their path, causing their speeder to crash. Seizing Chanath in a Force choke, he requested they tell him who had ordered his death. They told him about an anonymous bounty with an exorbitant price posted on the hunter net. Ramat Cha, a talented [[slicer]], offered to uncover their employer for him in exchange for their daughter's life. When they demanded that he release Chanath first, Vader refused and threatened to kill them all. However, the Chas countered that, even in death, they would be together so he could not threaten them with such tactics. Grudgingly impressed, the Dark Lord demanded proof that Ramat could deliver her side of the deal, which she proved by tracking the signal of the bounty back to Coruscant. Vader released Chanath as agreed, at which point the bounty hunters made their daughter swear that she would seek no vengeance against the Dark Lord, a deal Vader chose to honor. To complete the deal, Ramat provided Vader with the information he had requested and gave him the source of the bounty on him: the [[Imperial Executive Building]] on Coruscant, specifically the Emperor's office.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 11\" />\n\nWith their business on Cabarria completed, Vader and the Ninth Sister left the planet and returned to Coruscant. Now suspecting that the Emperor had placed the bounty on his head, the Dark Lord planned to confront his Master about his intentions. As the Ninth Sister piloted the ship through hyperspace, Vader worked on creating a new lightsaber. His [[Darth Vader's droid|droid]] meanwhile investigated the origins of the kill contract placed on him and confirmed that the order could have come from the Emperor's office, with no evidence of slicing to indicate foul play. But, as the ship arrived in orbit over Coruscant, the ship's attempt to transmit clearance codes for landing was jammed and the ship itself was marked as being part of a [[Separatist holdouts|Separatist splinter cell]]. The Imperial capital's orbital defenses targeted Vader's ship. Only the Dark Lord's skill as a pilot prevented them from being destroyed, although the ship was damaged and forced to crash land on Coruscant. Tired of the repeated [[Assassination attempts on Darth Vader|attempts]] on his life, the Dark Lord headed to the former Jedi Temple to confront the Emperor.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 12\" />\n\nThe Emperor was investigating the hoard of artifacts that Jocasta Nu had collected and stored in the Jedi Archives when Vader arrived. The Emperor sensed that his apprentice did not wish to discuss his recent discovery, although he did praise him for having found the Librarian's stash. Vader informed his master of the events on Cabarria and his investigation into the kill order against him, before directly asking his Master whether he had placed it on his head as part of a test. Noticing Vader's new lightsaber, the Emperor asked to see it, approving of its design. He also chastised his apprentice for believing that he would resort to such methods as placing a bounty on his head if he wanted to have him killed and that he did not \"test\": he \"taught.\" He also told Vader that finding the assassins was his task, not theirs. This echoed a previous lesson he had taught Vader when he had \"disciplined\" Colonel Barokki: that they must not kill everyone in the galaxy, but that having power meant they could, and that they would never lack for people to destroy.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 12\" />\n\n[[File:Rule_of_Five_2_Auditorium.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious and Vader at a gathering of the officers of the Imperial Officers corps]]\nVader returned to his quarters, where he meditated on the past events and his Master's words. Thinking back to all that had happened, he eventually realized the cause of the conspiracy against him was that his sudden elevation had caused concern and fear among the ranks of the Imperial officers, who knew that he had \"strength,\" but not that he shared the Emperor's \"power.\" Despite a lack of proof, Vader became convinced that Colonel Barokki, who had so suddenly borne his displeasure, must be involved in the conspiracy. The Dark Lord met with the Emperor and shared his conclusions, and requested that he be publicly recognized and allowed to show them the consequences of opposing him. The Emperor asked whether he was sure, and Vader confirmed it: he would not kill them all unless he had to but would not allow them to act against him with impunity. The Emperor agreed to Vader's plan, but forbade him from killing Tarkin, as he was essential to his plans.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 12\" />\n\nThe Emperor gathered the [[Imperial Officer Corps|elite officers]] of the growing Imperial military to clarify the new hierarchy. He formally introduced Vader as his emissary, who spoke with his voice and whose commands would need to be obeyed as if they had come from the Emperor himself. The Emperor then moved aside and allowed Vader to speak: the Dark Lord summoned five officers before him: [[Corin Ferro]], [[Zorta Bingan]], [[Joon Strephi]], [[Tomas Azoras]], and Barokki. Informing them that the two attempts on his life had been made from within the Officer Corps and that he had his suspicions who had been responsible, he instituted a new rule: for every assassination attempt he survived (and he warned them that he would ''always'' survive), five officers chosen at random would be executed. He instantly executed the five designated officers with a Force choke before departing, leaving the remaining officers stunned and afraid.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 12\" />\n\n====War on Mon Cala====\n[[File:Darth_Vader_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith_13_Textless.jpg|thumb|right|231px|Vader awakes from his meditation]]\nOne year into the reign of the Empire, Vader was reliving his duel on Mustafar through meditation. During his experience, he was already in his cybernetic suit, and he used the Force to throw lava at Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan jumped up to dodge it, but Vader Force-choked him and threw him into the rocks. Vader watched Obi-Wan burn before he awoke in his meditation chamber as the Emperor asked for him over the comm. In his throne room, the Emperor told Vader that a year after his ascension, it was time to show that his voice was the only voice within the Empire. Vader asked how, and the Emperor told him that Mon Cala would make a great example of the price of defiance. He further told Vader that [[Mon Cala monarchy|King]] Lee-Char may have had an adviser helping him with his negotiations with the Empire. Vader asked if it could be a Jedi, and the Emperor said it was possible. He told Vader to take a team to investigate this and claimed the military aspects of the operation would be left to Moff Tarkin.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 13\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 13]]</ref>\n\nVader arrived at Mon Cala aboard the [[Zeta-class shuttle|''Zeta''-class shuttle]] ''[[Infernum]]''. With him, he took three Inquisitors, the Sixth Brother, Ninth Sister and [[Tenth Brother]], and a death squad of [[Purge Trooper]]s. At this time, the Imperial ambassador [[Telvar]] had just finished another meeting with Lee-Char, and the man was walking to his shuttle when he saw Vader descend from the ramp of his shuttle. The Ninth Sister struggled to get past the king's [[Chief of Security]], Gial Ackbar, and Vader confronted the Mon Calamari, asking if he had read the writ that the Ninth Sister had given him. Ackbar confirmed that he had, but demanded that he knew their business as he had a job to do and so did Vader. Vader complied and explained about a possible enemy of the Empire on Mon Cala. As he said that, Telvar's shuttle took off and flew for Tarkin's Star Destroyer, the ''[[Sovereign]]''&mdash;which was in orbit above Mon Cala. However, as Ackbar denied the possibility of an enemy of the Empire being on Mon Cala, Telvar's shuttle exploded.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 13\" />\n\n[[File:Dark_Lord_14_Battle_of_Dac_City_2.jpg|thumb|left|264px|Vader and his Inquisitors seize the landing pad.]]\nTelvar's assassination prompted Tarkin to enact a full-scale [[invasion of Mon Cala]]. His forces landed at [[Dac City]], where Vader had arrived, and [[Battle of Dac City|laid siege]] to the Mon Calamari and Quarren defenses. Vader and his team sprang to life and soon seized the landing pad where the ''Infernum'' was parked. He then led them to the [[Dac City palace]] to find Lee-Char and ask him about the possible Jedi. They fought their way through the palace guards and entered the palace, where the Ninth Sister began torturing Lee-Char for the location of the Jedi. However, another threat loomed over them. A massive tidal wave had suddenly erupted as a part of Lee-Char's defensive plan. The Sixth Brother warned them of this, and he and the Tenth Brother began shielding Vader and the Ninth Sister from the wave using the Force. When their attempts began failing, Vader joined them, but it wasn't enough. The group was washed away by the wave, and Dac City was left in ruins.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 14\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 14]]</ref>\n\nVader awoke at the bottom of the [[Great Ungeness Trench]]. As his oxygen supply was dwindling, he used the Force to create an air bubble for himself. Suddenly, he was attacked by a [[Unidentified squid-like creature|squid-like creature]], and after wrestling with it, he killed it with the Force. Vader then rode its body using the Force and eventually picked up a transmission from the Inquisitors. Vader asked them to come to his position, and they did so in an [[Imperial submarine]]. When they picked him up, he asked about the Jedi, and the Inquisitors said that he was still alive somewhere. Vader then asked about Lee-Char, and the Ninth Sister said that they didn't know, but she then revealed that she had gotten the Jedi's location from him. Knowing exactly where their target was, they began traveling for the Jedi.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 15\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 15|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 15]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Order_66_Recording.png|thumb|right|250px|Ferren Barr discovered that Darth Vader was once Anakin Skywalker, the prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order.]]\nVader and his team arrived at the Jedi's location to find the individual and his disciples evacuating. The Jedi, an [[Iktotchi]] Padawan called [[Ferren Barr]], had been notified by Lee-Char after he was recovered following the events at Dac City. The group of them immediately scattered, but [[Nipaltoo|one of the disciples]] instead attacked the submarine head-on with his blaster. The shots bounced off the window, and Vader used the Force to crush his helmet. The other fled in the direction of [[Bel City]], and as Vader caught up with them, [[Orvek|another disciple]] turned around to attack them. He too died in the process but managed to slow Vader's submarine, and the rest of the group followed Barr to Bel City. Vader and the Inquisitors arrived at Bel City and marched down the hallway, reinforced by the Inquisitors and the Purge troopers. Vader was then contacted by Tarkin, who was struggling to deal with the grueling conflict on Mon Cala. Vader told Tarkin that he was busy, but Tarkin knew that and asked him to do something else instead: capture Lee-Char. Vader told Tarkin that he did not answer to him, but Tarkin replied that capturing Lee-Char was the only way to end the fighting quickly on Mon Cala, and he pledged to owe Vader a favor if he did so. Vader agreed and told the Inquisitors to continue the hunt as he left.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 16\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 16|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 16]]</ref>\n\nVader arrived at Lee-Char's [[Royal Command Bunker]] and killed his guards. He then disarmed Lee-Char and contacted Tarkin, who told him to take Lee-Char to a window and send him his exact location. Vader asked Tarkin if he was going to send a shuttle, and the man said not yet. Once Vader did what he asked, Tarkin began a bombardment of Mon Cala. Lee-Char watched in horror but refused to surrender. The two were interrupted by Barr, who had outsmarted and scattered Vader's team. Barr confronted Vader and the two [[Duel in the Royal Command Bunker|dueled]]. As they fought, Barr revealed that he had assassinated Telvar to send the Mon Calamari into war. Lee-Char overheard this and realized his mistake in following Barr. He ran to his terminal and sent a message to the Mon Calamari and Quarren forces, ordering them to cease fire. Lee-Char then contacted Tarkin, notifying him of the surrender. Tarkin sent a shuttle to pick him up but continued the bombardment.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 17\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 17|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 17]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Barr_vs_Vader_DV17.png|thumb|left|240px|Vader duels the Jedi Ferren Barr.]]\nVader and Barr continued fighting, and Barr began laughing. Lee-Char questioned this, and Barr said that he had completed his plan. Barr prophesied that the Mon Calamari vessels would be at the forefront of a great rebellion decades from then, and decades after that. Vader told Barr that he wasn't a Jedi anymore, and Barr told him that that made two of them, saying that he still beat the Sith. Vader then slew him, and the shuttle arrived to pick up Lee-Char. The king told Vader that Mon Cala would rise again, but Vader told him that there was no Mon Cala, only the Empire.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 17\" /> Some time after the mission, Vader ordered to imprison and tortue the people of Mon Cala.<ref name=\"Allegiance 2\">''[[Allegiance 2]]''</ref>\n\n===Accepting the dark side===\n====The Emperor's emissary====\n[[File:SWAD13-The-Empires-Finest.png|250px|right|thumb|For two decades, Vader was the loyal enforcer of Emperor Sheev Palpatine, commanding the might of the Imperial Army as well.]]\nOver the next two decades of the Empire's reign, Vader would remain one of the few who enjoyed direct access to Palpatine and his preferred envoy for all matters that the Emperor took a direct interest in. Such matters included the elimination of rebel uprisings and the continued construction of the [[Death Star]]. One of Vader's earliest missions on the Emperor's behalf was to effect an execution on [[Murkhana]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> He was also made privy to the secret construction of the Death Star, to be overseen by Wilhuff Tarkin.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> The Imperial officers remained wary of Vader and his power, as well as his continued devotion to the ancient ways of the Force, but none rose to challenge him without feeling the consequences.<ref name=\"Rogue One: Visual Guide\" /> At some point, Vader was deployed to put down resistance on the mineral rich world of [[Bandomeer]], where miners were fighting back against Imperial exploitation. Vader punished them for their rebellion.<ref name=\"HC 4\">{{HelmetCollectionCite|4|Databank A-Z|B1 Battle Droid&ndash;Bantha}}</ref>\n\nDespite the mistrust and even hatred he generated among the officers, Vader was held in high esteem by the [[Stormtrooper Corps]], as he often fought alongside them at the front line rather than remaining in command centers. As the Emperor's enforcer, Vader retained command of the unit he had commanded during the Clone Wars as Anakin Skywalker: the 501st Legion. When the Emperor retired the clone troopers, the rank and file of the 501st were composed of recruited stormtroopers, some of whom received training from the Dark Lord himself, such as Sergeant [[Kreel]], an undercover agent whom Vader trained in lightsaber combat. Through their missions on Vader's behalf, the 501st came to be known as \"Vader's Fist.\"<ref name=\"SW12\">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref> On one occasion, the stormtrooper [[Terex]] met Vader, becoming terrified of him while also respecting him.<ref name=\"PD11\">[[Poe Dameron 11|''Poe Dameron'' 11]]</ref> Vader also garnered strong support from the pilots of the new [[Imperial Navy]].<ref name=\"LotS\">''[[Lords of the Sith]]''</ref>\n\n====Investigation on Geonosis====\nVader soon became aware of a project that was taking up many resources. He began investigating, which led him to the [[Scarif vault|data vault]] on [[Scarif]]. There, he found Project Stardust, a project that was a large battle station the size of a small moon. Vader studied its design before he was interrupted by Tarkin, who was very displeased with Vader's snooping. Tarkin told him he wasn't authorized to be there, and Vader claimed that the Force was all the authorization he needed. Vader denied that he was Tarkin's beast but the man denied his claim and taunted Vader, saying he didn't need the Force to know he was very angry. Tarkin then produced a hologram of the Emperor, who told Vader he did not recall sending him to Scarif. Vader apologized and told the Emperor he only sought to study the ways in which the Empire would extend its rule over the galaxy. The Emperor told Vader of a new mission he was to go on. There had been certain instances of sabotage during the Death Star's construction that Vader needed to discover the source of before it got worse. The Emperor further told Vader that Tarkin had full authority over him and that if he disappointed him, he disappointed Palpatine.<ref name=\"Vader annual 2\">[[Darth Vader Annual 2|''Darth Vader Annual'' 2]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Erso_office.jpg|thumb|left|243px|Vader visits Galen Erso's office.]]\nVader arrived at Geonosis and met with Commander [[Orson Callan Krennic]]. As they greeted, an overhead rock formation exploded and rained down on them. Vader saved himself and Krennic and they went to [[Krennic's Office|his office]] to discuss the matter. Krennic claimed it was Tarkin sabotaging his efforts in order to get rid of him and take over the project. Vader asked him if there was any proof and Krennic wasn't able to produce anything. Krennic then explained to him the incidences that had occurred in the last three months. Vader gave his knowledge on the situation to [[loyalty officer]] [[Sid Uddra]], who met him at the Petranaki Arena to discuss what she suspected. She told Vader that as much as Tarkin and Krennic's rivalry arose tension between them, it was unlikely for either to be the culprit. She then offered Vader with another individual to look into: the scientist [[Galen Walton Erso]]. Vader looked through [[Galen Erso's Office|his office]] and found many kyber crystals in which he [[Bleeding|bled]] for himself without issue. He then found a recording of Erso and [[Erso family|his family]]. Vader also noticed that Erso called his daughter stardust, which was the codename for the Death Star's project. Finally, Vader found an [[ootheca]] egg in a box. Knowing that Geonosians were a slave race and were forbidden from breeding freely, he confronted Krennic about this. Krennic denied that it was him and suggested that some of the slaves may have sent it as a distress call to Erso. Vader then deduced for himself the saboteurs at hand.<ref name=\"Vader annual 2\" />\n\nVader and a squad of death troopers entered a Geonosian hive and found the queen and her minions. The two sides engaged but Vader quickly came out on top, slaying the queen. After the battle, he returned to Tarkin on the ''Carrion Spike'' and reported his findings to him. Tarkin asked Vader how he knew the queen's hive had orchestrated the sabotages and Vader told how their slicers had confirmed the hive to have installed corrupted tech into production, ensuring accidents. Tarkin then asked Vader how he may have dealt with them and Vader said that they were animals and so they were slaughtered like animals. Tarkin finally asked Vader if there was anything else and he stated to Tarkin that his project, the Death Star, was able to destroy a planet. Tarkin asked how he knew and he told him of the kyber crystals he saw in Erso's office. Tarkin then asked Vader why he wasn't happy for this revelation, and Vader said that he distrusted his reliance on technological aberration. Tarkin then told Vader that he was one of those before realizing that Vader wanted to be the only technological aberration. Vader warned Tarkin that the Death Star may become his tomb, and when Tarkin asked if that was a threat, Vader told him it was only a prediction.<ref name=\"Vader annual 2\" />\n\n====Relics of the Clone Wars====\n[[File:VaderFindsAhsokaSaber-VaD.png|thumb|right|250px|Darth Vader finds Tano's saber on the snowy moon, believing her dead.]]\nYears after the [[Skirmish aboard the Tribunal|skirmish]] aboard<ref name=\"Victory and Death guide\">{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/victory-and-death-episode-guide|text=\"Victory and Death\" Episode Guide}}</ref> the ''[[Tribunal]]'' during Order 66,<ref name=\"Join the Battle\" /> but still during the early Imperial era,<ref name=\"Victory and Death Episode Gallery 20\">{{SW|url=victory-and-death-episode-gallery|text=\"Victory and Death\" Episode Gallery}} {{C|Slide 20}}</ref> Vader traveled to the [[Unidentified moon (Ahsoka Tano)|snowy moon]] that was home to the crash site of the ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"Victory and Death\">{{TCW|Victory and Death}}</ref> Investigating the wreckage with a contingent of [[Cold weather assault stormtrooper|snowtroopers]], Vader discovered a memorial to the [[332nd Company|clone company]] that perished in the crash, as well as a lightsaber, partly frozen but still functional, that once belonged to his former apprentice, Ahsoka Tano.

The attack had been staged by several dozen members of the [[Free Ryloth Movement]], a primarily [[Twi'lek]] insurgency intent on liberating their homeworld from the rule of the Empire. The insurgents hijacked an Imperial weapons transport, and Vader led a squadron of [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter|V-wing starfighters]] in pursuit. After a long chase, during which the transport fled through hyperspace to several different systems, its engines overloaded when it attempted to make yet another jump and Vader's squadron was finally able to engage it. The squadron brought down the transport's shields with minimal casualties while Vader crippled the engines.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nThough the squadron commander suggested allowing the ''Perilous'' to tractor the transport into one of its hangar bays when it arrived, Vader assumed (correctly) that the insurgents planned to destroy the transport by detonating the heavy ordnance present in the ship's cargo bays. In order to prevent this eventuality, Vader crashed his [[Darth Vader's black Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|black Eta-2 ''Actis''-class light interceptor]] into one of its gun bubbles and ejected just before the collision. He then entered the ship through the damaged gun emplacement and proceeded to kill all of the insurgent Twi'leks on the ship. After eliminating the insurgent leader [[Pok (Twi'lek)|Pok]], Vader noticed an active comlink on the bridge. Assuming that another rebel ship was nearby, Vader had his V-wings fan out in a search pattern, but the rebel ship escaped detection by shutting down nearly all of its systems and hiding in the rings of a nearby planet. Finding nothing, Vader had the ''Perilous'' collect the transport, and returned to Coruscant.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nIn the Imperial Palace, Vader reunited with his master. There, he and Sidious met with Ryloth's [[Senator]] Orn Free Taa involving the inconvenience that was the Free Ryloth Movement. The movement, though relatively minor, had been conducting raids on Imperial shipping facilities and transports and had seriously impacted the flow of [[Spice]] from the planet. As such, Sidious believed that the situation warranted his personal attention, and decided that he, Taa, and Vader would travel to Ryloth for a [[Mission to Ryloth|state visit]]. After informing the Senator of the planned journey and dismissing him, Sidious informed his apprentice that Taa almost certainly had a traitor in the midst of his support staff who was feeding the movement classified information on Imperial doings.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nThough Vader understood his master's purpose in acting as bait alongside himself and Taa, he saw no reason why the Emperor should potentially risk his own safety over such a minor issue. Rather, Vader advocated for simply killing Taa and his entire staff, thereby guaranteeing the elimination of the traitor. However, Sidious wished to eliminate the roots of the treachery, and not simply the lone traitor in Taa's staff. To that end, Sidious gave the order for [[Moff]] [[Delian Mors]] to be informed that Taa would be arriving for a state visit, but stipulated that she should not be told that either he or Vader would be accompanying the Senator. In this way, Sidious hoped to provide further encouragement for the movement to attack, as he assumed that they would discover his and Vader's plans via their spies. Ten days later Vader, the Emperor, Taa, and a contingent of [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Royal Guards]] journeyed to the Ryloth system aboard the ''Perilous''.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\n=====Assassination attempt on the ''Defiance''=====\n{{Quote|This guy again. I don't care if you kill me.|[[Commandant]] [[Pell Baylo]] to Darth Vader|Orientation}}\nWhile traveling from Coruscant to Ryloth, the Emperor ordered the ''Perilous'' to stop in the [[Denon system]] to consult with several navy chiefs on how to better integrate disparate naval academies into one [[Imperial Naval Academy]]. The Emperor ordered Vader to oversee a training session conducted by [[Commandant]] [[Pell Baylo]] on the [[Obedience|''Defiance'']] while the Emperor met with his naval chiefs in Baylo's office on the training ship. It was during this training session that Vader began to believe that Sidious was treating him much the same way the Jedi Council had previously: acting as he knew better, keeping information from Vader, giving him \"busywork.\" Baylo ordered the ''Defiance'' to enter hyperspace on a course for Christophsis. Cadet [[Rae Sloane]] entered the coordinates, only to have her hyperspace path overridden by Baylo, who said she was going to send them too close to a singularity.<ref name=\"Orientation\">{{InsiderCite|157|Orientation}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Commandant Baylo.png|right|250px|thumb|Pell Baylo attempted to assassinate Emperor Palpatine, only for Vader to undo his plot.]]\nSloane studied the path, suspecting that Baylo was incorrect in his adjustment. Vader and Sloane discovered that the changed hyperspace route would crash the ''Defiance'' into [[Christophsis' sun]], killing all aboard. Vader ordered Sloane to correct the problem, and without revealing that he knew of Baylo's treachery, Vader and Baylo went to see the Emperor. The Emperor ordered Baylo to turn over command of the ''Defiance'' and take a position at the training center on [[Corellia]]. Baylo, however, was loyal to the Republic and considered the Empire a hostile power. Instead of turning over his command, Baylo offered his resignation from the navy. Vader then revealed he knew of Baylo's plan to crash the ''Defiance'', and the Emperor congratulated Vader for handling the \"petty problem,\" annoying him.<ref name=\"Orientation\" />\n\nAs Baylo railed against the Emperor, Vader Force-choked him to death, drawing ire from the Emperor, who had wished to see Baylo suffer and force him to watch his beloved Navy be turned into something he hated and have the ''Defiance'' be melted down into cafeteria trays. Above all, he wanted to use Baylo for his own ambitions since the old man was willing to kill his own students for a cause. Vader tried to explain that his way was more efficient, but the Emperor wanted to hear nothing of it as he did not order him to kill Baylo. Later, he ordered Sloane to have the ''Defiance'' renamed the ''Obedience'' as a subtle final jab at Baylo and a not-so-subtle reminder toward Vader to learn his place.<ref name=\"Orientation\" />\n\n=====Crash land on Ryloth=====\nShortly thereafter, Vader and the Emperor reboarded the ''Perilous'' and resumed their course to the Ryloth system. However, upon their exit from hyperspace, the ship immediately began slamming into spacial mines set up by [[Cham Syndulla]]'s rebels. Hidden amongst these mines were specialized devices designed to drain the ship's shields, which began to buckle under the continual assault. As the shields neared failure, a swarm of several hundred reprogrammed Vulture Droids set upon the ''Perilous'' from the system's asteroid belt. Vader boarded his personal interceptor and took several squadrons of Imperial pilots to destroy the droid fighters and mines, but discovered a short time into the battle that Vulture Droids were each carrying a payload of explosive [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droids]].<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nRealizing that the Vultures themselves were simply delivery systems meant to unload the buzz droids near or inside the Star Destroyer, Vader ordered his squadron to concentrate fire on them, as they presented a far greater threat than the mines. But between the mines and the Vultures, there were simply too many targets for Vader and his squadrons to handle, and the ''Perilous'' was severely damaged. The second wave of Vultures was detected immediately after the first had been destroyed, further compounding the already bleak situation. A message came to Vader from Captain Lewitt of the ''Perilous'' that the ship could sustain virtually no more damage without being destroyed.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nVader moved to intercept the second wave alone, ordering his squadrons to remain near the ''Perilous'' to destroy any droids that got past him. Though incredulous, the squadron commander obeyed, and Vader used the Force to begin tearing apart the compartments on the Vulture droids that housed the explosive buzz droids. He then used the Force to begin flinging the buzz droids at other incoming fighters and repeated this process until the vast majority of the Vulture Droids had been destroyed. The remaining fighters were annihilated by Vader's squadrons, and he himself returned to the ''Perilous''. Vader marched to the Star Destroyer's bridge and Force choked Taa for a short time, informing him of the traitor in his staff that had been responsible for the assault on the ''Perilous''. Utterly terrified, the Senator vowed to find the traitor, but the Emperor had Taa and his staff confined to their quarters. An order was then broadcast from the Imperial headquarters on Ryloth for any and all repair ships to aid the ''Perilous'' as it sped, badly damaged, towards the planet.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\n[[File:19BBY-Cham-Syndulla.png|250px|thumb|left|Twi'lek revolutionary Cham Syndulla, who tried to kill Vader and the Emperor]] \nUnbeknownst to Vader, some of the Twi'lek repair teams in fact comprised members of the Free Ryloth movement, one of which was a group of saboteurs with orders to plant timed explosives on the hyperdrive core of the ''Perilous''. Shortly after the teams landed, one of the Free Ryloth groups engaged in a firefight with Imperial stormtroopers. When Vader learned of this, he ordered all of the Twi'lek repair teams, numbering over 100, to be killed regardless of whether they were aiding the assault and proceeded to Deck 17, where the firefight had been reported. On the way, he killed a group of apparently uninvolved Twi'leks before proceeding to the hyperdrive chamber. The saboteurs, who were led by Cham's second in command, [[Isval]], had managed to seal the hatch to the hyperdrive core before any Imperial troops could interrupt them, and Vader began to use his lightsaber to cut it open.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nBy the time Vader finished cutting through the hatch, the saboteurs had already concluded their business and escaped. The main hyperdrive core had been riddled with timed charges, set to detonate if anyone attempted to disarm or remove them. Vader concluded that the ship was lost, and ordered the captain to evacuate. Vader contacted Sidious, who instructed his apprentice to meet him aboard his shuttle. Before departing, however, Vader made one last attempt to kill the saboteurs, but they narrowly evaded him and escaped in an Imperial [[escort boat]]. Subsequently, Vader reunited with the Emperor and left on the shuttle, mere minutes before the Star Destroyer exploded. Shortly thereafter, the Imperial traitor [[Belkor Dray]] provided Cham with the transponder identity of the Emperor's shuttle, and he directed Isval and her group aboard the escort boat to attack it.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nVader's exceptional piloting skills allowed him to evade the boat and then fly upside down over its cockpit within direct visual range of its pilots. Once there, he used the Force to choke both Isval and her co-pilot, but before losing consciousness, Isval rammed the shuttle with her escort boat. The crash disabled the shuttle's main power, and Vader had to use a nearly depleted backup battery to attempt a crash landing on Ryloth. As he guided the ship through the atmosphere, he had flashbacks of events and people from his past. Though distracted, Vader managed to land the ship in Ryloth's equatorial forest region, but his distraction did not go unnoticed by the Emperor, who noted that the landing had been poor compared to what he knew Vader to be capable of.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nNot too long afterward, the Twi'lek insurgents continued their assault on freighters, prompting Vader and the Emperor to take action and destroy them, before moving away from their fallen shuttle. At night, they stopped to rest, when the Emperor questioned his regret and loyalty, but Vader showed himself devoted still. They were soon attacked by a [[lylek]] horde, forcing them to retreat into a tunnel, unaware that they had entered their nest. They stood their ground against hundreds of lyleks and their significantly threatening queen, and killed them all before exiting the tunnel and finding a young Twi'lek, [[Drua]]. When the Emperor tried to kill her, Vader stopped him, intending to have the girl guide them to [[Drua's Village|her village]], where they obtained a communicator to speak with Moff Mors.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nAfter giving them their coordinates, they were finally surrounded by Syndulla's forces, but so did Mors's, aiding them in quelling the rebellion. As the [[stormtrooper]]s killed the Twi'leks, Vader noticed a trio of Twi'leks\u2014Syndulla, Isval and [[Goll]]\u2014watching from afar and went on to kill them, but Goll and Syndulla escaped, leaving Vader to capture Isval and bring her before the Emperor. He mocked her, telling her that her people had accomplished nothing, and Vader subsequently executed her. On the Emperor's orders, Vader then killed the villagers to leave no witnesses, concluding their mission.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\n====Teller's campaign====\n{{Quote|We haven't stood on Coruscant in some time, Governor.''\"<br />\"''The needs of the Empire keep us elsewhere occupied, Lord Vader.''\"<br />\"''Just so.|Darth Vader and Wilhuff Tarkin|Tarkin (novel)}}\nWhen Moff Tarkin's [[Sentinel Base]] was [[Attack on Sentinel Base|attacked]], Vader was stationed in the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, where he held a court with the [[Deputy Director]] of the ISB, [[Harus Ison]], berating [[Coruscanti]] criminals as well as [[Prefect (Coruscant police)|Prefect]] [[Phoca Soot]] of [[Level 1331]], for ignoring the Emperor's decrees. Telling them to move their operations out of Coruscant, Vader then made an example of Soot for his disrespect and crushed his heart with the Force, and adjourned the court to meet with Tarkin and [[Grand Vizier]] Mas Amedda. The latter politely asked Vader to refrain from killing all those who displeased him, to which the Sith replied that he would give thought to the matter, before greeting Tarkin and sharing the latest developments of the Death Star's construction.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\n[[File:Tarkin-Vader.jpg|thumb|right|268px|Vader and Wilhuff Tarkin arrive on Murkhana.]]\nThe pair separated when Vader left Tarkin, who met with the Emperor alone. Afterward, Vader (like Tarkin and Amedda) partook in a meeting between the [[Imperial Ruling Council]], and the leaders of Imperial Security Bureau and [[Naval Intelligence Agency]] in the [[Imperial Palace audience chamber|palace's audience chamber]], overseen by the Emperor. He then assigned Tarkin and Vader to a [[Mission to Murkhana|mission on Murkhana]] to investigate recently discovered [[Shadowfeed]] technology and its relationship to the attack on Sentinel Base. The pair traveled to the planet on the ''Carrion Spike'', which Vader made to carry his [[Darth Vader's meditation chamber|meditation chamber]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nOn Murkhana, however, the ''Spike'' was stolen by [[Berch Teller's rebel cell|unknown dissidents]], prompting Vader and Tarkin to kill the Sugi crime lord [[Faazah]], and take his ''[[Parsec Predator]]'' to pursue the stolen ship, hidden by its cloaking systems. Making use of his connection to his meditation chamber, Vader pinpointed the rebels' location to the [[Fial system]] and later, the [[Galidraan system]], where they [[Attack on Galidraan Station|engaged]] the ''Spike'' before they jettisoned his meditation chamber and escaped to [[Lucazec]]. With the ''Predator'' disabled, Vader and Tarkin boarded the [[Liberator (Venator-class)|''Liberator'']], from which Vader issued his black Eta-2 interceptor to be transported on the ''[[Goliath]]'' from Coruscant.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nOn the ''Goliath'', Tarkin told Vader that the insurgency was surely being supported by someone high up in the [[Imperial Military]], and predicted that the insurgents would go to [[Phindar]] to refuel the ''Spike''. Subsequently, Vader led a [[Yellow Squadron (Galactic Empire)|squadron]] to [[Battle in the Phindar system|attack]] the stolen corvette in the [[Phindar system]]. Though they greatly damaged the ship, it escaped, prompting Tarkin and Vader to calculate its trajectory to [[Obroa-skai system]]. Teller transmitted false intelligence that the insurgents were heading to the Obroa-skai system. Hoping to capture the ''Carrion Spike'', Tarkin and Vader deployed substantial Imperial resources including three [[Interdictor vessel]]s. The prototype [[Immobilizer 418 cruiser]] malfunctioned, yanking several ships out of hyperspace and causing a [[Incident in the Obroa-skai system|massive accident]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nDespite failing to catch the ''Spike'', the Imperials managed to capture the [[YT-1000 light freighter]] ''[[Reticent]]'', which Teller had sent as a decoy to throw the Imperials off-scent. While Vader interrogated its [[Unidentified Koorivar captain|Koorivar captain]] on the ''[[Executrix]]'', Tarkin accessed Imperial databases and discovered the identities of the insurgents, including its leader [[Berch Teller]]. Vader also interrogated the ''Reticent''{{'s}} [[Sy Myrthian]] navigator, who suffered a heart attack. However, Vader learned from one of his contacts in the [[Crymorah syndicate]] that a lieutenant had negotiated a deal with the Sugi crime lord Faazah for a supply of custom [[fuel cell]]s. These fuel cells had reached Murkhana shortly before Tarkin and Vader's arrival, thus confirming that Faazah had been colluding with the insurgents.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\n[[File:Tarkin_novel_art.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Tarkin and Vader, commanders of the Empire]]\nAfter a private holo transmission with the Emperor, Vader told Tarkin that [[Vice Admiral]] [[Dodd Rancit]] was sure the insurgents would attack the [[Carida Academy|Imperial academy]] at [[Carida]] next. Then, Vader parted ways with Tarkin to meet with Rancit, but not before asking for the meaning behind the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} name and Tarkin told him about his test in [[Eriadu]]'s [[Carrion Plateau]]. On the [[Carida system]], Vader boarded the [[Secutor-class Star Destroyer|''Secutor''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Conquest (Secutor-class)|''Conquest'']] and met Rancit just as the ''Spike'' reverted to [[realspace]], astrogating on autopilot. Aware of Rancit's treason, as a co-conspirator of Teller, Vader had [[Lieutenant]] [[Crest]] place Rancit aboard an escape pod and had Rancit give himself the command to issue the fire order that destroyed it. Elsewhere, Tarkin [[Battle near the Gulf of Tatooine|dealt]] with the rebels, ending the [[Berch Teller campaign|insurgency]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nFollowing the defeat of Teller's insurgents, Vader spent the next three weeks helping Tarkin to interrogate the captured insurgents with the exception of Teller, who managed to escape. While none of the insurgents had died under questioning, the Emperor had the insurgents executed privately. Vader also led a crackdown on the warehouse workers and salvages who supplied Teller's dissidents along with several scientists at [[Desolation Station]] who had provided Teller with information. Vader also took action against the [[Tenloss Syndicate]] and lower-level members of the Crymorah syndicate who had assembled [[Berch Teller's warship]], a modified ''Providence''-class Dreadnought.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\n====Submission to Ahr====\nVader later participated in an [[Attack on Namzor|attack]] on the planet [[Namzor]], where he eliminated a group of [[Namzor insurgents|insurgents]]. In the process, he destroyed the rebels' stores of [[coaxium]], violating the command of Imperial [[Governor]] [[Ahr]], who was charged with securing the hyperfuel. The governor brought his frustrations to the Emperor. Sensing Vader's anger, the Emperor commanded his apprentice to follow any and all orders from the governor until Vader had learned his lesson.<ref name=\"Age of Rebellion\">[[Age of Rebellion - Darth Vader 1|''Age of Rebellion - Darth Vader'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Vader on Phelzepham.jpg|300x330px|right|thumb|Darth Vader single-handily defeats a Rebel fortress.]]\nAhr took great pleasure in his newfound power, sending Vader on increasingly dangerous missions throughout his [[Unidentified Mid Rim sector|sector]]. He sent Vader to [[Attack on Ahn Krantarium|fight]] alone against the renegade droids of [[Ahn Krantarium]], and later retracted his forces on [[Phelzepham]], leaving Vader to [[Attack on Phelzepham|battle]] the moon's [[Phelzepham insurgents|insurgents]] by himself. Though he wished to kill the governor, Vader continued to obey Ahr's commands.<ref name=\"Age of Rebellion\" />\n\nGovernor Ahr brought his [[Ahr's Venator-class Star Destroyer|ship]] to the [[Kankalo Belt Containment Zone]], an [[asteroid field]] in which a [[Unidentified creature (Kankalo Belt Containment Zone)|great creature]] resided. He commanded Vader to eliminate \"the greatest threat\" he could find. Seeing an opportunity, Vader confronted Ahr, recognizing him as his true threat. Before Vader could strike, Ahr ordered the Dark Lord to kneel before him. Vader obeyed, but the creature attacked the vessel, pulling the governor out into the void of space and freeing Vader from his submission.<ref name=\"Age of Rebellion\" />\n\n====Hunt on Chandar's Folly====\n{{Quote|Kill me, if you can.|Darth Vader, to Tarkin|Darth Vader (2017) 18}}\nTarkin still owed Vader a favor for capturing Lee-Char on Mon Cala. After some time, Vader came to Tarkin with his request, and, as he learned of Tarkin's hunting, Vader asked Tarkin to hunt him down. Vader told him to keep him on his feet, killing him if he had to. Tarkin was shocked at this and began considering why Vader would ask him to hunt him. Tarkin looked through the reports from the Inquisitorius and saw that Vader's hunt for the Jedi had left him with little to no challenge. Tarkin deduced that Vader wanted to be challenged again and was flattered that he had chosen him.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 18\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 18|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 18]]</ref>\n\nThe hunt took place on the Outer Rim planet [[Chandar's Folly]], and Tarkin immediately began trying to take on the Dark Lord of the Sith. Knowing of Vader's brutal abilities, Tarkin outfitted the hunters with [[slugthrower]]s and [[flamethrower]]s to avoid the possibility of Vader deflecting their shots. On the second day, they cornered Vader at a copse of [[Thurian tree]]s, and four hunters engulfed him with their flamethrowers. As Tarkin watched Vader get covered by the flames, he thought he saw fear in his body language. Vader's possible fear was brief, however, as he targeted the hunters' flamethrowers, incinerating the four hunters. Through the following days, Tarkin saw that Vader was not hard to track, leaving clear signs wherever he went. They learned why as on multiple occasions Vader ambushed them. On one occasion, Tarkin and his hunters were tracking Vader near a cliff when he revealed himself and killed one of the hunters with his. Two others fired on him but failed to kill him.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 18\" />\n\nTarkin realized that as long as Vader had his lightsaber, he couldn't be beaten. So over the course of the next four days, he attempted to steal Vader's weapon. After six men perished, one of Tarkin's hunters managed to snatch it out of Vader's grip while he was fighting. After this, Tarkin saw that not only was Vader turning to new tactics, he was angrier. Tarkin knew that enraged prey was usually easier to take out, but he admitted that this rule did not apply to Vader. Soon after, Vader fought five of Tarkin's hunters as they fired on him, hitting him many times and scarring his armor. Tarkin watched from a hilltop as Vader came close to the hunters and used the Force to snap one's neck. The other hunters retreated, and Vader Force-choked another to death. Once understanding how capable Vader was with the Force, Tarkin assumed that the hunt would soon end. However, Tarkin soon realized that Vader was so keen on getting back his lightsaber, that so long as Tarkin's team hunted him, he hunted them.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 18\" />\n\nOn the ninth day of the hunt, Tarkin was down to his last seven hunters. Vader managed to kill a [[Valath]], the apex predator on the planet, and take its hide, which could help him camouflage better. One of Tarkin's [[Chadra-Fan]] hunters, [[Sissian]], spotted Vader northwest of Tarkin's camp, and the hunter [[Yerga]] notified Tarkin of this. Tarkin got his [[Binoculars/Legends|binoculars]] and saw Vader on top of a peak wearing the Valath hide. Tarkin had his hunters form a group around him, and they walked in Vader's direction. Vader lured them into a ravine of blue crystals, where his breathing could echo and be untraceable by Sissian and his grandfather, [[Hardhear]]. Hardhear heard Vader's breathing, but although he could say Vader was near, he could not say which direction. Vader loomed over them at the top of the ravine and watched as Tarkin ordered his team to run. The group ran down the ravine, and Vader made his move, Force-pushing one of the hunters into the ravine wall. Vader then Force-choked Hardhear before leaping down, under the cover of his Valath hide, and attacking the droid hunter.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 18\" />\n\nTarkin had the rest of his team run into the [[Stormlands]], where it was open ground. They set up camp, and Sissian listened for Vader's breathing. However, Vader had deactivated his suit, which stopped his breathing apparatus from giving him away, and he slowly crept up to the camp, before Force choking Sissian. Yerga attempted to attack Vader, but he took her by the neck and killed her. The last two hunters opened fire, and Vader used the Force to retake his lightsaber. Tarkin then jumped at the two hunters and slaughtered them. Tarkin ran away from Vader, but after realizing he would catch up with him eventually, he stopped and fell to his knees. Vader loomed over him, not realizing that as he was standing higher than Tarkin, he was more susceptible to the lightning in the Stormlands.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 18\" />\n\nWithout warning, Vader was struck by lightning and he fell to the ground. Tarkin got up and contacted his flagship, the ''[[Carrion Spike]]'', to pick them up. Tarkin sat by Vader and waited for the ''Carrion Spike'' to arrive. The corvette soon approached them, being frequently struck by lightning due to its height in the Stormlands. Vader remained immobile and Tarkin told him that whatever he had hoped to learn from this madness, he hoped he had learned it. Tarkin then told Vader that he would get him to a repair bay soon enough. However, Vader wasn't finished yet, and he Force-choked Tarkin, showing him that he hadn't lost just yet. Tarkin soon crawled from the range of Vader's Force abilities, and Vader continued lying there.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 18\" />\n\n====Hunt for Eeth Koth and rogue Inquisitors====\n{{Quote|Fear. Anger.

Vader approached Koth after the birth of his [[Eeth Koth's daughter|daughter]]. Koth offered Vader codes, secret contact frequencies and a way to find other purge survivors, knowing that he was not a threat to anyone. As Koth's wife and child made their escape, Vader fought Koth. Vader then sent the Fifth Brother and the other Inquisitors after Mira and Koth's daughter, and he continued to fight Koth. After the Inquisitors captured Koth's daughter, Vader killed Koth. He then held Koth's child.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 19\" />\n\nVader and the Inquisitors took the child to Coruscant, where Vader met with the Grand Inquisitor and gave the child to two nursemaids that belonged to [[Project Harvester]]. Vader then spoke with the Grand Inquisitor about his next target. The Grand Inquisitor told him that there were still a few Jedi left, but they had vanished with no way to find them. He told Vader they would have to wait.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 19\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 19|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 19]]</ref>\n\nVader confronted the Twi'lek and red-skinned Inquisitors<ref name=\"Dark Lord 19\" /> in the [[Inquisitorius Headquarters]]. Vader sensed a connection between the two Inquisitors due to their previous mission with Vader. Without the assistance of the other Inquisitors, Vader hunted them down. Vader and two Coruscant Guards searched for the two Inquisitors. After Vader's speeder was destroyed, he continued to pursue them through the skylanes until they all landed on a platform. When the Inquisitors refused to kill him, Vader used the Force to activate their lightsabers and kill them.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 20\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 20|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 20]]</ref>\n\n====Building Fortress Vader====\n=====Choosing his own world=====\n{{Quote|I have destroyed the remaining Jedi for you.

Vader told the Emperor that the female Inquisitor allowed Mira and Koth's daughter to briefly escape and only captured the child because she was seen. He also believed they were building a coalition against himself and the Emperor. Despite this, the Emperor was displeased with Vader's pursuit across Coruscant that cost the life of a senator. The Emperor decided to move the Inquisitors to another world. The Emperor asked Vader how Koth tried to hide. Vader said he was posing as a priest, which was the closest thing to a Jedi. Vader was given a reward: Padm\u00e9 Amidala's Naboo Royal Starship. Vader was then ordered by the Emperor to go to Alderaan to deal with Senator Bail Organa. However, to the surprise of his master, Vader refused.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 20\" />\n\nHaving carried out Palpatine's will for so long, Vader was content to continue to do so, but he first he demanded a world of his own. Rejecting Sidious's offer to give him Tatooine or Naboo, Vader asked to be given Mustafar,<ref name=\"Dark Lord 20\" /> the world where he had been defeated by Kenobi. The Emperor agreed to his request and would send Colonel [[Alva Brenne]] to build a facility for him there. Vader was then shown the [[Mask of Lord Momin|Mask]] of [[Darth Momin]] before leaving for Mustafar.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 21\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 21|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 21]]</ref>\n\n=====Return to Mustafar=====\n{{Quote|Perhaps your Padm\u00e9 does await you on Mustafar.

During the  flight, Vader saw a vision of his younger self with a face that matched his mask. Upon entering the planet's atmosphere, Vader deactivated the starship's shields and allowed it to burn as they landed. Once on the planet's surface, Vader commented that the ship looked better burnt. He then told Brenne that he was there to understand a great mystery. While Brenne and Roggo got to work designing Vader's castle, Vader returned to the cave where he bled his kyber crystal. As he reached out to the power within the cave's locus, he was presented with a design for the castle from Brenne, which Vader rejected. However, shortly after leaving, Vader heard Brenne scream and returned to the starship to find her dead. He also discovered that Roggo had donned Momin's mask. Vader attacked Roggo, but stopped upon seeing that he had created a new design for the castle.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 21\" />\n\nRemoving the mask from Roggo's corpse, Vader took the mask into the cave and placed it upon the locus. He then asked the mask who he was, to which he replied \"I am Momin\". Momin proceeded to show Vader his entire life, from creating morbid works of art from the deceased to being trained in the ways of the Sith by [[Darth Shaa]]. After killing his master and studying the lore of the dark side, Momin constructed a weapon which, along with his use of the Force, would freeze a city's population forever at the moment of their deaths. However, an attack by the Jedi caused him to lose control, destroying both the city and himself in the process. As a result, Momin's essence became trapped within his mask, forcing him to take on host after host in order to create his art. Vader placed the mask upon his head, but quickly cast it aside and then departed with it from the cave. Once outside, he engaged in a fight with two Mustafarians, one of which he killed and the other he placed the mask upon. With his new body, Momin explained that his design for the castle was actually a key to open a door to the dark side, which Vader could use to reunite with Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Vader threatened Momin not to offer him things he could not provide and Momin responded that he only wanted another chance to create. Vader accepted Momin's offer, but warned the ancient Sith not to betray him.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 22\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 22|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 22]]</ref>\n\nUnder Momin's guidance, Vader used his Imperial resources to begin construction of his castle. With each new design, Momin insisted that this would be the one to open the door. Though each attempt to do so would subsequently end in failure. And with each failure, Vader would cut down Momin's current body in frustration and place his mask upon a new host. Each new attempt to open the door would also bring ruin to Mustafar itself, prompting the Mustafarians to attack in retaliation.

The events of ''Fallen Order'' occurred five years after the [[Great Jedi Purge|fall]] of the [[Jedi Order]], which is dated to 19 BBY by ''Star Wars: Galactic Atlas''. Therefore, ''Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order'' is also set in 14 BBY.

Finally, ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'' states that [[Fortress Vader]] was finished forty-six years before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]], which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates to [[34 ABY]].

Regardless, Kestis launched multiple futile lightsaber attacks against Vader only for Vader to effortlessly neutralize all of his assaults and telekinetically choke him. Quickly realizing his disadvantage, Cal fled the encounter, after barely surviving by pulling a piece of machinery at his and Vader's direction, forcing Vader to defend himself from that and toss Cal aside, with Vader in hot pursuit.<ref name=\"Jedi Fallen Order\" />\n\nDespite Cal managing to escape from Vader moments before he could enter the elevator, Vader soon managed to catch up to him just as he was about to escape the fortress and attacked him. As he quickly gained the upper hand on Kestis and began to overpower him in a blade-lock, Cal's droid, [[BD-1]], attempted to short-circuit Vader's life-support suit, forcing Vader to disengage and stop the droid. Before he could crush BD-1, Cal made use of the distraction to impale Vader in the mid-section, only for Vader to retaliate by tossing Cal aside once again with the Force and as Cal desperately attempted to fight back and summon his lightsaber back, Vader stopped Cal's lightsaber before it could return to his hand and once again offered a chance for Cal to surrender the holocron and when Cal refused, Vader simply activated the lightsaber and forced it into Cal's mid-section, the same way that Cal attempted to defeat him.<ref name=\"Jedi Fallen Order\" />\n\nMoments later, Junda reappeared to aid Kestis, only to be easily defeated after a short clash of blades, being flung aside. Commenting on the strength of Junda's hatred, Vader was impressed when Junda was able to temporarily bring him to his knees with the dark side of the Force and commented how he could feel it inside of her. Once Junda resisted his efforts to goad her into the darkness, Vader attempted to kill both her and Kestis, but Junda was able to hold it at bay with a force-barrier long enough for Kestis to use the Force to shatter a number of windows surrounding them, causing water to pour into the complex and forcing Vader to use the Force to hold back the flood, as Kestis grabbed Junda and escaped through the opening.<ref name=\"Jedi Fallen Order\" />\n\n=====The final castle=====\n{{Quote|Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.|A voice during Darth Vader's vision|Darth Vader (2017) 25}}\nIn [[12 BBY]],<ref name=\"Vader 14 BBY 12 BBY Chronology Note\" /> Momin's ninth design for Fortress Vader was constructed, which Vader stated would be his final chance. Upon activating this castle, Vader found that he was finally able to open the door. However, before he could enter, he was informed of another attack by the Mustafarians. And while Vader dealt with the attackers, Momin took the opportunity to open the door himself. He then summoned his younger self from the past and placed his mask upon him, thus finally creating his masterpiece; himself.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 23\" />\n\nLeaving the battle, Vader reentered the castle while the Mustafarians continued their attack. Upon returning to the locus, he used the Force to unleash a devastating attack, wiping out the rest of the Mustafarians. Vader was then met in combat by Momin, who mocked Vader for thinking he could control the dark side. As he chastised the Dark Lord for his ignorance about the Force, Vader used the Force to ram Momin with a rock, crushing his new body and killing him. With Momin dead, Vader finally opened the door and stepped inside.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 24\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 24|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 24]]</ref>\n\nAbandoning his physical body, Vader entered a realm in which he experienced visions of his past, present and future. He saw himself as a child haunted by the very form of what he would become. Becoming a child once again, he gradually grew up along with the memories of his upbringing. After experiencing a vision of him dueling his former apprentice Ahsoka Tano, Vader entered another vision of the Jedi Temple and fought against the specters of various Jedi. After disposing of them, Vader journeyed further into the Temple until coming upon the forms of Sheev Palpatine and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who both claimed to be his father. After killing Kenobi, the vision of Palpatine motioned at Vader to stand down, to which Vader responded with a barrage of Force lightning that destroyed the specter.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 25\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 25|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 25]]</ref>\n\nFinally, Vader found himself on a balcony with a vision of Amidala standing before him. Vader, now in the form of Anakin Skywalker, told Amidala to come with him. However, Amidala simply told him that Anakin Skywalker was dead before leaping from the balcony. Vader screamed in agony as the specter of Amidala was destroyed by a bolt of lightning. He then saw a beacon of blue light in the distance. Within the beacon was a figure who activated a blue lightsaber, pushing Vader back and returning him to his body. After awakening in the castle and retrieving his lightsaber, Vader destroyed the dark side locus, sealing off the door,<ref name=\"Dark Lord 25\" /> because he was unable to restore his wife.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Maul\">{{EncyclopediaCite|Darth Maul and Other Dark Side Followers}}</ref>\n\nSometime later, Vader contacted his master and informed him that he was still alive. The Emperor asked Vader if he would return to Coruscant, to which Vader said he soon would. The Emperor then asked Vader if the truth he learned of on Mustafar was what he needed. Vader then hung up and, while standing in front of the finally completed [[Fortress Vader]], answered \"Yes\".<ref name=\"Dark Lord 25\" /> Vader went on to return Momin's mask to Sidious, who placed it in his personal [[yacht]], the ''[[Imperialis]]'', under the watch of two Royal Guards.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Maul\" />\n\n===War with the Rebellion===\n====Lothal====\n{{Quote|We will squeeze Lothal until someone reveals the whereabouts of these traitors.|Darth Vader to Minister Maketh Tua|Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal}}\nDarth Vader contacted the [[Grand Inquisitor]] via hologram with a new mission for him. He informed him that the Emperor had foreseen a new threat\u2014the \"children of the Force.\" He was to hunt down these children and either press them into service of the Empire or eliminate them. The Inquisitor promised Vader that the mission would be done.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" /> After the Inquisitor's [[Action at Mustafar|death]] over Mustafar, the union of several rebel cells was revealed when they rescued the [[Spectres]] from an Imperial fleet. As rumors of what had happened over Mustafar became known, riots and uprisings began to occur on several worlds, including [[Lothal]]. The Emperor, concerned at the rise in rebel activity, sent Vader to Lothal with Tarkin to end the growing rebellion.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kanan_and_Ezra_face_Darth_Vader.png|thumb|right|293px|During his mission to end the rebels in Lothal, Vader faced the Jedi Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan Ezra Bridger.]]\nIn an effort to track down the root of the rebel problem, Vader concocted an elaborate trap in which he intended to track the Spectres back to their primary base of operations. Following his arrival on Lothal, Vader met with [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] and Minister [[Maketh Tua]] to discuss his plans with dealing with the Spectres. During this meeting, he informed Tua that Tarkin intended to hold her accountable for her failure to stop the rebels. Fearing for her life, Tua contacted the Spectres, promising them information in exchange for smuggling her off of Lothal before her meeting with Tarkin. The rebels agreed and returned to Lothal. However, Vader had intended for Tua to contact the rebels in order to lure them back to Lothal and saw to it that a bomb was placed on Tua's shuttle. Once the rebels arrived, they attempted to escape the planet with Tua in her shuttle, only for the bomb to go off as Tua boarded the ship, killing the Minister.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident, Vader had it broadcast all over the planet that the rebels had assassinated Tua in order to discredit them. Vader then ordered Kallus to [[Siege of Lothal|lock down the planet's spaceport]] and publicly announce that any ship attempting to reach orbit would be destroyed. Vader knew that the lockdown, combined with the populace's mistrust of the rebels, would essentially guarantee that they would need to steal a ship in order to escape. As such, he provided a tempting target at the local Imperial garrison; a shuttle capable of hyperspace travel. When the rebels attempted to steal it, Vader confronted them with a small group of stormtroopers. Vader engaged the rebels' Jedi members, Kanan Jarrus,<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" /> who had gone by the name Caleb Dume during the Clone Wars,<ref name=\"Kanan 7\" /> and his apprentice [[Ezra Bridger]], while his troops engaged in a small scale firefight with the other rebels. As his intent was for the rebels to escape, Vader lazily toyed with the two Jedi while their cohorts attempted to launch the shuttle.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nThe confrontation came to an end when two of the rebels threw [[thermal detonator]]s at a number of walkers on the landing pad, damaging their legs and scattering the stormtroopers underneath them. When Vader glanced up at the collapsing walkers, Ezra and Kanan combined their power to telekinetically push him into the path of the falling war machines. Believing him to be dead, the two rebels were instead astounded to see Vader, completely unharmed, use the Force to lift both of the walkers off of himself and drop them behind him. Recognizing that they were hopelessly outmatched, Kanan ordered Ezra to run with him to the commandeered shuttle. Hoping to prevent Vader from pursuing them, [[Sabine Wren]] fired a number of blaster bolts at Vader. He reflected two of them back into her chest and helmet but made no attempt to board the shuttle or otherwise stop it. After the shuttle successfully launched, one of the stormtroopers who had been present for the confrontation assured Vader that he would scramble fighters immediately to intercept it. However, Vader informed him that doing so would not be necessary, as he believed that the rebels would not attempt to leave the planet for some time. Vader later ordered Kallus to destroy [[Lothal re-settlement camp 43|Tarkintown]] in order to draw out the rebels or, failing that, to demoralize them.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\n[[File:Vader_attacks_the_Phoenix_fleet.png|thumb|left|277px|Vader engages Phoenix Squadron]]\nShortly thereafter, the rebels used the stolen shuttle to escape the planet and rendezvous with the rebel fleet. However, Vader had placed a tracking device on board the shuttle, and mere minutes after the rebels had reached the fleet, [[Darth Vader's TIE Advanced|Vader's]] [[TIE Advanced x1]] fighter dropped out of hyperspace and [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (4 BBY)|attacked Phoenix Squadron]]. The rebel CO deployed the [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing interceptors]] of [[Phoenix Squadron]], but they were unexpectedly decimated by Vader's lone assault. Weaving through the defensive screen of fighters, Vader attacked the rebel [[command ship]], ''[[Phoenix Home]]'', disabling it in short order. The Spectres quickly boarded their ship, the ''[[Ghost]]'', and fought back against the Dark Lord. However, neither the ''Ghost'' nor the remainder of Phoenix Squadron could land so much as a hit on Vader's craft, and he continued to bombard the now-crippled ''Phoenix Home'' while picking off interfering fighters at his leisure.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nWith its fighter escort all but destroyed and its weapons, shields, and engines disabled, the rebel command ship appeared to be doomed as Vader prepared for a final assault. However, on board the ''Ghost'', Ahsoka Tano decided to combine her powers with Kanan's in order to probe Vader's mind with the Force. The probe enabled Ahsoka to see deeply enough into Vader's mind for her to recognize him as her former master, and for Vader to recognize the one probing him as his former apprentice. Ahsoka promptly lost consciousness as a result of the psychic backlash of the probe but Vader was unaffected, and upon discovering Ahsoka's presence aboard the rebel craft, Vader's priorities immediately changed. In an unexpected turn of good fortune for the rebels, Vader broke off what would have been a killing run at ''Phoenix Home'' in favor of engaging the [[VCX-100 light freighter]].<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nAs Vader peppered the ''Ghost'' with blaster fire, Kanan and [[Hera Syndulla]] managed to convince [[Jun Sato]] to evacuate ''Phoenix Home'' as Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]] entered the system with three Star Destroyers. The Admiral contacted Vader in order to receive instructions, and Vader ordered Konstantine to block the ''Ghost''{{'s}} escape, but not to fire at it, as he wanted the rebels aboard it alive. Meanwhile, the crew of ''Phoenix Home'' abandoned the crippled command ship and fled the system with the tattered remains of the rebel fleet. As Vader closed in on the ''Ghost'', it jumped to hyperspace just as the Destroyers activated their [[tractor beam]]s, catching Vader instead of the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nFollowing his victory, Vader boarded Konstantine's Destroyer and contacted the Emperor. He informed his master that he had \"broken\" the rebels, but the elder Sith Lord sensed disquiet in his apprentice's emotions. Vader then revealed to the Emperor that he had discovered that Tano was alive, and told his master that he believed that she was in league with the rebels. Pleased by this news, the Emperor declared that she could lead the two Sith Lords to other Jedi who survived Order 66. Vader immediately postulated that Kenobi might be amongst them, to which the Emperor concurred; if Kenobi was still alive. The Emperor urged Vader to be patient, and instructed him to send another Inquisitor to hunt the rebels down.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" /> As per his master's orders, Vader assigned the Fifth Brother the task.<ref name=\"Relics of the Old Republic\">{{Rebels|Relics of the Old Republic}}</ref><ref name=\"Always Two There Are\">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to capture the rebel Jedi, the Fifth Brother and [[Seventh Sister]] pursued Jarrus, Bridger, and Tano to a still-standing [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple on Lothal]]. Though the rebels managed to flee, the Inquisitors informed Vader of their discovery. Vader came to inspect the site, informing them that the Emperor would be most pleased by their discovery. The Inquisitors warned Vader that the Jedi were becoming more powerful, but he retorted it would be their undoing.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\n====Duel on Malachor====\n{{Quote|Ahsoka...! Ahsoka...''\"<br />\"''Anakin... I won't leave you. Not this time.''\"<br />\"''...Then you will ''die''.|Darth Vader and Ahsoka Tano|Twilight of the Apprentice}}\n[[File:Twilight_of_the_Apprentice_thumb.png|thumb|right|287px|Vader duels with his former apprentice, Ahsoka Tano.]]\nAfterwards, Vader [[Mission to Malachor|dispatched]] the Fifth Brother, the Seventh Sister and the [[Eighth Brother]] to hunt down Maul, who had been stranded on [[Malachor]] and had been studying its [[Sith temple]] for years; he himself arrived after Bridger had activated the [[Malachor superweapon|superweapon]] with the [[Sith holocron]]. With his Inquisitors having all been killed by Maul, Vader chose to personally retrieve the holocron and take possession of the superweapon. Perched on the roof of his TIE Advanced x1, he leaped from the fighter and landed in front of Bridger. After a brief verbal exchange, Vader quickly disarmed the young Jedi by destroying [[Ezra Bridger's lightsaber|his lightsaber]] and prepared to execute him, but before he could do so, he was interrupted by Ahsoka Tano.<ref name=\"Twilight of the Apprentice\">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>\n\nVader offered his former apprentice clemency in exchange for the location of any surviving Jedi, but Tano claimed that there were no more Jedi; that Vader and his [[Brother/Sister|Inquisitors]] had [[Jedi hunter|killed]] them all. Skeptical of her claim, Vader obliquely threatened to torture the information out of Bridger instead. This prompted Tano to proclaim in disgust that while she had begun to suspect that Vader and her former master were one and the same, she could no longer believe that due to Vader's cruelty. Vader replied that Skywalker had been weak and that he himself had destroyed her former master. Tano then swore to avenge Skywalker, but Vader reminded her that revenge was not the Jedi way. But Tano no longer considered herself to be a Jedi, and after informing Vader of this, she attacked him. However, she proved ultimately to be no match for her former master who, after several minutes of intense swordplay, used the Force to [[Force push|blast]] Tano off a ledge. Believing her to have been neutralized, Vader went to retrieve the holocron.<ref name=\"Twilight of the Apprentice\" />\n\n[[File:Then_you_will_die.png|thumb|left|272px|Vader's face beneath his damaged mask]]\nVader managed to catch up to Jarrus and Bridger before they could board their ship, and used the Force to begin pulling both the holocron and the two Jedi towards him. But before he could seize it, Tano ambushed Vader and managed to slice off the upper right portion of his mask with [[Ahsoka Tano's white lightsabers|her lightsabers]]. With his mask damaged, Vader's voice filter began to malfunction, and when he next spoke, calling out to his former apprentice, it was in a distorted mixture of his real voice and the mechanical baritone imposed by the filter. This and his partially exposed face confirmed to Tano that Vader was indeed her former master. As the Temple locked down, Tano proclaimed she would not abandon him as she had before. Vader paused at this and stared wordlessly at Tano for a few moments. However, he quickly regained his composure and snarled that she would die for her choice. The two engaged in combat once more, while Jarrus and Bridger escaped from the chamber enclosing Vader and Tano.<ref name=\"Twilight of the Apprentice\" />\n\nAfter a few moments of battle, locked his blade with Tano's and began to push through her guard. As he prepared to kill her, the energy discharges from the overloading holocron stand suddenly intensified, and Vader glanced up. As he did, a massive blast of power struck the ceiling of the chamber, and Tano used the distraction to push Vader back a step with the Force. She then drove both of her lightsabers into the ground at her feet, causing the floor of the chamber to begin crumbling. Vader quickly recovered from his distraction and aimed a killing stroke at Tano. Unbeknownst to the two combatants, however, two years later, Ezra Bridger had entered an ancient temple which allowed for Force-based time travel. Having been guided to a portal which exited at the Sith temple, he witnessed the conclusion of Vader's battle with Tano even as his younger self was locked out of the holocron chamber. As Vader swung his lightsaber at Tano, Bridger reached through the portal and yanked her backward into the temple. As a result, Vader's strike missed and the temple floor crumbled, sending Vader plummeting into a pool of light.<ref name=\"A World Between Worlds\">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref> Vader survived the fall and, believing that Tano had perished in the explosion, managed to make his way back to the surface, after which he returned to his duties.<ref name=\"Twilight of the Apprentice\" />\n\n====Meeting Thrawn====\n{{Quote|I have heard a great deal about you, I am pleased we have finally met.''\"<br />\"''Yes, as am I.|Grand Admiral Thrawn and Darth Vader|Thrawn (novel)}}\nShortly after Malachor,{{Fact}} Vader arrived at the Imperial Palace on Coruscant and was introduced to the newly promoted [[Grand Admiral]] Thrawn, the very same Chiss officer he had met during the Clone Wars, by the Emperor. When Thrawn stated he was pleased to finally meet the dark lord, Vader claimed to feel the same.<ref name=\"Thrawn\">[[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']]</ref>\n\n====Investigating a disturbance in the Force====\n{{Quote|Anakin Skywalker is dead.''\"<br />\"''I know.|Darth Vader and Grand Admiral Thrawn|Thrawn: Alliances}}\nVader and Thrawn crossed paths on Coruscant once more after Thrawn suffered a strategic [[Battle of Atollon|defeat]] on [[Atollon]].<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> Although the battle had been a tactical victory, a number of rebels had escaped the Grand Admiral after the [[Bendu]] appeared.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref> As a result of allowing the rebels to slip through his grip, Vader now held a disdain for the Grand Admiral. Though during this meeting, the two were ordered by the Emperor to the planet Batuu to locate a disturbance in the Force that the Emperor had sensed. While Thrawn brought his own forces on board his Star Destroyer, the ''[[Chimaera]]'', Vader brought a contingent of his personal stormtroopers from the 501st Legion, the [[First Legion]] with him to assist in tracking down this disturbance at the edge of known space. During their mission, they [[Imperial\u2013Grysk conflict|combated]] the [[Grysk]] species. While Thrawn managed to deduce that Skywalker and Vader were one in the same, the Grand Admiral came to think of Vader as being a separate person mentally and that his old ally Skywalker was dead. Vader came to respect Thrawn's [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter]] project, stating he would speak on its behalf to Palpatine and suggesting upgrades for the craft.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\n====World Between Worlds====\nSometime later, Bridger managed to enter the [[World Between Worlds]]. There, he heard Anakin Skywalker's voice when he was on Christophsis. Vader's voice was then heard telling an individual to not underestimate the power of the dark side.<ref name=\"A World Between Worlds\" />\n\n====Cianap====\n[[File:VaderHorse.png|thumb|right|250px|Vader rode the Cianap riding creature to fight the Ender.]]\nVader led Imperial forces at [[Cianap]] in a [[Battle above Cianap|battle]] against the rebels. During the battle, Vader was targeted by several X-wings but was able to take them out. However, his TIE was damaged when one purposely crashed into him and was forced to crash land on Cianap. Vader then exited his TIE and awoke an [[Ender]] from its [[Slumber]]. The Ender then tried to kill Vader; however, he stabbed one of the Ender's eyes out and tried to cut its back open, only for the Ender to grab him. Vader started to slice the Ender's fingers, but the Ender pushed him into a building and dropped him. The Ender then started to go after a [[Unidentified Cianap native|native]], but Vader rode a [[Unidentified Cianap riding creature|creature]] and saved the native from the Ender. Vader then decapitated the Ender, finally killing it. The native thanked Vader, who then returned to his TIE and was taken aboard a Star Destroyer via tractor beam.<ref name=\"Dark visions 1\">[[Vader - Dark Visions 1|''Vader - Dark Visions'' 1]]</ref>\n\n====An unwelcome romance====\nAt some point, Vader had arrived the Death Star, and made his way to his personal medical bay. As he made way, he barged through a medical cart being tended to by a [[Unidentified Imperial nurse|nurse]], who was flustered due to her infatuation with Vader. Vader underwent treatment from a [[Unidentified Imperial doctor (Darth Vader)|doctor]] while in the medical bay, but became angered when the nurse from the prior encounter entered the medical bay as Vader was putting his helmet back on. In his anger, Vader force pushed the doctor into the wall, demanding that he control the medical bay or be replaced. The nurse, however, saw Vader's anger as reciprocation of her feelings for him, misconstruing his actions as protection of her. After his bout of rage, Vader exited the medical bay, admonishing the doctor as he attempted to excuse why the appointment had taken so long. The nurse, upon being told to clean up the medical bay, instead stole pieces of Vader's armor as a keepsake, storing it among other discarded pieces of Vader's armor, as well as a vial of his blood.<ref name=\"Dark Visions 3\">[[Vader - Dark Visions 3|''Vader - Dark Visions'' 3]]</ref>\n\nA proceeding incident resulted in Vader crash landing on the Death Star in his TIE Advanced x1. Vader made his way to the medical bay oncemore, demanding the nurse to call in the doctor. The nurse briefly aided Vader, perceiving the moment as intimate, before the doctor himself returned, ordering the nurse to leave as he tended to Vader instead. Vader, impatient, cut his appointment short, leaving to rejoin his prior battle. However, Vader had left his cape behind, which the nurse proceeded to steal and take to her quarters. After the doctor discovered her, he dumped the bits of Vader's armor into the trash compactor. Driven mad, the nurse walked into Vader's quarters, which he had left unlocked out of a belief that no one would enter. Upon seeing the nurse enter his chambers, a helmetless Vader simply stared at her as she confessed her infatuation with him. Momentarily after, Vader stabbed the nurse with his lightsaber, killing her. Vader then put his helmet back on and exited his quarters, contacting the bridge and ordering them to remove her corpse.<ref name=\"Dark Visions 3\" />\n\n====Battle against the Benathy====\n{{Quote|I remember when another like you came here with demands.

The imperial army consisted of at least several thousand stormtroopers, AT-AT walkers, AT-STs, TIE fighters and TIE bombers. While thousands died on both sides, Vader managed to kill the [[Unidentified Benathy king|king]] of the Benathy. Vader ordered his troops to attack and despite the high amount of casualties, he did not retreat.

He informed Vader that [[Director]] Krennic, the Imperial in charge of the construction of the Death Star, had arrived as summoned to explain a number of recent problems involving the battle station. The most pressing of these problems was the discovery that Galen Erso, an engineer who had played a pivotal role in the creation of the Death Star's superlaser, had been a traitor and that there was a distinct possibility that he had leaked information about the weapon to the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Rogue1\">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:VaneeComiccover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vane\u00e9 approaching Vader's bacta tank]]\nKrennic had been recently informed by Governor Tarkin that he was no longer in command of the Death Star project, and was keen to impress upon Vader his need for an audience with the Emperor, ostensibly to discuss the weapon's destructive capabilities. Vader instead chastised Krennic for the destruction of [[Jedha]] City, the city where the Empire had been mining the kyber crystals needed for the Death Star's primary weapons systems to function. Krennic attempted to shift the blame for the city's destruction to Tarkin, but Vader was unmoved. He informed Krennic that the [[Imperial Senate]] had been told that Jedha had been destroyed in a mining disaster and that the Death Star did not exist. He then impressed upon the director in no uncertain terms that he was to make certain that Galen Erso had not compromised the Death Star in any way. Taking this as confirmation from Vader that he was still in command of the project, Krennic began to ask Vader if he would speak to the Emperor on his behalf. But before he could finish his question, Vader cut him off by telekinetically closing his throat, with a sardonic warning to not \"choke\" on his aspirations.<ref name=\"Rogue1\" />\n\n====Stolen plans====\n{{Quote|The rebel flagship is disabled, my Lord.

As the Rebels began to flee to hyperspace, Vader arrived at the scene of the battle in the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator]]'' and quickly crippled the already damaged Rebel flagship. He and a small group of stormtroopers then boarded the vessel and began searching for the plans. As the Rebel crew began to evacuate the ''Profundity'', a small group of [[Rebel trooper]]s copied the Death Star schematics onto a data disk and attempted to board the [[CR90 corvette|Corellian corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]'' and escape. Mere meters away from one of the corvette's airlocks, the ''Profundity'' experienced a power loss, jamming an automatic door in the path of the Rebel soldiers.<ref name=\"Rogue1\" />\n\nUnable to get the door to open more than a few centimeters, the Rebels were intercepted by Vader, who used the enclosed space of the airlock and his Force powers to slaughter the comparatively helpless Rebels.

While Vader finished eliminating the remaining soldiers, the trooper to whom the plans had been passed dove through the open airlock to the ''Tantive IV'', and the Rebels managed to launch the ship mere moments before Vader was able to board it.

The ''Devastator'' intercepted the ''Tantive IV'' in orbit above Tatooine, and quickly disabled and captured it. Vader and his troops boarded the ship, killing many Rebel troopers and gaining complete control of the blockade runner. Vader interrogated its captain, [[Raymus Antilles]], before killing him for not revealing the location of the plans. Vader's troops captured the princess, but not before she placed the plans inside R2-D2 and sent him in an escape pod to the planet's surface.

Before he could kill him, Tarkin intervened and instructed Vader to find the location of the Rebel base from Organa. Subsequently, Vader went to torture her with a [[mind probe]]-equipped [[interrogator droid]], but as she resisted, he and Tarkin turned to coercion\u2014by bringing the Death Star to the [[Alderaan system]], they threatened to destroy her homeworld if she refused to disclose the location of the Rebel base. Eventually, she told him that the Rebels were on Dantooine, yet Tarkin ordered Alderaan to be destroyed anyway, to make an effective demonstration of the Death Star's power.

Identified as a suspicious ship from [[Mos Eisley]], Vader concluded that they were trying to return the stolen plans to the Princess and went to inspect the freighter himself. Told that the crew had apparently abandoned ship after take-off, Vader gave orders for the ship to be scanned to be sure. At the same time, Vader sensed the presence of his old master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. When news reached him that the Princess had been [[Rescue of Princess Leia|released]] from her cell, Vader decided to confront Kenobi alone.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Vaderstrike.png|thumb|right|248px|Vader strikes down his former master and friend, Kenobi.]]\nVader found Kenobi after he had deactivated a tractor beam terminal to allow the ''Falcon'' escape the battle station, and the two engaged in one final duel. During the fight, Vader noted that Kenobi's age had made him weak. However, Kenobi told his former apprentice that he wouldn't win because he would become more powerful than Vader could ever imagine, even if he managed to kill him. As they fought, the two reached Bay 327 just as Kenobi's companions and the Princess reunited to board the ''Falcon'', only for Kenobi to see his latest apprentice, Luke Skywalker, Vader's son.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nAs his former master gave him a mysteriously knowing smile, Vader struck him down when Kenobi raised his blade in surrender. Much to Vader's surprise, Kenobi's body disappeared, for his spirit had become one with the Force, and Vader tried to find remains in his robes but found none.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> As he did so, General [[Moradmin Bast]] asked who he was, and Vader answered \"An old man who thought he could help gifted children.

As he continued his journey, Yoda reflected on his past, blaming himself for not noticing Skywalker's path to the dark side.<ref name=\"There is Another\">{{Shortstory|story=There is Another|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\n====Yavin 4====\n{{Quote|The Force is strong in this one.|Darth Vader, about Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nVader's plan worked and the Death Star followed the ''Falcon'' to the hidden Rebel base on [[Yavin 4]]. As the Death Star prepared to destroy the moon, Rebel [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wings]] and [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wings starfighters]] [[Battle of Yavin|attacked]] the Death Star, having identified a weakness: a [[thermal exhaust port]] which led to the reactor systems; a direct hit on the port would cause a chain reaction and the destruction of the station. Though Tarkin remained convinced in the station's invulnerability, Vader ordered all fighters to launch and destroy the Rebel ships. When [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]] broke off from the main group and begun a trench run towards the exhaust port, Vader boarded his TIE Advanced and, flanked by two TIE fighters, managed to terminate three of the last four Gold Squadron pilots. He continued to destroy most ships of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], killing [[Red Leader]] [[Garven Dreis]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Death_star_trench.png|thumb|left|279px|Vader in his TIE Advanced x1 during the Battle of Yavin]]\nAs the last members of Red Squadron engaged in a trench run while the Death Star was preparing the destroy the moon, Vader damaged [[Wedge Antilles]]'s X-wing, forcing him to break off formation, and killed [[Biggs Darklighter]], leaving only the leader of the group, Luke. Vader quickly realized that the Force was powerful in the young pilot, but nevertheless proceeded to get him into range. When he finally succeeded, he was just about to destroy the young pilot when the newly arrived ''Millennium Falcon'' intervened and destroyed one of Vader's escorts. Before the ''Falcon'' could destroy Vader, his other escort accidentally bumped into Vader's craft, destroying the other escort and causing Vader's craft to veer off course and send him plunging into space. This prevented him from stopping the Death Star's destruction, which killed Tarkin and was a major defeat for the Empire.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:VaderAboardGozanti.png|thumb|right|204px|Vader is picked up by Ciena Ree and Berisse Sai.]]\nShortly after the battle, Vader sent a distress signal to the ''Devastator'' to send a ship to pick him up and bring him back from the [[Yavin system]] to the Star Destroyer. Sometime later, he would fly just beyond the ever-expanding debris field that once was the Death Star, when Imperial pilots [[Ciena Ree]] and [[Berisse Sai]] arrived in a [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]]. Docking his TIE Advanced x1 with the freighter, Vader passed through the airlock door and met Ree. Then, he ordered Ree and Sai to remain in the hold for the remainder of the voyage while he took command of the freighter until they returned to the ''Devastator''.<ref name=\"LS\">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>\n\n====Post-Yavin ventures====\nSometime later, an Imperial officer managed to obtain one of two [[Darth Atrius' lightsabers|lightsabers]] formerly owned by the Sith [[Darth Atrius]]. Vader arrived on [[Hradreek]], where the officer welcomed him, supported by a contingent of stormtroopers. Vader looked at the lightsaber and asked where the other one was. The officer was confused by his question, and Vader Force-choked him. As he gagged, he claimed that he bought the lightsaber from a smuggler and that she must have tricked him. Vader told a stormtrooper to divert all divisions to finding the smuggler and the other lightsaber. Vader then killed the officer as the stormtroopers scattered to begin the search.<ref name=\"SW annual 4\">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 4|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\nA squad of stormtroopers found the smuggler, [[Sana Starros]], and they chased her down the streets. Starros paid a gang of [[Aqualish]] to stall them, and they got in the way of the stormtroopers. However, Vader appeared and cut them down using his lightsaber and Darth Atrius'. Vader then followed Starros' path to a cargo bay, and he used the Force to move the crates and block her from a clear exit. Starros then shot at Vader, and he used the Force to disperse the plasma bolts. Starros rigged one of the crates and then waited for Vader to follow before detonating it, throwing Vader to the side and burying him. Vader soon freed himself and made his way to the nearby podracing track. Vader entered the seating area, and the audience scattered at his presence. Vader noticed one of the podracers, who was grabbing the attention of the commentary. The human, despite being biologically unequipped for a race like this, was winning the race, and Vader used the Force to cause one of the engines to malfunction, crashing the podracer. The pilot of the racer was none other than Luke Skywalker, who had obtained the other of Atrius' lightsabers. Luke decided to destroy the lightsaber, as it overwhelmed him with anger whenever he needed it. Vader watched him escape in his X-wing, and he decided to crush Atrius' other lightsaber.<ref name=\"SW annual 4\" />\n\nAccording to a tale later told by Vane\u00e9, at another point after the Battle of Yavin, Vader's Star Destroyer was contacted by [[Cranwell]], the assistant to [[Tarkin Initiative]] scientist [[Restin]], to warn them that Doctor Restin had betrayed the Empire. Restin, who wanted a weapon to use against Vader as revenge for the destruction of Alderaan, had created a [[Gamorrean Serum|genetic serum]] that would turn those injected with it into rampaging Gamorreans, who could then spread the infection by touch. Vader decided to deal with Restin himself, so he arrived at Restin's base of operations with two stormtroopers and pretended to not know he was a traitor. After witnessing the doctor turn Cranwell into a Gamorrean with the serum, Vader suggested the serum could be used against the Rebellion. When Restin turned the infected Gamorrean against the Sith Lord, he effortlessly lifted it and his infected stormtroopers into the air with the Force. He did the same with Restin, forcing the scientist to confess his treachery before revealing he had already known he was a traitor. Intending to be a firsthand witness to his destruction, Vader forced the three Gamorreans and Restin to touch, transforming the doctor into one of his creations. Leaving the infected scientist to the mercy of the Gamorreans, Vader left aboard his ''Lambda''-class shuttle. He had never feared Restin's experiments, as Vader already viewed himself as a different kind of monster.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader's Castle\" />\n\n====Cymoon 1====\n{{Quote|He's here. The Rebel pilot who destroyed the Death Star. I can feel his presence. He will not escape me again.|Darth Vader|Star Wars (2015) 1}}\nSeveral weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader was called to [[Weapons Factory Alpha]] on [[Cymoon 1]]. He was to [[Assault on Cymoon|negotiate]], or rather force an arrangement with an envoy of Jabba the Hutt about supplying raw materials through [[Hutt Space|Hutt-controlled space]] to the factory. Vader arrived shortly after the envoy (secretly the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} captain, [[Han Solo]]) and landed on a platform. As he was about to enter the facility, Vader was shot at by a sniper, [[Chewbacca]], but he deflected the blaster bolt and used two stormtroopers as human shields as the Wookiee rained down dozens of shots upon him. Unscathed, Vader located Chewbacca's position and used to the Force to collapse his vantage point, but the Wookiee survived.<ref name=\"SW1\">[[Star Wars (2015) 1|''Star Wars'' (2015) 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Vader_bests_luke.png|thumb|left|302px|Vader easily bests Luke Skywalker in combat.]]\nVader then ordered the arriving stormtrooper reinforcements to hunt him down. One of them informed the Dark Lord that [[Overseer (assignment)|Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]] was out of contact and the factory's main reactor was on meltdown. As he surmised these occurrences were the work of Rebels, Vader put the entire moon on alert but also felt the presence of the pilot who had destroyed the Death Star, Luke Skywalker. Although unaware of the boy's identity, Vader made his way into the factory at once and came face-to-face with the Jedi apprentice.<ref name=\"SW1\" /> Vader soon realized that the boy had been cursorily trained by Kenobi, and after the briefest of duels, snatched Luke's lightsaber. As he prepared to execute Luke for his refusal to disclose information about the Rebellion, he realized that the boy's lightsaber had once been his own. Before he could question Luke further, the foot of a Rebel-hijacked [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walker]] came hurtling down into the middle of their standoff, knocking the two apart.<ref name=\"SW2\">[[Star Wars (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' (2015) 2]]</ref>\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Vader sought to prevent the Rebels' escape, and mowed down the factory's runaway slaves, commanding his stormtroopers to execute all the escapees. Once Luke got away on a stolen [[74-Z speeder bike]] and attacked Vader's troops (leading the Dark Lord to reconsider his initial dismissal of the boy and wonder exactly what Kenobi had been up to before his death), Vader personally saw to the walker's defeat. Solo and Organa, commanding the AT-AT, tried to step on him, but Vader used the Force to hold the walker's descending foot several meters above his head, and almost tore it apart.<ref name=\"SW2\" />\n\n[[File:Vader_kills_the_walker.jpg|thumb|right|247px|Vader brings the AT-AT to its knees.]]\nHe was foiled, however, when Solo and Organa unleashed a barrage of the AT-AT's laser fire upon him, causing him to lose his old lightsaber (which the current owner retrieved), and his mask and helmet. As he emerged from under a pile of rubble, a stormtrooper approached; upon seeing Vader's scarred face, he tried to apologize. However, Vader killed him by twisting his head around using the Force, right before Aggadeen reached him via comlink and asked for the facility's evacuation. Vader vetoed his request, had him repair the core, and ordered to kill all the Rebel invaders, except for the boy, whom Vader would deal with personally.<ref name=\"SW2\" /> As Aggadeen informed him that they had successfully defused the reactor, Vader personally fell the Rebel walker by slashing its legs with his lightsaber.<ref name=\"SW3\">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref>\n\nAs reinforcements arrived, Vader sent them after the Rebels on the trash fields, while he pursued the lone Rebel who was returning to the factory, Luke. Aboard a [[Imperial combat speeder|combat speeder]], Vader chased Luke into the facility, but the Rebel managed to destroy the power core with the speeder bike, leaving Vader as the only survivor among the factory's rubble following its explosion. The Sith Lord then saw Luke's abandoned speeder and the fleeing ''Millennium Falcon''; as the ''[[Adjudicator]]''{{'s}} captain, [[Kronn]], informed him that they had been unable to catch the freighter, Vader Force-choked the captain to death. Then, as if he were talking to Kenobi, Vader vowed to find the boy's identity and to turn him to the dark side, so that the boy became his weapon, and not Kenobi's.<ref name=\"SW3\" />\n\n====Yavin's aftermath====\n{{Quote|But you are the only one living to suffer my anger.

I will crush the Rebels.''\"<br />\"''No. I think not.|Sidious and Vader discuss Vader's failings|Darth Vader (2015) 1}}\nThereupon, Vader returned to the Imperial Palace on Coruscant to report to the Emperor, bringing Aggadeen with him. The Emperor bid Vader to explain the events of Weapons Factory Alpha, which along with the Death Star's destruction, had put the Empire very near disaster. Although Vader considered Aggadeen to be responsible for the failure on Cymoon 1 (and the Overseer was tortured accordingly), the Emperor claimed much of the responsibility lay in Vader's head, as he reminded him that he was the sole survivor of the greatest disaster in the Empire's history\u2014one partially caused by his idea to tag the ''Falcon'' with a homing beacon and let it escape with the Death Star plans. He then informed Vader that Cassio Tagge, now [[Grand General]] of the [[Imperial Army]], would be his commanding officer for some time.<ref name=\"DV1\" />\n\n[[File:Palpatine_Vader_agent.jpg|thumb|left|287px|Vader angrily leaves his master and the agent, Cylo-IV.]]\nThe Emperor then ordered Vader to continue the unfinished Cymoon 1 negotiations with Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, right before going to Tagge. As they returned to his office, Sidious greeted one of his agents, Cylo, and Vader asked for his identity, but the Emperor denied him the knowledge. Instead, he asked Vader if there was anything else to report, but Vader chose not to tell him about Kenobi's mysterious disappearance, nor the Force-sensitive Rebel pilot who had destroyed the Death Star and left the office and palace altogether. He boarded an Imperial Star Destroyer and immediately left for Tatooine, sending the Imperial vessel back to collect the trade goods for the meeting.<ref name=\"DV1\" />\n\n====Tatooine negotiations====\n{{Quotetrans|Hmmm.

However, Jabba would rather claim the bounty on Vader's head and had his people shoot at him, but Vader killed them and forced Jabba to reconsider his position. After being Force choked, the Hutt admitted he found it hard not to respect him. The two then came to an agreement: Jabba would provide Vader with two of his best bounty hunters. Vader left the Hutt's palace and sought out a [[Unidentified Tusken Raider village|Tusken Raider camp]], wherein he mercilessly slaughtered its inhabitants. He was then approached by Jabba's envoys: Boba Fett and [[Black Krrsantan]]. While he sent Fett to find and capture the [[Rebel pilot]] from Yavin alive, Vader assigned the Wookiee to bring Palpatine's agent to him. Both [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] agreed, and Vader departed Tatooine for his Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"DV1\" />\n\n[[File:Vader_and_jabba_sitting_in_a_tree.jpg|thumb|right|226px|Vader and Jabba on the latter's sail barge]]\nThe following day, Vader returned in his official capacity as the Emperor's envoy to negotiate as if nothing had happened the day before. Jabba welcomed Vader and claimed that his resources belonged to the Empire as long as he was paid. Vader then turned to leave, leaving his stormtroopers to tell Jabba what was required, but the Hutt invited him to a feast and entertainment in his honor, for he liked to seal his business ventures by watching someone die. Aboard the [[sail barge]] ''[[Khetanna]]'', Vader and Jabba watched as the latter's guards killed wild [[bantha]]s for the sport until Jabba's court [[jester]], [[Salacious B. Crumb]], let out a loud cackle. Vader warned the Hutt to not let the [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] do that again in his presence if he valued Crumb's life; Jabba merely laughed and told Vader he now regarded him as a \"good friend.\" The Hutt then inquired whether his bounty hunters were adequately serving his needs; though Vader berated him for bringing up the private matter, he also told the Hutt that their missions were simple enough: to capture an Imperial agent and a boy. Jabba argued that the \"boy\" had destroyed the Death Star, and had possibly been trained by Kenobi. The name prompted Vader to request that Jabba tell him all he knew of Kenobi's exile on Tatooine.<ref name=\"SW4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\nJabba first required someone screaming, though, so he ordered his guards to pilot the ''Khetanna'' to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]]. He expected Vader to be impressed by the [[sarlacc]], which he believed was one of the few treasures that Tatooine had to offer, and said he found it hard to believe that anyone of note (like the Yavin pilot) could have ever been born on Tatooine. In silence, Vader watched his homeworld's sunset.<ref name=\"SW4\" />\n\n====Servitude unto Tagge====\n{{Quote|You should think of yourself as your lightsaber.

During a time of many raids against ships carrying Jabba's weapons and equipment supplies, Vader was sent to protect an Imperial shuttle, ''[[CZ-246]]'', from a pirate [[Skirmish over an unidentified green planet|attack]]. With his TIE Advanced, Vader went to their aid, alongside [[Black Two]] and [[Black Three]], and successfully disabled the automated CR90 corvette attacking the shuttle. Upon returning to the ''Annihilator'', Vader reported to Tagge that the pirate vessel had been captured and that he suspected a security breach.<ref name=\"DV2\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 2|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 2]]</ref>\n\nAs he said so, Tagge disagreed, believing the raids to be predictable piracy, and admitted to seeing the Death Star as \"Tarkin's folly.\" Vader noted that Tarkin at least had a vision, prompting Tagge to admit his plans were not as grand as Tarkin's or Vader's, but they still were effective; he believed that the Empire could not be based around a single asset, like the Death Star or Vader himself. Tagge then informed Vader that he intended to repair the corvette and use it to [[Attack on an unidentified pirate base|attack]] its [[Unidentified pirate space station|base of origin]], sending Vader to head the attack, although with an [[adjutant]], Lieutenant [[Oon-ai]].<ref name=\"DV2\" />\n\nVader left to prepare for the mission and oversee the repairs on the corvette. Oon-ai followed, asking permission to look into Vader's personal communications to provide information to Tagge. Although it annoyed Vader, as it was the Emperor's command that he serve under Tagge, he allowed it and left. He then planted treasonable evidence into a [[Unidentified black astromech droid|black astromech]] so as to incriminate Oon-ai during the mission. Soon thereafter, Vader, Oon-ai and six stormtroopers boarded the corvette and found the pirate base, docking with the station. Greeted by a [[Unidentified Twi'lek pirate|Twi'lek pirate]], whom he killed, Vader ordered the troopers to secure the core, while his astromech made his way to the command center to plant the false evidence.<ref name=\"DV2\" />\n\n[[File:Vader_turns_in_oon-ai.jpg|thumb|right|214px|Vader turns Oon-ai in.]]\nThey found themselves under the attack of two customized droidekas who brandished missile launchers, prompting Vader to use the Force to throw the incoming missiles back at the attackers, destroying the droids and fatally injuring the pirates. A [[Unidentified Mon Calamari pirate|Mon Calamari pirate]] survived long enough to activate the self-destruct, and Vader ordered the surviving troopers to return to the corvette and prepare to launch as soon as he returned. Followed by Oon-ai, Vader went deeper into the station to retrieve the false evidence. They returned to the corvette just before the station exploded.<ref name=\"DV2\" />\n\nBack on the ''Annihilator'', Vader reported to Tagge, telling him that he was impressed with the results of his plan (the intelligence he had gathered confirmed the raiders were being backed by the Crymorah syndicate), but also claimed Oon-ai was the leak, noting that Tagge should be more careful of those who were close to him. Shortly after, Vader isolated the black astromech under the pretenses of a private discussion; the Dark Lord ensured the droid had deleted all records of its data uploads on the station, before venting the droid through an airlock and into space, where it exploded.<ref name=\"DV2\" />\n\nFollowing a [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|Imperial-Rebel confrontation]], Vader went to the [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|Palace]] of [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus the Hutt]] to meet with Sergeant Kreel. A covert operative of his battalion \"Vader's Fist,\" Kreel informed him that his mission to end Grakkus' operations was a success, but that the Yavin Rebel pilot had escaped them yet again.

As he wanted similarly effective units in the personal army he sought to build, Vader set out to find Aphra, conducting a manhunt for her in many locations, gathering information and killing the witnesses, until he finally learned of her [[Theft of the Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix|presence]] on [[Quarantine World III]] in [[Kallidahin Space]]. He landed there just as Aphra was arrested by [[Utani Xane]] and a squad of B2 super battle droids; although Xane warned him that he was violating treaties, Vader began destroying her droids and saved Aphra as she tumbled over a ledge.

The rogue archaeologist also introduced Vader to the [[Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix]] and estimated it would take hours to unlock the matrix's codes that were restricting it. It took Vader a few seconds to unlock it, which let Aphra install the [[personality matrix]] into a protocol droid's body right away. As the droid introduced himself as [[0-0-0]], she imprinted herself and Vader as his masters, and used him to wake up [[BT-1]], a [[BT-1 assassin droid|blastomech prototype]]. But as it was hostile towards his new masters, 0-0-0 shut it down before he could do any harm.<ref name=\"DV3\" />\n\nVader then let her know the reason he had sought her out was to secure his own private resources, ones only she could help him procure. Aphra (who had originally acquired the two droids for the [[Droid Gotra|Gotra]]) instead gave them to Vader after realizing Vader was probably going to be her employer for the foreseeable future. She asked what else he needed, and he answered that he wanted troops of unquestionable loyalty: battle droids. Aphra then suggested that they [[Secret mission to Geonosis|acquire]] an [[Karina's lair|unusual droid foundry]] on Geonosis,<ref name=\"DV3\" /> one in possession of Queen [[Karina]], who had survived the Clone Wars and the [[Sterilization of Geonosis|planet's sterilization]]. As they landed the ''Ark Angel'', and she sent 0-0-0 and BT-1 to map the cave route to the queen so that she and Vader could follow, Aphra asked Vader if he had ever been to Geonosis before. Her questioning brought up the memory of his first kiss with Amidala,<ref name=\"DV4\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 4|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 4]]</ref> shortly before the First Battle of Geonosis.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Vader_slices_the_queen.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Vader cuts the Queen from her womb factory.]]\nVader ordered Aphra to cease her probing, and entered the catacombs; she followed him.

The queen, injured but alive, ordered her [[Droid worker|\"children\"]] to stop the intruders; at Vader's command, BT-1 opened fire on the droids, and he and Vader began to overwhelm her forces. Meanwhile, Aphra set a beacon on the ceiling with Vader's help and ordered her ''Ark Angel'' to barrage the locator to make a hole in the roof. Vader protected himself and Aphra by creating a [[Force barrier]]. His J-Type 327 Nubian then lowered a crane-platform, which Aphra attached to the factory while Vader fought off the advancing droids, and the ship carried them and the factory to the skies.<ref name=\"DV4\" />\n\nThey would later board the ''Ark Angel'', where Aphra successfully activated the factory and told him he would have his private droid army. She then asked Vader if he would kill her then or later, and said that if he did, she wanted a lightsaber right through the neck, with no warning. Vader finally told her she had proved resourceful and would be safe as long as he had use for her, unless she tried to blackmail him.

After learning this, they immediately departed for the base,<ref name=\"DV4\" /> aboard his [[J-type 327 Nubian starship|J-type 327 Nubian]]. While Aphra remained on the ship, Vader and two platoons of droid commandos [[Skirmish in Cylo's research base|infiltrated]] it. Vader sent a platoon to \"the dojo\" and had the other one follow him to the [[barracks]]. As they killed the soldiers in there, Aphra reported that they had lost the other platoon, prompting Vader to go to the dojo, where he met the twins [[Morit Astarte|Morit]] and [[Aiolin Astarte]].<ref name=\"DV5\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 5|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 5]]</ref>\n\nThey soon engaged in combat, but before any of the parties could harm each other, Cylo-V appeared and told the twins to stand down. He explained to Vader why he was still alive after his last body was killed, and that he was not making apprentices for the Emperor but enforcers, as he believed the Force to be obsolete. Believing him to be blasphemous, Vader attempted to strike Cylo down when the scientist claimed they were, in many ways, Vader's children and successors. The Emperor then revealed his presence to Vader and stopped him, claiming he wanted to see Cylo's demonstration without delay.<ref name=\"DV5\" />\n\nVader was immediately made to fight the Astarte twins, [[Tulon Voidgazer]], the Mon Calamari [[Karbin]], and a Trandoshan. As neither party was injured, the Emperor ordered the fight to be one to the death. As such, Vader fought the [[Trandoshan]], but its ferocity threw him off balance, prompting Morit to intervene and kill his fellow enforcer. The Emperor then ordered the fighting to cease; Vader warned Morit that his trespass would not be forgotten, as the Trandoshan's life was his to take. The Emperor then told the enforcers and Vader that their mission was to strike down all who opposed the Empire and that they were not to slay each other. As per his master's orders, Vader followed him.<ref name=\"DV6\" />\n\n[[File:Vader_be_like_yall_are_weak.jpg|thumb|right|247px|Vader stares down Cylo's enforcers as he follows his master.]]\nIn private, the Emperor (aware of Vader's private forces) admitted to being impressed that he had some independence left in him after so long and that perhaps he could triumph against the enforcers. Vader criticized his dealings with Cylo, as he saw his enforcers as a heresy to the Force, but the Emperor berated him for his lack of respect\u2014for it was Vader who had disappointed him on Mustafar and had forced him to contact Cylo. As he left, he observed that perhaps, Vader would prove himself worthy of the name he had given him back then.<ref name=\"DV6\" />\n\n====Parenthood====\n{{Quote|Did you bring me anything of value, bounty hunter?''\"<br />\"''Not much.

Aboard the Nubian, Aphra told him that Fett wanted to report in during Vader's absence. Subsequently, Vader traveled to a Star Destroyer to meet with the bounty hunter and hear his story. The Dark Lord was disappointed to hear that Fett had [[Duel in Ben Kenobi's home|lost]] the boy, but before leaving, Fett told him his name: Luke Skywalker. In his solitude, Vader remembered Amidala telling him about her pregnancy, and Palpatine's half-truth, and cracked the [[viewport]] in his anger. Thereupon, he used his meditation chamber's holoprojector to contact his master, but chose to say nothing about his son; rather, Vader assured him that he would not fail and ended the transmission. Nevertheless, he accepted Luke as his son and vowed that the boy would be his.<ref name=\"DV6\" />\n\nDetermined to find more about Luke, Vader returned to Tatooine on the ''Ark Angel'', with Aphra, 0-0-0 and BT-1 in his company. They landed at the Lars homestead, which they discovered to be deserted after an attack by Imperial troops, and Vader tried to find traces of Luke's presence. Unable to find anything of import, Vader left the [[moisture farm]] and went to [[Ben Kenobi's home|Kenobi's home]] where he indeed felt the remnants of Luke's usage of the Force during his duel against Fett, but nothing else. As they left, Aphra activated a [[molecular purge bomb]] to remove all remnants of their presence, and Vader dismissed Aphra, for he was to return to his duties for the time being.<ref name=\"DV7\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 7]]</ref>\n\n====Anthan Prime====\n{{Quote|I'm trying to ascertain if you are... dangerous.''\"<br />\"''Oh, I am, Lord Vader...

He and his troops destroyed the Pride's base and seized its stockpile of credits, to be transported on an Imperial light cruiser, but he also secretly sent Aphra all the information needed to steal the credits cargo.<ref name=\"DV7\" /> Following the [[Son-tuul Pride robbery|theft]], Vader reunited with her on [[Anthan 13]], where he sent her to confirm some information about [[Commodex Tahn]].<ref name=\"DV8\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 8|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 8]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Doowan_interrogated.png|thumb|right|288px|Vader, working alongside Inspector Thanoth]]\nVader then attended a meeting between Tagge and Cylo's enforcers, wherein the Astarte twins were assigned to deal with the [[Plasma Devils]], and wherein Vader let Tagge know he wanted the mission of finding the Yavin Rebel pilot (which was Karbin's mission). Tagge felt he was too personally invested, and sent Vader to punish whoever was responsible for the theft of the Son-tuul Pride's fortune in the [[Anthan system]]; he also informed Vader that Inspector [[Thanoth]] was his replacement adjutant.<ref name=\"DV8\" /> While Thanoth went to the [[Anthan Prime Orbital Dockyard]] to [[Mission to the Anthan system|investigate]] the theft's circumstances, Vader returned to Anthan 13 and killed the entirety of a small Rebel cell to cover his tracks. He later reunited with Thanoth on [[Anthan Prime]], where they sought [[Doowan]], an employee of \"[[the Dragon]]\"\u2014an arms dealer who was likely to have sold the explosives needed for the theft\u2014and interrogated him. The [[Nautolan]] promptly revealed the location of the Dragon in [[The Dragon's mansion|his mansion]], before the twins killed him in a show of force.<ref name=\"DV9\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 9|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 9]]</ref>\n\nThanoth then noticed Vader's passivity, but Vader dismissed it, saying he was merely trying to ascertain if Thanoth was dangerous or a traitor.<ref name=\"DV9\" /> The two then went to the Dragon's mansion, which Vader entered on his own, killing the people inside until he reached the Dragon himself. Although he tried to tell Vader everything to save himself, Vader killed the [[Ortolan]], and claimed he would have detonated the building once Thanoth reached the office. The inspector then opened the Dragon's vault to access his records and asked Vader to ready a strike force for when he located the suspects.<ref name=\"DV10\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 10]]</ref>\n\nVader then used the opportunity to meet with Aphra, who had just come back from a [[Assault on Commodex Tahn's villa|raid]] on Commodex Tahn's villa on Naboo. She confirmed his sources: Amidala had indeed died but had given birth to a healthy boy, who was taken away by the Jedi. Vader then tasked Aphra with finding Luke before Karbin could; subsequently, she resorted to [[The Ante]].<ref name=\"DV10\" /> Vader then returned to the Star Destroyer, where Thanoth they would travel to the [[Anthan Spire|Spire]] to find The Ante. When they found him, he told them the location of the Plasma Devils to show cooperation and pointed at the one responsible for the theft, Aphra. Before the [[Givin]] could identify her by name, Vader telekinetically forced an unlucky stray shot and killed him.

Vader released her and ordered Aphra to tell him, but she refused, claiming she would tell him later. He then let her go, using the Force to drop debris above him as she escaped on the ''Ark Angel''. He got out of the rubble as Thanoth and the stormtroopers arrived and claimed he had fallen into her trap. To follow her,<ref name=\"DV11\" /> Vader and Thanoth boarded their ''Arquitens''-class light cruiser. As they waited for their [[TIE/sa bomber]]s to catch Aphra, Vader and Thanoth agreed to use their ready strike force to kill the Plasma Devils before they could escape.<ref name=\"DV12\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 12]]</ref>\n\nThe two had their [[light cruiser]] go to the [[Thanteen Substrata]] on [[Anthan 1]], where the Rebel cell was located. As per their plan, their light cruiser bombarded the westernmost tunnels and sealed them, whereas Vader went to the east route and felled incoming Rebel ships by throwing his lightsaber until the cell was annihilated. He then took three of the Plasma Devils' [[flight helmet]]s and, alongside Thanoth, presented them to Tagge, who agreed with their course of action given the tight situation. As Karbin reported that the Yavin Rebel pilot was free, Vader and Thanoth left, and the Inspector let him know it had been an honor to serve alongside him.<ref name=\"DV12\" />\n\n====Shu-Torun====\n{{Quote|As a princess, you served your father.

Expecting to meet the [[Unidentified King of Shu-Torun|King of Shu-Torun]], he instead met Princess [[Trios]] upon landing, who was to show him to the ball, a little celebration to showcase their culture. Soon after their arrival, however, Shu-Torun assassins that wished death to the Empire and the king, but Vader successfully fended them off and demanded to see the king immediately. Trios complied and guided him through the tunnels as the main elevators were being watched by the traitorous dukes, according to her. Vader recognized Trios as admirable for her willingness to sacrifice herself for the greater good, as lava poured into the tunnels.<ref name=\"DV Annual 1\">[[Darth Vader Annual 1|''Darth Vader Annual'' 1]]</ref>\n\nHowever, he used his lightsaber to make a round platform to float above the lava and reach one of the exits above. Taking an unconscious Trios with him, Vader made it to one of the corridors where he killed the guards. Trios awoke, only to point a blaster at Vader. He, however, cut her hand off and entered the king's chambers to find the monarch, his other children and guards killed by Vader's assassin droids. With Trios as the new Queen of Shu-Torun, he delivered the Emperor's message; a piece of Alderaan, as a reminder of what happened to worlds that resisted his rule.

She continued by saying she did want to work for him and show that she was trustworthy. After a moment, he conceded that his work alongside Thanoth had given him an appreciation of talent, and told her not to make him regret his decision. He left, saying it was a task for him alone. Unbeknownst to him, a probe droid from Karbin followed him.<ref name=\"DV12\" /> In his TIE Advanced, he went to the planet's system where, upon coming out of hyperspace, he found three [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps|Alliance starfighter squadrons]] orbiting the planet. As he sensed Luke's presence, he remained and charged against the starfighters, who dismissed his TIE as a mere Imperial scout.<ref name=\"SW:VD\">[[Vader Down 1|''Vader Down'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Fear_and_Dead_Men_AtG.png|thumb|left|202px|Vader engaging Alliance forces on Vrogas Vas]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|battle]], Vader engaged the [[X-wing starfighter]]s, and managed to take out both [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]] and [[Yellow Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Yellow Squadron]], as he lost contact with Aphra. Vader was then confronted by Luke, who was flying as [[Red Five]], and flew his X-wing into Vader's starfighter, hoping to kill him. During the collision, their [[stabilizer]]s were damaged prompting their craft to crash on the planet's surface. There, Vader was hunted down by the Alliance forces, starting with [[Gray Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gray Squadron]], but he promptly destroyed them by use of the Force.<ref name=\"SW:VD\" /> Afterward, a [[company]] of Rebel [[commando]]s moved in to attack him, but he activated some of their thermal detonators before they could throw them, taking out a tank by deflecting its shot against it and continued to reduce the Rebel forces.<ref name=\"DV13\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref>\n\nVader also took the blaster array of his fallen TIE Advanced x1 and used it to take down further ships, this time from [[Cyan Squadron]]. Not too long afterward, another platoon was deployed to attack him, although this time Organa was leading them herself. Vader, choking her two companions, confronted her<ref name=\"SW13\">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref> but felt an incoming ambush. When he let her go so that she contacted Luke, Organa used the opportunity to arrange an airstrike on her and Vader's location. Instead, Commander Karbin arrived<ref name=\"DV14\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref> with a task force, and tried to take his victory\u2014both his son and the princess' execution\u2014from Vader. Subsequently, Vader engaged the enforcer in a duel, during which Organa escaped, and during which they entered the [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi Temple]] in ruins.<ref name=\"SW14\">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref>\n\nInside the temple, he was momentarily distracted by ghosts of his past (Jinn's, Kenobi's and Yoda's voices),<ref name=\"SW14\" /> but continued the duel. Aphra then contacted him from aboard the ''Ark Angel'' and informed him that Luke had been captured by Karbin's guards. So Vader had her crash her ship against Karbin and confronted the mortally wounded Karbin, who realized there was more to the Yavin pilot and Vader's relationship than met the eye. Vader then finished him and contacted Aphra to tell her that her \"pardon\" depended on Luke's capture. With the Force, he brought down the shuttle transporting Luke, and Aphra tried to capture Luke only to be captured herself by the Rebels, leaving Vader to watch as his son on the ''Millennium Falcon'' fled from Vrogas Vas.<ref name=\"DV15\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 15|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>\n\n====Shu-Torun War====\n{{Quote|The queen of Shu-Torun.

The Emperor then told Vader to return to Shu-Torun as the [[Ore-duke|ore-barons]] were [[War on Shu-Torun|rebelling]] and he required a full military intervention, and that Cylo (per Tagge's request) was to join him in the task. As a result, Vader returned to Shu-Torun, alongside Cylo, the Astarte twins and Voidgazer. Accompanied by Queen Trios, Vader led an attack against a rebellious [[Unidentified delving citadel|delving citadel]], and destroyed it as a demonstration of force. He also accorded to treat Trios with the illusion of respect and tasked, in secret, a group of bounty hunters to find Aphra and return her to him, either dead or alive.<ref name=\"DV16\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 16|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 16]]</ref>\n\nAfter sending a broadcast to the barons, Vader, Trios, and Cylo and his enforcers went, per the queen's suggestion, to the ancestral retreat of the Shu-Torun royalty. There, they were soon attacked by [[Baron]] [[Rubix]]'s ''[[Lava Leviathan]]'', and Vader used Trios' escape vessel to reach the Leviathan and dared the twins to follow him. With their lightsabers, they boarded it, and from the inside, the three cut large holes that allowed the ship to flood with magma and be destroyed. Upon returning, Trios suggested that they attack Rubix next (as she had identified the ship's owner) and so, Vader told Cylo to prepare his enforcers. In the meantime, he killed [[Beebox]] for trying to deceive him with a stranger's disintegrated body, and refused Aiolin's request to train her.<ref name=\"DV17\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 17|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 17]]</ref>\n\nSoon enough, they carried out the siege to [[Rubix's delving citadel]], using the [[Shu-Torun Loyalist/Imperial Delving Fleet]]'s [[combat drill]]s, with Vader heading the first wave alongside the Astarte. Hwever, he was betrayed by Cylo, and his drill was redirected into a [[lithoporoite]] seam, where they were surrounded by Rubix's elite forces. With their outbound communications jammed, Vader left his troops as well as droid platoons to protect the drill and had the Astarte twins follow him as to use the enemy's lines to tell the rest of the assault fleet to resume the attack. On the way there, the twins attacked him,<ref name=\"DV18\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 18|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 18]]</ref> but Aiolin saw they could not win against Vader and destroyed the pathway between them. She was then betrayed by her brother who pushed her into the lava and fled back to Cylo; Vader then took the dying Aiolin out of the lava and had her reveal Cylo's deceit before finishing her off.<ref name=\"DV19\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 19|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 19]]</ref>\n\nVader then returned to his forces, who had secured the enemy lines thanks to 0-0-0's stratagem, and was surprised to find that Trios' assault to the [[delving citadel]] was already underway. With no opposition, Vader's combat drill resumed his way to citadel, and Vader himself cut off Rubix's escape way. Trios soon went to their encounter and Rubix formally surrendered; she then had the baron executed, and appointed [[Bixene|his daughter]] as his successor, thus ending the rebellion. Vader then left the planet and informed the Emperor of Cylo's treachery, and the Emperor simply summoned him. He also received a message from Inspector Thanoth saying that he had located Aphra and that they needed to talk.<ref name=\"DV19\" />\n\n====Hunt for Cylo====\n{{Quote|I often wondered whether what rose from our operating table was a machine or a man...

The Emperor explained that in order to save Vader after Mustafar, he had to resort to scientists who were similar in philosophy to the Sith, among them Cylo. Cylo eventually grew too powerful within the Tarkin Initiative and so Sidious was forced to make him overplay his hand. Now that he was a mere traitor, he could be purged. After the meeting, Vader met with Thanoth on Anthan 13; the Inspector, now aware of Vader's real identity, revealed that he would support Vader's treason against the Emperor and that he would reveal Aphra's location on the [[Cosmatanic Steppes]]. However, when he did so, Vader killed him and ordered the droids to return Aphra to the ''Executor''.<ref name=\"DV20\" /> Later, he spoke with [[Professor]] [[Thlu-Ry]], a colleague of Cylo's. Thlu-Ry revealed Cylo's location in the [[Crushank Nebulae]], after which he was executed for fraternizing with a traitor.<ref name=\"DV21\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 21|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 21]]</ref>\n\nWith the ''Devastator'', Vader approached Cylo's flagship in his TIE Advanced x1 and boarded the enemy ship just before it jumped to hyperspace. As he made his way through the labs, Voidgazer confronted him and pitted him against a cyberanimate [[rancor]],<ref name=\"DV21\" /> just as Cylo's fleet arrived at Kuat. Although the creature gave him some difficulty, Vader killed it by throwing his lightsaber through its skull, severing the neural link, and turned one of Voidgazer's defense droids against her, fatally wounding her. As she lay dying, Voidgazer revealed that she had tampered with the ''Executor''{{'s}} systems to incapacitate the crew; Vader finished her off and went to the empty bridge, which had been abandoned by Cylo and Morit as they had fled in the escape pods, to find that Cylo's flagship was to collide with the ''Executor''.<ref name=\"DV22\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 22|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 22]]</ref> Before it did, he ejected and landed on the ''Executor''{{'s}} outer hull, where he soon encountered Morit.

The scientist simply disabled Vader's cybernetics with a device he had kept for twenty years, forcing Vader to kneel and drop his lightsaber.<ref name=\"DV23\" />\n\nWhile Vader was incapacitated, he received visions of his duel with his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. This time, however, Kenobi threw him into the lava. Vader then rose out of the river in his life suit and struck down his old master. However, like their duel on the Death Star, Kenobi's body disappeared. Vader then encountered a vision of his younger self. The two versions of Skywalker fought until Vader came out victorious, throwing his counterpart in the lava. After his counterpart yelled that he hated him, the Dark Lord met a vision of his deceased wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Vader then found himself chained to the same table where he first received his suit. The vision of Padm\u00e9 pleaded with him, asking him to stay with her. Vader, however, choked the illusion while at the same time regained control of his body. After he told the vision that her husband was dead, Vader used his lightsaber to impale Cylo, who was astounded that Vader was moving while his suit was deactivated. Thus, Vader had regained the ship from his control. The Dark Lord then informed his master of his success. The Emperor then ordered Vader to finish his mission then return to him, stating there was much to discuss.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 24\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 24|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 24]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tagge's_death.jpg|thumb|right|281px|Vader executes Tagge]]\nVader took control of his TIE Advanced, flying into Cylo's command ship. After cutting his way through Cylo's forces, the Dark Lord found his way to the doctor's cloning room. After destroying Cylo's spare bodies, Vader made it to the command bridge. Vader then confronted the doctor one last time. He mind-tricked the [[whale-ship]] into flying into a nearby star, destroying Cylo once and for all. After returning to the ''Executor'', Vader met with his master. The Emperor was initially expecting his apprentice to give him a full report, but it was revealed that Dr. Aphra told Palpatine all of Vader's secret missions and plans. Instead of being angry with Vader, however, the Emperor was pleased with his apprentice's ability to operate in the shadows, stating he was everything he could have hoped for. The Emperor then left his apprentice to deal with Aphra as he pleased.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 25\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 25|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 25]]</ref>\n\nVader then ordered Aphra to follow him. Though she revealed she had not told Palpatine about Luke Skywalker and despite her pleas for a quick death, he forced her out the airlock, although she secretly survived. Making his way to the bridge, the Emperor informed him that Grand General Tagge was to be demoted and that command of the ''Executor'' and its [[Death Squadron|fleet]] would be transferred to the Dark Lord. The Emperor then left his apprentice to \"educate\" his subordinates of this new era. Vader then executed Tagge and ordered Admiral [[Kendal Ozzel]] to have the ship ready in two weeks. Vader then thought of his son, content that he would soon have him.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 25\" />\n\n====Slaying the unworthy====\nAfter the rebellion began [[Mid Rim Retreat|encroaching]] in the Mid Rim, The Emperor let Vader loose, deciding that incompetence at the highest level was to blame for the the Death Star's destruction, allowing him to kill Imperial officials including Moff [[Coovern]] and Minister [[Khemt]].<ref name=\"TC\">''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]''</ref>\n\n====Skirmish on the Scorca Retreat====\n{{Quote|I am the alpha and the omega of the Ordu Aspectu!

Vader ordered his troopers to kill all of the individuals they found in the space station.<ref name=\"Aphra 12\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 12|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 12]]</ref>\n\nAs some of the stormtroopers crossed paths with the droid being controlled by Rur, Vader cut down a [[Ezaraa|member]] of the [[Dominion of the Ezaraa]]. Some of his stormtroopers approached him, reporting resistance in the top dome and the droid. Vader walked down the halls and found the droid standing over a pile of dead stormtroopers. The droid had two blue lightsabers, generated from the kyber crystal inside it, erected from its arms. The two declared themselves to each other and clashed.<ref name=\"Aphra 12\" /> As they fought, Vader deduced that Rur was not a Sith. Rur claimed to be the last of the Ordu Aspectu and a Jedi. As they deduced more about each other, Vader Force-pushed Rur into a stone slab. Rur got up again, but Vader charged at him, and as they clashed, he cut the droid's right hand off.<ref name=\"Aphra 13\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 13|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 13]]</ref>\n\nVader Force-pushed him again into a wall, and he began laughing. He said that while his former organic body had limited him, he was now boundless, a god of machines. Rur therefore took control of the defensive guns in the ceiling and used them on Vader. Rur then tried to take control of Vader's suit and stalled his defensive moves. Vader told him that he wasn't the first to attempt that and used the Force to repeatedly smash Rur against the walls. The three collisions with the walls demolished the droid and Vader took the crystal. After the duel, a stormtrooper reported to Vader that some small ships had slipped his blockade. Vader told the trooper that the blockade was to remain. Vader took the crystal back to Sidious on Coruscant and then archived it with the rest of his master's collection.<ref name=\"Aphra 13\" />\n\n====Tureen VII====\n[[File:Blockade_of_Tureen_VII_battle.jpg|thumb|left|251px|The siege on Tureen VII]]\nAfter the death of Cylo, Vader ordered Sergeant Kreel and his [[Task Force 99|SCAR Squadron]] to hunt down Luke Skywalker. They eventually found him and his allies [[Hijacking of the Harbinger|hijacking]] the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|''Harbinger'']]. The vessel made its way to the blockaded planet [[Tureen VII]] in an attempt to aid the people there. Vader and his TIE forces engaged the attacking rebel X-wings.<ref name=\"SW24\">[[Star Wars (2015) 24|''Star Wars'' (2015) 24]]</ref>\n\nWhile fighting the rebel fighters, Vader questioned Kreel if he had located Luke. At that moment, Kreel was engaging the rebel in a lightsaber duel. The Dark Lord then warned the stormtrooper not to injure his \"prize.\" However, Luke used the Force to incapacitate Kreel, much to Vader's anger. The rebels eventually were able to break the siege and give relief to the people of Tureen VII. SCAR Squadron, however, was not left empty-handed, capturing the protocol droid C-3PO.<ref name=\"SW25\">[[Star Wars (2015) 25|''Star Wars'' (2015) 25]]</ref>\n\nSoon after, Vader was contacted by Kreel and informed that C-3PO had told them everything they needed to know and that they couldn't get him to shut up. Vader then told him that the droid was a piece of worthless junk and to dispose of him.<ref name=\"SW26\">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref>\n\nShortly after, R2-D2 managed to infiltrate the Star Destroyer where C-3PO was held and broke the droid out. Vader was notified of this and intercepted their X-wing in his TIE advanced. R2-D2 knew they couldn't escape alone and sent out a distress call to their friends. To Vader's frustration, R2-D2 gained the support of Luke, the ''Millennium Falcon'' and the ''[[Volt Cobra]]'', who gave enough covering fire to help them all escape.<ref name=\"SW 36\">[[Star Wars (2015) 36|''Star Wars'' (2015) 36]]</ref>\n\n====Confronting Kreel====\nSometime later, Vader approached Kreel, who was training with half a dozen [[training droid]]s. Vader told him he could try all he wanted but he would never become a Sith. Kreel said he wasn't asking to be, saying that it wasn't a Sith who saved him from the pits of [[Chagar IX]], but the 501st Legion. Claimed to be a stormtrooper to the core and that he was just appreciating the value of a lightsaber. Vader then took his lightsaber and threatened to get rid of him and his squad for failing him aboard the ''Harbinger''. Kreel told Vader that if he failed him again, he would kneel down to Vader and bury that lightsaber in his chest himself, after killing his men with it. Vader gave Kreel a mission to destroy a possible rebel outpost on [[Horox III]], bringing back Luke if he was present. Vader then handed back Kreel's lightsaber and told him to be worthy of it. Sidious then entered the room and summoned Vader. Kreel knelt down and in honor of Sidious's presence and he thanked him. Sidious then brought Vader out of the room. Kreel then [[Mission to Horox III|traveled]] to the [[Horox system]] and destroyed the [[Horox III rebel outpost|rebel outpost]] there, killing all rebels present.<ref name=\"SW 37\">[[Star Wars (2015) 37|''Star Wars'' (2015) 37]]</ref>\n\n====Sculpting a trap====\n[[File:Ozzel_Veers_Darth_Vader_meeting_Star_Wars_50.png|thumb|right|241px|Vader talks with Kendal Ozzel and Maximillian Veers.]]\nSometime later, Vader was at his castle with Admiral Kendal Ozzel and General [[Maximilian Veers]]. There, he asked Ozzel of the excuses he had for the slowing progress of Imperial projects. Ozzel blamed the growing resistance which although he could strike back, they were too spread out. Ozzel suggested that scrounging more worlds with constant bombardments of planets from Vader's new Death Squadron. Veers intervened at that point and came up with a theory. Veers claimed that the rebellion was like weeds, and the Empire was like a storm. Veers further pointed out that when a storm passes, weeds will bend and come out unharmed. He then said that it would be different if the rebellion was a tree. But Veers stated that until then, the rebellion would slip through their fingers. This triggered a memory in Vader of when Leia Organa told Tarkin: \"The more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\" Vader told his subordinates that Veers made an interesting point and concluded that it was what they should do.<ref name=\"Shu-Torun Lives\">{{Shortstory|story=Shu-Torun Lives|book=Star Wars (2015) 50|bformatted=''Star Wars'' 50|manual=1}}</ref>\n\nVader traveled to Shu-Torun and approached Queen Trios in her meeting room. She was surprised at his arrival and assumed it was not on good terms. She pleaded that she had done nothing against him and that she had been a loyal servant. She then told her guards to lower their weapons. Trios asked Vader how she could help him. Vader revealed his plan for her specialists to mine the ruins of Jedha. After she was to supply information to the rebels that would be sufficient to entirely sabotage the mining efforts. Finally, she had to infiltrate the rebellion, which was trying to build a fleet, and do everything she could to help them. Vader said to her that when they had built their armada, and before they hid it, he would show them how weak they truly were. Vader then threatened her that he'd make Alderaan look like a dream to Shu-Torun if she tried anything. A Shu-Torun guard stepped forward and told Vader that he could not threaten Trios like that. Trios shot him as Vader was their honored guest. She then allowed Vader to kill the rest of the people in the room.<ref name=\"Shu-Torun Lives\" />\n\n====Vader's ambush====\n[[File:SW_50_Hope_Dies_Vader.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Vader oversees the attack on the Mako-Ta spacedocks]]\nTo Vader's pleasure, Trios was successful in her mission, being able to earn Leia Organa's trust at Jedha and helping them prompt a [[Mutiny on Mon Cala|mass mutiny]] of Mon Calamari merchant ships. As the rebels armed their new cruisers at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]], she gave Vader the go-ahead to attack, telling him that they expected nothing.<ref name=\"MoM6\">[[Star Wars (2015) 49|''Star Wars'' (2015) 49]]</ref> As the rebels prepared to scatter their new fleet, their hyperdrives failed to work, rendering the cruisers immobile from the system. Vader arrived soon after with Death Squadron and Ozzel asked Vader if they should begin a bombardment. Vader told him to wait, saying he sensed their fear and that it was insufficient. He told Ozzel to give them time to understand. As the rebel fighters prepared to deploy, they realized that not only were the hanger doors not opening, but neither were the defense turrets able to fire or were their engines able to activate. This was because Organa had ensured that the cruisers were outfitted with Shu-Torun technology, meaning Trios could sabotage them. The cruisers were useless against Vader's fleet, and Vader ordered the nearest cruiser be destroyed. The fleet subsequently fired on General [[Vanden Willard]]'s flagship ''[[Yavin's Hope]]'' and destroyed it with ease, killing Willard. Ozzel then asked Vader of their next target, and Vader said hope.<ref name=\"SW 50\">[[Star Wars (2015) 50|''Star Wars'' (2015) 50]]</ref>\n\nThe Star Destroyers began engaging the other Mon Calamari cruisers, and Trios attempted to get off the spacedocks on her ship. However, rebel forces boarded the vessel, and she was forced to escape in an escape pod. The rebels discovered they could get the cruiser's hangar doors to open by flying a ship towards it. [[Bandwin Cor]] volunteered to do so and flew a shuttle towards the cruisers. The shuttle was reported to Vader, but the TIE fighters dealt with it before Vader could make any decisions. Vader's fleet soon destroyed another cruiser, sending it into a fireball. The ''Millennium Falcon'' then arrived at the system, and Han Solo was told to attempt the same thing by Organa. Vader was notified of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} arrival and quickly went to his TIE advanced. Solo flew the ''Falcon'' through the fleet and took on TIEs before flying towards General [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Republic (MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser)|''Republic'']]. Vader then engaged the ''Falcon'' and hit the ship's stabilizer, sending it spiraling. Solo set it to manual, and Vader prepared to fire on the ''Falcon'' when it got back on course.<ref name=\"SW 51\">[[Star Wars (2015) 51|''Star Wars'' (2015) 51]]</ref>\n\nVader fired missiles at the ''Falcon'' as Solo attempted to land on Commander [[Lajaie]]'s [[Lajaie's cruiser|cruiser]]. Vader was to force Lajaie's crew to abandon ship and ordered the ''Executor'' to destroy the escape pods. He continued to pursue the ''Falcon'' until his TIE was disabled temporarily in a nearby asteroid field.<ref name=\"Star Wars 52\">[[Star Wars (2015) 52|''Star Wars'' (2015) 52]]</ref> Vader was able to resume his attack on the rebel fleet's starfighters. Vader then ordered the Imperial fleet to close in on the Rebel fleet. After being informed that Trios was returning to the ''Executor'', Vader returned to the ship where he intended to meet her. However, he learned that rebels had boarded the ''Executor'' by using Trios' shuttle.<ref name=\"Star Wars 53\">[[Star Wars (2015) 53|''Star Wars'' (2015) 53]]</ref> He pursued the rebels until he found several led by General [[Davits Draven]] and killed all of them. However, their mission was just to slow Vader down and Vader Force choked Draven. Vader caught up with Organa but was unable to stop her from escaping the ''Executor'' via a TIE fighter. As one rebel cruiser left, Vader ordered the Imperial fleet to destroy the remaining rebel vessels.<ref name=\"Star Wars 54\">[[Star Wars (2015) 54|''Star Wars'' (2015) 54]]</ref>\n\nVader continued to oversee the destruction of the remaining rebel ships. Despite the return of a rebel cruiser, Vader pushed the attack. The rebels capital ships were eventually able to retreat and disperse in order to reorganize. Vader informed the Emperor of the rebels' defeat and assured him that the Rebels could never win.<ref name=\"Star Wars 55\">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref>\n\n===Revealing the truth===\n====Hoth====\n{{Quote|Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of lightspeed and we are preparing to\u2014''\"<br />\"''You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.|Admiral Kendal Ozzel and Darth Vader|audio=YouHaveFailedMeForTheLastTimeAdmiral.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\nBy the time three years had passed after the Battle of Yavin, Vader was still in command of the ''Executor'', under the admiralty of Ozzel, as well as its accompanying fleet, Death Squadron.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> At Vader's request, [[Lieutenant Commander]] Ciena Ree was transferred from the ''Devastator'' to the ''Executor''; Ree believed, however, that Vader's request had been more threat than reward, as she remained forever vulnerable to him for seeing him during Yavin's immediate aftermath.<ref name=\"LS\" /> Obsessed with finding Luke, Vader dispatched thousands of [[Viper probe droid]]s<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> as [[Project Swarm]],<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra 37\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 37|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 37]]</ref> with the droids being sent into the far reaches of space in order to find his son.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Among the archaeological consultants of this was Doctor Aphra, whom Vader had brought back into service<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra 37\" /> after [[propaganda]] Minister [[Pitina Mar-Mas Voor]]'s failed [[plot to assassinate Emperor Palpatine]].<ref name=\"Aphra 36\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 36|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 36]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Vader-on-Hoth.jpg|thumb|right|243px|Vader arrives at Echo Base on Hoth.]]\nEventually, the ''Executor'' received a fragmented report from the [[XJ9-CS14|probe droid]] sent to the [[Hoth system]]. Although Admiral Ozzel dismissed the news as a false lead, both Vader and Captain [[Firmus Piett]] agreed that they had found the Rebel base. Vader then gave orders for the fleet to depart for the system. As the fleet came out of hyperspace near [[Hoth]], Vader was informed by General Veers that orbital bombardment was impossible as an energy shield defended [[Echo Base]]. Vader guessed from this information that the Alliance knew of their presence because Ozzel had made the fleet exit hyperspace too close to the system. After ordering Veers to prepare his troops for a ground assault, Vader executed Ozzel for his incompetence and promoted Captain Piett to replace him as Admiral, and had him deploy the fleet so that no Rebel ship escaped the system.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nAs the Imperial ground forces led by Veers [[Battle of Hoth|engaged]] the Alliance,Vader led an assault troop into the Rebel base and broke their lines, but they found it mostly deserted, for General [[Carlist Rieekan]] had ordered its evacuation pre-emptively.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Vader entered the base and soon ran into a group of Rebels carrying their unconscious captain towards a hangar. They open fire, and Vader deflected their shots before leaping and cutting down a Rebel trooper named [[Beak (individual)|Beak]]. Another trooper, named [[Roja]], threw a grenade at Vader, who used the Force to deflect it. It knocked out their sergeant, [[Hazram Namir]], and Roja was killed soon after. The last Rebel was the former Imperial governor of [[Haidoral Prime]], [[Everi Chalis]]. She had been pursued by Imperial forces in the weeks following her defection and assumed Vader was there for her. Vader only asked her where Luke was, and when a trooper told him that they had located the ''Millennium Falcon'', he pushed her aside and marched in the direction of his target.<ref name=\"TC\" />\n\nOnly the ''Millennium Falcon'' remained at the base's hangar, but the [[light freighter]] was able to escape before Vader could capture it. With the Alliance's forces on Hoth in complete retreat and the various transports scattered throughout the galaxy, Vader and his troops had secured a great victory for the Empire.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Rather than pursuing the Rebel transports which had gotten away,<ref name=\"LS\" /> Vader redirected his Death Squadron's efforts to capturing the ''Millennium Falcon'', which had evaded Imperial forces in the [[Hoth asteroid belt]] due to its faulty hyperdrive.

Vader contacted his master; the Emperor told him that he had sensed a new threat in the Force: Luke Skywalker, who he feared could destroy them if he ever became a Jedi, and that he was Anakin's son. Feigning shock at the Emperor's revelation, Vader believed Luke could be turned to the dark side and prove a powerful ally. Although the Emperor was doubtful, Vader assured him that Luke would join them or die.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nDetermined to find his son before the Emperor, Vader summoned several bounty hunters\u2014[[4-LOM]], Bossk, [[Zuckuss]], [[Dengar]], [[IG-88B|IG-88]], and Boba Fett\u2014to the ''Executor'', and promised a substantial [[Bounty|reward]] for the one who found the ''Falcon''{{'s}} crew alive. As he was briefing the [[Hunting|hunters]], Piett informed Vader that the ''[[Avenger]]'' was tracking the ''Falcon''. Vader requested an update from the ship's commander, Captain [[Lorth Needa]], who reported that he had lost the ''Falcon'' and assumed full responsibility for this.

Afterward, he inspected one of the city's [[carbon-freeze chamber]]s, and deemed it adequate if crude, to freeze Luke for his journey to the Emperor, but at the danger of it being fatal, he had the facility tested on Captain Solo.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nOn his orders, Solo was frozen in [[carbonite]]; as he survived, Vader handed Solo over to Fett and ordered Organa, Chewbacca and C-3PO taken to his ship, while he awaited Luke at the facility.

Vader then told Luke that Kenobi had hidden from him the truth about his father, Anakin Skywalker, before revealing that he was, in fact, his father. Luke refused to believe the truth, but Vader continued to tempt his weakened son, offering Luke the chance to destroy the Emperor and \"bring order to the galaxy,\" just as he tried to do with Padm\u00e9 on Mustafar. He even pleaded with his son to come with him, but Luke chose likely death by plunging into the shaft.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nWhile Luke was rescued by his friends on the ''Millennium Falcon'', Vader returned to the ''Executor''. As the freighter was unable to [[Escape from Cloud City|escape]] due to its disabled hyperdrive, Vader and Piett waited for the ''Falcon'' to enter tractor-beam range.

There, ZED-6-7 discovered that someone had planted a [[scout transmitter]]. The transmitter led to [[Vendaxa]]. But before journeying there, the Sith traveled to a [[cantina]] and confronted a [[Unidentified Luke Skywalker impostor|man]] who claimed to be his son Luke Skywalker.

Vader then killed the impostor and told the people who were about to hire him that he would let them live. That way, they would be witnesses for what the man had done. The Sith then stated that whoever claimed the name of Luke Skywalker would also claim the crimes he had committed against the Empire. After leaving the cantina, Vader admonished the Imperial officer who had given him the information on the alleged Luke Skywalker, telling him his information was worthless and that he had simply wasted his time.<ref>[[Star Wars (2020) 5|''Star Wars'' (2020) 5]]</ref>\n\nWhen Luke Skywalker met [[Verla]] on [[Serelia]], she told him about Order 66 and the Imperial Inquisitors, describing Vader as pure, true evil.

He ordered his pilot to set course for Tempes, but when he arrived there, he found nothing but the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor, who had recently been defeated by Luke Skywalker. When asked by the Grand Inquisitor if he would ever be freed from Vader's service, the Sith Lord refused to do so, saying that the Inquisitor was merely a tool for him.

As Vader flew past the creature, Moore warned him that it would break his mind. Ignoring the Umbaran's warning, he continued on until he and Ochi were both hit by mental attacks. Vader experienced several traumatic visions from his past, which concluded with a vision of his son killing him in battle and taking his place by the Emperor's side.<ref name=\"DV 2020 10\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 10]]</ref>\n\nUpon escaping the Red Nebula, Vader finally reached the planet Exegol, where he and Ochi promptly crashed. Breaking free from the wrecked interceptor, they were both met once again by the creature. But this time, however, Vader did not run away. Disobeying his master's command, he reached out with the dark side and used it to bring the creature down, thus allowing him and Ochi to continue on towards the Emperor's [[Sith Citadel]].<ref name=\"DV 2020 10\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 10]]</ref> Standing atop the creature, Vader commanded his master to show himself. And once he did, Vader rode the creature into battle. In turn, the Emperor summoned two crustaceous monsters to attack the creature, though they were both quickly crushed. When Vader told his master that he was no longer his apprentice, the Emperor merely scoffed and reached out with the Force himself, twisting and contorting the creature until it broke apart. Forced to return to ground level, Vader followed the Emperor into the Citadel, where his greatest secrets lie in wait.<ref name=\"DV 2020 11\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 11]]</ref>\n\nOnce inside, Vader was greeted by a menagerie of horrors forged by his master. All around him were large vats containing [[Strand-Cast|bioengineered organisms]] strong in the dark side of the Force. Along with these organisms were large Sith statues, dozens of [[Exegol Sith guard|Sith guards]], [[Sith cultist]]s and a jar containing the severed hand of Vader's son. Vader was quickly attacked by the guards and cultists, but he managed to defeat them all before venturing further into the Citadel. Ochi caught up with Vader and attempted to dissuade him, but the Sith carried on until he reached a level beneath the Citadel. This level was lined with hundreds of Star Destroyers, each armed with a [[Axial superlaser|planet-destroying cannon]]. Showing no fear, Vader continued on into a massive chamber, which held a dome filled with red light and piercing screams. As Ochi tried to dissuade him once more, the Sith entered the dome and stepped into the burning light.<ref name=\"DV 2020 11\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 11]]</ref>\n\nWithin the dome was a subterranean mountain of Kyber crystal, bled red by the Sith cultists who kept it in constant pain. The Emperor explained that he did this in order to power the cannons of his fleet. When the crystal was cut, it screamed in pain again and sent out a wave of power, knocking off Ochi's helmet and burning his unprotected eyes. Vader suffered as well while his master mocked him for attempting to claim his power. The Emperor told his apprentice that if he chose to walk with him, he would never escape his pain. But only by walking with him would he be able to share his power. The Emperor then asked his apprentice if he had chosen, to which Darth Vader replied that Sidious was his master. Even though he experienced a vision, in which Luke Skywalker told him that he would, one day, kill the Emperor,<ref name=\"DV 2020 11\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 11]]</ref> Vader had seen the power Sidious commanded on Exegol, so he fully decided to return to his master's service,<ref name=\"DV 2020 12\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 12]]</ref> departing Exegol with Sidious, Ochi, Mas Amedda, and Sly Moore.<ref name=\"DV 2020 11\" />\n\n====Hunting Luke Skywalker====\n=====A new target=====\n{{Quote|You could still be strong, my son.

So ''this'' time&hellip;you will die.|Darth Vader|Darth Vader (2020) 12}}\nUpon returning to Coruscant, Vader was brought to the very building where he had been transformed to undergo repairs. A medical droid told him to prepare for shutdown, but Vader refused, choosing instead to remain conscious throughout the procedure. Once he was fully repaired, Vader asked the Emperor his will, to which his master told him to decide that for himself. Vader then called over Ochi, who had just been given a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic visor]] so he could continue to see. With Ochi at his side, Vader left Coruscant in a Lambda-class shuttle and decided that he would hunt down and kill his son, believing that there was no place for him as an apprentice after the power he had seen on Exegol. Traveling to a remote outpost somewhere in the Outer Rim, Vader and Ochi met with a Hutt named [[Bokku]]. When Ochi asked for the whereabouts of Han Solo, Bokku reported that he had been stolen and assured the assassin that Jabba would recover him. However, Ochi then told Bokku that he would recover Solo himself in exchange for power. Bokku then asked Ochi if he served the Emperor, to which Ochi replied that they both served Vader now.<ref name=\"DV 2020 12\" />\n\n=====Ambush at Zee-Nine City Seven=====\n{{Quote|You planned to betray me from the beginning.

Bokku quickly apologized for not recognizing Vader and reiterated that he didn't know where Solo was. From this, Ochi determined that Jabba had likely hired someone to find Solo and asked Bokku for their identity. Bokku expressed fear at the idea of betraying Jabba until Ochi pried into Bokku's willingness to take over the [[Grand Hutt Council]]. Bokku then revealed that he had been tracking the hunters who had taken Jabba's bounty and that one crew of droids had gone in a different direction from the others. Bokku told Vader the droids were deep in the heart of Hutt Space and that it would be better to go in Bokku's barge so as not to scare them away. On their way to the droids' location, Bokku inquired as to his compensation for his assistance, to which Vader assured him that he would be rewarded. Under the piloting of Bokku's [[nav droid]] [[Gak-Sixtoo]], they arrived at [[Zee-Nine City Seven]] while Vader and Ochi boarded their Lambda shuttle. But as they approached the city, their ship's engines were shut down, causing them to crash. After escaping the wreckage, Vader and Ochi were confronted by the Droid Crush Pirates, who expressed shock at Ochi's service to Vader. When Ochi claimed he had picked the winning side, the [[Unidentified droid pirate captain|droid captain]] told him he had picked wrong as IG-88 revealed himself and fired upon both Ochi and Vader.<ref name=\"DV 2020 13\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 13]]</ref>\n\nAs Vader deflected IG-88's attacks, the droid reminded his target that he had sustained damages while IG-88 himself had not. Vader informed the droid that he had information he required and commanded him to lay down his weapons, to which IG-88 replied that Vader would only access his information by downloading it from his severed head. Vader went to attack IG-88, but the droid then took out a remote and used it to slice into Vader's armor, taking control of the Sith Lord. As IG-88 forced Vader to hold his own saber to his head, Vader demanded to know who had given the droid the code to breach his armor. IG-88 responded that the terms of his employment prevented him from sharing that information. While the droid was distracted, Vader used the Force to take the device from him, allowing him to use it against his attacker. Vader then forced IG-88 to hold his own blaster to his head and pull the trigger, incapacitating him. Vader then continued his fight against the pirates until Bokku's barge fired upon him. Vader blocked the blasts with his lightsaber and redirected the energy at the pirates, knocking them back along with Ochi. As the pirates retreated, Vader took IG-88's hand and used it to access a terminal he had been using earlier. Upon activating the terminal, Vader and Ochi discovered various dead ends that the droid had been chasing, as well as the symbol of crime syndicate [[Crimson Dawn]]. After acquiring IG-88's information, Vader returned to Bokku's barge and confronted him over his betrayal. When Vader asked the Hutt what he had learned, Bokku conceded that the Sith Lord could not be defeated.<ref name=\"DV 2020 13\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 13]]</ref>\n\n=====Pursuing Crimson Dawn=====\n{{Quote|What you see is what you get with Ochi of Bestoon.

As Ochi prepared to sneak into a bar, Vader told him to walk in the front door instead. After a brief scuffle, Ochi retrieved an invitation sent out by the syndicate and showed it to Vader. He and Vader then returned to Bokku's lair to interrogate him over the invitation. The Hutt revealed that Crimson Dawn was holding an auction for Solo and that Jabba would repurchase him. However, Vader  told Bokku that he would bid against Jabba and lose. This would humiliate him and make Jabba lose all fear of him, allowing Bokku to betray him. Once Bokku agreed, Vader and Ochi returned to the Lambda-class shuttle and began to take off. But before they could leave the planet, Vader grabbed Ochi and dropped him from the ship. Once Ochi hit the ground, Vader ordered him to find out who else Bokku was working for. Later that night, Vader observed as Ochi was offered a place in Crimson Dawn by a group of assassins. However, Ochi rejected their offer and managed to eliminate them. Vader then approached Ochi, who quickly realized that Vader already knew that Bokku was working with Crimson Dawn. He had only wished to test the Ochi's loyalty. As more assassins surrounded them, Ochi reaffirmed he would always obey Vader as long as he remained the most powerful. Vader assured Ochi that he always would be as the two of them set about eliminating the assassins.<ref name=\"DV 2020 15\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 15|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 15]]</ref>\n\nAfter discovering that Sly Moore had hired IG-88, Vader and Ochi returned to Coruscant to find her, her court and the phlutdroid in one of the Temple gardens. As Vader struck down IG-88 once again, Moore and her court fled into the Imperial Palace. As they attempted to escape into the streets, Vader used the Force to close the door in front of them. However, Moore then took out another remote and used it to freeze Vader in his own armor, allowing her and her court to open fire on the Sith Lord. But this did not last as Vader overcame the Umbaran's control and struck down her entire court. Moore tried once more to take control of Vader, but Ochi revealed that Vader had fixed that vulnerability in his armor. Vader then knocked the remote out of Moore's hand and told her that she could not bend his will. Moore responded that she only wanted to see if Vader was still plagued by fear, to which Vader said that the only fear in that place was hers. Moore conceded that he could kill her effortlessly, but also pointed out that doing so would do nothing to save him from Luke Skywalker. When Vader asked the Umbaran what she knew of Skywalker, she stated that the key to finding him, his friend Han Solo was currently being sold by Crimson Dawn. She also pointed out that if she secured Solo for Vader, then the Emperor would not learn of his plans. When Ochi asked Moore why Vader should trust her, the Umbaran answered that she would be delighted to reunite Vader with the only person who could kill him, to which Vader agreed.<ref name=\"DV 2020 14\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 14]]</ref>\n\n=====Auction for Han Solo=====\n{{Quote|Who trained you?

However, this was merely a ruse to humiliate the Umbaran in the Emperor's eyes. Amidst the bidding, Vader himself arrived at the auction on [[Jekara]] along with a pair of death troopers. After cutting down a few Crimson Dawn guards, Vader infiltrated the [[Vermillion (Crimson Dawn)|''Vermillion'']]<ref name=\"DV 2020 14\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 14]]</ref> just as Crimson Dawn's leader, [[Lord|Lady]] [[Qi'ra]] sold Solo to Jabba the Hutt.<ref name=\"DA 2020 12\">[[Doctor Aphra (2020) 12|''Doctor Aphra'' (2020) 12]]</ref> Vader then declared that Solo belonged to him.<ref name=\"WOTBH 2\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 2|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 2]]</ref> But as he ordered the death troopers to transport Solo to his flagship, Jabba pointed out that he had already laid claim to the smuggler. Moore attemped to explain the situation, but Vader chastised her for her failure and warned her that the Emperor would hear of it. The Sith Lord then told Jabba that he and everyone else within the Empire belonged to the Emperor, to which Jabba feigned amusement. Vader went on to point out that the Empire could easily replace the Hutts, while also pointing out the fear he could sense in Jabba and the rest of the attending Hutts. When Bokku angrily interrupted, Vader asked Jabba who he was, to which Jabba said that he was no one. Jabba then finally conceded and allowed Solo to be taken with his compliments and regards to the Emperor.<ref name=\"WOTBH 3\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 3|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 3]]</ref>\n\nAs Vader approached Solo, Lady Qi'ra informed him that she would not get in his way, but also still required the one million credits she was promised. When Vader told her she was owed nothing, Qi'ra inquired if the Empire was too poor or cheap to pay its debts. Out of patience, Vader drew out his lightsaber, to which Qi'ra bared her own pair of blades. As they dueled, Vader recognized Qi'ra's fighting style and asked her who had trained her. Qi'ra replied that she had been trained by someone who knew quite a bit about both Vader and his master. Vader then pointed out that she did not have the Force and warned that her skill would not save her. After a brief struggle, Vader pushed Qi'ra back with the Force, knocking her into Solo. Stating she would pay the price for her foolishness, he raised his lightsaber and prepared to strike her down. But he was suddenly distracted the arrival of Luke Skywalker, whose presence he sensed through the Force.<ref name=\"WOTBH 3\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 3|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 3]]</ref> While Qi'ra retreated, Vader was informed by General Romodi that Piett had established a secure channel to Skywalker's starfighter. Accessing the channel, Vader told Skywalker he had Solo in his possession. He then warned his son that if he did not come to him, then he would cut his friend in half.<ref name=\"SW 16\">[[Star Wars (2020) 16|''Star Wars'' (2020) 16]]</ref> Skywalker refused however, telling Vader to come to him.

As Vader closed in on Skywalker, he was contacted by Sly Moore. When Vader stated that he did not require her assistance, Moore informed him that she was not helping him. Vader was then attacked by the Droid Crush Pirates, who landed on his ship and began to tear it apart. After causing some damage to the Sith's fighter, the pirates fell onto Skywalker's X-wing and quickly repaired it for him, allowing him to take off from the planet. As Vader continued his chase while fending off the pirates, he was informed by Ochi that the Hutts were going after the Imperial shuttle transporting Solo.<ref name=\"DV 2020 16\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 16|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 16]]</ref> \n\nVader was then contacted by Admiral Piett, who informed him of the Hutts' attack on the ''Executor''. However, Vader chastised Piett for disturbing him, claiming that the activities of the Hutts were irrelevant to him. He then warned Piett that if Solo was not aboard his flagship by the time he returned, he would require an explanation in person. Later in the fight, Piett contacted Vader again and told him that he had appraised the Emperor of the situation. Since the Emperor considered the Empire's arrangement with the Hutts to be valuable, he wished for it to be preserved by having Vader eliminate the Grand Hutt Council. Vader conceded to the Emperor's wishes and abandoned his pursuit of Skywalker, reminding his son that he was no Jedi. Though the boy then claimed that the next time they met, he would be. Vader then boarded the Hutt Council's ship and summarily slaughtered them all, including Bokku. Before his death, Bokku revealed his allegiance to Crimson Dawn and had Gak-Sixtoo blow up their own ship in an attempt to kill Vader, which the Sith survived.<ref name=\"DV 2020 17\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 17|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 17]]</ref> With the Hutt Council eliminated, the Hutts ceased their attack on the ''Executor'' while Fett reclaimed Solo from the Empire and delivered him to Jabba on Tatooine.<ref name=\"WOTBH 5\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 5|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 5]]</ref> Shortly afterwards, Vader was informed by Lieutenant [[Haydenn]] that Beilert Valance had infiltrated the ''Executor''.

When Moore pointed out that Skywalker was still free and could still fight, the Sith Lord choked her and stated that his hope would not be enough. Vader was then contacted by Darth Sidious, prompting him to release the Umbaran and kneel before him.

As the [[Battle of Endor|battle]] between the Imperial and Rebel fleets raged, and the Endor strike team sought to destroy the Endor base, the Emperor tempted Luke to give in to his anger. In a moment of weakness, Luke lashed out, but Vader stopped his strike and dueled him once again. Throughout the duel, the two seemed to be evenly matched, but Vader wasn't trying to kill Luke, only to lead him closer to the dark side. This succeeded when Luke used the dark side to overwhelm his father and kick him down several stairs. When the Emperor told him to use his anger again, Luke realized what he had done and took a more defensive position. Eventually, Vader telepathically sensed the existence of his daughter and Luke's twin sister, Leia, and threatened to corrupt her instead.

During his early days as a Sith, Vader believed in justice and would fight to bring it to the Empire at any cost. His impulsiveness and tendency to act in anger were both magnified as well; for instance, when he discovered that Kenobi had stowed away on his wife's ship when she came to Mustafar, he immediately assumed that she was conspiring with his former master and strangled her with the Force. Despite this, Vader did experience a significant level of regret for the decisions that he had made to save Amidala.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nHowever, all that changed following his defeat at Kenobi's hands. Having lost all that he had turned to the dark side to preserve, and having no other path, he fully embraced the dark side and became, in Palpatine's words, a \"true Sith.\"<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> Consequently, he devoted himself fully to furthering the development of his relationship to the Force, and the expansion of his power. Both due to what Palpatine taught him about the relationship between Sith master and apprentice<ref name=\"LotS\" /> and his own personal tendencies, Vader in his early apprenticeship was completely devoted to the Emperor.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> However, as his power grew, and particularly after learning of his son's existence, this devotion dwindled considerably.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 25\" />\n\nOver the years Vader developed a new, more hardened and disciplined persona. He became utterly ruthless,<ref name=\"SW1\" /> virtually devoid of mercy,<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> and was known to occasionally kill his own officers for their failures.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Eventually, the identity of Vader in the Empire had arisen tales of a dark armored [[humanoid]] who served as the Emperor's most trusted enforcer and was considered to be the most feared individual in the Empire. Rumors circulated that he lived in a castle in a world of lava and that he wielded a red lightsaber, suggesting a connection to the Sith.

Following the Battle of Naboo<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> and ten years later, Skywalker met with her at apartment following an assassination attempt on her. As Skywalker continued to protect Amidala from further attempts, they admitted their mutual love to each other. Skywalker and Amidala, following the Battle of Geonosis, married in secret.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Husband_and_wife.png|thumb|right|250px|Anakin married Padm\u00e9 following the Battle of Geonosis.]]\nDuring the Clone Wars, Skywalker and Amidala rarely saw each other due to the Clone Wars and keeping their secret. Skywalker would rescue and protect Amidala from numerous dangers such as General Grievous,<ref name=\"Malevolence 3\" /> the Zillo Beast,<ref name=\"Zillo Beast 2\" /> and the Blue Shadow Virus.<ref name=\"Blue Shadow Virus\" /> Skywalker also felt jealous towards Amidala's close friend, Senator Rush Clovis of Scipio. Despite Amidala's assurances that it was over between her and Clovis, Skywalker felt uneasy when she accepted the Jedi Council's mission to spy on Clovis. After leaving Cato Neimoidia, Skywalker assured Amidala that he never doubted her. Later, however, Skywalker did not completely trust Clovis with Amidala.<ref name=\"An Old Friend\" /> Skywalker attacked Clovis when he tried to kiss Amidala, but Amidala thought they should not see each other for a while.<ref name=\"The Rise of Clovis\" /> When Clovis appeared to have rejoined the Separatists, Skywalker led his forces and personally attempted to rescue Amidala.<ref name=\"Crisis at the Heart\" />\n\nLater when Amidala revealed that she was pregnant, Skywalker had premonitions about Amidala dying in childbirth. Skywalker's fear eventually led him into the dark side; Palpatine told him of how Darth Plagueis taught his apprentice how to cheat death, but he later stated he needed Skywalker's help to learn the power.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Being focused on the possibility that Amidala could be saved, Skywalker did not notice the contradiction.<ref name=\"Certain POV 193\">{{InsiderCite|193|A Certain Point of View (Star Wars Insider)|A Certain Point of View}}</ref> On Mustafar, Skywalker, now Darth Vader, Force-choked her when he believed that she brought Kenobi to kill him.

Despite his relative laziness, Skywalker was the best duelist in his class, even though he started later than his classmates. In his training he preferred lightsaber combat to Force mastery, and he spent more time on the physical aspects of becoming a Jedi. By the time he was nineteen, Skywalker was so gifted and skilled in dueling that he believed he already rivaled Master [[Yoda]]. When the Clone Wars began Skywalker was a skilled enough duelist to hold his own against one of the most skillful swordsmen in the galaxy, Count Dooku, lasting longer than his own master, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> During the war, his frequent engagement in duels with individuals such as the informal Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress,<ref name=\"CloneWarsFilm\" /><ref name=\"The Hidden Enemy\" /><ref name=\"ARC Troopers\" /> Savage Opress,<ref name=\"Witches of the Mist\" /> Count Dooku,<ref name=\"CloneWarsFilm\" /><ref name=\"Crisis on Naboo\" /><ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" /> and fallen Jedi Barriss Offee<ref name=\"The Wrong Jedi\" /> allowed him to greatly improve his capabilities with a lightsaber. By the end of the war, Skywalker had the skill to single-handedly defeat Dooku in combat, despite the fact that the Count was one of very few duelists who could hold his own against Yoda himself. Dooku's taunts angered Skywalker, which unintentionally resulted in him tapping into the power of the dark side, also contributing to his victory.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nDuring his duel with Kenobi, Skywalker proved to be equally matched with his former master. Skywalker was defeated only when Kenobi exploited his hubris and blinding rage to dismember him.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Skywalker was considered by some amongst the Jedi, such as Kanan Jarrus, to have been the greatest warrior the Order had during the Clone Wars, with the only possible exceptions being Yoda and Mace Windu. His former Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, once acknowledged Skywalker as someone powerful who rarely lost his battles.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\nSkywalker was particularly skilled in [[Form V]]\u2014both the Shien and Djem So variants. He was able to deflect not only blaster fire with ease,{{Fact}} but also shots from freighters.<ref name=\"LotS\" /> He made good use of Djem So's strength-based strikes and counterattacks to overpower or overwhelm his opponent.<ref name=\"The Wrong Jedi\" /> Skywalker also used [[Jar'Kai]] on some occasions: He used Kenobi's lightsaber during his first duel with Count Dooku on Geonosis,<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> he wielded Barriss Offee's own lightsaber against her along with his own,<ref name=\"The Wrong Jedi\" /> and he wielded Dooku's lightsaber in addition to his own to execute him after defeating him on the ''Invisible Hand''.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nSkywalker was also adept in the use of [[Form IV]], often incorporating its techniques (primarily acrobatics) into his dueling style. He was well aware that the key to deflecting the fire of multiple adversaries was fluidity of motion, which he mastered enough to having adjusted the classic techniques of Form IV to better defend against ranged attackers. He demonstrated this in a holographic recording, later found in [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron]].<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\n[[File:SWVader11Granov.png|thumb|right|220px|Darth Vader wields his Sith lightsaber.]]\nAfter Darth Vader received his cybernetic enhancements and armor, his dueling style became visually more direct than it had been, presumably due to his armor and cybernetics affecting his physical abilities; however, Vader's style was still similar enough to how he fought as a Jedi that Admiral Tarkin was able to puzzle out Vader's former identity largely by observing him fight.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nVader continued to use Jar'Kai on various occasions. On Mustafar, he [[Telekinesis|Force pulled]] a [[Corvax descendant|smuggler]]'s lightsaber and wielded it with his own to finish off the last remaining droid in [[Corvax Fortress|Lady Corvax's sanctum]].<ref name=\"Vader Immortal\" /> Another time, Vader used his weapon with one of Darth Atrius's lightsabers against a group of thugs whom Sana Starros had hired to keep the Imperials off her back.<ref name=\"SW annual 4\" />\n\nA pragmatic combatant both as Skywalker and later as Darth Vader, he had the skill to throw an activated lightsaber to attack, guiding it with the Force,<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\" /><ref name=\"LotS\" /><ref name=\"SW2\" /><ref name=\"Episode VI\" /><ref name=\"DV12\" /><ref name=\"DV21\" /> or he would resort to lethally activating unsuspecting opponents' lightsabers.

Indeed, when his blood was tested, Skywalker's midi-chlorian count was off the scale\u2014above 20,000, reportedly even greater than Yoda's.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nWhen he was nine, Anakin was already skilled in having quick reflexes and precognition. This was something he used to an advantage when he participated in pod racing. He was also able to sense what things were without looking at them.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nIn his teen years, Skywalker's Force training progressed to the point where he was able to manifest various abilities, and Kenobi thought of him as being \"advanced for his age.\"<ref name=\"OW&A 2\" /> He was very skilled at using the Force to scan his surroundings, such as when he sensed poisonous kouhuns infiltrating Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's bedroom from standing outside.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> He was also skilled at sensing other people's feelings<ref name=\"Sabotage\" /> and disturbances in the Force.<ref name=\"Brothers\" /> Skywalker also showed aptitude for precognitive dreams, as when he foresaw the deaths of both his mother and his wife in dreams,<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> but also of himself becoming a Jedi, back when he lived with his mother on Tatooine.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> However, Skywalker struggled in using the Force to control and befriend animals,<ref name=\"OW&A 2\" /> noting that Kenobi was much better at it than he was.<ref name=\"Crystal Crisis\" />\n\nSkywalker was skilled in telekinesis<ref name=\"Episode II\" />: Even as a late beginner, by his own admission, he was very good at it, better than any of his peers and most of the older Padawans as well.<ref name=\"OW&A 3\" /> He could lift lightsabers in the air and ignite them with ease, as he did once to scare a pair of Padawans who had called him a \"slave to his emotions.\"<ref name=\"OW&A 1\" /> Despite having an exceptionally strong connection to the Force, Skywalker tended not to use it very often during lightsaber duels and focused instead on the physical aspects of combat. This tendency held even when facing opponents who made liberal use of the Force during duels, such as Count Dooku.<ref name=\"Crisis on Naboo\" />\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Anakin's power and skill continued to increase. He became capable of utilizing telekinesis to accomplish such esoteric tasks as creating air bubbles around another person's head to enable breathing underwater, as shown when he saved Padm\u00e9's life at Mon Cala.<ref name=\"Prisoners\" /> During his mission to Utapau, Anakin was able to feel brain waves on a dead body,<ref name=\"A Death on Utapau\" /> and when he first met Grand Admiral Thrawn, he was able to feel his thoughts by reaching out to him through the Force.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> At one point during the war, Skywalker was able to telekinetically subdue both the Son and the Daughter simultaneously. However, this empowerment was lost when the Dark side grew too powerful and disrupted the balance in the Force.<ref name=\"Overlords\" />\n\n[[File:Vader_no_at-at.png|thumb|right|250px|Vader uses the Force to stop an AT-AT from crushing him on Cymoon 1.]]\nAfter his cybernetic reconstruction, Vader's connection to the Force strengthened considerably, to the point where his master Darth Sidious once complimented his powers as being \"unparalleled.\"<ref name=\"LotS\" /><ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> Though his injuries had physically crippled him, Vader believed that the suffering that he had experienced had both perfected his spirit and freed him from the needs of the flesh, allowing him to concentrate solely on his relationship to the Force.<ref name=\"LotS\" /> He demonstrated enough telekinetic power to stop an [[AT-AT]] from stepping on him and had been in the process of tearing it apart before he was interrupted in doing so.<ref name=\"SW2\" /> On another occasion he telekinetically lifted two [[AT-DP]] walkers off of himself without any apparent strain.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" /> He also demonstrated the ability to grab hold of an engine-damaged Twi'lek freighter and bring it to the ground,<ref name=\"LotS\" /> and crush a ''Lambda''-class shuttle's engines in midflight to take it down.<ref name=\"DV15\" /> He was able to utilize a Force push in a wave-like manner that was powerful enough to blow apart numerous [[lyleks]] simultaneously, despite the fact that the creatures' carapaces were impervious to even heavy blaster fire.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\nVader could also project Force barriers to protect himself and others.<ref name=\"DV4\" /> These barriers were powerful enough to protect him while submerged in the lava of Mustafar, though only for a short time. On at least one occasion, he demonstrated that he was able to telekinetically manipulate targets without the need to gesture at them as virtually all other Force adepts did. This granted him the ability to throw objects with the Force whilst actively engaged in swordplay.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> He was also capable of using the Force Stasis ability and was skilled enough in its execution that on one occasion he used it to freeze two [[Inquisitor]]s simultaneously.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 20\" />\n\nVader was also capable of using his telekinetic abilities to perform extremely delicate, complex, and precise tasks. On one occasion, he returned his badly damaged cybernetic limbs to perfect working order by dismantling a broken droid and telekinetically repairing himself with its components.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 4\" /> He also demonstrated the ability to crush internal organs with the Force.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> At one point during an interrogation he used the Force to inflict torturous amounts of pain on several insurgent prisoners, to the point of causing heart failure in one of them.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nSkywalker developed a tendency to use Force choke over the course of his time as a Jedi, especially when angered or using it as a means of interrogation when an individual was uncooperative.<ref name=\"Brain Invaders\" /><ref name=\"Slaves of the Republic\" /><ref name=\"The Wrong Jedi\" /> Skywalker would go on to use this power to deadly effect when he assumed the name Vader, generally using the choke to kill those who insulted him or failed to meet his expectations as well to instill fear.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"Episode V\" /> He also used the technique to twist, crush or snap his victim's neck, notably executing Commander Fox this way as well as other clone troopers and later stormtroopers.<ref name=\"The Chosen One 1\" /><ref name=\"Darth Vader 3\" /><ref name=\"SW2\" />\n\nLike most Force adepts, Vader also had the ability to vastly augment both his strength and speed with the Force.<ref name=\"LotS\" /> He was also very skilled at [[Force jump|using the Force to leap]] great distances.<ref name=\"LotS\" /> During the [[mission to investigate Geonosis]], Captain Rex remarked that Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus had yet to demonstrate Skywalker's skill with Force jumps, despite having just jumped across a chasm more than 40 meters wide.<ref name=\"GoG1\">{{Rebels|Ghosts of Geonosis}}</ref><ref name=\"logical-conclusion\">The ''[[Ghost]]'' is 43.9 meters long, and it was able to fit down this chasm along its length.

He was also able to survive the Battle of Naboo, and he went on to improve his skills in flying and aerial combat. Throughout the Clone Wars, Anakin was known for being the best pilot in the Republic and was known for leading the charge in battles and coming out alive. He was very skilled in chasing down targets, shaking off-target locks, and outmaneuvering opponents. His strength in the Force also gave him quick reflexes, an ability that would help in dodging fire and focusing in on enemy targets. He also displayed incredible precognition, as he was capable of predicting his targets' movements during dogfights with pinpoint precision. He once managed to land the ''Invisible Hand'' when it was half-destroyed and breaking up in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> After becoming Vader, he remained an exceptionally skilled pilot, as shown when he single-handedly almost destroyed Phoenix Squadron in a lone TIE Advanced x1, easily out-flying their entire fleet and forcing their command to abandon ship.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" /> He also obliterated several Alliance squadrons during the Battle of Vrogas Vas.<ref name=\"SW:VD\" /> Despite this, Skywalker would occasionally be shot down during his combat piloting career.<ref name=\"CloneWarsFilm\" />\n\nAlthough he mainly used lightsabers, Skywalker was extremely proficient at the use of [[blaster pistol]]s.<ref name=\"In Search of the Crystal\" /> He also had some training on the use of [[Staff|staves]], a skill he once taught to a Felucian village so that they could defend themselves.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunters\" /> Skywalker spoke [[Galactic Basic Standard]]<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> and [[Huttese]],<ref name=\"CloneWarsFilm\" /><ref name=\"DV2\" /><ref name=\"AEYNTK\" /> and understood the [[Bith (language)|Bith language]].<ref name=\"Friends and Enemies\" /> As Vader, he learned the ancient [[Ur-Kitt\u00e2t|Sith tongue]], and he spoke it along with his master, Sidious.<ref name=\"LotS\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|Your sleeves are cut to allow exaggerated movements of your arms.

As the ''Star Wars'' universe continued to evolve, Skywalker's character would be developed and explored in detail, with [[George Lucas]] eventually making him into a central figure in the six initial ''Star Wars'' films.

The concept of a cybernetic Vader was created when the concept artist drew the opening scene where ''Tantive IV'' was being boarded. It was initially imagined that Darth Vader would fly through space to enter the ship, necessitating a suit and breathing mask. This suit was later made permanent and incorporated in the story.

Jones was not credited until Episode VI, as he felt he didn't deserve the credit due to only supplying his voice for Vader. For fight scenes in Episodes V and VI, swordsman [[Bob Anderson]] wore the suit. In new footage shot for the Special Edition of the original trilogy, actor and former [[Industrial Light & Magic]] visual effects artist [[C.

George Lucas stated that redeemed Jedi would revert as a Force ghost to their pre-fall form.\n\nIn ''Revenge of the Sith'', Christensen wore the Vader suit, which was specifically designed to fit his body. His stand-in double for the UK shoot was [[Christian Simpson|Christian J Simpson]], who also played alongside the young Skywalker in Episode I as [[Bravo Six]], Lt. [[Gavyn Sykes]]. The few lines of the suited Vader speaking are of Jones, but at one time, there was some debate over this. Some fans believed that he didn't participate at all, since his name doesn't appear in the credits of ''Revenge of the Sith'', and the voice heard in the first trailer for the movie was Christensen's, albeit altered digitally. The matter was settled with the Summer 2005 issue of [[Starlog (magazine)|''Starlog'']], in which producer [[Rick McCallum]] stated they had Jones for a partial day of work on ''Revenge of the Sith''.\n\nIn the [[Star Wars Legends|Legends]] [[Star Wars (radio)|radio-drama adaptations]], [[Brock Peters]] performed as Vader, with [[David Birney]] performing as Skywalker on the final episode of the ''Return of the Jedi'' radio drama.

In the [[Star Wars: Clone Wars|''Clone Wars'' cartoon]], Skywalker was voiced by [[Frankie Ryan Manriquez]] as a child and [[Mat Lucas]] as an adult. In ''The Clone Wars'' CGI series and its feature film, the character is voiced by Matt Lanter. For many of the ''Star Wars'' video games, including ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Force Commander]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter]]'', Vader was voiced by [[Scott Lawrence]]; in titles, such as [[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'']] and ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'', [[Matthew Sloan]], who provides the voice of Vader in the [[Chad Vader: Day Shift Manager]] shorts, provides Vader's voice.\n\nIn the Japanese localizations, [[Wikipedia:Daisuke Namikawa|Daisuke Namikawa]] acts as the voice of Anakin as an adult, while as young Anakin, [[Wikipedia:Akiko Yajima|Akiko Yajima]] provides his voice in the Clone Wars. As Darth Vader, the voice is provided by [[Wikipedia:T\u014dru \u014chira|T\u014dru \u014chira]] in most incarnations starting with the DVD release, save for ''Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds'' (where he is voiced by [[Wikipedia:Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo|Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo]]), and a number of other substitute voices in the original films. \u014chira also by proxy, reprises his role in the Japanese version of [[Soulcalibur IV|SoulCalibur IV]]. After \u014chira's death, the role was taken up by [[Wikipedia:Taiten Kusunoki|Taiten Kusunoki]] for ''Rebels'' onwards.\n\nIn the original ending of ''Rogue One'', the final scene for Darth Vader was not him attacking and chasing the Rebels with the Death Star plans.
