During the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the [[Resistance]] and the [[First Order]], he ran a stall called [[The Wooden Wookiee]] in the [[Merchant Row (Batuu)|Merchant Row]] of [[Black Spire Outpost]] on the planet [[Batuu]]. Lunacca was responsible for carving many of the wooden drinking vessels used around the outpost, including those sold at [[Oga's Cantina]] with specific drinks.<ref name=\"GEStaff\">[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]] has official backstory elements that, though not directly published for the public, are officially canon details that can be obtained verbally from cast members working in the land.</ref>\n\nHe was an extremely skilled carver, being able to carve any object, from small trinkets to large sculptures, out of any type of wood.<ref name=\"GEStaff\" /> He made frequent trips back to his [[homeworld]],<ref name=\"Traveler's Guide\" /> including one at some point following the [[Battle of Crait]],<ref name=\"GEStaff\" /> in order to bring back supplies, such as [[wroshyr wood]], for his work. During those periods The Wooden Wookiee would temporarily close because Lunacca did not employ Batuuan locals to help with customer service. The Wooden Wookiee was a one-Wookiee operation and because most others on Batuu lacked the strength to carve [[Wroshyr tree|wroshyr]] wood, Lunacca's customers could be guaranteed that his goods were carved by his own [[Limb|hands]].<ref name=\"Traveler's Guide\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLunacca was first created for [[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]], which opened to guests at Disneyland Park on [[May 31]], [[2019]].<ref name=\"GEStaff\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]] {{1stm}}\n*''[[Elee & Me]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: Traveler's Guide to Batuu]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Artisans]]\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
