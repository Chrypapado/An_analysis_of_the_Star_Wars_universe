Like his older sister [[Vici Ramunee|Vici]], his Forcefulness was detected by a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] visiting the planet in search of candidates for [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]]. Finding them at their family's estate near [[Lir Lake]] Master [[Tannis (Jedi)|Tannis]] selected the Forceful siblings to train with the Jedi ; though she deemed the younger Ramunee too young to begin the training and assured him that she would return in two years time to retrieve him upon his ninth birthday.<ref name=\"TMDF\" />\n\nTrue to her word, Tannis returned and took Ramunee to the [[Teyan Praxeum|Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Teya IV]] to begin his training in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] while his sister continued to excel in her own training. In [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], 16-year-old Vici Ramunee reached the end of her training as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] under Mistress Tannis and was tasked with traveling alone to the [[Cave of Truth]] and to face her \"greatest foe\" as part of her [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]]. Armed only with her knowledge of the Force, her brother attempted to smuggle her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] into the cave but was turned away by his older sister, who informed him that she must obey her instructions an pass her trials honestly. Ordering her younger brother back to the praxeum, he claimed he did not know the way back and would have to accompany her into the cave.<ref name=\"TMDF\" />\n\nWith no choice, the older Ramunee allowed her brother to join with her and they successfully reached the mountains hours later. There, she sensed a large creature approaching and, with no obvious place to hide or flee, activated her lightsaber to protect her and her brother. The large, monstrous creature, however, turned out to be a [[Duinuogwuin/Legends|Duinuogwuin]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] called [[Willm Lywin]]. Lywin, amused by Ramunee's attempt to \"protect\" her brother, escorted the pair the rest of the way to Cave of Truth, where Vici Ramunee entered alone and emerged successful in her trials.<ref name=\"TMDF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVici Ramunee, who conquered her fears, and Veni Ramunee, who came to his sister's aid, shares their first names with the contents of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin latin] phrase [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni,_vidi,_vici \"Veni, vidi, vici\"], which is commonly attrubuted to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Ceasar Julius Ceasar] and translates to \"I came; I saw; I conquered.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|11|The Most Dangerous Foe}} {{1st}}{{Flash}}\n*{{Journal|9|Slaying Dragons}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ramunee, Veni}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
