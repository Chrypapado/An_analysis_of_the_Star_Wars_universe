He was killed by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] during the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|And when I die, I'll know my life will have had ''meaning''.|Jobin|Entrenched}}\nJobin was a [[Corporal/Legends|corporal]] in the [[Alliance Military/Legends|Alliance Military]], and commanded the [[4th Squad]] on Hoth in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]] during the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]]. When Imperial troops invaded with a surface attack, his platoon set out to assist Ion Control when one of his men noticed Imperial troops approaching from the South Ridge. His squad was attacked by an [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]], but Jobin was able to destroy it with a satchel charge and marched into the Ion Control center, where he killed a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] with an icicle. It was Jobin who activated [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base's]] [[V-150 Planet Defender/Legends|v-150 anti-orbital ion cannon]], which disabled an [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] in orbit.\n\nHe was killed in the battle at the hands of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] while attempting to escape Echo Base. When his squad tried to escape on a transport, Lord Vader and his stormtroopers came upon them. While he was running towards the transport, Jobin was shot and gave another Rebel trooper a holo-recording for his mother. Though he shot at Darth Vader, his efforts were to no avail. Vader levitated him off the ground and began to [[Telekinesis/Legends|choke]] him. Vader attempted to interrogate the dying man, but Jobin refused to surrender any information, even spitting on him as an act of defiance. Vader then broke his neck with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], killing him.\n\nHis mother, [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], received Jobin's message shortly before the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'' video game]] {{C|DLC}} {{C|Quote only}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'' {{C|Quote only}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'' {{Voice}}\n*[[The Empire Strikes Back (radio)|''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' radio drama]] {{Voice}}\n*[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (junior novelization)|''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' junior novel]] {{Voice}}\n*''[[Star Wars Manga: The Empire Strikes Back 1]]'' {{Voice}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] {{C|First heard}}\n*''[[Entrenched]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[One Last Night in the Mos Eisley Cantina: The Tale of the Wolfman and the Lamproid]]'' {{Flash}} {{Voice}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Empire Strikes Back: The National Public Radio Dramatization]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back'', Second Edition]] {{Qo}}\n*{{CCG|set=Hoth Limited|link=Hoth-Dark/large/breacheddefenses.gif|cardname=Breached Defenses}} {{Qo}}\n*{{GalaxyCite|10|The Ice World Cometh}} {{Qo}}\n*{{TCG|set=The Empire Strikes Back (TCG)|link=http://www.wizards.com/swtcg/images/esb/occupation.jpg|cardname=Occupation}} {{Qo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|82|Drawn By The Force}} {{Imo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|82|Ask Lobot|Ask the Master}}\n*{{SWPM|set=Ground Assault|link=http://www.swpocketmodels.com/images/cardga068.jpg|cardname=Snowtroopers}} {{Qo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Fandex Deluxe Edition]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shadow_Syndicate#Card_gallery|cardname=Breakthrough}} {{Qo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|148|Imperial Icons}} {{Qo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jobin\n|pl=Jobin Mothma\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance Army officers]]\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mothma family]]"}}}]}}}}
