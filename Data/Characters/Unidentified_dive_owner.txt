During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], he worked as a middleman and hired [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] to [[Assassination attempt on Yong Dolor|assassinate]] [[Ambassador/Legends|Ambassador]] [[Yong Dolor]]. However, the assassination attempt was foiled by the intervention of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Jyl Somtay]]. Following this event, the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] got a lead on the dive owner as he had previously been arrested for selling the [[Poison/Legends|poison]] that was found on Sing's [[Ryyk blade/Legends|ryyk blade]]. Disguised as Sing, Somtay convinced the dive owner to meet with his client in his [[Lorn's office|office]]. Yong Dolor's assistant, [[Lorn (aide)|Lorn]], was then exposed as the instigator of the assassination attempt. Revealing her true identity, Somtay arrested both Lorn and the dive owner.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCWUKCite|6.28|Jedi Masquerade}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified criminals]]"}}}]}}}}
