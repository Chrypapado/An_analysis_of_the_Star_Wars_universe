The son of an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucrat]], Harleys grew up believing that the Galactic Empire stood for order and justice, so he wanted to join the [[Imperial Survey Corps/Legends|Imperial Survey Corps]]. Following the [[Death/Legends|death]] of his [[Diblen Harleys's mother|mother]] around his fifteenth birthday, his [[Diblen Harleys's father|father]] revealed the true nature of the Empire to him, explaining that a career in the Imperial Survey Corps would result only in the discovery of worlds that the Empire could exploit. Angry at being lied to all his life, Harleys joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], serving in the capacity of a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and tactician. Harleys's tactics later proved effective during the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], when he assisted in the Alliance victory over the Empire. By [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], during the [[Thrawn campaign|Thrawn Crisis]]&mdash;a military campaign against the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] led by the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]]&mdash;Harleys was a [[Wing Commander/Legends|Wing Commander]] and spent much of his [[Time/Legends|time]] out of the [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]] planning missions. The Wing Commander was later involved in a scheme headed by [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo]] and [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] [[Agent/Legends|agent]] [[Winter Celchu|Winter]] to search for [[Delta Source]]&mdash;a highly effective Imperial [[Spy/Legends|spy]] within the New Republic's highest echelons.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:CoruscantGlobeE1.png|thumb|left|Diblen Harleys's homeworld of Coruscant]]\n{{Quote|It is better to stay quiet and protect yourself than die as a dissident.|Diblen Harleys' father, to his son|The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook}}\nDiblen Harleys, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]<ref name=\"TTT\" /> around [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]],<ref name=\"birth\" /> during the [[Standard day/Legends|days]] of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] rise to power.<ref name=\"TTT\" /> His [[Diblen Harleys's father|father]] was an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucrat]],<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> and Harleys was brought up to believe that the Galactic Empire stood for justice and order; he was insulated from any reports of atrocities committed by [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial forces]] or authorities. In his youth, Harleys planned to join the [[Imperial Survey Corps/Legends|Imperial Survey Corps]] and to explore both [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]] and the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]].<ref name=\"TTT\" />\n\nWhen Harleys was fifteen, his [[Diblen Harleys's mother|mother]] [[Death/Legends|died]]. Shortly thereafter, his [[Parent/Legends|father]] told Harleys what life in the Imperial Survey Corps was really like: he would spend his career searching out primitive [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] for the Empire to ruthlessly exploit. His father advised him to remain quiet rather than be seen as a dissident; however, Harleys was outraged at being lied to for many [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. He believed that he had been \"brainwashed\" to believe in the Empire and what it stood for. Aware of the truth of the Empire for the first [[Time/Legends|time]], Harleys joined the fledgling [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]].<ref name=\"TTT\" />\n\n===Alliance/New Republic service===\nHarleys served the Alliance with distinction as a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], and later, a starfighter tactician. At the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]<ref name=\"TTT\" /> in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Harleys was part of the planning staff,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> where his tactical skill helped the Alliance win a crucial victory. Following the [[Space warfare|engagement]], Harleys was steadily promoted within the [[Military rank/Legends|rank structure]] of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], the [[Politics/Legends|political]] entity that [[Declaration of a New Republic/Legends|succeeded]] the Alliance to Restore the Republic.<ref name=\"TTT\" /> Following the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|liberation]] of Coruscant in [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], the New Republic relocated its headquarters to the [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] capital, taking over the former [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]] as the base of operations for the government.<ref name=\"WG\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''</ref> Harleys was among the personnel assigned to Coruscant,<ref name=\"TTT\" /> and shortly before the [[Thrawn campaign|Thrawn Crisis]] in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], he was promoted to the rank of [[Wing Commander/Legends|Wing Commander]].<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> In that capacity, he enjoyed easy working relationships with [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Bren Derlin/Legends|Bren Derlin]] of the [[Coruscant Defense Force]] and [[Supreme Commander (Alliance/Republic)|Supreme Commander]] [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]].<ref name=\"TTT\" />\n\nDuring the Thrawn Crisis&mdash;a military campaign against the New Republic led by the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]]&mdash;the New Republic's war effort was being hampered by the presence of [[Delta Source]], an exotic recording device installed in the [[Grand Corridor]] of the Imperial Palace on the order of [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] Palpatine so that he could [[Spy/Legends|spy]] on the members of the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]]. In an effort to locate Delta Source&mdash;believing, at the time, that it was a spy within either the New Republic's government or military hierarchies&mdash;[[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo]] and [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] [[Agent/Legends|agent]] [[Winter Celchu|Winter]] began reciting scripted conversations in the Grand Corridor. It was their hope that [[Zakarisz Ghent]], a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] in the employ of the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Talon Karrde]], would be able to use the conversations to determine Delta Source's identity by working out who had heard the dialogue, then correlating it with outgoing Delta Source transmissions for which Ghent had managed to break the encryption by using sophisticated [[Computer/Legends|computer]] programs and decrypting software. One such conversation indicated that Harleys was being placed in charge of drawing up a plan to confirm that three [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers]] under construction at the [[Ord Trasi shipyards|shipyards]] of [[Ord Trasi/Legends|Ord Trasi]] were within one [[Standard month/Legends|month]] of completion.<ref name=\"tlc\">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nStanding 1.6 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] tall, Diblen Harleys possessed [[Color/Legends|blond]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Growing up, Harleys held a deep belief that the Empire was fundamentally right, and stood for order and justice in the galaxy due to his father's position as an Imperial bureaucrat. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday, Harleys learned the truth about the Empire when his father described what life would be like if he followed his goals and joined the Imperial Survey Corps. Angry at having been lied to for years, Harleys felt that he had been \"brainwashed\" to believe in the Empire. That feeling galvanized him to join the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"TTT\" />\n\nHarleys was a popular [[Commander/Legends|commander]], well liked by the [[Troop/Legends|troops]] serving under him due to his sense of humor&mdash;which was considered to be outrageous&mdash;and his dedication to protecting those under his command. He could, however, be intimidating when the need arose, or persuasive if the situation demanded it. Although Harleys wore a standard New Republic [[Rebel flight suit|flight suit]] while on duty, he chose to augment it with a single blue gemstone earring, and a pair of [[glareshades]].<ref name=\"TTT\" />\n\nDespite having a love of flying, Harleys often found that his duties kept him from the [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]] more often than he would have liked. In addition, he was a relatively young [[Officer/Legends|officer]] to hold a high rank, and as such he was often treated as an inexperienced subordinate by his peers, despite working closely with both Colonel Derlin and Admiral Ackbar.<ref name=\"TTT\" />\n\nHarleys was trained in [[unarmed combat]] and how to use a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], and he carried a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] along with a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]]. As a pilot, he was trained to fly both starfighters and [[Realspace/Legends|space]] [[Transport/Legends|transports]], and [[Astrogation/Legends|navigate]] them safely through [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]. He could also repair starfighters. In addition to flight training, Harleys was capable of driving ground and [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] vehicles. In his role as a tactician and Wing Commander, Harleys understood the inner workings of the New Republic's bureaucracy, and he had knowledge about [[Star system/Legends|planetary systems]]. A skilled commander, Harleys was capable of leading starfighter groups and Coruscant-based personnel, and he was well versed in starfighter tactics.<ref name=\"TTT\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDiblen Harleys was first mentioned in ''[[The Last Command]]'' by [[Timothy Zahn]], which was published in [[1993]]. Referred to only as \"Wing Commander Harleys,\" he nonetheless received an entry in the ''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]'' by [[West End Games]] in [[1994]], a book that gave him a first name and a biography. This information was subsequently reprinted in ''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''.\n\nIn ''The Last Command'', Wing Commander Harleys is referenced in relation to a plan to determine whether or not ''Imperial''-class [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]] under construction at Ord Trasi are nearing completion. However, this mention comes during the scene where Leia Organa Solo and Winter are playing out scripted conversations in an effort to reveal who or what Delta Source is. Because of this, it is unclear whether or not Harleys was involved in such a mission, or if it was false information. However, ''The Last Command Sourcebook'' does confirm that Star Destroyers were being built at Ord Trasi.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Last Command]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]'' {{1stID|Diblen}}\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Diblen Harleys\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harleys, Diblen}}\n[[Category:Alliance Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Starfighter Corps personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
