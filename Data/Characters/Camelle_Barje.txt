The lives of her and her [[Tekil Barje|son]] were saved from [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken]] warriors by their [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] leader, [[Sharad Hett]]. By the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Barje ran the motel in the town of [[Wayfar]].\n\n==Biography==\nCamelle was born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. She married [[Conil Barje|Conil]]<ref name=\"SW7\" /> and the pair lived in the [[Mid Rim]]. At some point, Camelle worked as a [[Nurse/Legends|nurse]]. Camelle and Conil decided to settle on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]<ref name=\"GG1-2\">[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]</ref> to raise their newborn son, [[Tekil Barje|Tekil]].<ref name=\"SW7\" />\n\nCamelle and Conil sold everything to move to Tatooine, purchasing land from [[Zygian's Banking Concern]]. Arriving on Tatooine, Camelle and Conil established a [[Moisture farm/Legends|moisture farm]]. Ever since arriving on the planet, Camelle and Conil heard rumors of [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] attacks, mainly from people at [[Tosche Station/Legends|Tosche Station]]. Conil was determined to get some weapons to be on the safe side, so they traveled to the ancient trading site [[Mochot Steep/Legends|Mochot Steep]]. Conil told Camelle to stay with Tekil in the cart while he purchased some guns.<ref name=\"SW7\" />\n\nDuring the visit to Mochot Steep, a Tusken Raider war-band led by [[Sharad Hett]] attacked the settlement. During the attack, Conil told Camelle to ride away and save Tekil. While trying to help another moisture farmer, Conil was killed by one of the Tuskens. Camelle tried to escape, but a Tusken killed the [[Dewback/Legends|dewback]] pulling her cart.<ref name=\"SW7\" />\n\nSprawled on the ground, a Tusken took Tekil from her arms while another aimed a rifle at her head. Hett saw the commotion and saw the Tusken holding Tekil brandishing a knife. Igniting his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Hett cut off the Tusken's hand. Camelle begged for her life, and Hett returned Tekil to her and blessed her leaving.<ref name=\"SW7\" />\n\nBy the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Barje lived in [[Wayfar]] and ran the motel on the edge of town.<ref name=\"GG1-2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBy the time of the Galactic Civil War, Barje was a fair shot with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and still remembered some of her medical training.<ref name=\"GG1-2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCamelle Barg\u00e9 was first mentioned in the [[1995]] [[West End Games]] supplement [[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]. In [[1999]], [[Star Wars (1998) 7|''Star Wars'' (1998) 7]] featured the character with the altered name of Camelle Barje. This spelling was continued in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''. This article assumes the spelling of \"Barje\" is correct over the original spelling of \"Barg\u00e9.\"\n\nIn the one issue in which Barje appears, her name is also spelled \"Camella\"; this was established to be a nickname in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 7|''Star Wars'' (1998) 7]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]] {{ID|Camella Barg\u00e9}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Camelle Barje\n|pl=Camelle Barje\n|fi=Camelle Barje\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barje, Camelle}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
