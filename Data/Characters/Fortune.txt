He worked with Tuz, posing as his [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]], assisting in the capture of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] equipment and delivering the shipments to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name=\"XWOSG\" />\n\nIn [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], several months into the operation, [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] Fortune, along with Tuz, Wirriz, and a pair of [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorreans]], arrived aboard the Alliance [[MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser|MC80 ''Home One'' type Star Cruiser]] [[Independence/Legends|''Independence'']] to deliver stolen Imperial technology and intelligence for an [[Attack on the Imperial repair dock|upcoming operation]] to Commanders [[H. S'man|S'man]] and [[Hamo Blastwell]]. While there, they encountered [[Samuel Raider]], [[Puck Naeco/Legends|Puck Naeco]], and [[Keyan Farlander/Legends|Keyan Farlander]] of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Red Squadron]]. Raider identified Tuz from a previous negative experience, calling the Mon Calamari a swindler and a cheat. After a brief altercation between Sam Raider and one of the Gamorreans, Fortune explained his role in Tuz's partnership with the Alliance, but expressed doubt at the pirate's claims of true allegiance to the Rebellion, before leaving the [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]].<ref name=\"XWOSG\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[X-Wing: The Official Strategy Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[X-Wing Collector's CD-ROM: The Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
