And you can bet I'm gonna live up to that handle&mdash;if I can ever get off this crummy planet.|Jimm Doshun|Star Wars (1977) 8}}\n'''Jimm Doshun,''' also known as '''\"the Starkiller Kid\"''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native to the [[City/Legends|village]] of [[Onacra]] on [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]]. Orphaned at the age of three, Doshun was raised by an obsolete [[tractor-robot]], [[FE-9Q]], and grew to become a rebellious teenager. His village was victimized by [[Serji-X Arrogantus]] and the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]] gang, and when the elders refused to actively fight their aggressors, Doshun grew irritable. Hoping to impress a local girl, [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri Shen]], Doshun equipped himself with weaponry and set off with FE to the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] of [[Tun Aduban]].\n\nThere he found the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who was putting together a ragtag team of [[gunslinger]]s to defend Onacra from Arrogantus. Doshun impressed Solo, and was granted entry into the team. Together with the other members of the team, later dubbed the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]], Doshun helped [[Battle of Aduba-3|defend]] Onacra from both Arrogantus, and a [[Behemoth from the World Below|gargantuan beast]] of [[Sithspawn|ancient origin]]. With the attackers driven off, Doshun had impressed Shen, and the two were later [[Marriage/Legends|married]]. Doshun later fell afoul of the lethal [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Beilert Valance/Legends|Beilert Valance]], from whom he helped defend Onacra once again. In the following years, he sired [[Hanna Doshun|two]] [[Second Doshun child|children]] with Merri.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nJimm Doshun [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] was a native of [[Onacra]], a [[Farm/Legends|farming]] [[City/Legends|village]] on the remote [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]]. When he was [[Youngling/Legends|three years old]], his [[Parent/Legends|parents]] were [[Death/Legends|killed]] in a [[high-hound]] attack. In the wake of their deaths, he was raised by the villagers of Onacra as a collective whole. The daily nurturing of the boy fell to the Doshuns' aged [[tractor-robot]], [[FE-9Q]]. The droid attempted to pass on the Doshuns' values and education to young Doshun, and although the boy openly rebelled against the droid, he felt a great deal of affection for it. As a teenager, Doshun became difficult, and found himself in a great deal of trouble time and time again. FE would often provide support, but Doshun continually exploited the fact that the droid was programmed to do exactly as he willed.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nHe was furious that the town elders would not defend themselves against the marauding [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]] of [[Serji-X Arrogantus]]. Doshun armed himself with a [[sling]] and his [[hunting knife]], confident that he would be able to hold his own. He also sought to impress a local girl, [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri Shen]], in spite of his youth and inexperience. In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Doshun was incensed by the news that one of the town leaders, [[Ramiz]], planned to travel to the spaceport of [[Tun Aduban]] to enlist aid in finally mounting some sort of defensive measure against Arrogantus&mdash;especially in light of the fact that the port had actually spawned the likes of Arrogantus and his Cloud-Riders.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n===\"The Starkiller Kid\"===\n{{Quote|Me an' my ''robot's'' ready, leader man!|Jimm Doshun|Star Wars (1977) 9}}\nDetermining that he would travel to Tun Aduban himself, Doshun armed himself with a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], dubbed himself \"The Starkiller Kid\", and brought FE-Q9 along with him to the township, which he himself had never visited before. The sixteen year old and the droid managed to sneak into [[Locru's Central Saloon]],<ref name=\"g4\" /> hoping to join a posse that was being assembled there. When the man organizing the posse, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], interviewed Doshun, the young boy admitted that he hoped to get offworld. Solo believed that FE would be of use, but he demanded that Doshun provide him with three reasons why he should be brought along. The young man explained that he had been stuck on Aduba-3 all his life, and despaired that he would go insane if he stayed there any longer. Solo inquired as to Doshun's experience in operating a blaster&mdash;the young man assured that he was a seasoned [[Gunslinger|gunman]], but Solo was incredulous.<ref name=\"m8\" />\n\nThe [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] was nonetheless impressed by Doshun's pluck and enthusiasm,<ref name=\"g4\" /><ref name=\"m8\" /> was reminded of another of his friends, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], who he proceeded to tell Doshun about briefly. After reminiscing, he conceded, and allowed Doshun and FE to join his posse. Excited, Doshun set off to begin packing his belongings, fully believing that he would finally be leaving Aduba-3. The next day, Doshun and FE assembled with the rest of the posse&mdash;the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], gunslinger [[Amaiza Foxtrain/Legends|Amaiza Foxtrain]], [[Spiner]] [[Hedji]], faux-[[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Don-Wan Kihotay]], and the [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]] [[Jaxxon]]. Doshun demanded to know where [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|Solo's ship]] was, but the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] explained that Doshun had the wrong idea entirely. Before he could clarify, the posse was approached by Serji-X Arrogantus and the Cloud-Riders. Solo quickly revealed that the posse would in fact be defending Onacra from them&mdash;they were the offworlders hired by Ramiz. Doshun, noting that there were only six Cloud-Riders on approach, suggested that the posse could easily take them out, but Solo disagreed, as only a few of their group were even armed with blasters. Arrogantus bandied words with Solo, and called into question the qualifications of the ragtag posse. Enraged, Doshun drew his weapon, but was cuffed by Foxtrain before he could open fire on Arrogantus. The marauder was amused, and departed while Doshun recovered.<ref name=\"m8\" />\n\n[[File:JimminBattle.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Doshun and FE deep in the pitch of battle defending Oncara.]]\nThough Doshun's time with Solo was brief, the Corellian taught the Aduban all the basic principles of gunslinging, marksmanship, and defense.<ref name=\"g4\" /> When the posse saddled up on [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] and set out for Onacra, Doshun led them on foot. On the way, they sighted a pack of high-hounds raiding some of the farmers' crops. Doshun alerted Solo to the danger the high-hounds posed, prompting the Corellian to lead the posse into a charge against the creatures. The posse did battle with the high-hounds, and when Kihotay took his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to the creatures, Doshun joined him, echoing the old man's vehement cry of victory. While one of the high-hounds was restrained by FE's telescoping arms, Doshun fatally shot it. The rest of them were driven off as Solo managed to save one of the farm girls who was being harangued by the high-hounds&mdash;none other than Merri Shen.<ref name=\"m9\">[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]]</ref>\n\nArriving in Onacra, the posse set about stabling their banthas. Later, Solo set the posse and the villagers about assembling makeshift defenses for when Arrogantus would inevitably arrive. When their work was done, the posse assembled, and Solo ensured that they were all ready for the impending attack. Jaxxon alerted the group at that moment that Arrogantus and the Cloud-Riders were on approach. The [[Battle of Aduba-3|battle]] commenced, and Doshun found himself in the thick of it. FE attempted to issue him some sort of warning, but over the din of the blaster fire, Doshun was unable to hear the tractor-droid. As one of the Cloud-Riders attempted to shoot Doshun in the back, FE raced into the line of fire, taking the shot for \"The Starkiller Kid.\" Doshun called out in vain as the loyal tractor-droid was shattered and destroyed by the blaster fire.<ref name=\"m9\" />\n\nWhen one of the villagers, known as the [[Old One]], summoned the [[Behemoth from the World Below]] into the battle, the situation was greatly complicated. Faced with the gargantuan Behemoth, which was impervious to blaster shots, and able to project concentrated blasts from its head, the posse regrouped. They were again scattered when the Behemoth caused a landslide, and both the Old One and Arrogantus were trampled by the beast. Doshun observed that in the absence of the Old One, who was controlling the beast, the Behemoth was likely to rampage through and destroy Onacra. Jaxxon agreed with Doshun, but in Foxtrain's opinion, the apparent death of Arrogantus signaled the end of their responsibility to the villagers. Solo nonetheless managed to keep the posse together, and decided that they would need to formulate some form of group attack. Before they could do so, they had to contend with yet another landslide. When they had regrouped once more, Solo realized that Kihotay had set off by himself to conquer the beast.<ref name=\"m10\">[[Star Wars (1977) 10|''Star Wars'' (1977) 10]]</ref>\n\nDoshun and the posse watched on in amazement as the elderly faux-Jedi led the Behemoth away from the posse in an effort to isolate the beast. Hedji attempted to aid Kihotay, but was struck down by the Behemoth, his natural [[Quill/Legends|quill]] throwing abilities rendered useless. Doshun could do little but watch as Solo and Chewbacca dashed to the aid, with the former taking Kihotay's lightsaber and destroying the Behemoth with it. The threat eliminated, the posse gathered themselves, and Doshun was ready to finally leave Aduba-3. However, he was approached by Shen in the aftermath, who was astonished at the bravery of his actions. Doshun was shocked, as she had barely even looked at him before, but she hoped he would change his mind about leaving the village. She thanked Solo for \"bringing out the man\" in Doshun, and the rest of the posse were subsequently paid. Doshun elected to stay with Shen,<ref name=\"m10\" /> and the two were wed shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"m10\" /> The posse would come to be known as the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]], and inspired a [[holodocumentary]] produced by [[Tri-Nebula Entertainment]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n===Valance===\n{{Quote|Between ''my'' obsession and the crew's ''greed''&hellip; we did this all for ''nothing!''|Valance realizes Jimm Doshun is not his quarry.|Star Wars (1977) 16}}\nIn time, Shen fell pregnant with their first child, and later that same year, Jaxxon and Foxtrain returned to Onacra in the Lepi's ship, the [[Rabbit's Foot/Legends|''Rabbit's Foot'']]. Jaxxon informed Doshun that he was wanted by [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], and that they were likely on their way to Aduba-3 as they spoke. Foxtrain devised a plan to outwit the hunters&mdash;the ''Rabbit's Foot'' would take to the skies and feign a crash landing near Onacra, prompting the attackers to land and emerge from their ship. Doshun would then trigger a bantha stampede and wipe out the hunters. The plan went off as planned&mdash;after re-landing near Onacra, Jaxxon and Foxtrain cleared out of their ship and hid in the tall grass while the hunters' ship, the ''[[Kill Switch]]'', landed.<ref name=\"m16\">[[Star Wars (1977) 16|''Star Wars'' (1977) 16]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Valancestarkillerkid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Valance confronts Jimm Doshun.]]\nDoshun, lamenting the absence of Solo and Chewbacca, fired his blaster into the air, triggering the stampede. The bulk of the attackers were wiped off, and Foxtrain gunned down [[Slssk|one survivor]]. The leader of the hunters, [[Beilert Valance/Legends|Beilert Valance]], attempted to steal away and get back to the ''Kill Switch'', but his path was blocked by Doshun, Foxtrain, and Jaxxon. Valance regarded Doshun, and remarked that he was not \"the boy\" he was after. The bounty hunter began to rage, realizing that the endeavor had been all for naught. He fired a blast from his [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] hand at the trio, forcing them to scatter while he escaped. As Valance flew away, Doshun believed that the situation was over, but Foxtrain wondered just who Valance had been hunting. Unbeknownst to the Star-Hoppers, his target had been Solo's friend, Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"m16\" />\n\nShen eventually gave birth to a daughter, [[Hanna Doshun|Hanna]], and as of [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], were expecting a [[Second Doshun child|second child]]. That year, Doshun received a death threat, apparently from the bounty hunter Valance,<ref name=\"g4\" /> who had been destroyed by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], several years prior.<ref name=\"m29\">[[Star Wars (1977) 29|''Star Wars'' (1977) 29]]</ref> Doshun and his wife were visited by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance]] historian [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]], who was compiling a report on the Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3. Doshun himself was unwilling to be interviewed, having been spooked by the apparent resurgence of Valance. Shen was only to happy to speak with Na'al, although her accounts of events two years prior was largely influenced by the Tri-Nebula holodocumentary.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|<nowiki></nowiki>''Me?'' Wanted by ''bounty hunters?!'' Pretty ''funny'', Jax! I'm an old married ''farmer''&hellip; Merri an' I are expectin' our ''first baby!''<nowiki></nowiki>|Jimm Doshun|Star Wars (1977) 16}}\nJimm Doshun elected to take a more aggressive approach to the likes of Arrogantus, and clashed with the town leadership's view of subservience. He had great faith in his own combat abilities at the age of sixteen, despite his total lack of experience. His departure from the town and new found combative lifestyle was partially to impress Merri Shen, with whom he was smitten. When Doshun learned that Ramiz planned to retrieve help for Onacra from Tun Aduban, the very source of their troubles. His enthusiasm proved impressive to the Corellian Han Solo, who accepted Doshun as one of his Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3.<ref name=\"g4\" /> He would become enraged when his abilities and experience were called into question, and he would respond with aggression or umbrage. Doshun was also highly impatient, seeking to leap into actions while others practiced caution.<ref name=\"m8\" /> Despite his attempts to distance himself from his humble upbringing in a farming community, he was still loyal to the people who had raised him.<ref name=\"m9\" /> He was eager to finally get off Aduba-3 after the Behemoth from the World Below was finally destroyed, but was only persuaded to stay when Merri Shen confessed an attraction for him.<ref name=\"m10\" />\n\nLargely raised by the droid FE-9Q, Doshun demonstrably resisted the droid's seniority, but secretly held a great deal of love for the droid. When he found himself in a trouble as a rebellious youth, he was often saved by FE-9Q's efforts, but Doshun would often exploit the fact that FE was programmed to do his bidding. Despite this, FE maintained a verbal superiority, even while being forced to execute the young man's instructions.<ref name=\"g4\" /> When dealing with strangers, Doshun maintained that FE was in fact his pet.<ref name=\"m8\" /> Although the boy and the droid continued to argue while they were members of the Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3, FE sacrificed himself for the ongoing survival of Doshun, a fact that distressed the young man greatly.<ref name=\"m9\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJimm Doshun, \"the Starkiller Kid,\" first appeared in [[Star Wars (1977) 8|''Star Wars'' (1977) 8]] ([[1978]]), which was written by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Howard Chaykin]]. The \"Starkiller\" name originated in earlier drafts of the script for [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'']]. It was originally to be the surname of several characters, who would later develop and become the characters of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]].<ref>''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 8|''Star Wars'' (1977) 8]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 10|''Star Wars'' (1977) 10]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 11|''Star Wars'' (1977) 11]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 16|''Star Wars'' (1977) 16]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GalaxyCite|3|ComicScan|ComicScan: Marvelously Silly Aliens}}\n*{{GamerCite|4|The Starhoppers of Aduba-3}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=swminis/article/huntwithin3|text=The Hunt Within: Valance's Tale, Mission 3: The Wrong Boy|int=The Hunt Within: Valance's Tale: Part 3|archivedate=20100206184341}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jimm Doshun\n|es=Jimm Doshun\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doshun, Jimm}}\n[[Category:Adubans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]]"}}}]}}}}
