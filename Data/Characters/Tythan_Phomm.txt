At one point, he was captured by [[Morgukai]] warriors and used as bait to lure in a [[Unidentified Jedi (Morgukai)|female]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. The [[Morgukai]] was a cult of [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-resistant [[Nikto/Legends|Nikto]] warriors who trained recruits to attack Republic targets. After defeating the Jedi, the [[Nikto/Legends|Nikto]] let Phomm go, and he would harbor a grudge agaist them for years to come. In [[3643 BBY]] Phomm resided on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] and discovered the Morgukai have set up the [[Morgukai temple]] in the area. He hired a Republic hero to attack the Morgukai, expecting them to fall in battle and satisfy the Morgukai bloodlust, but instead the hero surviced the ordeal and crippled their entire operation.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phomm, Tythan}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
