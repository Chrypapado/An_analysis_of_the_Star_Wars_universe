She was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Alderaan]] and was one of the few [[Alderaanian]] youths mentored by [[Queen]] [[Breha Organa]], which cultivated a deep respect for the [[House of Organa]]. Verlaine, a committed royalist, followed in the footsteps of her [[homeworld]]'s leaders and became a member of the Rebel Alliance, serving as a [[Rebel pilot|pilot]] in the [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps]].\n\nAfter the [[Galactic Empire]]'s deep space mobile [[battle station]], the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], [[The Disaster|destroyed]] Alderaan, Verlaine heard whispers that the Empire was hunting down surviving Alderaanians. Following the destruction of the Death Star during the [[Battle of Yavin]], Verlaine pledged her loyalty to [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]. The two defied the orders of the Rebel leadership and set out on their own [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to find and protect surviving Alderaanians from the Empire. The two first made their way to the planet [[Naboo]], where they took on a small group of Alderaanian citizens and had to inform them of their world's destruction, before heading for the planet [[Sullust]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I was one of the lucky Alderaanians mentored directly by your mother.

At a young age, she was one of only a few [[Alderaanian]] youths to be mentored by [[Queen]] [[Breha Organa]], the planet's ruling monarch. Through her time with the queen, Verlaine learned much about the culture and heritage of her [[homeworld]] and formed a life-long respect for both the queen and [[House of Organa]]. She became a committed royalist, believing in the Alderaanian [[monarchy]], and followed in the footsteps of the planet's leaders by joining the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. As a member of the Rebellion against the rule of the [[Galactic Empire]], Verlaine became a [[Rebel pilot]].<ref name=\"Leia 1\" />\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Battle of Scarif====\nIn [[0 BBY]], Verlaine participated in the [[Battle of Scarif]] as [[Gold Three]] from [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]] as part of the [[Alliance Military|Rebel support forces]] attacking the [[Shield Gate]] above [[Scarif]].<ref name=\"Visual Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref>\n\nAssisting in the space battle as the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] attacked the Shield Gate, Gold [[Squadron]] conducted several attack runs on the Shield Gate in an effort to weaken the shield.

Too much so to simply be rumor.|Evaan Verlaine and Leia Organa|Princess Leia 1}}\n[[File:Evaan_statue_memorial.png|thumb|left|250px|Verlaine visits a memorial for Queen and Viceroy Organa.]]\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, only a small group of the initial task force returned. [[Luke Skywalker]], the pilot who fired the shot that destroyed the Death Star; and [[Han Solo]], a [[smuggler]] who helped Organa bring the Death Star plans to the Rebel base and aided Skywalker in the battle, both received [[Medal of Bravery|medals]] in a [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]] held in the Great Temple. Verlaine was in attendance at the ceremony. After the medals were presented, Organa said a few words in remembrance of her parents and her homeworld. Her words were measured and lacked emotion, leading some of the assembled Rebels to refer to her as the \"[[Water|ice]] princess.\" When the ceremony ended, Verlaine remained behind and paid her respects to Queen Organa and Viceroy Organa at a memorial statue.<ref name=\"Leia 1\" />\n\nBecause the Empire learned of the location of the Rebel base before the Battle of Yavin, Rebel [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]] ordered the [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuation]] of the Great Temple. Verlaine and some of her fellow Rebels packed supplies in the base's hangar that would be loaded into the Rebel fleet that arrived at Yavin 4. While working, she and another Rebel discussed Organa's cold demeanor. The princess overheard them and approached, at which point the other Rebel quickly left, leaving Organa and Verlaine to talk on their own. Verlaine explained her loyalty to House of Organa and to the late queen, and she pledged her service to the princess, despite her initial reservations about how the princess was handling her duties in the aftermath of Alderaan's destruction. Verlaine also told Organa about rumors suggesting that the Empire was hunting down all surviving Alderaanians, rumors that Verlaine believed. Between Verlaine's concerns about Organa's leadership and the rumors, Organa decided to leave the Rebel base without a Rebel escort, in defiance of General Dodonna's orders, and [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|find]] the surviving Alderaanians to protect them. Verlaine agreed to go with her in order to preserve their planet's culture.<ref name=\"Leia 1\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_and_Evaan_debate.png|thumb|right|250px|Verlaine debates the mission to Naboo with the princess.]]\nVerlaine, Organa, and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], left Yavin 4 aboard [[Jan Dodonna's T-1 shuttle|a]] [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|T-1 shuttle]], which Verlaine piloted. Before they left, Organa sent a [[Hologram|holographic]] recording to General Dodonna informing him of why she had to leave the Rebel base in violation of his orders. Verlaine disagreed with sending the message as she believed it would lead the Rebels to send their forces to stop them from leaving, a concern that was proven right when Skywalker and [[Wedge Antilles]]&mdash;the only two members of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] who survived the Battle of Yavin&mdash;intercepted the shuttle and ordered them to turn back. Verlaine and Artoo quietly worked out a strategy in which they would lead the [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing]] pilots to believe that they had intercepted the shuttle and then release a part of the ship that the pilots would believe was an important part of the [[hyperdrive]], but that was in actuality a decoy. They did not tell the princess, as the pilots were listening into their conversations. Organa was irate once the plan was enacted, believing that Verlaine had recklessly compromised the mission by damaging the ship when it struck Antilles' X-wing. However, when the fighters backed off to avoid the presumed damage, Verlaine jumped the ship into [[hyperspace]].<ref name=\"Leia 1\" />\n\n=====Trouble on Naboo=====\n{{Quote|Is there anything you wish to share, pilot?''\"<br />\"''Just that&mdash;Ma'am, there's already a bounty on your head.

Organa thanked her for her efforts and the two made their way towards the planet [[Naboo]].<ref name=\"Leia 1\" /> During the voyage, Organa and Verlaine briefly debated the latter's role in the princess' mission, with Organa making it clear that she wanted Verlaine to be an accomplice rather than a servant. Once the shuttle arrived over Naboo, Artoo sent out a signal that falsely identified them as Imperial auditors, as Organa believed that no authorities would question them due to not wanting to interact with auditors. Verlaine was skeptical of the plan, as there was a bounty on the princess' head and Naboo was the homeworld of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. Organa felt it important to try anyway as there was a cloister of Alderaanian [[musician]]s known as [[Melodic Order]] living on the planet, and she believed that the Empire would start the eradication of surviving Alderaanians with that particular group.<ref name=\"Leia 2\">[[Princess Leia 2|''Princess Leia'' 2]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Leia_and_Evaan_arrive_on_Naboo.png|thumb|left|250px|Verlaine and Organa arrive in the city of Theed on Naboo.]]\nThe shuttle landed at a dock in [[Theed]], the [[capital]] [[city]] of Naboo. Organa identified herself under a false name, [[Minister|First Minister]] Solo, and demanded that all fees be charged to the [[Imperial Advisor's Office]]. Verlaine questioned this approach, wondering if it would have been simpler to pay cash [[credit]]s and avoid attracting Imperial attention, but Organa told her that they did not have any money on them and would instead have live by their wits. The princess abruptly stopped talking upon seeing a mural of the late [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]],<ref name=\"Leia 2\" /> who served as [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen of Naboo]]<ref name=\"Episode I\">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> and later as its Senator during the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Organa recognized her somehow and Verlaine asked who it was, but the princess brushed it off.<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\nThe group made their way through the streets of Theed, where they were spotted by [[Lord]] [[Junn]], an old friend of the princess&mdash;who was secretly working for his own benefit, and had recognized Artoo's signal as a plant that effectively alerted the Imperials that the princess was on the planet. Organa introduced Verlaine to the man, and the Rebel pilot was cautious about the encounter, particularly with the princess having taken off the hood that had been obscuring her face from those who might have recognized her. Junn led the group to his [[Junn's palace|palace]], where he revealed that he knew why Verlaine and Organa were on Naboo and offered to put them into contact with the owner of [[Club Deeja]], [[Mul Sanaka]], where Melodic Order performed via hologram. Junn left the area to speak with Sanaka and quietly inform him of the princess' identity, and Verlaine took the opportunity to make her suspicions known and tell the princess that she was still worried about the bounty on Organa's head. Organa pressed Verlaine to trust her, but the pilot still had her doubts. When Junn returned, he told them that he had been in contact with Sanaka and that they could proceed to the club.<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\n[[File:Evaan_and_Leia_fight_club_guards.png|thumb|right|250px|Verlaine and Organa fight the guards outside of Club Deeja.]]\nVerlaine and Organa made their way to Club Deeja in the [[Marina District]] of the city [[Keren]]. Their arrival attracted considerable attention and concern amongst the locals, who believed it to be an Imperial shuttle. Verlaine and Organa attempted to enter the club but were stopped by Sanaka, who claimed to believe that Organa was First Minister Solo and was there to collect the Alderaanians for the Empire. [[Snes]], the club guard, forced them to hand over their weapons, at which point he revealed that he knew who Organa really was and ordered Verlaine and the princess to enter the club. Rather than comply, the princess attacked Snes, leading to a brawl in the club's entrance between Verlaine, Organa, and the guards. The two took out the guards and Sanaka nearly shot the princess, before a fellow Alderaanian, [[Uwa Pareece]], knocked him unconscious and revealed that she too knew who the princess was.<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\nPareece, who had kept the news of the Disaster from the collective of Alderaanians she protected, led Verlaine and Organa into the club. Verlaine watched as Pareece revealed the truth to her people, and as Organa promised to protect them. The Alderaanian cloister agreed to join them, and Organa was able to barter a [[Starship|ship]], named [[Lord Junn]], from Junn in exchange for letting him live after his betrayal. The cruiser, big enough to carry the Alderaanians, followed Verlaine and Organa's shuttle as it made its way towards the planet [[Sullust]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\n=====Trouble on Sullust=====\nVerlaine and Organa were then taken to Sullust's [[Alderaan Enclave]] by a smuggler, [[Tivvy]]. There, they were taken to [[Preserver]] [[Jora Astane]]. Astane was at first suspicious that the princess was going to turn them to the Empire but Organa told her about her ship in orbit and how they were rescuing Alderaanian survivors. Astane ordered [[Covis|Clovis]] to scan the ship, ignoring Veraine's comment to trust their princess. As Astane toured them the Enclave, they got into an argument. Verlaine accused Astane of being a hypocrite and ravaging what was left of Alderaan's culture. Their conversation was interrupted by the replay of a transmission between Lord Junn and an Imperial cruiser. Verlaine and Organa realized that there was a [[Tace|traitor]] in their midst aboard the ship but Astane accused them of being traitors, as they found out that the cruiser had entered the orbit. Astane's troops open fired on them and Verlaine protected Organa as they made their way to a computer to warn Lord Junn of the incoming Imperials.<ref name=\"Leia 3\">[[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]]</ref>\n\nAs more troops fired upon them, R2 intervened and they escaped into a waterway. As they were studying the map Verlaine insisted Organa to not blame herself for what happened to Alderaan. The group then encountered [[Rockrender]]s who fed on dense minerals. R2 led the creatures to the stormtroopers who had infiltrated the enclave and were firing upon the Alderaanians. With their forces combined, all the Alderaanians defeated the Imperials and on Astane's command knelt before their princess.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\n[[Nien Nunb]], a [[Sullustan]] smuggler, transported the Alderaanians off Sullust. Verlaine later oversaw supplies and weapons being bought from Nunb's ship, the ''[[Mellcrawler]]'', to the ''Lord Junn''. She then took Nunb to meet with Organa, to express their gratitude. Organa awarded Nunb the Chalcedony waves from her late mother, Queen Breha Organa.<ref name=\"Leia 4\">[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]]</ref>\n\n=====Rescue on Skaradosh=====\n[[File:VerlaineLordJunn-PrincessLeia5.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Princess Evaan]]\nVerlaine then rescued Organa from Dreed and his stormtroopers using Nunb's ship to pass the Star Destroyer. Organa then ordered Verlaine to warn the ''Lord Junn ''of the Star Destroyer's imminent arrival, and were joined by thousands of other Alderaanian survivors. Verlaine and Organa then brought Tula back to her sister Tace. Verlaine then encouraged Organa to continue leading her people with Verlaine as her friend. Following their victory over the Empire, Verlaine celebrated alongside Nunb, Organa and other Alderaanians. Before Organa left to return to the Rebel Alliance, Organa recommended that the Alderaanians elect a new princess to lead them and said that Verlaine should be the one elected.<ref name=\"Leia 5\">[[Princess Leia 5|''Princess Leia'' 5]]</ref>\n\n=====Evacuating Yavin=====\n[[File:Evaan_s_punch.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Evaan punches her way to the bridge]]\nAccording to the [[cartographer]] [[Emil Graf]], as the Alliance evacuated their base on Yavin, they were intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer. It was up to Verlaine to lead a team to stop the Destroyer. Although they took the bridge, the Imperials had locked down the controls. As her troops argued about what to do, she went to the hangar to pilot a [[Raider-class corvette|''Raider''-class corvette]], which she then rammed into the mighty vessel, ejecting at the last moment. The impact was enough to knock it off course when it fired, causing the blast to level the top of a nearby mountain. The act bought enough time to finish the evacuation.<ref name=\"Tales: Flat Mountain of Yavin\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=2|story=[[Tales from Wild Space: The Flat Mountain of Yavin]]}}</ref>\n\n====Operation Starlight====\n{{Quote|I've got one on me!

Therefore, the events of ''Star Wars'' 10, in which Operation Starlight occurs, must be around 3 [[Galactic standard calendar|ABY]].</ref> Verlaine was recruited into [[Starlight Squadron]] as part of the [[Fourth Division]]'s [[Operation Starlight]]. The squadron was tasked with finding the scattered divisions of the Rebel Alliance fleet following the [[Battle of Hoth]], to warn them that the Galactic Empire had cracked Alliance communications and to deliver a new [[Trawak]] code that [[C-3PO]] and his team had developed. During their search, the squadron discovered wreckage of the [[Sixth Division]] near [[Felucia]] and encountered Imperial [[Viper probe droid|probe droids]] waiting nearby. The probe droids latched onto the astromechs of the X-wings and attempted to access their archives. Fearing the probe droids getting the other rendezvous points, Wedge Antilles suggested shooting them off, however [[Shara Bey]] ([[Starlight Leader]]) questioned their ability to actually pull it off. Instead, Bey ordered all pilots to set their astromech's self-destruct and eject them. However, doing this meant losing their nav data and getting back home. With no other choice, the droids ejected and detonated, saving their valuable data from the Empire. With no time to catch their breath, the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Tarkin's Will]]'' arrived and attacked the squadron.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" />\n\n====New Republic====\n{{Quote|I am a pilot for the New Republic, yes.

Even after the destruction of Alderaan, Verlaine pledged her loyalty to Princess Organa, seeing her as the rightful queen and leader of the remnants of the Alderaanian people.
