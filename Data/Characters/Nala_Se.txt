You are Kaminoan property.|CT-5555 \"Fives\" and Nala Se|Fugitive}}\n'''Nala Se''' was a [[Kaminoan]] [[Gender|female]] [[doctor]] and [[scientist]] who served the [[Galactic Republic]] throughout the [[Clone Wars]]. As the [[Chief Medical Scientist]] on her [[homeworld]] of [[Kamino]], she played a key role in [[Cloning|engineering]] the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and, during the [[Galaxy|galactic]] conflict, assisted in the rehabilitation of battle-wounded [[clone trooper]]s. Although she cared for injured clones even when [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[Confederacy military|forces]] threatened her life as well as her [[soldier]]s, Nala Se had a ruthless side to her, insisting to [[Jedi General]] [[Shaak Ti]] that clone [[trooper]]s were Kaminoan property, and therefore, disposable assets.\n\nShe was also one of the few individuals that knew about [[Order 66|Clone Protocol 66]], a secret directive encoded into the [[behavioral modification biochip]] of every clone in the [[Republic Military]]. Believing the chips acted as a safeguard against renegade [[Jedi]], Nala Se went to great lengths to preserve the secrecy of Protocol 66 during [[the galaxy]]-wide Clone Wars. Se was also in charge of [[Omega]], a [[Genders|female]] unaltered clone assisting her with medical duties. When Omega attempted to escape with [[Clone Force 99]], Nala Se assisted in their escape and sabotaged further attempts to capture the young clone in order to protect her. Se later witnessed the new Empire subjugate her home and bring down her people. Se herself, however, was spared from this fate as the Empire sought to use her exceptional talents with cloning science for their own purposes, transporting the Chief Scientist to a secret facility on the planet [[Weyland]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Creation of the clone army===\n{{Quote|Do not be afraid, your friend is in ''quite'' capable hands.

While coordinating the evacuation of the station's staff and patients, she was informed by [[Admiral]] [[Wullf Yularen]] that the Separatist [[Battle of the Kaliida Nebula|attack]] was imminent&mdash;making it impossible to completely abandon the facility in [[time]]. However, the [[Kaliida Shoals/Legends|Kaliida Shoals]] station was saved through the actions of the [[Jedi General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and his [[Padawan|apprentice]], [[Jedi Commander]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], before Grievous could destroy it.

As the chief medical scientist on Kamino and one of the cloning program's founders, Nala Se was tasked with discovering the cause behind the clone's malfunction. She subjected the clone to a hyper test which caused her patient to undergo extreme convulsions. The test's data revealed no signs of infection, but Nala Se recognized the clone's actions and aggressive behavior as signs of a premature activation of Protocol 66. Alarmed by this discovery, she communicated her findings to the Kaminoan [[Prime Minister]] [[Lama Su]] and [[Darth]] Tyranus, leading the latter to insist that they terminate the clone in order to protect the secrecy of the inhibitor chip and its true nature. However, the [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC trooper]] [[CT-5555]] conducted his own test on CT-5385 which, despite its fatal consequence, led to the discovery of the chip.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" />\n\nThe ARC trooper's interference caused Tyranus to doubt the clone army's reliability in the event of an intentional activation of Protocol 66, although Nala Se assured him that the preemptive execution was an anomaly. As for the clones' growing sense of individuality, she believed that it was due to the Jedi's influence, yet remained confident that it would not interfere with the execution of the protocol. When CT-5555 discovered that every clone had a bio-chip in their brain, Nala Se claimed that it was a safeguard designed to suppress the more aggressive tendencies of the clones' template, Jango Fett.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\n[[File:FivesOnTheLam-Fugitive.png|thumb|right|250px|Clone Protocol 66 was a closely-guarded secret, one that Nala Se was determined to protect at any cost.]]\nAgainst the protests of Nala Se, Shaak Ti decided to take CT-5555 to the [[Grand Republic Medical Facility]] on [[Coruscant]] along with his bio-chip and that of the late CT-5835, believing the clone should have an audience with [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. Fearing that the Jedi would discover the true programming in the bio-chips, Nala Se accompanied them to the Republic [[capital]], where she secretly drugged the clone in order to make him appear unstable and his testimony unreliable. At the medical facility she asserted that the ARC trooper was dangerous without his control chip, and that the death of Tiplar was the result of a [[virus]] that infected CT-5835. Despite her efforts, the secrecy of Protocol 66 was ultimately saved when CT-5555 attempted to assassinate Palpatine after learning of the chancellor's involvement in the conspiracy. Palpatine entrusted the bio-chips to Nala Se for safekeeping, knowing that the Kaminoan scientist would send them to his [[Sith apprentice]], Darth Tyranus.<ref name=\"Orders\" />\n\nNala Se made a [[Hologram|holographic]] recording of her report on the situation, in which she stated that, as confirmed by an independent investigation, CT-5555's inhibitor chip had malfunctioned. While both the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] and the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] committee accepted the investigation's conclusions, CT-7567 had filed a grievance report on the matter. When Chancellor Palpatine activated Protocol 66 later that [[Standard year|year]], now-former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was [[Skirmish aboard the Tribunal|targeted]] by CT-7567 and other troopers while traveling aboard a [[Tribunal|Republic attack cruiser]]. Before attacking her, CT-7567 managed to tell her to find \"Fives,\" CT-5555's nickname, prompting Tano to view Se's report as well as CT-7567's grievance report after she evaded the clones' initial attempt to eliminate her.<ref name=\"Shattered\">{{TCW|Shattered}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial Era===\n====Defection of Clone Force 99====\n{{Quote|The inhibitor chip augmentation was a success.

When Clone Force 99, a squad of modified clones, returned to Kamino, they were greeted by Omega; Nala Se instructed Omega to remain with her. Nala Se later met with [[Admiral]] and [[Governor]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], who had arrived at the facility to assess the viability of using clones in the newly formed [[Galactic Empire]]. Nala Se, alongside Lama Su, spoke favorably of the clones. They also informed Tarkin of Clone Force 99's effectiveness, as well as their disregard for authority.<ref name=\"TBBAftermath\" />\n\nWhen Clone Force 99 defected from the Empire and returned to Kamino to retrieve Omega, Nala Se assisted in their escape by remotely preventing the bay doors from closing.

She was [[Mission on Bracca|captured]] on [[Bracca]] by one of the hunters, [[Cad Bane]], whom Lama Su instructed to bring to an abandoned [[Bora Vio cloning facility|Kaminoan cloning facility]] on [[Bora Vio]]. Nala Se offered to bring the mercenary's payment for Omega, but her personal interest in Omega prevented Lama Su from allowing her to go. The Prime Minister felt that Nala Se had endangered their operation, and therefore he sent his aide [[Taun We]] to retrieve Omega. Nala Se was then informed that she would be tasked with extracting the genetic material that the Kaminoans required from Omega before terminating her.<ref name=\"Bounty Lost\">{{TBB|Bounty Lost}}</ref>\n\nOmega ultimately escaped from Bane as a result of the [[Rescue of Omega|interference]] of [[Fennec Shand]], a mercenary that Nala Se secretly hired to prevent the girl from being returned to Lama Su.
