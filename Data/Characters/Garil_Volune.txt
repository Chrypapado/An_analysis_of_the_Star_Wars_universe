He was not present at the official [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] greeting on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Instead, he participated in a meeting in the garden of the [[Kandah]] residence, which convinced those present to support the accession of Ansion to the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. However, Volune was loyal to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] and urged the Jedi to be given more time to settle the Alwarich affair. During the vote, he voted, like most delegates, for remaining in the Republic.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Approaching Storm]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The Approaching Storm (audiobook)|''The Approaching Storm'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Garil Volune\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Volune, Garil}}\n[[Category:Ansion residents]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Legislators and councilors]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
