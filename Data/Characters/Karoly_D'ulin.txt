Their choice of disguise got them briefly arrested by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Parq]] before being freed by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] agent [[Riij Winward]]&mdash;although a subsequent disagreement on who should get the Hammertong information saw the Mistryl stealing his freighter to transport the [[Superlaser/Legends|superlaser]] component, while he made off with their astromech, [[D4]], and a technical readout of the weapon.\n\nDuring the Hammertong mission, Shada had regarded Karoly as keen but somewhat inexperienced; by [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], however, Karoly had become a veteran warrior, and she was dispatched by the [[Eleven Elders of the People|Eleven Elders of Emberlene]] to \"recover\" Shada on [[Borcorash]] as the Mistryl made steps to break their ties with [[Mazzic]]. Shada escaped, and Karoly's pursuit brought her to [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]], where she allied herself with [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Grodin Tierce]] against her old enemy [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Zothip]] of the [[Cavrilhu Pirates]].\n\nSubsequently, Karoly agreed to bring [[Paloma D'asima]] to [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]], to discuss an alliance between the Mistryl and the [[Imperial Remnant]]; however, when the schemes of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Vilim Disra]] were exposed, and the false [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] was revealed as the actor [[Flim]], Karoly returned to [[Emberlene]] with her leader.\n\nKaroly was probably related to [[Team Prime]] [[Manda D'ulin]], gunned down in the ambush at the Hammertong base, and also to an earlier Mistryl, [[Naradan D'ulin]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[Angela Staines]] portrayed Karoly D'ulin, disguised as [[Senni Tonnika/Legends|Senni Tonnika]], in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name=\"StarWars.com Message Boards\">{{SWBoards|url=thread.jspa?threadID=152583&start=1545|thread=Holocron continuity database questions|user=[[Leland Chee]]|date=2007-09-26|time=05:34 PM|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128092741/http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=152583&start=1545}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[When the Desert Wind Turns: The Stormtrooper's Tale]]''\n*''[[Hammertong: The Tale of the \"Tonnika Sisters\"]]'' {{1stID}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: A New Hope (Cine-Manga)|''Star Wars: A New Hope'' Cine-Manga]]\n*''[[Nightlily: The Lovers' Tale]]''\n*''[[Be Still My Heart: The Bartender's Tale]]''\n*[[Empire 15|''Empire'' 15]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]''\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]''\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Karoly D'ulin}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary]]''\n*{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Light/large/doubleagent.gif|cardname=Double Agent}} {{Po}}\n*{{InsiderCite|91|Refresher Reading}} {{Po}}\n*{{InsiderCite|95|Ask Lobot|Q&A}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 1]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Art: Visions]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{DB|character|tonnikasisters|Tonnika, Brea & Senni|archivedate=20110913184426}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/meet-the-humans-from-the-mos-eisley-cantina|text=Meet the Humans from the Mos Eisley Cantina}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Karoly D'ulin\n|nl=Karoly D'ulin\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0414'\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:D'ulin, Karoly}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Mistryl]]"}}}]}}}}
