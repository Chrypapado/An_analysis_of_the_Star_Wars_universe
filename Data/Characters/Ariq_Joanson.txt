His best friend was a fellow moisture farmer named [[Eyvind/Legends|Eyvind]]. Aside from his moisture farming, Joanson tried to create peace between the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]], the [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]], and the [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmers]]. His idea for peace sparked from an earlier encounter where he had made peace between himself and the Tuskens by leaving water for them at the edge of his farm. During his first attempt at making peace between the three groups, they were ambushed by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] in an attempt to continue hostilities between the settlers and the Tuskens. Knowing that there was for now no hope with his plan, Joanson intended to leave Tatooine and join the growing [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], but he instead decided to stay on Tatooine and begin a local rebellion.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHe often receives the face of an [[Unidentified moisture farmer (Mos Eisley)|unidentified moisture farmer]] from [[Decipher, Inc.|Decipher]], but [[Leland Chee]] said that [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] has no visual indication of Joanson.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Drawing the Maps of Peace: The Moisture Farmer's Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Swap Meet: The Jawa's Tale]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Darksaber (novel)|''Darksaber'']] {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|69|TUS6-7, ''Tusken''}}\n*{{FFCite|79|JAW11-12, ''Jawas''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joanson, Ariq}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
