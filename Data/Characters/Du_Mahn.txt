I am Master Du Mahn, and this is the Soaring Hawkbat Clan.|Mahn welcomes Jedi Masters K'Kruhk and Sian Jeisel|Dark Times 6}}\n'''Du Mahn''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] who served the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the final [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] of the [[Republic Classic era]]. Assigned to the [[Bogden Jedi chapter house|Order's training facility]] on [[Bogden 3]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Mahn looked after the group of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Youngling/Legends|younglings]] known as the [[Soaring Hawkbat Clan]] there. When fellow Jedi [[K'Kruhk]] and [[Sian Jeisel]] landed on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] along with their [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], Mahn offered them [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] and shelter at the training facility. Those same [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] [[Massacre on Bogden 3|killed]] Mahn in front of her students during the initial execution of [[Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150|Contingency]] [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Can you tell me what's going on with the war, Master Jeisel? We were due back at the temple several days ago&mdash;but after the attack on Coruscant, Master Yoda asked us to remain here until he was certain it was safe&hellip;|Mahn explains the clan's situation to Jeisel|Dark Times 6}}\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], Du Mahn was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and eventually attained the rank of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] amongst the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Wielding a [[Color/Legends|green]]-bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], she was appointed as a [[Jedi instructor]] at the [[Jedi Temple]] on the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and oversaw the rearing of the Order's youngest [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Initiates]]. When the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] erupted between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Mahn was assigned to protect the [[Soaring Hawkbat Clan]]. By [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Mahn and her charges, along with a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] named [[Chase Piru]], had been stationed on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Bogden 3]], where they lived in the [[Bogden Jedi chapter house|training facility]] built there.<ref name=\"DT6\" />\n\n[[File:DuMahnDeath-DT6.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Du Mahn dies during Order 66]]\nPrior to the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|Battle of Coruscant]], Mahn was informed that she and the clan would soon be transported back to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Temple on the [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] capital. The conflict there delayed their return, however, and [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] asked that they remain on Bogden 3 until he was certain it was safe for them to return. Several [[Standard day/Legends|days]] after the clan was due at the temple, Mahn and her charges graciously welcomed Masters [[K'Kruhk]] and [[Sian Jeisel]] when they arrived on Bogden 3 to make repairs to their [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. Entertaining the [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi Generals]] and their [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], Mahn and the Hawkbats threw a large feast in welcome of their comrades. As the feast concluded, however, the [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] who had accompanied the [[General/Legends|generals]] to the world received [[Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150|Contingency]] [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] from the [[Office of the Supreme Chancellor]].<ref name=\"DT6\" />\n\nThe order instructed the clones to open fire on all Jedi, stating that they had betrayed the Republic. As the clones dutifully [[Massacre on Bogden 3|took aim]] at the younglings, the Jedi Masters sprang into action. Mahn urged her students to flee, deflecting all incoming fire as K'kruhk, Jeisel, and Piru defended the younglings. Mahn [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force-pushed]] several troopers away as she attempted to cover the Initiates but was shot in the back by a trooper she had knocked down, [[Death/Legends|dying]] amidst the Hawkbats. Despite her death and that of Jeisel, K'Kruhk and Piru successfully evacuated nine students, flying them offworld.<ref name=\"DT6\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Being aware of your fear is the first step to conquering it.|A phrase Mahn often told Chase Piru|Dark Times 10}}\n[[File:Swdt6p2_edited.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Du Mahn cared for the younglings of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan.]]\nMaster Du Mahn was fair-skinned with [[Color/Legends|blue]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. She believed that to conquer fear one must first be aware of it, a lesson she would often repeat to her colleague Chase Piru. Isolated on Bogden 3 during the Clone Wars, she worried about what was happening elsewhere in the galaxy but offered [[Foodstuff/Legends|meals]] and rest to any other Jedi who visited, telling her students, whom she described as soaring, to throw a feast when K'Kruhk and Jeisel arrived at the end of the war. During Order 66 she defended the younglings to the best of her ability, giving her life in the process and urging the clan to flee with her dying breath.<ref name=\"DT6\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nWhilst working in the training facility, Mahn wore [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]] of a pale brown color, which included a veil over her head that revealed only her face. Over the robes she wore a [[Jedi utility belt|utility belt]], on which she kept her lightsaber, which was built with a green blade.<ref name=\"DT6\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDu Mahn first appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: Dark Times]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series in the [[Dark Times 6|first issue]] of the [[Star Wars: Dark Times: Parallels|''Parallels'']] story arc.
