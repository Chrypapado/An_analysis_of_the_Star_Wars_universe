When [[Vergere]] came to Zonama Sekot, he initially refused to help her, out of memory for his father, who had been expelled from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] over his beliefs in the [[Potentium]]. He was killed when his palace was destroyed when the [[Yuuzhan Vong|Far Outsiders]] launched [[First Battle of Zonama Sekot|an attack]] on the planet. However, Sekot made a mental image of the Magister to serve as Magister, until Sekot felt ready to reveal itself. Everyone (including the Magister's family) thought that he was still alive, and they did not learn the truth until the [[Second Battle of Zonama Sekot]]. When [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and one of the Magister's daughters, [[Jabitha Hal|Jabitha]], visited the ruins of the Magister's Palace, they found his withered corpse.\n\nHe had three sons and four daughters; one of the latter, Jabitha, succeeded him as Magister.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rogue Planet]]'' {{1st}} {{C|As one of [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Sekot's]] visible forms}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion]]'' {{Imo}} {{C|as second Magister and [[Jabitha Hal|Jabitha's]] father}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box|\n|title=[[Magister]] of [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]]\n|years=&mdash;[[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]]\n|before=[[Leor Hal]]\n|after=[[Jabitha Hal]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Magister no identificado\n}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Magisters of Zonama Sekot]]\n[[Category:Sekotans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified political figures]]"}}}]}}}}
