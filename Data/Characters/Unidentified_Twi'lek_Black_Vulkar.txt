Back when we had honor. Then Brejik and his followers took over and turned our gang into a bunch of violent thugs and bloodthirsty punks. Now they treat all us original Vulkars like second class citizens. Take me, for example. I used to be one of the highest ranking Vulkars in the gang. Now I'm stuck on guard duty here in the back, all thanks to Brejik!|The Vulkar, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nThis [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] was a member of the [[Taris/Legends|Tarisian]] [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkar]] [[Swoop gang|gang]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\nHe was a high-ranking member of the gang long before [[Brejik]] became leader; back when the Vulkars had honor and respect. But after Brejik and his followers took over, the gang was transformed into a group of violent thugs and the original Vulkars were demoted and ridiculed. This specific Twi'lek went from being one of the highest ranking members to a mere guard in a back room. He despised Brejik and wanted to leave, but knew that he would be killed if he tried.\n\nAt some point after the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] took over [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], the Vulkars captured the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Bastila Shan]] as well as stole a [[Prototype accelerator]] from their rivals, the [[Hidden Beks]]. Eventually, the former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and his allies invaded the Black Vulkars' base and encountered the Twi'lek. After a very brief skirmish, the gang member quickly surrendered and expressed his disgust with Brejik's rule of the gang. After telling Revan about the base's security systems, Revan spared the Twi'lek, allowing him to leave the gang for good.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Brejik knows anyone with character will never willingly follow a leader like him, so he uses brutality and violence to stay in power.|The Vulkar, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nThe player can ask the Twi'lek about Bastila Shan and the [[prototype accelerator]]. He states that Bastila is well out of the player's reach, but he will give information on the accelerator and how to bypass the systems.\n\nThe player can either kill the Twi'lek or let him go, though neither option affects the player's alignment.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0432\u0438'\u043b\u0435\u043a \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0412\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u0440\n}}\n\n[[Category:Black Vulkars]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified criminals]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
