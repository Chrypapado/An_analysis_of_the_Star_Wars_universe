In the time before Alderaan's destruction, Genden joined a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] organization that worked for [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]].\n\nIn the year [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], he ambushed a luxury liner and held the passengers hostage while demanding the release of several prisoners of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Imperial authorities refused, and Genden destroyed the liner and all 10,000 passengers. He reemerged several months after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] and took command of a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] military base. He demanded this time, the release of prisoners being held in Republic prisons, but he was driven off before any further action occurred. He managed to elude capture, and escaped to his main base in the planet [[Gormdin]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wanted by Cracken]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041b\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Genden, Lohn}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]"}}}]}}}}
