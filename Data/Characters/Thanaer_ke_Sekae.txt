After defeating ke Hanadi, ke Sekae was about to kill her to please the [[Perator]] of [[Cartann]], whom ke Hanadi insulted before the duel, when [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]] intervened and issued a challenge of his own.\n\nThe terms of the challenge were if ke Sekae killed ke Hanadi, Janson would not consent to fight him. This was considered a great insult in Adumari culture, as it meant the challenger was more interested in the conditions rather than the duel. But Janson managed to provoke ke Sekae into accepting it by playing on the new champion's pride.\n\nHaving minimal experience with a blastsword, Janson used the blastsword as a decoy and turned the duel into a fistfight, something the noble ke Sekae did not expect and had no experience. In the end, Janson dealt out significant physical damage to ke Sekae, leaving him defeated and utterly humiliated.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=/default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040401adumarmain|text=Adumar: Pilots Wanted|int=Adumar: Pilots Wanted|archivedate=20100325071306}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Thanaer ke Sekae\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ke Sekae, Thanaer}}\n[[Category:Adumari]]\n[[Category:Duelists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
