The plan was to incite the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] to attack Mos Eisley in order to pressurize the [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] and eventually take control of the city.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Dorn Gestros frequented the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in the city of [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]]. During this time, a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] named [[Anetia Kah'ryn]] tasked an [[entertainer]] with extracting information from a number of patrons, including Dorn Gestros. Anetia, a performer herself, found that patrons were more willing to divulge information after they have been entertained. Anetia desired information on criminal and Tusken activity on Tatooine, and felt Dorn Gestros might know something.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> A novice entertainer went to the Mos Espa cantina and performed for Gestros and other patrons. After the performance, Gestros complimented the entertainer. The entertainer used this opportunity to flatter Gestros, and ask him if he knew of any information. Gestros then revealed that someone was riling up the Tuskens, and that some sort of holy site was involved. The entertainer thanked Gestros for the information, and after saying their farewells, reported the information to Anetia.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:DornGestros.jpg|200px|thumb|Randomly generated depiction of Dorn Gestros]]\nDorn Gestros was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Dorn Gestros was added to the game with the release of the with the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 17 Notes for 26 May 2005|Publish 17]]\", on [[May 26]], [[2005]].<ref name=\"SWG:2005\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref> He was part of a quest given by Anetia Kah'ryn to beginner players who had chosen a career of \"[[W:c:swg:Entertainer (pre-NGE)|entertainer]]\".<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> During each server reset, his appearance was randomized, but he consistently appeared as a Human male.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Anetia Kah'ryn's quest was removed from the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]],<ref name=\"SWG:2005\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Total Experience}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Entertainer's Life (quest)|The Entertainer's Life}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gestros, Dorn}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
