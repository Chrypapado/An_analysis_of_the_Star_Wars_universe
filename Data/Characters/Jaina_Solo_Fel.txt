You are like tempered steel, purposeful and razor-keen. Always you shall be in the front rank, a burning brand to your enemies, a brilliant fire to your friends. Yours is a restless life, and never shall you know peace, though you shall be blessed for the peace that you bring to others. Take comfort in the fact that, though you stand tall and alone, others take shelter in the shadow that you cast.|[[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]|The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way}}\n'''Jaina Solo Fel''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] of the [[New Jedi Order]], member of the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi High Council]], the wife of [[Jagged Fel]], the twin sister of [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], and the older sister of [[Anakin Solo]]. Born to [[Han Solo/Legends|Han]] and [[Leia Organa Solo]], she inherited her father's mechanical aptitude and her mother's [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitivity]], resulting in her eventual training at the [[Jedi Praxeum]]. During her time there as a youth, she had many adventures, including helping to thwart the [[Second Imperium]], where she helped [[Zekk]] abandon the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] and join the ranks of the Jedi.\n\nWhen the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invaded [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], Solo joined the [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|New Republic military]] and distinguished herself as a [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]]. She was constantly on the front lines of battle during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], earning the title of [[Sword of the Jedi]] from her uncle, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and becoming known as an avatar of the Trickster Goddess [[Yun-Harla]] to the Yuuzhan Vong. During the war, she also became romantically involved with fellow pilot [[Jagged Fel]]. However, the death of her brother Anakin caused Solo to walk dangerously close to the dark side. She was later redeemed with the aid of [[Kyp Durron]]. As the war waged on, Solo discovered a way for the reformed [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] to use Yuuzhan Vong [[Warship/Legends|warships]] and [[biot]]s to their advantage, and also personally slew [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]] in the [[Battle of Ebaq]]. Solo fought in many of the war's battles, ultimately participating in its [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|conclusion]]. Solo, as a survivor of the [[Mission to Myrkr]], later became [[Joiner|Joined]] into the [[Killik/Legends|Killik]] community, and was involved in the subsequent [[Dark Nest Crisis]] and [[Swarm War]] on the side of the Killiks against the Chiss, which strained her relationship with Jagged Fel.\n\nIn [[40 ABY]], she assumed control of [[Hardpoint Squadron]] and participated in the [[Battle of Tralus (Second Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Tralus]], siding with the Galactic Alliance. Afterward, she and her brother Jacen commanded [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] during the [[Blockade of Corellia]]. The resulting [[Second Galactic Civil War|crisis]] resulted in a split between her and Jacen due to his increasingly aggressive actions, though she remained active in the Jedi Order. Solo would later be paired up with Jagged Fel and Zekk on a mission to hunt down the renegade [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Alema Rar]]. The death of her aunt [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] and the dark deeds of her brother only encouraged her to find a way to stop Jacen, who had fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and she began seeking the means to do so through training with her father's ex-arch-enemy, [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. She later killed her twin brother, now the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] Darth Caedus, in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]] aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']].\n\nFollowing her brother's death, Solo remained an active member of the Order. As such, when [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Natasi Daala]] [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] her uncle, Luke Skywalker, from the New Jedi Order as the beginning of a bid to take control of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Solo created a covert group, [[Darkmeld]], as a means of secretly undermining Daala's efforts. Daala's increasing extremism prompted the Order to lead a [[Plan Delta|coup]] to remove Daala from power. Following that, Solo joined her uncle in [[Operation Shieldfall|fighting]] against both an [[Lost Tribe of Sith|emerging Sith threat]] and a dark side entity known as [[Abeloth]]. When the Sith and Abeloth took control of the government on Coruscant, Solo joined her uncle and many of the other Jedi in an infiltration and [[Liberation of Coruscant (Lost Tribe of Sith emergence)|surprise assault]] on the occupiers. Solo was confirmed as a Jedi Master by her uncle during this struggle. Following the destruction of Abeloth and the end of the Sith threat, Jaina Solo married the Imperial Jagged Fel, whom she had reconnected with during the Second Galactic Civil War.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood (9 ABY&ndash;22 ABY)===\n====Birth====\n[[File:LeiaTwins.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jaina as an infant with her [[Leia Organa Solo|mother]] and [[Darth Caedus|twin brother]].]]\n{{Quote|Mom and Dad never act that weird unless they're worried about us three little darlings.''\"<br />\"''That's for sure. They sure do worry.''\"<br />\"''Come on, Jacen. If you were our parents, wouldn't ''you'' worry?|Jaina and Jacen Solo discuss their parents|Ambush at Corellia}}\nEven before they were born, Solo and her twin brother Jacen, along with their mother, were subject to three kidnapping attempts by [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] [[Noghri Death Commando]]s. In order to entice the mad [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Joruus C'baoth]] into helping him with his [[Thrawn campaign|campaign]], Thrawn had made a promise to apprehend [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Leia Organa Solo]], and her as yet unborn children&mdash;[[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] individuals that C'baoth could then corrupt and mold in any way that he saw fit once he got his hands on them.<ref name=\"Last Command\" />\n\nAfter a visit to the blighted world of [[Honoghr/Legends|Honoghr]] and securing the allegiance of the [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]], Leia ensured that Solo and her twin brother were born on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during the final days of the Thrawn campaign without the threat of any more kidnapping attempts by Noghri Death Commandos hanging over their heads. Thrawn, however, still trying to keep his end of the bargain, sent [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] agents to Coruscant to kidnap the twins and their mother once again. The quarters in which the [[House of Solo|Solo family]] lived were destroyed, but Thrawn's agents once again were foiled and the twins were unharmed.<ref name=\"Last Command\" />\n\n====Isolation====\nDespite the reassurances of ancient Jedi lore that held that childish innocence was an effective obstacle to the corrupting influence of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], Solo's uncle Luke Skywalker believed that any contact with the dark side could warp the mind of a young child for the rest of his or her life. Given the Force potential in the twins, Luke told Solo's parents that he felt it was best to minimize any chance for the twins to be exposed to the dark side during this vulnerable time.<ref name=\"Dark Empire II\" />\n\n[[File:Winterbaby.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jaina and Jacen in the care of [[Winter Celchu|Winter]], with [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] watching closely.]]\nThey took his advice and sent the twins to [[New Alderaan/Legends|New Alderaan]], to be under the care of Leia's lifelong friend and aide [[Winter Celchu|Winter]]. Any safety that could be derived from this arrangement would be short-lived, however. The [[Cloning/Legends|reborn]] [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] discovered New Alderaan's location and ordered an attack on the planet immediately. During the chaos of the [[Battle of New Alderaan (Operation Shadow Hand)|attack on New Alderaan]], Solo and her brother were nearly kidnapped by [[Dark Side Elite|Darksiders]] [[Xecr Nist]] and [[Kvag Gthull]], but their efforts were thwarted by the actions of a group of Jedi warriors led by Skywalker.<ref name=\"Dark Empire II\" />\n\nFollowing the battle, the Solo twins were brought to the ancient space city of [[Nespis VIII]], where their parents and uncle discovered that the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] had survived the [[Destruction of Da Soocha V|destruction]] of [[Da Soocha V]]. After the birth of their younger brother, Anakin, the Solo twins lived with their mother and father in the space city until they fled with the rest of the New Republic forces, shortly before the city was itself [[Destruction of the Nespis VIII spaceport|destroyed]] by one of the [[Galaxy Gun]]'s warheads.<ref name=\"Dark Empire II\" />''\n\nHeeding Luke's advice, Han and Leia took all three Solo children into hiding on the world of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] so that the future of the Jedi would be protected from Palpatine, who planned to [[Transfer essence|spiritually enter]] Anakin and free himself from his last clone body, which was deteriorating at an alarming rate. Han and Leia made their way to Onderon, but Palpatine, using a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[oracle stone]], was able to determine their destination and intercept the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. The ''Falcon'' was damaged in the ensuing confrontation, but Han and his [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] comrade [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] managed to coax it into limping all the way to Onderon, where they landed it in the city of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]].<ref name=\"Dark Empire II\" />\n\nWith Palpatine hot on their heels, aged Jedi [[Vima-Da-Boda]] and Chewbacca attempted to create a diversion, with the goal of making Palpatine think that Leia and the children had fled Onderon aboard the ''Falcon''. Meanwhile, the three children embarked on a day-long journey to [[Kira Fortress|Fortress Kira]] with their parents. Palpatine did not fall for the ruse and managed to track his quarry right to the room where Leia and her children were staying.<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]''</ref>\n\nJaina and Jacen could do little more but look on as their parents, uncle, the Jedi [[Empatojayos Brand]], and [[Ysanna/Legends|Ysanna]] warrior [[Rayf Ysanna]] battled Palpatine's last clone. At the cost of the lives of Ysanna and Brand, Palpatine was thwarted in his attempt to possess Anakin's body.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> After the New Republic had reclaimed Coruscant, Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo were relocated to the isolated and nearly unknown world of [[Anoth/Legends|Anoth]] with Winter, where they once again rarely saw their parents.<ref name=\"Jedi Search\">''[[Jedi Search]]''</ref>\n\n====Reunion====\n{{Quote|Where's Jaina!?|Han Solo, after Jaina disappeared|Star Wars: Chewbacca (Dark Horse)}}\nWhen they were two-and-a-half years old, the twins returned to Coruscant to live with their parents. By this time, Solo and her brother demonstrated an [[Telekinesis/Legends|ability to move objects with their minds]] from time to time.<ref name=\"Dark Apprentice\">[[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']]</ref> They also further developed the mental bond that they had been born with, and had a tendency to use it to complete each other's sentences as well as coordinate their misbehavior. Because Solo's parents had been able to visit Anoth only a few times, the twins became quite apprehensive about leaving Winter (whom they had come to view as their mother) for the care of their mother, whom they viewed as a stranger.<ref name=\"Jedi Search\" />\n\n[[File:Chewbacca_Jaina.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaina getting into trouble as a child.]]\nBecause her husband was gone at the time that the twins returned, Leia Solo found herself struggling to balance her motherly duties with her responsibilities as [[Minister of State]] of the New Republic. As a result, Leia enlisted the help of the family's [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], who was eager to put his recently-downloaded child-rearing subroutines to the test. C-3PO accepted the job with an initial enthusiasm, but found himself overwhelmed on a number of occasions, including one incident in which the twins caused him to become entangled within a [[tentacle-cactus]] during a diplomatic ceremony in the [[Skydome Botanical Gardens]]. He also put his storytelling abilities to use, and took pride in his ability to sing lullabies in just about any language or style. More often than not, though, the twins preferred their father's telling of ''[[The Little Lost Bantha Cub]]'' more than the droid's renditions.<ref name=\"Jedi Search\" />\n\nAfter he returned with Han Solo from their mission to [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]], Chewbacca assisted C-3PO with the care of Solo and her brother while their parents attended to other responsibilities. In the first instance when the pair was tasked with taking care of the twins in their parents' absence, the twins' pestering managed to drive Chewbacca into a frenzy, and even deteriorate C-3PO's patience programming. The [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] and the protocol droid decided that it would be a good idea to bring the twins on a field trip to Coruscant's [[Holographic Zoo of Extinct Animals]]. They quickly tired of the dullness of the museum and decided that a game of hide-and-seek with their escorts would be much more fun.<ref name=\"Dark Apprentice\" />\n\nWithout informing C-3PO and Chewbacca, Solo and her brother Jacen began their game. Evading Chewbacca's pursuit, the twins found their way onto a [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]] and rode it down to the floor designated as \"1.\" Exiting from the turbolift, the twins embarked upon an adventure in [[Coruscant underworld|Coruscant's undercity]] where they encountered many unfamiliar creatures. They eventually discovered [[Daykim's Kingdom|a refugee community]] that consisted of accountants who had fled the oppression of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] on Coruscant's surface. Despite his fear of the Empire&mdash;which he thought was still in power on Coruscant&mdash;[[King/Legends|King]] [[Onibald Daykim]] of the refugees helped the two children return to their home.<ref name=\"Dark Apprentice\" />\n\n====Trip to the Jedi Praxeum====\n{{Quote|Help, help! Uncle Luke needs help.|Jaina rousing the Jedi trainees to save her uncle|Champions of the Force}}\nIn [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], Solo and her twin brother accompanied their parents to the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] when it was learned that their uncle Luke Skywalker had been found in a coma-like state on the top of the [[Great Temple/Legends|Great Temple]] by his students. Although the medical team had been unsuccessful in reviving the Jedi Master, Solo believed that she could somehow awaken him from his deep sleep by kissing him, but was similarly unsuccessful. Later, the twins, along with their mother and the students, felt a great [[Wound in the Force|disturbance in the Force]] as the [[Carida system/Legends|Carida system]] was destroyed by the rogue Jedi [[Kyp Durron]]&mdash;who, with the help of the [[Force ghost|spirit]] of an ancient [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] named [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], had also sent Skywalker into his comatose state.<ref name=\"Champions of the Force\">''[[Champions of the Force]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Solo_Family_The_Other.jpg|thumb|right|Jaina with her family.]]\nThe twins remained on Yavin 4, watching over their comatose relative. One night, they were able to keep their uncle's body from being destroyed by Jedi trainee [[Streen]], who had been deceived by Kun's spirit, after Luke appeared to them in a dream. When visiting Luke's body with the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] healer [[Cilghal]], who was taking care of the twins after their parents left the Praxeum, the two younger Solos discovered that&mdash;unlike the adults at the Praxeum&mdash;they could see their uncle's disembodied spirit. When a group of Sith [[Battle hydra/Legends|battle hydras]] were sent by Kun to attack Luke's body, the Jedi's spirit warned the twins again. After raising the alarm with Cilghal, Solo went to the audience chamber where Luke was lying, was greeted by the sight of her brother defending Luke's body with Luke's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], and rushed to his aid.<ref name=\"Champions of the Force\" />\n\nThe twins were able to hold off the vicious creatures until help arrived. Luke's students then formed a plan to end the threat presented by Exar Kun once and for all. After helping the students [[Force Light|combine their powers]] and vanquish the ancient Sith Lord, the two children were delighted to see their uncle recover.<ref name=\"Champions of the Force\" />\n\nAfter Anakin came perilously close to being kidnapped by pro-Imperial [[Ambassador/Legends|Ambassador]] [[Furgan]] on Anoth, Leia and Han Solo decided that he, along with Winter, would join his brother and sister on Coruscant. Because of their mother's increased diplomatic responsibilities as [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] of the New Republic, the three Solo children found themselves attending&mdash;and causing mischief at&mdash;important diplomatic ceremonies such as the [[Concert of the Winds]] on [[Vortex/Legends|Vortex]]<ref name=\"Dark Apprentice\" /> and the [[Herd Meet]] on [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]].<ref name=\"Children of the Jedi\">[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']]</ref>\n\nWhen Solo was around four years old, she accompanied her father and brothers on a trip with Chewbacca. While her father had his hands full with her brothers, she wandered off, following a robotic hand. She eventually found a droid who wanted to turn her to the dark side. Fortunately, Chewbacca was able to destroy the droid and rescue Solo. To thank him, she drew him a picture saying that she loved him.<ref name=\"Chewbacca\">[[Star Wars: Chewbacca (Dark Horse)|''Star Wars: Chewbacca'']]</ref>\n\nAs Solo grew older, she took after her father, seeming to acquire his cockiness and piloting skills as well as a certain aptitude for all things mechanical, which made him proud of her. At the age of five, Solo was allowed to have her own multitool, which she was allowed to use on wood&mdash;though in the workshop only.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\">''[[The Crystal Star]]''</ref> At seven, Solo had one that worked on metal. Finally, at the age of nine, Han felt that Solo was responsible enough to help him with simple repairs and also allowed her to fly the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"DB\" /> There were a few occasions when Solo was overzealous with her attempts at mechanical innovation, such as the time when she and her brothers constructed a faulty droid to do their housework, or the many times that they had \"experimented\" with their Uncle Luke's lightsaber.\n\nSolo did not become as close to her mother as she was to her father, and there was an emotional divide between them. Though Leia Solo tried to be in her daughter's life as much as possible, the ever-increasing burdens of duties to the New Republic continually pulled her away from her family. Solo noticed this more and more as she grew older, and grew to resent it.<ref name=\"DB\"\n />\n\n====Abduction attempts====\n{{Quote|Remember what happened? We were playing with Chewie&ndash;''\"<br />\"''&ndash;and then he jumped up&ndash;''\"<br />\"''&ndash;and then he fell down&ndash;''\"<br />\"''&ndash;and then I went to sleep.''\"<br />\"''Me too.|Jaina, Jacen and Anakin|The Crystal Star}}\n[[File:ThreepioAndSoloTwins-EE2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] minding Jacen and Jaina Solo]]\nIn [[13 ABY/Legends|13 ABY]], the Solo children were living in the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. While there, the three children snuck into a Council meeting even though they had been told the area was off-limits, diverting their mother's attention at the expense of a diplomatic envoy. After the council was adjourned, Leia Organa Solo called for [[Nanna]], their droid babysitter who they had previously eluded, to take charge of them. Nanna led them away, threatening chores as punishment for their misbehavior.<ref name=\"Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 1\">[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 1|''Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost'' 1]]</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, a group of assassins under the command of a hardline ex-Imperial named [[Ennix Devian]] attempted to kidnap Organa Solo and her children in the night. Organa Solo's chief of security [[Mirith Sinn]], along with Organa Solo and her Noghri bodyguards, slew the assassins, but the attack greatly worried Organa Solo. A pair of Noghri escorted the twins to their mother, who instructed that they be taken to her room, where she would join them shortly, and guarded well.<ref name=\"Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 2\">[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 2|''Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost'' 2]]</ref> Later, the Solo children would be able to speak to their father, who was away at war, via holocomm, reassuring him that they were unharmed by the kidnapping attempt.<ref name=\"Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 3\">[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 3|''Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost'' 3]]</ref>\n\nThe next year, during a visit to the planet [[Munto Codru/Legends|Munto Codru]] when she was five years old, Solo and her brothers were kidnapped along with [[Codru-Ji]] [[Chamberlain/Legends|Chamberlain]] [[Iyon]]'s [[wyrwulf]]. The abductors used the dark side of the Force to mask their presence, and a [[pressure bomb]] to destroy any evidence as well as to unsuccessfully attempt to kill Chewbacca. As they left the atmosphere of Munto Codru, the three children left behind a trail of pain that could be sensed in the Force by their mother.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\" />\n\nAfter they returned to consciousness, the Solo children were greeted by a man named [[Hethrir]]. He claimed that their parents, their uncle, and Chewbacca had been killed in an [[Groundquake/Legends|earthquake]] and that he, Hethrir, was their [[Hold-Parent|hold-father]]. The twins determined that Hethrir was lying, since their uncle and their father had not been on Munto Codru at the time that they were kidnapped, and confirmed their suspicions by getting Hethrir to incorrectly state the twins' birth order, disproving his claims of being present at their birth. In truth, Hethrir was part of the [[Empire Reborn]], a movement aiming to destroy the New Republic.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\" />\n\nThe twins were imprisoned in Hethrir's [[Worldcraft]], though usually separated when not in their cells, while Anakin was kept with Hethrir at all times. Though behaving in a manner amenable to the rules would guarantee her more privileges as an Empire Reborn [[Helpers|Helper]] and eventually a [[Proctor (Empire Reborn)|Proctor]], Solo attempted to be as rude and uncooperative to her superiors at every turn, even using the Force to put sand in their food, while Jacen sent [[myrmin]] insects to harass them. Despite the drudgery of living in such a situation, Solo found a friend in [[Lusa]], a female [[Chironian]] who had also been kidnapped. However, Solo soon found that her new friend, along with Anakin and the wyrwulf, was to be taken away.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\" />\n\nAn unpleasant encounter with a fully-indoctrinated [[Empire Youth]] named [[Vram]] further convinced Solo that she and her brother needed to escape Hethrir's Worldcraft. Using a [[multitool]] that she had hidden from Hethrir's Helpers and Proctors, Solo managed to disable the latch of her cell's door. She quickly freed Jacen and then the other children, and they made their way out of the building in which their cells were housed. With the help of [[Mistress Dragon]]&mdash;a [[Sand dragon/Legends|sand dragon]] that Jacen had earlier [[Animal bond|befriended]]&mdash;the children escaped Hethrir's compound into the \"wilderness\" of the worldcraft with a group of Proctors in pursuit.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\" />\n\nAs the Proctors drew closer, Leia arrived in her star yacht [[Alderaan (yacht)|''Alderaan'']] with Chewbacca and a woman named [[Rillao]] and rescued them, but Hethrir had already left with Anakin. The twins accompanied the adults to [[Crseih Station]], where Hethrir planned to sacrifice their younger brother to a mysterious entity known as [[Waru]] and auction off Lusa, the wyrwulf, and a number of other children as [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]]. As they neared [[Temple of Waru|Waru's temple]] aboard the station, Leia told the twins to stay with Chewbacca while she ventured inside with Han. Han and Luke had also made their way to the station separately from Leia and the children. When Solo and her brother heard what they thought to be cries of distress from Lusa and the wyrwulf, they convinced Chewbacca to enter the temple to help them. After a confrontation with Luke, Han, and Leia, and deprived of Anakin's power, Waru destroyed Hethrir and itself.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\" />\n\nAfter the confrontation with Hethrir and Waru, life returned to some resemblance of normality for Solo and her brothers. The kidnapping, however, caused Solo's parents to become much more protective of their children, with Han refusing to let his children out of his sight. Though they were insulated from any harm that might come to them, the Solo children were also protected from having any friends outside their parents, uncle, Chewbacca, Winter, C-3PO, and R2-D2. And though she had found a friend in Lusa while she was imprisoned aboard the worldcraft, Solo lost contact with the Chironian after she returned to her home planet of [[Chiron (planet)|Chiron]].<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\" />\n\nUnlike their younger brother, the twins often devised new and sophisticated ways to test their father's patience. Jacen became less willing to play with his sister, however, choosing instead to focus on developing his ability to use the Force to levitate objects. Solo became annoyed by this behavior, and started to disrupt his practice. Despite the vexation that she gave their father, she loved him, and was angered by the prospect of losing him when the news was broken to her that he had been captured by the [[Duskhan League]] during the [[Black Fleet Crisis]], despite Leia's attempts to shield the children from the news of their father's incarceration.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\">''[[Tyrant's Test]]''</ref>\n\n====Corellian Crisis====\n{{Quote|Our cousin is a bad man.|Jaina, describing her cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo|Ambush at Corellia}}\n[[File:YoungJaina.jpg|thumb|right|Jaina around the time of the Corellian Crisis.]]\nIn [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]], Jaina Solo accompanied her family on a vacation to the [[Corellian system]]. Upon their arrival, Leia hired a [[Drall/Legends|Drall]] named [[Ebrihim]] as a tutor for the children and a guide for the whole family, though the twins were unenthusiastic about their new tutor.<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\">''[[Ambush at Corellia]]''</ref>\n\nOn their first outing, the family visited [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia's]] first major archaeological site, an excavation. While touring the tunnels of the excavation, Solo noticed that Anakin had stopped following the rest of the tour, and had become fascinated with a section of the tunnel's floor. Along with Jacen, they continued off in a different direction, and the three of them eventually stumbled upon what was later identified as Corellia's [[planetary repulsor]], one of which was located in each of the [[Five Brothers]].<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\" />\n\nThe children were soon found by Ebrihim's [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Q9-X2]], who alone had noticed that the children had gone missing. Realizing that the chamber was what the [[Human League Heritage Squad]] that had been conducting the dig was looking for, and that it would not be beneficial to the New Republic if the xenophobic group found it, the twins then used the Force to cover up any sign that the group had been there. Solo, her brothers, and Q9-X2 eventually were reunited with their parents and later told them about what they had found there.<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\" />\n\nAfter several days, Solo and her family relocated their lodgings to the [[Governor/Legends|Governor-General's]] residence at [[Corona House/Legends|Corona House]], where they met Governor-General [[Micamberlecto]]. There, Leia and Han were scheduled to attend a major trade conference designed to bring the Corellian system back into the galactic fold. On the first night of the conference, the children stayed up late and spied on the adults, learning about an threat to destroy planets from an unknown group if their demands were not met.<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\" />\n\nThe three Solo children were eventually cooped up in Corona House with Chewbacca, Ebrihim, and Q9-X2, while their parents left to advise Micamberlecto. They watched from their apartment as enclaves within Coronet City burned to the ground and bodies piled up in the streets in the first stages of what was later known as the [[Corellian Crisis]].<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\" />\n\nCorona House came under fire, so the children, the Wookiee, the Drall, and the droid piled into the ''Falcon'' to make a hasty retreat. With the freighter's [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] damaged by a [[PB-950 patrol boat|pocket patrol boat's]] fire, they journeyed to the [[Marcha's Estate|home]] of Ebrihim's Aunt [[Marcha]] on [[Drall (planet)|Drall]]. Solo and her brothers were well received by Marcha, the [[Duke/Legends|Duchess]] of [[Mastigophorous]]. The following morning, the children told Marcha what had transpired before they were forced to leave Corellia. Solo also told Marcha about what she and her siblings had witnessed on the first night of the conference, feeling that Anakin's discovery and the ominous message were somehow connected.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\">''[[Assault at Selonia]]''</ref>\n\nMarcha brought the children, Chewbacca, Ebrihim, and Q9-X2 to Drall's planetary repulsor. They made their way inside the repulsor and watched as Anakin experimented and, in one instance, activated the repulsor, nearly killing everyone there. Though she was annoyed by the fact that Anakin had almost killed her, Jaina understood that it was pointless to make her feelings known and instead tried to comfort her guilt-stricken sibling.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\nSolo and her brothers were later captured by their father's cousin [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]], who had come to claim the repulsor for the [[Human League]], and imprisoned Solo, her brothers, Chewbacca, Ebrihim, and Marcha. The [[Hidden Leader|leader of the Human League]] broadcast images of the captive children to the rest of the Corellian system to blackmail their mother into getting the New Republic to recognize Corellian independence. This action, however, turned the tide of public opinion in the system against the Human League.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\">''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''</ref>\n\nThe twins managed to escape from their [[Force field/Legends|force field]] prison with Anakin, and made it to the ''Falcon'' undetected. Because they had to leave the adults behind, Solo and Jacen assumed the roles of pilot and co-pilot, respectively. Before they flew the ''Falcon'' out of the repulsor chamber, Solo destroyed the force field generator and tried to damage the Human League's [[Mynock-class assault boat|''Mynock''-class assault boat]] as much as possible, but was largely unsuccessful. Ascending into the sky, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was closely pursued by the assault boat with Thrackan at the helm.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />'\n\nThough he had no experience at flying the freighter and was flying it upside down, Jacen managed to outmaneuver the assault boat and ended up tailing it. Seizing the opportunity, Solo destroyed its [[Sublight drive|sublight]] engine array, causing the assault boat to hang dead in space. Immediately thereafter the ''Falcon'' was caught in a [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]]. Although the children initially assumed the worst, the voice of Lando Calrissian came to them over the communications system, reassuring them that there was no need to panic, as the tractor beam belonged to the [[Bakura/Legends|Bakuran]] vessel [[Intruder (Namana-class)|''Intruder'']], which had arrived to support the New Republic movement in the Corellian system.<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />\n\nAboard the ''Intruder'', the Solo children were reunited with their parents, but were parted once again because Han and Leia had volunteered to help the Bakuran fleet in its confrontation with the forces of the [[Sacorrian Triad]], the masterminds of the planet-destroying ultimatum, at [[Centerpoint Station]]. The twins accompanied their brother back to the planetary repulsor on Drall to see if he could find a way to use it to stop the ancient space station from continuing its destruction of whole [[Star system/Legends|star systems]].<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />\n\nOnce they were inside the planetary repulsor again, Solo and Jacen tried to help the technicians to understand their little brother, despite their own thinning patience. As the critical firing time approached, Solo encouraged Anakin to trust his feelings and reach out with the Force. Anakin did so and fired the repulsor, saving the lives of the twelve million inhabitants of [[Bovo Yagen (planet)|Bovo Yagen]].<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" />\n\nDuring that same year on Coruscant, the Solo twins befriended a street kid named [[Zekk]]. Though he had a tendency to disappear unexpectedly back to the alleys, Zekk and the two Solo twins became fast friends, and Zekk took the twins on many adventures throughout the city. Solo eventually found herself developing a crush on him.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest]]''</ref>\n\n====Caamas Document Crisis====\n[[File:Union_Jaina.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jaina around the time of the Caamas Document Crisis in [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]].]]\n{{Quote|They're really getting married?

The next day they discovered that the object was a solar panel from a [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighter]] that had crashed more than [[0 BBY/Legends|twenty years prior]]. Solo decided to fix the ship and install a hyperdrive which had been given to her as a gift by her father. She began working on the damaged fighter with help from Jacen, Lowbacca, and Tenel Ka. Unfortunately for the young Jedi apprentices, the TIE's original pilot, [[Qorl]], was still alive, and had lived the last twenty-three years in Yavin 4's jungles. After kidnapping Jaina and Jacen, Qorl forced them to finish repairing his ship so he could escape his exile at long last. The twins eventually escaped due to the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} arrival, but so did Qorl, leaving the jungle moon behind and searching for any remnants of the Empire.<ref name=\"Heirs of the Force\" /> Qorl would discover the [[Shadow Academy]], a training ground for Dark Jedi under the command of one of Luke Skywalker's fallen students, [[Brakiss]], and the [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] [[Tamith Kai]]. The Shadow Academy was aligned with the [[Second Imperium]],<ref name=\"YJK:The Shadow Academy\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Shadow Academy]]''</ref> an insurgency group which rejected the peace treaty between the [[Imperial Remnant]] and the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] in [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]].{{Fact}}\n\n[[File:JainaIsAMan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina and Jacen during the Shadow Academy Crisis.]]\nDuring a field trip to [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian's]] [[GemDiver Station]], the twins and Lowbacca were kidnapped by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] led by Tamith Kai. En route to their kidnappers' secret base, the twins and Lowbacca were brought to the cockpit of the ship that had been used to board GemDiver Station. Here, they were reunited with Qorl, who told them that he had found \"[his] Empire\" and that the kidnapping of the young Jedi Knights was the result of the information that he had given to his masters. After reversion to realspace, Tamith Kai told Jaina, Jacen and Lowbacca that they would be trained to become Dark Jedi once they arrived at their destination&mdash;the Shadow Academy.<ref name=\"YJK:The Shadow Academy\" />\n\nBrakiss greeted the trio of Jedi trainees and informed them of his plans for converting them. After a particularly disastrous lecture, Solo experienced the power of [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] firsthand for defying Brakiss. Brakiss knew that the new recruits were wise to his propaganda, so he decided to try to turn the twins by giving them what they desired.<ref name=\"YJK:The Shadow Academy\" />\n\nIn one training exercise, Brakiss pitted an unknowing Solo against her brother Jacen by concealing each of them with hologram devices that made them think that the other was [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. In another exercise, she and Jacen were injured when hardballs, rocks and knives were thrown at them. After they survived this exercise, Brakiss announced to them that he was so pleased with their potential that he had decided to kidnap more Jedi trainees. Luckily for Solo, she was rescued by Jacen, who had used a [[Corusca gem/Legends|Corusca gem]] from the GemDiver Station to get out of his cell. Using Lowbacca's computer expertise, they sabotaged the Shadow Academy's security systems and attempted to flee just as Luke Skywalker and Tenel Ka arrived to rescue them. However, a clean escape was blocked by Brakiss and Tamith Kai. During a confrontation, Luke defeated his former student while Tenel Ka injured Tamith Kai's knee. The group then escaped the Academy in the stolen ship ''[[Shadow Chaser]]''. Consequently, the Shadow Academy fled into hyperspace. After returning safely back to Yavin 4, the Solo twins, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca resumed life at the Praxeum.<ref name=\"YJK:The Shadow Academy\" />\n\nShortly after their kidnapping, the friends returned to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for a month-long vacation from the Jedi Praxeum's strenuous curriculum. The twins, as well as Lowbacca and Tenel Ka, spent their first day back home with Zekk, who took them along on an adventure through the [[Coruscant underworld|Coruscant Underworld]]. After a run-in with the street gang known as the [[Lost Ones]] and its leader, [[Norys]], they managed to make it back to the apartment that Zekk shared with his old friend [[Peckhum]].<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones]]''</ref>\n\nThe twins convinced Zekk to attend a diplomatic banquet that was going to be held in the honor of the new [[Karnak Alphan]] ambassador within the next couple of days. Zekk accepted, and he showed up at the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]] at the proper time, though shabbily dressed. Not knowing anything about the formal dinner, he inadvertently ate the decoration in front of him. His resulting embarrassment later caused him to flee.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones\" />\n\nAfter Peckhum described to them some of the places where Zekk might hide himself, Jacen and Tenel Ka ventured into the undercity by themselves while Solo helped repair the [[Orbital Solar Energy Transfer Satellite]] that Peckhum was assigned to. After returning, Jacen contacted his sister, told her about his encounter with Zekk and the fact that the Shadow Academy was conducting operations on Coruscant&mdash;and that Zekk was allied with the Shadow Academy. Shortly afterward, Solo realized that the Academy was in orbit over Coruscant, and the Second Imperium was forced to flee once again.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones\" />\n\nThe incident brought the vacation of the Jedi to a close, and they returned to Yavin 4. Because combat with the Dark Jedi was imminent, Luke Skywalker decided that it was time for the Solo twins, Lowbacca, and Tenel Ka to build and train with their own lightsabers. Like her uncle had done years earlier, Solo created a [[synthetic lightsaber crystal]], which created a purple blade when placed inside a lightsaber. Following an accident in which Tenel Ka lost her left arm, Solo and her companions journeyed to Tenel Ka's homeworld of [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]] so that the wounded girl could recover. While there, Solo and her companions helped defeat a revolution to overthrow Tenel Ka's mother [[Teneniel Djo]].<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:JainaVsZekk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jaina duels Zekk as the Jedi Praxeum is attacked by the Shadow Academy.]]\n\nHowever, the somewhat dormant Shadow Academy would reappear to plague the young Jedi once again. Zekk was forced to fight the Solo twins several times, and Solo was worried about the young man she considered more than just a friend. She constantly tried to bring Zekk to the light side but was initially unable to succeed.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers\" />\n\nAfter Hapes, the Jedi companions traveled to Kashyyyk, the homeworld of Lowbacca, where his younger sister [[Sirrakuk]] was about to undergo a Wookiee ritual. Since the ritual was dangerous, Lowbacca wanted to assist his sibling. Unfortunately for the young Jedi Knights, a Second Imperium strike force led by Zekk himself attacked [[Thikkiiana City/Legends|Thikkiiana City]] a major exporter of computer technology, using holographic devices to mimic Wookiees. The four Jedi trainees were able to defeat most of the Imperium soldiers. During the confrontation, Solo confronted their former friend Zekk in the dangerous lower levels of the world-spanning jungle. However, Zekk did not want to harm his former friends and instead warned them to stay away from the Imperium's next target: the Jedi Praxeum itself.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Darkest Knight\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Darkest Knight]]''</ref>\n\nIn response, the four Jedi raced back to the Jedi Praxeum to alert the Jedi there. The Shadow Academy and a fleet of reclaimed Imperial warships appeared in orbit shortly afterward. Legions of stormtroopers and Dark Jedi [[Third Battle of Yavin|attacked]] the Praxeum. The twins, with the assistance of their peers at the Jedi Academy, defeated the Second Imperium forces. Near the end of the battle, Zekk and Solo engaged each other in combat, with Solo trying one last time to turn her friend back to the light. However, Zekk seemed lost, as he claimed that he would stop anyone from entering the Jedi Praxeum. However, immediately after, the academy was engulfed in a titanic explosion. Zekk had saved the Jedi from certain destruction, and it seemed that Solo had, if not turned her friend to the light side, at least turned him away from the dark.<ref name=\"[[Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Under Siege]]\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Under Siege]]''</ref>\n\n====Diversity Alliance====\n{{Quote|Okay, hit it, Lowie. As I always say, show me&mdash;don't tell me.|Jaina Solo, to [[Lowbacca]]|Young Jedi Knights: The Emperor's Plague}}\nFollowing the defeat of the Second Imperium, the Solo twins helped rebuild the Academy, and also continued their Jedi training. While the reformed Zekk recovered from his injuries, he was harassed by nightmares as a result of his involvement with the Dark Jedi. As a result, Zekk refused to use the Force again, and left the Academy on Peckhum's freighter ''[[Lightning Rod]]'' to become a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. However, trouble would soon come when fellow student Raynar Thul received word that his father [[Bornan Thul]]&mdash;a wealthy merchant and shipping baron&mdash;had disappeared while en route to an important trade conference with [[Nolaa Tarkona]], the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] leader of the [[Diversity Alliance]], a fanatical non-Human group which sought to punish [[Human/Legends|Humans]] for the cruelty inflicted by the [[Humanocentrism|humanocentric]] Galactic Empire. Since she was a Twi'lek, Tarkona's organization was based on the species' homeworld of [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]]. When Tarkona learned that Bornan Thul had disappeared, she placed a huge bounty on the man for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the Solo twins had traveled to the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]] to search through the [[The Graveyard|asteroid field]] that had once been [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. The twins landed on a barren asteroid and secured a shard from what used to be the planet's core. However, they were ambushed by [[Ailyn Vel]], disguised as the infamous bounty hunter [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. Luckily for them, Zekk came to the rescue and drove the Fett impersonator away. Despite having rescued them, Zekk refused to return with them to the Academy, although he had decided to involve himself in the search for Bornan Thul.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan\" />\n\n[[File:JacenJaina-PlagueStorehouse-YJK11.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina and Jacen during the search for Bornan Thul.]]\nDuring their hunt, the Solo twins were joined by Raynar Thul, Tenel Ka and Lowbacca. They searched the elder Thul's last known locations, searching everywhere from ancient ruined worlds to the droid foundry planet of [[Mechis III/Legends|Mechis III]]. Meanwhile, Nolaa Tarkona went on a crusade to whip up support among the alien species of the galaxy, particularly the [[Chroman]]s of [[Chroma Zed]]. Things went poorly for the Jedi when Lowbacca misguidedly joined the Diversity Alliance, under the influence of fellow Wookiee [[Raabakyysh]], and traveled to their headquarters on Ryloth to learn more about them.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance]]''</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Zekk had rescued Bornan Thul from bounty hunters, and learned the reason he had disappeared. Thul had stumbled upon the location of a top-secret [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Emperor's plague storehouse|plague warehouse]] on an uncharted asteroid in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]]. Hidden within it was a supply of diseases created by [[General/Legends|General]] [[Evir Derricote]] almost two decades ago. Though the Galactic Empire had been defeated, this plague warehouse still remained with its supplies of diseases. Bornan also revealed that Boba Fett (actually Ailyn Vel) had sliced into his ship's navicomputer and obtained the coordinates of the plague warehouse. Having acquired the information she wanted, Tarkona now wished to unleash a plague that would affect all [[Human/Legends|Humans]].<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Delusions of Grandeur\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Delusions of Grandeur]]''</ref>\n\nRealizing that Lowbacca only knew the public face of the Diversity Alliance, the Solo twins, along with Raynar and Tenel Ka, traveled to Ryloth, only to be arrested by the local authorities and put to work in the dangerous [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] mines of Ryloth. However, Lowbacca soon learned what had befallen his Human companions. The enraged Wookiee turned against the Diversity Alliance and helped his friends escape the harsh terrain of the planet and the zealous Diversity Alliance troops. The Jedi also discovered that the Diversity Alliance was stockpiling weapons for an impending war against Humans. The group was eventually rescued and taken off-planet by Zekk, Luke Skywalker, and Lusa, who had come looking for them.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Bounty\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Bounty]]''</ref>\n\nBack at the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]] on Coruscant,Skywalker requested that an inspection team be sent to Ryloth to investigate reports of Diversity Alliance aggression. After recording an encrypted message to his wife explaining their plan, Bornan and Raynar Thul, Zekk, the Solo twins, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca gathered up explosives and went to the plague warehouse, intent on destroying it. They were almost finished wiring their explosives when Diversity Alliance ships arrived. In the ensuing confrontation with Tarkona in the warehouse, some of the plague canisters were ruptured, including the Human-killing plague. Bornan Thul sacrificed himself so the plague would not spread, and told Raynar to get himself and his friends off the asteroid.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Bounty\" />\n\nMeanwhile in space, a [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|New Republic fleet]] under Han Solo defeated the Diversity Alliance fleet. However, Tarkona managed to escape to a distant asteroid, although she would later die from a Twi'lek-specific disease. Meanwhile on Ryloth, [[Battle of Ryloth (Diversity Alliance Crisis)|fighting]] took place when the New Republic inspection team discovered stockpiles of weapons. However, the fighting was stopped by the Twi'lek [[Kur (Twi'lek)|Kur]], who convinced the Diversity Alliance soldiers that they had been misguided and that both Humans and non-Humans should work together. With the Diversity Alliance defeated, the young Jedi had removed another threat to the New Jedi Order and the New Republic.

The race became an exciting event when, at the last moment, Zekk, along with Tenel Ka and Lowbacca, won the race. After the race, the group encountered [[Czethros]], a bounty hunter who had hunted Han Solo years ago. However, Czethros now claimed to be an \"honest\" businessman, and they avoided any conflict. Unfortunately for them, the surprises were not over. At their hangar bay, the group was ambushed by several [[Chameleon creature]]s. They were rescued by [[Anja Gallandro]], a young woman who wielded a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], but was not a Jedi. Instead, Gallandro relied on doses of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] to enhance her senses and allow her to wield a lightsaber safely.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Return to Ord Mantell\" />\n\nGallandro blamed Han Solo for killing her [[Gallandro/Legends|father]], but Solo denied the charge because the elder Gallandro had died in a trap while searching for treasure. However, unbeknown to the Solos, Anja Gallandro was actually an undercover agent for Czethros, who was in fact a leader of [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]. The infamous galactic crime syndicate had been keeping a low profile for years since the death of its leader [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]] during a [[Battle over Coruscant|battle]] above Coruscant in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]]. However, since then, Black Sun had been attempting to gain power over the New Republic by planting their sympathizers and agents in places of power, including political, economic, and military positions. For his part, Czethros controlled Gallandro by keeping her addicted to spice.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Return to Ord Mantell\" />\n\nHan Solo managed to convince Gallandro that he was good-intentioned by stopping a 25-year-long civil war on her backwater homeworld of [[Anobis]]. There, the elder Solo met with the two rival factions and brokered a truce between them. This made Gallandro wonder whether her hatred for the elder Solo had been misplaced, and she agreed to join the Solo twins and their companions at the Jedi Praxeum to discover her abilities.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Return to Ord Mantell\" />\n\nLater, Lando Calrissian invited the twins and their friends to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], where he wanted them to be the first to try out the new [[SkyCenter Galleria]] amusement park which he had invested in through the use of repurchased interests from the spice mining world of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]], and through shares from a mining operation on [[Varn]]. However, things took a turn for the worse when [[Cojahn]], a business associate of Calrissian's, was found dead. Complicating matters further, the Jedi discovered Czethros's true intentions and his plot for galactic domination. Jacen, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca were also ambushed by several [[Ugnaught/Legends|Ugnaught]] Black Sun mercenaries in the lower levels of Cloud City.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Trouble on Cloud City\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Trouble on Cloud City]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:SoloTwins_EGttF.jpg|thumb|right|Jaina and Jacen at the newly rebuilt Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4.]]\nAfter the Jedi revealed Czethros's plans, Czethros was targeted by the New Republic, and warrants for his arrest were issued on many worlds. However, he managed to evade capture and went underground. Unfortunately for Gallandro, she realized that without Czethros, there would be no supplier for the spice that fueled her addiction. Gallandro then stole Zekk's ship, the ''[[Lightning Rod]]'', and traveled to the ocean world of [[Dac|Mon Calamari]], where she hoped to retrieve a hidden stash of [[Andris/Legends|andris]] spice from beneath the planet's frozen ice cap.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef \">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef]]''</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]], Calrissian's longtime [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] mate [[Nien Nunb/Legends|Nien Nunb]] was nearly killed during a suspicious accident in the carbon-freezing sections of a processing facility. Black Sun had planted cells there, and the Sullustan knew he was in danger. His workers were turning against him and he called for help. Solo and Lowbacca went to Kessel to help protect Nunb, while Jacen, Tenel Ka and Zekk pursued Gallandro to Mon Calamari. On Mon Calamari, at the resort city of [[Crystal Reef]], Jacen confronted Gallandro while she tried to lease a [[submersible]] to hunt for the hidden spice stash. Jacen managed to help Gallandro confront her spice addiction and persuaded her to accept her father's real fate. With Gallandro's help, they succeeded in destroying Czethros's stash of spice on Mon Calamari.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef \" />\n\nBack on Kessel, Czethros and an army of Black Sun mercenaries took control of the planet and captured Nunb, though Solo and Lowbacca managed to escape. The encounter also revealed how deeply Black Sun had infiltrated the New Republic, and that they had contacts on a variety of worlds. From Kessel, Czethros hoped to send a signal that would activate these cells. However, Solo and Lowbacca sabotaged his operations by destroying the transmitter before Czethros could broadcast the signal. Solo also helped free the prisoners and defeated the Black Sun mercenaries. Rather than allow himself to be captured, Czethros threw himself into a vat of [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and was flash-frozen instantly. However, the criminal was retrieved and placed in New Republic custody. [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] Leia Organa Solo would supervise his thawing and interrogation. As a result, the names of Black Sun moles in strategic positions of power were discovered, defeating the crime syndicate.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef \" />\n\nFollowing this ordeal, the Solo twins, Anakin, Tenel Ka, Lowbacca, and Zekk were promoted to apprentice [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] during a ceremony at the Jedi Praxeum.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef \" /> Jaina Solo became the apprentice of her aunt Mara as she continued her training. To congratulate her, Han rewarded Solo with a heavily modified [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]], the [[Crystal (starfighter)|''Crystal'']], which she flew to Mon Calamari for a short vacation at Crystal Reef resort. However, before she could jump from the [[Yavin system/Legends|Yavin system]], Solo was intercepted by the ''[[Bail Jumper]]'', an X-wing piloted by a [[Unidentified cyborg pilot|cyborg pilot]]. The cyborg had mistaken her craft for the ''[[Onyx Star]]'', an early Z-95 prototype that had been stolen from [[Bahalian Shipyards]]. Initially, the cyborg's superhuman reaction speed coupled with a newer starfighter caused Solo to feel outclassed. However, Solo used the Force to become attuned to her new vessel in combat, then made fast work of the pilot and his ship, and continued her course to Mon Calamari.<ref name=\"TC\" />\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong War (25 ABY&ndash;29 ABY)===\n====Early strikes====\n{{Quote|Nineteen.

As they approached the system, fighters from the rival world of [[Osarian]] tried to surround their craft. However, Jade Skywalker ordered Solo to lose their pursuit, which she attempted to do, flying the ''Jade Sabre'' through a series of wild evasive maneuvers. When a Jedi-flown X-wing arrived and fended off the pursuers, the remaining fighters left, allowing Solo to pilot the ''Jade Sabre'' into the hangar of a New Republic battlecruiser, [[Mediator (Mediator-class)|''Mediator'']], that was trying to maintain the peace between rival worlds Rhommamool and Osarian. Their Jedi rescuer turned out to be [[Wurth Skidder]], a Jedi known for his reputation for impulsiveness. Leia Organa Solo immediately chastised him for opening fire, costing her any kind of diplomatic advantage she could have used against the Osarians in negotiations over their attempt to surround and force the ''Jade Sabre'' to land on Osarian. Undeterred, though, the three pressed forward with their planned negotiations to settle the hostilities between Rhommamool and Osarian.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]''</ref>\n\nThe three women met with Anor, who had dressed similar to Darth Vader as an affront to Leia. Anor seemed uninterested in negotiation, launching into a series of lectures on New Republic tyranny and issuing demands for Osarian's disarmament. He then sent them on their way, leaving the three women irritated. As they left, Anor made sure they overflew a scene of mass droid destruction, just to offend C-3PO, who had accompanied the delegation.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" />\n\nSolo flew the others back to Coruscant, as her mother was tired and Jade Skywalker needed to rest. She was not there long, though, as her family and the Skywalkers decided to visit her adopted uncle Lando Calrissian at his latest operation, a mining facility out on [[Dubrillion/Legends|Dubrillion]]. For her part, Solo was allowed to fly her X-wing solo from a layover on [[Reecee/Legends|Reecee]] to Dubrillion as a test of her piloting abilities by Jade Skywalker. As part of her test, Jade Skywalker provided slightly incorrect coordinates to Solo, forcing her to use the Force to locate her family and make a flight correction to meet them. They met with an enthusiastic Calrissian, who gladly showed them around his extensive operation on Dubrillion.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" />\n\nOf particular interest to the three Solo children was an opportunity to fly a modified TIE fighter through a treacherous asteroid belt called [[Lando's Folly]]. Visiting pilots seeking renown used the course as an opportunity to hone their skills and in the modified TIEs, which had shield protection, the flight was fairly safe. Jaina Solo flew last and despite encountering a particularly difficult stretch of asteroids, used the Force to guide her hands. With piloting that impressed her viewers, she achieved a new record time, beating out the previous winner, Jedi Knight [[Kyp Durron]]. The three Solo children met with Durron later, who congratulated Solo on her victory and then departed with his [[Kyp's Dozen|squadron]] to battle smugglers and pirates in the Outer Rim. They then watched Han Solo and Chewbacca tackle the asteroid field in a two-seat craft. Despite a serious equipment malfunction that deprived them of shields, they were able to make it through also and Solo congratulated her father on his accomplishment.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" />\n\nFollowing that, Calrissian asked Han Solo to make a supply run to the nearby world of [[Sernpidal/Legends|Sernpidal]], which the elder Solo agreed to do, accompanied by his son Anakin. They found that the planet was doomed, that its moon [[Dobido]] was on a terminal orbit to impact on the planet. While trying to evacuate as many people as possible, Chewbacca was left behind trying to save Anakin and perished. The loss tore through the Solo family, particularly Han. Upon the return of her father and Anakin, Solo tried to comfort her brother, but both he and Han were inconsolable. The Solos and Skywalkers also soon learned of an [[Yuuzhan Vong|alien menace]] that had all but destroyed Durron's squadron, was [[Yuuzhan Vong War|invading the galaxy]], and had instigated the [[destruction of Sernpidal]]. After reports were received regarding a group of ships belonging to the aliens&mdash;the Yuuzhan Vong&mdash;approaching Dubrillion, Solo and her brothers joined the [[Battle of Dubrillion|defense]] of the planet. They engaged Yuuzhan Vong [[Yorik-et|coralskipper]] starfighters defending the settlements on Dubrillion, fighting from Calrissian's modified TIEs. After picking up pursuit, they headed into Lando's Folly and used a [[Force meld]] to coordinate their flying. In the ensuing chase, all the hostile craft were destroyed by their synchronized gunnery and the hazardous asteroids, though Anakin made a risky jump to hyperspace in order to escape. However, he returned safely and they were hailed as heroes by the populace of Dubrillion.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" />\n\nHowever, after Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker found evidence of a massive Yuuzhan Vong base on [[Helska IV]], with prisoners trapped inside, the Solo twins slipped away and took one of Lando's [[iceborer]]s to puncture the ice planet and rescue them. After Solo loaded Jacen, clad in a Yuuzhan Vong skirt and equipped with an [[Cloaker#Masquers|ooglith masquer]] for disguise, into the iceborer, she flew the iceborer ''[[Merry Miner]]'' to Helska IV, but was quickly detected by coralskippers. Fortunately for them, a New Republic task force arrived, accompanied by the ''Millennium Falcon'' and ''Jade Sabre.'' While the fleet engaged the Yuuzhan Vong, Solo waited in orbit in the unarmed mining ship, dodging coralskippers, until Jacen was ready for extraction, having rescued the captured [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] [[Danni Quee]] and witnessed the death of the other prisoner, Jedi [[Miko Reglia]]. After the New Republic was [[Battle of Helska IV|repulsed]] the from Helska IV with the loss of the Star Destroyer ''[[Rejuvenator]]'', the Solos, Skywalkers, and Calrissian realized how serious the Yuuzhan Vong threat was, particularly after Quee told them of the [[yammosk]] war coordinator buried beneath the planet that telepathically coordinated the Yuuzhan Vong warships.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" />\n\nThey decided to evaporate the ice planet using Calrissian's [[shieldship]]s, and Solo flew in the ''Jade Sabre'' as part of the covering fleet of starfighters and other ships protecting the shieldships against the Yuuzhan Vong defense. When Mara Jade Skywalker collapsed in the heat of battle, Solo attempted to take over as pilot, but soon needed help herself as she tried to alter the ship's present course. The ship would have crashed into the planet had Luke Skywalker not intervened and used his X-wing's repulsor coils to alter the ''Jade Sabre''{{'s}} course. Solo regained control and was able to escape the planet, which was successfully frozen before it exploded in a cloud of ice crystals.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" />\n\n====Missions with Galfridian====\n{{Quote|Trust me, Finn. It might hurt you to hear this&hellip;but Jaina ''is'' the best pilot here.|Jacen Solo to Finn Galfridian|Invasion: Rescues 2}}\n[[File:Jaina-Invasion2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jaina on Yavin 4.]]\nWhen the Yuuzhan Vong captured the planet of [[Artorias]], Luke Skywalker helped the New Republic to evacuate some people of the planet and then traveled with Prince [[Finn Galfridian]] to the Academy on Yavin IV. Galfridian started his Jedi training at the Academy and met Solo along with her two brothers and Lowbacca. Solo and Galfridian trained with their lightsabers together and the young prince displayed some interest in her, while she talked with him about the war, empathizing over his loss of his family and planet. However the Solo twins, Galfridian and Lowbacca got into trouble shortly afterward when they encountered a [[Tuk'ata/Legends|tuk'ata]], which wanted to attack them. Because of the development of their Jedi training, the Solos and Lowbacca reacted without fear while Galfridian was frozen with terror. Jacen was able to send the creature away and a short time later, a disappointed Galfridian left Yavin IV and traveled with Solo's uncle to [[Rychel]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Invasion 2: Refugees, Part 2\">[[Invasion 2|''Invasion'' 2]]</ref>\n\nLater, Solo traveled with her mother, her brothers, Lowbacca, and Galfridian to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', which Han Solo had allowed his wife and family to use. They were searching for a smuggler with information on covert Yuuzhan Vong agents but initially met little success. However, Galfridian met Han Solo aboard the ''Falcon'' unexpectedly while searching for his droid companion, [[Prowl]]. On this occasion, a petulant Solo frightened Galfridian by warning him to get not too close with his daughter, or else face being shot.<ref name=\"Star Wars Invasion 4: Refugees, Part 4\">[[Invasion 4|''Invasion'' 4]]</ref> While Jacen and Lowbacca went to the criminal [[Dahal]], who had stolen Jacen's credit pouch, Solo and the others watched the meeting with the help of Prowl. Hoping that Dahal would lead them to their smuggler, Galfridian followed Dahal with Prowl but refused the help of Solo and the others. Eventually, they were able to confront the [[Vratix/Legends|Vratix]] smuggler [[Spraug]] via Galfridian's surveillance. From Spraug, they retrieved a Jedi holocron detailing the identity of a Yuuzhan Vong agent&mdash;[[Dulac]], an advisor to Galfridian's father&mdash;from him after Solo and her companions prevented him from fleeing.<ref name=\"Star Wars Invasion 5: Refugees, Part 5\">[[Invasion 5|''Invasion'' 5]]</ref>\n\nSolo and her brother, Galfridian, and Luke Skywalker were together on Yavin IV, examining the holocron recovered on Nar Shaddaa, when Galfridian announced that he was leaving to locate his missing father. After Galfridian said he was going to fly to Artorias with only Prowl as an escort, Solo chastised him for his lack of planning, suggesting that he would be better off finishing his training. However, when she and Jacen found the Artorian prince and Prowl looking for a ship to abscond with in the middle of the night, they volunteered to accompany them instead of stopping them, despite the absence of a firm plan. They obtained Master Skywalker's reluctant permission to journey to Artorias and blasted off.<ref name=\"Star Wars Invasion 6: Rescues, Part 1\">[[Invasion: Rescues 1|''Invasion: Rescues'' 1]]</ref>\n\nActing as pilot for their ship, Solo brought them out of hyperspace prematurely so they could assess the Yuuzhan Vong defenses. While discussing how to reach the surface of Artorias, Galfridian suggested crash-landing the ship and making their way to an underwater refuge his people had prepared in case of emergencies. Solo agreed with that course of action and flew closer to Artorias, only to find that there was scarcely any Yuuzhan Vong presence in orbit. The Yuuzhan Vong launched [[grutchin]] insects at their vessel, which started chewing through the hull. In response, Solo noted that if the hull was breached before they cleared Artorias's atmosphere, they were dead. Galfridian went out into space and destroyed the grutchins already on the ship with his and Solo's lightsabers while Jacen manned the turret to destroy other incoming insects. Solo managed to bring their damaged ship into atmosphere to crash-land in the water, which allowed Galfridian to steer the ship to his people's refuge. There, they disembarked and Galfridian learned that his father was still alive, but in the company of Dulac.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Invasion: Rescues 2\">[[Invasion: Rescues 2|''Invasion: Rescues'' 2]]</ref>\n\nRushing to the chamber where Dulac and the elder Galfridian were locked in combat, the Solos helped slay Dulac. However, before falling to their lightsabers, Dulac used an ocular implant to spit poison at the Artorian king.<ref name=\"Star Wars Invasion 8: Rescues, Part 3\">[[Invasion: Rescues 3|''Invasion: Rescues'' 3]]</ref> Solo and her brother used their Jedi healing techniques to forestall the king's death and alleviate his pain, but they could not completely counter the effects of the Yuuzhan Vong poison. Before the elder Galfridian expired, Solo advised Finn Galfridian to say his goodbyes to his father.<ref name=\"Star Wars Invasion 9: Rescues, Part 4\">[[Invasion: Rescues 4|''Invasion: Rescues'' 4]]</ref>\n\nThe Solo twins attended the funeral for the elder Galfridian, where Finn Galfridian vowed that the Artorian refugees would one day return and reclaim the planet from the Yuuzhan Vong. Though most of the refugees were headed elsewhere, Galfridian had been told by his holocron to journey to Nar Shaddaa. The Solos decided to return to the Jedi Praxeum instead, though Jacen told Galfridian that he and Solo were only a call away. They parted ways on Nar Shaddaa, despite Solo's suggestion that Galfridian return to Yavin IV. She also warned him not to get killed, saying that it would be difficult to explain leaving him on Nar Shaddaa if he perished. Solo left Galfridian with a kiss on the cheek, which drew the attention of her twin, though she dismissed it as a purely platonic gesture.<ref name=\"Star Wars Invasion II: Rescues, Part 6\">[[Invasion: Rescues 6|''Invasion: Rescues'' 6]]</ref>\n\n====Rogue Squadron====\n{{Quote|With my parents I could be a smuggler who saved the galaxy or a diplomat who saved the galaxy.|Jaina Solo|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught}}\nUpon Solo's eventual return to the Jedi Praxeum, she met with her brothers and uncle, who had called a meeting of the Jedi and handed out assignments to each of them. Solo's assignment was to go pick up Danni Quee and journeyed with her mother to [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] to address their rulers, persuading them to aid the effort against the Yuuzhan Vong. Their words moved the Agamarian leaders, who agreed to harbor refugees. Solo was bored with her assignment, as she had little to do but teach Quee some Force techniques and support her mother. She was also unsure of her identity and somewhat resented being around Leia Solo, whom she felt overshadowed her. Solo discussed her feelings with Quee, who told her that it was normal to pursue her own identity, but also advised her to not reject the admirable qualities that Solo's mother possessed. However, the issue of identity would plague Solo throughout the war and beyond.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nThe three women then returned to Dubrillion to evacuate much of the populace, accompanied by Admiral [[Traest Kre'fey]] and a small New Republic flotilla. After their arrival on Dubrillion, Solo was inducted into the famous X-wing unit [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] due to the persistence of her mother and her own skills in flying an X-wing, though Solo was unaware of Leia's involvement in her Rogue Squadron acceptance. Solo was given the designation Rogue Eleven and soon earned the nickname \"Sticks\" due to her lightsaber's shape and her X-Wing had a joystick. She also befriended her wingman, a female Human named [[Anni Capstan]]. Solo's first action was to fly cover for the transports evacuating civilians as the Yuuzhan Vong attacked the convoy. Most of the ships were able to escape and Solo helped defeat a Yuuzhan Vong warship by firing proton torpedoes at its weapons right after they fired and before the triskele valve that protected them could reseal.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nThe convoy's exit vector to Agamar blocked by the Yuuzhan Vong, Solo, Leia, and Danni then brought the refugees to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], where they helped set up a camp there with the aid of Kre'fey's ship, ''[[Ralroost]]''. However, the Yuuzhan Vong were not far behind and soon launched a large air and ground assault on the refugee camp. In pre-battle planning, Solo innovated a tactic that detonated proton torpedoes prematurely before they could be consumed by a [[dovin basal]] shielding creature to cause collateral damage and overload the dovin basal. Her commanding officer, Colonel [[Gavin Darklighter]], approved of the tactic. During the [[Battle of Dantooine (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Dantooine]], Solo helped refugees escape offworld before the Vong could take Dantooine. She and the other Rogue Squadron pilots fought with coralskippers that were harassing the camp and also participated in strafing runs on Yuuzhan Vong ground forces. To help counter two Yuuzhan Vong ''[[rakamat]]'' walkers, Solo and three other Rogue pilots were tasked with firing torpedoes at it while Luke Skywalker turned the defensive dovin basals on the ''rakamat'', consuming it. The defeat of the walkers allowed the remaining refugees&mdash;half had fallen to the relentless Yuuzhan Vong&mdash;to board the remaining ships and flee to Agamar, their retreat covered by the Rogues and Kre'fey. Solo and her brothers then returned to Coruscant along with Kre'fey.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nRogue Squadron kept her busy though, and soon the young Rogue Eleven was helping recruit new pilots and training under noted pilots [[Tycho Celchu]] and Wedge Antilles. At the same time, she and her brothers had to deal with her father's descent into depression and drunkenness, as a result of losing Chewbacca. When she wasn't training, Solo flew on missions such as covering the [[Battle of Garqi]]. That event inserted her brother Jacen and a commando/Jedi team onto the ground on Garqi to perform a reconnaissance of the planet. Solo encouraged her brother to not only prepare, but to also take the time to focus on the mission and learn from his companions, Jedi [[Corran Horn]] and [[Ganner Rhysode]]. During that run, Solo was deceived, along with almost everyone else in the New Republic task force led by Traest Kre'fey, into thinking Jacen and the ground team had been killed during insertion. She was understandably upset at first, thinking her brother dead. After being informed of the truth later by Darklighter, she was pleased to find out that was not the case, but did not enjoy the deception, even though it was necessary for operational security. The event humbled her, as Solo realized she didn't have any right to special information regarding the mission and it reminded her that she was accorded any undue privileges due to her heritage.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref>\n\nTheir next mission was a reconnaissance run through the ruins of Sernpidal, another difficult emotional experience for Solo due to the death of Chewbacca in the planet's destruction. They found the Yuuzhan Vong were growing a [[Koros-Strohna|worldship]] and immediately reported back to their [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], ''Ralroost'', to relay what they had found. Solo and ''Ralroost'' returned to Garqi and once again flew cover for the commando team, though this time she was covering the extraction from the planet. The presence of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet nearly doomed them, but the timely arrival of Admiral Pellaeon's Imperial fleet, accompanied by [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] pilots, turned the tide. The Chiss pilots were led by [[Jagged Fel]], son of famed Imperial ace Baron [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]] and nephew of New Republic ace Wedge Antilles. He and a group of his pilots patronizingly escorted Solo and her wingman Capstan back to ''Ralroost'', much to her irritation. The ground team's discovery on Garqi that [[Bafforr tree|bafforr]] pollen had an adverse effect on Yuuzhan Vong [[Vonduun Skerr Kyrric|vonduun crab armor]] led Kre'fey to retreat his forces to [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]], where the bafforr trees grew. The Yuuzhan Vong had also learned of this discovery, though, and planned a full-scale assault.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" />\n\n[[File:Solokids.jpg|thumb|left|Jaina as a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] pilot in [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]].]]\nAs the defense for Ithor was planned, Solo was invited to attend a formal ceremony on Ithor attended by Imperial, Chiss, and New Republic military representatives, as well as few New Republic and Imperial politicians also. Solo in particular wanted to meet the leader of the Chiss unit, who had defeated her several times in simulations. To her surprise, she found that their leader was a Human, Jagged Fel, who took the time to introduce himself to her and backhandedly complimented her on her flying skill.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" />\n\nWhen a shuttle arrived from the Yuuzhan Vong bearing the remains of the [[Caamasi]] Senator [[Elegos A'Kla]], Solo and Capstan were sent out to retrieve it. While watching the decontamination procedures, she was joined by Fel, who commented that they should just take the risk and open the shuttle. Solo responded that his comments seemed very mature, at which Fel implied she wasn't sufficiently hardened or mature enough to handle battle. Solo took offense at his remarks, but at the same time felt something stir within her for the stolid pilot. At any rate, the remains of A'Kla also came with a challenge from the Yuuzhan Vong commander [[Shedao Shai]], threatening Ithor and in particular, Corran Horn, who had offended Shai on Bimmiel.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" />\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong [[Battle of Ithor|attacked Ithor]] soon enough and in force. Solo and the rest of the Rogues launched to engage their fighters and troop transports. During the battle, while engaging the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, she lost her wingmate Anni Capstan, which emotionally hurt Solo deeply. The New Republic forces were nevertheless able to stall the space advance. However, the battle overall was a loss for the New Republic since the Yuuzhan Vong unleashed a biological weapon that decimated Ithor's world-spanning jungle even after [[Shedao Shai]] was slain during a duel with Jedi Knight Corran Horn that had been set to determine Ithor's fate. The attack violated the terms of the duel, but devastated Ithor's surface, causing the Imperial forces to return to the Remnant and Horn to be exiled, though two of the Chiss squadrons and Fel remained in the New Republic. Furthermore, Ithor's destruction contributed much to the [[Anti-Jedi sentiment/Legends|Anti-Jedi sentiment]] of the galactic public. For her part, Solo bore her own grief for the loss of her wingmate, though Anakin tried to help her through it.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" />\n\nJaina Solo accompanied her family to Chewbacca's funeral on Kashyyyk, where she stood by her grieved father, trying to support him emotionally. In his grief at the loss of his longtime friend, Han lashed out and left his family behind on Kashyyyk, ordering Solo to take the family back to Coruscant in the ''Millennium Falcon''. This eventually lead to a stronger bond between Solo and her mother, who she previously lambasted for her distance.<ref name=\"AoC:HT\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref> In her father's absence, Solo continued her career as a Rogue, though she did take a brief leave to visit Yavin IV, where she learned of a plan posited by Talon Karrde to meet with the Hutts for intelligence-gathering purposes. Solo offered to aid Talon Karrde on his mission, but Ganner Rhysode and Kyp Durron volunteered and were chosen instead.<ref name=\"AoCII:JE\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''</ref>\n\n====Wounded in combat====\n{{Quote|We saw what Yuuzhan Vong promises meant on Duro.

The battle went poorly for the New Republic because the extragalactic aliens had employed their [[Yo'gand's Core]] tactic; this involved using a dovin basal to cause Kalarba and its moon [[Hosk Station/Legends|Hosk Station]] to collide. The New Republic fleet, outnumbered and outgunned, was forced to simply defend fleeing refugee ships while dueling coralskippers.<ref name=\"Balance Point\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref>\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong then assaulted the flagship of the New Republic fleet, the [[Bothan Assault Cruiser]] [[Champion (vehicle)|''Champion'']]. Solo attempted to defend the ship, but the Yuuzhan Vong succeeded in destroying it. The explosion wrecked her X-wing, though she managed to eject into space. Before she was retrieved she experienced [[hallucination]]s caused by low oxygen levels, where she spent several hours talking to [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], but couldn't understand what he was saying because he was speaking [[Gamorrese|Gamorrean]] the whole time.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" /> Unfortunately for her, Solo also suffered injuries that temporarily blinded her. She received a medical leave transfer to [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], which had been selected as a [[Senate Select Committee for Refugees|SELCORE]] haven for refugees from conquered worlds and was where her father and brother Jacen were.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\n[[File:Jainainbactatank.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Solo heals in a bacta tank after going extravehicular.]]\nSolo was not thrilled to be taken off active duty, but she tried to rest and heal as quickly as possible, knowing that the Yuuzhan Vong were continuing to advance, taking [[Druckenwell/Legends|Druckenwell]] and [[Rodia/Legends|Rodia]]. She tried to get a message to her mother via Senator [[Viqi Shesh]], but was unsuccessful, which frustrated her. One night, Jacen awakened her, bringing her to investigate a strange insect infestation. They soon realized that the insects were [[naotebe wingling]]s, a Yuuzhan Vong creation meant to destroy the refugee camps on Duro. They evacuated their colony, but the decontamination procedures to avoid spreading the winglings required Solo to go through the same quarantine as all the other evacuees, which required her to be dipped in a chemical bath and her head shaved to prevent the winglings from spreading. While there, she, Han and Jacen were joined by Leia Solo, who had also been on Duro working with the refugees. However, Solo was not pleased to see her mother, blaming her for being absent in the midst of her daughter's darkest hours. Leia replied that she hadn't even known about Solo's injuries and further stated that she would undergo the same decontamination procedures as Solo and the rest of the refugees&mdash;which included having her head shaved. That brought some measure of respect from Solo towards her mother, though Solo continued to resent her mother's perceived lack of attention to her children.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\nWhile she convalesced and her sight continued to return, she was asked by her father to deal with a troublesome Hutt, [[Randa Besadii Diori]]. She approached him to upbraid him for crashing into the communications shed when he suddenly handed her a Yuuzhan Vong [[villip]] communication device, telling her that the Yuuzhan Vong had an agent in the camp and that he had already reported the matter to Senator Shesh, one of the senatorial leaders of SELCORE.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\nShe was then asked by Mara Jade Skywalker to help her investigate a [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] scientist named [[Nom Anor|Dassid Cree'Ar]], who was ostensibly working on reclaiming Duro's toxic environment. Solo agreed and they proceeded&mdash;with Skywalker disguised as [[Baron/Legends|Baroness]] Muehling of Kuat and Solo as Emlee, her servant. They discovered that Cree'Ar was actually the Yuuzhan Vong [[Nom Anor]]. Solo used the Force to unmask him, but he fled before they could subdue him. Anor attempted to cave in a tunnel on them, but Jade Skyawalker was able to keep the rock fall from crushing them until help arrived.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\nKnowledge of Anor's presence came too late, since he had already sabotaged several of the operations, including releasing the naotebe winglings that had destroyed a refugee encampment. As the refugees were again frantically prepared for evacuation, Solo helped Mara, Anakin and Luke Skywalker find her brother Jacen, who had gone missing. While Anakin and Skywalker staged a diversion, Solo found the building where her brother was unknowingly waiting for a meeting with a collaborationist who intended on turning him over to the Yuuzhan Vong. She helped him escape but they still had no way of tracking down the Yuuzhan Vong agents or collaborationist [[Peace Brigade]] members on Duro. The planet was then [[Battle of Duro (Yuuzhan Vong War)|attacked]] by the Yuuzhan Vong, who sabotaged the planetary shields and unleashed bioengineered siege creatures including [[Tu-Scart]] and [[Sgauru]] and the serpentine [[Ychna]]. Despite the efforts of the Jedi and the New Republic, Duro fell and became the first [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] to be conquered.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\nWhen it fell, Solo was on the ground with her mother and other refugees, seeking shelter underground. While the rest of the refugees tried to dig their way farther from the Yuuzhan Vong landing party, Leia Solo sought to sabotage the Yuuzhan Vong advance, bringing her daughter and son Jacen with her. They managed to free some prisoners by taking out their guards, but Leia was not through. She attempted to use a mining laser to inflict further damage, only to be caught by a Yuuzhan Vong party. She closed a door, sealing her children off from her, though she urged them to run before she did so. Her choice meant that the twins could escape, but their mother was captured. Jacen immediately went back for her, and while Solo hesitated some, expressing more resentment towards her mother abandoning them again, she too eventually returned also. Solo soon found her mother imprisoned by the Yuuzhan Vong and was able to communicate with her in [[Mon Calamari blink code]] by tapping on the walls. Solo wanted to free her mother immediately, but Leia instead told her to warn the others of her captor&mdash;Warmaster [[Tsavong Lah]]&mdash;and his threat to destroy Duro's orbital cities and the millions of people in them. Solo obeyed the request and relayed the message, though she was exasperated at her mother running her off yet again. She then returned just in time to see Jacen finishing off the Yuuzhan Vong that had been [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] her mother. With Jacen carrying a wounded Leia, Solo led the way out back through the tunnels on Duro back to the ''Millennium Falcon'' where Han Solo was waiting for them. They then blasted off Duro together. The incident on Duro led Tsavong Lah to offer the galaxy a chance at peace in exchange for the Jedi, particularly Jacen.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\n[[File:Destinysjaina.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Jaina Solo during the Yuuzhan Vong War]]\nSolo returned to Coruscant with her brothers while Han Solo arranged for Leia's medical treatment. After her mother returned, Solo was asked to accompany her to a Senate meeting charging Senator Viqi Shesh with corruption. Though Leia's legs were still injured, she asked her daughter to use the Force to help her walk and Solo complied. The charges laid out by Leia against Shesh were serious and led to the Appeasement Vote, a law that might have outlawed the Jedi, failing by a two-to-one margin while Shesh dealt with the corruption charges.<ref name=\"Recovery\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing that meeting, Solo, attending a gathering of Jedi on Coruscant where Kyp Durron angrily expressed his irritation with what he perceived as inaction by Luke Skywalker and many of the other Jedi. Solo and her siblings came to the defense of their uncle, though they agreed with Durron on the need to take action against the invaders. Following Durron storming out, Solo and her brother Anakin caught up with him and attempted to persuade him to stay, but he stubbornly refused. Solo and her brothers then tried to determine where the Yuuzhan Vong and their Peace Brigade allies would strike next and concluded that the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 was a likely target. They told their uncle about the situation, and though he acknowledged the threat, he said he needed them for other missions. Anakin did not heed those instructions, though, and went to Yavin 4 himself, arriving shortly before the Peace Brigade attacked.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]''</ref>\n\nWord of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet appearing over the system prompted Skywalker and Solo to speak to New Republic Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya to seek military aid in the Yavin system, but Fey'lya turned them down. Solo proposed mustering as many Jedi and ships as they could manage without official help or authority, but Skywalker urged patience. While they were trying to decide what to do, Solo and Jacen realized that Mara was pregnant, and congratulated her. Mara thanked them and offered them the use of the ''Jade Shadow'' to find [[Booster Terrik]] and his Star Destroyer ''[[Errant Venture]]'' to obtain his help at rescuing the students from Yavin Four. They accepted the assignment and went on their way. Eventually they were able to locate Terrik and helped him recover Anakin and his friend [[Tahiri Veila]] from occupied Yavin. The three young Solos defended the evacuation of the last few students by Talon Karrde's ships, at one point confronting dozens of Yuuzhan Vong on foot with their lightsabers.<ref name=\"TEGW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref> Taking off in their X-wings, the Solo twins were able to keep Yuuzhan Vong ships from attacking the salvaged transport Anakin had obtained to transport the Jedi students who hadn't been retrieved by Talon Karrde long enough for Terrik to recover them all and retreat.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nSolo returned to Coruscant, expecting to be recalled back into Rogue Squadron once her eyes had fully healed, but they were reluctant to do so because of anti-Jedi political pressures. When a warrant was placed for the arrest of Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, the two elder Jedi fled in the ''Jade Shadow'', signaling Solo to fly cover for them. She helped them fend off a formation of interceptors, crippling their ships rather than destroying them. Rogue Squadron came to assist the Skywalkers as a show of support, though Master Skywalker told them not to endanger themselves and their future with the New Republic. Colonel Darklighter told Solo that she was still a Rogue, which she appreciated, even if she couldn't fly with them at the moment. At that point, the Skywalkers prepared to jump to hyperspace. Before they did so, though, Luke asked Solo to locate Kyp Durron and arrange a meeting with him. He also provided her the means to locate Durron&mdash;a tracking device aboard his ship that placed his location near Sernpidal.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''</ref>\n\nSolo reached the remote system where Durron was, and he expressed gratitude at seeing her, saying that he was just about to come looking for her and Rogue Squadron. Solo gratefully put down at his remote base to discuss what he had found, and also explained to Durron that Master Skywalker wished to meet with him. Durron replied that would see the Jedi Master, but wanted Solo's help with something in exchange. He informed her of a massive Yuuzhan Vong vessel being grown in the ruins of Sernpidal, which he described as a planet-destroying weapon. Convinced of the threat, Solo reported the existence of a Yuuzhan Vong [[gravitic superweapon]] to her superiors, though she didn't trust Durron, nor did she appreciate his aggressive and manipulative manner. Landing on Chandrila with Durron, she met with Darklighter and Antilles to explain the threat. Antilles was not pleased to see Durron, but after examining the report for himself, he agreed that action was needed and contacted Admiral Kre'fey.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth\" />\n\nWhile they waited for his response, Solo found herself alone with Durron. He asked her to fly with his squadron in pending attack on Sernpidal, which she refused in favor of staying with Rogue Squadron. He then asked her to be his apprentice, which she said pessimistically that she would consider, though she was having difficulty in sorting out Durron's true motives and emotions towards her. At any rate, Kre'fey agreed to assist in the attack with his forces and Solo was pleased that she was included in the planning meetings.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth\" />\n\nIn the [[Second Battle of Sernpidal]], Solo, Rogue Squadron, and Kyp's Dozen-and-Two Avengers helped clear the stable hyperspace entry point of Yuuzhan Vong ships so Kre'fey's capital ships could arrive. She destroyed several coralskippers as part of the advance force, but the squadron took heavy casualties even as the capital ships arrived. To augment their numbers, General Antilles took to an X-wing himself, flying alongside Solo, which thrilled her. His piloting instincts alerted to him a trap by coralskippers attempting to ram them and they evaded the suicidal coralskippers successfully. The rest of the squadron was not as fortunate, losing another pilot. Solo continued fighting, but when Kre'fey's ships finished off the superweapon, she was too close to it; the explosion crippled her ship. While drifting through space, she discovered the so-called gravitic superweapon was actually a series of dovin basals that were bringing material for the ship from the system's star. Solo realized that they had been tricked into destroying a [[Koros-Strohna|worldship]] for Yuuzhan Vong civilians, not a weapon. This deception and betrayal caused a deep rift between her and Kyp Durron, as she told him she would never trust him again.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth\" /> The destruction of the worldship also brought the pretense of the Yuuzhan Vong truce to an end.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" >''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref>\n\n====Mission to Myrkr====\n{{Quote|We're here to destroy the queen, not take revenge.''\"<br />\"''Right. Revenge comes later.|Anakin and Jaina Solo referring to the voxyn queen|The New Jedi Order: Star by Star}}\nIn [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]], shortly after the birth of [[Ben Skywalker]], Solo was asked to fly the ''Jade Shadow'', assisting Mara Jade Skywalker on a mission to locate [[Alema Rar|Alema]] and [[Numa Rar]], two Twi'lek Jedi who had been leading an independent resistance on [[New Plympto/Legends|New Plympto]]. The Rar sisters were on the freighter ''[[Nebula Chaser]]'', which Solo located just as it was boarded by a Yuuzhan Vong frigate analog. An [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] jettisoned from the ship and while Solo and Jade Skywalker could do nothing for the hapless refugees and crew aboard the ship, they were able to recover the ship, which contained Alema Rar and the body of Numa. Rar told them of a new Yuuzhan Vong creature, the [[voxyn]], which hunted [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] beings. Several Jedi fell to them, including Solo's brother's old [[Melodie]] classmate [[Lyric]], and the Jedi Master [[Eelysa]]. Furthermore, the Yuuzhan Vong threatened to slay thousands of refugees unless the location of the [[Eclipse Station|new Jedi base]] that Luke Skywalker was creating was revealed. With this dual threat to the Jedi looming over them, Solo and Jade Skywalker returned to Coruscant to determine how to counter this new menace. While there, Solo was still not flying with Rogue Squadron, so she contented herself with watching over baby Ben.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina_21.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Jaina fighting voxyn]]\nWhile the Mon Calamari Jedi Master Cilghal led the investigation into the nature of the voxyn threat from the hidden Jedi shelter on Eclipse, Solo and her brothers agreed to help Cilghal collect more voxyn corpses for study. Solo was placed in charge of tactical planning for the mission based on her experience in Rogue Squadron, though her brother Anakin was in command. Taking a team of young Jedi who had grown up and trained together, they conducted a stake-out on the outskirts of the [[Froz system]], hoping to detect a Yuuzhan Vong ship and voxyn. They watched a Yuuzhan Vong ship approach a freighter, but refrained from engaging it, as it was outside their mission parameters. Durron's squadron, which had also been lying in wait on a separate mission had no compunction about flying in to assist the freighter, only to be caught by a group of Yuuzhan Vong ships jumping into the system. Anakin then led his team of Jedi in their X-wings and blastboat to engage the Yuuzhan Vong ships and rescue Durron. Solo accounted for at least four coralskippers in the brief engagement and they also inflicted heavy damage to a Yuuzhan Vong frigate analog. That engagement was also an opportunity to demonstrate two new tactics: [[shield trio]]s and [[Jedi shadow bomb|shadow bombs]], both of which would become standard Jedi weapons soon enough.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nUpon their return, a large group of the Jedi and their supporters gathered to discuss the voxyn on Eclipse. Cilghal was able to learn that the voxyn were cloned from a single specimen and the [[Voxyn queen|queen]] was on [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]]. In response, Anakin Solo proposed a Jedi strike team be given to the Yuuzhan Vong by a traitor and then seize the Yuuzhan Vong ship once they were deep enough in Yuuzhan Vong space to get to Myrkr. Solo volunteered for the [[Mission to Myrkr|mission]] as well, along with fifteen other young Jedi including her other brother Jacen, Tenel Ka, Tahiri Veila, Alema Rar, and Raynar Thul.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nThe plan developed rapidly as it was agreed that Lando Calrissian would act as the ersatz \"traitor\" handing over the Jedi to the Yuuzhan Vong. Calrissian also provided two of his new [[YVH 1|Yuuzhan Vong Hunter]] droids for the mission, and the droids helped with the strenuous tactical planning for the Jedi strike team. To aid their plan, the Jedi also came up with a plan to use a [[Force meld|Jedi battle meld]] to strengthen each other during the mission, particularly while they were held by the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nCalrissian followed through with his part of the plan, taking the ''Lady Luck'' to a rendezvous point where they were intercepted by a Yuuzhan Vong ship. Calrissian met with their leader, [[Duman Yaght]], and agreed to turn over the seventeen Jedi. Calrissian's wife and crew entered with blasters and \"captured\" the Jedi, forcing them to dispose of their lightsabers down a waste chute. When they were handed over to Yaght, Anakin made a show of attempting to spring a weapons locker and stage a revolt to further the illusion that they were unwilling captives. The blasters inside the locker were stored without their power packs, though, and the Yuuzhan Vong quickly put down the escape attempt. Unfortunately for the strike team, the [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] Jedi [[Ulaha Kore]] was stabbed by a [[coufee]] knife in the struggle and sustained a severe, albeit not fatal, injury.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nNor was Yaght far from done with his Jedi captives. Keeping them bound, cold, barely clothed in the hold, he tortured them one by one, in particular the injured Kore, by exposing them to a voxyn repeatedly and allowing it to use its acid, sonic screech, and claws on them. When Yaght threatened to use a neuropoison on Kore if she didn't confirm the existence of a Jedi base, Solo screamed that it did exist despite the disapproval of the other Jedi. Yaght then released Kore from the torture, only to give Solo a sadistic option; which of her brothers would be tortured next. Based on what her brothers told her mentally, she chose Anakin, as Yaght threatened to harm Kore further if she did not choose. She was then forced to watch as he used a voxyn to gash Anakin repeatedly, until Solo gave away another tidbit of information.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nNow that Yaght knew he could break one member of the team, he continued to press for information, dragging the hapless and weakened Ulaha Kore back for more torture. At that point, Ulaha proceeded to grab a warrior's coufee and kill the voxyn, but was even more severely injured in the process. His instrument of torture destroyed, Yaght ceased his predations temporarily.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nAfter they were deep into Yuuzhan Vong space, Anakin triggered the escape plan. Two YVH droids that had been riding the ship's hull broke free and burst into the ship, freeing the Jedi. They also provided them with arms, [[combat jumpsuit]]s and their lightsabers from an equipment pod that they had also clamped to the ship. Solo helped subdue the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong and their other voxyn and the Jedi used [[Force healing/Legends|healing trances]] to recover from the torture.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nFor her part, when not healing, Solo helped examine the workings of the Yuuzhan Vong ship they had seized and repair the damage inflicted on the YVH droids. They soon reached Myrkr and found a Yuuzhan Vong worldship ''[[Baanu Rass]]'' which orbited [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]] while serving as the voxyn-cloning facility. Solo helped fly the ship even as Anakin used a [[Baradium/Legends|baradium]] missile to destroy a Yuuzhan Vong ''[[matalok]]'' cruiser that attempted to stop them. Kore then volunteered to fly the ship while the strike team disembarked and sought out the voxyn queen. The rest of the team dropped down to the worldship in cargo pods while Kore and one of the Yuuzhan Vong Hunter droids rammed into a group of corvettes that were attempting to capture the ship the Jedi had commandeered.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\n[[File:Myrkr_NEC.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jaina and her brothers on Myrkr]]\nThey advanced through the worldship as discreetly as possible, engaging the Yuuzhan Vong only when necessary. Having sensed other Jedi aboard, they attempted to rescue them, but once the Jedi were freed, the strike team realized they had saved two Dark Jedi, [[Lomi Plo]] and [[Welk]], who agreed to assist them. The strike team was unhappy with the situation, but they could not just leave the two there. They brought the Dark Jedi with them even as the Yuuzhan Vong closed in. Their remaining YVH droid sacrificed itself to destroy a pair of coralskippers and the Yuuzhan Vong added more voxyn to their hunting parties in response. Solo and the strike team set an ambush that slew dozens of the pursuing warriors and their voxyn, but the pursuit remained relentless.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nAs they progressed through an area of a vast voxyn training facility, they found an obsolete [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|All Terrain Armored Transport]] and even a starship, as part of the Yuuzhan Vong simulacrum of environments where the voxyn were expected to hunt Jedi. Anakin started to grow confident as they continued to survive and approach the central voxyn cloning facility, but a series of Yuuzhan Vong traps, including hostile stinging [[flitnat]]s that injured two more Jedi on the team, Lowbacca and [[Jovan Drark]], he began to lose some of his confidence.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nThe strike team pressed on, knowing there was no hope of extraction and that their odds of survival, much less completion, rapidly diminished with every passing hour. The Yuuzhan Vong continued to whittle away at the strike team, culminating in an ambush inside a city built for slaves they were housing on the worldship. Solo received a heavy amphistaff blow and went down, prompting Anakin to battle his way to her rescue. He was stabbed by an amphistaff in the process and two more Jedi, Drark and [[Eryl Besa]], were slain by the Yuuzhan Vong. Anakin did save her, though she immediately chided him for doing something so rash. Her youngest brother then ordered the team to press on despite the severity of his injury.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nAnakin's wound eventually forced them to come to a halt while their healer [[Tekli]] treated him, but the delaying action they fought cost the Jedi the life of the [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] Jedi [[Bela Hara]]. Solo continued to battle against the Yuuzhan Vong, but despite the number of warriors and voxyn she and the others killed, the Yuuzhan Vong kept coming. They took a shortcut through feral voxyn nests to escape the Yuuzhan Vong warriors, though Solo nearly encountered a Yuuzhan Vong hunting party led by [[Vergere]], a [[Fosh]] who had been the familiar or pet of a deception priestess. Vergere used the Force to sense Solo, which startled her, but did not immediately pursue her, as Solo dropped a flechette mine and departed.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nAnother Barabel fell and Raynar Thul was wounded as the strike team breached the central arena where the voxyn cloning facility was, and Anakin continued to weaken. He ordered the team to retreat through a tunnel and they planned to use a derelict but functional starship, the ''[[Tachyon Flier]]'', to escape the worldship. However, Lomi Plo and Welk stole the ship and escaped, taking with them an injured Raynar Thul. The strike team pressed forward, attacked on all sides by Yuuzhan Vong. At that point, they fell back, but Anakin charged despite his severe injury. He battled through the warriors even as Solo and the other Jedi attempted to cover his wild charge. Even as he was wounded repeatedly, he managed to fight his way through and hurl a detonator onto a pod filled with voxyn tissue samples that could be used to clone more voxyn. That was his last act, as the massive amount of Force energy he used to sustain himself finally burned out and he died. His death sent Solo into a dark rage even as the strike team survivors retreated.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nSolo could not remain idle and returned to retrieve the body of her brother. Setting up an ambush, she and a number of others picked out Yuuzhan Vong targets while Solo targeted Vergere. When the coordinated blasts were unleashed from their weapons, Zekk knocked her weapon aside, claiming that Vergere was an innocent. Solo disagreed vehemently, ordering him to get out of her way as she jumped down to battle through the few warriors around Anakin's body. One attempted to slice her brother's body, but Solo's anger manifested itself in the form of [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]], slaying the warrior. She then directed her attack at Vergere, but the feathered alien used Anakin's lightsaber to deflect the lightning, then retreated. Solo claimed her brother's body and then stole a Yuuzhan Vong assault shuttle, using it to attack a group of Yuuzhan Vong around the frigate that had brought Vergere and the Yuuzhan Vong agent [[Nom Anor]] along with the warriors that had chased them. Her actions cleared the way for her brother and the other survivors to destroy the voxyn queen. The frigate returned fire, though, damaging her shuttle. Solo crash-landed the ship without further casualties. Still burning with anger, Solo contributed to the defense as more Yuuzhan Vong attempted to take the remaining Jedi captive.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nIn the mean time, Jacen and the others were able to capture the frigate [[Trickster|''Ksstarr'']], but while the rest of the Jedi captured the frigate and extracted Solo and her party, Jacen was separated while dealing with the queen. Under fire from more Yuuzhan Vong vessels, Solo was forced to retreat, believing her other brother was dead as well at the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong. She did not want to, and could not even vocalize the order, but the others understood her intention and had their stolen frigate withdraw. Though Jacen was actually a prisoner, she had no way of knowing that.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> Solo helped defend the frigate from Yuuzhan Vong attacks, even though her own heart felt broken at the loss of her brothers. She taught Ganner Rhysode how to fire the frigate's weaponry, then took command of the ship over the objections of Zekk, who feared her anger had turned her to the dark side.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nOnce they were safely in hyperspace, bound for Coruscant, Solo took the time to confront Zekk, asking if he still trusted her and tacitly blaming disunity for the losses among the Jedi during the mission on Myrkr. Zekk replied that she couldn't blame Jacen for Anakin's death, nor herself for Jacen's disappearance. Solo refused to be comforted though. In mid-flight, Tekli approached her and asked if setting course for Coruscant while in a Yuuzhan Vong vessel was wise. The alternate destination of [[Gallinore]], in the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]], was suggested and Solo agreed that it was a better choice. They dropped out of hyperspace further from Coruscant than planned, intent on heading for Gallinore.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nWith Coruscant [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|captured]] by the Yuuzhan Vong, Solo encountered the aftermath of the battle, her ship caught in a crossfire between Yuuzhan Vong and fleeing New Republic forces. Her parents were still in the area and discerned that she was aboard the frigate, which allowed them to remove New Republic pursuit from her ship. Jumping back into hyperspace again, Solo led the remnants of the Jedi strike force to the Gallinore. While en route, she used that time to heal and begin thinking about a mission to rescue Jacen.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\n====Hapan intrigue====\n{{Quote|You can call me 'Great One'. Most people do.|Jaina Solo to Tenel Ka|The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way}}\nUpon arrival over Hapes, the ship was attacked by the Hapans, who believed it was controlled by the Yuuzhan Vong. Solo dispatched Tenel Ka, whose mother was the Queen Mother of Hapes, along with Rhysode, in an escape pod to arrange their safe passage. After fending off the [[Hornet-class interceptor|Hornet Interceptors]] that attacked them, Solo was able to salvage one of their communication units and used it to contact the Hapans. She was answered by [[Ta'a Chume]], the former Queen Mother of Hapes, who promised them safe landing and that they would be her guests. While they were still aboard the ship, Solo found a communications villip, which she used to speak with Tsavong Lah. Lah threatened to capture her and have her sacrificed to their gods, but Solo taunted him and a deception sect priest, [[Harrar]], who was set to preside over her sacrifice. She further misled them into trying to make contact with the ship even while she had Lowbacca block the signal telling them where their captured frigate was. She also renamed the ship ''Trickster'' at this point, choosing it as an insult to the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina_19_(2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Solo in the thralls of the dark side.]]\nWhen the ''Trickster'' did not hear from Tenel Ka, Solo sensed that her friend had been taken aboard a large Hapan ship. She gave chase, but just as she started the frigate towards the other vessel, she felt a sensation in the Force that seemed like Jacen had been killed. The emotional shock overwhelmed her temporarily, but she soon returned to reality, focusing on locating Tenel Ka. Solo boarded the ship and some of the Jedi assisted Tenel Ka in taking down the pirates who had attempted to capture her. Solo continued to stay in charge, sending Zekk and Tenel Ka ahead with the seized Hapan ship. Her assertive tendencies and lack of qualms about violence and vengeance worried the others, but they tolerated her behavior while observing her closely. With an escort from the freshly arrived Jagged Fel and Kyp Durron, both ships were able to land safely.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nShe met her parents at a refugee camp, while arranging for transport for Anakin's body. Solo apologized to her mother for not being able to retrieve Jacen, but Leia insisted that her other son was still alive. Solo did not agree with them, but her father admonished her to not judge her mother. Solo then departed, seeking privacy and isolation so she could grieve. She made her way to the gardens of Ta'a Chume, only to be found by Ta'a Chume herself. The former Queen Mother invited her to a diplomatic dinner, and suggested that&mdash;after properly adorned&mdash;Solo could use her beauty to win the support of the Hapan military in order to avenge her brothers.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nSolo agreed to attend the banquet and conversed with Fel there, feeling a swell of attraction for the other pilot as he spoke. They danced until Ta'a Chume interrupted, asking to speak with Solo alone. Chume spoke to her of the current Queen Mother, Teneniel Djo, and her ailing health. Solo realized that Chume was leading up to ask her to serve as an intermediary to help arrange a marriage between her mother and Djo's husband, Prince [[Isolder]]. She immediately rejected that idea and left. Unbeknown to her, Chume was planning on linking ''her'' with Isolder and decided to manipulate both of them into a marriage.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nLater at the dinner, she ran into Kyp Durron, who insisted that she change into Jedi robes and accompany him to her brother's funeral. While seething at him, Solo complied. She attended the funeral, listening as friends and family of Anakin reminisced over him before his body was cremated. Solo kept her distance from Zekk, who informed her that he would be leaving shortly, as well as from Durron, whom she still resented.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nThe next day found her and Lowbacca working to restore ''Trickster'' to health. Fel came to see her, seeking to recruit her help in scouting Hapan space for Yuuzhan Vong. Solo rudely replied that she had a ship of her own, some of her irritation stemming from her disheveled appearance. Fel left while Solo continued on her work in a huff. Her mother visited and asked her while she was so hard to sense in the Force. Solo replied that she was keeping herself and the emotional burden she carried closed off, rejecting any offer of support that Leia offered. Leia then changed subjects, asking Solo about her work. Solo told her about the modifications she was making to ''Trickster'' to allow it to convey misinformation to the Yuuzhan Vong in the middle of a battle. Fel later returned, asking for an apology for her behavior earlier. Solo spurned him and denied any rumors of her joining his squadron as Durron had done. She then continued working on the frigate with Lowbacca.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nWhen her work was finished for the day, Solo obtained an audience with Chume, seeking to obtain some of the pirates that had been captured after trying to kidnap Tenel Ka for questioning. Chume gave her assent to take some of the pirates to the bio-engineers on Gallinore for experimentation with Yuuzhan Vong slave implant devices and suggested she take someone with her. Due to his lack of scruples, Solo chose to ask Durron, who agreed to go, and also brought Tenel Ka and Lowbacca.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nDuring the flight, Solo agreed to become Durron's apprentice, though she did not want him to make that public knowledge. He agreed to her terms. Upon arrival on Gallinore, she sought out a scientist named [[Sinsor Khal]].<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> Contacting Khal discreetly, Solo learned from the scientist that he could find ways to reverse-engineer the slave seeds if he had a prisoner implanted with a seed made available to him. In order to more fully understand Yuuzhan Vong slave seed technology, Solo took a pirate&mdash;one of three who had attacked the group of Jedi upon entering Hapan space&mdash;and along with Kyp Durron, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca, took him to Khal for him to \"experiment\" on in order to discern the nature of the Yuuzhan Vong biots. Solo did not reveal her true purpose to the other Jedi except Durron, knowing that they would not understand her methods. Tenel Ka asked her why she was associating herself with Durron after the events at Sernpidal earlier in the war, and Solo explained that she needed to learn certain skills from him.<ref name=\"The Apprentice\" />\n\nWith the unknowing help of Lowbacca, she and Durron covertly brought Khal the prisoner for his experimentation. Though the man attempted to escape en route, Solo subdued him with Force lightning. The technique set off an alarm, though, flooding the corridor they were in with coolant. She, Durron, and their prisoner managed to escape the flood into a guarded area, but Durron quickly rendered the guards unconscious, allowing them to transport their cargo to Khal. Solo also learned to wipe memories from Durron, and wiped Lowbacca's after she had him remove her presence from the security records so that nobody would know of her handing a prisoner over to Khal's experimentation.<ref name=\"The Apprentice\" />\n\nHaving been promised results by Khal the next day, Solo spent time conditioning with Lowbacca and Tenel Ka in Gallinore's wilds. After obtaining the altered slave seeds from Khal, she returned to Hapes to complete her modifications to the captured Yuuzhan Vong frigate. While there, she obtained additional promises of support from Ta'a Chume, though Tenel Ka warned her about trusting the old woman. She also conversed with Fel again, who gave her a message from her parents, who had left after Han was injured in a brawl. Fel also echoed Tenel Ka's warning against Ta'a Chume.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina-The_Apprentice.jpg|thumb|left|200px|As Kyp's apprentice, Jaina learns to wipe memories.]]\nBy closely examining ''Trickster'', Solo, along with Lowbacca, realized a fundamental underpinning of [[Yuuzhan Vong]] spacefaring technology&mdash;bodies in space were recognized by their unique gravitic signature. She began exploring plans to use that knowledge against the Yuuzhan Vong. Solo had realized that the dovin basal had some markings on it that symbolized the ''Trickster.'' She made copies of it and put them on ships piloted by Hapan pilots, giving them the gravitic signature of the ''Trickster''. Her tests proved successful, at a cost in Hapan pilots. Her deceptive tactics wreaked havoc with the enemy's ability to identify friends and foes, and she had pilots test them against Yuuzhan Vong patrols, seeking a way to fool the Yuuzhan Vong's sensors from reading the proper ship signatures. She also sent some of the technology she was engineering to Kashyyyk for further improvement.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nWhen Durron found out about her deeds, he was furious. She replied that she was merely following his example and doing what was necessary. He insisted that she stop, which caused her to pull her lightsaber on him. They dueled briefly over the fate of the next flight she intended to launch to test her theories. However, it ended when Durron offered to fly the mission himself. Solo relented and as Durron left, Fel arrived and warned her not to marry Prince Isolder. Solo took imagined offense at his every word, turning them into insults and sent him packing quickly as she prepared to launch her frigate for the next test of her deceptive tactics. As it turned out, the Yuuzhan Vong had brought a sizable fleet, intent on capturing her.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nIn the [[Battle of Hapes (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Hapes]], the ''Trickster ''fought against the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, using the decoy dovin basal signatures to cause the Yuuzhan Vong vessels to fire on each other. The Yuuzhan Vong, their numbers diminished, retreated, and Solo and the others were hailed as heroes on their return. Solo was then bluntly asked by Ta'a Chume to marry Isolder. Solo didn't openly reject the offer&mdash;as that would have been unwise. Instead, she looked for Fel, to ask him about the fight that had caused her parents to leave. Unable to locate him, she tried to use the Force to search him out, only to have a vision of her killing her brother Jacen while he was wearing Darth Vader's armor. Durron found her and brought her out of the vision, telling her that he understood what she had gone through, the vision of the darkness within her. Solo realized she had crossed too many moral lines already and resolved to keep fighting the Yuuzhan Vong, but this time in an ethical manner. She also realized that she was attracted to Jag Fel and used that attraction to find him via her nascent Force connection with him. He had been detained on the orders of Ta'a Chume, but Solo and Durron freed him. He told them that an attempt on Teneniel Djo's life was likely. They raced to the Queen Mother, but found her dead of poison.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nTa'a Chume seemed triumphant as she announced that a new queen would soon be chosen, but Tenel Ka agreed to take her mother's place as Queen Mother of Hapes and Solo backed her. Meanwhile, Yuuzhan Vong forces approached Hapes, prompting Tenel Ka to reveal a rebuilt Hapan fleet which she placed under Fel's command. Solo then took her frigate into space. Durron attempted to dissuade her from going, fearing she would throw her life away, but Solo outmaneuvered him, leaving him on the ground while she flew ''Trickster'' into combat. Solo fought well, but her ship was outgunned. During the battle, she had another Force vision of her fighting against someone in Darth Vader's armor, this time Kyp Durron. In fact, the Jedi Master had flown to her aid and been forced to eject from his fighter. Realizing that she would accomplish nothing further by seeking more vengeance at this time, she retrieved Durron and withdrew as the new Hapan fleet dealt with the remaining Yuuzhan Vong vessels.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nAfter the battle, Solo was approached by Ta'a Chume, who expressed regret that Solo hadn't agreed to become Queen of Hapes. Solo disdained the old woman, who was soon arrested and asked Durron where they were headed next. He said he was going to meet with Luke Skywalker to patch up their differences and she agreed to go with him.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\nFollowing her success with deceptive tactics at Hapes, Solo's reputation began to grow thanks to crafty disinformation spread by [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] agents. Because of her role in deceiving them, as well as subsequent disinformation by the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]], the horrified Yuuzhan Vong began to believe that Jaina Solo was [[Yun-Harla]], the Goddess of Deception. It was something New Republic commanders wholeheartedly encouraged by referring to her as \"Goddess\", \"Great One\", and similar.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref>\n\n====Trickster goddess====\n{{Quote|I'm not afraid of dying. I'm afraid of surviving&hellip; and getting to the end of the war and discovering that I'm all alone. That everyone I knew and cared for is gone.|Jaina Solo|The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream}}\nFollowing the loss of Coruscant, the remnants of the [[New Republic Advisory Council]] gathered at [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]] in [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]]. The New Republic forces there under Wedge Antilles attempted to regroup and began formulating plans for defeating the Yuuzhan Vong threat, starting with [[Battle of Borleias (Yuuzhan Vong War; Second)|defending]] Borleias. On one occasion, they used the \"[[Starlancer Project|Starlancer]]\" to fire a laser beam through hyperspace on [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]]'s flagship as a lure for the Yuuzhan Vong. During this time, Solo arrived from Hapes along with several of the other Myrkr strike team survivors, Durron, and Jag Fel. After discussing her role on Borleias with her uncle, Antilles, and her parents, she was given command of an elite fighter unit known as [[Twin Suns Squadron]], originally founded by Luke Skywalker. The unit included pilots such as Kyp Durron and Jagged Fel. As part of her new concept for the squadron, Solo worked on developing Force-based coordination with Durron in order to quickly eliminate Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\nWhile on a practice run to test their coordination, Solo detected a disturbance in the Force. Turning her flight, composed of Fel, Durron, and herself, to investigate, she found that a [[Domain Hul|sizable Yuuzhan Vong fleet]] was approaching Borleias. As she and her pilots closed on the nearest frigate, it spewed numerous civilian hostages into space. While Yuuzhan Vong ooglith masquers protected them from vacuum, the Yuuzhan Vong intended for the hostages to burn up when they re-entered Borleias's atmosphere. Based on an idea of Fel's, Solo's flight was able to save them from such a fate by vectoring their fighters into their paths; the subsequent low-speed collisions altered the hostages' trajectories so they could be rescued. The arrival of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, however, signified that the invaders' campaign against Borleias had intensified.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\nAfter that, Solo learned of a mission to Coruscant that Luke Skywalker was masterminding. His mission had two purposes: to investigate what the Yuuzhan Vong were doing there and to also see if Jacen was still alive. Solo originally intended to go, but was dissuaded by Tahiri Veila, who warned her that if Jacen was alive, Solo's presence would only endanger the mission due to the Yuuzhan Vong obsession with twins. Instead, Veila volunteered to go on the mission. She also told Solo that it would be best for her to make amends with her mother, from whom Solo had emotionally isolated herself. Solo had been trying to close off her attachments to others in an attempt to lessen the impact of what she believed was her eventual death, but she did concede that Veila was right.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\n[[File:Jainasolo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jaina Solo, pretending to be the Trickster Goddess.]]\nAlso while on Borleias, Antilles encouraged her to use the Yuuzhan Vong belief that she was an incarnation of Yun-Harla for psychological warfare. A group of [[Wraith Squadron]] members including [[Sharr Latt]] and [[Voort saBinring]] helped Solo develop her \"Goddess\" moniker and persona, creating the personification of Yun-Harla for the Yuuzhan Vong. She was given special privileges and even a porter in the form of Durron to enhance the illusion that Solo indeed held deified status among both the New Republic and the Yuuzhan Vong. Though Solo initially disliked being called the \"Goddess,\" she accepted that it was necessary for her to mimic the Yuuzhan Vong goddess Yun-Harla as part of a prolonged psychological warfare operation against the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" /> She was also referred to by other similar titles, including \"Great One.\"<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref>\n\nIn the mean time, Solo and her Twin Suns participated in the Starlancer Project by covering the starfighters that composed the plan. However, when the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to attack the fighters, Antilles and his staff were unprepared for the object of their assault to be Solo, not the [[Pipefighter|Starlancer vehicles]]. Battling through numerous coralskippers, Solo and her squadron were nevertheless surrounded by a wave of Yuuzhan Vong craft. Fel devised a novel tactic wherein he would fly back through the Yuuzhan Vong ships while Solo and Durron kept two Jedi shadow bombs behind him until the last minut, when they would hurtle them into the [[Vua'spar interdictor|interdictors]] pinning the squadron in place. Fel's maneuver was successful in destroying one of the Yuuzhan Vong interdictors, but a gravitic singularity sent him off-course and he was pursued by numerous coralskippers. While the rest of her squadron jumped to safety, Solo refused to leave Fel and Durron in turn refused to leave her. Disobeying direct orders from Colonel Celchu, she and Durron returned to the fray and Durron employed an exhausting Force technique to turn the second interdictor's gravity wells against it, crushing it. The surviving coralskippers tried to pursue them, but Fel, Durron, and Solo were able to escape to the safety of the frigate ''[[Lunar Tide]]'' and Rogue Squadron.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\nUpon her return to the base, Solo was immediately called to see General Antilles. She expected a stern debriefing from the officer, but before she met with Antilles, she was confronted by Fel. Solo expected him to chide her as well, but he instead asked her why she had risked her life to save him. Her response was \"Everyone is going away. They keep going away and I can't stop it. I didn't want you to go away.\" She began crying, at which point Fel embraced her, assured her that he wasn't going anywhere and kissed her. He then met with Antilles in her stead and was able to avert any disciplinary action towards Solo.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\nNot long afterward, Solo made amends with her mother after Leia returned from a mission ferrying young trainees to a Jedi facility hidden in the [[The Maw|Maw Cluster]]. Between that reconciliation and the sparking of a relationship with Fel, she became more emotionally stable. Shortly thereafter, the Yuuzhan Vong launched a major ground offensive against the Borleias garrison the next day. As she was running to her X-wing, Solo was confronted by a distressed civilian male, [[Tam Elgrin]], who had been forced to serve as Yuuzhan Vong spy. He confessed his duplicity to her despite severe physical pain, prompting her to call for medical assistance and then run to her fighter so she could participate in the defense.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\nSolo and Twin Suns helped defend against the push, including using another tactic where Fel once again guided two shadow bombs into position to knock out Yuuzhan Vong rakamats, but they were repeatedly ordered to retreat to avoid being cut off from other New Republic forces. Once the New Republic forces had withdrawn into a tight cordon around their central facility, Antilles unleashed his surprise; [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]] by the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]'' to annihilate the Yuuzhan Vong approach. This punishing action bought the garrison a brief respite while the Yuuzhan Vong replenished their losses.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong soon returned, though, harassing incoming and outgoing convoys with coralskipper attacks. Solo and the Twin Suns helped provide cover for these supply ships, including the transport ''[[Reckless Abandon]]''. While defending against the Yuuzhan Vong marauders, Solo was irked to be the subject of [[Taanab Yellow Aces]] leader [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson's]] flirtations, but after Janson learned her identity, he abandoned any advances he had been considering. Solo also helped defend against a midnight attack by the Yuuzhan Vong that employed two light cruiser analogs as artillery against the central New Republic facility. At this point, Solo unleashed one of her new weapons, a missile that fired proton torpedo decoys at the Yuuzhan Vong to divert their defensive dovin basals. While the defenses tried to shield the ship against the decoys, Solo and her wingmates fired four proton torpedoes that mortally wounded one of the ships. This and the loss of numerous coralskippers caused the Yuuzhan Vong to retreat. They continued to wage a war of attrition against the garrison, which Solo and her pilots did their best to counter. As part of the deception that Solo was an avatar of Yun-Harla, the Twin Suns were afforded numerous privileges, including a private mess and full proton torpedo loads. These benefits were largely unexplained to the rest of the New Republic forces, which generated some measure of ill will among other squadrons not in on the full plan.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]''</ref>\n\nIn between missions, Solo continued to deepen her relationship with Fel, and also recruited, on his suggestion, a Mon Calamari pilot named [[Beelyath]] into her squadron to assist with some of her deceptive tactics involving a [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter/Legends|B-wing starfighter]]. She also called Durron to a late night picnic with her and Fel; Durron had been closing himself off emotionally from her, much as she had done before her mother's advice had encouraged her to open up to those who cared for her. She, Fel, and Durron were able to reach an understanding where Durron served as her mission partner and would fly alongside her, while also acknowledging that she and Fel were romantically involved.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\" />\n\nEventually, the Yuuzhan Vong launched an all-out assault to take the planet Borleias after weeks of constant harassment. Antilles was prepared for this, though, and dictated the timing of the push by launching the supposedly-finished Starlancer fighters. The Starlancer project represented a threat to the Yuuzhan Vong worldships and forced them to respond, but little did they know that the entire Starlancer project was a deception.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\" />\n\nSolo and her Twin Suns briefly defended one of the Starlancer pipefighters, but soon abandoned the craft to rendezvous with ''Lusankya'', which had emerged from hyperspace near the main Yuuzhan Vong worldship at Borleias. The Twin Suns along with the other elite starfighter units of the New Republic, guarded the mammoth warship as it closed on the worldship in a ramming attempt. Yuuzhan Vong forces attempted to capture Solo, but she used gravitic alterations to her craft to change her identity while Beelyath fired a [[Goddess missile|missile]] that emulated her signature. This lured several skilled Yuuzhan Vong pilots to their doom while Solo continued to protect the ''Lusankya.'' The Star Dreadnaught was successful in ramming and destroying the worldship and though the Yuuzhan Vong claimed Borleias, the victory was Pyrrhic as they lost a worldship, numerous warships, and the famed tactician [[Czulkang Lah]] in the process. For her part, Solo and the [[Fleet Group Three|rest of the New Republic forces]] withdrew from the battle after the worldship was destroyed, bound for Mon Calamari.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\" />\n\nLater that year, Jedi Knight Ganner Rhysode told her that he'd heard a rumor that Jacen was still alive. Solo, who had felt Jacen's presence in the Force die, flatly denied that rumor, despite her mother's claims that Jacen was still alive. Solo also told Rhysode to keep his mouth shut and not tell anyone or investigate the matter, or else face her wrath.<ref name=\"Traitor\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Traitor]]''</ref>\n\n====Sword of the Jedi====\n{{Quote|Even being a Jedi is something where you look for more.

This meant that aces such as Kyp Durron and Jagged Fel were rotated out of Twin Suns, though as a consolation, Solo received a promotion to brevet [[Major/Legends|Major]].<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nAs part of her new command, Solo helped plan the [[Second Battle of Obroa-skai]] in an attempt to kill the Yuuzhan Vong [[Supreme Overlord]], with the aid of the Hapans and General [[Keyan Farlander/Legends|Keyan Farlander's]] fleet. She commanded her captured Yuuzhan Vong frigate ''Trickster'' in this battle, jumping into the system with a New Republic fleet behind her ship as if in pursuit. In doing so, Solo appealed towards the Yuuzhan Vong tendency towards aggression, which left the flagship vulnerable to attack while the New Republic employed new weapons such as a [[Gravitic amplitude modulator|yammosk jammer]] to disrupt the Yuuzhan Vong war coordinators. After the first yammosk jamming failed to have much effect on the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, Solo correctly deduced that there was a second yammosk coordinating the Yuuzhan Vong forces after they jammed the first one. That other yammosk was quickly jammed, allowing the New Republic fleet to have an edge in synchronization over the Yuuzhan Vong. Meanwhile, Solo flew her frigate to the rear of the enemy line, seeding decoy dovin basals that persuaded Yuuzhan Vong ships to fire on each other. She then fired on the flagship, just as Hapan reinforcements arrived to finish off the weakened rear of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet. The battle was successful to the point of a rout, but Supreme Overlord [[Shimrra Jamaane]] wasn't among the fleet that was destroyed and Solo was frustrated by what she viewed as a failure, though she was glad to see Tenel Ka again.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nSolo then returned as ordered along with Farlander to Kashyyyk where she and Farlander met with his superior, Admiral Traest Kre'fey. Kre'fey congratulated them on their victory, and then informed them that the Bothans had enacted [[ar'krai]], a state of total war, on the Yuuzhan Vong. Kre'fey also informed Solo of her brother's survival and return to Mon Calamari. She was pleased at hethe aring of Jacen's survival, ut also wondered how she would explain her dark-side-laced actions during his absence to him.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nShortly afterward, Solo and her Twin Suns were out on a training exercise with Colonel [[Ijix Harona]]'s [[Scimitar Squadron (New Republic)|Scimitar Squadron]] when they received a distress call from a New Republic capital ship that had been damaged in the Battle of Obroa-skai. Flying to the aid of the ''[[Far Thunder]]'' and its escort ''[[Whip Hand]]'', Solo and her pilots helped deal with the harassing coralskippers long enough for the cruiser to be evacuated and scuttled.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the loss of Borleias forced the New Republic to flee to the ocean world of Dac in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. It was on this planet that Solo was sent on temporary leave by Kre'fey and reunited with her brother Jacen. She was also given the assignment of asking her uncle for more Jedi to help with fleet coordination. Solo, however, did not enjoy her break from active duty, wanting to return to Kashyyyk with Kre'fey's fleet and continue fighting in the war. During her meditations with her brother, she did not enjoy anything that didn't prepare her for facing the Yuuzhan Vong again.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nShe was present for a Knighting ceremony where she, Jacen, and several other survivors of the Myrkr strike team were recognized as Jedi Knights by the newly reformed [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]]. Solo was named \"the Sword of the Jedi\" by her uncle, a role she took seriously. In giving her this title, Skywalker declared that she would always be on the front lines, purposeful, and determined; restless, but protecting others. However, it sometimes caused her some grief, as she sometimes felt she was meant not to love anyone or be close to anyone, particularly after the loss of so many friends and comrades during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Having collected more Jedi to assist Kre'fey and learned new tactics, she cut short her leave and returned to Kashyyyk and the war.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nOver the next few months, Solo flew with Kre'fey's fleet in a series of harrowing raids and skirmishes on the Yuuzhan Vong, including one against [[Raid on Duro|Duro]]. During these fights, she and her pilots garnered experience for the pilots in her command as part of the retired Mon Calamari strategist Ackbar's plan to smash the Vong war fleet. This campaign culminated in the [[Battle of Ebaq]]. Solo and some of the other Jedi were alleged to be on the moon defending the newly-formed government, though it was actually a trap for the Yuuzhan Vong, as Ebaq 9 was a dead end in hyperspace with no way of escape. While a massive Yuuzhan Vong fleet attacked the base, New Republic groups flanked, surrounded, and carved apart their vessels while luring them through minefields as part of a trap. Solo and her squadron initially helped Farlander's fleet that was stationed over the moon, but after prolonged combat against the Yuuzhan Vong and sustaining casualties, was ordered to withdraw.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nAs the battle raged outside, Solo and the other Twin Suns, including Tesar Sebatyne and Lowbacca, flew to the moon and waited inside. While the combined fleets of Kre'fey, Farlander, Han Solo, and Garm Bel Iblis pounded the Yuuzhan Vong in space, Tsavong Lah landed on the world with ten thousand warriors, intent on slaying or capturing all the Jedi. Solo and her pilots fought a delaying action, using mines, blasters, and the Force to whittle down the Yuuzhan Vong and their voxyn. Retreating up a mine shaft, Solo, Tesar, and Lowbacca were cornered, but determined to fight on. It was then that Vergere sacrificed her life to wipe out most of the Yuuzhan Vong forces on the barren moon, though Tsavong Lah survived to ambush them. With her companions and her feet pinned by [[blorash jelly]], Solo fought [[Tsavong Lah]] in a one-on-one duel and slew him by stabbing her purple lightsaber blade through his throat.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nAfter the battle was over, the Yuuzhan Vong had lost Lah and the bulk of their fleet. Solo and the rest of the Jedi escaped casualties and she was ferried off the moon along with her companions after the victory to move on to the next theater of war. Following the New Republic victory, newly-elected [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Cal Omas]] had the New Republic reorganized as the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]], also known as the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] for short. Governmental changes between the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance included a new constitution, a stronger judicial branch, and a better system of checks and balances that curbed the power that under the New Republic had been almost exclusively in the hands of the Senate.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nIn [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]], Major Solo participated in a number of follow-up raids after the Battle of Ebaq 9 as part of ''Ralroost''{{'s}} fleet. Partnered with her brother Jacen, Saba Sebatyne, and several other Jedi, Solo was pleased with the success of the raids, but wanted propagate the conflict against Yuuzhan Vong further. Kre'fey announced that their destination was the Peace Brigade capital of [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]], and though the Bothan admiral planned on striking from orbit, the Jedi advocated for capturing and placing the Peace Brigade leaders on trial, to maximize the propaganda victory and reduce civilian casualties. While she was planning the mission and helping train her pilots, Solo was surprised by Fel, who had arrived with his squadron to get repairs at Kre'fey's fleet. Having detected some ambiguity in Solo's messages to him, Fel decided to see how she still felt about him. He sneaked into her cabin and kissed her when she entered, which Solo enjoyed for a moment before she remembered to resist and hurled him across the room with the Force. However, she was pleased to see him, spending time with him and taking large amounts of his money in [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]]. He also agreed to assist with the assault on Ylesia.<ref name=\"Ylesia\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Ylesia]]''</ref>\n\nSolo volunteered to lead the ground component of the [[Battle of Ylesia (28 ABY)|assault on]] [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]], supervising the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] forces, while [[Tigran Jamiro/Legends|Tigran Jamiro]] led the conventional military forces of the Galactic Alliance. However, first, Kre'fey's fleet had to clear Yuuzhan Vong and Peace Brigade naval forces. Solo led her Twin Suns squadron into battle against the Peace Brigade flotilla, who proved to be no match for the disciplined and well-equipped Galactic Alliance Fleet. Twins Suns Squadron was then tasked with clearing the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]], but drew off to engage a Yuuzhan Vong coralskipper force attempting to attack the ground troops. After destroying the coralskippers, Solo and her squadron moved in to cover the landing.<ref name=\"Ylesia\" />\n\nAs the ground troops landed, Solo soon joined them. She found her second cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo, the Peace Brigade leader, had already been captured after attempting to pose as a civilian. Since Sal-Solo claimed that he wasn't a willing participant in Peace Brigade activities, Solo decided to compel his assistance as a guide so they could capture the rest of the Peace Brigade leadership. En route, she helped deal with Peace Brigade defenders, who were no match for her and Lowbacca, combined with the Galactic Alliance ground troops. They soon reached the central shelter where the Peace Brigaders were hiding, and Solo insisted that Sal-Solo call for the surrender of the government. They refused to heed his call, so the Galactic Alliance forces blew the door and went in after them. Solo and Lowbacca led the way, subduing all resistance by capturing the Peace Brigade government, including renegade Senator [[Pwoe]].<ref name=\"Ylesia\" />\n\nThe arrival of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet forced a hasty withdrawal back to the landing zone for departure to Kre'fey's fleet, but the remaining Yuuzhan Vong ground forces ambushed the speeder convoy as they arrived. Solo battled to defend the convoy in the confused skirmish that resulted, and the arrival of Fel and Twin Suns Squadron as close air support allowed the landing force to escape back to their ships. Kre'fey's fleet retreated after inflicting damage to the Yuuzhan Vong ships in space, having achieved a victory. However, Solo was displeased with how operations had gone on Ylesia, particularly the Yuuzhan Vong ambush, but settled down when Jacen and Fel explained that the Peace Brigade was crippled.<ref name=\"Ylesia\" />\n\n====Unification mission====\n{{Quote|Please don't threaten me. I really don't take too kindly to things like that.|Jaina Solo|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\n[[File:Jainanjo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina Solo circa the [[Battle of Ebaq]]]]\nAfter the Battle of Ebaq, Solo achieved the rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel/Legends|Lieutenant Colonel]] and returned to Mon Calamari, where she was met by Kyp Durron. Solo also inquired about the status of Tahiri Veila, who had left her a message earlier asking to meet with her and was told by Durron that Veila had not come to a recent meeting of the Jedi. Solo met her parents and Fel, listening to them plan out a mission without much interest while Durron left to investigate the whereabouts of Veila. To her surprise, she was assigned to escort her parents on diplomatic missions for the Galactic Alliance. She was not particularly looking forward to the mission as she preferred to be on the front lines, but she did relish the prospect of spending more time with Jagged Fel, who was also accompanying Twin Suns, the [[Pride of Selonia (Lancer-class)|''Pride of Selonia'']], and the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" />\n\nAs the meeting was concluding, Solo received a call from Veila, who seemed frantic and claimed that Anakin Solo wanted her dead. Solo had an intelligence officer who was assisting in the planning, [[Belindi Kalenda]], trace Veila's comlink. With the coordinates obtained, Solo soon found Veila in the care of a medical team, unconscious and bleeding from self-inflicted wounds. At the medcenter where Veila was conveyed, Solo explained what she had heard from Veila and helped Jacen observe her until she awoke. Meanwhile, while waiting for the mission to depart, she sparred with Fel, enjoying spending time with him even as she worked through her frustration at not being on combat duty. She also bid her brother, Luke and Mara Skywalker, and Danni Quee farewell, as they were on a mission of their own to find the sentient planet [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]]. When she had time in between organizing Twin Suns squadron for the diplomatic mission, Solo visited Veila, who was still convalescing, but her spare time was limited. Eventually, to keep an eye on the traumatized young Jedi, Veila was asked by Leia Solo to accompany them on their diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" />\n\nAfter they departed, Solo learned that the Imperial Remnant had been attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong, and also listened to her parents debate the mission's first stop, the [[Koornacht Cluster/Legends|Koornacht Cluster]]. Their first layover was at [[Galantos]], where the mission re-established contact with the native [[Fian|Fia]] and tried to learn the status of the Yevetha in the nearby Koornacht Cluster. Solo grew increasingly worried about Veila, though, as she had taken to wandering around mindlessly or collapsing suddenly, in addition to being frail and ailing. Solo also observed a holo of Veila eluding a number of escorts while on Galantos and finding some kind of object. Veila's reaction to it was startling and elicited a wild defense with a lightsaber by Veila against anyone who approached her before fainting to the ground. At that point, Solo grew even more concerned about Veila, but with the younger Jedi unconscious again, there was little she could do.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" />\n\nSolo also learned from the ground party that the Yevetha were no longer a concern to the Fia. Solo then volunteered to probe the edges of the Koornacht Cluster to see the reason for their nonchalance about the Yevetha. On her scouting trip to the Yevethan homeworld of [[N'zoth]], Solo and her flight found that the world had been totally pounded flat, with no trace of civilization. Then, she found a single surviving Yevethan pilot, but the fanatical alien destroyed his own ship in a murderous suicide, causing severe damage to her craft and killing another of her pilots. She nursed her crippled X-wing back to Galantos as the Yuuzhan Vong arrived with a small fleet to enslave the world. The Fia had made a deal with the Yuuzhan Vong to destroy the Yevetha in exchange for peace, not knowing that the invaders planned on enslaving them as well. The resulting action between Galactic Alliance and Yuuzhan Vong, with the Galactic Alliance Forces eventually aided by a few Fia defenders, was the [[Battle of Galantos]]. Solo avoided the majority of the dogfight, as her craft was already damaged. Instead, she worked on disabling the slaveships that the Yuuzhan Vong had brought with them. They were successful and the Fia renounced all ties to the Peace Brigade and Yuuzhan Vong in favor of the Galactic Alliance. After Solo had rested, Fel told her about Jacen helping the Empire fend off a Yuuzhan Vong attack and additionally showed her the Yuuzhan Vong pendant that Tahiri had discovered on Galantos which had triggered her reaction. Solo then began to realize that Tahiri was still having issues with her having been shaped by the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" />\n\nThe next stop on the diplomatic mission was to Bakura based on information gathered from a Ryn [[Unidentified Ryn|informant]] by Solo's parents.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" /> Upon arrival over Bakura, Solo was part of a group of Twin Suns pilots deployed to escort the ''Pride of Selonia'' and the ''Millennium Falcon'' into orbit around Bakura. A Bakuran cruiser, [[Sentinel (Bakura-class)|''Sentinel'']], suddenly deployed a swarm of [[Ssi-ruu]]vi battle droids from its hold after someone hijacked Leia's transmission to the ground, but though Solo prepared her squadron for action, the droids, along with an accompaniment of piloted fighters, proved to be part of an escort. After learning that Bakura was under martial law, the expedition docked with ''Sentinel''. Solo along with her parents, Veila, and an honor guard met the Bakuran commander of the ship, General [[Grell Panib]]. They were surprised to see a reptilian [[P'w'eck]], a species known to serve the hostile Ssi-ruuk, aboard the ship. Panib quickly explained that the P'w'eck, [[Lwothin]], was part of the [[P'w'eck Emancipation Movement]]. Lwothin told them of a Ssi-ruu of great spiritual significance to their culture, the [[Keeramak]], who had led the oppressed P'w'ecks to overthrow their masters and seek to ally themselves with the Bakurans. The expedition had arrived as the negotiations were coming to a head&mdash;the Keeramak planned to visit Bakura in a few days to consecrate the planet and establish a formal alliance with the Bakurans. The expedition also learned of civil unrest on Bakura over the proposed treaty and the recent disappearance of Bakura's Prime Minister, [[Molierre Cundertol]], from Deputy Prime Minister Blaine Harris. Solo's parents agreed to attend the consecration ceremony, but also resolved to investigate the situation on Bakura further, worrying that the Peace Brigade might have been attempting to sabotage Bakura.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]''</ref>\n\nSolo then accompanied her parents and Veila down to Bakura's surface, where received word via Fel that Cundertol had escaped captivity and returned to Bakura. Any official discussion about matters of state was delayed by celebrations of Cundertol's escape, which irked Solo. Back in their quarters, Veila discovered a message capsule that she had been told about from a Ryn contact. The message it contained said that [[Malinza Thanas]], a local girl who had been imprisoned on charges of instigating unrest and suspicion of kidnapping Cundertol, would have the information they needed. Chafing to do something and knowing she was fairly inconspicuous, Solo volunteered to visit Thanas in prison.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\n[[File:Ssi-Ruu_v_Jedi.jpg|thumb|left|Jaina battles a Ssi-ruu on Bakura.]]\nHer attempts to break into the prison covertly were unsuccessful in accomplishing anything but tripping an alarm, so Solo backed off and bluffed her way into arranging a meeting with Thanas, threatening a diplomatic incident if she didn't get her meeting. The intimidated guards led her to Thanas, whom Solo persuaded to explain why she was under arrest. Thanas told her about the group of nonviolent isolationist activists she was involved with, who had stirred up dissent towards the New Republic. Thanas also explained that she and her group had been digging up information on the sordid deeds of Bakuran senators, including a large offworld money transfer. The imprisoned girl also implied that she would soon be convicted to keep her from leaking the news about the information. Solo resolved to try and help her, but as she turned to go, found that the guards were missing. Thanas took that as an opportunity to escape and a reluctant Solo helped her find her way out of the prison.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nSolo followed Thanas through the city of [[Salis D'aar/Legends|Salis D'aar]] by night as Thanas led her back to the headquarters of her movement, [[Freedom]]. Solo met with some of the other activists, who were as puzzled about Thanas's escape as she was. They resolved to look into the matter further, as well as investigate who had actually kidnapped Cundertol. At that point, they discovered that a homing beacon had been planted on Thanas&mdash;their hideout was about to be surrounded and invaded. The Freedom activists fled and, carrying the beacon, Solo followed one of them, [[Salkeli]], in an attempt to create a false trail. They ditched the bug and, once they had eluded their pursuit, Salkeli offered her a ride back into town on a speeder. She agreed, but it was a ruse, as he stunned her instead. In the mean time, her activities had been noticed by Bakuran security forces, who declared her a suspect and placed a warrant for her arrest.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nWhen Solo awoke, she was still Salkeli's prisoner, and learned that he had sold Freedom out before he stunned her again. She awoke in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Blaine Harris in his private safe room. Harris revealed to her that he was working towards making Bakura independent of the galactic government by supporting the alliance with the P'w'eck. He also lured Thanas and her group of activists to his location, revealing that he'd been using them to help foment his ideals of an independent Bakura. In doing so, Harris informed Thanas that her \"tragic death\" would help rally the people behind him and his cause. Thanas attempted to resist, but Harris was armed with a blaster, killing one of the [[Jjorg|activists]] who attempted to attack him.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nHarris took Solo, Thanas, and the remaining Freedom activist, [[Vyram]], to the consecration ceremony. He then forced Solo to press a remote detonator that would kill Cundertol, her parents, and the Bakuran Senate so Harris could seize power. Solo would then be framed for a slaughter and Thanas would be seen as the loyal citizen who attempted to stop Solo. Harris then locked them in an equipment closet with the bomb while he prepared to escape. Unbeknownst to him, Solo used the Force to warn her parents of the danger. When Harris attempted to use her lightsaber to inflict wounds on Thanas and Vyram to help make his story sound more plausible, Solo snatched it from him telekinetically. Solo and Thanas quickly subdued Harris and Salkeli just as Veila and a Ryn named [[Goure Conor|Goure]] arrived, having traced Solo's use of the Force. Solo sent Veila to disarm the bomb&mdash;the remote detonator had been damaged in the clash&mdash;while Goure tried to free them from the equipment locker. Salkeli informed them that there was no other way to deactivate the bomb. Solo tried to persuade Veila to abandon her attempts to disarm it, but Veila stubbornly continued trying, shouting at Solo in the Yuuzhan Vong language as she defiantly attempted to defuse the bomb.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nIt exploded and Solo freed herself so Thanas could find security and alert them to Harris's plan. She was concerned for Veila, but was relieved to find that her parents had received and heeded her warning. For her part, Solo and Goure searched for Veila, whom they found unconscious, having used a [[Force barrier/Legends|Force bubble]] to protect herself from the bulk of the blast. Solo's parents also informed her via comlink that Cundertol had perished in the explosion. Solo then assisted with the rescue efforts while the P'w'eck resolutely concluded their consecration ceremony.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nToo late, the Solos realized that the treaty was a smokescreen for a Ssi-ruuk attempt at seizing Bakura. As Ssi-ruu troopships began landing, Solo participated in the [[Battle of Bakura (28 ABY)|battle]] from the ground, helping her parents retreat to the ''Millennium Falcon'' in the face of the Ssi-ruu landing force. They fell back through the bomb crater, passing by the equipment locker where Solo had left Vyram and Harris. Solo met Thanas there, who informed her that the exit was blocked. Solo then asked Harris if there was an alternate escape route, but his only response was to bargain for power. Disgusted with his selfishness in the midst of an invasion, Solo ignored him, only to be surprised by the re-appearance of Cundertol. Cundertol questioned Harris about alternate exits, but the irate Deputy Prime Minister said there were none. Cundertol then slew Harris and planted his blaster against the head of Malinza Thanas, revealing himself to be in league with the Ssi-ruuk. A group of the reptilian invaders and the Keeramak soon arrived, offering them to have their life-forces drained to power droids in a process known as [[entechment]]. Solo and the others refused, while Cundertol let slip that he had brokered the bargain with the Ssi-ruuk, as he had already transferred his consciousness into a [[human replica droid]].<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nAt that point, the P'w'eck rebelled against the Ssi-ruuk, slaying the Keeramak. In the confusion, Solo and the others were able to assist in dealing with the Ssi-ruuk and rescuing Thanas from Cundertol. In orbit, the P'w'eck were able to deceive the Ssi-ruu ships into releasing all the prisoners they had seized for entechment, including Jagged Fel. With the captive starfighters released from the tractor beams that had held them in place, Fel, the Galactic Alliance squadrons, and Bakuran fighters, attacked the Ssi-ruu warships with the assistance of P'w'eck droid ships.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\n[[File:Jbig3.jpg|thumb|right|The Sword of the Jedi]]\nWhen Cundertol escaped, Solo pursued him, though his augmented droid body proved difficult to subdue. He hit her with his enhanced strength before she could strike with her lightsaber and escaped again. Her parents found on the ground, in pain from the blow. Han and some P'w'eck pursued Cundertol, while Leia stayed behind to tend to her daughter. Fel and his group of fighters had forced the Ssi-ruuk to surrender and the P'w'eck rebellion had dealt with the reptilian invaders on the surface, ending the battle.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nFor her part, Solo was conveyed back to the ''Pride of Selonia'' for medical treatment, though she was more alarmed to find that Veila was still catatonic, just as she had been since the bomb blast. Cundertol had escaped temporarily&mdash;though he would later fall at the hands of Yuuzhan Vong infiltrators inside the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium&mdash;but Solo was pleased to learn that the P'w'ecks and Bakurans had signed a treaty. Furthermore, Goure confirmed that Veila's Yuuzhan Vong personality was warring with her Human one. The Ryn also suggested killing Veila to stop it, an idea which Solo rejected immediately. A native [[Kurtzen]] healer named [[Arrizza]] attempted a healing ceremony to help with Veila's internal conflict, but there were no immediate results. Instead, Solo and Fel took turns watching her.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nThe expedition journeyed to [[Onadax]] next, based on a tip from the Ryn. Solo and her father independently explored the town, searching for information or another member of the Ryn informant network.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion]]''</ref> Solo also went in search of the engineers who had made Cundertol into a human replica droid, locating their fortified compound on Onadax. The Force allowed her to slip through the outer layers of security with relative ease. When she reached the manufacturing center, she was greeted by the leader of the collective that produced the human replica droids, [[Stanton Rendar]]. Rendar, who had also been transferred into an HRD, made no attempt at confronting her and denied responsibility for Cundertol's actions. He then tried to convince her to accept an HRD body, but she refused. When she declared her intention to shut down his facility, he unleashed ten security droids and escaped while she fought them. With the added threat of a self-destruct thrown in, Solo had no chance of capturing Rendar and just barely escaped the blast.<ref name=\"Or Die Trying\">{{InsiderCite|75|Or Die Trying}}</ref> The explosion only served to instigate an anti-Galactic Alliance mob that was quickly stirred up after her. Cut off from the ''Millennium Falcon'', Solo headed for the ''Pride of Selonia instead'', reaching the ship just seconds before the mob arrived. They lifted off and Solo's parents revealed that they had rescued the Ryn leader [[Droma]] while on Onadax, who asked them to check in at [[Esfandia/Legends|Esfandia]], where the Yuuzhan Vong were attacking the communications relay there. While the ''Pride of Selonia'' headed to Esfandia, Solo helped monitor the comatose Veila, who continued to decline.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\nArriving over Esfandia, the expedition found a Yuuzhan Vong fleet attacking the planet. Vastly outgunned by the Yuuzhan Vong force, they were unsure of what to do when an Imperial fleet under Gilad Pellaeon arrived and began engaging. The ''Pride of Selonia'' flew to assist, but Solo did not participate in the opening engagement&mdash;she had gone into a mind meld with Veila before the battle even began. Solo watched as Veila's personality clashed with her implanted Yuuzhan Vong personality, Riina Kwaad, but every time Veila injured Kwaad, she sustained the same injury. Ultimately, Solo assisted Veila in uniting the two split parts of her personality while both women were comatose. While Solo was unconscious, Fel stayed by her bedside and at one point expressed his love for her, asking her to return, a statement which Solo heard and told him of later.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\nOnce Veila had reunited her disjointed mind, Solo returned to consciousness, with Veila following suit shortly afterward. Fel quickly got her up to speed, telling her that they were in a standoff with the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, while the ''Millennium Falcon'' had gone to ground, seeking the mobile relay base on the surface of Esfandia. Veila proposed posing as a traitor, pretending to give Han and Leia Solo to the Yuuzhan Vong commander and Solo vouched for her, lending credence to the idea. Solo also obtained Imperial support from Pellaeon for the plan, as she was essentially in charge of executing Veila's idea. She, Fel, Veila, and a small party boarded a wrecked Yuuzhan Vong ship with an intact set of villips. Veila was able to deceive the Yuuzhan Vong into allowing their hulk to descend to Esfandia where she claimed she would turn over the Jedi and the relay base to the Yuuzhan Vong. Veila landed the hulk on the surface of the planet and they took off in speeder bikes to find the relay base.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\nShe met with her father and Droma, who had ventured out in speeder bikes of their own to rig a transponder to explode and also repaired a transmitter so that Veila could transmit a message to the Yuuzhan Vong commander. Solo then helped guard the transponder while the combined scouting party formed an ambush for Yuuzhan Vong who arrived in response to Veila's message. They attacked the Yuuzhan Vong landing party, but Solo's speeder was shot down, her enviro-suit breached. Veila, Fel, and Droma reached her, and Droma took her back to the ''Millennium Falcon'' as she slipped into unconsciousness. She awoke while they were still en route to find that they were being pursued by Yuuzhan Vong ''[[Tsik-Seru]]'' fliers. Solo helped Droma deal with the fliers using thermal detonators to destroy them and her lightsaber to cut away the [[Lav peq|netting beetles]] they hurled at her.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\nAfter sensing that her mother was in trouble at the relay base, Solo and Droma made their way there. Solo helped her subdue a traitor inside the base, eliminating that source of information to the Yuuzhan Vong, while Veila's deception had made the Yuuzhan Vong believe that the transponder was the relay base. Its destruction caused the invaders to withdraw from the surface and they were soundly defeated in orbit, allowing the relay base to re-emerge and continue transmissions.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\n[[File:Jainablue.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jaina near the end of the war]]\nHer injuries sustained on Esfandia prevented her from returning to flying duty, so Solo waited while she recovered. Veila came to see her, apologizing for the trouble she had caused during her state of conflict, and also explained that she had sought Solo's help because Solo reminded her of her lost love, Anakin Solo. Solo told her that she was glad to help.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\n====War's end====\n{{Quote|Nice to see that everyone is so comfortable with deciding my destiny.|Jaina Solo|The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force}}\nUpon her return from the ''Pride of Selonia'' missions, Solo and Twins Suns Squadron rejoined the Galactic Alliance fleet and participated in the [[Battle at Fondor|strike on Fondor]]. The planet and its [[Fondor Shipyards/Legends|shipyards]] were relatively undefended due to a [[Battle of the Duro system|feint]] on [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], allowing the Galactic Alliance to seize the planet. Solo was particularly pleased to see that her squadron emerged from the battle without any casualties. At a celebration afterward, though, a Duros pilot named [[Lensi]] serving in Rogue Squadron attempted to resign, saying that his people had been used and deceived into thinking they were liberating Duro. Solo calmed him down and informed him that the decision had been made to ensure operational security and that it was the right choice in order to accomplish a larger goal, the liberation of Fondor. While Lensi was not exactly thrilled about her perspective, he did rethink his resignation.<ref name=\"The Final Prophecy\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Final Prophecy]]''</ref>\n\nThe next major action she participated in was [[Second Battle of Bilbringi|Operation Trinity]], where she and the Twins Suns again flew under the command of General Antilles. However, when the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] relays in that area were cut off, Antilles' command was left stranded and surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong forces. When a group of Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers sliced through the Galactic Alliance fleet dropping grutchins to attack the capital ships, Solo and her pilots were assigned to fly extremely close to the large warships and burn them off with their thrusters.<ref name=\"The Final Prophecy\" />\n\nOnce that was done, her squadron was personally assigned by General Antilles to examine, recover, and reactivate a derelict [[Golan II Space Defense SpaceGun|Golan II]] battle station. After dealing with some pursuing coralskippers, they approached the station, which was still online. Sending the rest of her squadron ahead to lure away any further pursuit, Solo landed in the station alone. She met with [[Erli Prann]], the commander of the station and found out that it had escaped Yuuzhan Vong notice because it had been equipped with a [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking shield]]. As it turned out, Prann and his crew were scavengers only out to steal equipment and escape the system. They stunned Solo and then brought in the rest of her squadron, disabling their X-wings with ion beams, dragging them into the station with tractor beams, and stunning her pilots so they could steal their hyperdrive motivators, which they needed to escape with their station. Solo was furious and tried to persuade Prann to help her and Antilles, but he was unmoved and ordered her guarded.<ref name=\"The Final Prophecy\" />\n\nWhile Prann was laying in the course to take the Golan Two out of the system, Solo used the Force to fog his mind and alter the trajectory, sending the station right towards a Yuuzhan Vong interdictor that was pinning down the Galactic Alliance fleet. They dropped out of hyperspace in front of it, forcing an enraged Prann to fight for his life. They were able to take down the interdictor, allowing Antilles' beleaguered fleet to escape. Once the interdictor was dealt with, Prann attempted to kill her, though Solo did her best to dissuade him. However, just as Prann was preparing to pull the trigger on his blaster, her parents, who had been acting as couriers to find out what had happened to Antilles, arrived, along with the other pilots of Twin Suns that they had freed. Han Solo was wrathful at Prann for attempting to murder his daughter and pistol-whipped him, warning him that if he ever touched his daughter again, he would be killed. With the station secured and the interdictor down, the remnants of Antilles' fleet jumped out of the Bilbringi system, ending the battle. Afterward, Solo commemorated the fallen and acknowledged the successful retreat along with her parents, General Antilles, and even Imperial Grand Admiral Pellaeon, whose force of Imperial warships had been a reserve for Antilles' fleet but had never gotten the signal to engage.<ref name=\"The Final Prophecy\" />\n\nFollowing these missions, in [[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]], Solo returned to Mon Calamari where she spent what leisure time she had wandering the beaches with Jagged Fel.<ref name=\"The Final Prophecy\" /> However, Solo was not to remain idle in the midst of war. She led a [[Battle of Selvaris|strike]] against a Yuuzhan Vong prisoner convoy over [[Selvaris]]. The Yuuzhan Vong and their Peace Brigade allies took heavy casualties as Solo and her squadron destroyed numerous coralskippers. The majority of the prisoner ships were seized by the Alliance, preventing the Yuuzhan Vong from taking them to Coruscant and sacrificing them. Before the Galactic Alliance transports could escape, though, Yuuzhan Vong reinforcements arrived and Solo helped defend the transports from their attackers, who flew larger, more dangerous [[Slayer ship|versions]] of coralskippers. The enhanced coralskippers, dubbed \"stingcrawlers,\" tore through the Galactic Alliance transports and fighter screen, causing significant damage before the convoy finally escaped.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:JainaRe.jpg|thumb|200px|Jaina Solo in combat]]\nReturning to Mon Calamari, Solo was alarmed to learn that her parents, who had been part of the rescue convoy, had not returned. In response, she took off again in her battered fighter to see where they had gone. She stayed on ''Ralroost'', maintaining a constant vigil for the return of her parents. With the Skywalkers and Jacen still in the Unknown Regions and her parents missing, she grew worried and despondent. Fel and Durron both attempted to lend her emotional support, but she was disconsolate, asking herself questions about how much people meant to her and whether she could handle losing them. Called to a Jedi meeting concerning the missing team in the Unknown Regions, the Jedi decided to wait one more week to see if Master Skywalker responded before assembling a strike team to go after them. Solo agreed that the missing Jedi seemed further away than before, but didn't sense that any of them had died.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nWhen her parents finally returned from a prolonged layover at [[Caluula/Legends|Caluula]], Solo greeted them warmly. She also told them of intelligence that the Yuuzhan Vong were amassing an enormous fleet to take Mon Calamari, staging from [[Toong'L|Toong'l]] and Caluula. Solo participated in reconnaissance runs that detected the Yuuzhan Vong approach, reporting on their fleet's movements until she was ordered back to Mon Calamari.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nShe was present when the Yuuzhan Vong attacked in force and subsequently participated in the [[Defense of Mon Calamari (Yuuzhan Vong War)|defense of Mon Calamari]]. Her squadron was tasked with flying cover for assault [[E-wing escort starfighter|E-wing]] and [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter/Legends|B-wing starfighters]] assaulting Yuuzhan Vong ships along vulnerable fire lanes. Flying through a hail of fire, she managed to survive the maelstrom, pulling back from the massive armada as soon as the order came to withdraw. She and her surviving pilots regrouped, as the Yuuzhan Vong continued to advance. Half of the enemy fleet departed and while the remaining ships pressed forward for some time, they eventually withdrew, heading Coreward. The battle was a victory for the Galactic Alliance, partly due to the death of a yammosk war coordinator on nearby Caluula.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nLater it was discovered that the biological weapon [[Alpha Red]] had killed the yammosk and also destroyed much of Caluula's biosphere, but that was not the reason for the new Warmaster, [[Nas Choka]], to withdraw his fleet. Instead, the Yuuzhan Vong armada had received word that Zonama Sekot, with the Skywalkers and Jacen on it, had entered the Yuuzhan'tar system, formerly the [[Coruscant system/Legends|Coruscant system]] and now the Vong capital. Realizing that Yuuzhan'tar was more important, Choka had ordered the fleet to withdraw from their advance. In response, Kre'fey and Admiral [[Sien Sovv]] consolidated their fleets, including Solo and Twin Suns Squadron, and advanced on Coruscant.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nSolo was reunited with many of her friends and family on Zonama Sekot, as the Yuuzhan Vong were loathe to attack the world. While there, some of the Jedi were bonded with [[seed-partner]]s to form living ships to defend the planet, but Solo was not chosen for that honor. She was disappointed and confused, knowing she was one of the most skilled pilots among the Jedi. As the Galactic Alliance fleet closed on Coruscant, Solo wanted to be with her squadron, but was encouraged to wait a little longer by Mara before leaving. Eventually, she was recommended for a strike team including her parents, Luke Skywalker, and Jacen that would attempt to stop Coruscant's ''[[dhuryam]]'' or World Brain, from destroying the planet on the orders of Supreme Overlord Shimrra. The Supreme Overlord had threatened to lay waste to Coruscant rather than cede it to his enemies, but Jacen had developed a rapport with the ''dhuryam'' during his captivity. As such, the strike team hoped to neutralize Shimrra and rein in the ''dhuryam'' after the penetrated the [[Well of the World Brain]].<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\n[[File:Slayers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaina, Luke and Jacen face Shimrra and his Slayers.]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|Recapture of Coruscant]], Jaina and her brother Jacen Solo, along with Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, flew to the surface of Coruscant in the ''Millennium Falcon'', dodging dovin basals and coralskippers, and began their assault on [[Shimrra's Citadel]]. Galactic Alliance commandos cleared a path into the sacred precinct, allowing the ''Millennium Falcon'' access. Landing near a group of Alliance [[Katarn Commandos|commandos]], they received an update on the status of Yuuzhan Vong forces, who were in retreat thanks to the [[Jeedai heresy|\"Jeedai\"-worshiping]] [[Shamed Ones]], who were eager to overthrow their oppressors. Solo was surprised to see Fel on the ground, assisting there after he had been shot down. She bade him goodbye and then rejoined the team from the ''Millennium Falcon'' and some of the commandos heading for the citadel on foot, fighting through pockets of Yuuzhan Vong resistance. Luke Skywalker at one point dispatched Jade Skywalker, Veila, and Kenth Hamner to assist the Shamed Ones and commandos, while he, Jacen, and Jaina Solo persisted in advancing on the citadel. Jacen was able to use his [[Vongsense|empathy over Yuuzhan Vong creatures]] to allow them to breach into Shimrra's sanctum, while Jade Skywalker's party and the Shamed Ones distracted many of the warriors and gained access to the ''dhuryam''.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nSolo, her brother, and uncle battled their way up through layered defenses of Yuuzhan Vong warriors, but none of their opponents could stand before Luke Skywalker's control of the Force and prowess in combat. They confronted the Supreme Overlord and his elite bodyguards, the [[Slayers]], engaging them in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Seven of the fifteen slayers attacked Solo, perceiving her as the weakest in combat. The fact that Shimrra's bunker had begun shifting due to the manipulations of the ''dhuryam'' which Jacen had successfully co-opted complicated the duel, making it hard for the combatants to stand and fight.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nDuring the assault, Shimrra and his jester [[Onimi]] watched as their elite Slayers fell one by one to the Jedi. While Luke Skywalker dealt with Shimrra, Solo pursued Onimi, who attempted to escape. She followed him into another chamber when he subdued her with the aid of a sedative poison. It was soon revealed that Onimi was the true ruler of the Yuuzhan Vong and had been manipulating Shimrra the entire time. He took Solo captive, thinking she was the Trickster and intending to sacrifice her after he escaped in Shimrra's private escape vessel. However, her brother came to her aid and slew Onimi. As the ship died from exposure to Onimi's array of toxins, Solo's parents, guided by the turncoat Nom Anor, reached the ship and rescued them. Anor attempted to betray them, but was quickly neutralized by Jacen and, by his own request, left there in the crashing ship to die while they used a Yuuzhan Vong [[Yorik-trema]] landing craft to escape. The deaths of Shimrra and Onimi ended the Yuuzhan Vong War. Later, the Galactic Alliance signed a peace treaty with the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nSolo then participated in a [[Conclave on Zonama Sekot|Jedi Conclave]], where Luke Skywalker laid out his vision for the new role of the Jedi in the post-war galaxy. The elder Jedi asked them to search themselves and see where the Force would lead them next. For her part, Solo resolved to keep fighting for \"peace and justice.\" She was also reunited with Fel who on Zonama Sekot, who expressed his love for her and asked her to come with him back to the Chiss homeworld of [[Csilla/Legends|Csilla]], but Solo said she needed some time to settle down before she committed to [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]]. Fel was disappointed, but he also promised to see her more often, as he had been appointed a diplomatic liaison to Coruscant by the Chiss government. Solo then departed Zonama Sekot, attending a ceremony on Kashyyyk to commemorate Anakin and Chewbacca, marked by Han Solo leaving Anakin's lightsaber at a memorial for the Wookiee hero.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" /> Her role in the Yuuzhan Vong War was later noted in a [[Scandoc/Legends|scandoc]] critical of the New Republic and Galactic Alliance's conduct during the war that circulated in [[Confederation]] holofeeds during the Second Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"TEGW\" />\n\n===Dark Nest Crisis (35 ABY&ndash;36 ABY)===\n====A cry for help====\n{{Quote|What's wrong?

Because I'm terrified.|Jaina and her brother|Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen}}\n[[File:JainaDW.png|thumb|right|Jaina as a Jedi Knight]]\nIn the aftermath of the war, Solo continued to serve the Jedi Order, capturing thirty-seven warlords and breaking over one hundred smuggling rings as the Galactic Alliance tried to rebuild itself. [[35 ABY/Legends|Six years]] after the war's conclusion, she, along with Lowbacca and Tesar, subdued the pirate [[Redstar]] and his crew aboard his ship, the ''[[Night Lady]]'', but soon after found herself at [[MaxSec Eight]] answering questions from a [[Reconstruction Authority]] [[Athadar Gyad|inquisitor]]. During the hearing, though, she experienced a sensation of distress in the Force emanating from the Unknown Regions. Following the Force signal, she left her assignment, triangulating her sensation to a region within one hundred light years of Chiss space. Several other Jedi survivors of the mission to Myrkr accompanied her as well, including Tahiri Veila, Alema Rar, Lowbacca, Zekk, Tesar Sebatyne, and Tekli.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nSolo found a nest of [[Killik/Legends|Killiks]], an insectoid species who lived on the edges of known space. They had rescued Raynar Thul and the other two Dark Jedi who had fled from the mission to Myrkr years earlier. Thul, Welk, and Lomi Plo had become integrated into the Killik nests as [[Joiner]]s and it was Thul who had sent the Force signal to summon his friends in order to gain their aid in a border skirmish with the Chiss.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nOperating on a moon of the planet [[Qoribu]], Solo and six other survivors from the Myrkr strike team aided the [[Taat]] nest against Chiss incursions. In the process, their minds, already joined together by the extended use of the Jedi battle meld during the Yuuzhan Vong War, became even more closely bonded to the subtle biochemical effects of the Killik nest. They were soon reinforced by Jacen, who arrived not long afterward. Jacen had been sent the coordinates of the Killik nests by his sister, but en route, he also stopped to investigate the wreckage of the ''Tachyon Flier'', the ship that had conveyed Thul and the Dark Jedi to the Unknown Regions. Using a combination of StealthXs, Jacen's ChaseX, and Tahiri's Sekotan ship, they worked with Killik [[dartship]]s to disable Chiss [[Defoliator/Legends|defoliators]] that were attempting to deny the Killiks food and natural resources that they were trying to harvest.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nOn one mission, though, while battling through a group of clawcraft in an attempt to disable four more defoliators, the Chiss sent in reinforcements: a cloaked [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class Star Destroyer]]. The warship was able to damage and capture Lowbacca and Chiss starfighters soon surrounded the Killik dartships and Jedi. At that point, Alema Rar decided to do what the Jedi had previously avoided and use lethal force. The battle erupted into a full-scale fight and Solo, though furious, saw that even with the loss of several Chiss starfighters, four more Jedi craft had been caught in the Star Destroyer's tractor beams. At that point, another Killik nest, the [[Mueum]], sent thousands of its primitive rocket-powered dartships to smash into the Star Destroyer. Though Lowbacca was forced to eject, the Jedi had escaped casualties for the moment, but at the cost of Chiss lives and the escalation of hostilities.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nUnbeknownst to her and the others, her parents as well as the Masters Skywalker and Saba Sebatyne had journeyed to the Unknown Regions to meet Raynar Thul, who now styled himself \"UnuThul\" as his fully integrated identity into the Killik nest. Having learned of the seven Jedi's location via a [[Flow-walking|Force message]] that Jacen had left at the wreckage of the ''Tachyon Flier'', the elder Solos, Saba, and the Skywalkers arrived at Qoribu shortly after the battle. After fending off a small swarm of dartships belonging to [[Gorog]], the Dark Nest controlled by the Dark Jedi Lomi Plo and Welk, the visitors landed and met with the seven renegade Jedi.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nAfter greetings were exchanged, the Masters Skywalker insisted on explanations of Solo's and the others' conduct. Though Solo would have preferred to be rescuing Lowbacca, Luke Skywalker was insistent. Solo and the other Jedi who had journeyed to Qoribu showed them around the nest, pointing out various aspects of Killik life. However, when asked about the Killiks that had attacked the Solos and Skywalkers en route to Qoribu, all seven of the Joiner Jedi denied any knowledge of the attackers and stated that it was impossible for such an attack to have occurred. At that point, Master Skywalker asked for all seven of them to return to Coruscant. Solo and the others were indignant, but when she asked her mother for her opinion, Leia replied that the seven Jedi were making matters worse. Solo agreed to leave at that point, but only after Lowbacca was rescued. Her parents and Saba Sebatyne did help search for Lowbacca even in the midst of a Chiss search cordon, but the Chiss were able to recover the Wookiee Jedi before the elder Solos could, much to Solo's annoyance.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nWhile the Masters Skywalker had departed with four of the strike team members, Solo, Zekk, and Rar remained, refusing to return to Coruscant until Lowbacca was recovered, despite entreaties by Solo's parents. Instead, the three young Jedi decided to stay on Qoribu and delay the Chiss, while also promising to look into the mysterious Killiks that had repeatedly attacked the elder Solos' and Skywalkers' party, to the point where a lightsaber-wielding assailant and several vicious Killiks had dueled Saba Sebatyne and injured her badly. Realizing that their daughter was unmoved, Han and Leia Solo departed, conveying the injured Sebatyne and Rar, who volunteered to accompany them as a guide, with them.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nSolo and Zekk continued to become more immersed in the Killik hive-mind. One night, they fell asleep next to each other after participating in a communal Killik dance, though when she awoke, Solo insisted that nothing had happened between them and Zekk agreed. Not long after, they were met by Thul, who told them that they were being sent back to the Galactic Alliance. Solo quickly perceived that Thul was planning to destroy the next Chiss fleet sent against the Qoribu nests, which would buy time for a Hapan fleet that Jacen had convinced to aid the Killiks to arrive. When they asked him about his motivation for war and about the Dark Jedi and vicious Killiks that belonged to a secretive Dark Nest, Thul grew defensive and evasive. The conversation ended shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\n[[File:Japanese_joinerking-Jaina_Solo.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Jaina during the Dark Nest Crisis]]\nAs Thul continued his preparations for war, Solo's mind was touched by that of her twin brother's, who reminded her of what Lomi Plo and Welk had done to them on Myrkr. Gathering her mind and thoughts so she regained almost full control over her individuality, she persuaded Zekk to accompany her to the hangar and stop the war that Thul was planning. Their progress was impeded by streams of Killiks all headed the other way, while Thul's will damped down on her concentration and focus. Seeing the difficulty they were having, Solo pretended to give up and returned to the barracks while encouraging Zekk to keep trying to reach the hangar. She then collected her thoughts and focused on Jagged Fel, whom her parents had previously learned was with the nearest Chiss task force. She concentrated on the Force and sent him a message, a taunt that tipped him off to the impending Killik attack.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nDespite their efforts, the arrival of a Jedi strike team and the elder Solos bent on eliminating the Dark Nest, which had headquartered itself inside a moon called [[Kr]], was enough to bring both the Hapan and Chiss fleets into trading blows in a show of brinkmanship. The Killik ambush had been ruined by Solo's warning of Fel, and yet Thul drove the swarm of Killik dartships to attack, in order to rescue Lowbacca. For her part, Solo and Zekk were in their StealthXs waiting for an opportunity to free their Wookiee friend. While they were maneuvering into position, Solo sensed her mother battling the Dark Nest on Kr and also recognized that a seeming retreat by the Chiss was actually a deceptive [[Bothan fade]] tactic. She warned Thul of the threat and then she and Zekk sneaked into the heart of the Chiss fleet in a brazen attempt to infiltrate it and rescue Lowbacca. They were discovered and flew through a barrage of defensive fire, which caused the Chiss to send the warship containing Lowbacca into the safety of hyperspace.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nDissuaded and defeated, they turned their StealthXs back to Kr to assist their parents. Though surprised to see the Dark Nest's existence confirmed, they entered the tunnels where the Jedi strike team had landed and helped fend off Killiks that were attacking the grounded ships. They were fully Joined to the Nests by that point and so did not participate in the fight against Gorog and the duel where Luke Skywalker slew Welk. Instead, they waited for Thul to arrive. Thul's emotionally damaged psyche could not comprehend the nature of the Dark Nest, but he did accept Han and Leia Solo's offer of conveying the Killik nests to new worlds farther from Chiss space. This came at one condition, though; Thul insisted that Solo and Zekk were no longer welcome in the Killik nests. The Chiss and Hapans agreed to a truce and the Chiss even released Lowbacca. Solo took the opportunity to bid Fel goodbye and they both expressed mutual sentiments of gratitude that neither had had to directly fight the other.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" />\n\nLess than a year later, Solo and Zekk returned to active duty as Jedi Knights and were assigned to investigate reports of stolen [[Tibanna/Legends|Tibanna]] gas on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. The planet had become increasingly prone to attacks by tibanna tappers, who sought to use the gases for their own purposes. Upon their arrival, Solo and Zekk intercepted a trio of tappers using [[siphoning balloon]]s to siphon Tibanna gas at a refinery and engaged them in a dogfight above [[BesGas Three]], trying to use their ion beams to shut down the craft. However, during the fight, the tappers made a hasty escape into the [[Change Zone]]. Solo and Zekk continued the pursuit, bypassing the dangerous storms in the Change Zone, and finally caught up with the thieves at an ancient refinery in the [[Dead Eye]].<ref name=\"Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\">''[[Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen]]''</ref>\n\nLanding on the refinery, they found [[Color/Legends|black]] [[membrosia]], a Killik food substance made by the Dark Nest. Its existence was proof that the Dark Nest had survived. However, while they were searching the refinery, the Tibanna tappers departed and left, while shutting down the repulsorlifts that powered the station. Solo and Zekk quickly departed before the refinery crashed, though both were annoyed at their failure to capture the Tibanna tappers.<ref name=\"Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\" />\n\nAfter they learned the Dark Nest had again arisen and had attempted to attack Luke Skywalker, Solo and Zekk sought to defend the Killik Colony from blame, but the fact that the Killiks were influencing pirates and subverting insect species with black membrosia meant that their repudiations fell on deaf ears. In particular, despite their renewed service to the Jedi Order, some of the Masters remained suspicious of them, as Solo and Zekk were still Joined to each other and retained an emotional attachment to the Killiks. They were expressly forbidden from attempting to aid in a search for the location of the Dark Nest. The Jedi also learned that the new planets, including [[Woteba]], that the Killiks had been re-settled on, were defended by a [[Fizz (acid)|form of nanotechnology]] that attacked anything not native to the planet that was in sufficient quantities.<ref name=\"Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\" />\n\n====Swarm War====\n{{Quote|Don't apologize. The fault is all mine. I should never have made the mistake of thinking Jedi had honor.''\"<br />\"''Jagged, we&mdash;I&mdash;want you to know that I still love you. And I always will. But if you can eject, you should do it now.|Jagged Fel and Jaina Solo|Dark Nest III: The Swarm War}}\nSuspicious and resentful of the outsiders, the Killiks imprisoned Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, blaming them for the defenses of Woteba, and the Galactic Alliance implemented a blockade of the [[Utegetu Nebula/Legends|Utegetu Nebula]] where the Killiks lived. Kyp Durron tried to put together a rescue team that included Solo and Zekk. However, the action was not approved by all the Masters, including acting leader Corran Horn. Horn, Hamner, and several other Jedi arrived in the hangar where the would-be rescue team was assembled and a prolonged argument over the proper course of action ensued.<ref name=\"Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\" />\n\n[[File:First_Battle_of_Qoribu.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Jaina commanding troops on Tenupe]]\nDuring the argument, Jacen arrived and, convinced by a Force vision he had experienced earlier that showed the Chiss and Killiks leading the galaxy back into war, convinced Solo and four other members of the Myrkr mission survivors into taking StealthXs and heading out to prevent the war. They were tricked by Jacen into attacking a [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] [[Supply Depot Thrago|base]] to cause a war between the Chiss and the Killiks, as Jacen claimed that the Chiss were preparing to launch a surprise attack on the Killiks that would ignite a war. His logic was that instigating a conflict before the Chiss could commence hostilities would diminish the overall effect of the war. He was actually using them for his own purposes and the Chiss were planning no such strike. The mission went successfully, with the StealthXs destroying the base's fuel supply and launching [[glop bomb]]s to damage the Chiss base without casualties. Solo was furious at the deception, and vowed that she would never fly with Jacen again. The [[Swarm War]] had begun.<ref name=\"Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\" />\n\nWhen Luke Skywalker called all the Jedi to the [[Conclave on Ossus]], Solo and Zekk ignored the call, and along with the other Joiner Jedi remained in the Unknown Regions to help the Killiks win the war that had arisen against the Chiss on Tenupe, using their StealthXs to good effect. The Chiss invaded Tenupe, landing thousands of troops on the planet's surface. After an unexploded Chiss bomb landed near the [[Iesei]] nest, Solo and Zekk attempted to investigate. The Chiss countered by sending in a demolition team in a dropship to destroy the weapon before the Killiks could dismantle it. Solo and the team of Jedi battled the dropship and the group of Chiss commandos it disgorged. Solo was also surprised to see Jagged Fel on the dropship and was momentarily distracted by seeing him again. This nearly proved fatal as a laser cannon blast almost hit her, but Zekk knocked her aside in time. Jacen then dealt with the dropship by causing it to crash, though Fel survived thanks to Jacen's careful use of the Force that disabled the craft without destroying it. While the Jedi fought the commandos, Fel emerged from the ship and activated the [[vape charge]]s, destroying the bomb. Solo was displeased with Jacen's actions, regardless of the fact that he had saved Fel's life, though. After this skirmish, Solo and Zekk stiffened their resolve to stay with the Killiks, even though Jacen and the others did answer Skywalker's mental call and journeyed to Ossus.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\">''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]''</ref>\n\nThe Chiss soon landed on Tenupe in force, while Solo and Zekk waited with a massive force of Killiks placed under their command by Thul. The Killiks counterattacked by digging tunnels underneath the Chiss drop ships and ambushing the ships when the tunnels collapsed. During the battle, Jaina Solo led the ground forces of the [[Jooj]] and [[Rekker]] nests, supported by airborne squadrons of [[Qeeq]] and [[Aebea]], led by [[Zekk]], in a fierce battle in the wilds of Tenupe. In the melee, Solo dealt with three Chiss soldiers waiting in ambush, crippling two of them and killing the third. She attempted to save the lives of the two injured, but they were convinced that survival was the same as being insect food and activated a vape charge. Solo jumped free in time and returned to the battle.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" />\n\nOver the next weeks, Solo participated as wave after wave of Killiks attempted to wage a [[Battle of Tenupe|war of attrition]] on the Chiss landing force, at a terrible cost in Killik lives. Compelled by the will of Thul, the insects would sacrifice themselves in storming Chiss positions even as the invaders conducted a strategic withdrawal that whittled away at the enormous numbers of Killiks. The insects continued to push forward, though, overwhelming Chiss [[MetaCannon]] artillery and infantry alike with sheer weight of Killik numbers. When a squadron of Chiss [[AirStraeker]] gunships arrived, Solo called for Zekk and his airborne units to assist her, but Chiss clawcraft held him off even while giant [[Kolosolok]] Killiks made their attack on the Chiss perimeter. When Zekk did arrive, the AirStraekers were quickly dealt with and Solo pressed the assault. Using a telekinetically-hurled vape charge, Solo was able to disable the Chiss perimeter shield, allowing the Killiks to flood in and overwhelm a Chiss base.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" />\n\nThe Chiss were able to halt the Killik advance after retreating behind their shield generators and launching insecticide into the Killik lines. However, the Chiss were forced to withdraw once again after their shields were breached by the huge Kolosolok. The ground battle became a stalemate as the massive casualties sustained by the Killiks began to take their toll.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" />\n\nWith the Chiss force pushed back to a small group of islands, Solo found herself confronting an entrenched enemy with superiority in firepower. Deciding to take a more cautious approach, she attempted to do some scouting on her own, only to be attacked by a pair of [[Squib/Legends|Squibs]] that had been hired to kill her. She deflected their assault and retreated, her position compromised to Chiss snipers. With the help of the [[Mollom]] nest, she captured her assailants and interrogated them, learning that a hit on her life had been placed by the Squib [[Director/Legends|Directors]]. She ordered them to abandon their plan, threatening their lives if they attempted to kill her again, and then turned them loose so she could focus on dealing with the Chiss. Upon seeing the Killiks use their primitive trebuchet artillery, she came up with the idea to flood the islands they were holding.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" />\n\nWeeks later, Solo soon returned to the skies in her StealthX for the final planned Killik assault on the Chiss, who had been flooded out by a bombardment of boulders damming up the river and increasing the water level. Upon seeing a massive Chiss fleet descend into the atmosphere, Solo was surprised by their appearance, and even more surprised to receive a mental warning from her mother, who was in-system to look for her. Solo was unperturbed, though, knowing that Thul was readying a Killik swarm to attack the Chiss and smash them into Tenupe. At that point, she saw a heavily guarded group of defoliators and sensed danger on those ships. She attempted to attack them, but the Chiss guards were vigilant and willing to sacrifice themselves against her torpedoes. Solo and Zekk found themselves in combat against Fel, though Solo warned him that while she still loved him, he should eject to avoid her having to kill him. However, Fel and Chiss continued to protect the defoliators. At that point, Alema Rar arrived in a StealthX to assist Solo and Zekk, knocking down some of the defoliators while they provided a diversion. Rar then vanished, but Leia, Sebatyne, and Han Solo arrived in the ''Millennium Falcon'' after having escaped Chiss custody to assist Solo and Zekk. As it turned out, the defoliators were carrying lethal parasite bombs that would destroy all of the Killiks, and the elder Solos did not want to see the insect species wiped out. However, despite their skills, Solo and Zekk were forced to land their crippled StealthXs in the hostile jungles of Tenupe and hide.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" />\n\nThey were rescued by the ''Millennium Falcon'' from the shelter they were holed up in. Both of them were sent to recover in the infirmary, and were quite worried about Jagged Fel's fate. During their time on Tenupe their exposure to other nests caused their Joiner bond to the Taat nest, and each other to deteriorate, eventually leaving them almost completely un-Joined by the time of their departure from Tenupe.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" /> Their familiarity with each other because of their time as Joiners meant they retained a strong Force connection to each other.<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref> Due to this connection they remained close as of [[40 ABY]]. Both went to great lengths to explain to family and friends that they were just friends and partners, but Solo's family saw something more than a simple friendship.<ref name=\"Betrayal\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]''</ref>\n\n===Second Galactic Civil War (40 ABY&ndash;41 ABY)===\n====Rising tensions====\n{{Quote|Traitor?

And as Jedi, we're supposed to put the interest of the greater good above planetary concerns.|Jaina Solo|Legacy of the Force: Betrayal}}\n[[File:Betrayal.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaina and her family in a tense political argument]]\nIn [[40 ABY]], tensions flared between the Galactic Alliance and Corellia, and threatened to divide her family. Out of duty, Jacen and Jaina Solo, and Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker sided with the Galactic Alliance, while the elder Solos adopted the viewpoint of the Corellians.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /><ref name=\"Bloodlines\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines]]''</ref> With the discovery of an illegal missile factory on [[Adumar/Legends|Adumar]], the Galactic Alliance conducted [[Operation Roundabout|a punitive military strike]] at Corellia. Solo participated in the operation as the leader of Team Purella&ndash;consisting of fellow Jedi Zekk, [[Kolir Hu'lya]], and [[Thann Mithric]]&ndash;which was tasked with kidnapping Prime Minister [[Aidel Saxan]] from her residence in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]]. While trailing Aidel Saxan's convoy in traffic, Solo, Hu'lya, and Mithric fell into a trap and were ambushed by CorSec YVH droids. Zekk managed to land atop of the Prime Minister's convoy, but instead of finding Saxan, he encountered a decoy droid and was forced to flee as the droid self-destructed. Solo rushed to Zekk's aid, reaching him just in time to slow down his descent with the Force. She was joined soon after by Hu'lya and Mithric, and together they managed to destroy the remainder of the droids. With Zekk in tow, the group fled the scene and made their way to [[Behareh Spaceport]], where they met up with another team led by Veila. The mission was dubbed a failure, as both teams failed to catch their quarry, and with Corellians alerted to their presence, they were forced to leave behind [[Tiu Zax]] and make a silent retreat. The overall operation, however, was a partial success as Jacen and Ben Skywalker managed to cripple [[Centerpoint Station]], buying the Alliance enough time for a counterattack.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nWhen the Galactic Alliance decided to have peace talks with Corellia in the [[Kuat system/Legends|Kuat system]], Solo and Zekk accompanied Solo's family to Toryaz Station. On the first evening of the negotiations, the station came under attack by a group of drugged Corellian commandos hired by Solo's cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo and the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lady of the Sith]] [[Lumiya]] to eliminate Aidel Saxan and Gilad Pellaeon. Pellaeon survived but Saxan was killed during the course of the attack. Solo and Zekk were then assigned to investigate [[Siron Tawaler]], a security officer who had gone missing some time before the attack. They caught up with Wedge Antilles and Tycho Celchu outside of the airlock Tawaler was last seen in, and traded leads before examining the area. There, Wedge discovered a tassel and as promised, he handed the cloth over to Solo.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nLeaving Jacen to investigate the tassel, Solo and Zekk returned to the task force on Corellia, and took command of Skywalker's [[Hardpoint Squadron]]. After running training drills with the pilots, Solo moved the squadron and their fighters to the outpost orbiting Tralus, where they anxiously waited to be called into the battle that was beginning to take place over the planet. For the most part, Solo and the other Jedi remained docked at the [[Rellidir]] beachhead while [[VibroSword Squadron]] attempted to protect Tralus' shield generators from being destroyed. Though they failed to prevent the shield's destruction,<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> the Alliance blockaded Corellia in response.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\n====Schism between siblings====\n{{Quote|I don't know him anymore. There's something dark about him now.|Jaina, feeling the dark side in Jacen|Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines}}\nAs the war raged, Solo rejoined the Galactic Alliance Defense Force in order to crush insurgents under the leadership of Corellia. However, Solo didn't approve of Jacen's instant promotion to colonel, which strained their relationship even more. Still holding her rank of Lieutenant Colonel, Solo and her brother led Rogue Squadron into battle, but she questioned her brother's methods. During the [[Blockade of Corellia]], Jacen ordered his sister to fire on a civilian ship, but she refused. As a result, she was stripped of her rank and suspended. Solo began noticing Jacen's dark behavior and was the first to suggest that Ben Skywalker should be given a new master other than Jacen. She also admitted Jacen was now a stranger to her in a conversation with her uncle Luke Skywalker. Solo questioned her twin brother's moral judgment, and felt that Jacen would hurt her deeply in the future.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\n[[File:JainaTahiri.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Jaina Solo]]\nShortly afterward, Solo and Zekk were ordered to observe a supposedly secret Corellian fleet that was amassing. They were alerted out of Force-hibernation when Solo's astromech caught the ''Falcon'' leaving the area and followed it until it jumped, discovering that her parents were setting their course for Hapes. Solo returned from their mission to report to Admiral [[Nek Bwua'tu]], but didn't reveal the identity of the ship. Bwua'tu mentioned to Solo that Jacen had started assassinating Bothans because he suspected and blamed them for poisoning the World Brain. Calling her bluff for not revealing the ship to be the ''Falcon'', Nek ordered Jaina Solo to collect Zekk and go to Hapes to warn Tenel Ka of the possibility of Corellia moving to aid in deposing her.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nAfter retrieving Zekk from the [[Kiris Asteroid Cluster]], Solo and Zekk traveled to Hapes, where Tenel Ka and Isolder told them of her parents' involvement in an assassination attempt. Distraught at this revelation, Solo was forced to choose between her family and her duty to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Choosing the latter, Solo and Zekk undertook a mission from Tenel Ka to deliver her fleet's mobilization orders to Lady [[Galney (Lady)|Galney's]] sister on [[Terephon]]. However, the two were attacked by [[Miy'til starfighter]]s owned by the Ducha, which destroyed their X-wings and stranded the two. After escaping the Miy'tils, Solo and Zekk were rescued by Ben Skywalker in his skiff. Upon arriving near Hapes with valuable intelligence, Solo, Zekk, Ben and another crewman fled in the escape pods as the skiff came under attack by insurrection forces. Rescued by the ''Millennium Falcon'', Solo and the others boarded the ship under heavy fire from Jacen's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']], by order of Jacen. While Solo was helping her father with repairs, Ben unexpectedly tried to arrest Han, even going as far pulling his lightsaber on the elder Solo. For her part, Solo had no intentions of instigating action toward her parents, knowing that they would not attempt to harm Tenel Ka intentionally. Seeing Ben's actions, Zekk tackled him from behind and managed to grab a hold of him. While trying to do so, Zekk was accidentally slashed in the abdomen by Ben's lightsaber. Shortly afterward, Han asked Solo to leave the ''Falcon'' with Ben and the severely injured Zekk, saying his goodbyes to his family before they jettisoned in the Falcon's escape pods. Later on, they were rescued by Hapan vessels and reunited with the others on Hapes.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nAfter returning to the [[new Jedi Temple]] on Coruscant, Solo unexpectedly ran into Jagged Fel. After a tense reunion, Solo was teamed with Fel and Zekk by Luke Skywalker to track down the deranged Dark Jedi Alema Rar, who had also survived the Swarm War. This partnership was led by Fel, with Solo's reluctant agreement. Solo found herself increasingly irritated by the increasing friction between Fel and Zekk over each other's supposed interest in her. Meeting up with her parents and several close friends on the ''[[Errant Venture]]'', the three helped spring a trap on Rar, who was trying to kill her parents. Despite being shot by Fel, the Twi'lek managed to escape.<ref name=\"Exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\n====Hunting Alema Rar====\n{{Quote|If I'm supposed to be the Sword of the Jedi, it's time I took it seriously.|Jaina to Luke after Mara's death|Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice}}\nSolo would later admit to using her conflicting emotions for Zekk and Fel to block her emotions and thoughts of Jacen. She thought that the family, and not just Mara Jade Skywalker, should pursue Lumiya. Solo hunted Lumiya with Jade Skywalker, but later left after Jade Skywalker said she wanted to handle Lumiya alone and told Solo to continue tracking Rar. After feeling Mara's death through the Force, Jaina was the first to rush to her uncle's aid. When Luke asked her if she wanted Zekk or Fel to be with her, Solo replied that she was done with them and that the Sword of the Jedi was needed.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:JainaWar.jpg|thumb|left|Jaina Solo brandishes her lightsaber.]]\nSolo did not attend the [[Funeral of Mara Jade Skywalker]], as she was with Zekk and Fel hunting Alema Rar, who had acquired a Sith [[Sith Meditation Sphere|meditation sphere]] from Lumiya. Solo repeatedly informed both men that she was not interested in them, desiring to dedicate herself to pursuing Rar, who was a suspect in the death of Mara Jade Skywalker. They pursued Rar to the Jedi academy on Ossus, where Solo found that there were larger issues to deal with, thanks to Jacen. Zekk remained hidden with their ship while Solo and Fel went into the academy to investigate and inform Kam and Tionne Solusar. However, while most of the senior Jedi Masters and Knights were at the funeral, Jacen who had by now chosen the Sith name Darth Caedus had sent a [[Galactic Alliance Guard]] battalion to secure the academy and effectively hold it hostage.<ref name=\"Inferno\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref>\n\nUpon arriving, Solo found an emotionally unbalanced Major [[Salle Serpa|Serpa]] in charge of the GAG contingent, who had her and Fel disarmed. Solo would have preferred to engage them, but she knew that the young Jedi trainees' lives were at stake, so she complied. Not long after and light years away, Luke Skywalker openly broke with Caedus, abandoning the Galactic Alliance. In response, Caedus ordered the Jedi at the academy [[Battle of Ossus (Second Galactic Civil War)|slain]]. The GAG attempted to coma gas Solo before they killed her, but she awoke, cleared the gas from her body, and warned the others. While Tionne and Kam attempted to confront Major Serpa unarmed, Solo and Fel picked off the sniper teams, though not before the snipers nearly killed Kam Solusar and Serpa mutilated Tionne. Solo stormed down to save the young trainees, who had been herded into one area by the GAG. As young Jedi-to-be erupted in rebellion, Solo confronted Serpa, who had taken a trainee hostage to stop her from killing him. However, at that time, Zekk arrived from his concealment and sliced Serpa's arm off. Meanwhile, the Jedi subdued the GAG, though at a heavy cost in young lives.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nSolo then met up with her uncle Luke Skywalker on Kashyyyk, where he and her parents had been convincing the Wookiees to resist Caedus, who arrived shortly thereafter in the ''Anakin Solo''. When Caedus, whom Solo no longer recognized as family, started bombarding Kashyyyk, Solo and Skywalker were part of a StealthX strike against the Fifth Fleet. As Skywalker made a solo run on the ''Anakin Solo'' with shadow bombs in hopes of killing Jacen, Solo flew cover for him. However, Caedus also entered the fray in a StealthX, attempting to thwart his uncle while maneuvering such that any of Solo's shots that missed Caedus would impact on Skywalker's vehicle. On the last of these passes, Solo's lasers hit the rear fuselage of Skywalker's StealthX, blasting it apart. Horrified, she returned to Kashyyyk with the knowledge that she had killed her uncle.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\nHowever, Skywalker had faked his death to disable the ''Anakin Solo'' and rescue his son from Caedus, who had taken Ben prisoner onboard the Star Destroyer. As he returned with Ben, Confederation and Hapan fleets pounded the Fifth Fleet until it withdrew, and Solo followed her uncle and the rest of the Jedi in refusing to take sides in the conflict. However, she and Leia both promised Skywalker that they would beat him severely if he ever scared them by faking his death again.<ref name=\"Inferno\" />\n\n====Forging the Sword====\n{{Quote|I'm trying to find a way to tell her that if you sharpen a sword all the time, even when it's not dull, by the time you need it there's no metal left. It will break. But she's not listening.|Jagged Fel, to Han and Leia Solo, about Jaina Solo being too focused on the future fight with her brother|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nFollowing Caedus's bombardment of Kashyyyk, Solo, Fel, and Zekk assisted Solo's parents in fighting the forest fires that had been ignited. During these efforts, Solo and the others encountered an attack by a seemingly whole Rar. They defeated Rar, but could later find no trace of her presence. They would later deduce that the attacker had been merely a [[Force phantom]] controlled by Rar.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nJaina Solo became obsessed with training as the Sword of the Jedi while on Kashyyyk, but Jagged Fel made her see otherwise when he told her that she was an excellent Sword, but was becoming a terrible Jedi. Fel defeated Solo in a sparring session using the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Crushgaunt/Legends|crushgaunts]] and [[Mandalorian iron|''beskar'']] armor plates [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] had sent to Han Solo, angering the younger Solo. Upset, she used the Force to hurl Fel into a tree. If not for the armor he was wearing, he would have been killed, which startled her out of her anger. Fel also said that Solo had been preparing as if she were going to fight someone who fought like a Jedi. He said that Rar or Caedus would not do this. Therefore, he demonstrated how an opponent would use trickery to defeat her. Though she still was not pleased, Solo did see his reasoning.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nHer next major mission after finishing her training on Kashyyyk was to journey with her parents on the yacht ''[[Love Commander]]'' while trying to plant a tracker on the ''Anakin Solo'' and launch a data raid on Caedus's shuttle. Solo and her father, along with Zekk and Fel, infiltrated the vessel while Leia attempted to negotiate with her son. [[Battle of the rendezvous point|Battling]] through the security on the Star Destroyer, the four were able to get through to Caedus's shuttle while placing their tracing device. Their mission completed, the saboteurs waited for Leia to return. By then, the ''Anakin Solo'' was in the middle of a pitched battle. Waiting until Luke Skywalker and the other Jedi had successfully distracted Caedus, the five infiltrators left.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nAlong with Zekk, her parents, and Fel, Solo returned to the hunt for the rogue Jedi Alema Rar. With Talon Karrde's organization having sent them the location of the asteroid where Rar was likely hiding, Solo, her parents, Fel, and Zekk headed out to confront the deranged Dark Jedi. Fel, Zekk, and Solo landed their craft on the asteroid and began their hunting, fighting through phantom mynocks that sometimes resembled the intruders. Solo became separated first from Fel when he went on a chase to distract their pursuit, and then from Zekk when the other Jedi attempted to deal with Rar's [[Sith Meditation Sphere]]. Confronting Rar, Solo pursued the Twi'lek and [[Skirmish at The Home|engaged]] her, but the planting of explosives on the asteroid by a group of mercenaries caused the depressurization of the atmosphere. Fel caught back up with her at this point, as the phantom mynocks had disappeared when Zekk had chased off the meditation sphere. Knowing that he could survive longer in vacuum than she could thanks to his customized suit, Fel told her to get clear while he dealt with Rar. Solo reluctantly complied and helped Zekk back to their fighters and the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nAfter linking back up with Fel, who had killed Rar and narrowly escaped the destruction of the asteroid, Solo and the others returned to the secret Jedi base on Endor. Solo then participated in the recovery mission to retrieve Tenel Ka and Jacen's daughter [[Allana Solo|Allana]] from the control of Darth Caedus. Flying in [[Rakehell Squadron]] as Rakehell Nine (her old designation from Twin Suns Squadron), Solo flew with the others and created the deception that allowed the shuttle ''[[Reveille]]'' to land inside the ''Anakin Solo'' and deposit a boarding team of Luke and Ben Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo, Han Solo, and Saba Sebatyne inside the Star Destroyer to rescue Allana. Once again, the Corellian system was [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Second Galactic Civil War)|ablaze with war]] as the Rakehells stayed near Centerpoint Station after escorting their second shuttle, this time bearing Kyp Durron and Doctor [[Toval Seyah]], into the station to disable it. For a time, the Rakehells were engaged by Galactic Alliance starfighters, including Rogue Squadron, and were forced to kill the other pilots in self-defense, despite having no great desire to do so. However, they gained a reprieve as Confederate forces also moved in to engage the Galactic Alliance task force. After the intrusion team aboard the ''Anakin Solo'' retrieved Allana and was extracted by Fel and [[Kyle Katarn]] aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', Solo and the other Rakehells flew cover for the ''Falcon'' as they escaped the battle and jumped into hyperspace, to be later rejoined by Durron and Seyah. The end result of the concurrent battle was the destruction of Centerpoint Station thanks to Durron's and Seyah's sabotage, but the Confederation fleet had also inflicted significant losses on the task force that had accompanied the ''Anakin Solo.''<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n====Training under Boba Fett====\n{{Quote|Fett, you can teach me to bring down Jedi. You've done it often enough.|Jaina imploring Boba Fett to train her|Legacy of the Force: Revelation}}\n[[File:JainaCard-2.jpg|thumb|right|Jaina Solo]]\nInspired by the \"gift\" Boba Fett had sent to her father and something that Fel had said, Solo set out to find Fett, hoping to enlist his aid in hunting Caedus and to learn from him skills she would need to confront her twin. Before she left, she was present with Leia when her cousin Ben Skywalker confessed to investigating Caedus's role in Mara Jade Skywalker's death. Arriving on [[Mandalore/Legends|Mandalore]] in an X-wing, Solo found herself confronted by a group of heavily armed Mandalorians, and she was escorted to meet Boba Fett in a humble, rustic cantina that served as the [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore's]] seat of government, all too aware of the traditional Mandalorian dislike for Jedi. Fett agreed to train her, but promised to be a hard teacher. While in the cantina, she encountered a pair of Force-sensitive Mandalorians, [[Bardan Jusik|Gotab]] and [[Venku Skirata|Venku]], but had little chance to talk with them.<ref name=\"Revelation\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nIn her first lesson, Fett started by dueling her with a lightsaber, only to eventually relax and discuss Caedus's strengths as other Mandalorians gathered to watch. Her guard lowered, Fett delivered a tremendous punch to her midsection, catching her completely by surprise and humiliating her. It was not to be her only defeat at the hands of the warrior people. There was significant tension between Solo and Fett, but she put up with it in her quest to find a way to defeat Caedus. Another Mandalorian, [[Goran Beviin]], also managed some of her training, and defeated her in combat with Mandalorian iron [[Beskad/Legends|beskad]] sabers. Beviin taught her the importance of being able to wage a total war, an all-or-nothing combat against one's opponent. However, Beviin also allowed her to stay at his farm, and there Solo met [[Mirta Gev]], Fett's granddaughter, who eventually came to regard her as a comrade in arms. Solo realized that the harsh savagery of the Mandalorians contrasted with the familial bonds they seemed to share.<ref name=\"Revelation\" />\n\nEven as she trained under Fett, she was required to help with mechanical work and other fairly menial tasks around the Mandalorian settlement, and in doing so, learned about the Mandalorian culture and Fett's personal history. Fett himself told her that he particularly reserved Caedus for her to deal with, because it was the fault of the Skywalker and Solo families that the Sith had been allowed to wreak such havoc. In addition to her standard training, Solo accompanied Fett and other Mandalorians to Fondor, hired out as a contract force to accompany Admiral [[Natasi Daala]]'s ragtag [[Maw Irregular Fleet]]. After Gilad Pellaeon was murdered by Caedus's new Sith apprentice, Tahiri Veila, on his flagship, the [[Bloodfin (Star Destroyer)|''Bloodfin'']], Solo and the Mandalorians boarded the ship, with Solo expecting Caedus to rescue his new apprentice. The Mandalorians stormed ''Bloodfin'', killing any Imperials who dared to resist them and also dealing with the renegade Moffs who had planned on seizing power after Pellaeon's death and had been aiding Caedus. Solo and Gev set out after Veila and chased her down the escape shafts. Gev charged Veila and engaged her in melee combat, using a vibroblade to slice Veila's femoral artery while Solo held off other Imperials. However, Caedus arrived and began [[Telekinesis/Legends#Choking powers|Force-choking]] Gev until Solo broke his grip, which allowed the Sith and his apprentice to make their escape. While the Sith Lord suffered further injury from a group of Mandalorians, he and Veila were able to escape to regroup and consolidate on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Revelation\" />\n\nFollowing the battle, Solo returned to Mandalore to continue her training. She also was brought into the secret that Fett's wife, [[Sintas Vel]], long believed dead, was actually alive and had recently been unfrozen from [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]]. Solo visited Vel and suggested that a [[Jedi healer/Legends|Jedi healer]] might be able to heal some of the mental damage that Vel had sustained while in hibernation. She sensed that one of the Force-sensitive Mandalorians, Gotab, had skill in the healing arts, and recruited him to apply Force-induced therapy on Vel. Solo took part in the two-hour process, lending her considerable Force strength to Gotab, and Vel began making a much more complete recovery. During this time, Solo also received Ben Skywalker's presentation of evidence that Jacen Solo had killed Mara Jade Skywalker, via holocomm, which only stiffened her resolve to learn how to deal with Caedus.<ref name=\"Revelation\" />\n\nA month into her training with Fett, Solo, increasingly aware of the Mandalorian predilection for adopting others into their culture, was invited to Mirta Gev's [[Wedding of Ghes Orade and Mirta Gev|wedding]], where, to the delight of Mandalorians, she opened numerous bottles of ale with the Force simultaneously. After learning of her own sordid family history shortly before her wedding, Gev approached Solo virtually in tears and revealed what she had discovered. Solo tried her best to assuage her fears and encouraged her to enjoy the day. While Beviin, Gev, and some of the other Mandalorians no longer saw her as a menace and a complete outsider, Fett himself remained as hard-edged and ruthless as always, and Solo overheard a conversation between him and Natasi Daala on ''Bloodfin'' about their mutual desire to be rid of both Jedi and Sith. Fett's trainings did develop a capability for total war in Solo, and she learned to not show compassion nor weakness in front of him or Beviin, who in particular advised her that a confrontation between her and Caedus needed to happen as she was the only one willing to handle the necessary job of killing him, though Solo preferred to capture him. Also, through discussion with former Jedi-turned-Mandalorian [[Bardan Jusik|Gotab]], Solo also came to the realization that because Caedus had lost everything that mattered in his life, he was now driven by the only things he had left to hold on to, his anger and hate. As a result, Solo's own hate for her brother was replaced with pity, and cemented her resolve to bring him down in order to end his miserable existence.<ref name=\"Revelation\" />\n\nShe later aided Fett and the Mandalorians in [[Battle of Roche|defending]] the [[Roche asteroid field]] from Imperial forces allied with Caedus, though there remained tension between her and Fett, and Solo resolved not to let on that she knew about his conversation with Daala. The battle saw the Roche asteroids overrun by Remnant forces and, after a brief clash with a group of stormtroopers, Solo was ordered to escape in a Mandalorian ''[[Bes'uliik]]'' starfighter by Fett, who said that she was prepared to face Caedus.<ref name=\"Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref>\n\n====Ending Caedus====\n{{Quote|Get ready, Caedus. Here I come.|Jaina Solo, during the [[Battle of Uroro Station|Battle of Shedu Maad]]|Legacy of the Force: Invincible}}\nJaina Solo returned to a temporary Jedi base on [[Shedu Maad]], where she was re-united with her parents and Jedi comrades. There, in a meeting with the Masters' Council where her parents and Jagged Fel were also present, she proposed that she go after Caedus to bring him down. To her surprise, the Masters relented after making sure she was willing to kill Caedus and that her actions were motivated by a sense of need and justice, not vengeance. For his part, Luke Skywalker explained that he could not hunt down Caedus himself, though he wanted to, as he would all-too-easily be carried away by his personal desire for vengeance for the death of his wife. Instead, Skywalker was seeing into Caedus's visions so that the Sith Lord saw Skywalker as the lone impediment to his achievements. Furthermore, Han and Leia agreed to accompany Solo to Coruscant on a mission to pursue Caedus, along with Ben Skywalker.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina_vs_Caedus.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaina battles [[Darth Caedus|her brother]].]]\nSolo and her mother followed Ben discreetly to [[Monument Plaza/Legends|Monument Plaza]] while he met with one of his local contacts, [[Lon Shevu]], a captain in the Galactic Alliance Guard. However, Shevu had been followed by Caedus's agents, including his apprentice Tahiri Veila. After Shevu was captured, Ben escaped from the two Solos, trying to keep them from being discovered. Leia and Solo attempted pursuit anyway after Veila captured Ben, but they were forced to break off the chase after Veila starting leading them into an obvious trap where they would be captured as well. Heart-stricken, they made their way back to their [[Sweet Time|ship]] and returned to Shedu Maad to inform Luke Skywalker that they had lost his son. As they broke the news to him, Skywalker informed them that he had already foreseen that possible future and allowed it to happen anyway, for the sake of bringing down Caedus.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nBen later escaped though, and brought word that Caedus was actually in the Roche system aboard Nickel One. At that point, Luke Skywalker had the Jedi Order launch an assault on the system with their StealthXs and new [[Skipray 24r Blastboat]]s. For her part, Solo was loaded into a [[dropsuit]] and carried into battle by a blastboat crewed by her parents, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Saba Sebatyne. As the Jedi attacked, Boba Fett's Mandalorians also arrived and began attacking the occupying forces as well, as Fett had given the Verpine his word that he would return. The Jedi allowed Fett's forces to take the brunt of the counter-fire and Solo was launched over Nickel One. Before she landed, she destroyed a pair of [[Starhunter]] fighters attacking her parents' blastboat, as well as dealing with an anti-fighter gun, but was saddened to see a Mandalorian landing party shredded by cluster mines before they could set down. Solo quickly entered the hangar and dealt with the guards before allowing the surviving Mandalorians, including Mirta Gev, into the hangar. Gev insisted that she and her group were after the Moffs and they demanded Solo accompany them, if only to help them against Caedus. With the aid of Nickel One's surveillance system, which Boba Fett had hijacked, the Mandalorian party quickly located the Moffs and attacked, over Solo's objections, as the Jedi still didn't know where Caedus was.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nThe Mandalorians attacked the Moffs and their bodyguards, but Caedus intervened before the bodyguards were defeated, turning the tide of the fight against the Mandalorians. Caedus personally slew several Mandalorians and while Solo attempted to kill him with a [[Sniper rifle/Legends|sniper rifle]], she only managed to hit him in the shoulder. As he defeated the last commando, she jumped down from her perch to engage him. They fought, and Solo sustained several injuries, including a head wound, though she managed to sever Caedus's arm. Furthermore, thanks to Skywalker's efforts, Caedus believed her to be Luke Skywalker. However, the duel began turning against her and she reluctantly decided to leave, escaping to the blastboat where her parents, Fel, and Skywalker were waiting. She was nearly delirious, mumbling nonsense as she was carried aboard the blastboat due to her head injury.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nWith Solo extracted, the Jedi forces returned to Shedu Maad to regroup. Solo recuperated during that time, though she also continued training in hand-to-hand combat and had Luke Skywalker teach her the [[Shatterpoint/Legends|shatterpoint]] skill, which she had observed Caedus use against a Mandalorian. Shortly afterward, Skywalker recognized that she had been marked with a Nightsister [[blood trail]], whereby Caedus could determine her location with the Force thanks to his blood that had splattered on her. Realizing that their safe house had been compromised, Skywalker prepared the Jedi for a last defense and final assault on Caedus. The Jedi were reinforced by the arrival of Tenel Ka's Hapan fleet, though the Queen Mother informed the Jedi that Prince [[Isolder]] had been captured by Caedus.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nSince she had been marked with the blood trail, Solo flew as Zekk's wingman in a StealthX, luring Caedus and his fleet into the [[Transitory Mists]] near Shedu Maad. Once they had gotten close enough, Skywalker launched his forces against the fleet as a diversion while Solo and Zekk swooped in on the ''Anakin Solo''. They were heavily battered by defensive fire on the first run, but after Skywalker's StealthXs had drawn away the hostile batteries, Solo and Zekk made their run on the ''Anakin Solo''. Both of their craft were hit and Solo was forced to eject, though she successfully landed on the ''Anakin Solo'' and hastily made her way inside.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nAs a Jedi raid to free Isolder had been aborted, Solo made her way to the detention block and, though she didn't find the Hapan prince, she did find Mirta Gev, who had survived the Battle on Roche One, albeit as a prisoner with a damaged spinal column. Caedus had tortured her, but she was still defiant. They both knew that Solo couldn't free her comrade at that instant, as Caedus was still running loose, so Jaina deactivated the restraints, gave Gev a blaster rifle, and continued onward. She found Caedus in the bio-disposal chamber of the ''Anakin Solo'', attempting to dispose of Isolder's body after having murdered him.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nSolo caught him off-guard, stabbing him in the abdomen, but Caedus didn't seem unduly hampered by the wound. The twins [[Battle of Uroro Station|fought]], with both liberally using Force powers and unarmed combat moves to punish the other as they struggled for an advantage. During the duel, Caedus told her that he had to warn Tenel Ka of a [[nanovirus]] targeted to her and Allana. Solo believed this to be a trap and engaged him relentlessly, no longer caring for her own survival if she was able to end the Sith menace. Their lightsabers finally connected with each other when Caedus slashed her across her stomach, while she cut his Achilles tendon. With only one arm and one good leg, Caedus could no longer prevent his death. Even though he could have ended the duel with a draw, he would have died anyway, so Caedus stopped fighting, disengaging his lightsaber and reached out in the Force, giving his life to warn Tenel Ka. By then, Solo had already slashed through his torso and his heart, killing him. She felt Jacen die through her twin bond, not Caedus. Solo then tearfully embraced his dead form and begged for her family's forgiveness. She was then extracted by Jagged Fel, who had arrived with a sizable Jedi team that had boarded the ''Anakin Solo'' to capture the Moffs and end the battle. Before she allowed herself to be carried away, she informed Fel of Gev's status. Her parents also arrived, finding their daughter cradling the body of the brother she had just killed.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nSolo was taken back off the ''Anakin Solo'' to a medical facility on a [[Hapan Battle Dragon]] to recover from the numerous injuries she sustained in the duel. Her parents came to visit her and informed her that the war was over, with Admiral Daala being chosen as the new [[Head of State (Imperial Remnant)|Head of State]] following Luke Skywalker's successful conclusion of the larger battle and the death of Caedus. She also learned that Jagged Fel had been chosen to administer the Moff Council, replacing the assassinated Grand Admiral [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]]. While Tenel Ka had survived the nanovirus attack, Allana had been reported dead. However, her parents introduced her to \"Amelia\"&mdash;actually Allana&mdash;whom they had adopted by Tenel Ka's request to keep her safe and train in the Jedi ways. Afterward, Solo reflected that perhaps Jacen had succeeded in his quest, that he had brought peace to the galaxy, sacrificing his name and life to do so.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\n===Picking up the pieces (43 ABY&mdash;45 ABY)===\n====Threats to stability====\n{{Quote|It's not a problem. ''We're'' going to be okay. ''That'' is just politics. And I'm not going to let a little thing like politics come between us. I'm not going to let ''anything'' come between us.|Jagged Fel, to Jaina Solo|Fate of the Jedi: Abyss}}\nIn [[43 ABY|43.5 ABY]], Jaina Solo was present when the [[Gilad Pellaeon (starship)|''Gilad Pellaeon'']] arrived over Coruscant as part of an Imperial presence at a [[Unification Summit|reunification summit]]. She was aboard a diplomatic shuttle accompanied by a Galactic Alliance delegation, but while Imperial head of state Jagged Fel's time was largely preoccupied with diplomatic matters, she was able to spend some time with him. He discussed the possibility of establishing some kind of Jedi presence in the Empire, for a number of reasons, but Solo was reluctant to support his idea.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nLater, Solo was also present at another unification summit meeting held on Coruscant attended by Fel, and was also in attendance shortly thereafter when Luke Skywalker was taken into custody by [[Galactic Alliance Security]] personnel. Though she was seething when Skywalker was [[The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances versus Luke Skywalker|arrested for criminal negligence]] leading to Jacen's fall, the elder Jedi accepted his fate quietly and without protest, and Solo likewise made no move of hostility. Skywalker was released after an arraignment on his own recognizance, but all the Jedi were aware that public opinion was being swiftly shifted against them.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\n[[File:Jagandjaina.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Solo shares a romantic moment with Fel.]]\nAfter fellow Jedi [[Valin Horn]], who had [[Force psychosis|gone seemingly insane]] and had to be placed in protective custody, escaped from the Jedi Temple, Solo participated in the pursuit effort. She was paired with Master [[Kyle Katarn]] for the mission, and followed Horn, who had stolen an X-wing, in an airspeeder. At one point, Horn was forced to eject from his craft and landed another vehicle manned by a [[Daala's special-missions force|group of bounty hunters]]. Solo followed him down, landing nearby Horn, who fled at seeing her presence. Solo attempted to follow but was hit by a weapon fired by [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] bounty hunter [[Dhidal Nyz]], which ensnared her in an electrified net. This caused her to lose her balance and fall off, but she was caught by Master Katarn, who freed her from the net. They received fire from the bounty hunters, but Solo's mother defended them with the quad lasers on the ''Millennium Falcon.'' Eventually, Horn was subdued by Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nHowever, the incident only served to intensify public opinion against the Jedi. While assigned by her own request as the official Jedi liaison to the Galactic Empire, Solo received catcalls and filth tossed at her. After the Galactic Alliance and Luke Skywalker negotiated a deal where Skywalker would be exiled for ten years or until he could prove he knew how Jacen had fallen, Solo was present at his send-off, and later at the first meeting held by interim Grand Master [[Kenth Hamner]]. Hamner informed the Jedi that they would be accompanied by [[Jedi supervisor|government observers]], an idea which Solo had little love for. She was even more angry when she learned that her observer would be [[Dab Hantaq]], an old acquaintance from the Yuuzhan Vong War who also bore a resemblance to her deceased brother Anakin. Solo complained about her observer to Hamner, who advised her to take up the matter with the Galactic Alliance while also asking her about the whereabouts of her parents; Solo evaded his questions. During this time, she was also assigned to study up on Nyz and the other bounty hunters who had pursued Valin Horn, and managed to sneak away to spend some more time with Fel, who once again tried to convince her to open a Jedi school in the Empire. She rebuffed him once more, telling him that serving as the Sword of the Jedi was her responsibility. While with Fel, she also visited Tahiri Veila, who was living alone, away from the Jedi, and asked her about Jacen, though Veila had little to offer.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nJaina Solo was present when Valin Horn was turned over to the Galactic Alliance and later at a [[The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances versus Valin Horn|court hearing]] when it was announced that he would be frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]], which she did not take well to. Refusing to be shackled by the Galactic Alliance observers, she organized a group of people into an informal organization called [[Darkmeld]], including fellow Jedi Tekli, former Intelligence agent and also Solo's former babysitter Winter Celchu, Fel, and Veila. Their job was to watch out for another renegade Jedi, [[Seff Hellin]], who had also been spotted near the Temple and was suspected of having the same condition that Horn had.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nOne night, Tekli found her and told her that Hellin had been spotted trying to get into the [[Armand Isard Correctional Facility]], where Horn was being held. From then on, the Darkmeld members constantly observed Hellin. On one occasion, Solo was nearly caught sneaking out of the Temple by her observer, Hantaq, but Fel pretended to be with her when she answered the comlink, and Hantaq backed down. Later, when Hellin was prepared to [[Raid on the Armand Isard Correctional Facility|break into the prison]] via a tunnel, Solo, accompanied by Hantaq, took a speeder to a nearby park to provide assistance. Managing to escape Hantaq, she was able to assist in capturing Hellin after Veila, Fel, and Celchu flushed their quarry.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nWhile pursuing the fugitive Hellin, Solo again encountered the bounty hunters they had encountered earlier, including Nyz, who snared Hellin with his net weapon. However, Solo cut the line on the net, allowing Hellin to drop to the ground and furthermore give time for the Jedi to retrieve Hellin. The Darkmeld team was then able to elude pursuit and returned to the Temple discreetly, bringing a sedated Hellin with them. Though a Galactic Alliance delegation, led by Captain [[Oric Harfard]] arrived the next day, Master Hamner denied knowledge of Hellin's whereabouts, as Solo had kept her organization secret from the Masters. However, she was eventually found out by Mon Calamari Master Cilghal, who confronted Solo and insisted that the other Darkmeld members keep her involved in their plans from then on, to which Solo agreed.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\n====Engagement====\n{{Quote|Sometimes to heal, you must first hurt.''\"<br />\"''In just a few words, you've summed up my love life.|Cilghal and Jaina Solo|Fate of the Jedi: Backlash}}\nAs Solo and Fel openly continued their relationship, the couple were increasingly harassed by the press, especially [[Journalist/Legends|journalist]] [[Javis Tyrr]]. This also meant that Solo's activities with Darkmeld were made more difficult by the need to remain incognito. Though the observers from the Galactic Alliance were withdrawn thanks to legal action by Twi'lek attorney [[Nawara Ven]], Tyrr incessantly harangued Solo.<ref name=\"Omen\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]''</ref>\n\nJaina Solo, along with her mother, attended a meeting of the Masters' Council shortly after Jedi [[Jysella Horn]] was affected by the same malady that had seized Valin Horn and Hellin. She was not pleased to learn that Jysella had been taken by the Galactic Alliance and frozen in carbonite, but there was little she could do. Afterward, she took her parents to the [[Jedi Temple Detention Center]] where Darkmeld had stashed Hellin, who was still raving mad.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\n[[File:Goodhunting.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaina with Tenel Ka and Allana]]\nIn order to escape scrutiny, Solo and Fel used a romantic date at the luxurious [[Indigo Tower]] restaurant as a pretense to make contact with Hellin and observe him one further. One evening, Solo headed to the fancy establishment to meet with Fel, only to use a set of doubles whom they left inside the private rooms of the restaurant. In this manner, they were able to elude Tyrr. However, the persistent journalist eventually caught up with them and went public with his story after an altercation at the [[Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition]]. Solo had been there, along with Han, Leia, Allana, and two other Jedi, [[Natua Wan]] and [[Radd Minker]], as part of a pet-shopping trip for Allana. While there, Wan experienced the same insanity as the younger Horns and Hellin and seized the control center, unleashing all of the caged animals and sparking pandemonium. Solo [[Animal bond|calmed]] some of the beasts and then searched for Wan. Encountering Tyrr, she made him divulge Wan's location. Working with Radd and Leia, Solo was able to subdue Wan and bring her back to the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\nHowever, Tyrr went public with her hiding of Hellin not long afterward, as he'd successfully managed to follow her. This led to an angry confrontation between Hamner and Daala. Solo was present at their meeting, as were Leia and Han. The end result was that Solo was confined to the Jedi Temple for two weeks, forced to apologize publicly for her role, and subjected to interviews by any reporters of Daala's choosing. Her punishment also included a day's worth of manual labor, and she bore it stoically, knowing that at least the Jedi had managed to retain both Hellin and Wan. After a day of hard work, Solo was publicly humiliated and tired. She returned to her quarters to find Fel there with a gourmet dinner. He comforted her over the meal, empathizing with her hardship and at its conclusion, he proposed marriage. At first, she was astonished, but then leaped into his arms in response.<ref name=\"Omen\" />\n\nWhile her relationship with Fel was at a high, relations between the Jedi Order and Daala's government continued to deteriorate. When Solo attempted to call Tahiri Veila, she did not receive an answer. She sent Jedi Knights [[Yaqeel Saav'etu]] and [[Bazel Warv]] to investigate, but they were unable to reach the former Jedi. Solo was furthermore alerted to the possibility that Saav'etu and Warv were susceptible to the same psychological affliction also by virtue of their background at [[Shelter]] during the Yuuzhan Vong War. As such, she and Fel were in position to intercept both of the Jedi when the insanity struck. While her parents were able to tranquilize Saav'etu, the initially compliant Warv proved harder to subdue and he struck her. However, they returned both victims to the Jedi Temple, but not before a Galactic Alliance Security squad arrived and attempted to detain both Saav'etu and Warv. The Jedi locked the Galactic Alliance out of the Temple and Solo attempted to depart with Fel in his [[limousine]]. While the GAS leader, Captain [[Atar]] was initially insistent that Solo be arrested, Fel reminded him that his vehicle had diplomatic immunity, and so they were allowed to pass unchallenged.<ref name=\"Abyss\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss]]''</ref>\n\nDuring their ride, Solo sensed that something was being hidden from her by Fel and asked about it. Fel agreed to tell her, but only after she promised to keep it secret. Solo agreed, and he revealed that he'd learned that Daala was planning on hiring Mandalorian warriors as a contingency plan to help restrain the Jedi. About this time, Solo discovered that a spy droid had been planted inside the hoverlimo. She quickly seized it, preventing it from returning to its owner, the holojournalist Javis Tyrr.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nLater, inside in her own quarters, Solo dismantled the droid and found the recording it had collected. She immediately commed Fel to discuss what she had found, but her parents arrived first. They told her that they too had learned about Daala's plan to hire the Mandalorians, but Solo inadvertently let on that she had already known about the deal from Fel. Her parents were immediately disgusted and infuriated that she had chosen not to reveal that to the rest of the Jedi and left just as Fel arrived. Solo then turned over the recording to Fel so his people could analyze it after telling him that Moff [[Drikl Lecersen]] had arranged for the recording, but she also told him that she wanted the evidence presented to Daala. Fel agreed and then departed. However, the Jedi Council, when informed about her prior knowledge of the Mandalorian arrangement, was less than pleased. They barred Fel from the Jedi Temple and strongly suggested she reconsider where her priorities were.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nSolo later masterminded a plan that involved herself, along with several leading Jedi Masters and Mirax Horn showing up near the [[Palem Graser Office Tower]] at a [[Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse]], the facility where Valin and Jysella Horn were held after being frozen in carbonite. Solo arrived and demanded to see the prisoners. As the facility was masquerading as a storage facility, the two attendants, [[Weeze]] and [[Rosii]], tried to play innocent, but eventually raised an alarm, and the arrival of a GAS response squad proved them wrong. Furthermore, as Solo had arranged a legal writ allowing the Jedi visitation, they were granted access to the younger Horns, along with numerous journalists, including Tyrr. The Jedi and their journalist entourage found that the Horn children were being displayed in the executive suites in an offensive manner. This preempted Mirax Horn to strike the facility commander, [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Wruq Retk]]. To divert the attention of the holocams from Horn's assault, Solo displayed the writ to the assembled journalists while encouraging Tyrr to ask if the Galactic Alliance was going to press charges against a bereaved mother. As Tyrr asked the question, Daala herself appeared and answered in the negative. Daala affirmed her position that she was in favor of equal justice and no abuses of power tolerated. She promised that the Horn children would be attended to properly and the Jedi departed. The entire mission had been in fact a diversion, allowing the elder Solos to leave Coruscant with the other Jedi victims of the mysterious illness, getting them out of Daala's reach.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nNot long afterward, Solo visited Fel, during which time there was a Javis Tyrr exclusive on the conversation overheard during the limo ride. Fel ordered to turn it off, saying that it wasn't important and that nothing would come between them.<ref name=\"Abyss\" /> Solo soon learned of a message from her uncle and cousin from Master Cilghal. The contents of the message warned of a large number of [[Lost Tribe of Sith|Sith]] who had fought with the Skywalkers. Solo insisted that she attend the subsequent Masters' meeting to discuss the discovery, to which Cilghal agreed. She also met with Fel after hearing about a [[Kidnap attempt in the Galactic Empire Embassy Complex|kidnapping attempt]] that he had single-handedly defeated. She was relieved that he had escaped and pointed out that his image would improve on account of him fending off the attack without her help, adding some legitimacy and machismo to his reputation, as well as quelling some of the rumors about her being his secret bodyguard.<ref name=\"Backlash\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Suvudu_Tyria-Jaina1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Knights Solo and Tainer fended off the Mandalorian assault on the Jedi Temple.]]\nAt the Masters' meeting that Solo attended, Master Hamner insisted that the Jedi needed to wait before launching any serious effort to deal with the Sith threat, saying that more information was needed. He did, however, implement measures to bring all of the active StealthX pilots, or as many of them as possible, to Coruscant in case they needed to depart quickly. Durron also personally told Solo that he wanted her in a StealthX in the event of a strike force being launched.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\nAfter another Jedi, [[Sothais Saar]], experienced the same conditions as the Horns and was [[Duel in the Senate Plaza|subdued]] by Master Cilghal, Solo was tasked with taking him to the Transitory Mists where the other Jedi-held victims were located. This measure was taken to avoid Galactic Alliance seizure of Saar. Solo went down to the shuttle bay and met with Jedi Knight [[Tyria Sarkin Tainer]], who was servicing a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class shuttle]]. They conversed briefly, discussing mechanical work and the ongoing live news feed, when Tainer noticed that the feed was being looped. Based on her background in intelligence work, she concluded that the Jedi Temple was about to come under attack.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\nHer suspicions were proved correct when several Mandalorians [[Raid on the New Jedi Temple|burst]] in through holes created by the use of shaped charges. Solo and Tainer fended off the withering assault, though Tainer was knocked unconscious. Solo managed to defeat four of the Mandalorians and escaped unharmed. The rest of the Jedi also repelled the other Mandalorian intruders, with no Jedi fatalities and several slain Mandalorians. However, this did cause the Jedi Temple to be surrounded by military units, preventing any covert StealthX launch.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\nSolo was present when her parents returned from assisting her uncle on Dathomir and collected Allana and her injured nexu pet [[Anji]] while her parents went to a meeting with Chief of State Daala. After their meeting, Solo learned that Daala had proposed a sort of reconciliation between the Jedi Order and the Galactic Alliance, although the terms were far from favorable to the Jedi. She was also present when acting Grand Master Hamner heard Daala's proposal from the elder Solos and though she disagreed with it initially, Hamner decided to go ahead and trust Daala. In part, this decision was made to test the limits of Daala's good will.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\nNot long afterward, Solo, Fel, the elder Solos and Allana dined at the [[Pangalactus]] Restaurant, which was filled with images of galactic locations and historical events. During their dinner, the party was [[Operation Duusha|attacked]] by a lone assailant, [[Kester Tolann]], bursting through a hole he had blasted in the wall. He was quickly shot and killed, but the assault was followed up by two Yuuzhan Vong Hunter droids. Solo acted quickly and used her lightsaber to destroy one while her mother deflected its fire and employed the Force to detonate the ordnance of the other droid in close proximity to its launchers, knocking the second YVH droid out as well. The assassination attempt failed, though Fel and the Solos were furious. Shortly thereafter, Solo unobtrusively observed a meeting between Fel and Imperial Moff Lecersen, who Fel believed might have been complicit in the attack. Though Lecersen betrayed no evidence of his involvement, it was actually him and a group of conspirators who had been behind the attempt.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\n====In search of the Sith====\n{{Quote|I shouldn't have asked this of you.

I'm sorry.|Solo and Fel, right before ending their engagement|Fate of the Jedi: Allies}}\nSolo later went to visit Fel during [[Trial of Tahiri Veila|Tahiri Veila's trial]], asking him to help her find competent legal counsel for Veila. He agreed to do so, arranging for Bothan lawyer [[Eramuth Bwua'tu]] to represent Veila. Solo attended some of the trial, though was later called to an emergency meeting of the Jedi Masters by Master Hamner, who informed them of a threat made by Daala against the families of the Jedi. Solo was in favor of quick and decisive action, but the Jedi Temple was still being monitored closely by the Galactic Alliance, who soon arranged for a contingent of Mandalorian mercenaries to [[Siege of the New Jedi Temple|encircle]] the Temple. Solo then attempted to procure Fel's help in either distracting Daala from the siege or providing some ships that would allow the Jedi to help Luke Skywalker, who was traveling with a group of Sith to confront the being named [[Abeloth]] that was believed to be behind the insanity afflicting Hellin, the younger Horns, and the others. Fel knew that aiding her would endanger his responsibility to the Remnant and agreed to talk to Daala in hopes of ending the siege, but could not promise more. At that point, Solo decided that their conflicting duties meant that their relationship would be too hard to continue and returned the engagement ring to him.<ref name=\"Allies\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Jaina_Apocalypse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jaina, during the rise of Abeloth]]\nShe then took off on her own in a StealthX, arriving over [[Klatooine/Legends|Klatooine]] where she believed her uncle and cousin were waiting. Instead, she met Lando Calrissian in the [[Colossus I Beta Series asteroid tug|asteroid tug]] ''[[Rockhound]]'', which was escorted by a Sith frigate. Solo would have preferred to leave immediately to follow her uncle into the Maw Cluster, but a dispute on Klatooine caught their attention. A [[Starstalker|Sith ship]] had apparently attempted to desecrate the [[Fountain of Ancients]] on Klatooine and the failure of the Hutts to halt this intrusion represented a possible violation of the [[Treaty of Vontor]]. As neutral offworlders, Solo and Calrissian were called upon to arbitrate between the Sith who had [[Violation|violated]] the Fountain of the Ancients and the Hutts who were supposed to guard it. They journeyed down to Klatooine, though Solo chafed at the delay. At the hearing, the [[Leeha Faal|Sith leader]] claimed that the [[Vyn Holpur|captain of the offending ship]] had acted on his own accord, and had no qualms about releasing him for judgment, even death. Solo and Calrissian reviewed the evidence and concluded that the Hutts had attempted to uphold their end of the Treaty, pronouncing the allegedly rogue Sith captain and his crew guilty. Neither Solo nor Calrissian were convinced that Holpur had acted on his own, but they lacked proof to verify their belief.<ref name=\"Allies\" />\n\nWith that matter settled, she left and [[Mission to the Maw|followed]] her uncle into the Maw along with Calrissian and the [[Winged Dagger|remaining Sith vessel]]. After learning of the destruction of [[Sinkhole Station]], they were able to reach [[Abeloth's planet]], where the Skywalkers and a sizable force of Sith descended to deal with Abeloth. Solo remained in orbit and fought the [[Ship (Sith Meditation Sphere)|meditation sphere]] that Abeloth had been using. Solo attempted to fight it in her StealthX, but sustained severe damage to her ship, while the meditation sphere left after crippling her craft. Meanwhile, Skywalker was successful in ending Abeloth on the surface, but decided to investigate its origins further. He sent Solo and Calrissian back to Coruscant with their report in ''Rockhound'', which worried Solo, as three Sith warriors remained with the two Skywalkers.<ref name=\"Allies\" />\n\nHowever, on their return, Calrissian and Solo found that ''Rockhound'' had been sabotaged by means of a droid that had boarded on Klatooine. The droid had then proceeded to impersonate Calrissian and issue myriad commands to the ship's droid crew that were deleterious to their mission. These impediments meant that ''Rockhound'' emerged from the Maw Cluster at the wrong location, near [[Ashteri's Cloud]]. Upon discovering their predicament, Solo ordered Calrissian to find and neutralize the saboteur droid while taking off in her damaged StealthX over his protestations, since the craft had had its weapon systems weakened on top of its previous damage. She thanked him for his concern, but was resolute in her plan and took off in the damaged StealthX. Solo was unsurprised to see several pirate-filled modified [[BDY crew skiff]]s approaching ''Rockhound''. She [[Skirmish near Ashteri's Cloud|engaged]] them after one warning, using her four remaining shadow bombs to destroy numerous ships. To her surprise, the pirates were able to determine her location every time she used the Force to propel the shadow bombs, leading Solo to deduce that they were not typical pirates, but actually Lost Tribe Sith. After inflicting significant casualties and fending off the pirates from boarding ''Rockhound'', Solo landed aboard the asteroid tug once Calrissian was ready to jump to hyperspace, completing their escape.<ref name=\"Vortex\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex]]''</ref>\n\nUpon their return to Coruscant, Solo and Calrissian warned the Jedi Council of the current situation between the Sith and the Skywalkers, as well as their discovery that the Sith were posing as pirates. Further research on the part of Solo and Calrissian also revealed that the Sith piratical activities also explained a number of previous raids, which had a greater goal of developing a war fleet.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\nSolo, Calrissian, as well as her parents then went to visit Jedi-sympathetic [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] senator [[Luewet Wuul]], asking for his help in writing a bill that would legitimize the Jedi Order and guarantee them financial and military backing from the Galactic Alliance. Wuul agreed to aid them, but to distract Daala from his proceedings, asked Solo to encourage Jagged Fel to divert Daala's attention by complicating negotiations to incorporate the Empire into the Galactic Alliance. Solo had no immediate answer for him, as her break-up with Fel was not public knowledge, but her mother explained for her, though Wuul was confident she could recover her relationship with Fel.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\nAlthough the Jedi Order had been able to pressure Daala into lifting the siege of the Jedi Temple by demonstrating the recovery of the deranged Jedi patients, tensions remained high, particularly since Valin and Jysella Horn remained in Galactic Alliance custody and the Jedi were not permitted to launch their StealthXs in support of the Skywalkers. Jedi violence against Mandalorians sent to suppress a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] [[Blaudu Sextus slave revolt|revolt]] on [[Blaudu Sextus]] did little to defuse hostility between the government and Jedi Order. As a vocal proponent of more aggressive handling of the situation, Solo quickly became involved in a plan to free the Horn children.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\n====Reconciliation and retribution====\n{{Quote|For now, we can't ''not'' keep secrets from each other. All we can do&hellip;''\"<br />\"''Is not be angry for it. Ever again.|Fel and Solo after their reconciliation|Fate of the Jedi: Conviction}}\nWhile Solo and her parents were at a stakeout observing [[Galactic Alliance Security Detention Center 81]], where the Horn children were held, they were discovered by Fel. Solo was perturbed that he had found them, but Fel insisted on some explanations from her, saying that he had little time to waste with irritation on his finding them. He asked her why the Jedi&mdash;namely the Skywalkers and Solo on Klatooine&mdash;had been working with the newly-discovered Sith. Solo explained the situation about needing to work with them temporarily to destroy Abeloth, whom the Skywalkers had revealed was not dead, and he accepted her explanation. He then advised them to launch whatever action they planned immediately, informing them that he had just rejected Daala's request for Imperial aid and that she planned on making the public aware of Jedi cooperation with the Sith. Solo thanked him for informing them, and he also told her that he was leaving, as the Empire had ultimately decided not to join the Galactic Alliance. Fel and Solo then spared a few minutes to themselves, which led to reconciliation of some of their issues, including an apology from Solo for asking so much of him. Afterward, Solo returned to wearing the engagement ring that Fel had given her, though their engagement was not officially reinstated.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\n[[File:JainaCard.jpg|thumb|right|Jaina Solo]]\nSolo participated in the [[Raid on Detention Center 81|mission]] to free the Horn children, joining a two-part intrusion team that included herself, her parents, R2-D2, C-3PO, Zekk and his fianc\u00e9e [[Taryn Zel]] and several other Jedi. Posing as pest exterminators, they were able to gain access to the exterior of the building and launched a direct assault, blasting their way inside with thermal detonators. Solo and the others disabled all resistance from the guards, using stun grenades and blasters set to stun to good effect. Solo, her parents, and Zekk were able to defeat over fifty guards and enter the secure bunker where the frozen Jedi were located. After finding the Horn children, they extracted them as GAS reinforcements arrived. Solo and Zekk escaped onto a waiting news van piloted by two other Jedi, while her parents and the Horn children, still frozen in carbonite, were extracted by another speeder via a hole blasted in the roof of the facility with a thermal detonator. They then returned to the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\nConcurrent with the rescue, many Jedi also piloted StealthXs out of Coruscant, thanks to an orbital diversion by the ''Errant Venture'', which was firing on orbital facilities while hosting one hundred of Coruscant's politicians in a [[Tendrando Arms Celebrity Sabacc Charity Challenge|sabacc tournament]] so that the orbiting Galactic Alliance ships could not fire on it. Based on a message from the Skywalkers, the StealthX pilots, accompanied by the ''Venture'', arrived over [[Pydyr]] while Abeloth fled the moon, and they joined Luke and Ben Skywalker in [[Battle in the Fallanassi village|battle]] against a Lost Tribe assault force. While the Sith were defeated, Abeloth was once more able to escape. Back on Coruscant, Solo and the remaining Jedi prepared for a confrontation with Daala. Following the death of Kenth Hamner in a [[Skirmish in the Operations Hangar|power struggle]], Saba Sebatyne took temporary leadership of the Jedi Order and prepared to defend against the retribution that they expected from Daala. Sebatyne asked Solo to suggest to Fel that he remain on Coruscant longer.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\nSebatyne quickly decided that the best course of action was to remove Daala from power before she could strike at the Jedi. Solo agreed and participated in a meeting at the Jedi Temple where plans to unseat the Chief of State were discussed. Means of distracting Daala's attention from the infiltration of Jedi Masters [[Octa Ramis]] and Kyp Durron into close proximity of Daala were among the topics covered, and Solo weighed in. One of the ideas was using Jedi Knight [[Seha Dorvald]], falsely accused of poisoning, as a decoy to distract the Chief of State while Ramis and Durron sought to get close enough to Daala to subdue her. Solo later met with Fel to discuss recent events, but the conversation was largely fruitless due to their respective need for secrecy in many of the subjects of inquiry. However, they resolved to accept their mutual needs to keep secrets and not let that issue compromise their relationship.<ref name=\"Conviction\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''</ref>\n\nSolo then helped with the planning for the coup and was advised by the Jedi Masters that an [[Plan Delta|option]] involving the maximal use of non-Jedi assets was likely. She was also advised that Dorvald and a simulated attack on the [[Senate Building]] were being employed as diversions for Daala. When the Jedi learned that Daala was planning on a punitive strike on Klatooine using Mandalorians, they decided to depose Daala before the bloodthirsty order could be carried out. Solo, Horn, and Sebatyne were infiltrated into the Senate Building via the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} concealed compartments. Battling off guards, they used a turbolift shaft to gain access to the Senate chamber by jumping onto the top of an ascending car to ride most of the way to their destination, leaping the rest of the way. Solo, Horn, and Sebatyne were able to reach the Senate chamber, where the Senate was in session. Sebatyne then negotiated a power-sharing arrangement with Senator [[Haydnat Treen]] and the heads of the armed forces for a temporary power-sharing arrangement in lieu of Daala's capture by Solo's parents, Durron, and Ramis. The Jedi, military, and Senate heads constituted a [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate|Triumvirate]] that held temporary power until a proper replacement for the deposed executive could be named.<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\nFollowing the successful coup, Solo was present at Kenth Hamner's [[Funeral of Kenth Hamner|funeral]]. While there, she consoled Corran Horn, whose children had been unfrozen but had subsequently proven to still be under Abeloth's influence and had fled. Solo later met with Fel again after he made a pro-Jedi speech in response to the coup. She chided him for drawing the ire of Imperial public opinion upon himself and he told her that he was doing his job, just as she had done her own by removing Daala. He also told her that he was not angry with her, even though she had obviously concealed knowledge of the Jedi-led coup from him. His response mollified her, but she was forced to inform him of a new imminent offworld assignment about which she could divulge few details. They shared dinner, and then she departed to rejoin a sizable Jedi StealthX force that Luke Skywalker had beckoned to [[Nam Chorios/Legends|Nam Chorios]].<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\nThe StealthXs were used to [[Operation Shieldfall|ambush]] a Sith strike force that arrived over the planet, attempting to extract Abeloth from the world. Solo answered a call from Skywalker asking for extraction for his party from the surface of the world and, along with Zekk and Tyria Sarkin Tainer, escorted a shuttle down to retrieve them. Skywalker borrowed Tainer's starfighter and gave chase to Abeloth's meditation sphere. His craft drew fire from the orbital stations protecting Nam Chorios and was severely damaged. In response, Solo and Zekk drew their fire so Skywalker's ship could be recovered safely. Meeting Skywalker after he recuperated from numerous injuries, she informed him that both the Sith task force and Abeloth had escaped, after sustaining varying amounts of damage. He was initially displeased that she had saved him instead of destroying Abeloth, but she told him that the Force had led her to do so. She also told him that both of the Horn children, who had journeyed to Nam Chorios, had recovered from Abeloth's influence and that the local Force-using [[Theran Listener]]s who had also been subverted by Abeloth had additionally been freed from being under Abeloth's sway.<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\n====The hunt for Abeloth====\n{{Quote|Uncle Luke, you take us to the nicest places.|Jaina to Luke, upon their arrival in Dromund Kaas' orbit|Fate of the Jedi: Ascension}}\nSolo communicated with the Skywalkers and Khai via [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] as they sought to track down Abeloth. Suspecting that Abeloth would seek refuge among the Lost Tribe, Luke attempted to glean the location of their homeworld from Khai, who refused to divulge the location to him, as she feared that the discovery of her homeworld would lead to the genocide of her people. However, she revealed the Tribe's plan for Abeloth, which was to enslave and use her to accomplish their goals&mdash;though she was unsure of what those goals were. Unable to acquire any more information from Khai, the group dismissed the topic and Solo pitched the idea of finding Ship instead, theorizing that if they were to find the ancient Sith vessel, they would also find Abeloth. The group agreed with Solo's theory and she arranged for Jedi Knight Natua Wan to research Ship and Sith worlds that would be possible destinations for Ship.<ref name=\"Ascension\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Ascension]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Jaina_Solo.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Jaina Solo in her flight suit]]\nWith Wan's help, Solo, the Skywalkers, and Khai were able to comprise a list of planets that were deemed possible locations for Ship. After sorting out the information, the Jedi fleet split up to search the planets. Solo rejoined Khai and the Skywalkers aboard the ''Jade Shadow'' and they traveled first to [[Korriban]], the original homeworld of the Sith. Solo&mdash;despite her suspicions of Khai&mdash;invited the young Sith to join them planetside, much to Luke's chagrin. Though Solo convinced Luke that Khai's presence was a logical necessity, the older Jedi remained reluctant, and he insisted that they watch her closely.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nUpon their arrival in Korriban's orbit, they sensed an abundance of dark side energy. While it unnerved the Jedi, it simultaneously awed and excited Khai, who had been eager to explore its origin. They landed in the [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|Valley of the Dark Lords]] and immediately began their search at a nearby citadel, which they found to be long-deserted. The four came up empty in their search. As they voiced their disappointment, they were approached by a group of [[Tuk'ata/Legends|tuk'ata]] Sith hounds. However, before the hounds could attack, Khai stepped forward to engage them. Conversing with them in the [[Sith (language)|Sith]], Khai ordered the hounds not to harm the group and the hounds obeyed, leaving the group alone. Their behavior toward Khai heightened Solo's suspicion, causing her to question the young Sith. Unsurprised by Solo's barrage of inquiries, Khai revealed the details of her conversation with the hounds. According to Khai, the hounds were unable to locate any Sith on the planet&mdash;a fact that Solo and the Skywalkers had already suspected. The four then decided to continue their search elsewhere.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nThe group journeyed to the next world in question, [[Dromund Kaas]]. The planet's history shared numerous similarities to Khai's homeworld, which caused Luke to reconsider his original decision to allow her to accompany the Jedi on their search. Khai argued that they had three choices: they could kill her, leave a member behind to guard her while the other two completed the mission, or they could take her with them. Luke agreed to let Khai join them, recognizing it as the most sensible option. They landed on the planet's surface and made their way to a [[Dark Force Temple|temple]] that was surrounded by a powerful dark-side [[Force nexus]]. They split up into groups of two&mdash;with Solo and Luke in the first group and Ben and Khai in the second&mdash;and explored various areas of the temple. As with their search on Korriban, their search on Dromund Kaas initially turned up nothing, leaving the group disappointed once again. As they prepared to leave, however, they were ambushed by ten Sith Sabers under the command of Khai's father, Gavar Khai.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nSolo immediately brandished her lightsaber and readied herself for battle. In accordance with Luke and Ben, she instantly suspected that Khai had betrayed them, and her distrust of Khai flared up once more. To everyone's surprise, however, Khai decided to stand with the Jedi, raising her own lightsaber against the Sith. Khai engaged her father in a duel while Solo and the Skywalkers each dueled three members of Gavar's strike team. The three Jedi and Khai slew their assailants, but Khai was forced to kill her own father. Solo and Ben rushed to comfort Khai, and Solo sympathized with her emotional turmoil. She revealed that she had also been forced to kill her own kin&mdash;Darth Caedus. Solo told Khai that she would always miss her brother, but she knew that she had made the right decision. Meanwhile, Skywalker took note of the Sith team's small numbers and deduced that the Sith had caught on to the Jedi plan and had sent the team to ambush them near the temple while leaving their main fleet elsewhere. Khai revealed that she had sensed that the members of the Lost Tribe that had attacked them had fallen under Abeloth's will. Afterward, Luke decided that they should return to Coruscant to recuperate. Shortly thereafter, Solo contacted Wan, who was still conducting research at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and learned that she had found a new lead on Ship. Wan decided not to divulge the piece of news right away, as she wanted to verify it first, but Solo was eager to inform Luke of what she had learned.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\n====Conflicting desires====\n{{Quote|I knew you would understand duty.''\"<br />\"''Oh, I do. I also know that it's what you want.''\"<br />\"''Jag, don't think for a minute I&mdash;''\"<br />\"''I know you want to be with me. I want that, too. And we'll have that eventually&hellip;or we won't. You don't just feel obligated to travel with the Jedi&mdash;you want to, just as much as you want to be with me. And all of that is okay.|Jaina Solo and Jagged Fel|Fate of the Jedi: Ascension}}\nSolo and Luke were later contacted by Solo's mother, who brought them up to speed on the events occurring on Coruscant. Leia touched briefly on the subject of Daala, telling the pair that she discovered a lead on the former Chief of State's whereabouts. Solo and Luke ended their discussion shortly after, and Solo told him about Wan's new lead on Ship. Although Luke was pleased, he found his mind wandering to Khai, who was now considering taking up the Jedi path and was forming a budding relationship with Ben. He sought advice from Solo, inquiring about her parents and how they dealt with her relationships with both Fel and Zekk. According to Solo's own account of that period, the problems that her parents initially had with the two men stemmed from their inability to handle her maturity into adulthood, as they were absent during much of her early childhood years. As Solo advised Luke, he grew more at ease with the relationship, and even joked about the possibility of grandchildren.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nUpon returning to the Jedi temple, Solo, accompanied by Ben and Khai, sought out Wan and thanked her for her help. Solo's gratitude was warmly received by Wan, who also told the group that she had found another lead on Ship. After conducting more research, Wan believed that Ship was on the planet [[Upekzar]]. Solo, already aware of Wan's lead, feigned surprise. Wan gave them a quick briefing on the planet and its history, revealing that the Sith who resided there had based their culture on their contact with the [[rhak-skuri]], a bug in the [[diplura]] family that secreted [[Pheromone/Legends|pheromones]] with hallucinogenic properties. Wan went on to report that many of their dark side rituals and rites were performed&mdash;without protection from the hallucinations&mdash;in the volcanic caves where the rhak-skuri resided. The group then decided to search into the planet's volcanic caves, where they hoped to find Ship's nesting area. When their impromptu meeting was over, Solo invited Wan to join the Jedi fleet on their search, feeling that the Falleen Jedi had rightfully earned the opportunity to participate.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina_et_Jag_Sakuub.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Jaina struggled to balance her love for Jagged Fel with her sense of duty.]]\nAfter informing Luke of what had transpired, she spent some time with Fel. She was briefly interrupted by a transmission from her parents, who contacted Fel to inform him of their expedition offworld. Solo and Fel later watched reporter [[Perre Needmo]]'s daily show, ''[[The Perre Needmo Newshour]]'', during which Luke revealed his decision to pull the Order out of Coruscant and sever its political ties to the Galactic Alliance. While it would no longer serve as an official branch of government, the Jedi would still continue to aid the Alliance in times of need. The new development created another obstacle in Solo and Fel's relationship, as her position within the organization compelled her to support Luke, even though it meant that she would be away from Fel. They decided to withhold the discussion until later, refusing to let it hamper their joyful reunion.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nThe next day, before they departed for the elder Solos' safe house, Solo and Fel discussed the negative repercussions of Luke's decision and the impact it would have on their relationship. Although Fel was saddened by the prospect of parting from her yet again, he understood her desire to be with the Jedi. He also revealed that, after their meeting with the Solos, he planned to return to [[Imperial Space]] to attend to political matters. Solo and Fel then joined her parents for a surprise dinner shortly thereafter, and discovered that Tahiri Veila&mdash;who had [[Escape from the Armand Isard Correctional Facility|escaped]] execution&mdash;had sought refuge with the Solos. Veila had turned herself over to them in the hopes that they would help her atone for the acts she committed during her stint as Caedus' apprentice&mdash;in particular, the assassination of Gilad Pellaeon, which had earned her Fel's ire. As her crime against Pellaeon fell under the Imperial Remnant's jurisdiction, the Solos hoped that Fel would grant Veila another trial in an Imperial court. However, Fel decided to hear the details of the elder Solos' trip into Imperial Space first before making his decision.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nAdhering to Fel's request, they told Solo, Fel, and Veila about their meeting with the Squibs [[Emala]], [[Grees]], and [[Sligh]]&mdash;old friends of the Solos&mdash;on the planet [[Roonadan]]. According to them, the Squibs had been working with an Imperial Remnant faction that remained loyal to Fel to debunk Daala, and managed to procure a recording of the former Chief of State. In it, Daala detailed her plan to assassinate Fel and take his place as the Imperial Head of State; and she also revealed her co-conspirators, one of whom was Moff [[Porrak Vansyn]]. Han and Leia's recount of the ordeal perplexed Fel, who was previously unaware that the Squibs were conducting missions on the Imperial Remnant's behalf. However, after giving it much consideration, Fel decided that he would talk to the Squibs, who were now in the care of a few of the Solos' friends. He then announced that he was returning to Imperial Space to confront Daala, and decided to bring Veila along with him as his guard.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nThe next day, Solo returned to the Jedi Temple, where she prepared her ship for [[Mission to Upekzar|departure]]. Avoiding the reception of beings that gathered outside of the vicinity, she bade her family and Fel one final farewell before taking off for Upekzar with the Jedi fleet. However, soon after they left, Solo received word that her mother had been captured by the Sith, who had seized the opportunity to invade the planet. Furious, Solo confronted Luke, and inquired as to why he allowed the event to transpire. When Luke told her of his plan to lure the Sith into a trap her anger dissipated, although she remained worried for her mother's safety.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\nThe Jedi fleet descended upon Upekzar's surface, landing near the main city. Luke charged Wan, Ben, and Khai with the task of exploring a group of caves while he and his team&mdash;consisting of more than one hundred Jedi, including Solo&mdash;hunted down Ship. The team started their search in the city's tunnels, where they sensed several dark side presences. Jedi Master Kyle Katarn surmised that souls of previously deceased Sith were trapped on the planet&mdash;an opinion that Solo voraciously refuted. The team managed to track the source of a massive dark side energy to a gated area, located in the center of the city. After Luke successfully pried the gates with the Force, he ordered the Jedi to activate their lightsabers and follow him through the threshold. Solo obliged and followed the others into the open area, where they found [[Tola Annax]], a [[Keshiri]] Sith Saber who had once served under Gavar Khai. Annax begged the Jedi to free her from her imprisonment, which had been forced upon her by Abeloth. Annax revealed that Abeloth had stripped her of her powers and converted her body into a container for the massive amount of dark side energy that permeated the planet. Although Luke felt a tinge of remorse for the Keshiri Sith, he realized that it was a deliberate trap and ordered the Jedi to retreat. As Solo and the Jedi fled, Annax's body&mdash;unable to contain the energy&mdash;erupted, setting off an explosion that roused a nearby volcano out of its dormant state. The unstable environment created by the volcano's renewed activity forced the Jedi to flee to their transports. They recovered Ben and Khai shortly after&mdash;although Wan had been killed in the caves&mdash;and fled the planet.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\n====The fight for Coruscant====\n{{Quote|Can you move on your own?''\"<br />\"''I'm good.

I've been doing this a long time.|Jaina Solo and Ben Skywalker|Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse}}\nDuring the absence of the Jedi Order from Coruscant on the mission to Upekzar, the Lost Tribe of Sith, governed by Abeloth who had recently possessed Senator [[Rokari Kem]] and arranged her own installment as Chief of State, took control of Coruscant and the government of the Galactic Alliance. In response to this alarming chain of events, Luke Skywalker masterminded a plan that would see numerous members of the Jedi Order infiltrate Coruscant while the Sith tried to manage the power transfer and consolidate their holdings while maintaining a semblance of normalcy in the galactic capital. Luke planned to capitalize on the fact that the Sith takeover was covert and minimally disruptive&mdash;most of the populace was unaware of the true nature of the new rules&mdash;by slipping numerous Jedi onto Coruscant. Solo was with a large group of Jedi on the starship ''[[Plain Lady]]'', disguised in order to avoid the Sith inspectors. Once the Jedi had arrived on Coruscant, Luke assigned various Sith that were occupying key public positions as targets for Jedi teams, who would [[Liberation of Coruscant (Lost Tribe of Sith emergence)|simultaneously strike]] against as many of the Sith as possible. Solo and Jysella Horn were sent to take out [[Tela Rovas]], a Sith who had been installed as the [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Court of Justice]]. However, when the attacks started, Rovas took care to screen herself with other judges. Under strict orders not to harm civilians, Solo and the young Horn withdrew. Across Coruscant, many Sith were killed in the sudden strike, paving the way for the next phase of Luke's plan.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nWith no way to effectively defend themselves against the sudden onslaught, the Sith withdrew into the Jedi Temple and fortified it. Luke then ordered an infiltration that would shut down the shield generators protecting the temple while friendly military units under Admiral Nek Bwua'tu attacked the temple from the outside. Solo conducted Ben Skywalker and Vestara Khai to a pumping station where they used a maintenance capsule to travel down the water lines and gain access to the temple, where her droid Rowdy would use an interface panel to disable the shields. Khai protested her lack of a weapon, but Solo reminded her that as a former Sith, she had yet to fully earn the trust of the Jedi Order. When Ben and Khai were ambushed by a group of Sith, Solo arrived to assist them and killed multiple Sith. She helped defend her cousin in the melee, but while she slew a Sith plunging down on her from above, his body crushed her, breaking ribs. Solo continued to fight and defeated several more attackers, but not before sustaining further injuries from Force lightning. Meanwhile, Khai had been captured. While the smitten Ben wanted to immediately chase after her, Solo was able to persuade him not to embark on such a foolhardy venture. The entire Jedi Temple was apparently prepared for their attack and the Jedi force encountered heavy resistance.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nThe strike team then attempted to override the controls to the lockdown in which the Jedi Temple had been placed, but they were again attacked by the Sith. Solo used a jet of water to divert and disrupt the attackers, slaying their leader, but received a leg wound from a grenade blast. Receiving fire from a Sith sniper, she and Ben fell back at the mental direction of Luke Skywalker. The Jedi Grand Master directed her and the pursuing Sith into an ambush of his own. Luke Skywalker, Corran, Valin, and Jysella Horn fell upon the Sith force and handily defeated them. At this point, Rowdy informed them that the control interface had been disabled and had them cut their way towards another interface via a cargo chute. Solo was assigned to a rearguard action as they plunged through the cargo chute, fending off numerous Sith en route and once she arrived in the repair bay where the chute ended. A single blast hit her in the side, hampering her breathing, but she continued to fight as the Sith spilled out of the cargo chute after them until its portal was destroyed by Jysella, killing any remaining pursuers. Ben attempted to negotiate with one of the remaining Sith in the repair bay to trade for Khai, but the Sith used his diversion to stab the young Jedi in the leg with a ''[[shikkar]]'' knife before he was slain. Solo chastised Ben for his inattentiveness and treated the wound. Learning that all the interfaces had been disabled from Rowdy, the Jedi team realized they would need to fight their way to the central computer core if they were to successfully use that avenue disable the shields.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina_vs_Vestara.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Jaina tries to arrest Vestara Khai.]]\nHowever, the Jedi would not have an easy path to their objective. Luke and Ben Skywalker, Corran Horn, and Solo struggled for two days of constant evasion, combat, and forced healing trances before they were in position to reach not the heavily-defended core but instead one of the shield generators. During this time, Solo managed to communicate long-distance with Fel, arranging the use of a StealthX and shadow bombs for him. Fel loaned the vehicle and weaponry to Tahiri Veila, who was with him at the time. The weapons were used in an attempt to wipe out an incarnation of Abeloth that was now working with Daala, whom Fel was pitted against in a political and military struggle. Solo also said her goodbyes to Fel, knowing that she was not likely to survive the prolonged combat inside the temple.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nAs the most injured member of the quartet, Solo was drawing heavily on the Force to enhance her stamina in combat and was suffering from [[Force euphoria]] as her cells were slowly consumed by overuse of the Force to sustain herself. The party faced a group of Sith led by the Sith Lady [[Korelei]], who had been possessed by Abeloth. Solo volunteered to be the first one to assault the position, knowing that her severely injured state made her most useful as a diversion for the others since she was not likely not to survive. Just before she embarked on her attempt, Luke Skywalker promoted her to Jedi Master. Solo fought her way to the shield generator through the Sith, followed by Corran Horn, but Solo collapsed from sheer exhaustion and injury-induced weakness while Abeloth attacked Horn with Force lightning. Mustering her last vestiges of strength, Solo rose to confront Abeloth before the entity could slay Horn. She was prepared to die to delay Abeloth, but suddenly Abeloth fled unexpectedly due to Veila destroying the other incarnation of Abeloth light years away on [[Hagamoor III]]. This sudden lapse in the defense allowed the Jedi team to destroy the shield generators, permitting the allied [[Void Jumper]] soldiers to begin their assault on the Jedi Temple. However, Ben was captured by Abeloth.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nSolo was rescued by friendly military forces and taken to a field medcenter where her wounds were treated and she was immersed in bacta for four days while the battle for the Jedi Temple continued to rage. Though not fully healed when she emerged, she was called to a Jedi Council meeting as its newest member. Solo was informed that Abeloth was also living in the computer core while using the Force to cause massive seismic disturbances on Coruscant and also had captured Ben. Learning the history of Abeloth and [[The Ones]], a family of powerful [[Force wielder/Legends|Force wielders]] who embodied different characteristics of the Force who had once lived with her, Solo realized that Abeloth was trying to recreate her old family, who had perished years ago. In Abeloth's mind, Ben would become the next embodiment of the light side of the Force. Solo also learned that Vestara Khai had betrayed the Jedi Order by attacking Solo's parents and niece, having allied herself temporarily with Abeloth. Shortly thereafter, Abeloth's Lady Korelei incarnation fled the Jedi Temple to her [[Abeloth's planet|homeworld]] with Ben and Khai in Ship. Luke and Jaina headed for the Maw in the frigate ''[[Redstar]]'' and then gave chase in a pinnace [[Infiltrator/Legends|infiltrator]] called [[Rude Awakening (freighter)|''Rude Awakening'']]. Solo flew ''Rude Awakening'' into the Maw Cluster, where she engaged Ship in a narrow corridor of space bounded by black holes. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker had an out of body experience, going [[Beyond shadows]], where he and a [[Darth Krayt|Sith Lord]] combined their powers, along with those of Ben and Khai, to defeat Abeloth. Both Ship and ''Rude Awakening'' took heavy damage during the fight, but the space combat was inconclusive.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nOnce Abeloth was defeated, Ship fled, allowing Solo to fly ''Rude Awakening'' down to the planet where Ben and Khai were. Since Luke Skywalker was comatose from his struggle against Abeloth, it was left to Solo to find Ben and Khai. She found them and was able to speak to Ben in private, warning him of Khai's treachery. This revelation deeply grieved Ben, as he was in love with Khai, but he also knew that there was little recourse but to subdue Khai to prevent her from escaping or attacking them again. Solo and Ben attempted to sedate Khai, but she fled on the suddenly-reappearing Ship. As both Skywalkers were heavily injured, Solo took them back to rendezvous with ''Redstar'' whereupon they returned to Coruscant. The battle for the Jedi Temple had been won at heavy cost and the majority of the Lost Tribe of Sith hunted down, while a new government formed under Wynn Dorvan's leadership. However, the devastation caused by the conflict caused the Jedi to relocate from Coruscant to their secret base at Shedu Maad. Meanwhile, Fel had defeated Daala both politically and in battle, but abdicated in favor of Imperial Admiral [[Vitor Reige]].<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\n====Wedding and honeymoon====\n{{Quote|So we get at least one night in a bed?''\"<br />\"''I thought you might appreciate that.|Jagged Fel and Jaina Solo|Getaway}}\nShortly thereafter, Jaina Solo [[Wedding of Jagged Fel and Jaina Solo|married]] Jagged Fel on the Hapan flagship ''[[Dragon Queen II]]'', surrounded by her friends and family.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" /> For their honeymoon, Solo took Fel to the remote world of [[Sakuub]] in a [[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub]] [[Horizon-class star yacht|''Horizon''-class star yacht]] on what was ostensibly a hiking trip, while their doubles maintained the charade that they were on Hapes. Fel was unconvinced and eventually forced her to reveal that the motivation behind her trip was to investigate the [[Sky Temple of Karsol]], a ruin which Solo thought could either have Jedi origins or contain information on Abeloth. Fel reluctantly acquiesced after she promised him they'd spend the rest of their honeymoon on Hapes after a few days on Sakuub. They arrived at Sakuub and the married couple met up with their local guide, [[Pharika]], in the local market using assumed names. Solo sensed trouble but not immediate danger, so she continued onward. A glimpse of a Hutt trying to avoid being seen also disturbed her, but she and Fel tried to enjoy Pharika's tour of the market. They spent the evening in a hotel that Solo had arranged after checking it for listening devices.<ref name=\"Getaway\">{{InsiderCite|134|Getaway}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jaina_Sakuub.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina on Sakuub]]\nThe next day, they departed on their four-day hiking trip into the mountains to see the Sky Temple, enjoying the scenery along the way. On the third day, they caught sight of the temple and reached it on their fourth day. Solo felt a strong concentration of Force energy from the temple, which led her to discover a Jedi holocron. At that point, Pharika turned on them, pointing a blaster at them, and revealing that she knew their true identities. Solo was nonplussed even as Pharika was reinforced by a small transatmospheric ship. Pharika fired at Fel's leg, wounding him, but Solo threw the holocron to him and attacked Pharika even as the ship opened fire on her. She struck the ship a glancing blow with a levitated chunk of rock, which bought her time to deflect one of Pharika's blasts into her leg. Fel broke from cover and subdued Pharika, but the ship disintegrated her rather than risk her revealing information to them. The marauding ship then tried to bury them under rubble by blasting ruins and a piece of debris grazed her shoulder. However, a second ship arrived, destroyed their attacker, and then landed to reveal a Hutt. Upon her inquiry, the Hutt revealed that he had intervened on their behalf to repay the debt incurred when Solo and Calrissian had upheld the Treaty of Vontor. Solo was grateful to the Hutt, who informed them that the debt was paid and left. Solo treated Fel's injury and he pointed out that he couldn't climb all the way down. Solo was undeterred and began jumping down the steep slopes that led up to the Sky Temple, then stopping to levitate Fel down from boulder to boulder.<ref name=\"Getaway\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Jaina does have a gift for making people nervous. She takes after her father that way.|Leia Solo on her daughter|Fate of the Jedi: Abyss}}\nJaina Solo was a Human female standing 1.49 meters high as an adult and had [[Color/Legends|brown]] eyes, dark brown [[Hair/Legends|hair]], and fair skin.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> She was known for being more like her father than her other siblings, exhibiting an aptitude for mechanics and piloting,<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" /> as well as demonstrating some of Han's more impulsive and stubborn characteristics.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" /> Solo had difficulties understanding the emotional distance between her and her mother as she grew up. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Solo discovered she had more attributes with her mother than she first thought, resulting in a much closer mother and daughter bond.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" /> As Solo became older, many noted she could act like Leia in an instant.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" /> She was especially close to her twin brother Jacen, as they shared a bond in the Force similar to the one between her uncle and mother.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> She was easily frustrated, but was good at thinking on her feet, and dedicated to finishing whatever she started.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\n[[File:ElvisSolo.jpg|thumb|left|Jaina Solo with her siblings]]\nBy the time of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Solo was both skilled in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and an excellent pilot. In the early stages, she was criticized by Jagged Fel for not being \"grim\" or mature enough to handle war, which rankled with her.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" /> However, losing friends and family during the war hardened her, and in her grief and anger following the loss of her brother, she was nearly consumed by her emotions as she sought revenge on the Yuuzhan Vong by any means.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> Although she was redeemed from fully falling to the dark side, she continued to fight against the invaders vehemently, to the extent that her uncle named her the \"Sword of the Jedi\" in her knighting ceremony. Her lightsaber technique was described by her brother as cool and measured, never wasting any unnecessary effort.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" /> Solo was known for taking bold actions, often going farther in her prosecution of the war than the \"official\" Jedi position, and sometimes strayed from more orthodox [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] doctrines, though not as far as Kyp Durron. Throughout the war, she was known for being a hard worker dedicated to the cause, and for pushing those around her to excel as well. Leia admitted Solo inherited her own work ethic. Inside, the losses of comrades affected her, and she confided that she expected to die in the war. Her armored exterior and purposeful distancing from others around her served to disguise the numerous emotional hurts, grief, and scars she bore.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\nJaina Solo's personality was further changed by the Joining process she experienced in the Dark Nest Crisis and subsequent Swarm War. She temporarily lost her individuality, sharing the thoughts of the other Jedi Joiners and the Killik hives. She lost some portion of her individual will to the collective mind of the Killiks, dominated by Raynar Thul, but was eventually un-Joined and regained her full personality.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" /><ref name=\"Dark Nest II: The Unseen Queen\" /><ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" /> At the start of the Second Galactic Civil War, Solo became increasingly worried, fearful, and resentful of her twin, a marked change from their childhood days of comradeship. She was particularly annoyed over his instant promotion to colonel, a rank she worked years to achieve.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\nThe continued losses of family, friends and comrades took their toll on Solo, despite the joys she experienced in the company of her family and close friends such as Kyp Durron, Jagged Fel, and Zekk.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> She was as determined as ever in order to complete her missions, whether that be hunting down renegade Dark Jedi Alema Rar<ref name=\"Exile\" /> or training for a fight against Caedus. At one point, she pushed herself to the point where Jagged Fel thought she was overdoing her preparations, wearing herself out.<ref name=\"Fury\" /> Still, Solo saw herself as the Sword of the Jedi, a lone warrior and the avatar of the Jedi Order, which caused her to maintain an intense workload and keep herself from too many close relationships.<ref name=\"Exile\" /><ref name=\"Inferno\" /> By the latter stages of the Second Galactic Civil War, Solo was determined to set herself against her brother, who now styled himself Darth Caedus. Though she was reluctant to admit it, she eventually came to realize that the Jacen she had known was dead.<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> While she valued the company of her friends, family, and comrades, Solo felt she had to deal with Caedus herself, going so far as to seek out her father's nemesis Boba Fett for training in how to defeat the Sith Lord.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina_Solo_bishoujo_art.jpg|thumb|right|upright|150px|Jaina Solo was skilled at both piloting and the Force.]]\nHer brief period of time with the Mandalorians taught her to be relentless in her pursuit of her brother, though she refused to fully acquiesce to Fett's view that compassion and other emotions were weakness. As willful and headstrong as always, Jaina presented a plan to the Masters' Council for her to challenge Caedus alone, but she was willing to accept their judgment no matter what. She knew that the only way she could defeat Caedus properly was for her mission to be a sanctioned one against a threat to the galaxy, not out of personal vengeance. Solo ultimately confronted and slew the Sith Lord her brother had become, but she still felt his loss keenly. Having to kill Jacen not only resulted in substantial physical injury for Solo, but also emotional and psychological trauma from slaying her twin. In the days that followed, she looked to her surviving family and friends for comfort, though several of her comrades had been injured or killed during the war.<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> Solo was willing to sacrifice herself for the sake of stopping the dark side entity Abeloth. She also remained pragmatic and focused in combat, telling Ben Skywalker the importance of duty even over rescuing a loved one. However, internally Solo knew that she would attempt something reckless if it had been Fel who was in danger or captured.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nSolo was known to bury herself in starship, machinery, or droid modifications or repair in times of trial. After the mission to Myrkr, she spent much of her time working on modifications to her stolen Yuuzhan Vong frigate.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> Following her break-up with Fel in 43 ABY, Solo turned to her mechanical predilections as a distraction from her emotional turmoil. In one diversion, she added a new humor routine to her [[R9-series astromech droid|R9]], [[Rowdy]], though she later decided that it left much to be desired, considering it reminiscent of Jacen's \"lame\" childhood jokes.<ref name=\"Vortex\" /> Her relationship with Jagged Fel was alternately a source of solace and consternation for her, as Solo also had a deep commitment to the Jedi Order that sometimes clashed with her love for Fel.<ref name=\"Omen\" /><ref name=\"Ascension\" /><ref name=\"Allies\" /> This became easier once Fel abdicated rule of the Empire and they were married shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nAs an adult, Jaina Solo was known for her steadfast loyalty to the Jedi Order, as well as a pragmatic and straightforward approach to problems.<ref name=\"Allies\" /> She had no problems with circumventing rules she saw as interfering with her true duty.<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> She was also known for having a considerable temper,<ref name=\"Omen\" /> but was generally reserved about discussing her family or romantic relationships in public.<ref name=\"Vortex\" /> Though Solo was known for speaking her mind, she could also endure difficulty without grumbling, particularly when the greater good of her actions was explained. In private, among her friends and loved ones, she was less reserved about voicing her opinion.<ref name=\"Omen\" /><ref name=\"Abyss\" /> As Solo deeply cared about both her friends and family and her commitment to the Jedi Order, her most severe internal conflicts were when she was forced to choose between the two.<ref name=\"Abyss\" /><ref name=\"Allies\" /><ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\" />\n\n===Relationships===\n====Zekk====\n{{Quote|Zekk, sometimes you're a real pain in the neck.

They shared many adventures together, becoming fast friends in the process.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest\" /> Solo often found her thoughts dwelling on Zekk, especially after he was inducted into the Shadow Academy.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones\" /> It was because of their growing friendship that Solo was able to redeem Zekk from the dark side. As they continued to see each other, the two developed a mutual attraction, though neither would admit their true feelings.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef \" /> Despite their close bond with one another, Zekk couldn't stop her from her dark side leanings after the Mission to Myrkr, where Solo lost both her brothers.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> They parted ways soon after, reuniting during the Dark Nest Crisis. However, by this time, Solo's feelings for Zekk had turned into something purely platonic, making it impossible for her to accept a relationship between them. The harder Zekk tried to make her fall in love with him, the more Solo insisted that she would never be in a relationship with him.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nWhen they became Joiners, Solo and Zekk felt each other's emotions and heard each other's thoughts. Despite this, Solo still refused to pursue Zekk, wishing that her relationship with Jagged Fel had not fallen apart.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" /> During the Second Galactic Civil War, Solo and Zekk were never apart, working together on various missions. Solo's family began to suspect that Solo and Zekk were a couple, though both denied their relationship was more than a friendly one. After Zekk admitted to Solo that he was over her, Solo was relieved. However, a series of events made Solo reconsider their romance.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Both Solo and Zekk still insisted that they were just friends, though her family believed that something had changed between the two.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /><ref name=\"Tempest\" /> During a mission to catch Rar, Zekk and Solo were forced to work with Jagged Fel. Despite Solo's changed attitude towards Zekk, Fel's presence stirred old feelings, though she was attracted to them both.<ref name=\"Exile\" /><ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\nAfter sustaining a head wound in a lightsaber duel with Darth Caedus, Solo was extracted back to a blastboat in a delirious state. In this fashion, she stated that she wanted to share quarters with Zekk and Fel, though she did not recall this statement later. Shortly before her final duel with Caedus, during an attack run against the ''Anakin Solo'', Solo felt Zekk simply vanish in the Force as his ship was destroyed. She did not believe Zekk was dead because there was no sort of last reaction from him in the Force, but afterward she was disappointed to learn that Zekk still had yet to be found.<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> Zekk was later found to be alive and re-emerged sometime afterward, but by that time he was involved with a Hapan woman named [[Taryn Zel]] and working on other assignments.<ref name=\"Backlash\" /> When Solo received word that Zekk and Taryn were engaged, she was happy for her old friend.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\n====Kyp Durron====\n{{Quote|You have a relationship with me.

After their initial encounter, Solo felt something stir in her, as she felt Fel was in every way her equal.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" /> While working together, the two developed feelings for one another. Though their relationship was often interrupted by their duties, Solo and Fel found ways to communicate with each other. Solo first confessed her feelings to him after disobeying direct orders in order to save his life during a battle against the Yuuzhan Vong. Afterward, Fel confronted her, asking her why she had saved him, and she told him that she didn't want him to leave her life like others had. At that point, he kissed her and they began seeing each other more often thereafter.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" /> However, during the latter part of the war, Solo's preoccupation with her mission led to her messages to Fel being more ambivalent, which incited Fel to sneak into her quarters and kiss her unexpectedly to see if she was still attracted to him. She enjoyed the kiss for a moment before shoving him away from her, which he considered a rekindling of their relationship.<ref name=\"Ylesia\" />\n\n[[File:Jaina_Jag_firstkiss.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Jagged Fel and Jaina Solo share their first kiss on Borleias.]]\nPart of Solo's willingness to accompany her parent's diplomatic mission following the Battle of Ebaq 9 was due to Fel's accompanying the mission and he provided emotional support for her.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" /> When she was comatose for a prolonged period in an attempt to aid Tahiri Veila, Fel stayed by her bedside, telling her that he loved her and wanted her to return.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" /> The war eventually strained their relationship, as Solo declined his offer to return to [[Csilla/Legends|Csilla]] with him as she felt her duty came before her own personal needs. She also realized that the lingering effects of the Jedi meld that the Myrkr strike team had employed had left her emotionally detached from others, including Fel, and they failed to reconnect when they met again shortly after the Yuuzhan Vong War.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" /> The two met again during the Swarm War, where Fel was leading Chiss forces against the Killik nests on Tenupe, and Solo initially professed that she was over him, despite her lingering feelings for Fel. Before Leia shot him down, Solo confessed that she would always love him.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" />\n\nBy the Second Galactic Civil War, Solo had convinced herself that she was not in love with Fel anymore, and even considered that maybe she wasn't meant to be loved. After reuniting with Fel on Coruscant, Solo and Fel's rocky relationship grew more tense, as Fel revealed to both Solo and Zekk that he was jealous of the latter. This complication led to a growing rivalry between Fel and Zekk to gain attention from Solo.<ref name=\"Exile\" /><ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> Solo would later vocalize a wish to share quarters with both Zekk and Jag after being extracted from a lightsaber duel against Caedus. As she had suffered a head injury in the duel, she was delirious and did not later recall making that statement. Later, after her final duel with Caedus, she was glad that Fel had been the first one to reach her and help her back to a friendly ship.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nIn the years after the Second Galactic Civil War, Solo and Fel continued to develop their relationship, with Fel even professing that Solo was the woman he loved, though their relationship was kept somewhat secret because of Fel's new position as the head of the Imperial Remnant and their fear of angering the Moffs.<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> By 43 ABY, though, the attraction between the two was common knowledge. That same year, Jagged Fel asked Jaina Solo to marry him.<ref name=\"Omen\" /> Their relationship did come with the added stress of dividing her loyalties. When Fel gave her confidential knowledge pertaining to the Jedi Order and the Galactic Alliance, Solo had to keep that from the Jedi Council, despite her wish to do otherwise, since she had given her word to keep that secret. When word of this eventually reached the Council, they barred Fel from the Jedi Temple and suggested she re-evaluate her priorities. Solo persisted in her engagement with Fel nonetheless.<ref name=\"Abyss\" />\n\nHowever, after their duties continued to conflict and a Mandalorian siege and the Lost Tribe of Sith threatened the Order, Solo decided that their relationship would not work. She returned her engagement ring to a stunned Fel and took off to aid her uncle against the Sith.<ref name=\"Allies\" /> However, Fel did not believe that her reasons were strong enough to break off their marriage. After warning the Solos about Daala's plans, he reconciled with Solo, and she wore her engagement ring again, though she and Fel believed that it was a temporary reconciliation and that they would take the time to discuss their issues.<ref name=\"Vortex\" /> One of their resolutions was to accept their mutual needs to keep secrets from each other due to their occupations, and to not grow angry when that was necessary. Solo also chided Fel for taking a vocally pro-Jedi stance in response to the Jedi coup, but he told her that he only needed to do so in order to do his job.<ref name=\"Conviction\" /> When Luke Skywalker revealed that he was removing the Jedi Order from Coruscant, Solo was once again torn between her desire to be with Fel and her duty to the Jedi Order. Fel was understanding, though, accepting that she wanted to be with the Jedi and telling her to follow her wishes&mdash;he assured her that their relationship would survive.<ref name=\"Ascension\" /> After the defeat of Abeloth and the Lost Tribe of Sith, along with the removal of Daala from power, Fel abdicated rule of the Empire. He and Solo were married on the Hapan flagship ''Dragon Queen II'' as the Jedi Order prepared to relocate to Shedu Maad.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|That kid can fly.|Han Solo, referring to Jaina|The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime}}\n[[File:Second_Battle_of_Roche.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaina while dueling her brother during the [[Second Battle of Roche]].]]\nAs heir to the Skywalker bloodline through her mother, Solo was strong in the Force. She was particularly gifted with mechanical devices, though not on the level of her younger brother Anakin.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> Jaina's great Force potential was developed and harnessed throughout her life. Even as a child, Solo exhibited talent with the Force, instinctively using it to power telekinesis during their captivity by the [[Empire Reborn]] to irritate their captors. She also used the Force to help her and Jacen eventually escape imprisonment and was capable of producing light by rubbing air molecules together telekinetically.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\" /> At some point, she learned Force lightning<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> and could break the grip of a Force choke.<ref name=\"Revelation\" /> Solo also knew how to use projectile firearms, at one point employing a sniper rifle against her Sith brother.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\nAs a teenager, Solo received training at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum, where she was trained in the ways of the Jedi,<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> including how to construct and use a lightsaber.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers\" /> Her closest friend was her brother Jacen Solo and the two developed a twin bond that linked them together closely. Solo was also a skilled mechanic and pilot, having learned from her father and Chewbacca in her youth. Even as a teenager, Solo was skilled enough to install a hyperdrive in a starfighter.<ref name=\"Heirs of the Force\" /> By the start of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Solo was already an experienced warrior, having fought both in space<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Return to Ord Mantell\" /> and on the ground.<ref name=\"The Apprentice\" /> At the age of sixteen, Solo flew a record time course through the asteroid field Lando's Folly near Dubrillion, beating out the record previously held by Jedi Master Kyp Durron.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" /> Solo was skilled enough to join Rogue Squadron at a young age<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" /> and flew numerous missions throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War against the alien invaders, scoring countless kills.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> Solo continued to fly in the Second Galactic Civil War, at first as part of the Galactic Alliance over Corellia<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> and later as a Jedi at the Battle of Centerpoint Station, among other engagements.<ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Inferno\" /> During the fight against the Lost Tribe of the Sith, Solo was able to successfully fend off a Sith meditation sphere on multiple occasions<ref name=\"Allies\" /><ref name=\"Apocalypse\" /> and a fleet of Sith pirates in another with minimal assistance aside from her StealthX.<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\nShe was trained in the use of a Jedi [[Force healing/Legends|healing trance]], which she employed on the mission to Myrkr to help heal the [[Torture/Legends|torture]] she suffered during a brief period of Yuuzhan Vong captivity.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> During her tutelage under Kyp Durron, Solo learned how to erase and alter memories from her master, which she learned while in the Hapes Cluster.<ref name=\"The Apprentice\" /> On one occasion, Solo joined minds with a comatose Tahiri Veila to help her unite her fragmented personality.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" /> Solo was a skilled enough lightsaber combatant to personally slay Yuuzhan Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah even with her legs pinioned<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" /> and she stood her own against Supreme Overlord Shimrra's slayer bodyguards in the final battle of the Yuuzhan Vong war.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" /> While dueling her brother for the first time, he described her fighting style as conservative, brutal, ruthless, designed to deal damage without suffering any in return.<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> Her considerable skill with a lightsaber was such that in 40 ABY, she was able to slay her twin brother<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> and in 43 ABY, she was able to defeat four Mandalorian warriors attacking the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Backlash\" /> Solo was comfortable fighting both in teams or by herself. In an example of the former, she and several other Jedi and their allies broke into a high-security Galactic Alliance prison in 43 ABY. They retrieved the two prisoners they had come for and escaped with minimal casualties on either side, as Solo had no difficulty in deflecting blaster fire from multiple assailants while lobbing stun grenades in return.<ref name=\"Vortex\" /> While on Dromund Kaas, Solo fought and killed three Sith assailants from the Lost Tribe of the Sith without sustaining serious injury to herself.<ref name=\"Ascension\" /> She later slew multiple Sith on Coruscant during the Lost Tribe of Sith resurgence, often despite severe injuries.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\n[[File:JainaMechanic.jpg|thumb|right|Jaina tends to the repairs of her ship.]]\nAlso, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, she and her brothers were able to re-create the Jedi battle meld,<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" /> focusing a unit of Jedi together into one cohesive group. This ability was vital to the mission to Myrkr<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> and was also used in several other battles as the Solo twins taught other Jedi the ability.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" /><ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" /> Another Force technique which Solo had at her disposal was telekinesis.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" /><ref name=\"Invincible\" /> Solo could also use the Force to control her breathing<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> and clear toxins from her body<ref name=\"Inferno\" /> and was adept in the use of the [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]].<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nSolo also learned infiltration techniques, allowing her to evade pursuers on several occasions.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" /><ref name=\"Omen\" /> Her use of deception during the Yuuzhan Vong War sowed considerable consternation into the ranks of the Yuuzhan Vong, such as when she employed gravitic beacons to cause Yuuzhan Vong ships to fire on each other.<ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /><ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\" /> While imitating a Yuuzhan Vong goddess, Solo learned psychological warfare from Wraith Squadron and was able to employ it to good effect in order to direct Yuuzhan Vong war efforts; her capture was considered a strategic objective of the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\" /> She also learned to wipe memories during the Yuuzhan Vong War from Kyp Durron.<ref name=\"The Apprentice\" />\n\nDuring the Dark Nest Crisis and the Swarm War, Solo and Zekk became Joiners, allowing them to share in the Killik hive mind. Her particular talents were more in the way of [[Starfighter combat/Legends|starfighter combat]], though she also participated in ground battles.<ref name=\"Dark Nest I: The Joiner King\" /><ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" /> Though she was eventually unjoined, Solo would retain some of the shared-mind bond with Zekk for some time afterward.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Solo retained her capabilities as a warrior into the Second Galactic Civil War and her own intense training,<ref name=\"Fury\" /> combined with a short period of tutelage under Mandalorian commandos, only served to hone the edge of the Sword of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Revelation\" /> Though she felt she wasn't the equal of Jacen in terms of Force powers due to his prolonged study, she thought she could surprise him, and proved herself able to match even his impressive skills when the time came. Also during the war, Solo learned the [[Shatterpoint/Legends|shatterpoint]] technique from Luke Skywalker, which she had long thought lost. She also learned how to shut down in the Force, so as to be undetectable, from her cousin Ben.<ref name=\"Invincible\" /> Later, Solo demonstrated an affinity for the [[Animal bond|Beast Control]] power, being able to bend a large number of different animals to her will at the same time.<ref name=\"Omen\" /> However, despite her skill as a Jedi Knight, pilot, and combatant, Solo had yet to develop the use of her womanly charms for persuasion; her mother, at age sixty, was better at such subtleties than Jaina Solo was, to the astonishment of the younger Solo.<ref name=\"Invincible\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n===Origins and development===\n{{Quote|I mean, a sister killing her brother&ndash;not such an easy thing to do.|Sue Rostoni|url=http://www.eucantina.net/interviews/sue-rostoni2}}\n[[File:Jainafigure.jpg|thumb|left|The Jaina Solo action figure]]\nJaina Solo was created by author [[Timothy Zahn]], and first appeared in his [[1993]] novel ''[[The Last Command]]'' when her mother, having been pregnant with Jaina and Jacen throughout the previous two novels of Zahn's [[Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy|trilogy]], gave birth to the twins on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Last Command\" /><ref name=\"htte\">''[[Heir to the Empire]]''</ref><ref name=\"dfr\">''[[Dark Force Rising]]''</ref> Zahn had difficulty naming the character, eventually settling on \"Jaina\" after having already named Jacen<ref name=\"DB\" /> after a friend of his son's<ref name=\"From Heir to Last Command\">{{Journal|1|From Heir to Last Command}}</ref> and wanting the twins' names to be alliterative like Luke and Leia's. Throughout the first ten years of the characters' [[in-universe]] lives, the three Solo children played both minor and supporting roles in various novels, but the Solo twins took center stage in the fourteen-book young adult series [[Star Wars: Young Jedi Knights|''Young Jedi Knights'']], beginning with [[1995]]'s [[Young Jedi Knights: Heirs of the Force|''Heirs of the Force'']]. The series chronicled the twins' adventures as students at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\nWhen representatives from [[Lucas Licensing]] and [[Del Rey]] books were planning out the nineteen-book [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|''The New Jedi Order'']] series, they made the decision to develop a new generation of characters in tandem with the heroes of the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies.<ref name=\"Shapiro interview\">{{SWArchive|url=eu/lit/novel/f20001224/index.html|text=Telling War Stories: An Interview with Shelly Shapiro|archivedate=20110905154801}}</ref> Solo and her brothers thus became principal protagonists of the series, which ran from [[1999]] to [[2003]]. Still a teenager, Solo was on the front lines of the Yuuzhan Vong War as a Jedi Knight and a pilot with Rogue Squadron, and was the star of the novel ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'', which told of her brush with the dark side of the Force and development into a full Jedi Knight.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /><ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" /><ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" /> Following the conclusion of ''The New Jedi Order'', Solo played a major role in the latter half of the nine-book ''[[Star Wars: Legacy of the Force]]'' series that ran from [[2006]] to [[2008]], a series that saw her brother Jacen become a Sith Lord and concluded with his death at Solo's hands.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /><ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Inferno\" /><ref name=\"Revelation\" /><ref name=\"Invincible\" /> When discussing how the series would end, the ''Legacy of the Force'' planning team considered redeeming Jacen's character, but, influenced by the desire to see Solo fulfill the prophecy which named her the Sword of the Jedi, ultimately decided that she would kill him.<ref name=\"Rostoni interview\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.eucantina.net/interviews/sue-rostoni2|title=Interview with Sue Rostoni|date=2009-01-30|publisher=EUCantina.net|archivedate=20170714103742}}</ref> In the time since the conclusion of ''Legacy of the Force'', Solo has played a large role in its followup series, [[Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi|''Fate of the Jedi'']],<ref name=\"Outcast\" /><ref name=\"Omen\" /><ref name=\"Abyss\" /><ref name=\"Allies\" /><ref name=\"Ascension\" /> which culminated in her marriage to Jagged Fel.<ref name=\"Apocalypse\" />\n\nIn [[2009]], a 3 \u00be inch action figure of Jaina Solo was released by [[Hasbro Inc.|Hasbro]] as part of its [[Star Wars: The Legacy Collection|Legacy Collection]].
