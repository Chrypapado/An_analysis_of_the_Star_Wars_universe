You know all the odds! There's no beating you, my man!|Lando Calrissian|Lando 5}}\n'''Lobot''', also known by the nickname '''Lo''', was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] from the [[planet]] [[Bespin]] who, with the assistance of his [[AJ^6 cyborg construct]], was paid to run battlefield calculations for the [[Galactic Empire]]. However, he eventually began working with the [[smuggler]] [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', running numerous criminal jobs. During one job, the [[Theft of the Imperialis|theft]] of [[Darth Sidious|the Emperor's]] personal [[yacht]], Lobot was gravely wounded by an [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Guard]]. In his injured state, Lobot's mind was lost and his cybernetic implants took over.\n\nIn the [[time]] to come, Calrissian became [[Baron Administrator]] of [[Cloud City]] on Lobot's homeworld of Bespin, and Lobot served as his [[aide]] and chef. As the [[city]]'s [[computer]]-liaison officer, his implants enabled him to communicate with the city's central network. During the Empire's takeover of Cloud City, Lando ordered Lobot to gather their security forces to outflank the [[stormtrooper]]s. Although they successfully helped evacuate the city by rounding up the stormtroopers, the city soon fell to the Empire and Lobot was captured.\n\nFollowing the Empire's defeat at the [[Battle of Endor]], Imperial [[Governor]] [[Ubrik Adelhard]] tightened his grip on the [[Anoat sector]], home to Bespin, forming the [[Iron Blockade]]. Receiving support from the [[New Republic]], Lobot fought to [[Liberation of Cloud City|liberate]] his homeworld.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early careers===\n{{Quote|You had the Imperials put those ''things'' in your head so you could get paid to run battlefield calculations, all nice and safe back at a ''base''.|Lando Calrissian, to Lobot|Lando 1}}\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War]] between the [[Galactic Empire]] and [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], Lobot, a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] from [[Bespin]],<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> was hired by the Empire to run battlefield calculations.

Calrissian, in order to pay off the debt, went to steal a valuable object from the Imperial [[governor]] of the [[sector]]: [[Moff]] [[Ssaria]], known as the \"Fiend of Castell\" and the \"Burning Moff.\" However, instead of just stealing the trinket and running, Calrissian suavely manipulated the Moff into giving it to him; Calrissian soon told the story to Lobot when they met in [[Toren's cantina]]. Lobot was shocked at the risks his partner took, adding that his implants gleaned that the odds of that working were about one in ten thousand. The gambler replied that he didn't like to know the odds, and explained that he had done what he did because he didn't want the Moff hunting them. Lobot was assured by his partner that they were debt free after he traded the trinket to Toren, and Lando then went to speak with the crime boss. He returned a few minutes later with news: ten percent of their debt had been wiped away, and he had a chance at one \"hell of a score.\" Lobot was appalled that only ten percent of their debt had been cleared and demanded to know what had gone wrong. Calrissian explained that things had not gone as planned, but still had gone well, given the new job. Lobot, however, did not share Calrissian's optimism and believed they should fight Toren. Calrissian did not, adding that Lobot had the cyborg construct implanted so he wouldn't have to fight, just analyze battlefront movements from afar. Lobot gave in, so they began preparations for the job.<ref name=\"Lando 1\" />\n\nThe duo first recruited the [[Cloning|cloned]] [[hand-to-hand combat]] experts [[Aleksin]] and [[Pavol]] in case they did need to fight, and next, the [[Ugnaught]] antiquities expert, [[Sava]] [[Korin Pers]], whom they met in her office. Pers pulled a blaster on Calrissian when he entered; the last time they had worked together, Pers lost an [[eye]]. Pers eventually agreed to assist in the job after seeing the ease and the payoff. Soon, the team of five made their way to [[Sienar Fleet Systems]] [[Orbital Shipyard CC-24]] in [[orbit]] over Castell, which the team infiltrated using [[stealth suit]]s. They quickly secured a portion of the [[shipyard]], [[Theft of the Imperialis|hijacked]] an Imperial [[Yacht|pleasure craft]] that they believed had belonged to an Imperial art collector, and blasted away from the station. Calrissian [[pilot]]ed the [[Starship|ship]], the ''[[Imperialis]]'', while Lobot acted as his co-pilot.

Lobot grew frustrated as the \"easy score\" that Calrissian had promised began to disappear. Calrissian argued that it was a good thing that the [[Star Destroyer]]s arrived; it meant the ship was incredibly valuable to its owner&mdash;who, unknown to Lobot and his fellows, was none other than [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. The Star Destroyers dropped [[gravity]]-based mines to prevent the ''Imperialis'' from entering hyperspace, but the yacht's automated defenses destroyed the mines. When the Star Destroyers captained by Shan and Conro activated tractor beams to reclaim the vessel, Lando had Lobot upload the ships' coordinates to Lando's piloting [[computer]]. With the coordinates uploaded, Lando piloted the ''Imperialis'' between the two Star Destroyers, causing them to lock onto each other. Unable to disengage in time, the [[capital ship]]s collided, giving the ''Imperialis'' the opportunity to jump to hyperspace. Free from the [[Castell system]], Lando and Lobot were approached by Sava Korin, who said the yacht was filled with treasure. Touring the crew around, Korin explained that one area of the ship, the central chamber, was very well secured, so Lobot volunteered to open the sealed door with his implants. When he did, however, he was confronted by a pair of [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Guards]], one of which immediately impaled him through the chest with their [[Force pike|staff]].<ref name=\"Lando 2\" />\n\n====A turn for the worse====\n{{Quote|What's ''wrong'' with him, Calrissian?''\"<br />\"''When Lobot loses ''focus'', his implants start to take over his ''mind'', Korin.

Lobot, struggling to maintain consciousness, fought against his implants from taking over his mind. Pers, informing Lando of a medical bay one deck from their location, helped Lando rush Lobot to a [[bacta tank]]. Not sure if the semi-conscious Lobot reached the [[bacta]] tank in time, Lando apologized to his friend. Pers, deducing the ''Imperialis'' belonged to Palpatine, told Lando that the entire crew would die. Lando, unable to withstand the recent events, went to check on the [[twin]]s.<ref name=\"Lando 3\">[[Lando 3|''Lando'' 3]]</ref>\n\nAleksin and Pavol defeated the Guards, so the crew examined the central chambers artifacts. Pers, attributing the pieces to be works by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Momin]], an ancient [[Sith]] sculptor, estimating the artifacts to each be worth an entire [[moon]] or two. While Calrissian and Pers discussed the loot, Aleksin became possessed by a [[Armor|helmet]] imbued with the [[dark side of the Force]], igniting a [[double-bladed lightsaber]] and attacking Pavol. Shocked, Calrissian and Pers fled the chamber, resealing the door behind them. Pers argued to enter the [[escape pod]]s, but Lando refused to leave Lobot behind. Meanwhile, unknown to Lando and Pers, Chanath Cha, now working for the Emperor, had infiltrated the ship. Preventing the crew's escape, Cha disabled the pods, and the ship relayed the message over the intercom. Lando realized that someone else must be on the ship, and, soon after, Pers and Lando encountered the bounty hunter at gunpoint. However, Cha recognized Lando and lowered her weapons. Cha explained her presence, saying that she was sent to [[Death|kill]] anyone aboard or destroy the vessel.<ref name=\"Lando 4\">[[Lando 4|''Lando'' 4]]</ref>\n\n====A change of plans====\n{{Quote|Can't&hellip;stop the auto-destruct.

However, when Calrissian told Cha that Lobot was aboard the ''Imperialis'' and was injured, Cha succumbed to Calrissian's plan of stopping Aleksin and Pavol and keeping the ship intact. Immediately after, Aleksin and Pavol confronted the group, saying that Pers was a victim, before killing her. Sealing the door between them and the twins, Cha went to dock the ''Scimitar'' while Calrissian went to retrieve Lobot. Despite Lobot needing more time, Calrissian removed him from the bacta as the ship announced it would self-destruct. Helping Lobot out of the medical bay, Calrissian encountered Aleksin, fatally shooting the [[alien]]. The two reunited with Cha, and Lobot told her that he'd missed her company. When Lando asked if the ''Scimitar'' was prepped, Cha explained that her ship's [[droid]] pilot, [[O-66]], had fled, trapping them on the self-destructing ''Imperialis''. Lobot then requested to be taken to a computer interface, where he attempted to disable the auto-destruct. Unable to do so, Lobot realized he could turn the escape pods back on, but he couldn't do so while fighting his implant from taking over. Deciding to save his longtime friends, he enabled the pods, allowing the implants to take over his mind. Moving to the escape pods, Lando invited Cha to come with them, saying that it might bring Lobot back, but Cha declined, saying that he'd made his choice and picked Lando. After Cha said goodbye, Lando and Lobot's pod ejected. As it departed, Lando told Lobot he'd find a cure to bring him back. Upon hearing the word \"cure,\" Lobot's cybernetic construct played a pre-recorded contingency message to his friend, saying that Lobot believed Lando could find a cure, but either way he wouldn't be upset, as he had lived by his choices. Lobot's message went on to tell Lando that people trust his leadership, and that he needed to do something good with that power. Lobot's recording then ended with, \"Lando. Old buddy.

Unknown to Solo and his companions, Calrissian had already made a secret agreement with [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to hand Solo over to the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], who was working for the [[Hutt]] crime lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]]. While the Empire agreed not to arrest Solo's rebel companions, they would not be allowed to leave Cloud City.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nAround that time, Lobot oversaw the arrival of the [[smuggler]] [[Jaxxon]] on Cloud City. Jaxxon was tardy, a result of his droid mis-scheduling his appointment and, although Lobot failed to recognize him, claimed to be an old friend of Calrissian's. Lobot voiced his skepticism of Calrissian being able to fit Jaxxon into an already busy schedule, but the [[Lepi]] persisted, earning himself an audience with the Baron Administrator.<ref name=\"Fake It Till You Make It\">{{Shortstory|story=Fake It Till You Make It|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\nLater, Lobot was present when Vader, Fett, and several Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s apprehended Solo and his companions at a banquet hall. After the Imperials froze Solo in [[carbonite]] and handed him over to Fett, Darth Vader altered the terms of the deal by arresting Organa, Chewbacca, and C-3PO.

When Lando remarked that the Empire had left Cloud City in a mess, Lando responded that he would look into rehiring staff immediately. Lando then told Lobot to make sure that they hired refugees since Cloud City was inundated with expats and evacuees who needed work. As Lando went to deal with Imperial holdouts in the [[Bolo Tanga room]], Lobot informed Calrissian that his friend Princess Leia Organa was expected to give birth soon and that he had forgotten to send a nuptial gift.

A character serving as Lando Calrissian's assistant was present in most of the original screenplays of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and many production paintings depicted this character as a tall, regal, dark-skinned woman. One of the later drafts of the script established this character as a cyborg, and it was then that actor John Hollis was selected for the role by the filmmakers. The cybernetic implant prop Hollis wore on his head was completely battery-powered and was connected to a spring clip that was fit around the actor's head. However, the prop was quite heavy and uncomfortable to wear.
