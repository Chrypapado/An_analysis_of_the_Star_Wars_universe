At some point during that decade, Korr traveled to [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Rori/Legends|Rori]] to cover the investigation about the kidnapping and [[Death/Legends|murder]] of [[Wernell Covington]]'s daughter, [[Felicia]].<ref name=\"SWG:V\" />\n\nAlmost three decades later,<ref name=\"TQC\" /> by the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Horace Korr had retired to [[Narmle (city)|Narmle]], a [[City/Legends|city]] on Rori.<ref name=\"SWG:V\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> he was contacted by Wernell Covington who was seeking to avenge his daughter. The Covington knew that two of the kidnappers had escaped justice during all those years but he ignored their identity. The reporter agreed with helping the old man, even if he did not completely approve Covington's bloody thirst for revenge. Horace Korr therefore worked with a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] recruited by Covington. The reporter first requested the spacer to visit the ''Corellia Times'' News archive in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]], on Corellia. Korr then tasked the spacer to find his original notes on the crime in an old [[Warehouse (Narmle)|warehouse]] near the [[Narmle Starport]] that was overran by thugs. With those information, Horace Korr was able to identify the last escaped kidnappers: [[Jurgen Nath]] and [[Vladlun Travan]]. The spacer eventually killed them both.<ref name=\"SWG:V\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHorace Korr was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:V\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Horace Korr was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Game Update 12|Game Update 12]]\", on [[August 10]], [[2009]].<ref>{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/posts/list.m?topic_id=976424|text=Game Update 12: Engineering Trader|archivedate=20090816090206}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Vengeance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Korr, Horace}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Journalists]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
