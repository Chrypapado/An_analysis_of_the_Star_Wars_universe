He was always accompanied by his [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]], [[Glongfurrp]].\n\n==Biography==\nToln ne Yerres, a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], was born around [[45 BBY/Legends|45 BBY]]. He started his criminal career as a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] in one of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]]-running operations,<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> working as a [[Courier/Legends|courier]]. It was during this time that he met the [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] [[Glongfurrp]], who was working as an enforcer for operation. Recognizing that the Gamorrean would devote himself to one who could provide him with work, protection, and entertainment, Yerres cultivated a relationship between the two, gaining a loyal [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]].<ref name=\"GG2-2\">[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]</ref> Working in the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]],<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> Yerres soon became the right hand man to the operation's [[Human/Legends|Human]] supervisor. However, when it became clear that the supervisor had no intention of allowing Yerres to ascend higher in Jabba's [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|operation]], Yerres framed him for embezzlement. The new supervisor was more agreeable, and allowed Yerres to move out of the slave operation.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\nYerres soon established a network of contacts, including some on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where Jabba made his base of operations. After ascending a few levels in the organization, he arranged for a transfer to Tatooine to better display his talents and reap greater rewards. Yerres' credentials allowed him to become Jabba's financial manager, a heavily coveted position. However, the Twi'lek saw too many of Jabba's loyal and capable aides fall to his anger, and decided that serving Jabba away from his court would be in his best interest. When Jabba acquired the [[Holiday Towers]] around [[7 BBY/Legends|7 BBY]] from [[Opun Mcgrrrr]] on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], Yerres convinced Jabba to allow him to manage it to ensure it was a profitable venture.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\nOn [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]], Yerres and his constant bodyguard, Glongfurrp, established themselves, along with a cadre of six other Gamorreans. Once, he discovered that a [[Odea Aurora's mother|freighter captain]] was transporting goods stolen from Jabba, and sent Glongfurrp to deal with her.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nToln ne Yerres was a 1.79 [[Imperial standard meter|meter]] tall Twi'lek with a paunch, a result of years of indulgence in Jabba's organization. His [[Lekku/Legends|lekku]] were more of a hindrance to his balance than an aid. Yerres had a flair for management, and the inbred sense shared by Twi'lek's of waiting out a storm.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nYerres was skilled businessman, a shrewd bargainer, and an effective [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucrat]].<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nYerres always carried a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]], and a [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]] for defense.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Gamemaster Toolkit: Live-Action Adventures]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yerres, Toln ne}}\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
