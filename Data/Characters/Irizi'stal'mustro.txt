Zistalmu understood why the Irizi wished to recruit the Commander, but wondered if they had gone mad. Zistalmu knew that Thrawn was a brilliant military strategist, but was also aware of the officer's potential for political embarrassment. Zistalmu offered Thrawn to join the Irizi as a [[Trial-born]], meaning Thrawn would not have to perform the [[Trials]]. Thrawn later asked his friend [[Ar'alani]] for her advice on whether he should accept the offer.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===A Syndic opposing Thrawn===\n{{Quote|Why do you and Syndic Thurfian hate Thrawn so much?\u201d<br/>\u201cFirst, ask the correct question. We ''don\u2019t'' hate Thrawn. Actually, we both admire his military skill. We resist him because he\u2019s a threat to the Ascendancy.\n|Admiral [[Ar'alani]] asking Syndic Zistalmu why he opposed Thrawn so strongly\n|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nMuch like fellow Syndic [[Mitth'urf'ianico|Thurfian]] of the rival Mitth family, Syndic Zistalmu feared that Senior Captain Thrawn could cause lasting damage to the Chiss Ascendancy. He worked with Thurfian to monitor, impede, and eventually try to sabotage Thrawn. Nonetheless, Zistalmu insisted he did not ''hate'' Thrawn, but was wary of the Senior Captain's lack of [[politics|political]] prowess.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nSyndic Zistalmu and [[Nana (Chiss)|his wife]] accompanied Admiral Ar'alani on a [[attack at Primea|rescue mission]] to [[Primea]], the homeworld of the [[Vak]] species, to try to ensure that Thrawn's plan would not blow up in the face of the Ascendancy. Nevertheless, Thrawn would end up temporarily [[thief|stealing]] a [[Thrawn's patrol boat|Vak patrol boat]] with the potential to cause a major diplomatic incident. Ultimately, however, Thrawn and Ar'alani would [[Battle over Primea|liberate Primea]] from the yoke of the [[Nikardun Destiny]] (and return the stolen [[patrol boat]]), more than making up for it.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]''\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0418\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0438'\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b'\u043c\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\n}}\n\n[[Category:Chiss]]\n[[Category:Csillans]]\n[[Category:Irizi family]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Syndics of the Chiss Ascendancy]]"}}}]}}}}
