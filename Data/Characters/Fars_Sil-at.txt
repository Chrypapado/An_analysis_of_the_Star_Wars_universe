He met with various other senior members of the group aboard [[Whiplash Express|a hovertrain]] that served as their interim headquarters, to discuss how the Whiplash would react to the recent capture of their leader, [[Thi Xon Yimmon]], by the Empire. At the suggestion of the [[Sakiyan/Legends|Sakiyan]] [[Tuden Sal]], leadership of the Whiplash passed to the [[Whiplash Council]], and Sil-at served as a member of the council. Under Sal's influence, the Whiplash launched an [[Attack on the Emperor's Villa|ill-fated attack]] on the [[Emperor's Villa]] near the [[Western Sea]], and Sil-at [[Death/Legends|perished]] as a result of the debacle.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Coruscant Nights III: Patterns of Force]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[The Last Jedi (novel)|''The Last Jedi'']] {{1st}} {{1stID}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sil-at, Fars}}\n[[Category:Amanin]]\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Whiplash members]]"}}}]}}}}
