Thooraki invested time in [[Rematching|recruitment]] for the Mitth, seeking out and arranging for invitations to be offered to talented prospective family members.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nPatriarch Thooraki personally asked his friend General [[Ba'kif]] to point the Mitth family to recruit [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Kivu'raw'nuru]], who would later become [[Senior Captain]] Mitth'raw'nuruodo \"Thrawn\" of the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet]]. He also personally made the decision to invite the former ''[[ozyly-esehembo]]'' [[Mitth'ali'astov|Ali'astov]], whose powers of [[precognition|Second Sight]] had faded, into the Mitth.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nPatriarch Thooraki was present when Mitth family [[merit adoptive]] Mitth'ali'astov (\"Thalias\") performed her family [[Trials]]. He considered her solutions to be highly elegant and congratulated her, welcoming her as a [[Trial-born]] of the Mitth. Thooraki considered Trial-born Mitth'raw'nuruodo to be extremely talented and have the potential to bring greatness to the Mitth family and the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] on the whole, but was cognizant that others thought Thrawn might bring them to ruin.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /><ref name=\"Greater Good\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''</ref> He entrusted Thalias to watch over and protect Thrawn from his enemies, as Thrawn was always weak at politics.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I\u2019ve always liked elegance, and your records during your sky-walker years suggested you were of that frame of mind.

Thooraki personally arranged for Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo and Caregiver Mitth'ali'astov to be invited to the Mitth family, seeing their potential to benefit and benefit from the Mitth family.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nPatriarch Thooraki was very protective of Thrawn, knowing the officer was a brilliant tactician and strategist but also aware of Thrawn's fatal flaw of low political acumen. Thooraki correctly surmised that Thrawn had enemies within the upper echelons of not only the Ascendancy, but also the Mitth family itself. Thooraki knew he was old and close to [[death]], and feared that members of the Mitth family who opposed Thrawn may seek to succeed him as Patriarch.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n[[Syndic]] (and later [[Syndic Prime]]) [[Mitth'urf'ianico]] was one such high-ranking anti-Thrawn official of the Mitth.
