What's the chance he's got an Alderaanian conscience inside his Imperial uniform?|[[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]|The Truce at Bakura}}\n'''Conn Doruggan''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]] from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] during the [[Rebellion era]]. He was assigned to the Imperial garrison on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] world of [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]] during the [[Bakura Incident|first]] [[Ssi-ruu]]vi invasion in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]. He had a calm and moderate demeanour which proved helpful during the negotiations leading up to the [[Bakura Truce]] between Imperial and [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance]] delegates.\n\n==Biography==\nAs a boy on Alderaan, Conn Doruggan read [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet's]] accounts of the vicious attacks of bandits beyond the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] boundaries. As a youth, his horror at those acts hardened into a belief that the galaxy needed order above all else, even if the price of maintaining order was giving up basic freedoms. His [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] when he was a cadet at the [[Raithal Academy/Legends|Raithal Military Academy]], but Doruggan remained steadfast in his love for the Empire and his hatred for all who would undermine its rule.\n\nAfter graduation, he served under [[Wilek Nereus]] and became a valued member of his personal staff. On [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]], Captain Doruggan supervised Nereus's efforts to infiltrate resistance cells. During the [[Bakura Incident]], he attended the [[Bakuran Senate]] briefing where representatives from the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] met with Imperial and Bakuran officials. During the meeting, he encountered [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and spoke to her, seemingly without anger at her for being a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Conn Doruggan\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doruggan, Conn}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
