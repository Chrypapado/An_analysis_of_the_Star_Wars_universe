In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], he served under [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Kentor Sarne]] in the [[Kathol sector]] and was appointed as [[Governor/Legends|governor]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kolatill]]. Declaring martial law and [[Prison/Legends|imprisoning]] the local government, the [[Kolatill Council]], Tetrum ordered all [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] manufacturing companies to produce equipment for [[Moff Sarne's forces]]. The Governor ruled the world for eight [[Standard year/Legends|years]], until an uprising staged by the local populace resulted in his own imprisonment. The population of Kolatill had learned of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] successful [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberation]] of the [[Sector/Legends|sector]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]]&mdash;an action that also sent Moff Sarne fleeing deep into the sector&mdash;and had resolved to rid themselves of Imperial rule and declare their allegiance to the new [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government.\n\n==Biography==\nTetrum was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] official who served the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. [[Kentor Sarne]], regional [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] of the [[Kathol sector]], appointed Tetrum as [[Governor/Legends|governor]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kolatill]] in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]]. Moff Sarne had recognized that Kolatill's extensive [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] manufacturing industry would be a valuable asset to his [[Moff Sarne's forces|forces]], and intended to bring the planet under close control. Upon appointment, Tetrum immediately instituted martial law across the planet, and he ordered all repulsorlift manufacturing companies&mdash;with the exception of the [[Politics/Legends|politically]] connected [[Ikas-Adno/Legends|Ikas-Adno]]&mdash;to retool their factories to produce combat [[Speeder/Legends|speeders]] for use by Moff Sarne's forces. He also ordered the arrest and imprisonment of the [[Kolatill Council]], the local ruling body.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\nTetrum ruled the planet for eight [[Standard year/Legends|years]],<ref name=\"O\" /> and remained loyal to Moff Sarne when he withdrew the Kathol [[Sector/Legends|sector]] from Imperial authority<ref name=\"TDC\">''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]''</ref> following the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]<ref name=\"ROTJ\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> and the fracturing of the Empire.<ref name=\"TDC\" /> During Tetrum's time in control of Kolatill, he made use of an extensive network of [[Spy/Legends|spies]] and informants to root out any [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] agents and sympathizers.<ref name=\"O\" /> In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], the New Republic launched a limited campaign against Sarne, [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberating]] the sector [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]] and forcing the Moff to flee into the Kathol sector with the majority of his forces.<ref name=\"TSB\">{{DarkStryder|The Saga Begins|The DarkStryder Campaign}}</ref>\n\nWhen news of the New Republic's victory at Kal'Shebbol reached Kolatill, the population staged an uprising, capturing and imprisoning Tetrum along with his closest supporters. The Kolatill Council was subsequently released to assume control of the planet. However, Tetrum's incarceration triggered a response from Imperial forces still operating in the sector. The [[Ton-Falk-class escort carrier|''Ton-Falk''-class escort carrier]] ''[[Kathol Protector]]'' arrived [[Kolatill system|in-system]] shortly after and launched [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]]. The [[Bombing of Domaz|assault]] destroyed much of the planet's capital city, [[Domaz]], leaving it aflame and in ruins.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTetrum was a loyal servant of the Empire, and willfully followed the orders of immediate superiors. He was disliked by the population of Kolatill due to the Governor's institution of martial law and jailing of the local ruling government.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTetrum was created for the [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] adventure ''[[Omens]]'', which was written by [[Bill Smith]], and was part of ''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]'' published by [[West End Games]] in [[1995]]. Tetrum is never encountered directly in the adventure, and is only referred to.<ref name=\"O\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign}} {{1stm}}\n*{{DarkStryder|Omens|The DarkStryder Campaign, Deluxe}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Governors of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Kolatill residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Moff Sarne's forces]]"}}}]}}}}
