Jix's training helped find him a place as a combat trainer for new recruits. Later, Jix was placed on a mission with [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] in [[8 BBY]]. The mission was the sterilization of [[Falleen (planet)/Legends|Falleen]] and involved the deaths of 200,000 [[Falleen/Legends|Falleen]]. Jix did not perform his duty admirably and was court-martialled and sent to the spice mines of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]]. Jix eventually orchestrated a miraculous escape, after which he fled to the remote world of [[Aridus/Legends|Aridus]] and befriended the local [[Chubbit]]s. Around [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Darth Vader came to Aridus in an effort to capture [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. Vader was being helped by an [[Obi-Wan Kenobi impersonator|impersonator]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. The actor was ordered to lead Skywalker into a trap within the [[Iron Tower]] on Aridus. Unfortunately for Vader, the actor betrayed him and destroyed the tower, killing himself and injuring Vader severely.\n\nJix saw the whole thing play out and went to survey the damage from the tower. There he found Vader unconscious and vulnerable. On Aridus, Jix had come to appreciate the local Chubbits and did not want to see them harmed by an Imperial occupation. He saved Vader's life and brought him back to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. When Vader awoke, Jix struck a deal with the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]], forcing him to promise to leave Aridus and the local Chubbits alone in exchange for Jix's eternal servitude. Vader agreed, and Jix reentered Imperial service as Vader's personal servant.\n\n===Servant of Vader===\nJix quickly proved a capable servant to Vader by exposing a [[Droon|traitor]], whom Vader executed. Jix was later assigned to ensure the survival of Luke Skywalker on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Vader was well aware that Prince [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]] of [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] was attempting to kill Skywalker. Jix traveled to Tatooine with orders to infiltrate [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] gang. Shortly after landing in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], Jix confronted the swoop gang, led by [[Gizman|Big Gizz]] and [[Spiker]].\n\n[[File:JixSwoop-SOTETC.jpg|thumb|left|Jix on a swoop]]\nDespite Jix's tough talk, he was unable to fend off the entire gang once they began beating him with chains and bludgeons until Gizz ordered them to stop. Impressed with his guts, Gizz suggested that Jix race to prove whether he could join the gang. Jix accepted the challenge, and won by shooting his competitor. Again, Big Gizz was impressed and accepted Jix into the gang.\n\nAs a swoop racer, Jix went on to participate in racing championship. On [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], in the preparation for [[Agrilat Swamp Circuit]] race, Jix was approached by an operative sent by [[Lonay]]. The Black Sun [[Vigo/Legends|vigo]] had a personal vendetta against racing star [[Kimmi Chyler]] and attempted to use both Jix and his operative to humiliate her. Jix agreed that Chyler's downfall would help his team and accepted the help. The operative was hired as a mechanic and was to inspect Chyler's swoop for illegal modifications.<ref>{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}</ref> Chyler, however, won the race anyway, and Jix was furious, confronting her and her team after the race.<ref>{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shadow_Syndicate#Card_gallery|cardname=Gang Warfare}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Jabba had received word from Xizor about killing Luke. Jix suggested this would greatly anger Darth Vader, which drew many laughs from the gang. Jabba then sent the gang to kill Luke, who was staying in [[Ben Kenobi's hut]] in the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]]. Earlier in Mos Eisley, Jix had mentioned in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] his affiliation with the Galactic Empire and was overheard by [[Dash Rendar/Legends|Dash Rendar]]. Rendar sped to Luke's aid, but arrived after the gang did.\n\nLuke was nearly overwhelmed by the swoop gang, but held his own aboard a hijacked swoop and led them through [[Beggar's Canyon/Legends|Beggar's Canyon]]. When Spiker got a clear shot at Luke, Jix rammed his swoop into Spiker's to keep Luke alive. Although Jix broke both of his legs in the crash, Spiker was nearly dead and Luke alive and well. However, there was still Big Gizz to worry about. Gizz, furious at losing more than half his gang to Luke and Dash, leveled his rifle at Luke but was struck in the skull with a rock by Jix. Jix fulfilled his mission, allowing Luke to live so that Vader himself could deal with him.\n\n[[File:JixandGizz.jpg|thumb|Jix and [[Gizman|Big Gizz]]]]\nLater, Jix was still with the swoop gang as [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] delivered [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], still frozen in carbonite, to Jabba the Hutt. Fett's ship, [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']], landed on the outskirts of Jabba's land, and a swoop rode out of the cargo hold, towing a hovering platform. Several bounty hunters pursued the swoop rider, presumably Fett. Also in pursuit was the swoop gang. Jix and Spiker were shot down. Spiker was severely wounded, ending up near-dead. Just then Jix hid a communications code book on Spiker's body in order to make him look like a traitor to Jabba the Hutt. The bounty hunters caught up with the swoop rider, only to find it was not Boba Fett at all, but a [[Zuckuss/Legends|decoy]]. The real Boba Fett had successfully handed in his bounty on Solo.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJix was created for the ''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]'' multimedia project, based on a background character in [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. His role in the story was originally filled by a character named \"Talan,\" created by [[John Wagner]] and described as the leader of a \"savage,\" \"nomadic space tribe.\"<ref>''[[The Secrets of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]'', p. 159</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Shadow Stalker]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}\n*[[Kenner Shadows of the Empire Special (Part 1)|Kenner ''Shadows of the Empire Special'', Part 1]]\n*[[Shadows of the Empire 2|''Shadows of the Empire'' 2]] {{1stID|Jix}}\n*[[Shadows of the Empire 3|''Shadows of the Empire'' 3]]\n*[[Shadows of the Empire 4|''Shadows of the Empire'' 4]]\n*[[Shadows of the Empire 5|''Shadows of the Empire'' 5]]\n*[[Shadows of the Empire 6|''Shadows of the Empire'' 6]]\n*{{WEGCite|book=Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook|story=The Backup Plan|stext=''The Backup Plan''}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[The Jabba Tape]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*{{GalaxyCite|7|ComicScan|ComicScan: The Graying of the Galaxy}}\n*''[[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Secrets of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]''\n*{{Topps|set=1996 Topps Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|cardname=Swoop Troop Attack}}\n*{{Topps|set=1996 Topps Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|cardname=Luke Axes a Swooper}}\n*{{SOTE|cardname=Jix and Big Gizz|link=https://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteTC081.jpg|archivedate=20171117000646}}\n*{{SOTE|cardname=Swoop|link=https://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteTC087.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qhDG}} {{Po}}\n*{{Topps|set=1996 Topps Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|cardname=Dash}}\n*{{SOTE|cardname=Dash Uncovers the Swoopers' Plot|link=https://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteTC096.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.is/4X5ha}}\n*{{Galoob|set=Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Micro Machines|text=''Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire'' Micro Machines|pack=Action Fleet Battle Packs #5|link=soteMMAFbp5.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010084316/www.rebelscum.com/soteMMAFbp5.asp}}\n*{{SOTEEMCC|cardname=ISSUE 2: Rescue Attempt on Gall|link=https://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteMIcards2bk.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.is/sdl7X}}\n*{{SOTEEMCC|cardname=ISSUE 6: Han Delivered|link=https://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/sote/soteMIcards6bk.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.is/4FlJZ}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Art of the Brothers Hildebrandt]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|7|Casting Shadows}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{FFCite|20|SWO1-2, ''Swoop Bikes''}}\n*{{FFCite|37|German Edition - JIX1-2, ''Wrenga \"Jix\" Jixton''}}\n*{{FFCite|70|XIZ1-4, ''The Rise of Prince Xizor''}}\n*{{FFCite|127|FRI3-4, ''Frija Torlock''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|89|Underworld: A Galaxy of Scum and Villainy}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Panel to Panel Volume 2: Expanding the Universe]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shadow_Syndicate#Card_gallery|cardname=Gang Warfare}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=The Shadow Syndicate|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shadow_Syndicate#Card_gallery|cardname=Jix}}\n}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Wrenga Jixton\n|es=Wrenga Jixton\n|ja=\u30ec\u30f3\u30ac\u30fb\u30b8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3\n|nl=Wrenga Jixton\n|pt=Wrenga Jixton\n|ru=\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d\n|pl=Wrenga Jixton\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jixton, Wrenga}}\n[[Category:Agents of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army enlisted personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Jabba's swoop gang]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]"}}}]}}}}
