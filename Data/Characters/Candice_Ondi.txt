Katarn and Ondi felt an attraction toward each other.\n\nShe was the original owner of the  modified [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[A-Cee]], and herself was equipped with a [[holocam/Legends|holocam]].\n\nDuring the [[Subjugation of Sulon]], she received Morgan's footage from his [[electrobinoculars/Legends|electrobinoculars]] documenting the assault of commandoes at [[Katarn homestead|his farm]]. Expecting [[Battle of the G-Tap|an Imperial assault]] at the [[G-Tap]], she went there with A-Cee preparing to document everything that would happen, and were joined by Morgan and other Rebels. Candice could see through Morgan's feigned optimism and they exchanged pleasantries, wishing the best for both.<ref>''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]''</ref>\n\nMorgan and Candice fought together. They witnessed the deaths of [[Jen (human)|Jen]] and [[Trol]], and Morgan ordered her and other survivors to retreat to the caves, but not before asking from her the services of A-Cee. As they retreated, Morgan narrated to the droid the events that transpired before the assault and covered the droid's departure.<ref>''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama]]''</ref> \n\nIt was the last time they saw each other, as Morgan retreated while she was covering the story; Candice was mortally wounded when the second [[AT-ST/Legends|AT-ST]] arraved, and A-Cee ran towards her. She attempted to say a final word, and died in his arms.\n==Appearance and traits==\n{{Quote|Candice, is that protocol droid of yours still functioning?|Morgan Katarn, asking about A-Cee|audio=CandiceOndi-DFSftE.ogg|Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama}}\nAt the time of her death, Candice Ondi looked like a pleasant middle-aged woman. Her face was smiley, marked by large intelligent brown-green eyes matching her brown hair. During business she wore the makeshift Rebel \"uniform\" of gray coveralls, which hid her otherwise nice figure. Her gestures and intimate behavior towards Morgan Katarn (which reminded him of his [[Patricia Katarn|dead wife]]) showed some personal affection.\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe narration of the ''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]'' gives a tense last meeting between Morgan Katarn and Candice, shortly before the Imperial assault, stating that they never saw each other again, as they both died in that fight. The [[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama|audio drama]] however shows that they fought together, until Morgan ordered her to lead others to the caves.\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|As \"Candace Ondi\"}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ondi, Candice}}\n[[Category:Alliance Intelligence members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Journalists]]\n[[Category:Sulonese]]"}}}]}}}}
