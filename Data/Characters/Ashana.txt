Elinda's fans admired her voice, and the band at last attracted the attention of the local, powerful businessman [[Davik Kang]], who invited them to play at his [[Davik Kang's estate|estate]]. Kang, however, was actually the head of the criminal organization the [[Exchange]], and Elinda feared the consequences should Kang somehow be malcontent with her performance or should she even have dealings with him at all. Such was her apprehension that in spite of Uksaris's conviction that Kang's sponsorship was too grand of an opportunity to reject, Elinda abandoned the band altogether.\n\nWithout a singer, the Twisted Rancor Trio seemed to be at its end, but on the eve of the scheduled performance, Uksaris recruited Ashana as a replacement for her sister. By Uksaris's own admission, the plan was risky given Ashana's untested singing and the last minute recruitment without prior rehearsals, and should Ashana fail to live up to Elinda's reputation, the band could incur the notorious wrath of Kang, putting their lives in jeopardy. Uksaris, however, believed that the scheme was still worth the risks, hoping that should they succeed, Kang would sign them up on a great touring contract.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAshana only appears as a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', if the player, as [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], visits an [[Lower City Apartments|apartment]] in the [[Lower City]] [[Lower City Apartments|Apartment]] containing a delivery to Uksaris secured by a [[Holo-Sec Corp]] [[Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive|anti-theft explosive]]. To safely disarm the trap, the player must activate all six [[Holoprojector/Legends|holoprojectors]] of the band members surrounding the [[Footlocker/Legends|footlocker]] in order of their recruitment. The solution to this puzzle is given in a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] resting on a nearby desk that contains a draft of ''[[Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio]]'', a brief narrative of the history of the band authored by Gilthos Uksaris.\n\nSince the incomplete chronicle ends on the eve of the scheduled performance when Ashana is recruited, her success or failure is unknown.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ashana\n|nl=Ashana\n|pl=Ashana\n|fi=Ashana\n|ru=\u0410\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Twisted Rancor Trio Band Members]]"}}}]}}}}
