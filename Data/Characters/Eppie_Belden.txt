She joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. She was 132 [[Standard year/Legends|years]] old by the time of the [[Bakura Incident]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Who are you, old woman?''\"<br />\"''Start guessing, youngster. I'm Orn Belden's revenge.''\"<br />\"''You can't be here, scarring of the neocortex is permanent.''\"<br />\"''Tell that to Commander Skywalker|[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Wilek Nereus]] and Eppie Belden|The Truce at Bakura}}\n[[File:Eppie_Belden.png|thumb|left|Eppie Belden]]\nShe [[Marriage/Legends|married]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Orn Belden]] in [[97 BBY]], the same [[Standard year/Legends|year]] as a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] uprising on [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]]. Sometime afterward, they had their only child, [[Roviden Belden|Roviden]]. She had a personality that was described as \"fiery,\" to match her hair, and was the first adult friend of [[Gaeriel Captison]].\n\nAlong with her husband and son, Eppie sympathized with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], although Bakura was independent and neutral during the conflict&mdash;until the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] annexed Bakura in [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]]. Roviden, who had become an agent of the Rebellion, was executed on order of Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]] [[Wilek Nereus]]; Eppie, who had also aided the Rebellion, was also ordered to be executed. Orn pleaded for her life, and Nereus agreed&mdash;instead of killing her, he merely destroyed her mind using a parasitic insect from the [[Jospro sector]]. The price for Orn, however, was the loss of his voice.\n\nEppie's condition\u2014which resembled advanced senility&mdash;was incurable until the [[Invasion of Bakura]], when [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to reverse the damage. She awoke to find that Nereus had killed her husband and arrested [[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister]] [[Yeorg Captison]], and&mdash;using her contacts in the Bakuran underground and her skills as a [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]]&mdash;initiated the Bakuran Revolution.\n\nDespite her age, she personally captured Nereus, and like other revolutionaries, was in favor of trying him in a revolutionary tribunal. However, with the surrender of the Imperial garrison and the release of Prime Minister Captison, the revolutionaries deferred authority back to the [[Bakuran Senate]] and handed Nereus over to Skywalker.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{FFCite|23|BAK3, ''The Truce at Bakura''}}\n*{{DB|character|beldens|Belden, Eppie and Orn|archivedate=20100209201056}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Eppie Belden\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belden, Eppie}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Bakurans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
