She lived with her boyfriend, the [[Trandoshan]] [[Assassin|hitman]] [[Nack Movers]], in his [[Nack Movers's residence|apartment]]. The [[Coruscant Security Force]] repeatedly tried and failed to bring him to justice for his [[Death|murders]]. Due to his growing paranoia, he hired the [[Terrelian Jango Jumper]] and thief [[Cassilyda Cryar]], also known as \"Cassie,\" to be his assistant and bodyguard. Marcy and Cryar grew close and became partners, which Movers failed to notice. Ignoring his girlfriend's entreaties, he made a lecherous proposition to Cryar. The two women began plotting to kill him and poisoned his [[Foodstuff|drink]] with [[Sennari]] [[poison]], which he used himself to kill his victims and was more susceptible to due to his Trandoshan biology.
