Ba'kif suggested Vurawn be transferred to the [[Taharim Academy]] on [[Naporar]] after his acceptance to the Mitth.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter an [[attack on Csilla]], the [[Nine Ruling Families]] convened with Ba'kif to discuss their next steps. Ba'kif deducted that the attack was meant to distract the Chiss Ascendancy from an event that had already occurred. During the meeting, an [[Ba'kif's aide|aide]] located [[Senior Captain]] Mitth'raw'nuruodo \"Thrawn\" on Naporar.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nBa'kif and Thrawn travelled to the [[Dioya system]] in hopes of examining the wreckage of a refugee ship. They deduced that, due to the damage pattern destroying the ship rather than demobilizing the ship, the attacking force had not been [[pirate]]s. Ba'kif and Thrawn donned boarding suits and boarded the drifting craft.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA blue-skinned Chiss male, Supreme General Ba'kif both admired the tactical genius of Senior Captain Thrawn and saw the officer's political ineptitude. Ba'kif was capable of making \"soothing noises\" to mollify politicians of the [[Chiss Syndicure]] even as his thoughts dwelled on tactical matters and strategic planning. Ba'kif was steadfast about enforcing the separation of powers between the Syndicure and the [[Chiss Defense Force]], taking opportunities to \"remind\" the civilian leaders that only the [[Defense Hierarchy Council]] had authority over the military.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBa'kif first appeared in the [[2020]] novel ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'', written by [[Timothy Zahn]] as the first novel of ''[[Star Wars: The Ascendancy Trilogy]]''. In that trilogy, Ba'kif plays a role as a mentor, benefactor, supporter, and occasional detractor of the trilogy's titular character Thrawn.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]''\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Ba'kif\n|ru=\u0411\u0430'\u043a\u0438\u0444\n}}\n\n[[Category:Admirals and generals]]\n[[Category:Chiss]]\n[[Category:Chiss Defense Force flag officers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naporar residents]]\n[[Category:Stybla family]]"}}}]}}}}
