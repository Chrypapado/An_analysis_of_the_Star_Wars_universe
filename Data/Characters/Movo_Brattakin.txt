After Greck nearly murdered him, Movo merged his mind with the metallic body of his aide [[B-9D7]]. He then reprogrammed [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] to lead a [[droid rebellion]] to topple [[Boonda/Legends|Boonda]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], allying himself with [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] in order to join the rebellion and gain access to Boonda's facilities. However, Artoo discovered his true identity and was able to keep Brattakin occupied long enough for him to be shot by [[Jace Forno]], his former henchwoman who objected to a droid giving her orders, even if it had a Human brain.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Droids (1995) 1|''Droids '' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Droids (1995) 2|''Droids '' 2]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Droids (1995) 3|''Droids '' 3]] {{Hologram}}\n*[[Droids (1995) 4|''Droids '' 4]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[C-3PO: Tales of the Golden Droid]]''\n*{{FFCite|25|POL2, ''501-Z Police Droid''}}\n*{{FFCite|129|MOV1-2, ''B-9D7 - Movo Brattakin's Assistant''}}\n*{{FFCite|133|MOV3-4, ''B-9D7 - Movo Brattakin's Assistant''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Movo Brattakin\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brattakin, Movo}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
