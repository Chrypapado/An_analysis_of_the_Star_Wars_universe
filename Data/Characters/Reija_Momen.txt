[[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] believed she resembled [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|his mother]].\n\n==Biography==\nWhen Momen was young, her father took out a loan from the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan/Legends|InterGalactic Banking Clan]] to help the mortgage on the family farm. When bad harvests made him unable to pay it back, the Clan confiscated their holdings, requiring the family to move to the [[City/Legends|city]]. This led to her father's depression and eventual [[Death/Legends|death]], and left Reija with a lasting hatred of [[Muun/Legends|Muuns]].\n\nIn [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]], Reija was made chief administrator of the [[Intergalactic Communications Center]], due to the fact she liked the job as opposed to the large salary. The workers at the Communications Center referred to her as \"Momma Momen.\" She considered eventually retiring to start a family on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]].\n\nAfter being taken hostage by [[Pors Tonith/Legends|Pors Tonith]] during the [[Battle of Praesitlyn]], Tonith used Momen to send a message to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], demanding Republic forces evacuate Praesitlyn or the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] would start killing hostages. Momen read the message, but against orders, she ordered the Republic to attack. She was rescued by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], only to be shot by a [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droid]] and die in his arms, having shielded him from the blast.\n\nBecause of her physical resemblance to [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|Shmi Skywalker]], Anakin found himself reliving his mother's death. Momentarily tapping into the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], he proceeded to cut a swath of destruction through Tonith's security forces and nearly killed the Separatist [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] before being stopped by the spirit of [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Trial]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Reija Momen\n|es=Reija Momen\n|ru=\u0420\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Momen, Reija}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
