A native of the [[Corellian system]], he was apparently obsessed with droids, writing lengthy tracts and missives about organics rising up and freeing droids \"from their cruel servitude.\" The MLF had already been in operation for several years when he advanced to a position of leadership, but he stepped up their activities, inflicting severe damage on the facilities of [[Industrial Automaton/Legends|Industrial Automaton]], [[MerenData/Legends|MerenData]], and [[Sienar Intelligence Systems/Legends|Sienar Intelligence Systems]], typically using [[Detonite/Legends|detonite]] explosive devices. Sneel was an expert droid programmer, droid technician, and demolitions expert.\n\n[[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] agents suspected Jarred Sneel may have been running the MLF as a front organization for the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]. [[Corporate Sector Authority/Legends|Corporate Sector Authority]] [[Security Police|Espos]] treated them as common criminals, perhaps working for competing business interests. Imperial agents simply regarded them as terrorist fanatics. Sneel's true motivation was never clear.\n\nOne tactic used by the Empire and the Espos to discourage the MLF was to instruct the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] news networks to report on MLF bombings as if the MLF were a fanatical ''anti-droid'' group rather than a droid's rights group. Imperial agents suspected the Corporate Sector Authority of running illegal Espo operations against the MLF from within Imperial territory.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cynabar's Fantastic Technology: Droids]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sneel, Jarred}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]\n[[Category:Terrorists]]"}}}]}}}}
