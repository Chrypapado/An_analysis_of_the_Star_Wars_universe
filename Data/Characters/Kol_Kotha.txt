Besides, we haven't shut down the Trade Federation yet!|Kol Kotha to [[Gavyn Sykes]]|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\nThe [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Gran/Legends|Gran]] '''Kol Kotha''' led a dangerous life, and years of [[Pirate/Legends|piracy]] and [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] had hardened him. His dealing of illegal arms in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] attracted the attention of [[Borvo]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. In need of Kol's extensive weapons knowledge and [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]] skills, Borvo [[Nal Raka Criminal Empire|hired]] him as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]].<ref name=\"LucasArts\">{{LucasArtsCite|url=products/naboo/index_ie.html|text=Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo|archivedate=20010609040717}}</ref>\n\nWhen Naboo was [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|invaded]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], Borvo allied with [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Kael (officer)|Kael]] and [[Gavyn Sykes]] of the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]]. The two pilots had [[Mission to the Naboo mountains|rescued]] [[Borvo the Hutt's freighter|Borvo's personal transport]], which Kotha was flying at the time. Kotha then went on to fly several [[Attack on disabled base|missions]] for the [[Naboo Resistance|resistance]] in his [[Borvo the Hutt's starfighter|starfighter]]. When Borvo betrayed the resistance and began selling the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]] as [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]], however, Kotha allied with Sykes and helped [[Attack on Porso Hill|destroy]] his former employer's operation.\n\nAfterwards Kol [[Liberation of Camp Four|assisted in freeing]] several more officers and pilots from [[Camp Four/Legends|Camp Four]] in order to increase the resistance movement against the Trade Federation. He continued to [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|fight along side]] Sykes and the Naboo until the Federation was eventually [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|defeated]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Good work, Naboo boy.
