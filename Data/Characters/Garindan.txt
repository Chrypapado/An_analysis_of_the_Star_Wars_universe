Many believed that he was wildly wealthy, though his vast amounts of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] were only seen when he paid for information. He was seen carrying the [[Model 434 blaster pistol]], popular among [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] and [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]].\n\nGarindan's information was priceless, and his skills went to the highest bidder, whether it be to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] (who was wary of Garindan finding out too much about Jabba's business transactions) or to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]]. Garindan was apparently capable of finding out a wide variety of information, as evidenced when he gave the possible whereabouts to Jabba concerning the fabled [[Yavin Vassilika]].\n\nAround [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">''[[The Mos Eisley Cantina Pop-Up Book]]'' is set by the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] events of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] take place, which corresponds to [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] per ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''.</ref> Garindan visited [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], where he observed a [[Lightfight|shootout]] between [[Rff Huff]] and [[Purong]].<ref name=\"Cantina Pop-Up\">''[[The Mos Eisley Cantina Pop-Up Book]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:SearchingMosEisley-SWI145.jpg|thumb|Garindan with Zeta Squadron]]\nJust prior to the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he was hired by the local Imperial prefect to find two missing [[Droid/Legends|droids]]. Once he discovered them, he followed the droids and their new owner to [[Docking Bay 94/Legends|Docking Bay 94]] and called in a squad of Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] to attack. Despite this, the droids were able to escape, in part due to the help of stormtrooper [[Davin Felth/Legends|Davin Felth's]] betrayal when he shot his commanding officer in the back.\n\nAfterward, Garindan met with the [[Ketton/Legends|Ketton]] [[Spy/Legends|spy]] [[Derrida/Legends|Derrida]] and conferred. The meeting was witnessed by [[Meyser Kayson]]'s son, who reported it to the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"air\">''[[Alliance Intelligence Reports]]''</ref>\n\nGarindan later was interrogated by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]] to discover the location of his cousin, [[Udin]]. He also discovered that [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] had sold a [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], helping [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] to confirm the origins and identity of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star's]] destroyer. After the battle of Yavin Garindan went to Hoth. He had heard there where jedi hunters hunting a jedi. Garindan was paid by pirates to find the location of the jedi. Garindan killed the crew of pirates and gave the information to the jedi hunters.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGarindan's eyes were hidden beneath dark goggles, as they were extremely sensitive to the harsh sunlight of Tatooine. His name translated to \"Blessed One,\" \"Burnt wood,\" \"dust from a windstorm,\" \"ugly,\" and \"toast\" in five different languages.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Garindan_SWGTCG-AoD.jpg|thumb|200px|Garindan within the shadows of Mos Eisley]]\nGarindan was played by [[Sadie Eden|Sadie Eddon]] in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']]. His voice is a processed version of [[John Wayne]]'s.<ref>''[[Star Wars Insider 110]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[Star Wars (1977) 2|''Star Wars'' (1977) 2]], Garindan is portrayed as [[Human/Legends|Human]].\n\nIn ''[[LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]'', Garindan is referred to simply as \"Imperial Spy\" and is actually a boss in Episode IV chapter three, where you have to \"kill\" him to escape in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. He dresses up as a [[Rebel pilot/Legends|Rebel pilot]] and infiltrates the award ceremony after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], but is quickly discovered and led away.\n\nAfter the completion of Episode IV chapter three, \"Imperial Spy\" is unlocked for purchase in the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] Cantina. However, similar to Chancellor Palpatine, he carries no weapons. When the attack button is pressed, Garindan pulls out a communication device (similar to a walkie-talkie) and speaks into it, similar to his only appearance in ''A New Hope''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 1|''Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika'' 1]]\n*''[[Empire Blues: The Devaronian's Tale]]''\n*''[[The Mos Eisley Cantina Pop-Up Book]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (junior novelization)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' junior novel]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 2|''Star Wars'' (1977) 2]]\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]\n*''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''\n*{{WEGCite|book=Mos Eisley Adventure Set|story=There's Many a Slip Betwixt Cup and Lip}}\n*''[[The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Journal: Hero for Hire]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n===Non-canon appearances===\n*{{TFU|USE=1}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'' {{C|Named \"Imperial Spy\"}}\n*''[[LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]] ''{{C|Named \"Imperial Spy\"}}\n*{{Tales|14|The Emperor's Court}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Garindan}}\n*''[[Cantina Communications]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope]]''\n*''[[Mos Eisley Cantina Adventure Set]]''\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Screen Entertainment]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]\n*{{KennerCite|set=Star Wars: The Power of the Force (1995 toy line)|text=''Star Wars: The Power of the Force'' (1995)|pack=Garindan (Long Snoot)|link=POTF2garindan.asp|archivedate=20191217054157}}\n*''[[Alliance Intelligence Reports]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{CCG|set=Premiere Limited|link=Premiere-Dark/large/garindan.gif|cardname=Garindan}}\n*''[[Mos Eisley Adventure Set]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Action Figure Archive]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Power of the Jedi]]''\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''\n*{{FFCite|11|GAR1-4, ''Garindan''}}\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*{{FFCite|138|LAB2, ''Labria''}}\n*''[[Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy]]''\n*''[[Bounty Hunters (Star Wars Miniatures)]]''\n*''[[Beware the Dark Side]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 18]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Agents_of_Deception#Card_gallery|cardname=Garindan}}\n*{{InsiderCite|111|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 31]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Art: Visions]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Head-to-Head Tag Teams]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'' {{C|Card: Garindan}}\n*{{DB|character|garindan|Garindan (Long Snoot)|archivedate=20110517075133}}\n*{{DB|character|tzizvvt|Tzizvvt|archivedate=20110911235104}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/explore/classic/2000/10/classic20001002.html|text=Zit-umm-woop-new|archivedate=20041103002908}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/05/photoreceptor20040507.html|text=They Went That-a Way}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Garindan#legends\n|es=Garindan\n|nl=Garindan ezz Zavor\n|pl=Garindan\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Kubaz]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
