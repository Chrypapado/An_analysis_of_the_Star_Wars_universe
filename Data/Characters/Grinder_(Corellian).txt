His muscular arms and torso were covered in colorful [[Tattoo/Legends|tattoos]], and his personal hygiene was questionable. He rarely bathed, and his hands were permanently covered in grease. He always wore his racing outfit out of fear that it might get stolen.\n\nHis personality was anything but sympathetic. He never spoke kindly to anyone and would not lend a helping hand without some sort of reward. He was loyal towards the leader of the Black Seraphs, [[Sunny Bounder/Legends|Sunny Bounder]], but only selectively so, and he would not hesitate to rat her out for the right reward.\n\nWhat he lacked in personality, he made up for as a mechanic, having savant skills with swoop and [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] engines. He was also decent with a [[vibroknife]] and a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGrinder serves as an antagonist, with rival status, in the role-playing game modular encounter scenario ''Taming the Dragon'' as part of the ''[[Suns of Fortune]]'' supplement. His selective loyalty is specified by the possibility that, if offered enough credits or leadership of the Black Seraphs by the player characters, he may not only reveal Sunny Bounder's secrets but also help the player characters fight Bounder.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{FFG|book=Suns of Fortune|story=Taming the Dragon}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Black Seraphs]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]"}}}]}}}}
