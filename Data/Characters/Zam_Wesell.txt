As a Clawdite, Wesell possessed the ability to physically [[Changeling|alter]] her appearance&mdash;a power which she used to assume the visage of a [[human]] female. Prior to the [[First Battle of Geonosis|beginning]] of the [[Clone Wars]], the [[bounty]] hunter [[Jango Fett]] enlisted Wesell's aid to [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|assassinate]] [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] in [[22 BBY]]. Her efforts ultimately failed, however, resulting in Wesell's [[death]] at the hands of Fett before she could identify him as the would-be [[assassin]] to Amidala's [[Jedi]] [[bodyguard]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\n{{Quote|I think 'he' is a 'she'. And I think she is a changeling.|Anakin Skywalker, to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\nA [[Clawdite]] [[Gender|female]], Wesell was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Zolan]]. [[Gender|She]] was trained by the [[Mabari]] until she desired wealth and journeyed to [[Denon]] to employ her skills and training as an [[assassin]]. At some point, Wesell worked with [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]],<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> and became both his frequent accomplice and sometime partner.\n\n===Assassination plot and death===\n{{Quote|Who hired you? Tell us. Tell us now!''\"<br />\"''It was a bounty hunter called&mdash;|Anakin Skywalker, and Zam Wesell, shortly before the latter's death|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\n[[File:ZamWesell-SWZ.png|thumb|left|250px|Zam Wesell disguised as a human while on Coruscant]]\nIn 22 BBY,<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\" /> Wesell was hired by Fett to [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|assassinate]] [[Naboo]] [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] to prevent her from speaking up against the [[Military Creation Act]]. Sometime later, Wesell bombed the Senator's [[J-type diplomatic barge|cruiser]] when it reached [[Coruscant]]. However, Amidala herself wasn't on the [[cruiser]]. Instead, it was her [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden]], [[Cord\u00e9]]. After receiving the news, Wesell told Fett that she had bombed the ship, but she used a decoy. Fett then gave her some [[kouhun]]s and told her to be careful while holding them as they were very [[poison]]ous. Wesell sent a [[ASN courier droid|droid]] to do it for her, but two [[Jedi]] had been assigned to protect the senator: [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Skywalker quickly [[Death|killed]] the kouhuns and Kenobi grabbed the droid. While the droid was speeding through an express way, Wesell shot it with [[KiSteer 1284 projectile rifle|her projectile rifle]] which caused Kenobi to start falling through Coruscant's [[atmosphere]].\n\nWesell quickly fled in her [[Koro-2 all-environment Exodrive airspeeder|speeder]] but the Jedi were able to pursue her with a commandeered open-top [[XJ-6 airspeeder]]. Wesell took her speeder on a nosedive\u2014plunging 2,670 meters toward the lower levels of [[Corusca Circus]]. With the Jedi relentlessly pursuing her, Wesell flew through the exhaust flames of the [[Kerdos Company recycling plant]], hoping that the flames would scorch her adversaries in the open-top speeder. Seeing the pair still chasing her and unharmed by the flames, Wesell fired at the couplings of a nearby electrical plant, causing the Jedi's speeder to be inundated by electrical shock. The bounty hunter then steered her craft into a network of tunnels, aiming once again to lose the pursuing Jedi. Skywalker did not chase directly into tunnel, but opted to travel an alternate route. Wesell wove through tunnels, reaching speeds of 400 kilometers per hour. Upon exiting the network at the [[Cybot Galactica]] droid research institute, the bounty hunter was surprised when Skywalker suddenly jumped on top of her airspeeder. During a struggle to get Skywalker off her speeder, Wesell briefly [[Changeling|shapeshifted]] into her Clawdite form which caused Skywalker to realize she was a changeling. The Jedi ignited his lightsaber and sliced at the windscreen, knocking out the guidance systems. Wesell shot the lightsaber out of Skywalker's hand, but the ensuing struggle caused Wesell to misfire her blaster pistol, damaging the control pipes.\n\nAfter crashing her speeder into [[Vos Gesal Street]] in the [[Uscru Entertainment District]], Wesell was able to flee into the [[Outlander Club]]. Skywalker was about to dash in but Kenobi reminded his Padawan that Wesell had gone in to hide, not to run. Once inside the club, Skywalker told Kenobi he knew that Wesell was a changeling and that she was a female. Kenobi said they should be extra careful in searching for her. As the pair went their separate ways with Skywalker looking for Wesell and Kenobi getting a drink, Wesell approached Kenobi from behind and attempted to shoot him, but Kenobi sensed her and [[Dismemberment|chopped]] her [[Limb|arm]] off with his [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's second lightsaber|lightsaber]]. Wesell screamed in pain and fell to the ground. Kenobi and Skywalker carried Wesell outside and asked her if she knew who she was trying to kill. Wesell answered that she knew it was a Senator from Naboo. Then she was asked who hired her but, Wesell answered that it was merely a job as she was reluctant to reveal her employer's name. Skywalker then pressured her to tell them and Wesell was about to say who it was when Fett, who had been watching the whole interrogation, shot her in the neck with a [[Kamino saberdart]]. Wesell then said her final words, cursing at Fett in [[Huttese]] and died shortly after.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Wee shahnit&hellip;sleemo.|Zam Wesell's last words|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\nWesell preferred to strike her targets from afar, utilizing long-range [[sniper rifle]]s or remote [[probe droid]]s.<ref name=\"USW\" /> Despite being a [[changeling]], Wesell took on the form of a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] and kept this form while hiding from the Jedi in the [[Outlander Club]]. When captured and interrogated by [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], Wesell refused to give the names of her employers, but upon being pressured by Skywalker, Wesell was about to give in to the Jedi's demands, only for her partner [[Jango Fett]] to kill her before she could reveal the names of their employers.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a changeling was able to assume the appearance of anyone she chose, including her targets.<ref name=\"USW\" /> She was capable of taking on any [[humanoid]] form.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> As she died, she reverted from speaking [[Galactic Basic Standard]] to [[Clawdite (language)|Clawdite]],<ref name=\"Language\">{{SWKidsYoutube|CZp8Civk2co|Every Language in Star Wars Movies &#124;
