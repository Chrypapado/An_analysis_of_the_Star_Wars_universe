Cubber worked with [[Kell Tainer]] to get and keep the squadron's [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wings]], [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]], and their [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] in running order.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I was a year on Hoth, passing by that slab of rust and bad wiring everyday.

You can always recognize her by the specific pattern of corrosion.|Cubber Daine, referring to the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]|X-Wing: Wraith Squadron}}\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Cubber Daine served for a year on Hoth. As a mechanic, he relied especially on a [[WED Treadwell repair droid/Legends|treadwell droid]] to assist him in his repairs, as he found the many appendages and arms of this type of droid highly useful. He would show his treadwell to others, informing them about its usefulness. He was known for doing favors, such as modifying R2 units, in return for pilot training. He also hated factory-new X-wings, because they had a tendency to malfunction.\n\nHe did, however, have a tendency to lie about how much it would take to fix them, so that [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] would think he was working harder than he was. He had a six-year old daughter, who he claimed could lie better than [[Kell Tainer]].\n\nHe was the father of [[Zindra Daine]], a fighter pilot during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|9|Wraith Squadron (article)|Wraith Squadron}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Cubber Daine\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daine, Cubber}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Wraith Squadron personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
