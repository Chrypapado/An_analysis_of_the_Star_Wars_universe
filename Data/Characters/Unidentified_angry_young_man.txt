I think she's in league with the Trade Federation. I know she's in league with the people who ravaged our planet. The Queen must be stopped, and the truth must be revealed.|The angry young man shares his adjusted point of view.|Star Wars: Invasion of Theed Adventure Game}}\nIn [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] invaded the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. One [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]] citizen, an '''angry young man''', fled into the swamps surrounding Naboo's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]], [[Theed/Legends|Theed]]. While in the wilderness, he fell under the [[Mind trick/Legends|hypnotic]] influence of [[Savor Kibbs]], a charismatic [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark]] [[Force Adept]] that had been rejected for [[Padawan/Legends|training]] by the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jedi Council/Legends|Council]]. Under Kibbs' influence, the angry young man became an unreasoning fanatic that opposed the leadership of Naboo's [[Queen/Legends|Queen]], [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], and promoted Kibbs' superiority.\n\nKibbs developed a plan to use the angry young man, as well as other refugees that had fallen under his influence, to disrupt the peace treaty between the Naboo and the native [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]] so that he could seize control of the planet for himself. Elements of the plot were discovered by [[Lialla Tane]], a Human female agent of the [[Naboo Underground]]. The Underground, an organization that had successfully resisted the Trade Federation's occupation, dispatched several capable agents, mostly students from Theed's [[Royal House of Learning]] lead by Tane, to investigate Kibb's renegades. When the agents discovered Kibbs' encampment, the angry young man and other renegades, a [[Unidentified Gungan warrior|Gungan warrior]] and a [[Unidentified tough-looking woman|tough-looking woman]], challenged the convictions of the Underground's agents.\n\nEventually, Savor Kibbs himself intervened, attacking the agents with [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Force power/Legends|powers]] and a reprogrammed [[Droideka/Legends|Droideka]], but was ultimately defeated. The dark hold he had over his followers vanished, and the refugees, including the angry young man, were returned to the city of Theed and a normal state of mind.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Invasion of Theed Adventure Game]]''\n\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
