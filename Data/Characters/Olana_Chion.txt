Born on [[Kegan]] in [[45 BBY/Legends|45 BBY]] as '''O-Lana''', she became a point of contention between the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and Kegan's [[Benevolent Guide]]s. The Order sought to [[Jedi training/Legends|train]] her as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], whereas the Guides foresaw that fraternization with the Jedi and the Republic would lead to devastation in the years to come. The Guides kidnapped O-Lana but had their efforts thwarted by the Jedi [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]]. O-Lana was then accepted as a [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi Initiate]] and taken to the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].\n\nO-Lana took the name of \"Olana Chion\" while growing up in the [[Jedi Temple]] in order to more suitably fit in with her peers. She fervently hoped to become the [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] of Kenobi, but when he took on the young Human boy [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] instead, she developed an ire towards Skywalker that lasted for over a decade. Chion eventually [[Padawan/Legends|apprenticed]] to [[Avan Post]] when she came of age, and he trained her for ten [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before being [[Death/Legends|killed]] at the onset of the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]-spanning [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]. The [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] soon after promoted Chion to the rank of Jedi Knight, hoping that she could lead [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] in the war.\n\nChion instead chose a more pacifist approach to wartime service and devoted her attention to the refugees of ravaged [[Planet/Legends|worlds]]. When [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] launched an [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|attack]] on Coruscant [[19 BBY/Legends|three years]] into the war, she was tasked with evacuating and coordinating millions of the capital's [[Coruscanti/Legends|residents]]. The attack was repelled, and the war itself ended shortly thereafter with the [[Order 66/Legends|betrayal]] of the Jedi Order by the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic's]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]]. Skywalker, now a [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] to the [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Chancellor]], led an [[Operation: Knightfall|attack]] on the Jedi Temple, and Chion was among the first of his victims.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and kidnapping===\n{{Quote|Tell us how we can help you. What do you think happened to O-Lana?''\"<br />\"''We are worried about her safety. There are whispers and rumors about children who vanish.|Adi Gallia and V-Nen|Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth}}\nO-Lana was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] in [[45 BBY/Legends|45 BBY]] to [[V-Nen]] and [[O-Melie]] on the oppressive and isolated [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Kegan]]. Her parents realized very early that their child was special, and despite Kegan's taboo against contacting the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], they requested that the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] test their child for [[Force-sensitive/Legends|sensitivity]] to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Understanding the fragile diplomatic situation on Kegan, the Council dispatched four [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]: [[Jedi Master/Legends|Masters]] [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]] and [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and their respective [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]], [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref name=\"fft\" />\n\nHowever, the [[Benevolent Guide]]s that ruled the planet saw a grave future should the Jedi take the child. They had [[Force vision/Legends|visions]] of white-armored [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] raining destruction down upon their planet, and they decided to avert this crisis before it could become a reality. They spirited O-Lana away to the [[Re-Learning Circle]], a [[Prison/Legends|prison]]-like compound to which certain youths were banished and fed anti-Republic [[Propaganda/Legends|propaganda]]. However, the two Jedi Padawans Tachi and Kenobi found their way into the Re-Learning Circle. They saved O-Lana with the help of Jinn and Gallia and in the process shut down the Circle and overthrew the Guides. The foursome then took O-Lana away from her parents to be [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"fft\" />\n\n===Training===\n{{Quote|If O-Lana is strong in the Force, her powers will become more apparent as she grows. These powers should be nurtured and directed. When they are not, the child can become confused and frightened.|Qui-Gon Jinn|Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth}}\nSeeking to break all ties from her conflicted and isolationist homeworld, O-Lana abandoned the gender-defined structure of her name and dubbed herself \"Olana Chion\". She spent her entire childhood in the [[Jedi Temple|temple]], learning the Jedi arts, though never being accepted by a Master. She greatly admired Kenobi, her rescuer from Kegan, and aspired to become his Padawan learner upon his promotion to the rank of Jedi Knight. Her chances for acceptance, though, grew less and less likely as she neared her thirteenth [[Birthday/Legends|birthday]], at which point she would likely be sent to the [[Agricultural Corps/Legends|Agricultural Corps]] or some other subdivision of the Order. Kenobi returned from his latest [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|mission]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] a Jedi Knight, but much to Chion's disappointment, he had already found his apprentice: [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], a nine-[[Standard year/Legends|year]]-old boy purported to be the [[Chosen One/Legends|Chosen One]] of Jedi legend.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nChion disliked Skywalker purely for the reason that he was Kenobi's Padawan, as opposed to her. She had banked thirteen years of training on being apprenticed to Kenobi, but her hopes had been dashed, due to the dying wish of Qui-Gon Jinn, another of her saviors from Kegan. But even as her situation looked dire, Chion was accepted by [[Avan Post]], a [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrilan]] Jedi Master, and began her life as a Padawan learner.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===Apprenticeship under Avan Post===\nIn [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], Chion began her apprenticeship to Post in earnest. For over a decade, she was instructed in the proper manner, and was successfully fitted to the Jedi Knight mold.<ref name=\"db\" /> Unfortunately for Chion, Skywalker, along with Kenobi and Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|instigated]] the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] on [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]], sending [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] into turmoil.<ref name=\"aotc\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> But while Skywalker embraced the war fully and become a decorated hero, tragedy struck Chion early on. In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the first year of the war, Post perished in a [[Starfighter combat/Legends|dogfight]] over the [[Ocean/Legends|ocean]] world of [[Ando/Legends|Ando]], after destroying seven [[Hardcell-class interstellar transport/Legends|''Hardcell''-class interstellar transports]].<ref name=\"hnn1\">''[[Republic HoloNet News Core Edition 14:3:22]]''</ref>\n\n===Clone Wars===\n[[File:OlanaChion-DB.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Olana Chion in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]]]\nDespite the loss of Post, Chion had completed the bulk of her training under her former master, and was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight with very little pomp and circumstance. Her promotion was out of necessity, as the Republic needed all the Jedi they could get in order to give the newly minted [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] suitable battlefield [[Commander/Legends|commanders]]. But Chion was uneasy with war, feeling that it strongly conflicted with the Jedi teachings that she had been raised on. Though she was not opposed to using her skills to keep the peace, she chose to help coordinate the war effort behind the scenes.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nChion's dislike of Skywalker was enhanced by his barnstorming and dashing exploits across the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. He made himself the darling and hero of many worlds, but nothing he could do could shake Chion's doubt of his intentions, as she kept track of his progress and actions throughout the war. She distrusted him, seemingly more and more as he rose throughout the ranks of public and Jedi acclaim.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nAway from the [[Capital/Legends|capital]], Chion was placed in charge of the evacuation of endangered worlds, as the battlefronts continuously expanded and swept across the galaxy. As the war dragged on into [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] launched what it hoped to be a final strike, when General [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|swept]] into Coruscant at the head of a massive [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|droid army]]. Though the attack had the sole purpose of kidnapping [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], the diversion of Grievous's [[Army/Legends|army]] was no illusion. Many sectors of the [[City/Legends|city]] world were extensively damaged, forcing families out of their homes, and out of shelter. Chion was tasked with evacuating and coordinating the millions of homeless [[Sentience/Legends|sentients]], and keeping them safe until Grievous could be driven away.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n[[File:OlanaWalkies-RotS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chion walks past [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], just outside one of the [[Jedi Temple]]'s many [[Jedi Temple communication center/Legends|briefing rooms]].]]\nWith Coruscant successfully defended, the Clone Wars looked set to wind down and finally end, following the [[Death/Legends|death]] of Confederate leader [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], at the hands of Skywalker, no less. The Republic's [[Outer Rim Sieges/Legends|Outer Rim Sieges]] persisted, though, and Chion attended a briefing by Kenobi as to the situation on worlds such as [[Boz Pity/Legends|Boz Pity]] and [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]]. By pure coincidence, Chion's leaving of the [[Jedi Temple communication center/Legends|briefing room]] coincided with the entrance of the object of her derision, \"The [[Hero With No Fear/Legends|Hero With No Fear]]\", Anakin Skywalker. But still, Chion's concerns were not echoed by the upper echelons of the galactic community, and Skywalker was promoted to the Jedi Council as a liaison to Palpatine.<ref name=\"rots\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\n====Operation: Knightfall====\nWhen Palpatine, who was secretly the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Sidious, let [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]]&mdash;an order which called for the execution of all Jedi&mdash; issue forth across the galaxy,<ref name=\"rots\" /> Chion was staying at the Temple with Masters [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]] and [[Cin Drallig/Legends|Cin Drallig]].

Hundreds of Jedi fell to either Vader's blade or the [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]]' [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], and Chion's suspicions about Skywalker came full circle, as did the Kegan Guide's vision of white-clad troopers. She attempted to save as many [[Youngling/Legends|younglings]] as possible. It was presumed that she eventually fell prey to the onslaught, even though her body was never conclusively identified.<ref name=\"db\" /> Even so, her image was posted, though marked as dead, and a fictional bounty placed on her head, as a propaganda tool in far-flung worlds of the galaxy.<ref name=\"is\">[[Star Wars Insider 87|''Star Wars Insider'' 87]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nChion was both fearful of new things and jealous of the more privileged. She had set her hopes on becoming Obi-Wan Kenobi's apprentice, only to have her goal achieved by Anakin Skywalker. From then on, she had an intense disdain for Skywalker, purely on the principle that he took the role that she had been vying for. Skywalker could do no good in her [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], with every step he took lowering his standing with her. She even took lengths to avoid the choices he made, averting herself from war and dedicating herself to more directly aiding the less fortunate. Chion had [[black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], [[brown]] eyes, fair skin, and stood at a height of 1.62 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]].<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Actually, although it wasn't my original intention, I'm quite pleased that one of Jude Watson's characters is now featured in one of the prequels.

The character would not appear again for half a decade, until [[Ian Tapley]] [[retcon]]ned her into [[George Lucas]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], through the [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature ''[[What's The Story?]]'' on [[StarWars.com]]. In ''Revenge of the Sith'', the character was originally just a Jedi extra played by [[Dominique Chionchio]]. Tapley's ''What's The Story?'' entry equated her with O-Lana and renamed her Olana Chion, deriving the character's surname from Chionchio's own. His [[Databank (original)|Databank]] entry was also elaborated on by [[Billy Buehler]] and \"[[Master Starkeiller]],\" but it was Tapley's retconning that made Chion one of the few C-[[canon]] elements to be elevated to the status of G-canon.<ref name=\"tfw\">{{Blog|thefragrantwookiee|44|Olana Chion: A 'What's the story?'

The final draft made Chion one of the few film characters to be \"killed off\" in the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]]. In addition to ''The Fight for Truth'', Tapley referenced several other Expanded Universe works while writing the entry, including ''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' and [[Star Wars: Clone Wars Volume Two|''Star Wars: Clone Wars'' Volume Two]]. In a rarity for ''What's the Story?'' winners, the entry was run by Jude Watson, in the event that she had any plans for the character.
