She later succeeded her father in becoming Councilor of the [[Sphere of Imperial Intelligence]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I am Darth Zhorrid, Lord of the Dark Council and successor to Darth Jadus.|Darth Zhorrid|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nDarth Zhorrid was the only known [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] [[Sith training|trained]] by her [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Darth Jadus]].<ref name=\"Holonet\" /> She had scars running from the edges of her mouth to her ears. In her early years, she found herself being talented at singing, something that even her father acknowledged. Later, Jadus specifically hired a tutor to teach his daughter, who wasn't a Sith back in that time, how to sing. It was when the Sith Lord set up an event in [[Kaas City]] for her only, that made overjoyed Zhorrid sing until she made all her subjects cry. Zhorrid sang her first and last opera for hours until she could sing no longer. It was then that Jadus chose to start her apprenticeship, as he know his daughter's love for him shall be reduced to hatred for the rest of her life.\n\nAfter her father's alleged murder at the hands of the terrorist known as the [[Eagle]], she was named a member of the [[Dark Council]] to take his place. She later summoned [[Cipher Nine]] to her offices on [[Korriban]], where she tested the agent's skills by ordering her guards to attack Nine. She then excused the Cipher to hunt down the terrorist cells.\n\nThough she demanded respect from her fellow Councilors, they simply laughed at her, viewing her as a child. She wished to seek revenge on Jadus' \"killer,\" the [[Eagle]], or all involved with him.\n\nCipher Nine managed to eradicate those who were a part of the [[Eagle's network]], which gave Zhorrid a chance to achieve more personal power. In [[3640 BBY]] the [[Star Cabal]] nearly brought [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]], one of the organizations operating inside her sphere of influence, to its knees. She disbanded the agency and, along with the Dark Council, established [[Sith Intelligence]], which she headed directly though she was later replaced with [[Lana Beniko]] by [[Darth Marr]].\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDarth Zhorrid wielded a single-bladed [[Sith lightsaber/Legends|Sith lightsaber]] in combat. Zhorrid was also capable of [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] and [[Force lightning/Legends#Force storm|Force storm]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDarth Zhorrid was first indirectly mentioned in Darth Jadus's [[The Holonet|Holonet]] entry on the website for [[BioWare]]'s [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''. The entry contains several [[Aurebesh/Legends|Aurebesh]] phrases; one of them is \"Daughter is only known apprentice.\"<ref name=\"Holonet\" />\n\nShe would be killed if the Agent decided to ally with the secretly-alive Darth Jadus, otherwise it can be presumed that the Agent remained loyal to Zhorrid.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Holonet|old=true|biographies|darth-jadus|Darth Jadus}} {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Darth Zhorrid#legends\n|pl=Darth Zhorrid\n|sr=Darth Zhorrid\n|ru=\u0414\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u0417\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0434\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zhorrid, Darth}}\n[[Category:Dark Councilors]]\n[[Category:Dromund Kaas residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Korriban residents]]\n[[Category:Members of the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence]]"}}}]}}}}
