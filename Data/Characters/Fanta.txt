During the race, a [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] named [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] continuously tried to peer over [[Gender/Legends|his]] shoulder to see the race on his hand held [[Viewscreen/Legends|viewscreen]]. This annoyed Fanta, who apparently wanted nothing to do with Binks, and he intentionally hid his screen from the Gungan's view throughout the race. Shortly after [[Ben Quadinaros/Legends|Ben Quadinaros']] [[Podracer/Legends|Podracer]] exploded before the second lap, Binks pounded on Fanta's back in excitement, which prompted the [[Poldt]] to grimace and try to move away.<ref name=\"Novelization\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nFanta was a male Poldt, a slender and uniquely sculpted [[Species/Legends|Species]].<ref name=\"Novelization\" />He possessed a sour attitude, at least towards Jar Jar Binks During the Boonta Eve Classic.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Phanta_the_Nimoidian.jpg|thumb|left|100px|A colored sketch labelled both as \"Nimoidian\" and \"Phanta\"]]\n{{Quote|What gooie-on?''\"<br />\"''Bug off.|Jar Jar Binks and Fanta in the screenplay|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace Illustrated Screenplay}}\nFanta the Poldt was to appear in the [[1999]] movie [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]. While his scene was ultimately left on the cutting room's floor, it remained in both the screenplay<ref name=\"TPMIS\">''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace Illustrated Screenplay]]''</ref> and in [[Terry Brooks]]' movie [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|novelization]], thus ensuring Fanta's [[Canon|canonicity.]]<ref name=\"Novelization\" /> To create the Poldt's likeness, Lucasfilm Ltd. used discarded pieces of Neimoidian concept art.<ref name=\"TPMIG\">''[[Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide]]''</ref> Originally, the Neimoidians were meant to be computer-generated, and George Lucas envisioned them as the organic models of the [[B1-Series battle droid]]s that made up the Trade Federation army. However, when the decision was made to portray the Neimoidians with actors wearing animatronic masks, the original design was deemed too impractical.<ref name=\"TPMmak\">''[[Star Wars: The Making of Episode I The Phantom Menace]]''</ref> The creation crew later took the discarded Neimoidian design and used it to create Fanta the Poldt. A few of the sketches shown in the interactive CD-ROM ''[[Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide]]'' are labelled both \"Neimoidian\" (or some variation of that word) and the name \"Phanta.\" Later sketches were just labelled \"Fanta,\" with no specific species.<ref name=\"TPMIG\" /> The original Neimoidian concept art was later refined into the Geonosians during the pre-production [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']].<ref name=\"dbG\">{{DB|species|geonosian|Geonosian|archivedate=20100330082859}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' novelization]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (unabridged audiobook)|''Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace'' unabridged audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace Illustrated Screenplay]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/galactic/2006/03/galactic20060306.html|text=Phantom Phanta}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fanta\n|nl=Fanta\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Poldts]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
