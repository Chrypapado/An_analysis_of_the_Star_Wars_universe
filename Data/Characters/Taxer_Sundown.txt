Sundown then blamed the deaths on the [[Mantellian Savrip/Legends|Mantellian Savrips]], and incited the villagers to kill them. In the meantime, Sundown set up his operations on [[Ten Mile Plateau]], where he operated a solar energy collection facility. He employed a group of [[Training lightsaber/Legends|training lightsaber]]-wielding enforcers to protect his facility, in an effort to enhance his projected image as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].\n\n[[File:Taxer2.jpg|thumb|left|Sundown's mind-control device.]]\n\n[[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who arrived on Ord Mantell while investigating the death of the [[Venan]] noble, Baron [[Sando (Baron)|Sando]], were attacked by Sundown's mercenaries, as he did not want their investigating to succeed. After defeating them, the two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] discovered that the enforcers lacked any independent will, as if Sundown were controlling them with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. When the Jedi began to discover Sundown's true motivations, he tried to capture their new-found ally, [[Nella Bold]], and kill them. This failed, however, and the Jedi, allied to a tribe of Savrips led by [[Mawkran]], defeated Sundown's private army, forcing him to flee the planet. When he tried to escape in Nella's [[T-24 airspeeder]], Obi-Wan managed to destroy its top fin, and Sundown was unable to control the craft. It crashed on Ten Mile Plateau, and Sundown's neck was broken in the crash. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan then discovered that Sundown had been using a [[mind control device]] to augment his claims of being a Jedi Knight, as part of a grander plot masterminded by the Venan Baroness [[Omnino]] to discredit the Jedi.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan: Last Stand on Ord Mantell 2|''Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan: Last Stand on Ord Mantell'' 2]] {{1st}}\n*[[Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan: Last Stand on Ord Mantell 3|''Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan: Last Stand on Ord Mantell'' 3]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|10|KEN4, ''Obi-Wan Kenobi''}}\n*{{FFCite|131|ORD2, ''Last Stand on Ord Mantell''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Taxer Sundown\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sundown, Taxer}}\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi impostors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mantellians]]"}}}]}}}}
