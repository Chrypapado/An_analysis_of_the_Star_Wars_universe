She had a prized garden of [[nannarium]]s. On her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] she was [[Duke/Legends|duchess]] of [[Mastigophorous]], and she was the aunt of [[Ebrihim]].\n\n==Biography==\nMarcha lived in a magnificent and sprawling [[Marcha's Estate|estate]] on Drall on the edge of a river. She helped [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] escape from his cousin, [[Thrackan Sal-Solo|Thrackan]], during the [[Corellian Crisis]]. As a result, when [[Governor-General/Legends|Governor-General]] [[Micamberlecto]] was killed in the fighting, [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Leia Organa Solo]] appointed Marcha to be the new Governor-General of the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]].\n\nDuring the early years of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], she reluctantly allowed the [[New Republic Defense Fleet/Legends|New Republic Defense Fleet]] to use [[Centerpoint Station]] as a weapon against the [[Yuuzhan Vong]]. Her allowance led to the disastrous [[Battle of Fondor (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Fondor]]; following the battle, she was kicked out of office, the [[Centerpoint Party]] came to power, and Thrackan Sal-Solo reclaimed his position of power.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Assault at Selonia]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*''[[Making a Full Recovery]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Governor-General/Legends|Governor-General]] of [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]]\n|years=[[18 ABY/Legends|18]]&mdash;c.
