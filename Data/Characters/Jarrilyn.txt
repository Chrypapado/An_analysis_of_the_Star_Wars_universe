She was also a member of [[The Cell]], a criminal faction wanting to oust and replace local crimelord [[Nirama]]. She wasn't very highly placed in the Cell, neither was the Darkside faction in the general Cell scheme.<ref name=\"MW\">''[[MidWorld]]''</ref>\n\nJarrilyn was one of the few remaining members of the Darkside contingent after a raid committed by [[Nirama]]'s forces in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]. Jarrilyn became a sort of spokesperson for the remaining members, including [[Ahlya]], [[Dor Balse]], [[Kruss Gaal]], [[Jasper]] and [[Michael (Darkside)|Michael]]. At that point, they were trying to recruit new members, including local [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]], [[Kaarl]] the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] and some newcomers, but the people in Darkside felt no respect for the local Cell. Shortly thereafter, they were captured by a group of spies working for Nirama.<ref name=\"MW\" />\n\nHer implication in The Cell and subsequent capture were public knowledge less than one month later.<ref name=\"UW\">''[[UnderWorld]]''</ref>\n\nAt the time of her involvement in the Cell, Jarrilyn was in her middle years, but was still considered pretty, and had dirty blonde hair that she wore in a ponytail.<ref name=\"MW\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[MidWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[UnderWorld]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Members of the Cell]]"}}}]}}}}
