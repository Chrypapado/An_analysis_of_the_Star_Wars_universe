He shames me in death as he shamed me in life.|Naman Fal explaining about his son.|audio=NamanFal-Son-TOR.ogg|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nDuring the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], Fal took [[Naman Fal's son|his son]] to the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]] on [[Korriban]] where he could be trained as [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. However, his son was weak in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and would never have the talent in becoming a Sith since he was compassionate, kind, and talkative. The son really wanted to prove to him that he would be a Sith and make him proud. While Naman was tasked to stay on guard in front of the Dark Council Chamber, his son traveled to the [[Naga Sadow's tomb|tomb of Naga Sadow]] to recover an ancient relic, only obtainable using a mysterious crystal Naman Fal gave him. Outside the tomb he met a young sentry named [[Yashia]]. The son was in love with her, and the dark side had already faded since he cared about love and compassion towards her. However, this was the last time he would see her since he never made it out of the tomb, and his body was left to rot.\n\nWhen the Sith Acolyte arrived to meet Yashia, she pleaded to the acolyte to find the body and deliver it to Naman Fal. The Sith acolyte was able to locate the body when searching searching the tomb of [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]]. The acolyte and companion took the remains of the acolyte's body back to the academy and meet Naman Fal. When they arrived to meet Naman, the Dark Honor Guardsman told them that this area in the academy was off limits for any Sith Acolyte to enter. Then when the Sith acolyte brought the bad news and showed the remains of Naman Fal's son, Naman Fal felt some sadness in him. He was then forbidden to leave his post under the rule of the Dark Council.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Naman Fal\n|nl=Naman Fal\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fal, Naman}}\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Guardsmen]]\n[[Category:Korriban residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
