He was part of a group that came into conflict with the \"[[Walkway Collective]],\" the survivors near the [[Catier Walkway]], led by [[Tenga Javik]].\n\nSkiffer and his entire group were killed by [[Irek Ismaren|Lord Nyax]]. At the time, Nyax was pursuing [[Yassat]], a scout for the Walkway Collective, but Yassat intentionally led the pursuing monster in Skiffer's direction as a distraction. The last thing Yassat heard of the group was Skiffer's call to action and his dying screams.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Skiffer\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
