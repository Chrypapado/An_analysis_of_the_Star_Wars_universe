Instead of turning her over for prosecution, they offered her a chance to work for them, in a sort of indentured servitude. Naescorcom had been having problems with slicers, so wanted a skilled one on their side. As part of her work, Loa helped set up the security measures in the [[Computer/Legends|computer]] systems of [[Ipsus]]. She was not happy about the situation, and left backdoors in the systems she worked on so that she could gain her revenge later.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tibeeme, Loa}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
