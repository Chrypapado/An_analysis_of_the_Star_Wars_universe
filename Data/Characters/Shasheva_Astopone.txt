The Astopone family became prosperous in the export business, and Shasheva was the heir to the family fortune. She was a patron of the arts, an exotic beauty, and a secret agent of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==Biography==\nShe was recruited by [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]] and used her considerable wealth to fund Rebel spying and smuggling operations on Coruscant. More daringly, she used her position to attend and arrange dinners and glamorous balls with Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moffs]] and admirals, discreetly probing for sensitive information. Her method for sharing this information was to store it on a datadot hidden in her [[firegem]] ring, then hand it to a Rebel contact. She often met her contacts at the [[Coruscant Opera/Legends|Coruscant Opera House]], for which she had a private box.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Astopone, Shasheva}}\n[[Category:Alliance Intelligence members]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
