We have an anomaly here, spaceward from my position, distance unknown, size unknown. Suspect it may be a cloaked capital vessel.|Lieutenant Caregg Oldathan|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\n'''Caregg Oldathan''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]] who was called out of retirement in [[40 ABY]] to fly a [[BTL-S8 K-wing assault starfighter]] against the forces of the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] in the [[Second Galactic Civil War]]. One [[Standard day/Legends|day]], while leading [[Grayfeather Squadron]] in sweeping a quadrant of [[Realspace/Legends|space]] above Commenor, Oldathan discovered a massive [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaked]] [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] headed for his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. With there being nothing that Oldathan's K-wing could do to stop the asteroid, which had broken into multiple chunks of rock, from colliding with Commenor, Oldathan chose to pursue fleeing Galactic Alliance [[Starship/Legends|starships]] that had cloaked the asteroid to prevent them from using the trick again.\n\n==Biography==\n===Called out of retirement===\n{{Quote|Grayfeather Squadron, report.''\"<br />\"''Grayfeather One here.''\"<br />\"''Divert to heading one-eight-oh immediately.

In response,<ref name=\"Fury\" /> the [[Commenorian Navy]]<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> called Oldathan out of retirement, and he held the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] in command of the K-wing [[Grayfeather Squadron]]. The Galactic Alliance began dispatching a constant stream of units to [[Battle of Commenor (Second Galactic Civil War)|engage]] Commenor's [[Planet/Legends|planetary]] defenses to prevent them from lending their strength to the Confederate war effort. Due to the persistent attacks, Oldathan and his K-wing were unable to get their respective valuable rest and maintenance, and Grayfeather Squadron was reduced to a total of five K-wings.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nWith another [[Standard day/Legends|day]] yielding another attack upon Commenor, Oldathan led Grayfeather Squadron as [[Grayfeather One]] against the [[Galactic Alliance Third Fleet]]. Lieutenant [[Danen]] served as his bombardier-[[Gunner/Legends|gunner]] for the mission, and his K-wing was armed with [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missiles]] instead of [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton torpedos]], as the latter were in short supply for Commenor. However, at about one [[Standard minute/Legends|minute]] to contact with the opposing forces, Oldathan and Grayfeather Squadron were diverted to investigate a potential unidentified vehicle on the night side of Commenor, a couple of thousand [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]] away from their current location. When Grayfeather Squadron made it to the target area, all it found was a Commenori [[Courier/Legends|courier]] [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] trying to escape past Galactic Alliance forces. Though there was no apparent Galactic Alliance threat in the area, Oldathan had the [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] search the surrounding [[Realspace/Legends|space]] using spiraling patterns, with Oldathan and Danen searching alone while the remaining four K-wings broke into wing pairs.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n===Discovering a cloaked asteroid===\n{{Quote|Grayfeathers, join me here. Primary target is the vehicle with the balloon-shaped prow, which I'm assuming is the cloaking mechanism. Secondary is the shuttle. All others insignificant.|Caregg Oldathan leads Grayfeather Squadron against the Galactic Alliance starships responsible for cloaking the asteroid|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\n[[File:K-Wing_NEGVV.png|thumb|right|225px|Caregg Oldathan flew a BTL-S8 K-wing assault starfighter.]]\nWhile searching, Danen reported seeing a [[Star/Legends|star]] disappear momentarily from the [[Jeweled Lizard]] [[Constellation/Legends|constellation]], and when Oldathan also saw it and then observed another star in the Jeweled Lizard disappear and reappear, he suspected that they were seeing a [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaked]] [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ship]] blocking their view of the stars as it moved. He reported the anomaly to [[Starfighter Control]], and Grayfeather Squadron was promised reinforcements to deal with the new threat, though any that came would be aging reserve squadrons. Using the other Grayfeather Squadron K-wings' reports of the anomaly to triangulate and locate its position, Oldathan took his starfighter near to the cloaked object, and the crew of Grayfeather One approximated a diameter of at least thirty-to-forty-thousand kilometers. Oldathan relayed to Starfighter Control that the cloaked object heading for Commenor was [[meteor]]-sized, and he was cleared to fire upon it.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nOldathan had Danen launch two concussion [[Missile/Legends|missiles]], and the cloak was lifted from the object shortly after the [[Warhead/Legends|warheads]] impacted, revealing a [[nickel]]-[[Iron/Legends|iron]] [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] with a mass of millions of [[Metric ton/Legends|tons]]. Just then, a [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] with a cloaking device on its nose departed the asteroid, followed by a host of smaller [[Starship/Legends|starships]]. Before Grayfeather One could do anything, the asteroid broke into dozens of smaller pieces, all headed for Commenor. Realizing that his K-wing was incapable of stopping the asteroid chunks aimed at his homeworld, Oldathan informed Starfighter Control of the impending danger. He and Danen then went to engage the frigate with the cloaking device alone, hoping to delay the enemy vessels' exit so that the rest of Grayfeather Squadron could arrive to destroy the frigate and prevent the cloaking technique from being used again. In the end, Commenori forces failed to stop the asteroid shards, which impacted the planet's population centers with the force of [[City/Legends|city]]-buster bombs.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Hey, Danen.''\"<br />\"''Yeah.''\"<br />\"''Good working with you.''\"<br />\"''Yeah. You, too.|Caregg Oldathan and Danen prepare to assault the frigate|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nCaregg Oldathan understood that the Galactic Alliance's attacks upon Commenor were meant to wear down Commenori forces to prevent them from aiding the Confederation, and he had a good enough understanding of cloaking devices to recognize the use of one when he saw the signs. When Grayfeather Squadron was diverted from the fighting above Commenor to look for a starship, Oldathan was impatient to get back, as leaving the battle zone made him feel like he was running away. Oldathan was disturbed by signs that both sides of the Second Galactic Civil War were ignoring some parts of the interplanetary rules of war, and rumors of Commenori entertaining themselves with [[Blood/Legends|bloodsports]] bothered him.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nWhen the asteroid headed for Commenor revealed itself and broke into smaller fragments, Oldathan realized that there was nothing he or even Commenor itself could do to stop it from impacting with the planet. Instead of firing fruitlessly on the massive chunks of asteroid, he chose instead to engage the fleeing frigate to buy the rest of his squadron enough time to reach the enemy ship and destroy it, knowing that he and Danen would most likely [[Death/Legends|die]] in the attempt.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCaregg Oldathan's only appearance was in ''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'', a [[2007]] novel by [[Aaron Allston]]. The pilot was later mentioned in Grayfeather Squadron's entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', released in [[2008]]. Oldathan's [[Species/Legends|species]] was not identified in the aforementioned sources.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CSWECite|I||Grayfeather Squadron}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oldathan, Caregg}}\n[[Category:Commenori]]\n[[Category:Confederation military personnel]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
