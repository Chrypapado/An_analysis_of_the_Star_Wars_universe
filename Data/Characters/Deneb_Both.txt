She made her home on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and frequented [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Cantina]]. Deneb was hoping to leave Tatooine and was often found at the Cantina during [[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena's]] shift.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[Decipher, Inc.]] used a picture from the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] from the ''Holiday Special'' and replaced the original background. Since only one Ithorian is wearing these clothes, this is Deneb Both. Ammerha was the name used during production, but it was never officially confirmed.{{Fact}}\n\nFor a long time, Deneb Both's [[canon]] name was not known. [[Momaw Nadon/Legends|Momaw Nadon]] was originally going to be named Ammerha.{{Fact}} [http://www.starwarsholidayspecial.com Starwarsholidayspecial.com] used the discarded name to identify this character.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary]]'', Both was mistakenly identified as Momaw Nadon.\n\nDeneb is derived from the word for \"tail\" in arabic; the white supergiant star Deneb is located in the \"tail\" of the constellation Cygnus.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' {{1st}} {{C|as Ammerha}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CCG|set=Tatooine Limited|link=Tatooine-Light/large/denebboth.gif|cardname=Deneb Both}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-holiday-special-cantina-we-may-not-thrive-friend-but-we-survive-friend|text=''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' Cantina: Who's Who|int=The Star Wars Holiday Special Cantina: Who's Who}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2003/08/photoreceptor20030820.html|text=You Come Here Often?}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/03/photoreceptor20040317.html|text=Kiss Me, I'm Ithorian}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Deneb Both#legends\n|nl=Deneb Both\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females|Both, Deneb]]\n[[Category:Ithorians|Both, Deneb]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians|Both, Deneb]]"}}}]}}}}
