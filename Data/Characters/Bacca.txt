Bacca was his name, and he is greatly revered.|Freyyr, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Bacca''', often remembered as the '''Great Bacca''', was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] from [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] who lived [[Standard century/Legends|centuries]] prior to the [[Old Sith Wars]] era. He was famed for crafting [[Bacca's Ceremonial Blade|a ceremonial sword]] that came to symbolize leadership among his people. Many centuries after his death, Bacca's lineage was still alive through [[Attichitcuk's family|the family]] of [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]] and his son [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|Bacca found a crashed starship, our first hint of life elsewhere.|Freyyr, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nThe [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] known as Bacca was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] several [[Standard century/Legends|centuries]] before the [[Old Sith Wars]]. He originated from [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of his people, and his name meant into as \"ally\" or \"friend\" in [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]], the main Wookiee [[Language/Legends|language]]. At some point when Bacca had already grown old, he discovered a crashed [[Starship/Legends|starship]] during an expedition in the [[Shadowlands/Legends|Nother World]]. That encounter marked the first time a Wookiee realized that life existed outside of Kashyyyk. Bacca scavenged metallic debris from the wreckage and used it to craft a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]]. That weapon, which came to be known as [[Bacca's Ceremonial Blade]], became the symbol of Wookiee independence. Bacca himself rose to become the first great [[Wookiee Chieftain]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quotetrans|Yes, son. By the blade of Bacca's sword, I've come to end your treachery! No more will you sell your own people!|Freyyr, to Chuundar|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nFollowing Bacca's [[Death/Legends|death]], his Ceremonial Blade was passed down from chieftain to chieftain as a symbol of leadership. At some point, Bacca's descendant [[Rothrrrawr]] raided the Nother World, hoping to defeat a vicious [[Terentatek/Legends|terentatek]] called the [[Great Beast]] in a ritual combat. However, the ambitious warrior only managed to wound the beast, breaking off the blade inside the creature's hide. He fled only with the hilt of the blade, which continued to be passed down through the generations. A generation later, in [[3956 BBY]], the blade was finally recovered by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and put back together with its handle.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nThe name of Bacca was also carried with many Wookiees after him, marking them as descendants of his prestigious lineage. Those individuals included members of [[Attichitcuk's family]] such as [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]<ref name=\"TCWUKC6.19\">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.19]]''</ref> and his nephew [[Lowbacca]],<ref name=\"FF\">{{FFCite|74}}</ref> and others like [[Kybacca]]<ref name=\"SWE\">''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''; {{C|\"''Kybacca''\"}} p.172</ref> and [[Weebacca]].<ref name=\"GB\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.19]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box|\n|title=[[Wookiee Chieftain]]\n|years=unknown\n|before=none\n|after=[[Rothrrrawr]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bacca\n|fi=Bacca\n|ru=\u0411\u0430\u043a\u043a\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Wookiee Chieftains]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
