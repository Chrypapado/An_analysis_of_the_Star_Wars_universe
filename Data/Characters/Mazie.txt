She befriended [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and made it her business to relieve the discomforts of (and dangers to) her fellow slaves. Mazie helped Skywalker to persuade the slaves to revolt against Krayn, resulting ultimately in their freedom.\n\nIronically, Mazie and her family had moved to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] from [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] in [[39 BBY/Legends|39 BBY]], in order to avoid slavery, only to be seized and cast into slavery later by Krayn. Mazie's destiny was a sad one, however, as she later died in a tragic shootout.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Jedi Quest 3|''Jedi Quest'' 3]]\n*[[Jedi Quest 4|''Jedi Quest'' 4]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mazie\n|nl=Mazie\n|pl=Mazie\n|ru=\u041c\u044d\u0439\u0437\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
