These are mostly plants I've encountered in youth when I was more of a traveller.

Cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Hotbe resided in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] where he created four works of art, titled [[Blumbush (painting)|''Blumbush'']], ''[[Boffa Plant]]'', ''[[Mattberry Plant]]'', and ''[[Ronka Plant]]''. All of these [[Painting/Legends|paintings]] were subsequently featured in the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]] by curator [[Lilas Dinhint]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Tell me where to find Vanvi Hotne.\"<br />\"Look for a small square near the Lucky Despot, and you'll find Vanvi Hotne in that area.|A spacer and Lilas Dinhint|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] by the name of Vanvi Hotne lived during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a major conflict between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. In his youth, Hotne encountered many different kinds of [[Plant/Legends|plants]] during his travels. These plants later served as an inspiration for him to become an [[Artist/Legends|artist]] who created accurate depictions of these subjects. By the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"Ruins\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine]]''</ref> Hotne set up shop in a small square next to the ''[[Lucky Despot]]'' [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]] and [[Casino/Legends|casino]] in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], a [[City/Legends|city]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. As he was overdue on his rent, Hotne was on edge about being approached by debt collectors. He had few [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to his name, and sought to create [[Painting/Legends|paintings]] as a way to make a living. He created four such paintings during his time in Mos Eisley, titled [[Blumbush (painting)|''Blumbush'']], ''[[Boffa Plant]]'', ''[[Mattberry Plant]]'', and ''[[Ronka Plant]]''.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], curator [[Lilas Dinhint]] oversaw the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> which served as the planet's only [[Museum/Legends|museum]].<ref name=\"Eisley\">''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''</ref> Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Vanvi Hotne was one of the artists to be considered, along with [[Giaal Itotr]], [[Klepa Laeel]], [[Kahfr Oladi]], [[Boulo Siesi]], and [[Kolka Zteht/Legends|Kolka Zteht]]. In order to have his paintings featured in Bestine, however, Hotne required enough votes to win over his fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty [[Standard day/Legends|days]], allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the course of his artistry career, Hotne was approached by a number of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], many of whom voted for him as their artist of choice. Hotne won the art competitions at various times, allowing him the opportunity to display his paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time his paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. This allowed the opportunity for [[Architect/Legends|architecturally-inclined]] furniture makers and [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] to mass-produce copies of Hotne's paintings so that they could be purchased, [[Collector/Legends|collected]], or displayed for personal use. With his paintings now on display in Bestine, Hotne believed his windfall would follow shortly thereafter, and that he would be able to make good on his debts.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Are you from the debt collector?

In his youth, Hotne was an [[Scout/Legends|explorer]] who traveled [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], admiring its many forms of plantlife. In later life, Hotne was on edge about being approached by debt collectors, as he was overdue on his rent. Hotne was liable to act hostile towards any passersby who approached him, believing them to be potential collectors. However, his anxieties were put more at ease once his paintings were put on display in Bestine, as he believed this newfound success would put an end to his financial woes.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|Are you here to collect a debt?
