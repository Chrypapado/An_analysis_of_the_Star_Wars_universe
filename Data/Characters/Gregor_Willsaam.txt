A few years after the [[Treaty of Coruscant]], Gregor's daughter was revealed to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|force-sensitive]] and was elected by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Nomen Karr]] to serve as his apprentice of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. His daughter was very valuable to the Jedi Order due to her unique ability to recognize the true nature of every person. However, Gregor and his wife hoped that their daughter would be married to the [[House of Organa/Legends|House Organa]], so they could be free from being mere servants.\n\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nDuring the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Baras]], whose espionage network was threatened by Jaesa, sent his [[Empire's Wrath|apprentice]] to eliminate Jaesa's parents in order to lure Jaesa out of hiding. The apprentice followed various clues and followed them to [[Gesselle Organa]]'s castle, Gregor and Parvin the parents were under the protection of the Jedi Master [[Volryder]].\n\nWhen Volryder prepared to engage the [[Sith Warrior]], Gregor, despite the objections of the Jedi, wanted to find out the reason for this intrusion. The apprentice only needed the Willsaams in order to send a message to Jaesa. Gregor pleaded the Sith Warrior to spare him and his wife, but the apprentice killed them anyway.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Sith Warrior has two options. In the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] option, he/she would convince the parents to join the Empire and spare them, and letting Volryder leave; that way, if the Sith Warrior would tell Darth Baras of his/her sending the parents to him, the option of torture or letting them bask in Imperial luxury would tip Jaesa off-balance. In the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] option, the Warrior kills them and faces Volryder.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gregor Willsaam\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Willsaam, Gregor}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
