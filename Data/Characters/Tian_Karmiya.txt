Karmiya studied at the [[Carida Academy]], where she received prime marks. However, she was rumored to have reported two students with better grades for selling their exam answers, resulting in their expulsion, while she was rewarded with a place in a merit society. Following the academy, Karmiya served aboard the [[Enigma (Galactic Empire)|''Enigma'']] and ''[[Victory at Batonn]]'' with fine service. Karmiya eventually obtained the [[military rank]] of [[commander]], and served as [[executive officer]] aboard the ''[[Ultimatum]]'' of [[Death Squadron]].<ref name=\"Final Order\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Final Order|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}} {{1st|[[From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back (audiobook)|''From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back (audiobook)|''From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karmiya, Tian}}\n[[Category:Commission for the Preservation of the New Order personnel]]\n[[Category:Death Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Executive officers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ilohians]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
