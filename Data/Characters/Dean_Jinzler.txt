I'm an electronics technician. Like my father before me.|Dean Jinzler to Jorad Pressor|Survivor's Quest}}\n'''Dean Jinzler''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] and the youngest of the four [[Jinzler family|Jinzler children]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Just tell him that his sister was thinking about him, hoping that someday he'll be able to let go of his anger.|Lorana Jinzler|Outbound Flight (novel)}}\nAs a young child, Dean loathed his elder sister, [[Lorana Jinzler|Lorana]]. Lorana was a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], and Dean's parents were truly proud of her, causing Dean to feel jealous and unloved. In actuality, his parents offered him the same love and encouragement as they gave Lorana, but Dean blocked this out and created a false belief that grew with him over the years. Lorana and Dean parted on bad terms, just before Lorana embarked upon the ill-fated [[Outbound Flight Project|Outbound Flight]] mission, which led to her [[Death/Legends|death]].\n\nLike his father, Dean trained as an electronics technician, achieving certificates in comm tech, [[Droid/Legends|droid]] maintenance and [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] tech and working in the [[Senate Support Services]]. Dean traveled [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] frequently during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], spending a brief time in the [[Hadar sector/Legends|Hadar sector]] following the Wars, during which he learned an ingenious trick for exterminating infestations of [[Conduit worm/Legends|conduit worms]].\n\nTwo years after the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] and the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] signed their historic peace treaty, Dean joined [[Talon Karrde]]'s operation. Following advice from [[Jorj Car'das]], Dean transferred to the [[Comra/Legends|Comra]] listening station, where he intercepted a transmission coming from [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]], for the attention of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]]. The [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] had located the wreckage of Outbound Flight, and Dean, masquerading as a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] Ambassador, joined the expedition. During the mission, Dean came to terms with the lie he'd been living over the past sixty years, finally accepting himself for who he was. After the mission, Dean retired to the [[Empire of the Hand]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|'' Outbound Flight'']]\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dean Jinzler\n|ja=\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30f3\u30ba\u30e9\u30fc\n|pl=Dean Jinzler\n|fi=Dean Jinzler\n|deFA=1\n|ru=\u0414\u0438\u043d \u0414\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jinzler, Dean}}\n[[Category:Car'das members]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Empire of the Hand citizens]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers' Alliance members]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]"}}}]}}}}
