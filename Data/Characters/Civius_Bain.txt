After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], the young man got indebted to the [[Spice/Legends|spice]] smugglers [[Jaryn Minoze]] and [[Oret Sturm]], two members of the [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] smuggling ring of the [[Chirq Council]] in [[Kor Vella/Legends|Kor Vella]]. Civius Bain was forced to work for the smugglers in the [[Ryll Smuggler Base]] where they refined their ryll. His mother was desperate and wished for him to leave the smuggling ring and come home.<ref name=\"SWG:SCBftS\" />\n[[File:Ryll_Smuggler_Base.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Ryll Smuggler Base]].]]\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Olivia Bain met a spacer in the [[Vella plains]] and begged to rescue her son. The spacer accepted and headed to the Ryll Smuggler Base. The spacer found Civius Bain in the bunker but the young man explained that he could not leave the smuggling ring since he was still indebted to the smugglers. The spacer therefore killed both Jaryn Minoze and Oret Sturm, allowing Civius to finally escape. After that, Civius Bain decided to start a new life and become an accountant like his father.<ref name=\"SWG:SCBftS\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCivius Bain was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:SCBftS\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Smuggle Civius Bain from the Smugglers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bain, Civius}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Chirq Council]]"}}}]}}}}
