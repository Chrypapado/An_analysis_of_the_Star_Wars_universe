His great-grandfather had been a murderer sent to that world. He was originally a history professor until he lost his job in a government cut of social programs. He was then forced to become a miner. Around [[51 BBY/Legends|51 BBY]], he took command of the terrorist group called [[Desert Wind]]. He enjoyed drinking [[Chandrilan brandy]].\n\nHe remained a leader of Desert Wind up through the [[Battle of Ord Cestus]] around [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]. During the final days of that conflict, he suicide-bombed a [[JK-13 combat droid]] using a mine, crippling it. This sacrifice allowed [[CT-96/298]] to destroy the [[Five Families]] headquarters. At the time of his death he had at least two grandchildren.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Cestus Deception]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cestians|Val Zsing, Thak]]\n[[Category:Educators|Val Zsing, Thak]]\n[[Category:Humans|Val Zsing, Thak]]\n[[Category:Males|Val Zsing, Thak]]\n[[Category:Miners|Val Zsing, Thak]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters|Val Zsing, Thak]]"}}}]}}}}
