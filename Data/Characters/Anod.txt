The younger son of [[King/Legends|King]] [[Lorac]] and [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Denira]], Anod was elevated as a potential [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]]-friendly monarch after an Imperial-engineered [[Great Revolt|coup]] that [[Death/Legends|killed]] Anod's parents and drove his elder brother [[Denid]] into hiding. Denid returned in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]] as Anod was about to be coronated, leading to a succession crisis that resulted in Anod's death.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Recommend my assignment be continued indefinitely, as I have gained the trust of the prince and Regent. Both are little more than provincial fools&mdash;Anod especially so&mdash;and I should have little trouble manipulating them to serve the Empire's needs.|Zeta Traal, in a report to the Imperial Diplomatic Corps|Velmor: Royalty and Rebellion}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Velmor/Legends|Velmor]], Anod was the second son of Velmor's<ref name=\"marvel49\" /> [[King/Legends|King]] [[Lorac]] and [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Denira]], coming of age around the rise of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. In [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]], Imperial agents stirred up a mob that stormed the royal palace, after learning that Lorac had anti-Imperial sympathies. Although Anod was still young, he was already known as an Imperial sympathizer, and Lord Regent [[Zelor]] saved the [[Prince/Legends|prince]]'s life by striking a deal with the Empire where Anod would eventually ascend to the throne as an Imperial-friendly king.<ref name=\"wotc\" /> The king and queen were [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the riot, although Anod's older brother [[Denid]] survived and escaped due to the bravery of the king's advisor, [[Jedidiah]].<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\nAs planned, Anod also survived and remained in the fold,<ref name=\"wotc\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030306velmor|text=Velmor: Royalty and Rebellion|int=Velmor: Royalty and Rebellion|archivedate=20100224213014}}</ref> and Zelor took the throne as the royal regent until such time as Anod had come of age and could take over as Velmor's king.<ref name=\"marvel49\" /> Anod was also constantly shadowed by his personal [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]], [[Ergric Betos]].<ref name=\"wotc\" /> During the coming years, Imperial [[Imperial Diplomatic Corps|diplomatic emissary]] [[Zeta Traal]] also became a fixture of Velmor's court, earning the trust of both Anod and Zelor&mdash;Traal thought little of Anod's will and intellect, and planned to direct him as an Imperial puppet once he became king.<ref name=\"wotc\" />\n\n[[File:AnodDeath.jpg|thumb|left|325px|Anod is killed by Zeta Traal.]]\nAnod was finally set to be coronated in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], but the ceremony was interrupted midway through by the dramatic return of Denid, who arrived on Velmor accompanied by his lover [[Leia Organa Solo|Loren]] and a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Kohl Marcus]]. Denid's arrival on Velmor suddenly threw the succession into question, and after Denid's identity was verified, Traal and Zelor immediately got to work on putting together an alternate plan. In order to keep Anod in line for the throne, the conspirators attempted to hire Marcus to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] Denid and Loren, and planned to kill the hunter afterwards to cover their tracks. However, Zelor had grown accustomed to rule, and had little intention of passing the baton to Anod, plotting to kill the younger prince himself.<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\nNone of these plans came to fruition, as they had made one crucial miscalculation: \"Marcus\" was actually [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and \"Loren\" was actually Rebel leader Leia Organa. When Skywalker refused to carry out the murders while on a [[Mrid Hunt|ceremonial hunt]], Zelor ordered Anod to kill them himself&mdash;Anod got the drop on them and shot both Denid and Organa, although he mistakenly set his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] to stun. Anod turned his gun on Skywalker next, but when Skywalker ignited his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to attack, Traal realized his identity. As Skywalker's capture would be worth an enormous amount to Imperial leadership, Traal turned her own gun on Anod, killing the prince with no hesitation.<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Now listen, Traal, you can't threaten me!
