Apart from being a caretaker, Peckhum also ran supplies to the [[Jedi Praxeum|Jedi Academy]], being one of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] trusted workers. During one of his supply runs, while he was on his way to Coruscant, he met a child named [[Zekk]] and took the young orphan under his wing. They became friends, sharing with one another what they were able to earn or obtain.\n\nIn Peckhum's absence, Zekk would often leave the apartment to explore [[Coruscant underworld|Coruscant's undercity]], where he discovered that he had something of a talent for finding things that were valuable. This talent was hit-and-miss, though. On one occasion Zekk climbed down forty-two stories of an abandoned turbolift shaft to find that what seemed to be a glittering object was actually a piece of foil wrapping stuck to some ooze.\n\nZekk would give the valuable scraps of metal, trinkets, and lost objects that he found to Peckhum, who knew how to sell them and who to sell them to in order to put food on the table. However, the things that Zekk found were collected faster than Peckhum could sell them and as a result, they accumulated inside their apartment.\n\nOn one day in [[23 ABY/Legends|23 ABY]], Peckhum came home from a shift on one of the mirror stations to find Zekk missing. With the help of [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]], he discovered that his friend had left him to become a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] at the [[Shadow Academy]], which orbited Coruscant. Along with Jaina and [[Lowbacca]], he used a solar mirror to burn out the Shadow Academy's [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]], exposing it to the New Republic fleet. However, the station powered its [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] and escaped into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] before the fleet could inflict any significant harm upon it. Though this development caused him quite a bit of despair and alarm, Peckhum took some solace in the fact that Zekk had defied his new teachers so that he could keep a promise made to Peckhum before he had joined the Shadow Academy.\n\n===The Yuuzhan Vong War===\nAfter the Shadow Academy had been defeated and Zekk was redeemed from the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], Peckhum gave Zekk the ''Lightning Rod'' as a gift, and took on ownership of the state-of-the-art ''[[Thunderbolt]]'', a freighter the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] had been trying to give him for years. He continued to run supplies for the Jedi Academy on a regular basis. He also provided supplies to the jungle-confined Imperial pilot [[Qorl]]. His help ended in [[24 ABY/Legends|24 ABY]], when the former pilot asked him not to return. During the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] attack on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] in [[26 ABY]], Peckhum and [[Streen]] were trying to obtain some supplies on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], thus being unable to help with the evacuation of Jedi children.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031023rebel|text=Rebel Jedi|int=Rebel Jedi|archivedate=20100102092341}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Lyric's World]]''\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Promises]]''\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest]]''\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade]]''\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Heirs of the Force]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones]]''\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Jedi Under Siege]]''\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan]]''\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GalaxyCite|8|The Deadly Dozen}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Peckhum\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spacers]]"}}}]}}}}
