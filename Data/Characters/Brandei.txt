As a [[Cadet/Legends|cadet]] from an [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] world, he had to struggle to overcome discrimination; even exemplary work gained him only marginal notice from his professors and superiors. Nonetheless, his academy training&mdash;perhaps on [[Raithal]]{{Fact}}&mdash;imbued him with a definite air of purpose and confidence, and he made his mark in the Imperial military in spite of this initial prejudice.\n\n[[File:Captain-brandei.png|thumb|left|250px|Brandei (right) serving on the [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]]]]\nBrandei spent much of his career aboard the Star Destroyer [[Judicator/Legends|''Judicator'']], assigned to the area of the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] embracing [[Garos IV]]. In [[6 BBY/Legends|6 BBY]], he held the rank of [[Senior Lieutenant/Legends|Senior Lieutenant]], and it was at his suggestion that his old friend [[Tork Winger]], an administrator on Garos IV, adopted a Rebel orphan, the girl later known as [[Alexandra Winger|Alex Winger]].\n\nBy [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Brandei had been transferred aboard the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Dreadnought]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']], where he performed bridge duty as a [[Technical Services Officer]] with the [[Fleet Support Branch]], holding the title of [[Commander/Legends|commander]] and the overall responsibility for the up-keep, maintenance, and combat readiness of the ship's twelve [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE]] squadrons.<ref name=\"Customizable Card Game\"></ref> Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, however, he received notice of a transfer back the ''Judicator'', aboard which he apparently served at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. By [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] believed that he had received a further promotion soon after Endor.\n\nBrandei's assignment as captain of the ''Judicator'' allowed him to renew his acquaintance with the Wingers, but beginning around three years after Endor, he made several further visits to Garos IV with a more driven mission: overseeing the shipment of a Garosian ore for use in Imperial [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]] projects. At around this time, he also made an intense study of what he still regarded as the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]], attempting to understand his enemies in order to defeat them. He came to believe that while Rebels would fight fiercely if they had no other option, they were ultimately driven by an ill-thought-out compassion, often prepared to abandon their mission and their cause to save their immediate friends. Ultimately, he thought, they wanted an easy life, rather than to fight for the greater good, and that understanding this was the key to defeating them.\n\nDuring [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] [[Thrawn campaign|campaign]] against the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], Brandei remained commanding officer of the ''Judicator'' and was part of Thrawn's [[Thrawn's fleet (Galactic Empire)|personal armada]]. He led a successful assault on the planet [[Nkllon/Legends|Nkllon]] in the [[Athega system]], with the objective of capturing [[Plasma-Jet Mole Miner|mole miners]] from [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian's]] [[Nomad City]], though the operation caused extensive damage to the ''Judicator'' that required lengthy repair work. He was also present at the New Republic's discovery of the [[Katana fleet|''Katana'' fleet]]. There, he personally witnessed the destruction of the Star Destroyer ''[[Peremptory]]'' at the 'hands' of a slave-rigged [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|''Dreadnaught''-class cruiser]] when it collided with the Star Destroyer, causing Brandei much anger for which he would later be reprimanded by Thrawn.\n\nFollowing the fragmentation of the Empire that resulted from the final death of [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], Captain Brandei settled his forces on [[Janara III]] and the ''Judicator'' patrolled the sector. In [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]], the Star Destroyer intercepted [[Blue Squadron (New Republic)|Blue Squadron's]] [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing starfighters]] during a routine mission. [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Alexandra Winger]] was captured during the skirmish and conduced to Janara III. The New Republic eventually sent forces to [[Battle of Janara III|rescue her]], forcing Brandei to abandon the planet.<ref name=\"SoG\">{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/fiction/shadesofgray/index.html|text=''Shades of Gray''|int=Shades of Gray|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-shades-of-gray-from-the-adventures-of-alex-winger.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Gamecameo}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|5|Turning Point}}\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]\n*''[[Therefore I Am: The Tale of IG-88]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (junior novelization)|''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' junior novel]]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] {{1st}} {{Ret}}\n*{{Journal|1|A Glimmer of Hope}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=A Glimmer of Hope}}\n*{{Journal|3|Mission to Zila}} {{C|Appears in a dream}}\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{C|First appearance before retcon}}\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]''\n*[[Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)|''Dark Force Rising'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Last Command]]''\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n*[[The Last Command 1|''The Last Command'' 1]] {{Hologram}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/fiction/shadesofgray/index.html|text=''Shades of Gray''|int=Shades of Gray|newurl=http://star-wars.suvudu.com/2012/10/star-wars-shorts-shades-of-gray-from-the-adventures-of-alex-winger.html|newhost=[[Unbound Worlds|Suvudu]]}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|25|Rebel Rumblings}}\n*{{CCG|set=Dagobah Limited|link=Dagobah-Dark/large/commanderbrandei.gif|cardname=Commander Brandei}}\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Brandei\n|es=Brandei\n|hu=Brandei\n|nl=Brandei\n|ru=\u0411\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0439\n|ruGA=1\n}}\n\n[[Category:Death Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mantooinians]]\n[[Category:Thrawn's fleet personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
