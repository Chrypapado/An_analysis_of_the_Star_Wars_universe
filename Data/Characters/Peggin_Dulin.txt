While there, he encountered a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who was tasked with re-assembling an [[R2-series astromech droid]]. The droid was wanted by both [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Arlan Barrezz|Barrezz]] and [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Carh'la Bastra|Bastra]]. The [[Junk dealer/Legends|junk dealer]] [[Watto/Legends|Watto]] had informed the spacer that he had sold the main casing to Peggin. However, Peggin told the spacer that he had discarded the casing when he realized it would not fit in his R2 unit. However, he also told the spacer that he saw some [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] fishing through his trash, and that they may have retrieved the casing. The spacer, using this information, set off to the [[Jawa Mountain Fortress]] to get the missing piece from [[Ji'Ni Sil]].<ref name=\"SWG:BB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPeggin Dulin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:BB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Peggin Dulin was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Legacy Quest|Legacy Quest]]\" with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Body Building}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dulin, Peggin}}\n[[Category:Aqualish]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
