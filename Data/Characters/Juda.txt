She paid a [[Hunter (individual)|bounty hunter]] several times for his bounties. Juda later helped [[Bilikin Drell]] set up an auction on Hutta for the target list of the Great Hunt, but later contacted the Mandalorians after learning what the subject of the auction was. She was then killed for her involvement.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJuda is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' released by [[BioWare]] in [[2011]]. She is voiced by [[Kath Soucie]].\n\nIf the Hunter is male, Juda is one of many flirt options the player can engage in, although it never progresses very far.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Juda\n|it=Juda\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0443\u0434\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
