She flew with distinction throughout the Isard campaign and, with the rest of her squadmates, resigned her commission to wage an insurgency against an Isard-led junta on [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]].\n\nShe became friends with [[Corran Horn]] and later married fellow Rogue [[Nawara Ven]], a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] attorney who joined Rogue Squadron at the same time as she did. She resigned her commission permanently shortly before the resurgence of the Empire under [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]].\n\nDuring [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian's]] [[mission to save Kessel]], Ynr piloted an [[Eta-5 interceptor]] acquired under illicit circumstances in a bid to stop [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] from being destroyed by a mysterious force. She loaned the fighter to [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] during the mission after he expressed an interest in flying it.<ref name=\"FOTJ1\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|14|ROG2, ''X-wing Rogue Squadron''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]]\n|years=[[6 ABY/Legends|6.5 ABY]]\n|before=[[Feylis Ardele]]\n|after=[[Gavin Darklighter]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Rogue Three/Legends|Rogue Three]]\n|years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]]\n|before=[[Nawara Ven]]\n|after=[[Gavin Darklighter]]\n}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Rogue Five/Legends|Rogue Five]]\n|years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]]\n|before=[[Pash Cracken]]\n|after=Eventually [[Tal'dira]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Rhysati Ynr\n|de=Rhysati Ynr\n|hu=Rhysati Ynr\n|fi=Rhysati Ynr\n|pl=Rhysati Ynr\n|ru=\u0420\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0418\u043d\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ynr, Rhysati}}\n[[Category:Antilles's Rogues]]\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Rogue Squadron personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
