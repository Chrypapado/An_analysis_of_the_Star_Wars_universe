His primary opponent during this election was [[Deel Draav]]. Both used foul tactics during the election, but in the end Sheridan lost the ballot, though not by much. According to [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] officer [[Lon Cope]], he took losing the election pretty badly.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTLM\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Sheridan was killed by the [[Chirq Council]], a powerful Corellia-based crime organization. He was shot in the head in [[Hershel Sheridan's house|his own house]] and a [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol/Legends|DL-44 blaster]] was put into his hand to make it look like he had taken his own life. The Chirq Council wanted to kill Mayor Draav and tried to make it look like Sheridian was the culprit.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|CorSec Case Files: The Unlucky Mayor|Corellia}}</ref> They left a scrap paper with his letterhead near a transmitter that had been used to relay threatening messages to Draav. An independent agent investigating the case for Lieutenant Cope found the paper and then discovered Sheridan's body with the blaster in his hand. Sheridan was thought to be the one responsible for the attempted murder and the case was closed.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTLM\" />\n\nHowever Draav was later killed in a second assassination attempt and the case was reopened. Upon re-examining the body, the agent discovered that the blaster didn't have a [[Power pack|power cell]] in it. Further investigations showed that Sheridan was murdered by the Chirq Council and didn't kill Draav.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHershel Sheridan was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment's]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'',<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTLM\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref> His corpse could be found in his house in Kor Vella on Corellia.
