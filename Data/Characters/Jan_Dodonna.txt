You cannot understand the responsibility of high command. It is easy to advise, but the decision is not yours. It is one thing to sacrifice yourself. To sacrifice others is something else entirely&hellip;|Jan Dodonna|Star Wars (2015) 54}}\n'''Jan Dodonna''' was a legendary [[Gender|male]] [[human]] military officer from [[Commenor]] who served with the [[Galactic Republic Navy|navy]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]], within the [[Imperial Navy|navy]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], and later, as a [[general]] in the [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|rebellion against]] the [[Galactic Empire]]. Commanding the [[Massassi Group]], one of the largest cells in [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa's]] [[Bail Organa's resistance movement|resistance movement]], [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|elements]] of his cell were [[Operation Handoff|instrumental]] in the formal formation and declaration of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Dodonna became part of the [[Alliance High Command]], leading the Alliance's [[Sector Command (Alliance)|Sector Command]], as well as the military leader of the Rebel Alliance's [[Great Temple|hidden fortress]] on [[Yavin 4]]. In this capacity, he formulated the plan that led to the successful [[Battle of Yavin]] and the destruction of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]].\n\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Dodonna along his fellow Rebels [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuated]] from Yavin 4 in search of a new base of operations. He then joined the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] and helped to rest of the Alliance High Command to oversee the war effort. A year later, Dodonna was stationed at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]] along with the remainder of the High Command and Alliance Fleet, where he was commanded the [[MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser|MC80A ''Home One'' Type Heavy Star Cruiser]] [[Republic (MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser)|''Republic'']]. However, [[Assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks|an attack]] by the Empire's [[Death Squadron]] ensued following [[Queen]] [[Trios]]' betrayal, which had devastating consequences for the Alliance. Not desiring to risk any more lives, Dodonna ordered the ''Republic'' to remain hidden, but [[Luke Skywalker]] convinced him to return to Mako-Ta and rescue the surviving rebel forces. Ultimately, Dodonna gave his life to ensure the survival of the remaining elements of the Alliance Fleet and the survivors of Alliance High Command when the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]''{{'s}} [[turbolaser]]s destroyed the ''Republic''.<ref name=\"SW 55\">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref>\n\nDodonna's [[death]] wasn't in vain, however. Thanks to his sacrifice, members of the High Command including [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] [[Mon Mothma]], [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]] with ''[[Home One]]'', General [[Hera Syndulla]] with the [[Geist (cruiser)|''Geist'']], and [[Commander]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] managed to survive, and they continued to fight for justice and to restore the Republic. Eventually, the Alliance Fleet led by Ackbar participated in the [[Battle of Endor]], resulting in the first [[death]] of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] along with the destruction of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], and eventually the collapse of the Empire itself during the [[Battle of Jakku]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Service in the Republic and the Empire===\nA [[human]] [[Gender|male]] from the [[planet]] [[Commenor]],<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> Jan Dodonna served in the [[Galactic Republic Navy|naval forces]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] during the conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]], where he served as a bridge officer on a [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]].<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" /> After the Republic's [[Proclamation of the New Order|transition]] into the [[Galactic Empire]], Dodonna continued his service into the [[Imperial Navy]], where, for outstanding service, he became one of the first [[captain]]s of an Imperial [[Star Destroyer]].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> However, as time went on, Dodonna would become disillusioned with the Empire, and, soon after, he defected to the growing rebellion.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" />\n\n===Early rebellion===\n{{Quote|We have orders to deliver these bombers to General Dodonna's unit.

By [[5 BBY]], Dodonna had risen to command one of these teams of rebels, the [[Massassi Group]], in his fight [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|against]] the Empire. [[Leevan Tenza]] was a member of this group, however an incident where he disobeyed orders and preemptively engaged an Imperial target led to his [[court-martial]] and defection to [[Saw Gerrera]]'s [[Partisans]].<ref name=\"Visual Guide\" />\n\n[[File:Jan_Dodonna_Secret_Cargo.png|thumb|left|250px|General Dodonna and Senator Organa listen to Mon Mothma's speech]]\nBy [[2 BBY]],{{Fact}} Dodonna commanded one of the largest rebel cells in the entire rebellion, based on [[Yavin 4]], the fourth [[moon]] of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], in the [[Gordian Reach]].<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref> In this [[Standard year|year]], [[Spectres|elements]] of [[Phoenix Cell]], which also operated as part of the rebel network, managed to [[Mission to Reklam Station|steal]] five antiquated [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber]]s from an Imperial [[Reklam Station|salvage yard]] in order to deliver them to Dodonna and his unit.<ref name=\"Steps\" /> The Y-wings eventually made their way to the group's starfighter auxiliary, [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]],<ref name=\"Trivia Gallery\">{{SW|url=episodes/steps-into-shadow-trivia-gallery|text=Steps Into Shadow Trivia Gallery}} {{C|Slide 12}}</ref><ref name=\"Y-wing note\">In ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]'' it's said that the [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wings]] [[Mission to Reklam Station|liberated]] by [[Phoenix Squadron]] are for Jan Dodonna's unit.

Later, General Dodonna along with Senator Bail Organa and several rebel personnel listened to a live [[HoloNet]] broadcast by the former Senator denouncing the Empire and urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion, which eventually led to the formation of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n====Atollon====\n{{Quote|This day has been a long time coming. Hopefully we can finally deal a blow to the Empire and show the rest of the galaxy what we're capable of.|General Jan Dodonna, to Commander Jun Sato|Zero Hour}}\nUnder the new Rebel Alliance, Dodonna and his Massassi Group were paired with [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]]'s Phoenix Squadron in preparation for a strike on the capital world of the [[Lothal sector]], [[Lothal]]. However, before the attack could take place, the rebels were [[Battle of Atollon|ambushed]] by the [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] under [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]], or Thrawn, a fearsome tactician responsible for the destruction of several rebel cells in the past, who was also intent on capturing Dodonna as well as the rest of the [[Alliance officer|high-ranking rebels]] gathered on the planet.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n[[File:DodonnaRebels.jpg|thumb|right|250px|General Dodonna during Grand Admiral Thrawn's ambush on Atollon.]]\nThrawn, along with [[Admiral]] [[Kassius Konstantine]] and his [[Interdictor vessel]]s, initially laid waste to both Dodonna's and Sato's forces, and the latter was forced to sacrifice himself in an attempt to enable [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[C1-10P|Chopper]] to escape on the [[Nightbrother (Gauntlet fighter)|''Nightbrother'']] and seek help. Sustaining heavy losses, Dodonna and the rest of the fleet were forced to withdraw back to [[Chopper Base]], under the protection of a [[deflector shield]]. The deflector shield weathered Thrawn's orbital bombardment but the Grand Admiral launched a ground assault with [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walkers]], [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]], and [[stormtrooper]]s.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nWhile planning the defense of Chopper Base, General Dodonna predicted that Thrawn would deploy his forces through the narrow canyon leading to Chopper Base. Captain [[Rex]] then proposed ambushing the Imperial forces along that route. Despite destroying several AT-DP walkers, the rebels were unable to stop Thrawn's AT-ATs and stormtroopers from storming the base. As the rebel ships departed, Dodonna, Syndulla's Spectres crew, and the [[RA-7 protocol droid]] [[AP-5]] attempted to flee aboard the ''Ghost'' but were surrounded by Thrawn and his troops. Before Thrawn could captured them, a mysterious Force entity known as the [[Bendu]] attacked the base with lightning.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nDodonna and the other rebels were able to flee aboard the ''Ghost''. Weathering the thunderstorm, the rebel convoy reached space. By that stage, Ezra had arrived with [[Clan Wren]] reinforcements who destroyed the remaining Interdictor, allowing Dodonna and his remaining forces to escape. The rebel convoy then traveled to Yavin 4.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n====Road to war====\nAround [[1 BBY]],<ref name=\"Chronology Note\">The trivia guide for ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore]]'' states that [[Bo-Katan Kryze]] was redesigned to advance the character's age by \"18 [[Standard year|years]] or so\".

As [[In the Name of the Rebellion]] takes place shortly after ''Heroes of Mandalore'', it can be assumed it is also around the [[Standard year|year]] 1 [[Galactic standard calendar|BBY]].</ref> General Dodonna attended a briefing of the [[Alliance High Command|rebel leadership]] and the Spectres to discuss the [[Jalindi Station]], which the Empire was using to disrupt Alliance supply runs. During the meeting, Dodonna admitted that the Partisan leader Saw Gerrera's intelligence had been right despite disapproving of the latter's ruthless methods. During the meeting, the Alliance leadership approved of a plan by the Spectres to travel aboard the ''Ghost'' to Jalindi and plant a spike on the relay for intelligence gathering. When Dodonna asked if the ''Ghost'' was suitable for the mission, [[Hera Syndulla]] replied that her ship was up to scratch.<ref name=\"INR\">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref>\n\nAfter Hera and Chopper returned from Lothal with the [[TIE/D Defender Elite]]'s [[flight data recorder]], Dodonna attended a high-level briefing with Hera, Mothma, Organa, and [[Erskin Semaj]]. After analyzing the data, Dodonna surmised that the Alliance's starfighters were no match for the TIE/D Defender Elite. While Dodonna and the others were debating why the Empire had activated [[Protocol 13]] on Lothal, Hera interrupted the meeting and convinced Mothma to launch a [[Attack on Lothal|strike]] against the TIE Defender factories on Lothal.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Stealing the Death Star plans====\n{{Quote|&hellip;man your ships, and may the Force be with you.|General Dodonna, before the Battle of Yavin|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n[[File:JanDodonna-SWCT.png|thumb|left|200px|Dodonna during Rogue One's mission to steal the Death Star plans]]\nBy [[0 BBY]], the [[general]] commanded the [[Great Temple]], which was the main rebel headquarters, considered its most important base and \"hidden fortress\" from the Empire.<ref name=\"SWE\" /> By this point, Dodonna had been elevated to Alliance High Command, and was present at the headquarters as [[Operation Fracture]] confirmed the existence of an Imperial mobile [[battle station]] [[superweapon]] capable of destroying entire planets, known as the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. Although High Command was divided in their response to the threat, the squad [[Rogue One]] launched an unauthorized mission to steal the [[Death Star plans|plans]] in hope of discovering a weakness that would allow the Alliance to destroy the station. The resulting [[Battle of Scarif]] resulted in the outbreak of the [[Galactic Civil War]] and open warfare against the Empire, and the plans would be successfully retrieved from the [[Scarif]] [[Citadel Tower]] in an attempt to return them to Dodonna for analysis.<ref name=\"Rogue One\">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Doctor_Aphra_13_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|200px|Dodonna directs the Rebel attack during the Battle of Yavin.]]\nAfter the plans made their way to the headquarters and the weakness installed in the battle station by Galen Erso was found,<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> Dodonna designed an attack strategy that would set a group of [[starfighter]]s into battle against the Death Star with the mission to [[fire]] [[proton torpedo]]es into the station's [[Thermal exhaust port|exhaust port]] and destroy it. This led to the [[Battle of Yavin]], which Dodonna and other Rebel leaders monitored from Yavin 4. Just as the Death Star came into range to destroy Yavin 4, and Dodonna with it, the station was destroyed by [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n====Evacuating Yavin====\n{{Quote|...The Empire now knows our location.

The General refused her offer, reporting that a [[bounty]] of 10,000,000 [[credit]]s had been placed on her head by the Empire and reported rumors that the Imperials were seeking out surviving [[Alderaanian]]s for reprisal. Dodonna demanded that the Princess not leave the [[Star system|system]] with anything less than a full military escort before dismissing her.<ref name=\"Princess Leia 1\" />\n\nDespite Dodonna's objections, Organa departed the [[jungle]] moon in [[Jan Dodonna's T-1 shuttle|a]] [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|T-1 shuttle]] operated by [[R2-D2]] and [[Evaan Verlaine]], an Alderaanian [[pilot]]. Leia left a [[hologram]] explaining her actions in Dodonna's private quarters, which contained luxury furniture and a balcony overlooking the jungle canopy below. The General dispatched Luke Skywalker and [[Wedge Antilles]] in [[X-wing starfighter]]s to retrieve the wayward princess; however, the shuttle jumped to [[hyperspace]] before Skywalker and Antilles could stop them.<ref name=\"Princess Leia 1\" />\n\n====Serving the Rebel fleet====\nFollowing the evacuation of Yavin 4, Dodonna joined the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] and helped the rest of the Alliance's leaders oversee the war effort. Shortly after the [[Assault on Cymoon|assault]] on the Empire's [[Weapons Factory Alpha]] on [[Cymoon 1]], Dodonna met with Princess Leia, [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] Mon Mothma, and Admiral [[Gial Ackbar]] to discuss the Alliance's next steps and the need to find a new base of operations.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\n====Message from R2-D2====\nSeveral [[Standard day|days]] later, the Rebel fleet received an [[Distress signal|distress call]] from R2-D2, Skywalker's [[astromech droid]]. The [[droid]] reported that Skywalker had been captured by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the [[Hutt]], a powerful [[crime lord]] on [[Nar Shaddaa]]. Dodonna met with Mon Mothma and Ackbar to discuss the situation, and expressed his confusion as to why Skywalker had been on the crime-ridden moon of Nar Shaddaa in the first place. Ackbar proposed that they rescue the Rebel hero, but Mon Mothma noted that they could not make a move against the powerful [[Hutt Clan|Hutt Cartels]], and that no one would be brave enough to volunteer for a covert rescue mission. The meeting was then interrupted by [[Chewbacca]], and Dodonna noted that he seemed to be willing to do so alongside the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 9\">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref> Chewbacca successfully [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|rescued]] Skywalker with the help of Princess Leia and [[Han Solo]], who had learned of Skywalker's situation and went to his aid.<ref name=\"Star Wars 12\">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>\n\n====Capturing Darth Vader====\nAlliance High Command soon received word that the Rebel garrison on [[Vrogas Vas]] had [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|engaged]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and shot his [[Darth Vader's TIE Advanced|starfighter]] down after taking heavy casualties. Dodonna decided that [[Darth]] Vader represented a significant threat and target of opportunity, and dispatched a [[battalion]] to reinforce the Rebels on planet in their effort to [[Death|kill]] the [[Sith Lord]].<ref name=\"Vader Down 1\">[[Vader Down 1|''Vader Down'' 1]]</ref>\n\n====Mako-Ta Space Docks====\nAfter the destruction of the first [[Death Star]], General Dodonna was stationed at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]] along with the remainder of Alliance High command. It was from this station that the Alliance orchestrated the Mutiny of Mon Cala. The newly strengthened Rebel fleet was gathered at Mako-Ta. Dodonna was given command of the [[MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser|MC80A ''Home One'' Type Heavy Star Cruiser]] [[Republic (MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser)|''Republic'']].{{Fact}}\n\n====Final battle====\nThe Alliance's safety at Mako-Ta was short-lived, as [[Trios|Queen Trios]], who had been leaking information to both the Empire and the Rebels, revealed to Darth Vader the location of the Rebel's hidden base. The Empire arrived with three [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer]]s and one [[Super Star Destroyer]], the ''[[Executor]]'', led by Vader himself. When the Rebels attempted to flee, it was discovered that the [[Shu-Torun]] technologies installed in the Mon Calamari cruisers rendered nearly all systems inoperable, including the hangar bays and hyperdrive generators. Without power or the ability to deploy fighters, the Imperial forces, vastly superior in numbers and firepower, quickly gained the upper hand in the attack.<ref name=\"SW 55\" />\n\nIt was hypothesized by [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] that a failsafe in the hangar bay doors would detect a transponder operating on rebel frequencies flying at the doors at high speed. This was confirmed when Skywalker, who was also stationed aboard Dodonna's cruiser, flew close to the ''Republic's'' hangar doors, despite General Dodonna's direct order to remain grounded. However, the doors opened, allowing the ship's contingent of X-wing fighters to be deployed.<ref name=\"SW 55\" />\n\nDuring the battle, rebel operatives led by General [[Davits Draven]], were able to secure access codes that would allow the Shu-Torun technologies to be overridden. These codes were delivered to General Dodonna, who promptly ordered the ''Republic'' to escape into hyperspace. Not wishing to risk any more lives than were already lost in the devastating attack, General Dodonna ordered the ''Republic'' to stay hidden and wait to regroup with any survivors. He was convinced, however by Skywalker and Organa, that it would be best to return to Mako-Ta in order to rescue those who were stranded.<ref name=\"SW 55\" />\n\nAlong with a handful of small transports escorted by [[Rogue Squadron]], the ''Republic'' returned to Mako-Ta station and engaged the ''Executor''. Dodonna's forces were able to hold the Empire at bay long enough to distribute the access codes to the other stranded Mon Calamari cruisers while the inhabitants of the space station were evacuated onto the transports. The ''Republic'' was shortly destroyed by turbolaser fire from the ''Executor''. Jan Dodonna, General of the Rebel Alliance, was lost with his ship.<ref name=\"SW 55\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nThough it cost him his life, Dodonna's actions were instrumental in saving the future of the Alliance. Mothma, Ackbar, Syndulla, and many others of Alliance High command were among those saved by the ''Republic''{{'s}} return to the battle.<ref name=\"SW 55\" /> His leadership during the early days of a growing Rebellion, during the Battle of Yavin, and at his final stand during the ambush at Mako-Ta allowed the Alliance to thrive and eventually defeat the Emperor at the [[Battle of Endor]] years after his death.<ref name=\"Episode VI\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|General Dodonna is known for his courage.

However, after talking with Luke Skywalker, Dodonna opted to return and help and the ones stranded there and ultimately sacrificed his own life to ensure the Alliance's survival and allow his fellow rebels to live to fight another day.<ref name=\"SW 55\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJan Dodonna was played by [[Alex McCrindle]] in the [[1977]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope]]'', the first installment of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[original trilogy]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Dodonna later appeared in the [[2016]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'', where he was portrayed by [[Ian McElhinney]].<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> He was voiced by [[Michael Bell]] in four episodes of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nIn [[George Lucas]]' [[The Star Wars: First Draft|first draft]] for ''A New Hope'', a [[Sith]] knight character known as \"[[Espaa Valorum|Valorum]]\" was renamed \"Dodona,\" as Lucas considered, in that draft alone, renaming the [[Skywalker family|Starkiller family]] to the \"Valor\" family, thus the names conflicted. \"Dodona\" was one of the few names in that draft that reappeared in the [[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars|second draft]], when it was definitively assigned to a Rebel general on Yavin 4, thus creating the character of Jan Dodonna.<ref name=\"The Making of Star Wars\">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>\n\nOriginally, Dodonna was still alive post-[[Hoth]] as ''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]'' had established.<ref name=\"Rebel Files\" /> Due to a degree of miscommunication, however, Dodonna was killed in the climax of [[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]].
