While Aabe's deciding vote in the meeting did not grant the Skywalkers' request for free travel through Chiss Territory, he did suggest a compromise, offering access to the [[Expeditionary Library]] on Csilla as an invaluable resource in their search for [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]].\n\nIn order to ensure that the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]] remained outside the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]], Aabe ordered [[Ina'ganet'nuruodo|Ganet]] to kidnap and eliminate Soontir Fel's family, who were strong supporters for Csilla joining the Galactic Alliance. However, his plans were put to an end by [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] and [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Hess'irolia'nuruodo|Irolia]], and he was tried and imprisoned for his [[Treason/Legends|treason]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|peitaaabe|Aabe, Peita|archivedate=20100328104042}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Peita Aabe\n|es=Peita Aabe\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aabe, Peita}}\n[[Category:Chiss Expansionary Defense Force officers]]\n[[Category:Csillans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
