At the age of eleven, he attended the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], where he became fast friends with [[Tahiri Veila]]. Together, they enjoyed numerous adventures, which included freeing the imprisoned souls of [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] children.\n\nAnakin was one of the pivotal figures in the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], participating in several of the major battles and developing effective tactics against the [[Yuuzhan Vong]].

On another, he attempted to take over the body of the unborn child, in an effort to sustain his spirit in a more powerful form. However, the Emperor was [[Death/Legends|killed]], shot by Anakin's father, Han, before he could complete his plan. Though this happened, the dark essence of the Emperor went in the direction of Anakin, however the Jedi Knight [[Empatojayos Brand]] protected him and gave his life so he could continue his.<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]''</ref>\n\nAnakin spent the first year of his life on [[Anoth/Legends|Anoth]], an isolated planet which his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and the [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] of the New Republic, [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]], had fortified to protect the [[House of Solo|Solo]] children. There, Anakin was tended to by [[Nanny droid/Legends|nanny droids]] and his mother's best friend, [[Winter Celchu|Winter]]. His parents were allowed to visit every few [[Standard month/Legends|months]].

Eventually, Leia and Ackbar, who had been alerted of Furgan's plan, arrived and saved Anakin from the Ambassador's efforts.

The [[Droid/Legends|droid]] uploaded information regarding child-rearing into his [[Memory core|memory banks]] and met the challenge with initial enthusiasm but mixed results. After [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] returned from [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] with Han, he also aided in raising the Solo children.{{Fact}}\n\nDuring the [[Empire Reborn]] movement of [[14 ABY/Legends|14 ABY]], Anakin and his siblings were kidnapped by [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Hethrir]], the Imperial [[Procurator of Justice]], who wanted to take advantage of their [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]]. During Anakin's captivity, he became attached to [[Tigris]] who was his nursemaid and Hethrir's son. Lord Hethrir attempted to sacrifice the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-strong]] Anakin to a creature named [[Waru]] in exchange for Waru's help. However, Anakin's parents, along with his uncle Luke Skywalker, succeeded in rescuing the children, and Hethrir was destroyed by Waru.<ref name=\"The Crystal Star\">''[[The Crystal Star]]''</ref>\n\n{{Noncanonstart}}\nWhen Anakin was a child he had recurring dreams of his grandfather Darth Vader. Because Anakin would not confide in Leia, she sent Han to talk to him. Anakin then asked his father what happened to Luke's hand. In order to get rid of Anakin's nightmares of Darth Vader and explain the story of Luke's mechanical hand, Han told Anakin about their adventures during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. However, instead of putting Luke in the story he used Luke's hand. When Han finished the story Anakin claimed that he was going to be Luke's hand one day and then went to sleep pitting his hands against his feet.<ref name=\"The Secret Tales of Luke's Hand\">{{Tales|8|The Secret Tales of Luke's Hand!}}</ref>\n{{Noncanonend}}\n\n====The First Corellian Insurrection====\n{{Quote|And sometimes, when I don't plan it, something I do hurts somebody.|Anakin Solo|The New Rebellion}}\nIn [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]], Anakin accompanied his family on a vacation to the [[Corellian system]]. After their arrival, Leia hired a [[Drall/Legends|Drall]] named [[Ebrihim]] to tutor the children and act as a guide for the whole family. On their first outing, the family visited Corellia's first major [[Archaeology/Legends|archaeological]] site. While there, Anakin and his siblings became separated from the rest of the party because Anakin stopped to investigate something he had sensed through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. He tracked this sense with his siblings following him and eventually arrived at what would later be identified as Corellia's [[planetary repulsor]], one of which was located on each of the five [[Five Brothers|inhabited planets]] of the Corellian system. Later, the children told their parents what they had found in the tunnel.<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\">''[[Ambush at Corellia]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:AnakinSolo_negtc.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Young Anakin Solo]]\nAfter several [[Standard day/Legends|days]], during which they toured Corellia's main continent, Anakin and his family relocated their lodgings to [[Corona House/Legends|Corona House]] so that Leia could participate in the trade summit that was soon to be held. During the first night of the trade summit, the three children overheard a conversation between their parents, [[Master Trader]] [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], and [[Governor-General/Legends|Governor-General]] [[Micamberlecto]] and learned of a [[Centerpoint Station|starbuster]] plot which involved the destruction of entire [[Star system/Legends|star systems]].<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\" />\n\nAnakin, Jacen, and Jaina were confined to Corona House with Chewbacca, Ebrihim, and Ebrihim's [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]], [[Q9-X2]], while Leia and Han left to advise Micamberlecto on how to deal with the growing crisis. The Solo children watched from their apartment as enclaves within [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] burned to the ground and many people were killed in the first stages of what would later come to be known as the [[Corellian Crisis|Corellian Insurrection]]. Soon Corona House itself came under fire and the children and their companions fled to the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']].<ref name=\"Ambush at Corellia\" />\n\nWith the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] damaged by a [[Pocket Patrol Boat]], the decision was made to visit Ebrihim's Aunt [[Marcha]], the [[Duke/Legends|Duchess]] of [[Mastigophorous]], on [[Drall (planet)|Drall]]. Once there, Anakin, Jacen, and Jaina related to the Duchess their experience at the archaeological dig, the mysterious installation that they had found there, and the starbuster plot that they had heard about.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\">''[[Assault at Selonia]]''</ref>\n\nMarcha brought the Solo children to the approximate location of Drall's planetary repulsor and Anakin was able to find the repulsor using the Force. Once inside, he found hidden control panels and used them to operate parts of the repulsor. While everyone else was [[Sleep/Legends|asleep]], he sneaked away and activated the repulsor. Although Anakin was safe in one of the tunnels, the others were in danger of being killed by the energy of the activation. However, they were all eventually able to get to safety inside the ''Falcon''.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\n[[File:The_Corellian_Trilogy.jpg|thumb|left|Anakin imprints himself on Centerpoint Station]]\nAnakin later met his father's cousin [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]], who came as soon as he learned that Drall's planetary repulsor had been activated. Thrackan, planning to use the repulsor for his own ends, imprisoned Anakin, Jaina, Jacen, Chewbacca, Ebrihim, and Marcha. He then tried to use the children to blackmail their mother into getting the New Republic to recognize Corellian independence.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\" />\n\nAnakin showed Jacen and Jaina how to walk \"in between\" the [[Force field/Legends|force field]] using the Force and the children were able to escape using this technique. However, Chewbacca and the Drall could not get out. The children made their way, along with Q9-X2, to the ''Falcon'', and took off in it. Thrackan came after them, but they managed to evade his [[Starship/Legends|ship]] due to Jacen's [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]], Jaina's [[Gunner/Legends|gunnery]] skills, and Anakin's use of the [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shield]] to protect the ''Falcon''. The Solo children were then reunited with their parents aboard the [[Intruder (Namana-class)|''Intruder'']], a New Republic [[Bakura/Legends|Bakuran]] vessel that rescued them. However, Han and Leia soon had to leave as they had volunteered to help the [[Bakuran Defense Fleet|Bakuran fleet]] in its confrontation with the forces of the [[Sacorrian Triad]] at [[Centerpoint Station]].<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\">''[[Showdown at Centerpoint]]''</ref>\n\nBecause the systems of Drall's repulsor would only respond to Anakin, he and his siblings soon returned to the planetary repulsor. There, Anakin helped the Bakuran [[Technician/Legends|technicians]] as they tried to find a way to use the repulsor to stop the ancient [[Space station/Legends|space station]], Centerpoint, from exploding the [[Bovo Yagen (star)|star]] of [[Bovo Yagen (planet)|Bovo Yagen]]. Eventually, Anakin used the Force to aim the repulsor and stop the beam of energy coming from Centerpoint,<ref name=\"Showdown at Centerpoint\" /> saving billions of lives.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" />\n\nAfter the discovery of a partial copy of the [[Caamas Document]] in [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], and because of the [[Caamas Document Crisis|scandal]] that followed, Anakin and his siblings were sent to [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] with Chewbacca and a group of [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]] for their protection. After the crisis had passed, the three siblings attended the signing of the [[Pellaeon&ndash;Gavrisom Treaty]] with their parents aboard the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Chimaera/Legends|''Chimaera'']]. They also attended the [[wedding of Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Union\">''[[Star Wars: Union]]''</ref>\n\n===Jedi training (22 ABY&ndash;25 ABY)===\n{{Quote|Anakin wasn't a bother, was he?''\"<br />\"''Far from it.

There, he met and befriended [[Tahiri Veila]], an orphan from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Soon, he and Tahiri began sharing the same [[Dream/Legends|dream]] and decided it was their destiny to do what they did in the dream. Because of this, they sneaked out of the Great Temple taking their uncle's astromech droid, [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], with them. Eventually, they came to the crumbling [[Palace of the Woolamander]] inside of which they discovered the [[Golden Globe]] and the ancient [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Ikrit]] who had guarded it for hundreds of years. Ikrit informed the pair that the Golden Globe contained countless trapped [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] [[Soul/Legends|souls]] that could only be freed by Force-sensitive children. He also warned them that they could not tell Luke Skywalker about the Globe, or everything would be lost. R2-D2 then led the children and Ikrit safely back to the Great Temple where the children told Luke that they had just become lost taking a walk in the jungle.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: The Golden Globe\" />\n\nLater, Anakin and Tahiri accompanied the [[Melodie]] [[Lyric]] to her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Yavin 8/Legends|Yavin 8]] where she was to undergo an important form-changing ritual known as the [[Changing Ceremony]]. After safely delivering Lyric to the cove where she was to undergo the changing, Anakin and Tahiri helped the young Melodies fight off several native predators including an [[avril]], a [[reel]], and several [[raith]]s. As a reward for helping guard the [[Changeling (Melodie)|changelings]] Anakin and Tahiri were able to talk to [[Aragon]], the [[Keeper of Legends]] and ask him about the ancient carvings they had found at the Palace of the Woolamander. Aragon directed the children to some similar carvings deep within a [[Cave/Legends|cave]] on Yavin 8. From these carvings, the duo learned that Golden Globe contained the souls of the children of the Massassi that had been imprisoned by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] in [[3997 BBY]]. They also learned that it was held together by [[Sith magic]] that could only be broken by Force-sensitive children, as Ikrit had already told them.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Lyric's World\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Lyric's World]]''</ref>\n\nTahiri, accompanied by Anakin and the academy [[Historian/Legends|historian]], [[Tionne Solusar]], returned to her home planet of Tatooine to honor a promise she had made before she left for the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] academy. When she arrived on Tatooine, Tahiri was told that if she immediately returned to the academy, the tribe would kill Sliven. However, if Tahiri survived a dangerous trek across the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]] and the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]], the tribe would continue to follow Sliven and would tell Tahiri her history. Tahiri and Anakin chose to attempt the week-long survival trek together. Before they left, Sliven told Tahiri about her parents. Anakin and Tahiri were then left alone out in the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] without [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] or [[Water/Legends|water]]. They made their way back to the tribe using their Force abilities to survive the harsh deserts of the Dune Sea, evade a [[Sarlacc/Legends|sarlacc]], befriend a [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] clan, and defeat a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|Krayt dragon]]. However, both young Jedi were injured during the journey. Eventually, they were able to return to Yavin 4 where their wounds were treated.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Promises\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Promises]]''</ref>\n\nWhen their injuries from their trip to Tatooine were completely healed, Tahiri and Anakin made their way back to the Palace of the Woolamander to free the trapped souls within the Golden Globe. They were able to use the Force to weaken the force field around the Globe enough that Anakin could enter it. Once inside, Anakin was able to get the Massassi children to join [[Limb/Legends|hands]] and push their way out of the Globe. After the Massassi souls had escaped, the Globe fractured into thousands of pieces. The freed souls thanked the young Jedi and disappeared. Anakin and Tahiri returned to the Great Temple where Luke was waiting for them, having been told about the Golden Globe by Ikrit.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Promises\" />\n\n====Anakin's Quest====\n[[File:AnakinonDagobah.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Anakin, Tahiri Veila, R2-D2, and Ikrit encounter a knobby white spider on Dagobah]]\nAnakin remained troubled by [[Force vision/Legends|visions]] of himself as a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]], and by his heritage as the grandson of Anakin Skywalker, who had become the infamous Darth Vader. Because of this, the young Jedi asked if he could go to the very same [[Dark Side Cave]] on [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]] that Luke had entered years earlier when training with [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]].<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest]]''</ref>\n\nBefore arrangements for the trip could be made, Tahiri and Anakin found a youth named [[Uldir Lochett]] stowed away on the ''[[Lightning Rod]]'', a [[Supply ship/Legends|supply]] [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]]. Although Uldir lacked obvious Force sensitivity, he was determined to be a Jedi so Luke agreed to let him stay on at the academy for a while.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest\" />\n\nEventually, Anakin, Tahiri, and Ikrit traveled to Dagobah on the ''Lightning Rod'' with R2-D2 and [[Peckhum]] piloting the ship. Upon arriving, the group discovered that Uldir had again stowed away on the freighter. Leaving Peckhum with the ship, Anakin, Tahiri, Uldir, Ikrit, and R2-D2 set out for the cave. On the way, they encountered several [[Swamp/Legends|swamp]] creatures including a [[Knobby white spider/Legends|knobby white spider]]. Upon entering the cave, Anakin saw two of his possible future selves&mdash;one evil and one good. Ikrit later explained to Anakin and Tahiri that their choices would decide who they became. R2-D2 then guided the group to [[Yoda's hut]]. Afterwards, they returned to Yavin 4.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest\" />\n\n====Mission to Bast Castle====\nLater that year, the Jedi historian Tionne Solusar discovered that after Darth Vader and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] lightsaber duel on the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|First Death Star]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], during which Vader killed Kenobi, Vader had saved Kenobi's lightsaber and had kept it at [[Bast Castle]] on [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]]. Since an information broker had sold this information to Tionne, she feared that others may have learned of it before she did and, because of this, quickly informed Luke Skywalker at the Jedi Praxeum. Luke agreed that Tionne should [[Mission to Bast Castle|go to Bast Castle]] to look for the lightsaber and allowed Anakin, Tahiri, Uldir, Ikrit, and R2-D2 to accompany her to Vjun on her personal transport, ''[[Lore Seeker]]''.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress]]''</ref>\n\nHaving arrived on Vjun, they discovered another vessel and feared another group had entered the castle first. To reach Bast Castle, the group had to climb a long length of stairs in rain and sleet. Upon entering the castle, the group encountered lasers being shot at them. Anakin arrived at the conclusion that the lasers were automatic and came up with a successful plan to turn them off. The group then began exploring the castle, eventually splitting up into groups. After evading more booby traps, the group discovered Kenobi's lightsaber. However, a man named [[Orloc]], who claimed to be a mage who possessed great powers, stole the lightsaber, dropped Tionne and Ikrit down a trap door, and seemingly disappeared in a cloud of smoke.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress\" />\n\nThe Jedi trainees, now on their own, decided to pursue Orloc. Uldir and R2-D2 went one way and Anakin and Tahiri went another. Anakin and Tahiri found Vader's bedchamber and discovered that he had kept a hologram of Luke, his son. Uldir was the first to find Orloc and talked with him for a while. Orloc claimed that he could train Uldir in all of the Force skills he desired and also told him that there was a [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]] hidden in Vader's bedchamber. Eventually, the other Jedi arrived, rescued Uldir, escaped Bast Castle, and returned to the Jedi Praxeum, with Kenobi's lightsaber and [[Asli Krimsan's holocron]].<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress\" />\n\n====Mission to Exis Station====\nDespite having escaped Orloc, Uldir was obsessed with what Orloc told him and still believed that the mage would be able to awaken the Force powers within him, which nobody at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 had been able to do as of yet. Because of this, Uldir stole Ikrit's ship, [[Sunrider (starship)|''Sunrider'']], Kenobi's lightsaber, and the holocron to travel to an abandoned space station called [[Exis Station/Legends|Exis Station]] where he believed Orloc was staying.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Kenobi's_Blade.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anakin used Obi Wan Kenobi's lightsaber to defeat Orloc.]]\nUpon arriving on Exis Station, Uldir was captured by Orloc. He then offered Orloc the two Jedi artifacts in exchange for Orloc teaching him of the Force. Orloc, who actually had no Force sensitivity, agreed to this arrangement and began using high-tech gimmicks as demonstrations of his \"Force powers\" to deceive Uldir.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade\" />\n\nAnakin, Tahiri, Tionne and Ikrit set out to find Uldir on the ''Lore Seeker'' and eventually arrived at Exis Station. After avoiding being killed by Orloc's droids and Ranat mercenaries, the Jedi found Uldir and Orloc and tried to explain to Uldir that Orloc was a fraud. The mage began to attack the four Jedi with his high-tech tricks, but the Jedi fought back by using the Force.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade\" />\n\nHowever, Tionne was wounded and Anakin and Tahiri had to protect her by defeating the assassin droids Orloc sent to kill them. Uldir then saw that Orloc was a fake and began to help Anakin and Tahiri but was injured. Ikrit&mdash;who had sworn not to wield a lightsaber until he had found worthy students&mdash;dueled Orloc who was using Kenobi's lightsaber. Suddenly, Orloc's stolen lightsaber flew across the room to Anakin, who picked it up and began working his way toward Orloc. Upon reaching Orloc, Anakin used the lightsaber to destroy Orloc's controls for all of his technology. Having defeated the mage, the Jedi returned to the Jedi Praxeum, where they recovered from their injuries and Uldir decided to become a pilot instead of a Jedi.<ref name=\"Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade\" />\n\n====Encountering Zekk====\n[[File:Anakin_Solo_by_Brian_Rood.jpg|thumb|left|Anakin Solo]]\nAnakin later returned to Coruscant and studied under C-3PO's guidance. In [[23 ABY/Legends|23 ABY]], Anakin assisted his siblings, who had returned to Coruscant for a visit, in locating their orphan friend [[Zekk]] who had disappeared after being embarrassed during a banquet with the Solo family. Jacen and his fellow [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi trainee]] [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]] eventually found Zekk giving a speech to a group of teens from the street gang [[Lost Ones]] in the lower levels of Coruscant. [[Tamith Kai]], an assistant at the [[Second Imperium]]'s [[Shadow Academy]] for training Dark Jedi, arrived with [[Garowyn]] and [[Vilas]] who were to help her recruit people to be trained at the Academy. Jacen and Jaina found out that Zekk was Force-sensitive and had decided to train to become a Dark Jedi at the Shadow Academy but were then stunned by Vilas.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones]]''</ref>\n\nThanks to a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] Jacen was carrying, Leia, Anakin, and C-3PO found Jacen and Tenel Ka. They all returned to the upper levels of Coruscant and eventually the Jedi were able to stop the Second Imperium.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: The Lost Ones\" />\n\n====Return to Yavin====\nAnakin later returned to the Jedi Praxeum to aid in its reconstruction after it was attacked by the Second Imperium. During [[24 ABY/Legends|24 ABY]], he accompanied his father to [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]]<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Return to Ord Mantell\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Return to Ord Mantell]]''</ref> and helped take down the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]. Later that year, he was promoted to an apprentice [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] along with several other trainees, including his older siblings, during a ceremony at the Jedi Praxeum.<ref name=\"Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef]]''</ref> He and Jacen then became Luke's [[Padawan/Legends|apprentices]].<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" />\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong War (25 ABY&ndash;29 ABY)===\n{{Quote|Don't lie to me, Anakin.

They discovered the moon was on collision course with the planet, endangering countless lives. This event, unbeknownst to them, was a Yuuzhan Vong tactic, [[Yo'gand's Core]]. While trying to evacuate locals, Anakin was knocked down by strong winds into the distance, causing Chewie to run after him. Chewie was able to bring Anakin to the safety of the ''Falcon'', but another blast of wind knocked him out of reach. Anakin piloted the ''Falcon'', while his father stood on the entrance ramp hoping to lift Chewie up, but they were forced to flee from Sernpidal when Anakin realized it was too late to save Chewie. The Wookiee stood in the moon's trajectory, howling defiantly, and was crushed to death.<ref name=\"Vector Prime\" /> This incident hurt relations between Anakin and his father, who blamed him. It would be months before father and son reconciled.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" />\n\nAnakin began developing Jedi tactics against the Yuuzhan Vong. At [[Dubrillion/Legends|Dubrillion]], he rediscovered a lost Force skill, [[Battle meditation]], and initiated a technique known as [[Force meld]] between his siblings. This technique was used to coordinate Jedi in battle, namely in spaceflight throughout the war.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" /> He also designed the prototype for the [[YVH 1|Yuuzhan Vong Hunter Droids (YVH)]] manufactured by Lando Calrissian,<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" /> as well as a computer program that kept track of usage of data in the library to facilitate missions for the Jedi.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\n====A New Student====\n{{Quote|You must be the ''new guy''. Don't worry&mdash;Master Skywalker does that to everyone.|Anakin Solo to Finn Galfridian|Invasion 2}}\nEarly on in the war, a new student began to attend the Jedi Academy&mdash;[[Finn Galfridian]], prince of [[Artorias]]. During one of Finn's training sessions, Anakin, Jaina, Jacen, and Lowbacca approached the new student, who was looking at a large chunk of land. Jacen asked if Finn's rock was underneath, and Anakin followed up by saying Luke did it to everyone&mdash;except for Lowbacca.\n\n====Battle of Dantooine====\n[[File:Solokids_NewEssential.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Anakin with his brother and sister]]\nFollowing that, Anakin accompanied Mara Jade Skywalker to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] where Mara hoped to halt the progress of the [[Coomb spore]] disease that was killing her on the planet's unspoiled grasslands. They were soon joined by refugees from Dubrillion, evacuated by Lando Calrissian. While there, Mara gave Anakin important lessons on not using the Force to do the most mundane of tasks, such as lifting boxes. Later, Anakin was approached by [[Tuber (Dantari)|a Dantooine native]]. Anakin was worried that the native would attack, but when Mara gave him a button from her jacket, the native replied by bringing Anakin special roots from a [[Blba tree/Legends|Blba tree]]. Anakin agreed to give back the roots if the native brought him firewood. The native, misunderstanding, brought Anakin a log. It was later revealed that the root was a powerful medicine, so Anakin gave some to Mara, and it helped her growing disease slightly. Soon afterward, the Yuuzhan Vong followed them and a [[Battle of Dantooine (Yuuzhan Vong War)|great massacre]] began. During the battle, the Yuuzhan Vong unleashed legions of reptoid [[Chazrach]] slave soldiers and beetle-like [[Thrall herder]]s from [[Yuuzhan Vong galaxy|their galaxy]]. Anakin and his older brother Jacen would discover that these Chazrach were entirely mindless and were merely the Yuuzhan Vong's equivalent to [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]]. They slaughtered dozens of Chazrach and Luke Skywalker also destroyed a thrall herder, causing much of the enemy force to scatter and allowing the refugees to escape Dantooine.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\n====Hunt for Daeshara'cor====\nWhen Luke discovered that Jedi Knight [[Daeshara'cor]] was looking for superweapons, Anakin accompanied his aunt, uncle, and a man named [[Chalco]] on his search for her. They first visited [[Vortex/Legends|Vortex]], the homeworld of the [[Vor]]s. While there, Anakin was ordered to stay aboard the ship with Chalco, while Luke and Mara went to meet [[Qwi Xux]]. Xux directed them to the planet [[Garos IV]]. While there, Luke again ordered Anakin to stay at the ship, but he and Chalco disobeyed. Anakin discovered Daeshara'cor, but she knocked him out and took him to her apartment, where she tied him up. It was then that Chalco, who Anakin had grown close to, broke in, wearing an [[ysalamir]] skin. Daeshara'cor easily deflected the man's stun blast, but Anakin Force-threw the blaster into her head.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" />\n\n====Battle of Ithor====\nLater, Anakin was among a task force of Jedi present at the [[Battle of Ithor]]. Shortly before the battle, Anakin said goodbye to Chalco, who went with [[Mirax Terrik Horn]] to take [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] refugees to safety. Before the battle, the Jedi were required by the Ithorians to give up a negative trait. Anakin chose to give up self-assuredness, which surprised his brother.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" />\n[[File:Anakin_and_Daeshara'cor.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anakin defends the wounded Daeshara'cor]]\nDuring the battle, he was teamed up with Daeshara'cor. While fighting a [[Warrior caste|warrior]], Daeshara'cor was wounded by an [[amphistaff]]'s poisonous bite. Wielding both his own violet lightsaber and her crimson lightsaber, he defended her from further injury. Although he had managed to get Daeshara'cor back to the medical bay with the help from his aunt and uncle, she died&mdash;reassuring Anakin that she wouldn't have changed anything. Despite her words, Anakin blamed himself for not being able to save her and live up to Chewbacca's sacrifice.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II: Ruin\" />\n\n====Centerpoint Station====\nDespite the growing [[Anti-Jedi sentiment/Legends|Anti-Jediism]] during the war, Anakin's heroic acts led many New Republic citizens to regard him as a galactic hero and the freshest face of the [[New Jedi Order]]&mdash;much like his grandfather was during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. There were many whispers that Anakin would one day take his uncle's place as the most powerful Jedi. Mara Jade noted that when he walked by, many females turned their heads to watch him.<ref name=\"Balance Point\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref>\n\nAnakin was later asked to repair Centerpoint Station. He accepted, and he and Jacen went to the station. Only after it was fully repaired was it clear that the Yuuzhan Vong had never intended to attack Corellia, but instead had planned a sneak attack on Fondor.<ref name=\"Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Fondor|battle]], Anakin could have wiped out the assembled Yuuzhan Vong fleet at [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]] through the use of Centerpoint Station had it not been for his older brother Jacen. Jacen dissuaded his brother from using the station as a weapon, on the basis that it was against the Jedi beliefs. Unfortunately, an old enemy in the form of their cousin, the infamous Thrackan Sal-Solo fired the weapon, destroying the Yuuzhan Vong fleet. Though the casualties among the Yuuzhan Vong were great, much of the [[Hapan]] fleet was destroyed in the wake of the blast. This incident furthered the rift between the two brothers, Anakin knowing he could have destroyed the Yuuzhan Vong fleet without the collateral damage if he had taken the shot, instead of listening to Jacen.<ref name=\"Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse\" />\n\n====Fall of Duro====\n[[File:AnakinBP.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Anakin Solo during the Fall of Duro]]\nTwo months after the Centerpoint incident, Anakin was meeting with a group of Jedi that consisted of his uncle and aunt, [[Kenth Hamner]], [[Cilghal]], and Cilghal's apprentice, [[Tekli]]. When Tekli revealed that there was a possible Yuuzhan Vong spy at the restaurant [[Leafy Green]], Anakin and Mara went to investigate. They tracked the spy&mdash;a female Yuuzhan Vong&mdash;across Coruscant and into an alley, where Anakin hit her with a short-range variant of the [[Stokhli spray stick]], after fighting off a swarm of [[Razor bug]]s. Unfortunately, the spy managed to kill herself by slashing her own throat before scientists could properly study her.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\nAnakin traveled with Mara and Luke to Duro after [[Tresina Lobi]]'s apprentice, [[Thrynni Vae]], went missing. While there, the trio were disguised as [[Kubaz/Legends|Kubaz]]. Anakin and Luke were standing to the side when Jacen explained to CorDuro's [[Vice-director]], [[Durgard Brarun]], that he was trying not to use the Force. Anakin was unsettled by this, but still participated when his family, now including his older sister Jaina, went to rescue Jacen. It was later revealed that Thrynni Vae had been killed.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\nDuring the rescue attempt, Anakin caused a distraction by jumping on a stage and challenging his uncle to a duel. While the audience was distracted by the swordplay, Jaina sneaked up to Jacen's room and convinced him to leave. Anakin and Luke were then forced to abandon their distraction when armed guards opened fire on the duo. Along with Mara, they held off the guards long enough for Jaina and Jacen to escape, and then followed closely.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\nLater, Anakin played an important role during the [[Battle of Duro (Yuuzhan Vong War)|defense]] of [[Duro/Legends|Duro]] when he defended the orbital city of [[Orr-Om]] by shooting down a serpentine [[Ychna]] which was attacking it, shooting a [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton torpedo]] into the creature's mouth. When Mara Jade landed the ''[[Jade Shadow]]'' in one of the cities to talk with admiral [[Darez Wuht]], Anakin remained in his X-wing, patrolling the area. When Mara took off, and large portions of the docking bay remained attached to the ''Shadow'', Anakin attempted to shoot them off, but was unsuccessful. Unfortunately, the small force was unable to defend Duro alone, and the Yuuzhan Vong finally overtook the planet, forcing Anakin and his family to retreat.<ref name=\"Balance Point\" />\n\n====Hero to the enemy====\n{{Quote|You may not know it, but all of the younger Jedi and a lot of the older ones look up to you. The buzz is you're the next Luke Skywalker, at the very least.|[[Corran Horn]]|The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth}}\n[[File:ATI.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Anakin Solo, Tahiri, and Ikrit in 26 ABY, with Vua Rapuung in the foreground]]\nDuring a meeting on Coruscant, in which [[Kyp Durron]] expressed his distaste for Luke Skywalker's methods, Anakin and his sister, Jaina, tried to keep Durron from leaving Coruscant. Durron argued with both of them that they should come with him, but they both declined.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nAnakin determined that the Vong and their [[Peace Brigade]] allies would [[Invasion of Yavin 4|Attack]] the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, having had a vision of Tahiri in danger. However, when he told his uncle, Luke told him that he could not go. Knowing Tahiri could die if he did not go, Anakin forged permission to leave Coruscant and set out with his droid, Fiver.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nThe Peace Brigade did attack the Praxeum, and Anakin was caught in a firefight in Yavin space. Upon landing, he was greeted by [[Kam Solusar]] and later Tahiri. He informed them of the Peace Brigade's imminent attack, and Solusar agreed to let Anakin and Ikrit stay behind to hold of the Brigade.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nUnfortunately, Anakin did not count on Tahiri, [[Valin Horn]], and [[Sannah]] sneaking away from the Solusars to assist him. Anakin and Tahiri were forced to steal a Peace Brigade ship belonging to [[Remis Vehn]].<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nDuring their flight from the Temple, however, Ikrit stayed behind to hold off the Peace Brigade and was killed. Tahiri, in an attempt to recover her master's body, leapt from the ship, only to be captured. Anakin, Vehn, Valin, and Sannah were forced to leave Tahiri behind.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\nWhile Anakin was in the process of repairing the ship and building a speeder to take him back to the Praxeum, [[Qorl]], a former [[TIE pilot]] who had befriended his older siblings, showed up, allowing Anakin to leave him in charge of the repairs. While returning to the Praxeum, Anakin encountered many warriors. He was able to defeat most, but was almost killed before [[Vua Rapuung]], a [[Shamed Ones|Shamed]] outcast Yuuzhan Vong, came to assist him, asking for help.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nVua Rapuung helped Anakin reach the Yuuzhan Vong encampment. Anakin's lightsaber was damaged in the process, forcing him to rebuild it with a Yuuzhan Vong [[lambent]] that he stole while pretending to be a slave. He attuned his lightsaber to himself and discovered a way to sense the Vong through the Force, channeled through the lambent. Anakin was the first Jedi since [[Vergere]] to sense the Yuuzhan Vong, and thus called it \"[[Vongsense]],\" a name which Jacen later adopted.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong had performed numerous experiments on Tahiri during her captivity, but Anakin and Raapung fought through hordes of warriors and helped her recover from the ordeal. Anakin told Tahiri that he loved her, and she snapped out of the [[Mezhan Kwaad]]'s shaping. Unfortunately, during their escape, Raapung was killed, although Kwaad admitted that it was she who had shamed him. After their escape, rumors of their exploits on Yavin 4 ran rampant through the labor class [[Worker caste|Workers]] and the outcast Shamed Ones of the Yuuzhan Vong, who soon began to see the Jedi as their salvation, as Anakin's exploits had helped remove Vua's shamed status.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory I: Conquest\" />\n\nFollowing that ordeal, Anakin, Tahiri, and [[Corran Horn]] traveled to [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]]. While there, Tahiri and Anakin sensed a Jedi in trouble. Running to the location of the Jedi, they found a dying [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] Jedi named [[Kelbis Nu]] being attacked by a group of Peace Brigaders. After defeating the Brigaders, Anakin ran to Nu's side while Tahiri called for assistance. Nu told Anakin that [[Yag'Dhul/Legends|Yag'Dhul]]&mdash;the homeworld of the mathematical [[Givin/Legends|Givin]]&mdash;would be the next target of the Yuuzhan Vong because it was located right where the [[Corellian Trade Spine/Legends|Corellian Trade Spine]] and the [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]] met.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, before they could act on this information, they were arrested by the Eriaduan judicials under a Human male named [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Themion]]. Tahiri broke free and rescued Anakin&mdash;uttering a Yuuzhan Vong war cry&mdash;and the two made their escape. In the lobby, they found two judicials dueling with their lightsabers. They Force pulled them away when one judicial made a sloppy slash, making it look like the judicial had knocked both lightsabers away. After reclaiming their lightsabers and hijacking a police speeder, though the two Jedi eventually reached the spaceport and escaped off-world with Corran Horn on their transport ''[[Lucre]]''. They came out of hyperspace in the midst of a Vong fleet and landed on what was assumed to be was an asteroid, but was actually a Yuuzhan Vong [[Yorik-stronha]] (spy ship-analogue) which was christened ''[[Stalking Moon]]''.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth\" />\n\nHaving arrived, they managed to warn the Givin [[Dodecian]] of the [[Battle of Yag'Dhul (26 ABY)|impeding invasion]] of their planet. When the Vong arrived, Anakin Solo dueled a team leader named [[Shok Choka]]. He managed to kill Choka before the Givin decompressed the space station to kill the Yuuzhan Vong. Tahiri and Anakin were forced to stay in a storage locker while Horn went to find vac suits. Feeling the end was near, Anakin admitted his love for her and the two shared a kiss. They were later rescued by Corran while the combined Givin/New Republic fleet drove back the extragalactic invaders.<ref name=\"Edge of Victory II: Rebirth\" />\n\n====Myrkr====\n{{Quote|I witnessed the death of perhaps the greatest of them all, the one called Anakin Solo, who gave his life so that the ones he loved might live.|[[Nom Anor]]|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\n[[File:ASbS.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Anakin at the time of his death in 27 ABY]]\nIn [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]], the Yuuzhan Vong had created a new creature called a [[Voxyn]]. This creature was proficient in hunting down and killing Jedi. Anakin and his friends&mdash;including Tahiri, [[Raynar Thul]], [[Lowbacca]], Jacen, Jaina, and Tenel Ka&mdash;later received a report that their friend from the Praxeum, [[Lusa]], had been killed by a Voxyn. During a meeting, Anakin volunteered to lead a strike mission to kill the Voxyn queen. Though his father was at first set against the idea, the mission was approved, and Anakin selected a [[Myrkr strike team|small band of Jedi]].<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nThe mission began when Lando Calrissian, posing as a defector, offered Anakin and his team to [[Duman Yaght|a Yuuzhan Vong commander]]. During the faked capture, one of the team's members, [[Ulaha Kore]], was badly wounded by a Yuuzhan Vong wielding a [[Coufee]]. En route to the [[Koros-Strohna]] ''[[Baanu Rass]]'', which orbited [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]], Yaght took [[Ganner Rhysode]], who was acting as team leader, to the bridge, while torturing Kore. Jacen Solo, using a mind meld, linked the strike team together through the Force. When it looked like Kore would be unable to handle any more torture, Yaght asked Jaina to pick a new subject, forcing her to choose between Anakin and Jacen. Anakin insisted through the Force that she pick him, and reluctantly, she did. Anakin whispered something in Kore's ear, and she attempted to impale her hand upon a Voxyn's poisonous spines.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nSoon, rescue came in the form of two of Lando's YVH droids [[YVH 2-1S]] and [[YVH 2-4S|2-4S]]. Jacen confronted Anakin about his discussion with Ulaha, believing he had told her to make the suicidal attack on the Voxyn. However, Anakin told Jacen that he had not done so, and instead told the Bith to reveal the name of [[Eclipse Station]] to Yaght. The team successfully rescued Ganner from the bridge, where [[Tesar Sebatyne]] shot the Yaght in the face, killing him.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" /> Though they successfully reached Myrkr, the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to stop them from landing. Ulaha remained behind to distract the Vong while Anakin and the remaining team members dropped to the worldship. They landed on the worldship, but Kore and the droid 2-1S were destroyed in the process. The group soon stumbled upon an Ysalamir-riddled prison, where [[Lomi Plo]] and [[Welk]], two Dark Jedi, were discovered. Anakin allowed them to join the team, but would only give them blasters, not lightsabers. Soon after, 2-4S was destroyed, as well.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nThe group soon stumbled upon an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]], which was inactive. The Yuuzhan Vong had placed a trap inside, and small bugs bit and wounded Lowbacca and [[Jovan Drark]]. They soon stumbled upon a slave city, where [[Eryl Besa]] and Drark were killed, and Anakin was wounded with an amphistaff through his side.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n[[File:Myrkr_NEC.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Anakin and his siblings fight the voxyn]]\n\nSoon afterward, [[Bela Hara]] was killed, and Tesar Sebatyne took possession of her white-bladed lightsaber. The teams third Barabel member, Bela's hatchmate [[Krasov Hara]], was also killed with voxyn acid in her face. The team soon discovered an escape ship, the ''[[Tachyon Flier]]''. Lomi Plo and Welk, sensing that the mission was taking a downward turn and considering Anakin suicidal since he did not have an escape route, stole the ship, which had the wounded Raynar Thul aboard, and wiped most of the team's memory of them. Shortly afterward, Anakin stayed behind in a [[Grashal]] to fight off as many Yuuzhan Vong as he could and give the rest of the team time to accomplish the mission. Tahiri, weeping, rejected him a last goodbye kiss, saying he'd have to return for it.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nAnakin was unable to return, as the Vong overwhelmed him, and he began fighting them in an intense battle, pouring [[Force lightning/Legends|pure white energy]] from his fingers to disintegrate the warriors. The [[Force energy]] that he drew upon overwhelmed a damaged body; having been mortally wounded going to his sister's aid, as Anakin died a beacon of light surrounded by the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nThe remaining team members were assisted by the alien Vergere, who gave Jacen Anakin's lightsaber, while Jaina, Tahiri, and some others went to recover Anakin's corpse. Jacen, Tesar, and the rest assaulted the voxyn queen's cavern, and Anakin's older brother killed the queen by using the Force to make her tail go into a void created by a dovin basal. Jaina and the others managed to steal Nom Anor's ship, the [[Trickster|''Ksstarr'']], but Jacen was captured.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nAnakin's death forced Jacen into a prominent role, pushed his sister Jaina to the edge of the dark side, and launched Tahiri into the throes of despair. His sister and the other escapees flew his body to Hapes, where family and friends gathered for a funeral.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\n===Funeral===\n{{Quote|Anakin saved my life.|Tahiri Veila to Han Solo, at Anakin's funeral.|The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey}}\nThe funeral for Anakin was in Hapes, where the survivors from Myrkr (excluding Jacen) gathered, and friends and family.

Jacen also saw the form of Anakin again while running from the [[Jedi Temple]], although this turned out to be a trick of a Yuuzhan Vong [[Cavern beast]]. Jacen also may have encountered Anakin's [[Force ghost]] on [[Coruscant/Legends#Yuuzhan'tar|Yuuzhan'tar]] in the Solo's former apartment. There, the apparition encouraged him to embrace Vergere's view of the Force. However, it is just as likely that the spirit was either a hallucination or a deliberate trick on Vergere's part,<ref name=\"Traitor\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Traitor]]''</ref> and even more so later, when [[Lumiya]] used Vergere to lure Jacen to the dark side.\n\n====Anakin's lightsaber====\n{{Quote|Should the need ever arise, it can be withdrawn by someone as virtuous as yourself, Chewbacca.|Luke Skywalker, at the lightsaber's final resting place|The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force}}\nAnakin's [[Anakin Solo's lightsaber|lightsaber]] proved to play a significant role in defeating the Yuuzhan Vong. First, Jacen used the weapon in his final battle with the voxyn queen. After this, Vergere gave the Vong the weapon, and Nom Anor gave it to Jacen in exchange for him converting to their religion. Jacen deceived them, and lied about his conversion. Ganner Rhysode came to rescue Jacen, where Jacen proved his trust in Ganner by giving the other man his brother's lightsaber. Much as Anakin himself had, Ganner became one with the Force and with this tremendous power, [[Battle of the World-Well|used the lightsaber]] to kill hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Yuuzhan Vong while Jacen sabotaged Yuuzhan'tar's [[World Brain]]. Rhysode was eventually killed when he used the Force to bring down the ceiling of the [[Well of the World Brain]], which had formerly been the [[Grand Convocation Chamber|Senate Rotunda]].<ref name=\"Traitor\" />\n\nFinally, the lightsaber was used by [[Supreme Overlord]] [[Shimrra Jamaane|Shimrra]] for his duel against Luke during the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|Recapture of Coruscant]].

The droid was built incorporating Anakin's biometric data and thought patterns, which made him believe he was a resurrected Anakin until [[Ben Skywalker]] convinced it otherwise. He used magnetics to duplicate the Force, and also jokingly referred to himself as Anakin Sal-Solo, having the mind of Anakin and being built by Thrackan.

The year 40 ABY saw the creation of the Alliance's [[Galactic Alliance Guard|secret police force]], the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]], headed by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] Jacen Solo. Colonel Solo sought to honor his fallen brother by bestowing Anakin's name on an ''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer, despite objections from his family. Upon its completion, the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']] served as the flagship for the Guard.<ref name=\"Tempest\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]''</ref>\n\nAs Jacen immersed himself ever further into the allure of the dark side, he began using the Guard and the ''Anakin Solo'' with ruthless efficiency to either arrest or kill his enemies. He used the weapons systems on his Star Destroyer in an attempt to destroy the ''Millennium Falcon'' and sacrifice his parents' lives in order to pass his final test as a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]].<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Although Jacen turned to darkness in order to save the Galaxy from future catastrophes by enforcing order and security, Anakin's death was a factor that sobered his cheery childhood personality. This internal shift, which made him very rational, had a psychological effect that allowed Jacen to become more susceptible to the allure of the dark side.<ref name=\"Exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref> Upon meeting a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]], Lumiya, Jacen became fully convinced that the Galaxy would never have an enduring era of peace and stability unless he embraced his destiny as a Sith.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nUpon becoming a full-fledged Sith himself, Jacen adopted the name Darth Caedus and took further advantage of his brother's memory. As the Dark Lord of the Sith, Caedus required an [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] to stand at his side in accordance with the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]]. After much consideration, he settled on Tahiri Veila. Anakin's sacrifice also had a profound effect on the girl he loved, and she never fully recovered from her grief over the loss of her childhood friend. Knowing this, Caedus took advantage of Veila's feelings and used her emotional attachment to bring her over to the dark side. Through a rare Force technique, Caedus enabled Veila to [[Flow-walking|flow-walk]] into the past so that she could relive her final moments with Anakin just prior to his death.

But the proposal was rejected by [[George Lucas]], who felt that Anakin's trajectory followed his namesake's plotline in the [[prequel trilogy]] too closely; thus, creating confusion.

[[Michael A.

While Veitch doesn't have anything against their decisions, he felt a certain amount of regret that many stories focusing on Anakin's inner conflict were never told.<ref name=\"Anakin's Abandoned CA\"
