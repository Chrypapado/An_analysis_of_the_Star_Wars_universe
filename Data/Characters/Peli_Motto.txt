I've heard that before.|The Mandalorian and Peli Motto|Chapter 5: The Gunslinger}}\n'''Peli Motto''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] who managed [[Hangar 3-5]] at [[Mos Eisley]] [[spaceport]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]]. Motto was a skilled [[engineer]] and made her living repairing and refueling [[Starship|starships]]. Though scrappy and brutally honest, she was a compassionate and hardworking proprietor.\n\n[[Standard year|Years]] after the fall of the [[Galactic Empire]], the [[bounty hunter]]  [[Din Djarin]], known simply as the [[Mandalorian]], landed at Peli Motto's hangar in desperate need of repairs. When he left to find work to cover Motto's bill, the mechanic discovered an infant being, [[Grogu]], alone aboard his [[Razor Crest|gunship]]. Hoping to charge the Mandalorian extra, Motto began caring for the child. Unknown to Motto, however, was that both Djarin and Grogu had a bounty on their heads, and rookie bounty hunter [[Toro Calican]] took Motto and Grogu hostage in a bid to collect on the prize. After a standoff with Djarin that left Calican [[Death|dead]], the Mandalorian paid Motto for the repairs and left with Grogu.\n\nA short time after his first visit, Djarin [[Mission to Tatooine (Din Djarin)|returned]] to Tatooine and met with Motto for aid in his search for fellow Mandalorians. Motto sent him to the town [[Mos Pelgo]], which was run by [[Cobb Vanth|a marshal]] donning [[Mandalorian armor]]. When Djarin returned, having found that the sheriff was not a Mandalorian himself, Motto helped him once more by arranging a [[Mission to Trask|job]] that would lead him to a [[Mandalorian resistance|group]] of Mandalorians on [[Trask]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Meeting the Mandalorian===\n{{Quote|Let's look at your ship. Oof! Look at that. Ugh, you got a lot of carbon scorin' building up on top. Yeah. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were in a shootout.|Peli Motto looks over the ''Razor Crest''|Chapter 5: The Gunslinger}}\n[[File:Motto_Scanner.png|thumb|left|250px|Peli Motto assessed the damage to the ''Razor Crest''.]]\nPeli Motto was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] who ran [[Hangar 3-5]] in [[Mos Eisley]] [[spaceport]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]] during the [[New Republic Era|reign]] of the [[New Republic]]. In [[9 ABY]], the [[gunship]] known as the ''[[Razor Crest]]'' was directed to land in [[Hangar|bay]] 3-5 and upon the [[Starship|vessel]] landing, Motto's three [[DUM-series pit droid]]s gathered their tools and approached the ship to see what repair work was needed. The ship's owner, the [[bounty hunter]] known as [[Din Djarin|the Mandalorian]], emerged and scared off the [[droid]]s by firing a [[blaster]] bolt at them. Annoyed at the treatment of her droids, Motto yelled at the bounty hunter from her office area and emerged to inspect the ship herself.<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" />\n\nWhile examining the ship, Motto found a [[fuel]] leak and various other repairs that were needed, as well as signs of a recent battle. The [[Mandalorian]] made clear that he did not want the droids working on his ship, and offered five hundred [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[credit]]s for the work to be done. After consulting her droids, Motto explained that the credits would only be enough to cover using the hangar, so the bounty hunter promised to return with more and left to find work.<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" />\n\n===A profitable baby===\n{{Quote|You woke it up!

Before they could continue the round however, strange noises began emerging from within the ''Razor Crest''. Ordering one of her droids to fetch her [[blaster rifle]], Motto began cautiously approaching the ship and yelled a warning to whoever was inside, but lower the weapon when Grogu emerged alone. Picking up the child, she began talking soothingly too it and ordered a pit droid to fetch Grogu some [[Foodstuff|food]].<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" />\n\nMotto worked on the Mandalorian's ship, slowed by the fact that her droids were forbade to help her, and started repairing the fuel leak before encountering several issues she needed to discuss with the hunter. She then eventually managed to get Grogu to fall asleep and also dozed off herself within the hangar. When the Mandalorian returned, having found work with a rookie bounty hunter named [[Toro Calican]], he discovered the missing baby and angrily woke Motto. The hangar owner scolded him for leaving Grogu alone and updated him on her repairs before following him outside, where Calican was waiting.<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" />\n\n===Captured by Calican===\n{{Quote|All right, pit droids!

The rookie captured Motto and Grogu and waited with them inside the ''Razor Crest'' for the Mandalorian's return, emerging with Motto at [[blaster]] point and the infant in his arms once the Mandalorian entered the hangar. The Mandalorian dropped his blaster and surrendered as Calican threatened Motto, after which the rookie hunter ordered her to place the Mandalorian in [[Stuncuffs|binders]].<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" />\n\nAs she followed his orders, the Mandalorian revealed that he was still holding a [[flash charge]] to her which he then fired off, blinding Calican. Motto used the opportunity to hide behind some crates, while the Mandalorian avoided Calican's blaster fire and shot him [[Death|dead]], causing him to tumble off the ''Razor Crest's'' ramp while still holding Grogu. Motto and the Mandalorian rushed to check if Grogu was alright, but discovered it had crawled away to safety behind some crates. After she cradled the infant and soothed it after all the excitement, the Mandalorian paid her with what credits Calican had been carrying. As the bounty hunter boarded his ship and left Tatooine, Motto ordered her droids to remove Calican's body from the hangar and dump it in [[Beggar's Canyon]].<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" />\n\n===The Mandalorian returns===\n{{Quote|I'm here on business.

Motto expressed her pleasure at seeing Grogu and warned her droids not to go near Djarin's ship. However, when Djarin admitted his ship needed a once-over, Motto let her droids have at it. Djarin said that he was here on business, asking Motto for directions to [[Mos Pelgo]]. After seeing Grogu one more time, she directed the [[astromech droid]] [[R5-D4]] to show Djarin an old planetary map of Tatooine where she indicated where Mos Pelgo used to be. Motto warned that it was an abandoned town and that she was not even sure it was still there. She then allowed Djarin to take her speeder to travel to the town while she looked after his ship.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 9: The Marshal}}</ref>\n\nSometime later, Djarin returned from his mission, having walked to Mos Eisley after a skirmish left the speeder destroyed. He entered [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], where he met with Motto, who was in the middle of a [[sabacc]] game with \"[[Doctor Mandible]].\" Motto noticed Djarin carrying a set of [[Boba Fett's armor|Mandalorian armor]], snidely inquiring whether or not Djarin had met with the Mandalorian he sought and killed him. Djarin told her that he had simply acquired the armor from its [[Cobb Vanth|owner]] by helping him [[Mission to Tatooine (Din Djarin)|kill]] a [[Krayt dragon|Krayt Dragon]]. Dr. Mandible, hearing the conversation told Motto that he knew a contact who could help Djarin on his quest to find Mandalorians. Motto, translating for Mandible, told Djarin to cover Mandible's call in the game in return for the information. Djarin gave Mandible 500 credits, and Motto assured him that Mandible was on a \"hot streak.\" Motto won the game with an [[Idiot's Array]], but Mandible kept his word and told Motto about the contact, who he said would rendezvous with Motto and Djarin at the hangar.<ref name=\"Chapter 10\">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 10: The Passenger}}</ref>\n\nMotto and Djarin met at the hangar soon afterward, where Motto had a [[WED-15 Treadwell droid|Treadwell droid]] cook the Krayt Dragon meat Djarin had brought with him. Motto told Djarin that Mandible knew of a Mandalorian covert in the sector, and that his contact would bring Djarin to them. Djarin asked whether or not the covert was part of the [[The Tribe|Tribe]] that left [[Nevarro]], but Motto did not know. She added that it wouldn't cost Djarin anything, but he would have to give the contact passage to the [[Trask|system]] without hyperdrive. Djarin protested that traveling sub-light was too dangerous and called off the deal, but Motto vouched for the contact, the \"[[Frog Lady]],\" who had entered the hangar. Translating for the Frog Lady, Motto told Djarin how the only cargo would be the Frog Lady and her spawn, adding that entering hyperspace would kill her eggs. Djarin, still unsure, asked whether or not the Frog Lady was sure that there were Mandalorians at their destination, though all Motto was told was that the Frog Lady's [[Frog Man|husband]] had seen them. Djarin's unsurety was not eased by Motto, who remarked that she did not know the Frog Lady or her husband, but telling him to trust her as she had a \"excellent judge of character.\"<ref name=\"Chapter 10\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|She said her husband has seen them.''\"<br />\"''Do you know the husband?''\"<br />\"''No. I met her ten minutes before you walked in.''\"<br />\"''I thought you said you vouched for her on your life.''\"<br />\"''What can I say, I'm an excellent judge of character.|Peli Motto and the Mandalorian on the Frog Lady|Chapter 10: The Passenger}}\n[[File:Motto-Child-TMS1C5.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Peli Motto cared for the safety of Grogu.]]\nPeli Motto was a female human with fair skin, curly [[Color|brown]] [[hair]], and brown [[eye]]s.<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" /> The proprietor of Mos Eisley hangar bay 3-5, she made a living refueling and repairing ships. Under her ownership were several droids who aided her in her job. She was protective of her droids due to what it would cost to repair them, and consulted them about repair work that needed to be done. Despite relying on her droids to help her she was willing to take on any job herself for an additional fee.<ref name=\"Peli Motto DB\">{{Databank|peli-motto|Peli Motto|archivedate=20201029002247}}</ref> Motto never left the city walls of Mos Eisley following the fall of the Empire, seeing Tatooine as a dangerous free-for-all of bandits. Despite this she knew many people and species, though was unfamiliar with Grogu's kind.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" /> A sabacc player, Motto often played against her droids or in Chalmun's Cantina. She was additionally a skilled translator, able to speak and understand multiple different languages, including [[Galactic Basic Standard]] and [[Frog (language)|Frog]]. During her second encounter with the Mandalorian, she translated both Dr. Mandible and the Frog Lady for him, although she was prone to paraphrasing their words. Motto vouched for the Frog Lady in order to ease the Mandalorian, though admitted that she had known her for only ten minutes and, considering herself an excellent judge of it, simply trusted her sense of character.<ref name=\"Chapter 10\" />\n\nDuring her first encounter with the Mandalorian, Motto complained about the Mandalorian not being able to pay enough up front, but began repair work on his ship before learning that he had been able to acquire paying work. Upon discovering Grogu she cooed over it and cradle them in her arms, making sure they were cared for and fed, but also pleased that she could charge the Mandalorian extra for watching over them. Motto scolded him for leaving it alone and warned that he needed to improve his [[parent]]ing skills. She initially thought of the Mandalorian as a \"[[womp rat]],\" but complimented his strategy during the fight with Calican. After the fight she feared for Grogu's safety, and was relieved to see them unharmed.<ref name=\"Chapter 5\" /> During her second encounter with the Mandalorian, Motto excitedly said that she was glad Grogu was doing well, jokingly asking if she could purchase them. Motto helped the Mandalorian as he tried to find leads on where other Mandalorians could be located, first lending him her speeder after directing him to Mos Pelgo,<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" /> then helping set up his passage of the Frog Lady with Dr. Mandible.<ref name=\"Chapter 10\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|You know, it's costing me a lot of money to keep these droids even powered up.|Motto complains about the upkeep costs of her droids|Chapter 5: The Gunslinger}}\nPeli Motto wore a brown [[Clothing|jumpsuit]] with black and brown [[glove]]s and brown [[boot]]s.
