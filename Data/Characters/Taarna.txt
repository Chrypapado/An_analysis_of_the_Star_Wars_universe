I'll have further details when you arrive.|Agent Taarna, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nTaarna was an agent of the [[Corellian Security Force]] who had a distinguished career prior to the Galactic Civil War. During his time in CorSec, he trained [[Dathnaeya Loessin]] who later became one of CorSec's most promising officers.<ref name=\"ACoA\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=66910&resource=features|text=A Crisis of Allegiance|archivedate=20111124014104}}</ref> By the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Taarna was still on duty, assigned to the city of [[Nashal]], on the planet Talus.<ref name=\"SWG:TtT\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Agent Taarna discovered that a group of [[Talusian Smugglers|local smugglers]] had captured several [[Selonian/Legends|Selonians]] of the [[Neetha Den]] and were keeping them as hostages in order to exploit the rest of the den. However, he was unable to intervene because CorSec could not interfere with Selonians matters. Agent Taarna thus recruited an independent spacer who previously worked with [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vitala Baize|Baize]] in order to help the Selonians without involving the CorSec.<ref name=\"SWG:TtT\" /> The spacer successfully crippled the smugglers and their ability to exploit the Selonians.<ref name=\"SWG:AtDM\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Address the Den Mother|Talus}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DathnaeyaLoessin.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Dathnaeya Loessin]].]]\nBy the same time, the Galactic Civil War between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] was growing ever more intense. Agent Taarna's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Dathnaeya Loessin was facing a personal crisis and believed she could no longer stand on the side without involving herself. However, she did not know which side to take. She discussed her trouble with Taarna but her mentor was not able to help her without harming his position in the CorSec. After the resolution of the crisis between the Selonians and the smugglers, Agent Taarna realized that the spacer who assisted him so efficiently on that case was the best help Dathnaeya could receive. He thus arranged a meeting in [[Dearic]] between the spacer and Dathnaeya.<ref name=\"ACoA\" /><ref name=\"SWG:FA\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Fellow Agent|Talus}}</ref> Dathnaeya then tasked the spacer to work with [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vayde Quellium|Quellium]] and [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Braedic Ekirk|Ekirk]], respectively Rebel and Imperial officers. After achieving several missions for both officers, the spacer made a detailed report to Dathnaeya Loessin who eventually decided to join one of the factions in the Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"SWG:CoA\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Crisis of Allegiance|Talus}}</ref> Her only regret was that her choice would prevent her to work with Taarna again.<ref name=\"ACoA\" />\n\n[[File:AdaptiveBiology-GH.jpg|thumb|right|200px|CorSec spacers discovering a giant arachne in the [[GeneTech Syndicate Lab]].]]\nLater the same year, Agent Taarna led the investigation concerning a [[Starship/Legends|starship]] that crashed in the mountains near Nashal. Taarna dispatched a spacer to investigate the area and rescue any survivors. However, the spacer quickly realized that the crash site was invaded by oversized and aggressive [[arachne]]s. The spacer then found evidences that the ship was carrying [[Bioengineering/Legends|bioengineered]] arachnes. The spacer also discovered that most of the crew members and scientists survived the crash but they were attacked and overwhelmed by the creatures.<ref name=\"SWG:RO\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Rescue Operation|Talus}}</ref> The spacer therefore visited the survivors' camp and only found dead bodies and a damaged droid. [[CV-4T]] narrated the awful events that took place earlier and helped the spacer to locate the rest of the survivors.<ref name=\"SWG:TtC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Tracking the Crew\" on Talus</ref> However, the spacer finally discovered that the other group, including [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Narl (captain)|Narl]], had already been slaughtered by the arachnes.<ref name=\"SWG:GD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Grim Discovery\" on Talus</ref> Agent Taarna later determined that the crashed ship took off from Dearic and a CorSec [[Scout/Legends|scout]] team found a [[GeneTech Syndicate Lab|laboratory]] near Dearic undergoing an emergency evacuation. The lab was owned by the [[GeneTech Syndicate]] and listed as engaging in legitimate genetic manipulation on animal. Nevertheless, Taarna was suspicious and sent spacers out to investigate the laboratory. When the spacers arrived at the lab, they immediately figured out that the building was overrun by bioengineered arachnes and most of the staff had been slaughtered by the creatures. The spacers downloaded data that revealed that the project was dubbed [[Parasophic Arachne]].<ref name=\"SWG:G\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Genocide\" on Talus</ref> Taarna therefore ordered his CorSec crew to clear the lab.<ref name=\"SWG:AB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Adaptive Biology\" on Talus</ref> With the help of [[6-POC]], the project manager's [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]], the spacers managed to delete all scientific data that could be used to restart the program.<ref name=\"SWG:ABLTG\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"A Better Life Through Genetics\" on Talus</ref> They also retrieved a self-destruct intron virus, a virus designed specifically to kill the arachnes, and injected it into every arachne [[Egg/Legends|eggs]] they found in the lab.<ref name=\"SWG:FtS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Find the Source|Talus}}</ref> Agent Taarna eventually tasked the spacer to eliminate the arachne queen, a gigantic arachne responsible for breeding the parasophic arachnes. The destruction of all the breeding arachnes and eggs definitely eliminated the Parasophic Arachne threat. After the planet Talus was saved from the bioenineered arachnes, the CorSec targeted the escaped Genetech Syndicate scientists and filed a complaint with the [[Imperial Research Division]] against the GeneTech Syndicate for carrying out class 5 biological experiments on an inhabited world. Nevertheless, Agent Taarna was very pessimistic about the chances of success of this investigation.<ref name=\"SWG:G\" />\n\nTaarna later sent the spacers who helped him to work with his old friend [[Jornel Savas]], a Corsec agent on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]].<ref name=\"SWG:CtCA\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Contact the Corsec Agent|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTaarna appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TtT\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Taarna was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=66910&resource=features|text=A Crisis of Allegiance|archivedate=20111124014104}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=66911&resource=features|text=Genetic Potential|archivedate=20061119061852}}\n*{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/posts/list.m?topic_id=976424|text=Game Update 12: Engineering Trader|archivedate=20090816090206}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=68410&month=082009|text=The Quest Continues|archivedate=20111124005620}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|CorSec agent Taarna}}\n\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Talusians]]"}}}]}}}}
