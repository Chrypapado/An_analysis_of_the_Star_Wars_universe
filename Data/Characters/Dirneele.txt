She had dark hair and eyes, but used wigs and eye implants to change her appearance for her performances. In [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], she longed to find a better job or at least a better club, but was under contract until [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]]. She usually knew what was going on in Tindark's underworld.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
