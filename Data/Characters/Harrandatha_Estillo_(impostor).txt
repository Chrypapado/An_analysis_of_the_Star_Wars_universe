Brainwashed into believing he was Estillo by circuitry contained within Estillo's signet ring, he served [[Leonia Tavira]], [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] of Eiattu 6, as a pawn and lover. In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], he emerged, claiming that he was Estillo&mdash;who in fact had been killed as a boy during the [[Priamsta]]'s execution of the royal family&mdash;and claiming the right to rule in opposition to the nobles of the Priamsta. Posing as a champion of the common people, he raised the [[People's Liberation Battalion]] to battle the Priamsta and the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] forces&mdash;and to secretly steal the planet's wealth for Tavira to abscond with it. He was exposed by Princess [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo]], who had survived the purge and returned to Eiattu 6 on hearing of the impostor's campaign, and had a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shot hit his hand, destroying the ring. He was reduced to a state of incomprehension, his memories and mind lost.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 16|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 16]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' {{Imo}} {{C|Under ''Asrandatha Estillo''}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Estillo, Harrandatha}}\n[[Category:Eiattuans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial warlord personnel]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
