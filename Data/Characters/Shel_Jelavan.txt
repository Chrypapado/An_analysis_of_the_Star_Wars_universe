You killed my brother!|Zayne Carrick and Shel Jelavan|Knights of the Old Republic 23}}\n'''Shel Jelavan''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who lived in the [[Middle City]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] prior to the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. She, along with her brothers [[Shad Jelavan|Shad]] and [[Shay Jelavan|Shay]], was orphaned when her parents [[Death/Legends|died]] in an accident. The family suffered a further loss when Shad, who had been training as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], was killed in the [[Padawan Massacre|Padawan Massacre of Taris]]. The murders were blamed on Jelavan's friend, the former [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Zayne Carrick]], and she became determined to see him pay for his crimes.\n\nAfter the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] invasion of Taris, Jelavan joined the [[Taris Resistance]] and finally got her chance for vengeance when [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Raana Tey]] informed her that the fugitive Carrick was returning to Taris. Jelavan and Tey saw their opportunity to kill Carrick when he joined them on a mission to infiltrate the [[Jedi Tower]] in an attempt to assassinate the [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Mandalorian Neo-Crusader]] [[Cassus Fett]]. Jelavan intended to kill Carrick with her brother's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], but upon learning that it was Tey and the other members of the [[Jedi Covenant]] who killed her brother, stabbed the Jedi Master with the weapon, saving Carrick's life. Jelavan left Taris soon after, to take [[Constable/Legends|Constable]] [[Noana Sowrs]]'s children safely to [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. When she heard that Carrick was in trouble on the Mandalorian [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Jebble]], she joined several of his friends in a mission to rescue him, and agreed to help him clear his name.\n\nCarrick's quest for vindication led him and his friends to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and a final showdown with the Covenant. With his name cleared, Carrick departed but Jelavan decided to remain on Coruscant, working with [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Haydel Goravvus]] to help refugees throughout the Republic. In this role she assisted Carrick during his fight with [[The Crucible]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaver]] organization.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nShel Jelavan was a native of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] in the years following the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], living in the [[Middle City]] area of the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] with her brothers, [[Shad Jelavan|Shad]] and [[Shay Jelavan|Shay]], and their parents.<ref name=\"Commencement 6\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 6|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 6]]</ref> At some point in her youth, the elder of her brothers, Shad, was taken in for [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] training at the [[Jedi Tower|Taris Academy]] and went on to become the most promising [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] in his class.<ref name=\"Crossroads\">''[[The Taris Holofeed: Prime Edition]]''</ref> During this time, Jelavan caught the attention of her brother's fellow Padawan and close friend, [[Zayne Carrick]], who developed an emotional attachment to her.<ref name=\"Commencement 1\" /> Jelavan was also attracted to Carrick, but, knowing that there could be no future to their relationship if he successfully became a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], she did not act on her feelings, and the two became merely friends.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 3\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 24|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 24]]</ref>\n\n===Family tragedy===\nIn [[3966 BBY/Legends|3966 BBY]], Jelavan suffered a personal tragedy when her parents were killed in an accident in the Middle City, leaving her and her two brothers orphaned.<ref name=\"Crossroads\" /> Despite the family's loss, Shad continued to excel at his studies, and by [[3964 BBY]] had completed the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]] and was set to be knighted at a private ceremony in the Jedi Tower. Since the Padawans' families were not permitted to attend the ceremony, the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] invited them to a banquet earlier in the day, and Shel attended the meal along with her brothers. She was present in the banquet hall when Carrick came crashing through the window during a failed attempt to capture the [[Snivvian/Legends|Snivvian]] criminal [[Marn Hierogryph]], and was concerned that the incident might have affected Carrick's chances of knighthood.<ref name=\"Commencement 1\" />\n\n[[File:JelavansAngryMob.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Shel and Shay Jelavan watch as Zayne Carrick is led through Patrol Plaza.]]\nThe rest of the event passed without incident, and Shad escorted his siblings home before returning for the knighting ceremony.<ref name=\"Commencement 6\" /> Later that evening, Jelavan learned that her brother, along with three other Padawans, had been killed during the ceremony. News of the [[Padawan Massacre|Padawan Massacre of Taris]] spread quickly, with major news channels reporting that the authorities had named Carrick as the perpetrator, and both of the surviving Jelavans were interviewed about their brother's death.<ref name=\"Commencement 2\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 2|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 2]]</ref> The day after the Padawan Massacre, the Jedi Masters removed their formers students' [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] [[Lightsaber crystal|crystals]] from their weapons and had them sent to the families. Jelavan had her brother's crystal turned into a necklace, which she would later wear to remember him.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" /> Carrick, meanwhile, initially evaded capture by both the Taris Academy's Jedi Masters and the [[Taris Civil Authority]], escaping the planet before eventually turning himself in to the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Valius Ying]]. Jelavan and her younger brother were present in the crowd of onlookers in [[Patrol Plaza]] as Carrick was returned to Taris to face justice.<ref name=\"Commencement 6\" />\n\nSome time later, Jelavan was sent some [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]], which she assumed had come from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. With the growing [[Mandalorian Wars|threat]] posed by the [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders]], Jelavan used the money to pay for the family she and her brother had been staying with to take Shay to [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] so he could live in safety with their grandparents. Although there was enough money for Jelavan to accompany her brother, she decided to use the rest of the money to put a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on Carrick's head, after the former Padawan had once again escaped custody and fled Taris. However, before she was able to set up the bounty, the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] invaded Taris.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" />\n\n===Reunion===\n{{Quote|He's coming here.''\"<br />\"''How can you tell?''\"<br />\"''I knew he would. I see him every time I close my eyes. It's why I took this assignment. Will you be ready? Can you do the thing you say you want to do?''\"<br />\"''I&mdash;I will. I have to. I see him every time I close my eyes, too.|Raana Tey and Shel Jelavan discuss Carrick's return to Taris|Knights of the Old Republic 22}}\nStuck on her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], Jelavan joined the fledgling [[Taris Resistance]] led by [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Haydel Goravvus]].<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" /> However, she was haunted by Zayne's supposed crime against her brother. Carrick eventually returned to Taris to link up with Marn Hierogryph, who had become friends with the fugitive Padawan since helping him during his first escape and was now fighting the Mandalorians. When the [[Jedi Covenant]] learned of his return, Jelavan was approached by Jedi Master [[Raana Tey]], who persuaded her that this gave her the opportunity to kill Carrick and avenge her brother's death. Jelavan agreed, and soon got her chance when Carrick arrived at the Resistance base with the [[Hidden Beks]] [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gang]] to negotiate an alliance with the Resistance. Seeing the renegade Padawan, Jelavan charged towards him and fired at him with her [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]].<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 1\" /> Carrick was saved when the case he was carrying took the brunt of the shot,<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" /> but he was still knocked to the ground unconscious by the attack. As an emotional Jelavan stepped over the body of the man she believed had killed her brother, Tey emerged from the watching crowd and told her to finish him off.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 1\" />\n\n[[File:Shelblamzayne.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Jelavan shoots Zayne Carrick.]]\nHowever, Zayne's bounty was already \"claimed\" by the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] bounty hunter [[Del Moomo]], who attempted to stop Jelavan. Seeing Moomo, Tey moved to attack him due to the [[Moomo Brothers]]' earlier failure to capture Carrick for her on [[Telerath/Legends|Telerath]]. The confrontation distracted Jelavan, and she was then disarmed by Hierogryph. While the Hidden Beks and the Resistance initially raised their weapons, Senator Goravvus ordered them to back down when the Hidden Beks produced [[Constable/Legends|Constable]] [[Noana Sowrs]]'s children, who had been missing until Carrick had located them. Convinced that Carrick was not an immediate threat and that the Resistance needed all the help they could get, the senator agreed to let the Hidden Beks join his cause. Jelavan and Tey both argued that they wanted justice for the Padawan Massacre, but relented after Goravvus insisted that defeating the Mandalorians was their top priority.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" />\n\nDuring Carrick's stay at the Resistance base, Jelavan did her best to avoid him. When Carrick finally confronted her, he asked where her brother was and told her that ''he'' had sent her the money, though she refused to believe him. Carrick was disconsolate to learn that she had attempted to put a bounty on him, given their history, but Jelavan became enraged at his assumption that they could ever have a relationship after the death of her brother. Despite Carrick's, as well as Hierogryph's, protests of innocence, Jelavan was still unconvinced that her former friend was not responsible for Shad's death. The entrance of Raana Tey into their conversation did not improve matters, as she only continued to place blame on Carrick by making claims that he had fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Frustrated at both parties, Shel left the room, wishing she had never met any of them.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" />\n\n===Mission to the Jedi Tower===\n{{Quote|You were trying to become a Jedi. I might not have seen you again. What future&mdash;''\"<br />\"''Oh, come on. We both knew I'd flunk out. It was thinking about you that made that not seem so horrible.

No, you were doing everything you could to become a knight and avoid that!|Shel Jelavan and Zayne Carrick|Knights of the Old Republic 24}}\n[[File:Shelkisszyane.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Jelavan and Zayne Carrick]]\nThe Resistance soon learned that the Mandalorian [[Field Marshal]] [[Cassus Fett]] was present in the Jedi Tower to review the Mandalorian operations, and they planned to destroy the Tower in order to kill him. However, Goravvus feared using up munitions if Fett was not there, and a reconnaissance mission was planned for the same day as the assault to make certain. Carrick volunteered for the mission due to his familiarity with the Jedi Tower, but Constable Sowrs still did not trust him, so Jelavan volunteered as well. Goravvus was concerned for the young woman's safety, but Jelavan was one of the few present who had previously visited the Tower, and explained that she had some bad memories to put to rest there. Seeing their opportunity, Raana Tey agreed to accompany them on the mission, under the guise of wanting to protect Jelavan from both the Mandalorians and Carrick. Goravvus agreed and the group was also charged with opening the Tower's ventilation shaft to allow Hidden Beks leader [[Gadon Thek]]'s assault team to enter.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" />\n\nAfter the plan was finalized, Tey pulled Jelavan aside and explained that she had [[Force vision/Legends|foreseen]] that she may not live to kill Carrick. If she failed, she asked Jelavan to promise to finish the job and kill the former Padawan. Though Carrick would be on his guard, Tey instructed Jelavan to locate her brother's lightsaber, which was stored in the Tower, and to reinsert his lightsaber crystal before using it against Carrick. The Jedi Master promised that Jelavan would have justice one way or another.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 2\" />\n\n[[File:Raana_stabbed.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Jelavan stabs Raana Tey.]]\nThe [[Togruta/Legends|Togruta]] Tey was too conspicuous to enter the Tower from the Mandalorian-controlled [[Upper City]], so she proceeded to the foundations and entered through the ventilation shaft. Though Jelavan would have preferred to accompany the Jedi Master, she was unable to negotiate the vertical shaft and was instead forced to join Carrick. Once infiltrating the Tower, they would open the vent and rendezvous with Tey before proceeding. Carrick was to enter the Tower disguised as a Mandalorian, with Jelavan posing as a saboteur being taken in for questioning. The trip to the Jedi Tower took them through Patrol Plaza, and when Jelavan brought up Carrick's last trip through to the Tower, the two began to argue. Carrick told her his version of events on the night of Shad's death, blaming the Jedi Masters for the Padawan Massacre in a misguided attempt to stop their apprentices from joining the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. The commotion attracted the attention of a group of Mandalorian soldiers who approached them to investigate. Upon being confronted by the Mandalorians, Jelavan acted quickly, kissing Carrick and causing the group to mistake them for lovers and move on. Though she still did not trust Carrick, Jelavan put her personal feelings aside, and the two entered the Tower.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 3\" />\n\nOnce she and Carrick infiltrated the Tower, they made their way to the storage floor, where Carrick cycled the vent locks to allow Tey to enter. Jelavan used the distraction to locate her brother's lightsaber and install the crystal. However, before she could use it against him, he started to tell her about his friendship with her brother, which ultimately caused him to break down crying. Seeing how much Carrick missed Shad, Jelavan's doubts about his guilt grew, and she could not bring herself to kill him. Not willing to wait for Tey, Carrick went on alone while Jelavan stayed to wait for the Jedi Master. When Tey arrived and saw the lightsaber, she was furious that Jelavan had not taken the chance to kill Carrick. Deciding to take matters into her own hands, Tey ran off to find him, telling Jelavan to wait. Jelavan, however, decided to follow the Jedi Master. She caught up with them just in time to hear Tey, standing with her lightsaber drawn over a defenseless Carrick, confess to her part in the murder of Shad and the other Padawans. Realizing that Carrick was telling the truth, Jelavan saved him by stabbing Tey through the back with her brother's lightsaber. The two had a tearful reconciliation before being rescued from the Tower by the arrival of Thek and Hierogryph on a [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]]. Though the group attempted to save Tey, the Jedi Master was killed when the temple exploded.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 3\" />\n\nCassus Fett was not killed in the explosion, having already left the Jedi Tower before the Resistance attack. Furthermore, the Mandalorians had used the attack to launch a major strike at the Resistance base. Despite the failure of the mission, Jelavan had come to accept that Carrick did not kill her brother, and could begin to move past her loss.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 3\" />\n\n===Escape from Taris===\nThe Mandalorians' surprise attack struck a heavy blow to the Resistance. Before the group retreated to the [[rakghoul]] infested [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]], Constable Sowrs paid Del Moomo to fly her children safely to her husband in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] aboard his [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the ''[[Moomo Williwaw]]''. The ship had room for only one more passenger and, since Senator Goravvus wouldn't leave and Sowrs would not leave him,<ref name=\"Vector 1\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 25|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 25]]</ref> she asked Jelavan to go instead.<ref name=\"Vector 4\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 28|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 28]]</ref>\n\nThough he remained on Taris, Carrick contacted his friends, the [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] [[Jarael]], the Mandalorian [[Rohlan Dyre]], the Jedi [[Darth Malak|Alek]] and the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slyssk]], to ask them to help Jelavan locate the children's father. After rendezvousing with the group, and Moomo's brother [[Dob Moomo|Dob]], Jelavan and the others took the children safely to [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. There, they received word from Carrick. Since Jelavan left Taris, Carrick and Hierogryph had traveled to [[Jebble]] with Jedi Covenant agent [[Celeste Morne]], in pursuit of the ancient Sith artifact, the [[Muur Talisman]], which had fallen into Mandalorian hands. On Jebble, the power of the Talisman had become clear when it started to transform the Mandalorians into mindless rakghouls which could be controlled by its owner, and the creatures soon threatened to overrun the planet. The ''Moomo Williwaw'' headed quickly to Jebble, arriving just in time to rescue Carrick and Hierogryph from a group of Rakghouls. The group escaped moments before Cassus Fett's forces arrived and [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombarded]] the planet to prevent the [[Rakghoul plague|plague]] from spreading. Morne, however, was believed to be killed in the bombardment.<ref name=\"Vector 4\" />\n\nDistraught at the further loss of life around him, Carrick resolved to take down the Jedi Covenant and clear his name. To this end he planned to locate [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Krynda Draay]], mother of his former master [[Lucien Draay]], and leader of the Jedi Covenant. When Carrick asked for Alek's help, Jelavan offered her services too, along with the rest of the crew.<ref name=\"Vector 4\" />\n\n===Clearing Carrick's name===\n[[File:ShelMalakTokare-KotOR31.png|thumb|left|170px|Jelavan and Alek meet with Vandare Tokare on Coruscant]]\nWhile Carrick led some of the group to a Covenant facility on [[Odryn]], Jelavan and Alek contacted [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] members [[Vrook Lamar]] and [[Vandar Tokare]] with news of the recent events on Jebble and arranged to meet them in a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] on Coruscant. Their journey was hampered by an arrest order for Alek, due to his involvement in the Mandalorian Wars, forcing him to travel under the alias [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] Malak. However, the two were able to reach Coruscant safely and proceeded to the cantina to wait for the Jedi Masters. Though they were skeptical, the two Jedi Masters eventually arrived for the meeting and allowed Jelavan and Alek to make their case.<ref name=\"Turnabout\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 31|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 31]]</ref>\n\nThe two explained that Carrick would soon be coming to Coruscant with proof&mdash;a collection of Sith artifacts collected by the Covenant on Odryn. Tokare remained open-minded about the allegations, but Lamar feared that they could tear the Jedi Order apart. Nevertheless, after Jelavan and Alek received a signal from Carrick, both Jedi agreed to meet with the fugitive. The group left the cantina and headed to their rendezvous with Carrick only to discover that he and Hierogryph had been captured by Covenant member [[Xamar]].<ref name=\"Turnabout\" /> However, instead of taking the captives to the Covenant, Xamar agreed to testify before the Jedi Council. With the help of Xamar and the Jedi, Carrick confronted the Covenant leaders.<ref name=\"Vindication 1\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 32|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 32]]</ref> In the ensuing [[Vindication|confrontation]], the Covenant were defeated and Carrick's name was cleared, though he chose not to rejoin the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Vindication 4\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 35|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 35]]</ref>\n\n===The Rogue Moon Project===\n{{Quote|You don't mess around, do you Zayne? You just find all the public enemies and bring them home for dinner&hellip;|Shel Jelavan|Knights of the Old Republic 48}}\nLearning that Senator Goravvus had escaped Taris and was now on Coruscant, Jelavan decided to remain on the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world and assist the senator.<ref name=\"Destroyer 2\" /> Both she and Carrick were concerned that, with everybody's attention focused on the Mandalorian Wars, nobody was looking out for the rights and well being of individuals within the Republic. After negotiations with Republic officials, Carrick purchased a [[Rogue Moon Project Command|garage]] on Coruscant and the two set about bringing together the families of the Taris Padawans, establishing the [[Rogue Moon Project]] to help refugees of the war, wrongly accused fugitives and any other [[Sentience/Legends|sentients]] in need of assistance. Before long, Carrick departed Coruscant to join up with Hierogryph on [[Metellos/Legends|Metellos]], leaving Jelavan and the others&mdash;[[Gharn's father]], [[Kamlin's sister]] and [[Oojoh's grandfather]]&mdash;to run the Rogue Moon Project while he worked as a field agent.<ref name=\"Demon 2\" />\n\nOver the coming months, the group fed intelligence gained by Jelavan through her work with the senator to Carrick. On one occasion, this information led Carrick to the [[Luxury yacht/Legends|luxury yacht]] ''[[Chancellor Fillorean]]''<ref name=\"Demon 2\" /> and a confrontation with the serial killer known as the [[Toki Tollivar|Corellian Strangler]].<ref name=\"Faithful Execution\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 38|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 38]]</ref> Carrick, in turn, provided them with the proceeds of his adventures, allowing the garage on Coruscant to be converted into a headquarters for the organization. During this time, Jelavan also arranged for a specialist to fuse the lightsaber crystals of the Taris Padawans together for use in a new lightsaber for Carrick. As a memorial to those who died, the names of Shad and the other Padawans were etched on the hilt.<ref name=\"Demon 2\" />\n\n[[File:Zayne-Shel.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Jelavan and Carrick at the Rogue Moon Project Command]]\n\nJelavan later provided Carrick with reports of missing travelers,<ref name=\"Destroyer 2\" /> which led him to [[Jervo's World]] and into conflict with the [[Slavery/Legends|slave-trading]] organization known as [[The Crucible]].<ref name=\"Dueling Ambitions 3\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 41|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 41]]</ref> Learning that Jarael had once been kidnapped by the organization and forced to work for them, Carrick resolved to bring down the Crucible<ref name=\"Masks\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 42|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 42]]</ref> and initiated a plan to let himself be captured by the organization and lead his allies to their location. However, when the Crucible discovered and deactivated Carrick's [[Homing beacon/Legends|tracking device]],<ref name=\"Destroyer 1\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 45|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 45]]</ref> Carrick's [[Droid/Legends|droid]], [[T1-LB]], put Jarael into contact with Jelavan. Jelavan was able to provide intelligence indicating that the Crucible were present on [[Volgax]], where Jarael managed to locate Carrick. However, the Crucible had already departed.<ref name=\"Destroyer 2\" />\n\nJarael later traveled to [[Osadia]] with the [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] [[Demagol|Antos Wyrick]], her former mentor<ref name=\"Demon 2\" /> who had been posing as Rohlan Dyre. When Carrick realized Wyrick's deception and that the Zeltron was actually the Mandalorian war criminal Demagol, he and Hierogryph rescued the real Dyre, who was to stand trial for Demagol's crimes, from Republic custody<ref name=\"Demon 1\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 47|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 47]]</ref> in the hopes of recruiting him to help rescue Jarael. Jelavan was attending a [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senatorial]] dinner party when she was contacted by Slyssk and taken to meet Carrick and the others at Rogue Moon Project Command. Since neither Carrick or Dyre knew how to find Osadia, Carrick hoped to extract the location from the slaver [[Dace Golliard]], who had previous dealings with Demagol.<ref name=\"Demon 2\" />\n\nWith Golliard in hiding with the rest of the Crucible, Carrick needed to find a way to draw him out.<ref name=\"Demon 2\" /> Jelavan was able to discover a connection between Golliard and Republic [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]], whose father had been among those who died when Golliard, then a Republic officer himself, abandoned the [[Foerost Shipyards]] during the Great Sith War.<ref name=\"Demon 3\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 49|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 49]]</ref> Jelavan provided Carrick with information on fleet positions and used the senator's contacts to set up a call between Dyre and Cassus Fett.<ref name=\"Demon 2\" /> Fett also hoped to see Demagol pay for his actions and agreed to help Carrick by feinting an attack on an [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] [[Mining/Legends|mining]] facility near the [[Ottega system/Legends|Ithor system]]. An anonymous tip to the [[Ministry of Defense]] ensured that Karath's forces were waiting for the Mandalorians' arrival, while Fett ensured that an unscrambled signal announcing their intentions was intercepted by Golliard. Taking the bait, Golliard headed to the mining facility in the hopes of capturing slaves during the battle, only to be captured himself by Karath. As Carrick had hoped, the captive slaver soon revealed the location of Osadia,<ref name=\"Demon 3\" /> and he was able to rescue Jarael from Demagol's control.<ref name=\"Demon 4\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 50|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 50]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Shad was my best friend&mdash;and your brother.

Although each wanted to pursue a relationship, Jelavan was concerned that there would be no future for them together if Carrick became a Jedi Knight. For his part, Carrick was certain that he would fail, leaving him free to be with her,<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 3\" /> and his fellow Padawans even joked that his apparent ineptitude was just a ruse to stay on Taris with her.<ref name=\"Commencement 1\" /> However, Jelavan saw him as trying everything he could to become a Jedi and avoid spending his life with her, and came to think of herself as little more than a consolation prize.<ref name=\"Knights of Suffering 3\" />\n\nFollowing her parents' death, Shad's murder, and Carrick's implication in it, Jelavan was left confused and angry.

Miller has stated that he considered expanding the scene to more closely follow the previous one, but realized that this was secondary to the story.<ref>{{Faraway|url=comics/swknights/swkotor24.html|text=''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic #24''|archivedate=20170211121429}}</ref>\n\nFollowing ''Knights of Suffering'', ''Knights of the Old Republic'' began a new [[Star Wars: Vector|story arc]]. Though Miller was aware that what became of Jelavan was of interest to fans, he was also conscious of the need for a fresh story in [[Knights of the Old Republic 25|''Vector, Part 1'']] and Jelavan was excluded from the issue.<ref>{{Faraway|url=comics/swknights/swkotor25.html|text=''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic #25''|archivedate=20170211080433}}</ref> However, the issue did refer to a woman taking Constable Sowrs's children to safety and this was later identified as Jelavan when the character returned in [[Knights of the Old Republic 28|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 28]].<ref name=\"Vector 1\" /><ref name=\"Vector 4\" />\n\nJelavan next appeared, in voice only, in [[Knights of the Old Republic 46|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 46]], when she is contacted by Jarael after Carrick is captured by the Crucible.<ref name=\"Destroyer 2\" /> Miller originally considered making the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Destroyer|''Destroyer'']] arc last for three issues, but with the decision to end ''Knights of the Old Republic''{{'s}} run with [[Knights of the Old Republic 50|issue 50]], he reduced it to two issues to allow four issues for the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Demon|final arc]]. This resulted in cuts to some planned scenes, including conversations between Jarael, Jelavan, and Malak, which Miller felt diluted the impact of Carrick's story.<ref>{{Faraway|url=comics/swknights/swkotor46.html|text=''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic #46''|archivedate=20170211193525}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Shel Jelavan}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 1|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 2|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 2]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 6|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 6]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 22|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 22]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 23|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 23]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 24|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 24]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 25|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 25]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 28|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 28]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 29|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 29]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 31|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 31]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 42|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 42]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 46|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 46]] {{Voice}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 48|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 48]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 49|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 49]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Shel Jelavan\n|es=Shel Jelavan\n|pl=Shel Jelavan\n|esFA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jelavan, Shel}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
