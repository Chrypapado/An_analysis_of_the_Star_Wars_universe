The widow of [[Dannar Calwell]], she was also the mother of [[Kallie Calwell|Kallie]] and [[Jabe Calwell|Jabe]], and a friend of [[Leelee Pace]].

Kenobi's oddity intrigued her initially. Through brief but eventful interactions, she developed feelings for Kenobi. However, after a showdown involving Orrin's posse, she found her position in the oasis untenable due to her perceived connection with Orrin, who had embezzled the oasis.\n\nThough she had hoped her future would involve Obi-wan, he prepared Annileen and her family to leave Tatooine immediately. She learned that her old college application was mysteriously accepted by the [[University of Alderaan/Legends|University of Alderaan]], which was a dream of her younger years.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']] {{1st|[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|pt=Legends:Annileen Calwell\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calwell, Annileen}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
