She was a good cook with a warm smile on her broad, plain face.\n\nAfter the Empire took over Bellassa, her business dwindled. She would occasionally provide a meal to the orphan [[Trever Flume]].\n\nWhile she provided some small talk to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], she ended the conversation when Obi-Wan began to ask about her former neighbors, [[Olin and Lands]]. In order to protect her establishment, she kicked Obi-Wan out when stormtroopers raided a nearby art gallery.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: The Desperate Mission]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Bellassans]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
