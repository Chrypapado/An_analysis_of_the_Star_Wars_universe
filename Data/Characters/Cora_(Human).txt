Contact Cora.

Cora was ordered by Captain Jark to investigate the crash.<ref name=\"SWG:WHtD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|What Happened to Donovan?|Corellia}}</ref> However, the ship was also carrying medical equipment for the merchant [[Sinis]]. Sinis thus recruited a spacer to investigate the ship crash site and retrieve some equipment. The spacer discovered that a criminal organization known as the [[Deflarians]] modified the ship's flight recorder and stole a part of the cargo.<ref name=\"SWG:CaB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Crash and Burn|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DonovanCrash-SWG.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The crash site.]]\nInspector Cora therefore ordered the spacer to return to the Deflarian camp were the spacer found Sinis' medical equipment. From a scan of the area, Cora identified a courier who was used by the Deflarians for deliveries between camps. The spacer followed the courier until they arrived to the [[Deflarian bunker]]. The spacer infiltrated the bunker and found the imprisoned Captain Donovan. The spacer therefore killed [[Vinros]], several Deflarian henchmen and a Deflarian underboss to liberate Donovan.<ref name=\"SWG:WHtD\" /> Donovan later revealed that his ship was hijacked by the Deflarians who then crashed a ship of the same model than Donovan's to cover the theft of the cargo. Cora thus tasked spacers to assault another Deflarian camp, whose location was provided by Donovan. During the raid, the spacers killed several Deflarian guards and mechanics, as well as the Deflarian leader [[Deflaros]] and his bodyguards, and finally managed to secure Donovan's ship and its cargo.<ref name=\"SWG:DC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Deflarian Cleanup|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCora was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:SwC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Cora was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 28 Notes for April 26, 2006|Publish 28]]\", on [[April 26]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 28 Update Notes, April 26th|archivedate=20060427125323}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Speak with Cora}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cora}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
