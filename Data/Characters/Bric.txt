He held the rank of [[Master Chief]].<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" />\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|This particular unit seems to have some trouble. What do you recommend?''\"<br />\"''Well, I'm no Jedi, so forgive my bluntness, but I say they fail. Send them down to maintenance with 99 and the other rejects.|Shaak Ti and Bric|Clone Cadets}}\nBric was a [[Siniteen]] bounty hunter hired by the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]] to train various [[clone cadet]]s. In [[Tipoca City]], Bric worked with fellow bounty hunter [[El-Les]] as [[Master Chief]] as they oversaw clone trooper training.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" />\n\nWhen dealing with a particular clone cadet squad called [[Domino Squad]], Bric was very impatient with their struggles. He began to give up hope and told El-Les that they would never become competent soldiers. When Domino Squad attempted to conquer the [[Citadel Challenge]], Bric was highly critical of their inability to function as a unit and later had to break up a fight between troopers [[CT-782]] and [[Echo|CT-1409]] in the barracks.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" />\n\nThe next day Bric and El-Les rallied Domino Squad and other cadet units on a hangar deck to take a lesson from the [[ARC Troopers]] of [[Rancor Battalion]]. Commander [[Colt]] addressed the troopers and watched the next attempt at the Citadel Challenge. Bric praised the first group, [[Bravo Squad]], and told Colt that Domino Squad was inept. They watched as the group failed the test again, much to Bric's amusement. That night, he chewed out clone trooper [[CT-4040]], saying that he was \"a real cutup\" and blamed him for his squad's struggles. Much to his dismay, CT-4040 took the nickname \"Cutup\" and drew inspiration from the criticism.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" />\n\nWhen [[Jedi Master]] [[Shaak Ti]] came to personally oversee Domino Squad's progress and next attempt at the Citadel Challenge, Bric decided to set back Domino Squad further by removing their [[Ascension gun|ascension cables]] so they could not climb the citadel at the end of the challenge. When El-Les learned of his actions, he told the Jedi to stop the test, but Domino Squad pulled together and conquered the challenge despite the setback, much to the chagrin of Bric. Nevertheless, the Siniteen was also impressed.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Clone Cadets}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|Fugitive}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode301.html|text=The Clone Wars Episode Guide: Clone Cadets|archivedate=20110630094215}}\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/clone-cadets-episode-guide|text=\"Clone Cadets\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/fugitive-episode-guide|text=\"Fugitive\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Three|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' The Complete Season Three]]\n*{{SWE|groups|clonetroopers|clone troopers}}\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]\n*{{SWCT|Bric - Base Series 4|Bric - ''Base Series 4''}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|8|Databank A-Z|Bric&ndash;C-3PO}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{Databank|arc-trooper-fives|ARC Trooper Fives|archivedate=20190424013015}} {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Bric\n|ja=\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Kamino residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Siniteen]]"}}}]}}}}
