In [[3956 BBY]], he was assigned as an [[Jedi investigator/Legends|investigator]] for the [[Death/Legends|murder]] of [[Calder Nettic]] and received assistance from an [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]. The two were able to deduce the timeline of Nettic's death, as well as the culprits, two men named [[Handon Guld]] and [[Rickard Lusoff]]. Following the investigation's conclusion, Bolook formally charged the men and escorted them to the [[Jedi Enclave holding facilities|Enclave's holding facilities]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|Though you are not a full Jedi, perhaps you could assist me in sorting out the truth from the lies.|Bolook to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nBolook was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] who lived during the [[Old Sith Wars]]. As some point, he was discovered by the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|force-sensitive]], and was initiated into the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]].

But both also accuse the other. It is most perplexing.|Bolook to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n====Prelude====\nDuring Bolook's time on the planet in [[3956 BBY]],<ref name= \"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> a [[Human/Legends|Human]] male [[Colonist/Legends|colonist]] named [[Calder Nettic]] lived on Dantooine with his [[Calder Nettic's wife|wife]]. Nettic ran a surface to [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] transportation service with another colonist by the name of [[Rickard Lusoff]], whom he had known for over twenty [[Standard year/Legends|years]].  However, after a business deal, Lusoff believed that Nettic had cheated him out of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], and began to fester a grudge. At one point, the two found themselves at a [[Garang spaceport cantina|cantina]] attached to a [[Garang Spaceport|spaceport]] in [[Garang]], Dantooine's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]], and began drinking. Eventually, they got into a drunken altercation, and a Jedi named [[Tooka (Jedi)|Tooka]] was dispatched to the cantina to resolve the conflict. This incident was recorded in the [[Garang archives|archives]] of both the Capital and Enclave. Concurrently, Nettic rented a [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] several times with a man name [[Handon Guld]], information that had also been recorded. At some point, Nettic began to have an [[Reproduction/Legends|affair]] with [[Handon Guld's wife|Guld's wife]], which Guld eventually found out about. Both Lusoff and Guld felt wronged, and they individually planned to murder Nettic.\n\n====The Murder====\n{{Quotetrans|According to the accounts of the participants, these three men were out here in the field together earlier, before the clouds broke. I find that very odd for most people would find shelter indoors when the sky is filled with dark stormclouds as it was earlier today. But that is not the most puzzling aspect of this case.|Bolook to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:CalderNetticCrimeScene.png|thumb|left|250px|The scene of Calder Nettic's murder]]\nOn a cloudy morning,<ref name=\"kotor\" /> several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] after the [[Destruction of Taris|destruction]] of the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|Urban]] planet of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]],<ref name=\"Murder time\">In ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]],'' the player heads to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] immediately following the [[Destruction of Taris|destruction]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. After one [[Standard day/Legends|day]] spent overnight, [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] began his [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. Upon completing his initial training, [[Zhar Lestin]] remarked that Revan had \"done in [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] what many can not do in [[Standard year/Legends|years]].\" Following the completion of his training, Revan moved to his [[Jedi Initiate Trials|initiate trials]], where he gained access to the [[Ancient Grove]], and subsequently encounters the scene of the murder, which had taken place a few [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] earlier, according to [[Bolook]].</ref> at the hands of [[Darth Malak]]'s Sith Empire, Calder Nettic was out in an [[Ancient Grove]] near the Jedi Enclave. Handon Guld and Rickard Lusoff both individually knew Nettic would be out on the plains and stalked him, intending to ambush him. Guld confronted Nettic at a bridge over a small river, delivering a single fatal shot to Nettic's torso. However, at the same time, Lusoff was stalking Nettic with a [[hunting rifle]] from the brush. From a distance, Lusoff believed that Guld was Nettic and fired. The shot hit Guld in the side of his abdomen, causing him to drop his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], now covered in his own [[Blood/Legends|blood]]. Lusoff ran out of the brush, injuring himself in the process. Guld, believing he was about to be killed, quickly hit his [[emergency button]] and called the Jedi Enclave.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n====The Investigation====\n{{Quotetrans|By assisting me with this case you may learn much about how well you have learned the wisdom of the Jedi... or how much further you have yet to go.|Bolook to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:InvestigationDantooine.png|thumb|right|250px|Bolook investigates the murder.]]\nReceiving Guld's call, the Jedi Enclave sent Bolook to handle the situation. Bolook arrived on the scene with a [[Analysis droid/Legends|information droid]] and sent the blaster for analysis, along with the sample of Guld's blood that was on it. While investigating, Bolook held the two suspects at the scene, intending to complete the investigation on site.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nAround three [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] later, an [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], with the personality of a [[Republic soldier]], was completing his third [[Jedi Initiate Trials|initiate trial]], given to him by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zhar Lestin]] of the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Enclave's council]]. Revan was to cleanse a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark]] taint from the grove, being that of the fallen [[Padawan/Legends|padawan]] [[Juhani]], although he did not know its identity at the time. While completing his trial, he passed by the crime scene, getting the attention of Bolook. Bolook approached Revan, and asked him to assist him on the case, believing it would be a good way to further Revan's [[Jedi training/Legends|training]]. Revan agreed to assist, and was debriefed on the situation by Bolook and the [[Droid/Legends|droid]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nThe two first wanted to establish the suspects stories, so Revan was assigned to interview each man. Handon Guld was pleasant towards Revan and told him that, as he couldn't stand speeders, he was out running on the plains. He said that he had heard a blaster shot, and ran over to see Nettic dead, and Rickard Lusoff emerging from the brush, where he immediately contacted the Enclave. Having no reason to be suspicious, Revan moved to interview Lusoff. Lusoff was much more confrontational than Guld, but answered Revan's questions nonetheless. Lusoff lied and said that he was out on the plains [[Hunting/Legends|hunting]] [[Iriaz]], when he saw a moving target, and lined up a shot. He said the [[Dina/Legends|sun]] had gotten into his [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] when he shot, and he wasn't able to see clearly, but shot anyway. When he ran out of the bushes, he saw Guld standing over Nettic's body. After some contemplation, Revan approached Bolook, claiming to know who was lying. Revan explained that since it was a very cloudy morning, the [[Star/Legends|sun]] could not have blinded Lusoff.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nAccording to Bolook, this information alone could not prove Lusoff guilty. Bolook decided it would be best to progress the case and start searching for a motive. The Jedi first wanted to establish a relationship between the suspects and the victim, so Revan was sent to question the suspects. When asked, Guld claimed that he barley knew Nettic beyond his name. Lusoff revealed his previous business with Nettic, although neither suspect mentioned their previous animosity with Nettic. However, Revan approached the information droid, and it was able to retrieve the archives of both the speeder rentals and the incident at the cantina in Garang.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nWhen Revan accused Lusoff of having a grudge against Nettic, the suspect was dismissive, simply replying with \"right.\" When Guld was confronted, however, he began to show animosity toward Nettic that he had hidden before. When asked about this, he broke and told Revan of the affair his wife had with Nettic, although he denied this as a motive.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nWith motives for both suspects, Bolook decided to focus the investigation on the blaster found at the scene, which had been sent to the Enclave. Revan spoke to the droid, which was able to determine that the blaster did not belong to Nettic. Although Lusoff claimed to have never seen the blaster before, Guld claimed that the blaster had been stolen from his house a week prior. This was proven untrue, as the information droid was unable to retrieve any related missing weapon report.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nHaving caught this lie, the two Jedi the turned their focus to the blood sample found on the weapon. However, the sample was contaminated, so the Enclave was only able to confirm that it was not Nettic's blood. After Bolook was brought this information, he wanted to inspect the suspects closer. They had noticed Lusoff's limp, but were unable to find any blood on his person. However, when the Jedi inspected Guld, they found blood from the blaster wound he had previously sustained. With this information, Bolook believed he was ready to come to an accurate conclusion.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n====The Conclusion====\n{{Quotetrans|A bold conclusion... one most people would not arrive at. But we are not most people, we are Jedi.|Bolook after hearing Revan's conclusion|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nBolook's initial conclusion was that Handon Guld committed the crime, and Rickard Lusoff had shot Guld by mistake while he was hunting. When he approached Revan with this conclusion, however, he disagreed, instead insisting that both suspects were guilty. Bolook was surprised, describing the conclusion as a bold one that most [[Detective/Legends|investigators]] would not arrive at. Revan explained that Guld's motive was his wife's affair, and Lusoff's was his belief that Nettic had been cheating him out of [[Currency/Legends|money]]. With this, Bolook delivered the correct timeline of events. Upon hearing this, Lusoff retorted, confirming the Jedi's suspicions. Under the authority of the Jedi, Bolook arrested Handon Guld for the murder of Calder Nettic,  Rickard Lusoff for aggravated assault and attempted murder. Bolook then escorted the two to the [[Jedi Enclave holding facilities|Enclave's holding facilities]], bidding Revan farewell, and promising to inform the Council of his assistance.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|I will use my wisdom and experience to offer you some guidance, but I will not solve the case for you. There is little benefit if you do not solve this problem yourself.|Bolook to Revan |Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nBolook was a [[Color/Legends|orange]]-skinned male Twi'lek with blue eyes. He wore his lekku around his neck, like many males of his species at the time.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nBolook had self-proclaimed wisdom and experience when it came to preforming investigations. When Revan agreed to assist with the case, Bolook was willing to help, but thought the experience would be more beneficial if Revan solved the case on his own. Bolook believed that Jedi were unlike most people, and did not gawk at Revan's bold conclusion. He was capable of understanding both [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] and [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]], but chose to speak in the latter during general conversation.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nBolook wore standard [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]], with a blue tunic, gray pants, gray [[Glove/Legends|gloves]], and dark blue [[Boot/Legends|boots]].

This cutscene starts the quest \"Murdered settler,\" in which most of Bolook's dialogue is spoken. However, the player has the option to refuse the quest in the initial cutscene, potentially insulting Bolook in the process.
