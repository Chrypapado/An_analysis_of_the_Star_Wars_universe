I need a purpose or something like that.|Canderous Ordo|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Canderous Ordo''', later known as '''Mandalore the Preserver''', was a [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] of [[Clan Ordo]] who fought in the [[Mandalorian Wars]] from [[3976 BBY]] to [[3960 BBY]]. While serving with the [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders]], he participated in several battles, earning significant glory and prestige with his bold tactics and leadership. Despite their many successes, the Mandalorians were decisively [[Battle of Malachor V|defeated]] by [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] forces under the command of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], and Ordo was among the survivors who were forced to give up their weapons in unconditional surrender. The Mandalorians scattered across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and Ordo began working as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]], eventually settling on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. Under the employ of local [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Davik Kang]], Ordo encountered his former enemy, Revan, although Ordo did not recognize him, as Revan was suffering from amnesia and now served as a Republic [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]].\n\nHaving grown bored of his life as an enforcer and eager to seek new challenges, Ordo decided to join the Republic soldier and left Taris, traveling with Revan and his companions to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] for a meeting with the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|local Jedi Council]]. Revan, who was [[Jedi training/Legends|retrained]] in the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] ways, was given the task of finding the location of the [[Star Forge]], an ancient [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] being used by [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]]. Ordo accompanied Revan on his mission, confident that he would find new challenges along the way. Contributing his experience as a warrior and [[Commander/Legends|commander]], Ordo helped Revan throughout his journey, content with having found a task worthy of his efforts. When Revan finally regained his memories and revealed his true identity, Ordo remained loyal and declared that he was proud to serve alongside such a formidable warrior. After [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Malak was defeated and the Star Forge [[Battle of Rakata Prime|destroyed]], Ordo, along with Revan and his companions, was honored by the Republic for his role in the conflict.\n\nAfter the conflict, Ordo reclaimed the [[Mandalore's Mask|mask]] of Mandalore with Revan's help and became the second [[Mandalore (title)|leader]] of the Mandalorians since their defeat in the war. Revan soon regained memories of a [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|threat]] in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] and left known [[Realspace/Legends|space]], instructing Ordo to restore the strength of the Mandalorians in preparation for his return. Ordo then began the arduous task of reuniting the scattered clans and rebuilding their military power. While reestablishing the Mandalorians, Ordo encountered another former opponent from the Mandalorian Wars, [[Meetra Surik]], also known as the Jedi Exile. After learning that Surik was being hunted by the [[Sith Triumvirate]], Ordo decided to aid her in gathering the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] who had survived the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[First Jedi Purge|assassination campaign]] in order to prevent the Sith from regaining their power. While traveling with Surik, Ordo continued recruiting Mandalorian clans and was instrumental in helping Surik [[Battle of Telos IV|defeat]] the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Nihilus]]. After Surik [[Battle of Malachor|eliminated]] the Sith Triumvirate, Ordo parted ways with her and awaited Revan's return from the Unknown Regions, keeping the Mandalorians ready for war.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I was one of the best youth warriors in clan Ordo in my time.|Canderous Ordo|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Young_Canderous_Ordo.jpg|thumb|left|A young Canderous Ordo]]\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Canderous Ordo was born to the [[Clan Ordo]] on the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ordo/Legends|Ordo]], and grew up during an age of significant breakthroughs in Mandalorian technology, when the [[Basilisk war droid/Legends|Basilisk war droids]] were being perfected.<ref>''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'': Ordo's Basilisk still lacked a closed cockpit, according to his tale.</ref> In those days, young warriors would prove themselves in real combat with unknown opponents on a number of worlds. Ordo underwent<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> his ''[[verd'goten]]'', the traditional Mandalorian rite of passage that marked the transition into adulthood at the age of thirteen,<ref>{{InsiderCite|86|The Mandalorians: People and Culture}}</ref> and received the privilege of [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]] his own Basilisk. Ordo remembered almost every battle he participated in, including his first, an eighty [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometer]] plunge through the [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]] of an opposing planet on the back of a Basilisk war [[Droid/Legends|droid]], dodging self-guided projectile and beam weapons, with barely any [[Armor/Legends|armor]] protecting him. During that battle, he gained considerable honor for his achievements, and became part of the most promising young warriors of his clan.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nFollowing the defeat of the [[Mandalorian Crusaders]] and their [[Exar Kun/Legends|Sith allies]] during the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]] in [[3996 BBY]], he was recruited by [[Mandalore the Ultimate]] into the [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Neo-Crusaders]] to serve as a battle tactician rather than a foot [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{InsiderCite|80|The History of the Mandalorians}}</ref> Sometime before 3963 BBY, Ordo and a party traversed the [[asteroid belt]]s of the [[Crispin system]] in order to hunt the [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] and [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] that used the frozen methane gas shells of the main belt for cover. Ordo targeted a small [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] with a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]], causing the outer layer of frozen gas to explode and destroy the hidden [[Starship/Legends|ships]]. However, the asteroid then started rotating and firing thermal projectiles that easily melted through Mandalorian armor, mysteriously fleeing before the Mandalorians could counter-attack. They tracked the vessel towards the galactic rim only to abandon their search when the ship went beyond the borders of the galaxy.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n===Mandalorian Wars===\n{{Quote|You had us outnumbered five to one. You had more ships, more troops, more supplies and the Jedi on your side. And we still made the Republic tremble before we fell!|Ordo, to Carth Onasi|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Basilisk.jpg|thumb|right|A Mandalorian and Basilisk War Droid]]\nBy the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Mandalorian Wars]], Ordo had attained the rank of [[Commander/Legends|commander]] and helped lead the Mandalorian's aggressive assault.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> For thirteen years, before they would invade the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in [[3963 BBY]],<ref name=\"KOTORCG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> the Mandalorians stockpiled resources from the worlds they conquered just outside Republic jurisdiction. Ordo participated in countless battles of the wars, one of the most notable being the [[Battle of Althir (first)|First Battle of Althir]], in which he defeated an [[Althir III|Althiri]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] ten times the size of his own and earned the command of an entire part of his clan. During the battle against the Althiri, Ordo's initial plan was to make a feint at flanks of the Althiri fleet in order to draw them out and weaken their formation. Ordo planned to have the bulk of his forces attack from the rear and defeat them. However, when the Althiri let their fleet split in two, leaving their center exposed, Ordo took advantage of the situation, breaking formation and eliminating the enemy commander, putting a quick end to the battle and avoiding further losses. However, in abandoning his position, Ordo left part of his own forces vulnerable and they suffered great losses. The sole survivor of that stand, another Mandalorian named [[Jagi]], believed Ordo to be a glory hunter, and was determined to have his revenge.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars, the Mandalorian forces were widely feared and hated for their indiscriminate and brutal tactics, which in many cases resulted in the complete destruction of some worlds. Though Ordo did not enjoy wiping out worlds for its own sake, it was his belief that the tactics the Republic used when the Mandalorians finally did enter their territory, like setting their bases inside major [[City/Legends|cities]], left Mandalore little choice but to raze whole worlds<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> such as [[Serroco]]<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /> in provocation.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Ordo expressed his disappointment with the weakness of the Republic forces and viewed their tactics as cowardly. Even when the Republic finally took action, the brutal efficiency of the Mandalorian advance overwhelmed Republic defenders and they continued cutting a swath into Republic territories. With the Republic on the brink of defeat, a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] named [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and his [[Revanchist|followers]] disobeyed the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council's]] orders for neutrality and took command of the Republic war effort. In Revan, Ordo finally found the worthy opponent and challenge he was seeking. Ordo was greatly impressed by Revan's tactics, many of which were similar to those of the Mandalorians in their efficiency. With Revan's leadership, the war soon began to shift in favor of the Republic. Revan's ferocity, tenacity, and subtlety earned him a great deal of respect from Ordo. Despite the continual losses the Mandalorians faced against Revan's forces, Ordo was pleased with having found a conflict worthy of his skills, even as the Mandalorians were pushed to the edge of defeat.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nAt the close of the conflict, Ordo was among two fleets that filled the [[Realspace/Legends|space]] around [[Malachor V]], where the Mandalorians had committed all of their forces in a last [[Battle of Malachor V|attempt]] at defeating the Republic. Ordo and the rest of the Mandalorians were unaware that Revan had intentionally lured them to Malachor V as part of a trap. With the fleets engaged, a [[Meetra Surik|Jedi General]] in command of the Republic fleet activated the [[Mass Shadow Generator/Legends|Mass Shadow Generator]], a [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] which destroyed a large portion of both fleets and devastated the surface of the planet.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /> Ordo was among those outside the scope of the superweapon who were able to escape the [[Mass shadow/Legends|mass shadows]] and survive the battle. In [[3960 BBY]], the Mandalorians surrendered unconditionally, with Mandalore having been personally slain by Revan while the others were stripped of their weapons and armor and sent into exile in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]]. At some point before the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Ordo married [[Veela Ordo|Veela]], a fellow Mandalorian, but he left his wife behind when he left Clan Ordo and went into exile.<ref name=\"Revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''</ref> With nothing to call his own but the honor of having fought in the war, Ordo became a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] and wandered the galaxy looking for further challenges. He eventually ended up on the planet [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], enforcing for local [[Exchange]] boss [[Davik Kang]], but soon found his new job ill-suited him, offering no challenges worthy of his skill.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n===Jedi Civil War===\n{{Quote|I'm someone you don't want to get on the bad side of.|Ordo, to Revan during their initial meeting in the Taris Lower City|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:CanderousOrdoInTheLowerCity.jpg|thumb|left|Ordo in the Lower City of Taris]]\n[[3959 BBY|One year]] after the end of the Mandalorian Wars,<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" /> while Revan took up the mantle of [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and started his own [[Jedi Civil War|crusade]] against the Republic, Ordo became the most famous Mandalorian mercenary in the [[Taris sector]].<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> By [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" /> he had been fighting across the galaxy for forty [[Galactic Standard Calendar|standard years]]. Ordo had become increasingly dissatisfied with his life as Kang's enforcer, a career which he viewed as monotonous and without honor. Acting as little more than hired muscle, Ordo typically carried out simple tasks requiring little of his talent, such as threatening uncooperative clients who owed Kang money or salvaging useful equipment from Taris' [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]]. Unhappy with the mundane nature of his current life, Ordo longed to find new challenges and opportunities which would allow him to use his skills.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nBy this point, Revan's [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] had achieved countless victories against an already battered Republic. Revan himself had since been betrayed by his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] [[Darth Malak]] and [[Capture of Darth Revan|captured]] by the Jedi. The Jedi Council then re-wrote Revan's memories and programmed him to serve the Republic as a soldier.<ref>[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']] {{C|''The Redemption of Revan''}}</ref> The war had even spread as far as Taris, and the Republic [[Warship/Legends|warship]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'' was [[Attack on the Endar Spire|destroyed]] by Malak's forces over the planet. Ordo was not aware of the fact that the amnesiac Revan had been aboard the ''Spire'' and was one of the few survivors along with [[Carth Onasi]], a Republic [[Captain/Legends|captain]] who had served in the Mandalorian Wars. Ordo actually encountered Revan while carrying out a job collecting payment from the local gang known as the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]] for Kang in the [[Lower City]], although he did not recognize his former opponent. Ordo was soon sent on a salvage mission by Kang into the Undercity, where most of the Republic [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]] had landed. Ordo was reluctant to lead Kang's inexperienced men into the Undercity, and was frustrated upon finding that the pods had already been stripped of anything valuable by local gangs. While continuing the search, his group was ambushed by [[rakghoul]]s, deformed [[mutant]]s native to the Undercity. While fighting off the rakghouls, Ordo encountered Revan once again, who was also attempting to reach the escape pods in search of [[Bastila Shan]], the Jedi Knight who had been in command of the ''Endar Spire''. With Revan's aid, Ordo's group successfully fought off the rakghouls, although Kang's men sustained significant casualties. Ordo informed Revan of his findings at the pods before leaving and advising Revan to do the same.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nAfter the botched salvage mission, Ordo decided he was done working for Kang and began preparations to leave the planet by stealing Kang's personal starship, the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''. He soon found leaving Taris would be more difficult than he originally thought, as Malak was [[Blockade/Legends|blockading]] the planet while he conducted his own search for Republic survivors. The only way to pass the blockade was with the correct launch codes, which could only be obtained from the local [[Tarisian military base|Sith garrison]]. Ordo purchased the [[utility droid]] [[T3-M4]], which was capable of bypassing the garrison's security, but knew he was too well-known to personally storm the base and left the droid at the [[Droids by Janice|shop]] until he could come up with a better plan. He soon found his solution when he heard that Revan had successfully [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|rescued]] Shan from captivity, wiping out the Black Vulkars in the process. Impressed by his recklessness and skill in battle, Ordo chose Revan for his plan to bypass the blockade and escape Taris. Ordo met with Revan in [[Javyar's Cantina]] in the Lower City and offered him a deal; he asked that Revan retrieve the launch codes and in exchange, he would get them into Kang's compound in order to steal the ''Hawk''. Revan agreed, and Ordo gave him instructions to obtain T3-M4, who could get him past base security.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n====Working with Revan====\n{{Quote|Whatever you are fighting, it will be worthy of my skill.|Ordo, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Jagidead.jpg|thumb|200px|Ordo and Jagi shortly after the latter committed suicide]]\nOrdo then waited for Revan to obtain the launch codes, and soon heard about his attack on the Sith garrison. Revan and Shan soon returned with the codes and Ordo took them to meet Kang. Ordo vouched for Revan, stating that he was a potential employee for Kang's operations, which gave the group free reign in the Exchange base. Ordo led the group to Kang's personal [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] just as an impatient [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Malak ordered Taris [[Destruction of Taris|bombarded]]. Unfortunately for Ordo, Kang and another one of his enforcers, the bounty hunter [[Calo Nord]], were also hoping to make their escape, and Revan and Ordo were forced to deal with them first. After Kang was killed, Nord attempted to set off a thermal detonator, but was crushed by debris as the bombardment continued. Ordo narrowly escaped with the rest of Revan's companions aboard the ''Hawk'' as the city was leveled around them. Having seen more combat and excitement than he had in years, Ordo resolved to continue traveling with Revan and contribute his experience to the group. The group decided to meet with the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] next, as Shan needed to report on recent events, as well as her concern over how Revan's memories and Force-sensitivity seemed to be gradually returning. The Council decided to [[Jedi training/Legends|re-train]] Revan in the Jedi ways and assigned him the task of finding the [[Star Forge]], a superweapon being used by Darth Malak against the Republic. During the journey, Ordo aided Revan with his tactical insight and experience in combat, although he often disapproved of Revan's more compassionate actions.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nWhile searching for the Star Forge, Ordo often regaled Revan with tales of his past battles, and would later explain that he hoped to continue finding battles worthy of his skill while traveling with Revan, something he could not do under Kang or any other employer. Ordo also expressed his opinion of the Republic's weakness and believed that the galaxy would have been in much better hands under Mandalorian rule. Ordo also kept a supply of [[Stimulant/Legends|stimulants]] and offered them for use by the rest of the crew, although he personally disdained using such devices. As part of their goal of locating the Star Forge, Ordo traveled with Revan in search of a series of [[Star Map]]s, each of which held a partial set of coordinates to the Star Forge. This journey took them to the worlds of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]] and [[Korriban]], and the crew fought against near-constant interference by Malak's forces.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nEventually, Ordo was inadvertently reunited with his former comrade Jagi, now a Hutt-employed mercenary. Still bearing a grudge against Ordo for what he saw as abandoning his men during the Battle of Althir, he challenged Ordo to a duel in the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]] of Tatooine to answer for his choices. Ordo would not stand the insult and was determined to kill him so that his honor would remain unblemished. Revan insisted on accompanying Ordo to the duel site, and managed to convince Jagi that Ordo had saved many more lives with his choice despite the death of Jagi's unit. Shamed by his actions and having lost his purpose in life, Jagi committed [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]], greatly shocking and traumatizing the normally stoic Ordo. Despite this, Revan's actions had earned Ordo's loyalty, and Ordo expressed his gratitude for Revan's help.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /><ref name=\"CSWEJagi\">{{CSWECite|II|133-134|Jagi}}</ref>\n\nAt one point during their travels, the ''Ebon Hawk'' was ambushed by [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]] of the Sith Navy and taken aboard the [[Interdictor-class cruiser|''Interdictor'' ship]] [[Leviathan (Interdictor-class cruiser)|''Leviathan'']]. Revan, Onasi and Shan were split from the rest of the crew and detained separately for interrogation, but the three arranged for another crew member to release them. After being set free and releasing the rest of the crew from their cells, Revan, Onasi and Shan went to the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] to deal with Admiral Karath and the [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]] which originally captured them while the others followed Ordo to secure the ''Ebon Hawk''. Fighting his way to the docking bays, Ordo's leadership got the rest of the crew to the ship with no casualties, and they escaped as soon as Revan and Onasi returned.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nAfter escaping the ''Leviathan''{{'s}} weapons range, Revan explained to the crew that he had encountered Darth Malak when heading back to meet with the crew, and that Shan had been captured while giving Revan and Onasi a chance to escape. Revan then confessed that Malak had informed him of his true identity as a former Jedi Knight and [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]]. Ordo was pleasantly surprised, and his loyalty remained unchanged due to his high level of respect for Revan's prowess in the Mandalorian Wars. Proud to serve with such a powerful warrior, Ordo expressed his willingness to follow Revan anywhere he commanded. Ordo continued traveling with Revan, their search soon leading to the planet of<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> [[Lehon|Rakata Prime]]<ref name=\"NEC: TP-RE\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' {{C|''The Pre-Republic Era''}}</ref> in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]], where the Star Forge was located. Revan and his team boarded the Star Forge as the Republic fleet launched an [[Battle of Rakata Prime|assault]] on the Rakatan superweapon. Fighting his way through heavy Sith resistance, Revan succeeded in rescuing Shan and slaying Malak in single combat.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n===Mandalore the Preserver===\n{{Quote|I brought them here, gave them a purpose. The galaxy will be ours again, I promise you. That is the future.|Mandalore, to Kreia on the future of the Mandalorians|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n[[File:Dxun_mist.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ordo reestablished the Mandalorians deep in the jungles of Dxun.]]\nIn the peace after Malak's defeat, more of Revan's lost memories started to resurface, and he began to remember a [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|threat]] he had encountered in the Unknown Regions. Realizing that the galaxy in its current state stood no chance at repelling an invasion, Revan began preparations to strengthen the Republic before leaving to confront the threat himself. Revan decided to call upon Ordo's aid once more in order to gather the scattered Mandalorian clans and restore the strength of the Mandalorians to support the Republic. While Ordo did not think the clans as they were could reunite any time soon, he agreed to seek out Clan Ordo with Revan in order to help them [[Search for Mandalore's Mask|find]] [[Mandalore's Mask|Mandalore's mask]], which would convince the Mandalorians of the legitimacy of Ordo's authority. Though Ordo suggested that they round up their old crew for one last adventure, Revan decided to only bring T3, for everyone had their own commitments, especially with Bastila being pregnant.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /><ref name=\"Revan\" />\n\nRevan and Ordo traveled to the Outer Rim ice world of [[Rekkiad]], where the Mandalorian clans had already come together in search of Mandalore's Mask. Due to the animosity some Mandalorians still had towards Revan, Ordo advised he travel under an alias and refrain from using his lightsaber. Upon tracking down his clan, Ordo received a warm welcome from his clan mates, although his wife Veela still bore some resentment for what she perceived as his abandonment of her and the clan after the war. With the information from Revan's recently returned memories, Clan Ordo was able to pinpoint the location where Mandalore's Mask was hidden, and Ordo slowly began to reconcile with his wife. However, Revan was forced to use his lightsaber during a [[Skirmish on Rekkiad|battle]] with a rival Mandalorian clan and Veela was able to discover his true identity.<ref name=\"Revan\" />\n\nWhen the clan finally succeeded in recovering Mandalore's Mask, Veela and a few other members of the clan insisted on killing Revan for what he did to the Mandalorian people and begged Ordo to side with them. Ordo refused to turn on his friend and was forced to kill his wife in the ensuing [[Skirmish in Dramath the Second's tomb|firefight]]. Before parting ways with Ordo to continue his search for the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], Revan revealed to him the truth about Mandalore the Ultimate and his Sith allies; the Sith had been behind the Mandalorian Wars all along, and had tricked the Mandalorians into invading as a test of the Republic's strength to help them plan for their own eventual invasion. And if the Sith were to return, they would either destroy the Mandalorians or manipulate them into aiding their long blood feud with the Jedi. With this revelation, Ordo then claimed the mask and took on the title of Mandalore the Preserver, promising to reunite the Mandalorian clans and stand with the Republic against the Sith should they return.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /><ref name=\"Revan\" />\n\nAs Ordo journeyed to reunite the Mandalorian clans, he met an ailing [[Taung/Legends|Taung]] who declared himself to be the [[Unidentified Mandalore|true Mandalore]], and claimed that the man known as \"Mandalore the Ultimate\" was a pretender to the Mandalore title. Before dying, this nameless Mandalorian consigned his [[Mandalore's armor|armor]] to Ordo, asking him to preserve their traditions. Ordo took the armor for himself, and incorporated the mask given to him by Revan. After absorbing the Taung's clan into Clan Ordo, he returned to the [[Mandalorian Outpost (Dxun)|Mandalorian outpost]] of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], one of the four [[Moon/Legends|moons]] of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] to begin reuniting the Mandalorians.<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" /> Only a select few knew the identity of the new Mandalore, as he never took off his armor and helmet in the presence of others, not even while [[Sleep/Legends|sleeping]], according to rumors. Making Dxun his base of operations, the new Mandalore continued the arduous task of restoring the clans to prominence. He found his recruits in all walks of life, serving as [[Technician/Legends|mechanics]], [[Scout/Legends|scouts]] and mercenaries for clients across the galaxy. Inspired by Ordo's vision of the return of Mandalorian influence, countless clans banded together and joined him on Dxun.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /><ref name=\"Revan\" />\n\n[[File:Canderousmandalorefull.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Ordo as Mandalore the Preserver.]]\n[[3951 BBY|Approximately three years]] after Revan gave Ordo the task of reuniting the Mandalorians, Ordo encountered another figure from his past in the Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile.<ref name=\"Revan\" /> Surik was one of the many Jedi who had joined Revan against the wishes of the Council and led the Republic fleet during the final battle at Malachor V. In the years since Revan's departure, the Republic had continued to weaken in the aftermath of fighting costly wars against the Mandalorians and the Sith. The Sith, led by a new [[Sith Triumvirate|triumvirate]] of Sith Lords took the opportunity to quietly regain their power, eventually culminating in a devastating [[Conclave at Katarr|strike]] which [[First Jedi Purge|eliminated]] most of the Jedi remaining in the galaxy. Surik was one of the few survivors and was in the process of tracking down the [[Lost Jedi|Jedi Masters]] who had gone into hiding since the purge.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nHer search for Jedi Master [[Kavar]] led to Onderon, which was currently under blockade by military forces loyal to Onderonian [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]], who was attempting to assert Onderon's independence from the Republic by cutting off all contact. Surik's vessel soon came under attack by Vaklu's forces, and damage inflicted during the battle forced her to land on Dxun. The sensors of the Mandalorian camp picked up the Surik's arrival, and Ordo was curious as to why she was in possession of the ''Ebon Hawk'', a vessel that had last been seen with Revan. Determined to find some answers, Ordo had Mandalorian sentries meet Surik and her companions outside the camp and lead them to him. Ordo recognized Surik and decided to observe her in order to learn her intentions. When Surik requested transport to Onderon, Ordo agreed to take her on the next supply run under the condition she proved she was not going to be a liability. By accomplishing various tasks for the Mandalorians in the camp Surik gained quite a reputation among his warriors, and Ordo decided she had proved her worth.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\n====Travels with Meetra Surik====\n{{Quote|I am Mandalore, leader of the Mandalorians.

During his preparations, Ordo was confronted by one of Surik's companions, the mysterious Jedi Master [[Kreia]]. She revealed that she had also been Revan's teacher long before and now asked for his loyalty to Surik. Ordo was initially angered by Kreia's lack of respect toward his people, whom she dismissed as broken and scattered, but she also expressed her esteem for the loyalty he had shown to Revan and promised to answer why her old apprentice did not take Ordo with him when he left for the Unknown Regions, as long as Ordo kept Surik safe. Ordo was perplexed that the old woman knew about him and Revan, and resolved to keep a close [[Eye/Legends|eye]] on her in the future.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nUnexpectedly, [[Sith assassin/Legends|Sith assassins]] [[Skirmish on Dxun|assaulted]] the Mandalorian camp before they could launch, having tracked Surik to Dxun. With the aid of Surik and her companions, Ordo repulsed the initial intrusion before accelerating the shuttle launch and leaving the remaining Sith for his Mandalorian forces to deal with. After arriving in the city of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], he directed Surik to an acquaintance of his, [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Dhagon Ghent]], whom he thought was in contact with Kavar. Though Ghent was being held by local authorities as a suspect for the murder of Captain [[Sullio]], an officer of the [[Onderonian military]], Ordo and Surik were able to prove his innocence after investigating the individuals and evidence around the crime scene. In gratitude, Ghent arranged for a message to be smuggled to the [[Iziz Royal Palace]], where Kavar was hiding under the protection of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]].<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nWhile traveling in Iziz, Ordo and Surik found that much of the populace was divided between supporting the policies of Queen Talia and those of General Vaklu. As Talia's cousin, Vaklu held ambitions of gaining control of Onderon and was covertly undermining Talia's rule. While Surik disagreed with Vaklu's questionable morality, Ordo was impressed with his tactics and ambition, and voiced his opinion that Surik would be better off supporting the general. They additionally encountered another veteran of the Mandalorian Wars, Captain [[Bostuco]], who had fought the Mandalorians during their occupation of Onderon. Ordo took offense at Bostuco's claim that the Onderonian military forced the Mandalorians off-world, and insisted that the Jedi were responsible, while also stating that Mandalorians never gave ground to any Onderonian soldiers. Eventually Kavar responded to the message and agreed to meet with Surik. Ordo was delighted to meet the [[Jedi Guardian]], whose tactical and combat prowess was renowned among the Mandalorians. They assumed Kavar would have led the Republic forces in the Mandalorian Wars, although Kavar ended up opposing Jedi intervention in the conflict. General Vaklu's forces soon interrupted their meeting, forcing Ordo and Surik to return to Dxun. Before departing, Kavar promised to contact Surik again. Upon their return to Dxun, Ordo decided to join Surik against the Sith in order to prevent their influence from spreading, as well as to search for more Mandalorian clans. After joining Surik's group of followers, Ordo journeyed to the worlds such as [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], Dantooine, and Korriban as part of Surik's continuing search for the Jedi Masters.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nAfter some time, Kavar sent Surik another message, requesting her aid against General Vaklu, who had since launched a military coup to seize power from Queen Talia. While Ordo respected Vaklu's ambition, he agreed to support Queen Talia once he learned that Vaklu's forces were receiving aid from the Sith. Returning to Dxun once again, Ordo was informed that the Mandalorian camp's sensors had picked up a large amount of Sith activity on a different part of Dxun. Surik split her crew into two groups, with some of her companions leading Mandalorian forces to destroy the Sith presence on Dxun while Surik herself planned to return to Onderon to help Kavar and Talia. On Dxun, Surik's group and the Mandalorian forces found that the Sith were massing around the ancient [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|tomb]] of [[Freedon Nadd|a Sith Lord]], and were using the area's [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] energies to bolster their power. The Mandalorians and Surik's companions were successful in defeating the Sith forces in the tomb, subduing many high ranking Sith in the process. Meanwhile, Surik made use of a Basilisk War Droid provided by Ordo to travel back to Onderon. The Basilisk's presence had a significant effect on the morale of Vaklu's troops and helped Surik in her effort to break through the [[Onderon Civil War|siege]] of the Royal Palace. With Kavar's help, Surik was ultimately successful in defeating Vaklu and rescuing Talia.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nLater on, Ordo distinguished himself in the [[Battle of Telos IV]], leading his forces alongside Carth Onasi, now an admiral of the Republic Navy, in engaging the Sith fleet led by the Sith Lord [[Darth Nihilus]]. Believing that the Republic's forces were insufficient to drive off the Sith assault, he rallied his Mandalorians to bolster the defense of [[Telos IV]], confident that his soldiers were superior to any force the Republic had available. He boarded Nihilus' [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Ravager (Centurion-class)|''Ravager'']], with his [[Trooper/Legends|troops]] and met the Sith Lord in battle together with Surik<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /> and Nihilus' former [[Shadow Hand]]<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" /> [[Visas Marr]]. With their coordinated effort, the Sith Lord was slain, depriving the remaining Sith forces of leadership. Ordo also arranged for several [[Proton bomb/Legends|proton bombs]] to be set on the ship, which obliterated the ''Ravager'', enabling Onasi's forces to eliminate the surviving vessels. After Nihilus' defeat, Ordo's suspicions towards Kreia were proven to be validated as she revealed her true identity as the Sith Lord Darth Traya. Ordo joined Surik in pursuing her to Malachor V, although he was reluctant to return to the site of the Mandalorian's greatest defeat. Surik was successful in defeating Darth Traya and Ordo parted ways with her soon after, continuing his task of restoring Mandalorian power.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Many men will volunteer to die, but few will be patient in the face of pain.|Attributed to Canderous Ordo|The Essential Guide to Warfare}}\n[[File:ARC_Captain_Ordo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|ARC captain Ordo, clone Null-11]]\nAccording to predictions made by Kreia, Ordo's future would be one still full of battle.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /> As a result of these battles and Revan's command to reunite the Mandalorians, Ordo and the Mandalorians would eventually reclaim some of their former power and reestablish the Mandalorians as a significant faction in galactic affairs. Ordo's success in reuniting the scattered clans was instrumental in bringing the Mandalorians back to prominence after their defeat in the Mandalorian Wars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nApproximately [[3653 BBY|three hundred years]] after Ordo traveled with Revan and Surik, the Mandalorians became divided over which faction to support in the [[Great Galactic War]]. While most Mandalorians followed an Imperial puppet [[Mandalore the Lesser|Mandalore]] and supported the resurgent Sith Empire, a faction of Mandalorians led by [[Jicoln Cadera]] stayed true to Ordo's legacy and believed the Mandalorians should support the Republic. Cadera and his faction were eventually destroyed by [[Mandalore the Vindicated]], who had slain the puppet Mandalore the Lesser. True to Darth Traya's predictions, Ordo eventually fell in battle, and his skull somehow wound up in the possession of the Sith Empire sometime prior to 3641 BBY. Displayed before a green-gold&ndash;colored banner that bore the [[Mythosaur/Legends|mythosaur]] skull sigil, a [[Voidhound|smuggler]] eventually came across the skull on an [[King's Ransom (treasury ship)|Imperial ship]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], and noted signs of a large piercing wound that presumably was the cause of death.<ref name=\"Bio\" /><ref name=\"TOR\">{{TORcite|type=class|Smuggler|Heist of the Millennium|Nar Shaddaa}}</ref> A [[holostatue]] of Ordo was erected in the [[Leisure Garden]] section of the [[Axial Park]] in the [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], along with the statues of Revan and his other companions in memory of their deeds.<ref name=\"Statues\">{{TORcite|type=faction|Republic|Bonus: Restoring the Statues|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[Clone trooper/Legends|Clone trooper]] [[Ordo Skirata|Null-11]], an [[Advanced Recon Commando/Legends|Advanced Recon Commando]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], was named \"Ordo\" by [[Kal Skirata]] in honor of the legendary Mandalorian warrior.<ref name=\"Republic Commando series\">''[[Republic Commando: Triple Zero]]''</ref> Around the rise of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], [[MandalMotors/Legends|MandalMotors]] ground military branch created a heavy assault vehicle comparable to an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]] [[Walker/Legends|walker]], dedicating it the [[Canderous-class assault tank|''Canderous''-class assault tank]]<ref name=\"FOC\">''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]''</ref> in honor of Ordo.<ref name=\"RECG\">''[[Rebellion Era Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|My name's Canderous of the Mandalorian clan Ordo. I've been fighting across the galaxy for forty of your years. For my people it's the honor and glory of battle that rules us. It's through combat that we prove our worth, gain renown and make our fortunes.|Canderous Ordo, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Canderous_KOTORCG.jpg|left|thumb|Canderous Ordo]]\nAs befitting of the ideals the Mandalorians sought to uphold, Ordo lived for battle. In addition, Ordo lived his life seeking honor, which he believed could only be achieved through conflict with a worthy foe. In his youth, Ordo possessed dark hair, which later began to turn gray from the stresses of a life devoted to combat. He was always impressed by a show of force, and was an advocate of combat before diplomacy. Ordo respected Revan for his aggressive tactics during the Mandalorian Wars, and felt no regret or anger about being bested by such a proficient foe. His driving personality traits were best described as ambition, discipline, aggression, and loyalty. Ordo tended to speak in a gruff, serious manner, and was typically very blunt in expressing his opinions and thoughts. When prompted by others, Ordo was often willing to share stories of his role in various conflicts, taking pride in his related tales of his success. Whenever he encountered war veterans, he would usually ask them about the battles they fought in or what their opinion was of the Mandalorians, hoping to hear accounts from his former opponents. He often displayed disappointment when he found that many on the Republic's side did not share his fondness of the past. As Ordo found that most did not see the past conflict the same way, he became disillusioned after the defeat of the Mandalorians. He once expressed this feeling to Revan, explaining that he felt he was no longer the Mandalorian he once was.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nWhile Revan and Ordo gradually became friends, Ordo maintained a professional stance and always referred to Revan as his employer. Although he originally only intended to ally himself with Revan as a means of escaping Taris, his respect for the former Sith Lord continued to grow as he accompanied him, even before he learned of his true identity. Despite the fact that he had become distant from his people and culture while serving Davik, Ordo still held true to the ways of the Mandalorians and chose to remain amongst the crew of the ''Ebon Hawk'' under the belief that their adventures would bring much needed glory and honor to his heavily diminished pride. Even though he was quite distant to the rest of Revan's companions, Ordo slowly came to respect the programmed persona of Revan. Despite providing Revan with stimulants when asked, Ordo personally felt that a true warrior should develop their own strength and did not require such aid. When it was discovered that the amnesiac Jedi was indeed Darth Revan himself, Ordo was, unlike the rest of his companions, greatly pleased. Ordo willingly pledged his loyalty and allegiance to the former Sith Lord, firmly believing that his service to Revan would bring him all the battles and glory he sought.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic \" />\n\nAfter taking up the mantle of Mandalore the Preserver, Ordo led the reunited clans with strict discipline, reflecting his views of the Mandalorian ideals. In choosing Dxun as his base of operations, Ordo forced the Mandalorians to deal with the violent jungle on a daily basis in addition to the typical brutal training. His troops respected him implicitly, often displaying a willingness to die rather than face public shame at their failure, and obeyed his orders without question. He maintained his strong focus on honor as a leader, and would not aid Surik until she proved her worth among the Mandalorians. As a leader, Ordo always kept a calm and collected demeanor, even when leading troops into battle. When events did not unfold according to plan, his experience enabled him to adapt to new circumstances. One of Ordo's most prominent traits was his loyalty, both to the Mandalorian way as well as to those he followed. Years after Revan's departure, Ordo's loyalty remained undiminished, and even when he did not agree with Surik's decisions, he never did more than briefly express his opinion before following her lead.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:CanderousCombat.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Ordo firing his personal repeater]]\n{{Quote|I've fought countless battles&ndash;ones most didn't walk away from.

He possessed great physical and mental stamina as well as strategic and tactical skills, which he demonstrated on numerous occasions both in war and as a mercenary. During the Jedi Civil War, his [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic implants]] were limited but allowed him to regenerate minor wounds and recover far more quickly than normal. His regenerative ability also allowed him to briefly enter a catatonic state in order to heal more severe injuries.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nAs of [[3951 BBY]],<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" /> however, his implants included selective ability boosters that Ordo could activate as needed without fear of damage, giving him temporary increases in areas such as strength and stamina.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" /> His weapon of choice from the latter part of the Mandalorian Wars onward was a prototype [[Ordo's Repeating Blaster|heavy repeater]] that never saw general production.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> However, when he became leader of the Mandalorians, he was known to wield a common repeating [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]]. Also, during that time, he donned [[Mandalorian battle armor]] which he kept in exceptional condition. The years of combat began to take their toll on Ordo in his later years, and he revealed to Surik that his weakening body had become increasingly dependent on his armor and implants to function. Despite his aging, Ordo never shied away from combat, and continued to lead his troops from the frontline.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Canderousart.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Early concept art of Ordo]]\nCanderous Ordo is a playable character in the [[Personal computer|computer]] and [[video game]]s ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' and its sequel ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', although he is credited as \"Mandalore\" in the latter.

While traveling with Surik, Ordo can meet other Mandalorian clans on Dantooine and [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. With the aid of Surik, Ordo can convince the two groups to join his forces on Dxun. However, not all the Mandalorians immediately submit to Ordo's authority, and [[Esok]], the leader of a group of Mandalorian mercenaries stationed on Dantooine, will attempt to usurp the title of Mandalore and engage the player in combat. Since the player has free choice in choosing the order in which they visit each planet, Ordo's presence during these encounters is uncertain and therefore of ambiguous canon status.<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n\nIn the non-canonical dark side path of ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'', Ordo is the only non-droid party member who joins the reborn Darth Revan without question, save for Bastila Shan, who has already fallen to the dark side. Should Revan fail to persuade Jagi during the duel in the Dune, Ordo will be forced to kill Jagi and his henchman personally. In addition, a dark-sided Surik in ''The Sith Lords'' impresses Ordo, causing him to trust her more and to eventually discuss his journeys with Revan more freely. In the ''Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide'' supplement to the [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]], Ordo's title as Mandalore is revealed as Mandalore the Preserver. The [[Wikipedia:Real-time strategy|Real-time strategy]] game ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]'' contains a reference to Ordo in the form of the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium's]] ''Canderous''-class assault tank.<ref name=\"FOC\" /> The assault tank also appears in the [[Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi|''Fate of the Jedi'']] novel series.<ref name=\"Allies\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]''</ref>\n\n\"Mandalore the Preserver\"'s armor was used as the basis for the armor of all the Mandalorian miniatures (except [[Mandalore the Indomitable]]) in the ''[[Star Wars Miniatures]]'' expansion, [[Bounty Hunters (Star Wars Miniatures)|''Bounty Hunters'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Canderous Ordo}}\n{{Wq}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''\n*[[The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Revan'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*[[Cartel Market|''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' Cartel Market]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan]]'' {{Codex}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught]]'' {{Codex}}\n*''[[Republic Commando: Triple Zero]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Imperial Commando: 501st]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031126thyferra4|text=Thyferra: Bacta Basics Part 4|int=Thyferra: Bacta Basics|archivedate=20031203000609}}\n*''[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|80|The History of the Mandalorians}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' {{C|''The Sith Civil War''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*{{SWArchive|url=eu/lit/novel/news20060913.html|text=Updated ''Mando'a'' Glossary and Guide|archivedate=20080526030610}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/other/rpg/news20080305.html|text=Minatures Preview: Canderous Ordo|archivedate=20080309182631}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force (Star Wars Miniatures)]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Rebellion Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[Galaxy of Intrigue]]''\n*{{Holonet|old=true|biographies|mandalore|Mandalore}}\n*{{InsiderCite|127|Revan Returns}}\n*{{DB|character|canderousordo|Ordo, Canderous|archivedate=20100329221114}}\n*{{DB|character|davikkang|Davik Kang|Kang, Davik|archivedate=20100414090314}}\n*{{DB|droid|t3m4|T3-M4|archivedate=20100616152713}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}\n*{{InsiderCite|150|Insider Looks Back}}\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore]]<ref name=\"KotOR II\" />\n|years=[[3954 BBY]]&mdash;<ref name=\"Revan\" />\n|before=[[Unidentified Mandalore]]<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" />\n|before-years=&mdash;[[3956 BBY]]<ref name=\"KOTORCG\" />\n|after=Eventually [[Mandalore the Lesser]]<ref name=\"Time3\">{{TORweb|url=holonet/galactic-history|text=Timeline 3: The Return of the Mandalorians|int=Timeline 3: The Return of the Mandalorians}}</ref>\n|after-years=[[3667 BBY]]&mdash;<ref name=\"Time3\" />}}\n{{End_box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{K1char}}{{K2char}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Canderous Ordo\n|de=Canderous Ordo#legends\n|el=\u039a\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u038c\u03c1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\n|es=Canderous Ordo\n|fr=Canderous Ordo\n|it=Canderous Ordo\n|ja=\u30ab\u30f3\u30c7\u30e9\u30b9\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30c9\n|nl=Canderous Ordo\n|pl=Canderous Ordo\n|pt=Legends:Canderous Ordo\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441 \u041e\u0440\u0434\u043e\n|deFA=1\n|esFA=1\n|plFA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ordo, Canderous}}\n[[Category:Admirals and generals]]\n[[Category:Clan Ordo]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lost Jedi (Meetra Surik)]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mand'alor]]\n[[Category:Mandalorian Crusaders]]\n[[Category:Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
