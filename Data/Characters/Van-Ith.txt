We will talk to Van-Ith, the ruler of Vanqor.|Typha-Dor ruler Binalu, to the [[Mission to Typha-Dor|Jedi envoys sent]] at the behest of the Galactic Senate.|Jedi Quest: The Moment of Truth}}\n'''Van-Ith''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served as the ruler of [[Vanqor]] in the years leading up to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]], Van-Ith began an expansionist enterprise of invasion and conquest that led the Vanqor to controlling the entire [[Uziel system]], except for the planet [[Typha-Dor]]. The Vanqors dominated Uziel airspace.\n\nDespite his planet's lack of resources, Van-Ith was able to create a massive amount of power for Vanqor through cunning use of the few resources the planet did have augmented by a skillful conquest of worlds rich with resources\u2014an aggressive enterprise that lay in stark contrast to planets like Typha-Dor and others that had large amounts of resources, but ostensibly no drive to succeed. Under Van-Ith's rule, Vanqor was thus able, through its expansionist policies, to creating booming industries for itself and to achieve a measure of wealth.\n\nIn [[25 BBY/Legends|25 BBY]], Van-Ith ordered an invasion of the neighboring [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of Typha-Dor. Employing an undercover agent by the name of [[Mezdec]], to infiltrate Typha-Dor's [[TY44]] [[Satellite/Legends|satellite]] surveillance outpost, Van-Ith moved forward with Vanqor's invasion once Mezdec had delivered a disk containing false invasion plans to Typha-Dor's rulers and military leadership. Van-Ith's plans were foiled, however, by the Jedi, who were [[Mission to Typha-Dor|able to deliver]] a disk with Vanqor's true invasion plans to Typha-Dor's rulers. This enabled the threatened planet to launch a preemptive countermeasure to trap Van-Ith's fleet in a [[Satellite/Legends|satellite]]-[[Moon/Legends|moon]] corridor through which the Vanqor fleet made its approach, and to force a truce.\n\nVan-Ith worked with Typha-Dor's \"twin rulers\" [[Binalu]] and [[Talus (Human)|Talus]], and also [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], [[Clee Rhara]], [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]], and the other [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] sent, to negotiate a ceasefire and an enduring peace between the two worlds.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The Moment of Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monarchs]]\n[[Category:Vanqor residents]]"}}}]}}}}
