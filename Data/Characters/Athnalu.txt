Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Athnalu came under the impression that a spell had been placed on her by members of the [[Sayormi]], a mysterious [[Species/Legends|species]] that lived in the nearby [[Dead Forest (Kashyyyk)|Dead Forest]]. Mentally unstable and in constant physical pain, Athnalu hired a passing [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to find several objects that she thought would lift the curse. The spacer located five Sayormi [[Voodoo/Legends|voodoo dolls]], [[shadevale]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], [[mouf]] hair, and a [[Mysess blossom]] for Athnalu. Believing herself cured of the curse, Athnalu thanked the spacer and gave the traveler 2,200 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and a [[ceremonial chair]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|Like threaded knives, I can feel them scrape at my soul.

Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Athnalu came under the belief that the [[Sayormi]] people&mdash;a mysterious [[Species/Legends|species]] that lived in the [[Dead Forest (Kashyyyk)|Dead Forest]] of the Kkowir [[Forest/Legends|Forest]]&mdash;had placed a spell on her. She thought herself possessed and cursed by the Sayormi. Believing that her very [[Soul/Legends|soul]] was rotting away, Athnalu lived in constant pain and fear, which caused her to grow increasingly mentally unstable.<ref name=\"Rage\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nThat same [[Standard year/Legends|year]], Athnalu was approached by a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who was visiting her village. Athnalu explained her situation and the curse she believed she was under and pleaded for the spacer to help her. The spacer accepted the Wookiee's request for assistance, and Athnalu tasked the traveler with collecting five [[Voodoo/Legends|voodoo dolls]] that she thought the Sayormi were using to possess her. By having the dolls, Athnalu hoped they would help her understand why the Sayormi had placed the curse on her. After the spacer had completed the task and returned to Athnalu, the Wookiee rewarded the being with 1,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].<ref name=\"Rage\" />\n\nHowever, unsatisfied with the results from the dolls, Athnalu again asked the spacer for assistance. The spacer agreed, and Athnalu told the traveler to find three more items that she thought were needed to cure her: the [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] of a [[shadevale]], [[Snake/Legends|snakes]] that lived in the nearby [[lake]]s and streams; hairs from a [[mouf]], large, woolly creatures that wandered the forest; and finally a [[Mysess blossom]], a [[Plant/Legends|flower]] that grew in the village. The spacer dutifully collected all she requested and brought them to Athnalu, which the Wookiee mixed together into a potion and consumed. Now satisfied that she was free of the curse's influence, she thanked the spacer and rewarded the being with another 1,200 credits and a special [[ceremonial chair]] from the village.<ref name=\"Rage\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|Please&hellip;before it's too late! I can feel their hands around my soul, squeezing tighter. All hope is lost to me. My mind aches&hellip;|Athnalu|Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees}}\nWhile thinking herself under the power of a Sayormi curse, Athnalu became crazed and unbalanced, believing her very soul was [[Death/Legends|dying]]. She heard voices inside her head, which brought her a great deal of pain and suffering and caused her to whimper at [[Time/Legends|times]]. When the spacer attempted to talk to her, Athnalu acted distant, often looking off into space or occasionally not responding to the being's questions.<ref name=\"Rage\" />\n\nAthnalu was desperate to find a cure for her supposed curse, at one point grabbing onto the spacer's shoulder and demanding that the traveler find her the five voodoo dolls, injuring the spacer in the process. Athnalu had light [[brown]] hair, [[purple]] eyes, and spoke the [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]] [[Language/Legends|language]].<ref name=\"Rage\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAthnalu made her first appearance in [[2005]]'s [[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees|''Rage of the Wookiees'']], an expansion pack for the [[Video game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. In the game, Athnalu has a pair of quests the player can undertake, known as \"A Possessed Soul\" and \"Athnalu's Cure.\" Although the player may choose to not take part in Athnalu's quests, this article assumes 100 percent game completion.\n\nAthnalu later appeared on a card in the ''[[Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game]]'' expansion set ''[[Squadrons Over Corellia]]''&mdash;released in [[2008]]&mdash;which depicts the Wookiee and is also entitled \"A Possessed Soul.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Rage of the Wookiees}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Squadrons Over Corellia|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Squadrons_Over_Corellia#Card_gallery|cardname=A Possessed Soul}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|A Possessed Soul}}\n*{{SWGWiki|Athnalu's Cure}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
