For many [[Standard year/Legends|years]], Dreezian had an arrangement with the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Starship/Legends|shipping]] magnate [[Cilyn Gara]] whereby Gara's starships would transport spice for Dreezian. However, the pair eventually fell out and Gara refused to transport any more goods for Dreezian, so the crime lord covertly arranged for the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] [[Kodi Vilthar]] to [[Death/Legends|murder]] Gara. Dreezian then planned to persuade Gara's daughter, [[Magda Gara]], to allow him to make use of her father's ships. In addition, Dreezian also planned to eliminate Vilthar, to prevent anyone from connecting Cilyn Gara's death to Dreezian.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dreezian, Yustavan}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
