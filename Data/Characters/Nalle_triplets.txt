The Nalle triplets reported to the mayor any useful information their guests foolishly divulged.\n\nThey were in the [[Outlander Club/Legends|Outlander Club]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] before the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|outbreak]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMya Nalle, Yma Nalle and Lela Mayn, seen in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']], were all portrayed by an uncredited [[Amy Allen]]. All of the triplets' names are anagrams of her name.\n\nThe shot in which Mya and Yma Nalle appear was completed after principal photography using a limited number of actors and costumes, with some being duplicated to better populate the shot. The idea of the Nalle triplets was used to explain why two such similar-looking women appeared in one shot, with Lela Mayn later being confirmed as the third Nalle sister.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Evasive Action: Recruitment]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|acros_krik|Acros-Krik|archivedate=20100329224919}}\n*{{DB|character|lelamayn|Mayn, Lela Nalle|archivedate=20100202123346}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Nalle Triplets\n|pl=Trojaczki Nalle\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
