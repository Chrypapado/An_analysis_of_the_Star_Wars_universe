The Empire [[Propaganda/Legends|propagandized]] the [[Second Battle of Ord Biniir]] in hope of offsetting coverage of the loss of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] in the major defeat at [[Yavin Prime/Legends|Yavin]]. Taken by the newly-minted hero Fel, himself a Corellian, Starflare introduced herself to the Imperial [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], whisking him away from a pair of [[Senator/Legends|senators]] who were attempting to regale him with old war stories.

At the same time, she learned that her brother Wedge Antilles had survived the explosion that killed their parents, and as the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] increased in intensity, was becoming increasingly prominent as an [[Ace/Legends|ace]] pilot in the Rebel Alliance. She worried that her secret connection to the Rebel hero would bring down her career and Fel's with her.

After she finally confessed her background to him and explained her fears, Fel argued that they were unlikely to be tainted by her brother's actions, and that they were already a couple and thus subject to any repercussions. Starflare conceded that she could not allow her fear to deny her a chance at happiness, and accepted Fel's proposal.

Fearing that Isard might eventually move against them and certain she would uncover the secret of Starflare's origins, Fel told Starflare to prepare a plan to flee and disappear beyond Isard's reach on his signal, but not to tell him what her plans were.

The Chiss authorities denied them permission to travel through Chiss [[Realspace/Legends|space]], but allowed them use of the [[Expeditionary Library]] to search for information about Zonama Sekot.

I can't&hellip;|Syal Antilles Fel, to Saba Sebatyne, speaking of Soontir Fel|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee}}\nThough Syal Antilles loved her family, she did not want the kind of life that Gus Treta offered her.<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" /> She ran away from home, seeking a more sophisticated lifestyle. She found it on Coruscant, becoming an acclaimed [[holostar]].<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> She lived estranged from her family, but regretted their distance and wanted to make amends with them.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" /><ref name=\"Masquerade\" /> Before she could do so, however, she learned that her parents had died.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" />\n\n[[File:Fel_Syal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Soontir Fel's proposal to Starflare shocked her into revealing her secret identity as Syal Antilles.]]\nAfter Wedge Antilles emerged as a Rebel hero, Starflare had to live with the fear that her connection to her brother would be exposed and her career ruined. That fear was heightened by falling in love with Soontir Fel, a fellow Corellian and Imperial hero. She was terrified not only that a marriage to Fel would expose him to a potential downfall as well, but that, as an Imperial pilot, he might eventually battle her brother and one would kill the other. It took Fel's assurances that their love was greater than the fear of possible future consequences for her to agree to set aside her worries and marry Fel, with whom she was greatly in love.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" />\n\nDespite her role as a prominent Imperial figure, Wynssa Starflare was not a political ideologue.<ref name=\"Fact File\" /> She was more concerned that her husband return safely to her than that the war be carried to the Rebellion and New Republic, and would have eagerly had her duty-bound husband abandon the war if they only could live safely.<ref name=\"In the Empire's Service\" /> When Fel defected to the New Republic, she followed him, and was happy to have her husband and brother on the same side of the war. When Fel then joined the Empire of the Hand, she did so as well.<ref name=\"Fact File\" />\n\nLiving in the harsh Unknown Regions, with her husband and most of her children in the military and serving in combat, she worried deeply about their safety.<ref name=\"Refugee\" /><ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" /> Of her six children, she lost half of them to war by the time she was sixty-six.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /> She initially wanted her husband to send his forces into the known galaxy to aid her brother and the New Republic in battling the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, but after the fall of Coruscant, she became convinced that the Yuuzhan Vong could not be defeated. Though she knew intellectually that withdrawing and remaining in the Unknown Regions would not save her family from the invaders, she could not overcome her fear of joining the war effort. She finally could take no more of warfare, and was unwilling to face the loss of yet more of her family. Saba Sebatyne and Danni Quee helped assure her that her family's only true chance at safety lay in fighting and defeating the Yuuzhan Vong, and she came to accept that she could not escape her husband and children's commitment to battling the threats to the galaxy.<ref name=\"Refugee\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] writer [[Michael A. Stackpole]] created the character Syal Antilles Fel in the [[1997]] [[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: In the Empire's Service|''In the Empire's Service'']] arc of that comic. The character initially appeared unnamed, as Soontir Fel's wife. The final panel of that arc revealed that this wife was the sister of Wedge Antilles.<ref name=\"In the Empire's Service\" /> The next issue, [[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]], used flashbacks to tell Soontir Fel's life story, and it established the backstory of Syal Antilles and her stage name Wynssa Starflare.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" /> It was not until ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', released in [[2008]], that the character's married name was canonically established as Syal Antilles Fel.<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" />\n\nThough Syal Antilles Fel was mentioned in further material concerned with Soontir Fel, Wedge Antilles, her son Jagged Fel, and her niece Syal Antilles, her only further narrative appearance was in the novel ''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]'', published in [[2003]].<ref name=\"Masquerade\" /><ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" /><ref name=\"Refugee\" /><ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Solo Command\" /><ref name=\"Family Ties\" /><ref name=\"Iron Fist\" /><ref name=\"Ruin\" /> Of those stories that mention her, only ''[[Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor]]'' and ''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]'' have mentioned her outside the context of her relationship to those other characters, both making mention of holostar Wynssa Starflare.<ref name=\"Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor\" /><ref name=\"Backlash\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Syal Antilles Fel}}\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 22|''X-Wing
