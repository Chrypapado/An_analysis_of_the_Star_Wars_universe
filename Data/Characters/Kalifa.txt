Here, we are survivors.|Kalifa, to Ahsoka Tano|Padawan Lost}}\n'''Kalifa''' was a [[Gender|female]] [[human]] [[Jedi]] [[Jedi Initiate|youngling]] of the [[Jedi Order]] during the final [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"Padawan Lost\" />\n\nShe was captured and taken to [[Garnac]]'s [[Garnac's hunting guild|hunting guild]] on the moon [[Wasskah]]. After being released on [[Island Four]] on [[Wasskah]], she led a small team with two other [[youngling]] captives, [[O-Mer]] and [[Jinx]], managing to survive by staying hidden and out of combat with the members of Garnac's hunting guild.<ref name=\"Padawan Lost\" />\n\nAfter her capture by [[Lo-Taren]] and subsequent transfer to [[Island Four]], [[Ahsoka Tano]] was determined to change the indifference Kalifa, [[O-Mer]], and [[Jinx]] showed toward the other prisoners as they are hunted. After Ahsoka ambushed a lone [[Trandoshan]], Kalifa levitated him with a [[Force choke]] and attempted to kill him, but was stopped by Ahsoka, convincing her not to kill the hunter out of hatred. The captive Trandoshan was then able to call for help and the Jedi were forced to retreat. After the successful ambush, Kalifa began to hope that Ahsoka, as a more advanced [[Force-sensitive|Force user]], could help them escape.<ref name=\"Padawan Lost\" />\n\nThe next morning the hunting resumed, forcing the group to split up. Kalifa accompanied Ahsoka and was shot off a briar branch landing, winded and injured, on the ground, with [[Dar]] in hot pursuit. Before he could shoot her, Ahsoka ambushed Dar and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, which ended with him falling on a stalagmite, killing him. Enraged, Garnac, who was Dar's father, opened fire on the two young Jedi, fatally injuring Kalifa. In her final moments, she made Ahsoka promise to look after the others, dying as Ahsoka stayed by her side until the end.<ref name=\"Padawan Lost\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Padawan Lost}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|Wookiee Hunt}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode321.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Padawan Lost|archivedate=20110902013605}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Three|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' The Complete Season Three]]\n*{{SWE|characters|kalifa|Kalifa}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{Databank|kalifa|Kalifa|archivedate=20200325193312}}\n*{{Databank|trandosha|Trandosha|archivedate=20160520205337}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kalifa\n|es=Kalifa\n|ja=\u30ab\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\n|pl=Kalifa\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]"}}}]}}}}
