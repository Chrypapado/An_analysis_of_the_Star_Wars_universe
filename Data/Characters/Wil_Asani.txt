However, they were interrupted by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], and Asani was forced to put the data on his computer. After fleeing through a tunnel, Asani and Antin took Flume, [[Fy-Tor-Ana|Solace]] and [[Oryon]] to a landing platform in order to escape the [[Planet/Legends|planet]].\n\nWhen Flume returned to [[Bellassa/Legends|Bellassa]] with Solace and Oryon, Asani and Antin helpeded to find where Telemark and Lands were being held for trial.

After leaving the planet, Asani traveled with the other opposition leaders to the [[Jedi asteroid]] where they would remain hidden from the Empire. As the [[Transpirator/Legends|transpirator]] the ship broke and they had to stop over, Asani and Ferus discovered a tracking device on board. While he remained on the base, it was revealed that [[Toma (resistance leader)|Toma]] was serving as [[Spy/Legends|spy]] to the Empire and was the one who activated the tracking device which allowed [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] and the Empire to find the resistance leaders.
