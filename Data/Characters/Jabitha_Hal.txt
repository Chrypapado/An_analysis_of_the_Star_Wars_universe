She survived the [[First Battle of Zonama Sekot|attack]] by the [[Yuuzhan Vong|Far Outsiders]]&mdash;the name the Sekotans gave the [[Yuuzhan Vong]]&mdash;but her [[Unidentified Magister|father]] was killed. However, [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Sekot]] made a mental image of her father, so that everyone believed that he was still alive.\n\nIn [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], she briefly befriended [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], who named [[Jabitha|his ship]] after her. After the [[Second Battle of Zonama Sekot]], Jabitha was on the planet when it disappeared into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] towards the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]].\n===Yuuzhan Vong War===\nSome time later she herself became Magister. When [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and his team arrived on Zonama Sekot seeking help in defeating the Yuuzhan Vong, Jabitha was hesitant to act, but welcomed them out of memory of Anakin. Finally convinced that their intentions were good, she was instrumental in helping Sekot decide to join the [[New Jedi Order]] in attempting to peacefully resolve the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rogue Planet]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|As \"Jabitha\"}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box|\n|title=[[Magister]] of [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]]\n|years=?&mdash;?\n|before=[[Unidentified Magister]]\n|after=\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jabitha Hal\n|es=Jabitha Hal\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0425\u0430\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hal, Jabitha}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ferroans]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Magisters of Zonama Sekot]]\n[[Category:Near-Human Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Sekotans]]"}}}]}}}}
