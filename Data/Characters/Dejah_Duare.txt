After the [[Caamas Firestorm|Destruction of Caamas]], she feared for Volette's safety and contacted former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jax Pavan]] for help in escaping [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. However when the pair arrived at Volette's apartment to meet him, they found him [[Death/Legends|dead]]. After they found [[Umber 3PO unit|Volette's murderer]], however, she turned back on her decision to leave Coruscant and instead joined with Pavan and [[Whiplash]], a resistance group to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\nShe attempted to form a relationship with Pavan, but he rejected her advance, leading her to betray Pavan and his group to [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. She desired to experience [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] fully, but Pavan denied her this wish by shutting himself away from her. However, she managed to find the exact opposite in [[Probus Tesla]], a member of the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]].\n\nBefore long, Pavan's friend [[Laranth Tarak]] and a young [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Kajin Savaros]] were captured by the Empire and taken to the [[ISB Central Office/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]]. Pavan organized a [[Battle in the Imperial Security Bureau|rescue mission]], but upon their arrival in the building, Duare revealed that she had betrayed him. Vader then ordered Pavan to hand over a vial of [[bota]]&mdash;a substance that was recorded to have the ability to strengthen a Force-sensitive's ability to touch the Force&mdash;but when he refused, Vader attacked Pavan. Tarak then revealed that she had the bota, and Vader took it and injected it into himself. However, the bota caused Vader to lose all control over his powers, and he began hurling Force energy in all directions. While the other beings present ran for cover, Duare remained in the open, as she greatly enjoyed the feeling of the Force. However, one of Vader's Force-blasts caught her and slammed her against the wall, killing her.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDejah's name is spelled \"Deejah\" on the back of ''Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows'', but \"Dejah\" throughout the book.\n\nDejah Duare was named after two of Edgar Rice Burroughs' heroines in his works; Dejah Thoris of Mars and Duare of Venus.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Coruscant Nights III: Patterns of Force]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dejah Duare#legends\n|pl=Dejah Duare\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duare, Dejah}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Whiplash members]]\n[[Category:Zeltrons]]"}}}]}}}}
