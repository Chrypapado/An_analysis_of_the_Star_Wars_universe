He served as [[bartender]] at [[the Lodge]] on the [[planet]] [[Vandor]] in the time of the [[Galactic Empire]]. While working there, he came to know [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], and other visitors to the Lodge with stories to tell. Bilure wrote a [[book]] to recording the stories he witnessed and heard from his patrons.<ref name=\"Tales from Vandor\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nTivoche Bilure was born on [[Corellia]] and grew up in an overcrowded, working-class neighborhood in [[Coronet City]] that never received any attention from the authorities. His family never had the [[Credit|money]] to buy enough [[Foodstuff|food]]. As a boy, he tended [[mobile furnace]]s at the Coronet City shipbreaking yards. Bilure worried about growing old and developing [[Shipbreaker's Cough]] like his [[Tivoche Bilure's father|father]], and spending his life working hard for credits, but never having enough. Unwilling to live that life, Bilure saved up his money and signed up to work for passage aboard the [[Bulk freighter|bulk]] [[freighter]] ''[[Rampaea Horizon]]''. After working off the price of his ticket, he continued working for wages and studied each planet the Horizon stopped at from a [[datapad]] to decide if he wanted to stay there. When the [[Starship|ship]] landed on Vandor, Bilure knew without researching beforehand that this was the right planet for him, citing the clean [[Atmosphere|air]] and wide sky.<ref name=\"Tales from Vandor\" />\n\n===Settling on Vandor===\nAfter Tivoche Bilure settled on Vandor he took a wide variety of jobs to earn a living. He would visit [[the Lodge]] in [[Fort Ypso]] and connect with people looking to hire workers. His first job involved riding a [[speeder bike]] to round up [[kod'yok]]s and skinning the creatures using a [[laser knife]]. He later came to regret this because of how small the kod'yok herds became. His next position involved climbing [[Big Rock]] to help set up a [[comm repeater]]. When the Empire arrived on Vandor, Bilure took a position laying [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport|conveyex]] tracks across [[Spinnaker Raider]] [[Spinnaker Raider territory|territory]]. Bilure and his work crew had to lay down the tracks three times, as the Spinnakers tore up the track each time they finished. The third time, the Spinnakers attacked the workers as soon as they arrived. Bilure hid under a kod'yok skin and was the only one survive the attack. While returning to the base camp, Bilure was attacked by a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE Fighter]] [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|pilot]] who mistook him for a raider.<ref name=\"Tales from Vandor\" />\n\nOne night when Bilure was at the Lodge, the owner, [[Tibbs Ospe]], needed someone to help refire the slug feeder for the [[slug furnace]]. Bilure was able to do the job thanks to his experience with mobile furnaces as a boy. Every time he visited the Lodge thereafter, Tibbs found odd jobs for him help out with, until he offered Bilure room and board if he stayed around to help out. One night, a party of skinners came into the Lodge just as the last barkeep's shift ended, so Bilure stayed up overnight to take care of the guets. After hearing Bilure's talent for talking with the visitors, Tibbs offered him the position of overnight [[bartender]] full time.<ref name=\"Tales from Vandor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTivoche Bilure was first mentioned in [[Jason Fry]]'s [[2018]] replica journal book ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]''. When questioned about the veracity of Bilure's stories, Fry stated \"Personally, I wouldn't trust anything Midnight tells you.\"<ref name=\"Twit\">\n{{Twitter|jasoncfry|status/1040234936387690496|[[Jason Fry]]|quote=Personally, I wouldn't trust anything Midnight tells you.|image=File:MidnightTweet.png|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916065430/https:/twitter.com/jasoncfry/status/1040234936387690496}}</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bilure, Tivoche}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
