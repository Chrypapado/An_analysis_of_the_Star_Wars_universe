Darillian had a tremendous ego &ndash; despite having a boring job, he kept his logs in full-holographic format. [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] Darillian last saw Coruscant exactly two years, seven months, and six days before the [[Battle of Ession]]. He was effectively exiled from his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] after former [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]] [[Mission above Imperial City|lost]] the planet to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], and his [[Zurel Darillian's wife|wife]] [[Death/Legends|died]] when the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]'' launched from its berth beneath Coruscant, destroying the Darillian's home.\n\nHis primary duties under Zsinj included diplomatic visits to allied planets and companies and making overtures to organizations Zsinj wished to recruit into his empire. Additionally, ''Night Caller'' was one of the ships Zsinj, and later Admiral Trigit, assigned to lay [[empion mine]]s and investigate their detonation. His final mission, a routine investigation of a mine activation, brought ''Night Caller'' into conflict with [[Wraith Squadron]].\n\nAs ''Night Caller'' scanned a derelict [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]], Wraith pilot [[Voort saBinring]] boarded the corvette aboard a cargo pod, armed with a modified X-wing laser cannon. The laser's destructive power exceeded the Wraiths' expectations, and when saBinring fired it into the deck above the hangar it blew a hole all the way to the bridge. Captain Darillian was directly in the line of fire, and was killed instantly.\n\nThough Darillian himself ended up splattered on the ceiling of his bridge, [[Garik Loran]] impersonated him through the [[Battle of Ession]] in order to collect intelligence on Zsinj.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zurel Darillian#legends\n|ru=\u0417\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043b \u0414\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b\u044c\u044f\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darillian, Zurel}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Intelligence personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy captains of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Zsinj's empire]]"}}}]}}}}
