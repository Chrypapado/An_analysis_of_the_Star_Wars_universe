When [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], visited the Refugee Sector, the Twi'lek offered her information for a few [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Surik paid the Twi'lek for his information; he informed her that if she had a [[Stealth field generator/Legends|stealth field generator]] and some security skills, she could rob the [[Exchange]] criminal organization's compound in the area without anyone noticing.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|I can give you a tip on how you can get some good loot.|Kaul|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nAn [[Information broker/Legends|infochant]] by trade, Kaul was an [[orange]]-skinned, [[blue]]-[[Eye/Legends|eyed]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] who lived in the [[Refugee Sector]] on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], the largest [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]].

He knew much about the [[Exchange]], a criminal organization on the moon.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|204|Kaul}}</ref>\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nDuring that time, the [[Human/Legends|Human]] female known as [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], was on the moon searching for [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]]. While visiting the Refugee Sector, the Exile spoke with Kaul, who offered her some information in exchange for twenty [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Surik was skeptical and wished to know the nature of the information, and Kaul replied that it would lead to some good loot. Surik agreed and paid Kaul the twenty credits, and he told her that there were containers in the Exchange camp that were filled with supplies. He suggested that if Surik used a [[Stealth field generator/Legends|stealth field generator]] and some security skills, she could steal them without the guards noticing.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|If I had the skills needed for the task, I wouldn't be stuck here on Nar Shaddaa, now would I?|Kaul|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nKaul was very knowledgeable about the inner workings of the Exchange's criminal dealings on Nar Shaddaa<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> and had information on where the group kept its supplies within its compound in the Refugee Sector. He did not have the skills necessary to take advantage of the information himself; if he had, he would have left Nar Shaddaa, where he felt he was \"stuck.\" Kaul spoke [[Twi'leki/Legends|Twi'leki]] and was capable of understanding [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKaul's first appearance in [[canon]] is as a non-player character in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', in which the player, the Jedi Exile, can interact with him. The player can choose to either pay for his information or not. While the information he gives the player is correct, speaking with him is not required to continue the game's plot or to steal from the aforementioned containers. Therefore, it is undetermined whether the Jedi Exile ever interacted with Kaul and, if so, what form their conversation took, and whether she paid for his information or not.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kaul\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
