That's a direct order.|Captain Kael, to Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\n'''Kael''' was a [[Captain/Legends|captain]] in the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]] during the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation's]] [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|invasion]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]. He and his subordinate, [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Gavyn Sykes]], [[Fall of Theed|escaped]] from the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Theed/Legends|Theed]], organized a [[Naboo Underground|resistance]] against the invaders and [[Skirmishes in the Naboo countryside|rescued]] several [[Naboo (people)/Legends|civilians]] from the Federation's [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]]. Kael and Sykes eventually [[Mission to the Naboo mountains|allied]] with an influential [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], [[Borvo]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], who supplied them with [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighters]]. Determined to strike back at the enemy, Kael and his men performed a daring [[Attack on disabled base|raid]] on a Trade Federation [[Trade Federation base|base]], stealing a [[Ostracoda-class gunboat|Federation gunboat]].\n\nGuided by Kael, Sykes used the gunboat to [[Liberation of slave camps|infiltrate]] a Federation [[Mining/Legends|mining]] operation on the banks of the [[Andrevea River]] and rescued a number of [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]]. Borvo, however, later enslaved the rescued prisoners by himself. Kael fell victim to the Hutt's treachery, and was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by him. Before dying, though, he was able to inform Sykes of what had happened, and the Lieutenant [[Attack on Porso Hill|defeated]] Borvo. Sykes went on to play a crucial role in the liberation of Naboo, helping to [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|take down]] the Federation's [[Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship|droid control ship]] and free the planet.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Sykes.

Ah.|Captain Kael's last words to Sykes|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\nKael was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Naboo (people)/Legends|native]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], who joined the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]] at a very young age. Possessing clear characteristics of leadership, he was quickly promoted to an [[Officer/Legends|officer]] and was assigned to train new [[Troop/Legends|troops]]. Kael seldom left Naboo, instead spending [[Time/Legends|time]] sharpening his survival skills in the [[Naboo swamps|swamps]]. Eventually, Kael rose in [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] to [[Captain/Legends|captain]], with [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Gavyn Sykes]] under his command.<ref name=\"Website\" /> In [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> Kael, Sykes, and the RSF leader, Captain [[Quarsh Panaka/Legends|Quarsh Panaka]], acted as an escort to a Naboo delegation, traveling to the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Once on the planet, though, the delegation was [[Coruscant Encounter|attacked]] by a mysterious [[Starship/Legends|starship]] and Sykes had to pursue the ship. After a chase through the streets of Coruscant, Sykes successfully drove away the attacker.<ref name=\"BfN\" /> The [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] held an investigation, but was unable to discern the identity of the attacker, who had been in fact the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]], piloting his [[Scimitar/Legends|Sith Infiltrator]] and acting on his [[Sith Master/Legends|Master]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]]' orders.<ref name=\"Starships & Vehicles 62\">''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 62]]''</ref> A short time later, Naboo was [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|invaded]] by the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] as an act of protest against the Galactic Senate's [[Senate Resolution BR-0371|taxation]] of trade [[Hyperlane|routes]] to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Star system/Legends|star systems]],<ref name=\"TPM\">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> and the Federation [[Trade Federation Droid Army/Legends|droid army]] [[Fall of Theed|attacked]] the capital [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Theed/Legends|Theed]]. Kael, who was riding a [[Seraph-class urban landspeeder|Flash speeder]] at the time, was pinned down by [[Droideka/Legends|droidekas]] near the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces headquarters|RSF headquarters]]. His [[Landspeeder/Legends|speeder]] was damaged and the weapons systems malfunctioned, so Kael was forced to call in Sykes, requesting assistance. Sykes rescued Kael, and the two made their way through the city, soon finding two parked Trade Federation [[STAP-2|Heavy STAPs]]. After Sykes destroyed the enemy forces guarding the vehicles, he and Kael traded their speeders for the [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform/Legends|STAPs]] and left Theed for the countryside.<ref name=\"BfN\" />\n\n[[File:KaelAndSykesSundayDrive-BFN.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kael and Sykes on Heavy STAPs, after escaping from Theed.]]\nThe two [[Skirmishes in the Naboo countryside|helped]] local civilians fight off [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droid]] attacks, but the Trade Federation greatly outnumbered the officers. Kael then decided to go to the nearby [[Trading village (Naboo swamps)|village]] in the swamps and find some help from [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] who lived there. Kael and Sykes switched to [[N-X Police Cruiser/Legends|N-X Police Cruisers]] and soon arrived at the village, which had already been attacked by the Federation. In the midst of the battle, the village leader, [[Rohan Wayside]], tried to rescue his people on [[Naboo houseboat|houseboats]] and requested aid from Kael and Sykes. Responding to the call, they repelled the attack and rescued the village's police officer, [[Vedd Deviss]], who had been pinned down at the far end of the village by [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I/Legends|droid starfighters]]. In gratitude, Wayside told them about an influential [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] somewhere in the mountains who could help them in their cause. The village leader then sent Deviss to escort Kael and Sykes to the smuggler.<ref name=\"BfN\" />\n\nWhen they [[Mission to the Naboo mountains|approached]] the mountains, however, Sykes's craft was shot down by a droid [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] patrol, and the Lieutenant was forced to land and take a Flash speeder. The group then had to split&mdash;Sykes went to search for the smuggler in the northern passage, while Kael and Deviss took the eastern passage. Eventually, Sykes found the smuggler&mdash;[[Borvo]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]&mdash;and rescued him from a Federation attack. Borvo agreed to help the [[Naboo Underground|resistance]] and asked the officers to escort him to his base in the mountains. Sykes did not trust the Hutt, but Kael believed that they should try their luck with Borvo. Kael, Sykes, and Deviss escorted the Hutt to his base&mdash;which contained an [[N-1 assembly site]]&mdash;and repelled the Trade Federation attack on it. With [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighters]] now in their hands, Kael and Borvo devised a plan to strike back at the Federation. They decided to raid [[Trade Federation base|one]] of the Trade Federation's bases on the planet, which was controlled by an [[Orbit/Legends|orbital]] [[Satellite/Legends|satellite]] designated [[Comm 4]].<ref name=\"BfN\" />\n\nKael, Sykes, Deviss, and two of Borvo's [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]]&mdash;[[Adela Tych\u00e9]] and [[Kol Kotha]]&mdash;flew into [[Realspace/Legends|space]] to [[Disruption of Comm 4|take down]] Comm 4. However, they soon discovered that Comm 4 was protected by a powerful [[Deflector shield/Legends|shield]] projected by three slave satellites nearby. Sykes was able to destroy the three satellites, and the group successfully took down Comm 4. Returning to the planet, the five pilots [[Attack on disabled base|attacked]] the disabled Federation base, hoping to destroy all enemy craft and equipment located there, and capture a [[Ostracoda-class gunboat|Trade Federation gunboat]] for the resistance. The base, however, was soon reactivated, so Kael and the others had to fight their way through to the gunboat launch site, where Sykes stole a gunboat. Kael, believing that the enemy would mistake the Lieutenant for a retreating [[Neimoidian/Legends|Neimoidian]], ordered his subordinate to go up the [[Andrevea River]] to recon what the Federation was up to there. Kael was soon contacted by Sykes via a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]]. The Lieutenant had spotted an enemy patrol and panicked; Kael calmed him and ordered him to proceed further. Sykes then found a Federation [[Mining/Legends|mining]] camp on the bank of the river and [[Liberation of slave camps|liberated]] some Naboo [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] held there. Borvo provided [[Transport/Legends|transports]] to evacuate them, and Sykes proceeded to another camp to rescue more prisoners. Dispatching Deviss to assist Sykes, Kael and another resistance pilot, [[Lutin Hollis/Legends|Lutin Hollis]], set off in N-1 starfighters to escort Borvo's transports to a safe location.<ref name=\"BfN\" />\n\n[[File:Kael's_downed_N-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kael's downed N-1 starfighter.]]\nOn their way, though, they were ambushed; Kael was shot down and crashed his starship, while Hollis was able to escape. Kael survived the crash, but was gravely wounded and remained near his craft. He realized that the ambush was orchestrated by Borvo, and that the Hutt was planning to enslave the rescued prisoners. Soon, the Trade Federation located Kael and started [[Bomber/Legends|bombing]] the surrounding area, hoping to finish him off. The attackers, though, were dispatched by Sykes, who had been informed by Hollis of what had happened and [[Search for Captain Kael|located]] Kael. Revealing to Sykes that Borvo had betrayed them and had enslaved the Naboo people, Kael urged the Lieutenant to rescue the slaves. After wishing Sykes luck, Kael succumbed to his wounds and [[Death/Legends|died]]. Sykes [[Attack on Porso Hill|went after]] the Hutt, forced him to retreat to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], and liberated the slaves. The Lieutenant continued to fight against the Federation, participating in the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|final assault]] on the enemy [[Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship|droid control ship]] and helping the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] to destroy it, thus liberating Naboo.<ref name=\"BfN\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What if he's leading us into a trap?''\"<br />\"''It's a risk I'm willing to take. The Hutt might have the weapons we need to recapture Theed.|Kael made the fatal choice to ally with Borvo, although he and Sykes did not trust the Hutt|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\nSince a very young age, Kael displayed great leadership skills, which helped him to quickly rise in rank in the Royal Security Forces. As an officer, he was tough to his troops, but they respected him, and Kael enjoyed training them. Kael was fond of his home planet<ref name=\"Website\" /> and was determined to liberate it from the Trade Federation, but he also kept his head cool, trying not to underestimate the enemy, calming Sykes when he panicked, and telling him to return to the mission when the latter got sidetracked to rescue some [[Farm/Legends|farmers]] on one occasion.<ref name=\"BfN\" /> Kael knew the value of local knowledge of the terrain, which was why he decided to turn to the merchants living in the swamp. Even though Kael did not trust Borvo, he realized that the resistance would need the Hutt's help in order to have any hopes of liberating the planet.<ref name=\"Starships & Vehicles 62\" /> The alliance with Borvo, however, resulted in Kael's death. Even on the brink of his death, Kael was worried for the people enslaved by Borvo, and he told Sykes to rescue them.<ref name=\"BfN\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Sykes, take out those fighters!
