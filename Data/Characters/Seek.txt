When Seek was ten, in [[32 BBY]],<ref name=\"Birth\" /> he and a group of other children visited his friend [[Anakin Skywalker]]<ref name=\"Geektionary\">''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''</ref> in a courtyard of [[Slave Quarters Row]] in [[Mos Espa]] [[spaceport]].<ref name=\"CompleteLocations\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> Skywalker was working on his [[Anakin Skywalker's Podracer|podracer]] and revealed that he was going to participate in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing|podrace]] taking place the next [[Standard day|day]], causing the children [[Kitster Banai]], [[Wald]], [[Amee]], and [[Melee]] to express doubts about his chances.<ref name=\"TPM\" />\n\nUnimpressed by Skywalker's [[Technician|mechanical]] talents, Seek was so indifferent that he suggested that the group go and play a ball game. He then cruelly predicted that Skywalker would crash during the race<ref name=\"Geektionary\" /> before he and all of the group bar Banai left while giggling. Skywalker instead won the race and subsequently left Tatooine. Seek had light, freckled skin and dark [[eye]]s. He wore brown and gray [[robe]]s with a black [[scarf]] and brown [[belt]].<ref name=\"TPM\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|It was just the most exciting thing to see your child get a part in a film like this. We were treated like royalty in Tunisia. It was just a fantastic experience.|Alison Walpole|url=https://archive.is/qlFdP}}\nSeek was portrayed by [[Oliver Walpole]] in the [[1999]] [[prequel trilogy]] film, [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]. His name was not stated in the film but was given in the credits.<ref name=\"TPM\" /> Walpole is the son of the film's set decorator, [[Peter Walpole]], and visited [[Leavesden Studios]] with his father to see the sets. As Oliver was the same size as [[Jake Lloyd]], who played Anakin Skywalker, he tried out one of the podracers seen in the film. Director [[George Lucas]] spotted Oliver in the vehicle and suggested that he take a screen test. Two weeks later, Oliver learned that he had a speaking part in the film and was flown out with his mother, Alison, to [[Wikipedia:Tunisia|Tunisia]] to shoot for ten days.<ref name=\"ForceNet\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.theforce.net/episode1/story/article_on_oliver_walpole_79549.asp|title=Article on Oliver Walpole|author=Scott|date=1999-07-13|work=[[TheForce.net]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qlFdP|archivedate=2021-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] {{1st}}\n\n===Non-canon appearances===\n*''[[William Shakespeare's The Phantom of Menace: Star Wars Part the First]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-a-family-affair|text=''Star Wars'', A Family Affair}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0421\u0438\u043a/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
