Well, the hotel's open for you and I guess I got to answer any questions you want, too.|Ignus to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Ignus''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who was the owner and proprietor of the [[Visitor's Hotel]] in [[Ahto City]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nAs one of the witnesses in the [[Sunry]] murder investigation and [[Sunry vs. the Ahto City Authority|trial]], he was interviewed by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] in his appointed capacity as the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] [[Arbiter/Legends|arbiter]]. When questioned, he would testify to the fact that Sunry probably left after the [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shot that [[Death/Legends|killed]] the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] officer and [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]], [[Elassa Huros]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the player walked the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark path]], Revan persuaded or bribed Ignus to testify that Sunry left before the blaster shot. [[Juhani]] and [[Mission Vao]], if either one is in your party, will strongly protest this action, and [[Bastila Shan]] will also express some reservations about \u201cplanting evidence.\u201d [[Jolee Bindo]] and [[Carth Onasi]] will not question the morality of your action, but will worry aloud that the Selkath authorities may find out.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ignus\n|fr=Ignus\n|pl=Ignus\n|ru=\u0418\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0441\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]"}}}]}}}}
