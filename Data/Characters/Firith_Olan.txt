It was rumored that he possessed knowledge of the location of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt's]] secret weapons cache, located somewhere in the [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] desert.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:XWRS10BT2-FC.jpg|left|thumb|Firith Olan with the disembodied Bib Fortuna.]]\n\nThe black-sheep son of a wealthy family from [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]], Olan was a minor crimelord who believed that, following Jabba the Hutt's death, he could step in and take control of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] criminal empire. He had somehow managed to gain control of the [[BT-16 perimeter droid|brain walker]] that contained [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna's]] brain, and took great pleasure in the fact that Fortuna still retained useful information about Jabba.\n\nIn order to obtain the weapons cache, he had to put [[Huff Darklighter]] out of business, because Darklighter had learned of its existence. In the midst of this power struggle, [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] was sent to discover if the cache existed. [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces were also sent in to retrieve the cache, stored at the so-called [[Eidolon Base]].\n\nOlan was [[Tatooine Campaign|captured]] by [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Marl Semtin]] and returned to [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]], in an attempt to draw off the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic's]] forces. Semtin later freed him as a way to gain the confidence of the Twi'leki head clans, but caught him again at Eidolon Base. Semtin stabbed Olan before escaping, and Bib Fortuna's brain walker took advantage of the situation. Fortuna had been trailing Olan, waiting for just such an opportunity to exact revenge. Fortuna dragged Olan's body to the [[B'omarr Order/Legends|B'omarr Monks]] and had them swap brains.\n\nOlan was forced to spend the rest of his conscious existence in the brain walker, while Fortuna used his body to try and rebuild Jabba's empire. To this end, he started a relationship with [[Shiri'ani]], the owner and operator of the [[Lucky Star (Mos Entha)|Lucky Star]] hotel and casino, and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Valarian/Legends|Valarian]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|60|Who's Who in Jabba's Palace}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook]]''\n*{{FFCite|82|TWI14, ''Twi'leks''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 6]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Rebellion Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{DB|character|bibfortuna|Fortuna, Bib|archivedate=20110524235153}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Firith Olan\n|ru=\u0424\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u041e\u043b\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Olan, Firith}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
