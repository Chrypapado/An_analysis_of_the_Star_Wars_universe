I guess it isn't so easy to be free&hellip;|Mary|Star Wars (1977) 89}}\n'''Mary''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] inhabitant of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Solay]], who served as the leader of the local resistance against [[King/Legends|King]] [[Blackart]], along with [[Raggold]]. In the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], arrived and intervened in their planetary affairs, helping Mary and her local resistance defeat the King. Blackart was arrested, and Mary became one of the leading figures of the short-lived provisional government. Mary proved, among other things, to be very lenient in her treatment of criminals, and was even willing to forgive King Blackart for his crimes.\n\nWhile working with Skywalker, Mary discovered she had fallen in love with him&hellip;a feeling that was also reciprocated by the young rebel. He entertained thoughts of leaving his position within the Rebel Alliance to stay with her and help her rebuild the government. Unfortunately, the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]], having received word of the successful uprising from the traitorous Raggold, arrived on Solay to retake control. Mary was killed in the initial firefight, causing Luke to tread dangerously close to the dark side. Realizing that an act of revenge would only sully Mary's memory, Luke's vengeful fury ceased, and he returned his efforts to helping the Rebel Alliance.\n\n==History==\n===Solay Rebel===\n{{Quote|He joined the rebellion as soon as he could walk, now must he die in the moment we win?! Why Luke, tell me, why?!|Mary|Star Wars (1977) 89}}\nIn [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Mary was on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Solay]], working as a member of a rebel group opposed to the tyrannical [[King/Legends|King]] [[Blackart]]. The group was led by the rebel, [[Raggold]], who had fought the Solay government for fifty years. By the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] was supporting King Blackart and his government against the rebels. However, following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], and the deaths of [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], the Imperial support for King Blackart was weakened. Seizing their opportunity, the Solay rebels planned a decisive strike on Blackart's throne room, hoping to kidnap the tyrant and end the long civil war. At the dawn of their attack, the Solay rebels were joined by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], an emissary from the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], who had defeated the Empire at Endor. Skywalker agreed to join the assault after meeting with Mary and Raggold. With Skywalker leading them, the Solay rebels easily defeated the [[Solay Royal Guard]] and stormed the throne room, capturing Blackart.<ref name=\"SW89\">[[Star Wars (1977) 89|''Star Wars'' (1977) 89]]</ref>\n\nHowever, at the moment of their victory, Raggold was struck by a single blaster bolt from an unknown source. The Rebel leader collapsed in the throne room, fatally wounded, and Mary rushed to her leader, cradling his body. As Raggold spoke his last words, he told both Mary and Skywalker that the person who had killed him was a traitor within their own ranks. Mary was devastated by Raggold's death, but when Skywalker wanted to search out the traitor, she vehemently disagreed. Mary told the young man that further violence would not honor Raggold's memory and she asked him to put aside his desire for revenge. Skywalker agreed to Mary's request and he helped her carry Raggold's dead body to King Blackart's throne, laying the dead rebel at the throne that he had long fought for.<ref name=\"SW89\" />\n\n===Solay leader===\n[[File:MaryStruck.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Mary is struck by blasterfire in the reconquest of Solay.]]\n{{Quote|Enough violence. It doesn't matter who killed who, we work for peace now, right? Besides Raggold said the traitor was within&hellip;from our own ranks. Raggold wanted rule by the many, not the few. So now everybody is king.|Mary|Star Wars (1977) 89}}\nThe victorious Solay rebels chained King Blackart up and stripped him of his crown. Although Skywalker wanted to interrogate Blackart about the death of Raggold, Mary demanded no further fighting, declaring to the rebels that Solay would now be ruled by the many and not by the few. Skywalker's desire for action was temporarily stifled by Mary's words, and he agreed to join in a celebration of their victory. As Mary and Skywalker walked among the Solay rebels, Mary stated her desire to use the planet's newfound freedom to restart the arts and allow the inhabitants the freedom to do and think whatever they wanted. However, Skywalker was not as optimistic as Mary, telling the young woman that they had a lot of work to do to make sure that Solay remained free. As Skywalker told Mary of plans to start a new government and root out the last remnants of King Blackart's rule, Mary stopped him, telling the rebel that those plans could wait, and they should be allowed to celebrate. Skywalker, enraptured by Mary's beauty and impressed by her bravery, agreed.<ref name=\"SW89\" /> Mary suggested that Skywalker be appointed as the representative of both the [[Alliance of Free Planets|Alliance]] and a new government on Solay.<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, Skywalker's fears proved true, as over a week later, the Solay rebels were still reveling in their victory, making no progress towards a new government. Although Skywalker brought up the need for further action to Mary, she was once again able to weaken his resolve. Mary had fallen in love with Skywalker during their time together, and she kissed the young man, who returned her affections. Despite Skywalker's protests, Mary convinced him to leave the party and get away from the other rebels for a few hours. Although Skywalker felt guilty about leaving the other rebels, his desire for Mary was strong, and he agreed to take a [[Starship/Legends|ship]] away from the place to be with her alone. Their plans set, Mary left Skywalker to arrange a ship for the two of them.<ref name=\"SW89\" />\n\n===Death===\n{{Quote|Luke&hellip;it's not over yet&hellip;the good always re-forms&hellip;hold on to the promise&hellip;of the way it could have been&hellip;what could have been&hellip;''\"<br />\"''No!

No!|Mary dies in Luke Skywalker's arms|Star Wars (1977) 89}}\n[[File:MaryDeath.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mary dies in Luke Skywalker's arms.]]\nHowever, as Mary departed, the party was interrupted by the arrival of a massive Imperial fleet. The Empire had come to put down the uprising, and the celebrating rebels were ill-prepared for another attack. As the rebels scattered, the Imperial ships began to fire on the crowd. Mary was caught out in the open, and a hail of blasterfire struck her in the back as she tried to make her way back to Skywalker. Mary collapsed to the street, mortally wounded as the fleeing crowd trampled her injured body. Skywalker was forced to watch as wild looters pulled jewelry from Mary's fallen body, tearing at her neck and arms. Using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Skywalker yelled at the crowd to get away from her, and he [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetically]] lifted her body to him. As Skywalker caught his injured love, Mary looked up at him, pained by her injuries and the loss of Solay's freedom. Although Skywalker willed her to hold on, Mary's injuries were too great, and she died in his arms.<ref name=\"SW89\" />\n\nSkywalker was greatly pained by Mary's death. With Mary no longer there to hold back his desire for revenge, the young rebel became determined to find Raggold's killer. However, Skywalker's search revealed that Raggold himself was the traitor. As a young man, Raggold had allied himself with the Empire to depose Blackart so that the Empire could take direct control over Solay. Upon his victory, he had committed suicide, wracked with guilt over the cost of his success, and knowing that the Empire would soon arrive to quash his rebellion. Skywalker was shocked by the revelation, realizing that in trying to track down the traitor that had caused Mary's death, he had trod dangerously close to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. Resolving to honor Mary's memory, Skywalker let go of his desire for revenge and left Solay in his [[Luke Skywalker's shuttle|ship]].<ref name=\"SW89\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|There can be no rest till the Empire's presence on this planet is crushed. And we must find that traitor&mdash;before he betrays us again.''\"<br />\"''Why? That killing was just a final desperate act. We've won! Luke, revenge is the wrong motive. But you know that.|Luke Skywalker and Mary|Star Wars (1977) 89}}\nAlthough Mary was a supporter of Raggold's rebellion and wished to depose the tyrannical King Blackart, she was a peaceful woman at heart and wished to see the end of violence on Solay. After Blackart had been defeated, she did not wish punishment against the tyrant, believing that too many lives had already been lost. In the aftermath of the civil war, Mary was optimistic for a new start for her world, hoping to revive the arts and allow the people freedom to do whatever they wanted. However, her naivety was challenged by Luke Skywalker who believed that maintaining freedom would be a hard-fought struggle.<ref name=\"SW89\" />\n\nAlthough Mary was a lenient leader after the deposing of King Blackart, her forgiving rule resulted in the rebels being unprepared when the Empire suddenly reappeared to subjugate the world. During her time with Luke Skywalker, Mary fell in love with him, and when she was attacked by the Empire, she called out to Skywalker, professing her love to him. Skywalker returned Mary's affections and was greatly affected by her death, coming dangerously close to the dark side when he attempted to track down her killer.<ref name=\"SW89\" /> In Mary, Skywalker believed that he had found a kindred spirit, someone who was noble and not afraid of dying for her cause. This fact compounded his guilt over her death.<ref name=\"CSL\">{{CollectorCite|7|ComicScan|ComicScan: Luke-ing for Love in all the Wrong Places}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMary was created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and illustrated by [[Bret Blevins]] for use in [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Star Wars (1977) 89|''Star Wars'' (1977) 89]].
