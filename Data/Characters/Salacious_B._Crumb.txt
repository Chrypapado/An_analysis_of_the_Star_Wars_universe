Crumb''' was a [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] who worked as a [[Jester (occupation)|jester]] in the court of the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Known for his shrill laughter, Crumb kept his master amused until his death during the [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue of]] [[Han Solo]] by members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender|male]] [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] from the [[planet]] [[Kowak]],<ref name=\"USW\" /> Salacious B. Crumb was known for his shrill, cackling<ref name=\"Databank\" /> laughter and sophisticated sense of humor like his fellow monkey-lizards. Many individuals of his [[species]] served as favored pets among denizens of the underworld, retaining their apparently hilarious-sounding names, and Crumb was no exception,<ref name=\"Kowakian Databank\">{{Databank|kowakian-monkey-lizard|Kowakian Monkey-Lizard|archivedate=20200218154734}}</ref> becoming the unofficial<ref name=\"Databank\" /> court [[Jester (occupation)|jester]] of the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. Crumb's association with Jabba began when the thief stowed away on the Hutt's [[starship]], and was found and captured by the [[Twi'lek]] [[Bib Fortuna]].<ref name=\"USW\" /> Jabba struck up a unique deal with the monkey-lizard: If Crumb could amuse Jabba at least once a [[Standard day|day]], he would be allowed to eat and drink as much as he pleased; if he failed, however, he would be [[Death|slain]]. Crumb lived in this manner for over a dozen [[standard year]]s,<ref name=\"Card Trader\" /> and henceforth sat beside Jabba to mercilessly tease and imitate captives, amusing his master greatly with his mimicry and laughter.<ref name=\"USW\" /> Crumb even imitated visitors, courtiers, and even Jabba himself, and used his position on the Hutt's dais to steal morsels of [[foodstuff|food]]. Jabba's noxious pet was tolerated because of the amusement he brought Jabba, and because of his unwavering support for his master.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nCrumb was present at Jabba's side when the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] arrived in [[Jabba's Palace]] to negotiate with the Hutt,<ref name=\"DV1\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref> and later accompanied his master aboard the [[sail barge]] ''[[Khetanna]]'' to celebrate with Vader. Crumb laughed uproariously as Jabba's gangsters fired at a [[herd]] of [[bantha]]s, causing Vader to threaten the creature's life should he laugh again in his presence.<ref name=\"SW4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Crumb_btm.png|thumb|left|Crumb in Jabba's Palace]]\nCrumb was present when members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] came to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] [[Han Solo]] from his boss' clutches. While they managed to free Solo they were quickly recaptured and Jabba took former [[Alderaan]] [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] as his [[Slavery|slave]]. After a failed negotiation [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] killed Jabba's pet [[rancor]] [[Pateesa]].  He accompanied his boss and his guests on the ill-fated ''Khetanna'' to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], where Jabba planned to execute some of the Rebels.<ref name=\"RotJ\" /> The foul gangster's effort at execution was quickly thwarted by the Rebels carefully laid plan.{{Fact}}\n\nWhen Skywalker managed to free himself and as the Rebels began fending off Jabba's Guards; general mayhem broke out on the sail barge. Leia cut off the lights of the barge, Jabba's guests, including Crumb, ran in search of an exit from the barge while Organa seized the moment to choke Jabba to death with her chain. Following Jabba's death, Crumb attacked [[C-3PO]], almost snatching one of his eyes, but R2-D2 went to the rescue of the [[droid]] and shocked Crumb, who turned away annoyed. Crumb was apparently killed when the ''Khetanna'' was destroyed by the Rebels, who then re-united and escaped.<ref name=\"Card Trader\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Salacious was a natural performer, and he was blessed with a panoply of physical features suitable for a crowd-pleasing clown: floppy ears, messy hair, wide-and-oh-so-hypnotic eyes, gangly limbs, clumsy movements, and an infectious cackle. But he didn't possess much of a brain between those outsize ears.|Lugubrious Mote|The Legends of Luke Skywalker}}\nA Kowakian monkey-lizard with a distinctive shrill cackle, Salacious Crumb usually sat on Jabba's lap, where he frequently stole food and mimicked, as the palace's unofficial jester, Jabba's courtiers, visitors and sometimes even Jabba himself. In fact, Salacious was just tolerated because his antics amused the Hutt and because of his unwavering support of his master.<ref name=\"Databank\" />He also loved tracking Jabba's tail move back and forth.<ref name=\"Salacious scarier\">{{SW|url=news/salacious-crumb-scarier|text=4 Reasons Salacious Crumb is Scarier Than You Might Think|archivedate=20211103130213}}</ref>\n\nSalacious was also known for his lack of respect, a trait which was demonstrated when the [[Sith Lord]] Darth Vader arrived to negotiate with the Hutt. Aboard Jabba's sail barge ''Khetanna'', he laughed uproariously as the Hutt's gangsters fired at a herd of banthas. The [[Sith]] [[Lord]] threatened the jester's life should he laugh again in his presence.<ref name=\"SW4\" />He would even sometimes mercilessly tease Jabba's captives and enjoyed watching Jabba torment others.<ref name=\"Salacious scarier\" />\n\nSalacious knew many individual's secrets and he was completely willing to use those secrets for his own personal gain or amusement. He had no moral code and was only loyal to Jabba.<ref name=\"Salacious scarier\" />\n\nAccording to the [[mole-flea]] [[Lugubrious Mote]], Salacious was not very intelligent. She described him as \"dumber than a newborn rancor.\"<ref name=\"Legends\">''[[The Legends of Luke Skywalker]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Wouldn't it be funny if there was a little tiny creature that sat on the shoulder of one of the creatures and repeated everything that the big creature said during the argument?|Ben Burtt's original idea for Salacious B. Crumb|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/much-to-learn-kowakian-monkey-lizards}}\nSalacious B. Crumb was voiced by [[Mark Dodson]] and controlled by puppeteer [[Tim Rose]], who also worked with the puppet of [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]], in the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. As seen in the [[1985]] documentary ''[[From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga]]'', Rose actually gave Crumb a voice (other than Crumb's laughing as seen in ''Return of the Jedi''), which he frequently used in conjunction with the puppet to joke around on set, but his voice was ultimately replaced with Dodson's. Salacious B. Crumb ended up being actor [[Anthony Daniels]]' favorite character of the series.<ref name=\"Making Jedi\">''[[The Making of Return of the Jedi]]''</ref>Sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] described Salacious' laugh as a \u201cfunny, hyena-like laugh.\u201d<ref name=\"Much to Learn\">{{SW|url=news/much-to-learn-kowakian-monkey-lizards|text=Much to Learn You Still Have: Kowakian Monkey-Lizards}}</ref>\n\nThe original idea for the character of Salacious came from Ben Burtt. He said it would be funny to have a small creature sitting on the shoulder of another creature and repeating everything the larger creature said during arguments.<ref name=\"Much to Learn\" />\n\nThe puppet for Salacious was created by [[Tony McVey]]. Its name was accidentally created by ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'' puppeteer [[Phil Tippett]]. George Lucas had given them the task of deciding the character's name. While trying to decide on a name, Tippett and his crew went out to lunch. They had drunken \"a few pitchers of beer,\" and on exit Tippett decided to bend down to tie his shoes. He said \"Wait a minute, guys, while I tie my soolacious,\" slurring the word \"Shoelaces.\" A crew member immediately recognized its potential. While [[George Lucas]] initially rejected the name for Jabba's jester, he changed it to Salacious and added the word \"Crumb\" for the character's surname as an homage to underground comic book artist [[Wikipedia: Robert Crumb|Robert Crumb]].<ref name=\"Making Jedi\" />\n\nAccording to [[Michael Carter]], the actor who played Jabba's [[majordomo]] Bib Fortuna, in a [[TheForce.net]] interview, during the filming of ''Jedi'', there were several scenes which involved [[Jess]] and Salacious B. Crumb, but these scenes, according to him, were cut from the final edit of the film.<ref name=\"TFNinterview\">{{Cite_web\n|url=http://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/mcarter.asp\n|title=TheForce.Net - Jedi Council - Interviews - Cellblock 1138 - Michael Carter\n|accessdate=23 August 2013\n|author=TheForce.net\n|last=\n|first=\n|authorlink=\n|coauthors=\n|date=\n|year=\n|month=\n|format=\n|work=\n|publisher=\n|pages=\n|language=\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217044710/http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/mcarter.asp\n|archivedate=17 February 2013\n}}</ref> However, some of these scenes appeared in the non-canonical ''[[\"Lapti Nek\": The Music Video from Jabba's Palace]]'' and in [[Warwick Davis]]' documentary ''[[Return of the Ewok]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|\n*[[The High Republic Adventures 7|''The High Republic Adventures'' 7]]\n*''[[5-Minute Star Wars Villain Stories]]''\n*[[Star Wars (2015) 15|''Star Wars'' (2015) 15]]\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|special=[[Star Wars Adventures Annual 2021|''Star Wars Adventures Annual'' 2021]]|story=[[The Hoojib Menace]]}} {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 4|''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle'' 4]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Original Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''\n*{{Shortstory|story=Added Muscle|book=From a Certain Point of View}} {{Imo}}\n*[[From a Certain Point of View (audiobook)|''From a Certain Point of View'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]\n*[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]\n*[[Star Wars (2015) 34|''Star Wars'' (2015) 34]]\n*[[Age of Rebellion - Jabba the Hutt 1|''Age of Rebellion - Jabba the Hutt'' 1]]\n*''[[Choose Your Destiny: An Escape Mission]]''\n*{{Galaxy of Adventures|Boba Fett - The Bounty Hunter}}\n*[[War of the Bounty Hunters &ndash; Jabba the Hutt 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters &ndash; Jabba the Hutt'' 1]]\n*[[War of the Bounty Hunters 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 1]]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''\n*[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!
