He was an opponent of [[Suudaa Nem'ro]], a member of the rival [[Nem'ro clan|Nem'ro]] [[Kajidic/Legends|clan]], seeking to take over Nem'ro's turf. Eventually, Fa'athra encountered the [[Imperial Agent]] [[Cipher Nine]] on [[Voss]]. Infuriated with the agent for driving him off Nal Hutta, he ordered his troops to attack Nine, but was killed instead. He was most often known simply by his ''[[cuirvas]]'', ''Fa'athra''.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn sometime after 3843 BBY, Fa'athra became an upstart member of the Hutt clans, specifically [[Fa'athra clan|clan Fa'athra]]. Instead of focusing on the slow accumulation of wealth and power, Fa'athra became a nimble strategist who enjoyed crushing his enemies with unstoppable force. Following the [[Treaty of Coruscant]] and the start of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], Fa'athra assassinated several Hutts in disfavor with the [[Hutt Cartel|Cartel]]. Eventually, he became an opponent to [[Suudaa Nem'ro]], hoping to take over his seat on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] from his base of operations in a [[Fa'athra's Palace|palace]] in the [[Eastern Grime]]. Since Fa'athra was less devoted to Hutt Cartel law, he considered himself a disciple of ancient Hutt traditions.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Fa'athra was engaged in a gang war with Nem'ro. However, he unknowingly was caught up in subterfuge committed by the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]], looking to acquire Nem'ro's allegiance. An Imperial agent, later known as [[Cipher Nine]], aided Nem'ro's cause by slaying [[Karrels Javis]], Nem'ro's lieutenant, and pinning the murder on Fa'athra, making it seem like he was aiding the Republic. The ruse worked, and Fa'athra was later forced off Hutta.\n\nAround [[3640 BBY]], Fa'athra was alerted by [[Hunter (Star Cabal)|Hunter]] of Nine's identity. Hiring a few mercenaries, Fa'athra journeyed to [[Voss]] to revenge himself upon the agent. His men kidnapped [[Bas-Ton (imposter)|Bas-Ton]], Nine's contact and an undercover Imperial agent. When the Cipher Agent came to him, Fa'athra and his troops engaged the Cipher Nine and were all defeated.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVoontara Fa'athra is a character in the 2011 game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''. The Hutt makes a personal appearance in the Imperial Agent's Chapter 3 story on [[Voss]].\n\nDepending on the player's choices, Fa'athra's fate may be decided three ways:\n*The Agent spares Fa'athra and acquire his services (neutral dialogue)\n*The Agent tells Fa'athra to forget his grudge and the Hutt leaves peacefully (light-side dialogue)\n*The Agent executes Fa'athra (dark-side dialogue)\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance]]'' {{1stm|''The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance'' audiobook}}\n*[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki|Fa'athra the Hutt|Voontara Fa'athra}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fa'athra\n|it=Voontara Fa'athra\n|ru=\u0412\u0443\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0424\u0430'\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fa'athra, Voontara}}\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Fa'athra gang members]]\n[[Category:Hutt Cartel individuals]]\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
