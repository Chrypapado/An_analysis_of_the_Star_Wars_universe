I'm the unofficial champion of the Pazaak circuit here on Taris. If you don't mind losing your wager we could play a few hands.|Niklos|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Niklos''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who frequented the [[Upper City Cantina]] on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] during the time of the [[Jedi Civil War]], claiming to be the \"unofficial champion of the [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] circuit on Taris.\" He used to have frequent games with fellow player [[Gelrood]], until the latter was banned from the Upper Cantina on suspicion of cheating.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|If you ever wish to test yourself against the best Pazaak player on Taris, heh, you know where to find me.|Niklos|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nNiklos was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]] who resided on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He was a patron of the [[Upper City Cantina]], where he spent his [[Time/Legends|time]] playing [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]]. He used to play against fellow player [[Gelrood]], until the latter was banned from the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] on suspicion of cheating. Following this, Niklos was unable to find a rival who could match his skill in the game.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nIn [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"CG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> Former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] and redeemed Jedi [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who was on Taris in search of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Bastila Shan]], visited the Upper City Cantina and bought a pazaak deck from the retired player [[Garouk]].\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I'm going to enjoy relieving you of your credits almost as much as I'm going to enjoy humiliating you.|Niklos, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nNiklos wasn't nearly as fine a pazaak player as he stated; he would often blame his failure on his opponent cheating, which he did to both Revan and Gelrood. Once he decided someone was a cheater, he would call them that at every opportunity; he would also refuse to play against them under any circumstance.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|I do not lose at Pazaak very often, but you have made a habit of beating me. I think it is obvious what that means&mdash;you cheat!|Niklos, after losing to Revan several times|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIf the player beats Niklos in pazaak 5 times in a row without losing, he will eventually accuse the player of cheating and will refuse to play pazaak anymore. If [[Mission Vao]] is with you she will comment on his accusation of the player cheating calling him a sore loser. Another pazaak player in [[Javyar's Cantina]] named [[Gelrood]] got banned from the Upper City Cantina due to cheating despite denying these claims, it is possible Niklos got Gelrood banned from the cantina due to getting beaten by him multiple times.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Niklos\n|es=Niklos\n|nl=Niklos\n|pl=Niklos\n|fi=Niklos\n|ru=\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u0441\n}}\n\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
