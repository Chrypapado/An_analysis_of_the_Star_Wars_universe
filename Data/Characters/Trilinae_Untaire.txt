During the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Untaire joined the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and became a friend of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Darrus Jeht/Legends|Darrus Jeht]]. At some point during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Jeht was sent a number of crates containing the parts of an ancient [[Starship/Legends|starship]], and he and Untaire investigated the deliveries in an attempt to find out who was sending the crates. However, despite her efforts, Untaire was unable to trace the cargo manifests of the shipments. Jeht eventually assembled the starship and at Untaire's suggestion, he named the completed vessel the [[Legacy (Darrus Jeht)|''Legacy'']]. Around this time, Jeht obtained tickets to a performance of the band [[Sien'Soro]] and he planned to take Untaire and the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] Jedi [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]] to the concert with him.\n\nFollowing the declaration of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], the [[Advanced Recon Commando/Legends|ARC trooper]] [[Mar'ek]] marooned Untaire on a remote world against her will, to keep her safe during the upheaval. However, Mar'ek later lied to Darrus Jeht and claimed that he had [[Death/Legends|killed]] Untaire, so as to prevent Jeht from having the satisfaction of knowing that his friend was still alive.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20041028|text=Priorities|int=Priorities|archivedate=20091015233258}} {{1st}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20041216|text=Standoffs|int=Standoffs|archivedate=20090603045521}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20060216DarkShadows|text=Living Force: Dark Shadows|int=Living Force: Dark Shadows|archivedate=20090603045518}} {{Mo}} {{1stID}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20060302OneMinute|text=Living Force: One Minute to Midnight|int=Living Force: One Minute to Midnight|archivedate=20090603045513}} {{Mo}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20070201LastStand|text=Living Force: Last Stand|int=Living Force: Last Stand|archivedate=20091016011748}} {{Mo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Untaire, Trilinae}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi]]"}}}]}}}}
