Every kid does, but with the blood of a scoundrel and a princess in his veins, his defiance will shake the stars.|Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Aftermath: Empire's End}}\n'''Ben Solo''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Force-sensitive]] who fell to the [[dark side of the Force]] as '''Kylo Ren''', [[Master of the Knights of Ren|master]] of the [[Knights of Ren]] and eventual [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]], but returned to the [[Light side of the Force|light side]] shortly before his [[death]]. He was [[Reproduction|born]] at the [[Galactic Concordance|end]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]] in [[5 ABY]], when the [[Galactic Empire]] [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|surrendered]] to the [[New Republic]]. His [[parent]]s, [[General]] [[Han Solo]] and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], were considered great heroes of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], as was his maternal uncle, [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. The heir to the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker bloodline]], Ben Solo possessed raw strength in [[the Force]] and had the potential for limitless power. During the [[New Republic Era]], Solo was part of a [[Jedi Order|new generation]] of [[Padawan|Jedi apprentices]] [[Jedi training|trained]] by his uncle. He was seduced by the dark side through the machinations of the phantom [[Dark Lord of the Sith]], [[Darth Sidious]], and his [[Strand-Cast|creation]], Supreme Leader [[Snoke]]. [[Rey's father|Sidious's son]] had a [[Palpatine family|daughter]], [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], who was born to her [[Rey's mother|mother]] in [[15 ABY]]. Unknown to any at the [[time]], Solo and Rey were counterparts as a [[Force dyad|dyad in the Force]].\n\nIn [[28 ABY]], a confrontation initiated by Skywalker led Solo to embrace the dark side; he [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed]] his master's [[Jedi Temple of Luke Skywalker|training temple]] and killed his fellow students before he fled to join Snoke as the renamed Kylo Ren. As a product of [[Jedi]] and [[Sith]] teachings, Ren embodied the conflict between the dark side and the light but was dangerously unstable. Inspired by the legacy of his grandfather, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], Ren sought to [[Great Jedi Purge|destroy the last remnants]] of the Jedi Order and and conquer [[the galaxy]]. Determined to sever all ties to his past, Ren [[Battle of Starkiller Base|killed his father]], [[Battle of Oetchi|assassinated his master]], and conquered vast regions of the [[galaxy]] as the new Supreme Leader. The Jedi apprentice Rey had briefly grown close to Ren through their unique [[Force-bond]] and believed she could turn him back to the light, but she rejected his offer to rule with him and joined the [[Resistance]] led by Leia Organa while continuing her Jedi training.\n\nIn the last [[Standard day|days]] of the [[First Order-Resistance War]] in [[35 ABY]], [[Darth]] Sidious offered the [[Final Order]] [[fleet]] to Ren in return for killing his sworn enemy, Rey. Ren attempted to betray Sidious, but Rey again rejected his offer. Despite Ren's aspiration to rule the galaxy as the new [[Galactic Emperor]] and Dark Lord of the Sith, he was pulled back to the light during a [[Mission to Kef Bir|duel]] with Rey when his mother communicated with him as she died, reminding him of his family's love and forgiveness. Rey turned back from her own brush with the dark side to save his life by [[Force healing|healing]] the wound she had given him. Reclaiming his identity as Ben Solo, the redeemed Jedi joined Rey on [[Exegol]] to [[Battle of Exegol|defeat]] Sidious, though the effort took Rey's life.

A warrior calling himself \"[[Ren]]\" spoke on the group's behalf, declaring that the outpost and its contents were claimed by the [[Knights of Ren]]. Rejecting the Knights' claim, Skywalker drew his [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|green-bladed lightsaber]] and introduced himself as the last Jedi, and therefore, the heir to all that belonged to the Order.

While training on the [[Jedi Temple of Luke Skywalker|temple]] grounds, Voe watched as Solo levitated a large rock with ease, and wondered why he was far stronger than her. According to Skywalker, however, strength had nothing to do with how the Force worked. He likened using the Force to opening a door, explaining that the Force flowed more easily through those who were open to its energy. Notwithstanding Skywalker's view on the Force, Solo surpassed his peers in every aspect of their training, including [[lightsaber combat]] and [[meditation]].<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 3\" />\n\n[[File:All Too Easy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Solo found a rival within Voe, a fellow student, during his time at Skywalker's Jedi temple.]]\nHis relationships with the other students were different. Hennix could make Solo laugh, and Tai tried to help him cope with the pressures of being a Skywalker.

Solo listened, but said nothing while Tai expressed his belief that everyone should be themselves.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 3\" /> In Voe, despite being friends, Solo found a rival to push himself against during their training, Voe trying to surpass and beat her fellow Jedi at nearly everything within their training.<ref name=\"Skywalker: A Family at War\" /> At one point, he defeated Voe in a sparring match.

Just as Organa expected, upon becoming aware of the truth across the [[HoloNet]], Solo was shocked; the revelation felt like a betrayal for him and crushed the image he had of Anakin Skywalker by realizing that his parents and uncle never shared the turth with him despite knowing it for decades, leaving him to discover the Skywalker family's most carefully guarded secret along with the rest of the galaxy.

He went to his nephew's bedroom one evening to confront him, and found him asleep. Standing over his sleeping student, Skywalker reached out and sensed that Solo had already turned through Snoke's influence, and saw the death and destruction Solo would someday bring to everything Skywalker loved. The immediacy and severity of the threat caused the Jedi Master to instinctively draw his lightsaber, intending for a brief moment to kill his apprentice to prevent his vision from coming to pass, but the impulse vanished in an instant. Skywalker was immediately filled with shame and saw Solo had awakened to see his uncle standing over him with his lightsaber raised. Solo, unaware of the brevity of Skywalker's instinct, witnessed it long enough to fear for his life and realized what his uncle had seen in his mind. He panicked and drew his own lightsaber to strike his uncle first, but Skywalker quickly blocked his nephew's killing blow.

Solo dejectedly informed them about Skywalker's actions and responded angrily when he assumed Voe was questioning his power in comparison to their master's. Solo told them the temple was a lie that was now over. As Solo turned to leave, the apprentices brandished their lightsabers at him, causing Solo to fight back with his [[Force power]]s, injuring Hennix. Defeating them, he boarded his starship [[Grimtaash (starship)|''Grimtaash'']], whilst the trio followed in their own spacecraft, the ''[[Verity]]''.

Snoke not only supported Solo's new path, but also encouraged the fallen Jedi to take the opportunity of forging his own identity absent of Skywalker's influence. Solo had long felt the pressure of living up to the legends he was named after, and therefore wished to be rid of his given name as well as his father's surname. Even before he departed to search for the Knights of Ren, Solo began entertaining the idea of using a name he coined as a child. Snoke approved, believing that the new name represented Solo's true nature and would become known to the entire galaxy one day. Returning to the place where he last saw the Knights, Solo made contact with Ren by using the latter's [[helmet]] as a direct line of communication, and was told to seek them out on [[Varnak]] in the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]].

Sensing Tai's mental probe, Solo telekinetically pushed Tai against a wall before leaping high into the air, his temper rising at the students who pursued him in spite of his warnings back at the temple. He implored them to let him go, but Voe continued to give chase. She accused him of betraying the Jedi and their master, but it was her accusation of murder that pushed Solo past the limit of his patience.

However, Hennix saw the exchange and believed that he had just witnessed Solo in the act of killing a fellow Jedi. Before this, he attempted to reason with both Solo and Voe, calling their battle irrational and even \"stupid.\" In his misunderstanding, however, Hennix called Solo a monster and threw his lightsaber at Solo, not realizing that the latter was struggling to keep Voe from falling to her death. The attack caught Solo by surprise, causing him to drop Voe as he instinctively deflected Hennix's blade before refocusing his attention on saving Voe. Though she ultimately survived due to the efforts of Solo and Tai, Hennix was cut down by his own blade, Solo having inadvertently caused it to ricochet in the direction of its wielder. When Voe and Tai asked what happened to Hennix, Solo told them it didn't matter. Before Voe and Tai could recover, Solo seized them both with the Force and threw them back into the outpost.

Knowing that Snoke had sent Solo to them, Ren informed the young Jedi that he would have to offer them a sacrifice before he could join their ranks. As with Snoke, Ren was doubtful that Skywalker died by Solo's hand, although Solo confirmed that at this point he was responsible for the destruction of the temple and deaths of other Jedi. Ren, however, needed to know if the Jedi that Solo killed held any significance to him, so he asked Solo to recount the details of his confrontation with Tai, Hennix and Voe. As Solo began telling his story, his thoughts drifted to years past when he was younger&mdash;a child surrounded by other young students whom Skywalker had taken under his wing.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 3\" />\n\nSolo recounted his experiences with the three Jedi who followed him to Elphrona, beginning with Voe. He remembered how she treated everything between them as a competition, throughout their time together as Skywalker's apprentices. For Solo, however, nothing with Voe was a contest as he outperformed her in every aspect of their training, despite all of Voe's attempts to reach the level of Solo's skill. Through Solo's recollection of her, Ren deduced that Voe was focused on his strength, whereas Hennix concentrated more on solving the mysteries of the Force as though it were a puzzle. Solo remembered Hennix for his humor and intelligence, but was more cryptic about Tai. Though Solo would not speak of him in detail to Ren, he remembered the way Tai encouraged him to be himself despite the pressure of being who he was&mdash;the scion of a legendary family.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 3\" />\n\nHaving learned enough about the other students of Skywalker, Ren directed Solo to return to the more recent past regarding his confrontation with the trio that pursued him in the wake of the temple's destruction. Solo took responsibility for Hennix's death, telling Ren that he killed his fellow Jedi. Ren, however, remained skeptical as were the other Knights. Solo protested, believing he met their qualifications, and although Ren agreed that Hennix was technically a death caused by Solo, he knew that the young fallen Jedi was conflicted about it. Nevertheless, Ren allowed Solo to accompany the Knights, at least for the time being, given that he was strong with the dark side as well as the fact that Snoke had already vouched for him. Ren also suspected that, in the course of Solo's journey with the Knights, the former Jedi would eventually make a sacrifice that was worthy of the Knights of Ren.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 3\" />\n\n[[File:KyloRenBetaTestVersion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Though conflicted over his choices, Solo's descent into darkness continued as he began traveling with the Knights of Ren.]]\nAs far as Ren was concerned, Solo's appearance as a Jedi made him unsuitable to be seen in the company of the Knights.

Though he had direct access to the Supreme Leader and could command [[First Order military|military]] officers, he existed outside of the official military command structure. This led to some tension with the First Order's upper ranks, who contended with him despite being wary that his agenda trumped military objectives. This arrangement deliberately mirrored the Galactic Empire's relationship with Darth Vader, who existed outside of the formal military hierarchy but could nonetheless command the [[Imperial Military]] in his own objectives. This tension was particularly palpable with General [[Armitage Hux]], the commander of [[Starkiller Base]], the First Order [[superweapon]] capable of destroying entire [[star system]]s. Ren, who was part of an unofficial Starkiller Base command triumvirate with Hux and [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] of the First Order military, had little regard for Hux as a warrior; Hux's military experience was mostly theoretical and based on simulated but nonetheless respected battlefield scenarios.

Ren commented that he could still sense his uncle from his time on Dagobah training with [[Yoda]]. Snoke nodded and told Ren that one of the most formidable Jedi began his training here. Ren then asked Snoke why he spoke of Skywalker with respect. Snoke said that Skywalker had earned his respect and fear. Ren told Snoke that Skywalker was weak. Snoke replied that Skywalker was not weak, merely misguided. If Snoke had had Skywalker by his side, the galaxy would have belonged to him a lot earlier. They then went to the cave, from which Ren could sense a coldness radiating, along with death and other things. Snoke explained that was where all the fears Ren had been too weak to bury resided. He could go in or run away. But Ren's mind was already made up. He ventured in.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Snoke\" />\n\nOnce inside, Ren had a vision of his uncle Luke, saying that he didn't want to fight Ren. Ren told him that he did not care and activated his lightsaber. Snoke sensed the decision Ren had made and told him that it was good and that Skywalker would have murdered him in his sleep because he feared Ren and how formidable he'd become. As the two dueled, Snoke advised Ren to use his hatred, rise above what was holding him back, and strike against the light within him. Ren did so and impaled the vision of Luke. Thinking he was finished, Ren told Snoke that he was done. But Snoke told him that the vision had just started.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Snoke\" />\n\n[[File:Ben_Solo_and_parents.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Despite his anger and rage, Ben Solo could not bring himself to strike down the apparitions of his parents, Han Solo and Leia Organa.]]\nRen then caught sight of his parents, begging him to quit his actions. He tried to kill the light within him by saying that Ben wasn't his name, but Leia insisted it was and that he was loved. Outside the cave, Snoke could sense the conflict within Ren, but then he sensed Ren ignite his lightsaber. He told Ren to kill the connection and snuff it out. But, in the cave, Ren hadn't killed his parents; instead, he used his lightsaber to slice a tree. This action proved that though he hated his uncle, he loved his mother and father, and it foreshadowed what he would do to Snoke, who couldn't sense that he had not killed the vision of his parents. Ren then destroyed the Cave of Evil, surprising Snoke, who told Ren that the cave had stood for thousands of years and that he had planned to bring other apprentices there. Ren answered by telling Snoke that the past was the past and that Snoke would no longer need any more apprentices.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Snoke\" />\n\n====Colonization of the Unknown Regions====\n{{Quote|They also said that someone called ''Kylo Ren'' was leading the First Order army.

On Supreme Leader Snoke's instruction, the new military undertook a major offensive against several of these kingdoms to seize their worlds and resources to fuel their rise.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nAt some point, Ren led an army to the world of [[Tehar]], where they subjugated the local population by [[Massacre on Tehar|massacring]] a village. However, the siblings [[Kel]] and [[Eila]] survived the destruction of their village and fled Tehar after stowing away on a cargo ship. Since the children bore the knowledge of its aggressive actions against the people on Tehar, the First Order [[Hunt for Eila and Kel|placed]] a large bounty of twenty thousand credits on their heads, telling informants that Kel and Eila were members of a high-ranking First Order family from outside its military hierarchy.<ref name=\"The Children from Tehar\">{{Resistance|The Children from Tehar}}</ref>\n\nKel and Eila eventually made their way to [[Castilon]] and sought refuge on a [[supertanker fuel depot]] known as the ''[[Colossus]]''. After meeting the Resistance [[spy]] [[Kazuda Xiono]], Eila told him about Ren's involvement in the raid on her village. Though she knew little about the warrior dressed in black, apart from his name and affiliation with the army that invaded Tehar, Ren's lightsaber reminded Eila of the legends about the Jedi who carried the same weapons. Xiono, who was also unaware of Ren's identity, passed this information to the Resistance while reporting to [[Ello Asty]].<ref name=\"The Children from Tehar\" />\n\n===The search for Skywalker===\n====Hunting the last Jedi====\n{{Quote|If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.|Snoke|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\nBoth Ren and the Supreme Leader understood that if Skywalker and the Jedi were to ever return, they would be a grave threat to the future of the First Order. The people who were closest to Skywalker believed he had gone in search of the first Jedi temple, the location of which had been lost. A partial map was recovered from the archives of the Galactic Empire, but it was missing a key piece of the puzzle. The First Order soon discovered that the missing map fragment was in the possession of Lor San Tekka,<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> a member of the [[Church of the Force]].<ref name=\"TFA VD\" />\n\n====Mission to Pillio====\n{{Quote|Tell me where Lor San Tekka took the map.''\"<br />\"''&hellip;Bayora.

Although San Tekka was not found on the world, the First Order's allies captured and detained [[Del Meeko]], a veteran of the Galactic Civil War who served the Empire and New Republic, in turn, as a member of [[Inferno Squad]]. Upon his arrival, the dark warrior was greeted by [[Protectorate (title)|Protectorate]] [[Gleb]] of [[Jinata Security]]. Dismissive of the formalities, he instructed the [[Aqualish]] [[officer]] to lead him to Meeko. He found the former soldier wounded and alone on the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of the [[Raider II-class corvette|''Raider II''-class corvette]] [[Corvus (Raider II-class)|''Corvus'']].<ref name=\"Battlefront II\">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>\n\nIgnoring the prisoner's sarcasm, Ren used the Force to [[Mind probe (Force power)|probe]] through Meeko's [[Brain|mind]], determined to learn where San Tekka took the map. For all of Meeko's efforts to resist the probe, invading his mind was a relatively simple task for Ren, who saw memories ranging across the former [[commando]]'s life&mdash;from his service on [[Scarif]] as a [[coastal defender stormtrooper]] to his participation in the Battle of Endor and the [[Skirmish on Vardos|skirmish]] on [[Vardos]]. He also learned that Meeko encountered Skywalker on Pillio and subsequently discovered his faith in the Force. Ultimately, Meeko was unable to resist Ren's powers and revealed that San Tekka took the map with him to [[Bayora]].<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\nHaving gained the information he sought, Ren turned the prisoner over to [[First Order officer]] [[Gideon Hask]], one of Meeko's former teammates in the Inferno Squad prior the Empire's fall, who executed Meeko shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n====GUHL-JO387O====\n{{Quote|General Hux&hellip; I know where we must go&hellip; and I know this is the key.

They were discussing travel to a planet in the [[Western Reaches]]. While in the conference, [[Unidentified creature (GUHL-JO387O)|the creature]] that the stormtrooper, [[Finn|FN-2187]], was chasing turned off the lights, interrupting the conference. Ren, his temper under control, felt something nearby: something from the planet that should not be on board. He activated his lightsaber to illuminate the room and looked around, but whatever it was had now gone.<ref name=\"Pest Control\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=3|story=[[Pest Control]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conference, Ren transmitted orders to Phasma via private frequency. But he had to make sure she got them, so he walked over to the captain's quarters and called her from outside. Only Phasma's helmet appeared through the opened doors. Pleased by her punctuality, Ren relayed what he sensed to Phasma, for he planned to have a discreet search throughout the ''Finalizer''. He ordered her to take a [[squad]] of trainees to investigate the planet for any Resistance activity. Anything Phasma may find, she must deliver to Ren.

Their shuttle was consequently destroyed and the pilot died in the crash, although Ren survived the incident by protecting himself with the Force. By saving himself, however, he inadvertently saved Hux's life as well. The destruction of their vessel along with its communications system left them marooned and unable to contact the First Order. Realizing that a [[Unidentified radar technician|saboteur]] was responsible for their predicament, the two rivals began bickering over which of them was at fault. Ren chided Hux as he believed the general was targeted by a conspirator in his own army, to which Hux responded by mocking Ren for his temper and efforts emulate Darth Vader. Ren drew his lightsaber at the mention of his parents and contemplated ridding himself of Hux once and for all, aware that it would be some time before the First Order located their position. However, Hux reminded him of the one person who would learn the truth: Ren's master, Supreme Leader Snoke. Although he did not understand why Hux was important to Snoke's plans, Ren conceded the point that there would be a penalty for killing the Supreme Leader's favored general, and therefore deactivated his lightsaber, sparing Hux.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Hux\">[[Age of Resistance - General Hux 1|''Age of Resistance - General Hux'' 1]]</ref>\n\nFollowing their argument, Ren and Hux were attacked by a [[norwood]], a large creature native to the planet that they were stranded on. Drawing his lightsaber once more, Ren took a defensive stance and told Hux to stay behind him, only to see that the general had already fled in the opposite direction of the beast. Though abandoned by Hux, Ren stood his ground and managed to incapacitate the norwood by using the Force to smack its head against a tree. Believing himself victorious, Ren called Hux a coward and told him to come out from wherever he was hiding, but a second norwood ambushed him and ultimately rendered the dark warrior unconscious, at which point the Alderaanian exile [[Bylsma (Alderaanian)|Bylsma]] emerged and prevented the norwoods from killing Ren.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Hux\" />\n\n[[File:Saved_By_The_Force.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ren used his powers to survive the crash, inadvertently saving Hux in the process.]]\nHux, who had been hiding in the trees and watching as the event occurred, cautiously approached Bylsma from his hiding place. Recognizing the old man's uniform, Hux came to the conclusion that Bylsma was an Alderaanian [[Alderaan guard|palace guard]]. Bylsma confirmed as much and revealed that he had fled into exile after the destruction of Alderaan. He stranded himself on a distant planet and severed his connections to the larger galaxy, fearing that his new home would suffer Alderaan's fate if he attempted to use his ship's communications, but as a result, Bylsma had no knowledge of the events that unfolded after the disaster. Hux used Bylsma's ignorance of recent galactic history in order to gain his trust. In addition, he used Ren's heritage to his advantage, informing Bylsma that the man whom the norwoods attacked was, in fact, a fellow son of Alderaan. More to the point, he was the son of Leia Organa, the princess of Alderaan. Bylsma, who had known both the princess and her adoptive father, saw the physical resemblance between Ren and his mother and wondered if Ren was anything like the princess he once served. Hux assured him that Ren was indeed like his mother, even if he would have denied it.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Hux\" />\n\nBylsma built a stretcher and carried Ren to his home, where Hux convinced the retired soldier to give him access to the ship's communications so that they could be rescued. After regaining consciousness, Ren played along with Hux's deception until a shuttle arrived to retrieve them. The shuttle ramp lowered revealing Captain Phasma and a squad of stormtroopers, leading to the norwoods' immediate death by blaster fire. Ren boarded the shuttle in silence alongside Hux, who told the captain to spare the old man's life but to disable his communications array, leaving Bylsma truly stranded and alone. They reported directly to Snoke via hologram after their return to Starkiller Base; although Ren offered to punish the culprit responsible for sabotaging the shuttle, Hux insisted on handling the matter personally, given that the conspiracy was directed at him. Snoke approved the general's request, causing Ren to question the Supreme Leader's faith in Hux. Ren, who could sense Hux's ambition to kill and replace Snoke, and therefore, deemed him untrustworthy, was certain that his master knew it as well. Snoke dismissed Ren's concerns, however, and explained why Hux&mdash;a vicious and unforgiving man, consumed by ambition and driven by spite, molded as such through years of abuse&mdash;was ultimately a useful asset.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Hux\" />\n\n===Walking in Darth Vader's shadow===\n====Confronting old enemies of Vader====\n{{Quote|But still, we are walking in Darth Vader's shadow.

Ren, who was aware that his grandfather once [[Battle against the Benathy|fought]] against the Benathy decades earlier during the reign of the Galactic Empire, saw his mission as an opportunity to succeed where Darth Vader failed&mdash;by forcing the Benathy to submit to the First Order. Captain [[Ruthford]], a veteran [[Stormtrooper|Imperial stormtrooper]] who joined the First Order, accompanied Ren as his military [[advisor]]. Having served with Ren's grandfather against the Benathy, Ruthford opined that Vader managed to subdue the aliens but at the cost of thousands on both sides, resulting in a pyrrhic victory. But where Ruthford was disillusioned by his past experience with the Benathy, believing their conflict with the Empire was pointless and a waste of lives, Ren saw only glory as he walked across the field of battle where Vader once stood, the shadow of his grandfather's legacy looming over him.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Kylo\">[[Age of Resistance - Kylo Ren 1|''Age of Resistance - Kylo Ren'' 1]]</ref>\n\nDespite the army behind him, the First Order's troops were ordered to stand by while Ren conducted negotiations with the Benathy's ruler, [[King]] [[Kristoff]], attempting to secure their capitulation without bloodshed. Desiring to expand the Benathy's domain, Kristoff not only conquered four nearby planets but also had them purged of all life, leading Ren to demand that the Benathy cease their expansion immediately. Compared to Ren, the late Vader commanded the king's respect, but only to a degree because while Vader killed [[Unidentified Benathy king|Kristoff's predecessor]] he failed to defeat their [[Zillo Beast]], which the Benathy worshiped as a god. Nevertheless, Ren continued his efforts to resolve their situation through diplomacy and even attempted to dominate the king's will by way of the Force. The [[mind trick]] failed, however. Kristoff openly mocked Ren's negotiating skills, causing Ruthford to caution him against provoking the dark warrior. At that point, Ren stabbed the king through the head with his lightsaber, concluding negotiations in favor of open [[Battle against the Benathy (First Order)|battle]].<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Kylo\" />\n\n[[File:Kneel_Before_Ren.jpg|thumb|right|250px|With the death of their Zillo Beast god, the Benathy bent the knee to Kylo Ren and the First Order.]]\nLeading by example like his grandfather before him, Ren fought alongside his stormtroopers as they engaged the Benathy and personally killed numerous enemy combatants until their deity arrived. Despite Ruthford's skepticism, Ren was undaunted and ordered his men to keep fighting. After their initial efforts to kill the beast failed, he improvised a plan to kill the creature to the dismay of Ruthford, who could no longer restrain himself from expressing his disapproval of Ren's desire to match Vader's achievements. In his view, there was no competition between Ren and Vader because the latter was long since dead.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Kylo\" />\n\nDespite the captain's lack of faith in him, Ren commanded a shuttle to bring him to the jaws of the Zillo Beast, diving head-first into its mouth. Convinced that Ren was dead, Ruthford was in the middle of recommending the option of retreat to a nearby admiral when the Zillo Beast suddenly collapsed and died. Ren had killed the creature from within, where it was vulnerable, and managed to cut his way out, emerging from its corpse covered in the blood of the Benathy's deity. Declaring that their god was now dead, the dark warrior commanded the Benathy to submit to the First Order, and they did by kneeling in submission to him. In the end, he not only gained the allegiance of the Benathy, but also Captain Ruthford's respect.<ref name=\"Age of Resistance Kylo\" />\n\n====Raid on Jakku====\n{{Quote|The map to Skywalker.

Ren, who knew San Tekka from childhood as the explorer was once an old ally of Organa and Skywalker, brought the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'' in his search for the map. The First Order's military attacked the village of [[Tuanul]], where San Tekka lived. Once the [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|First Order stormtroopers]], under the command of Phasma, rounded up the denizens of the village, Ren arrived on the battlefield and confronted San Tekka, lamenting how old the former explorer had become, to which San Tekka replied that Ren's fall to the dark side was far worse. Ren demanded that San Tekka give the map to the First Order, but San Tekka refused to submit to the will of the dark side and reminded the one-time Jedi that Ren could not deny the truth of his heritage, at which point Ren struck him down with his lightsaber while sarcastically agreeing with him.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nMoments later, he was shot at from afar by [[Commander]] [[Poe Dameron]], a [[Resistance Starfighter Corps|starfighter]] pilot in the Resistance who was sent to Jakku by General Organa to find the map before the First Order. Ren used the Force to [[Force Stasis|freeze]] the blaster bolt midair, and Dameron was soon brought before him. The dark warrior realized that Tekka gave the map to Dameron and ordered that the [[trooper]]s bring the pilot onto Ren's [[Kylo Ren's command shuttle|command shuttle]], before giving the order to kill the rest of the villagers. One stormtrooper, FN-2187, hesitated and ultimately chose not to fire on the civilians, an act that Ren noticed as he could sense his fear before boarding his shuttle.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n====Locating BB-8====\n{{Quote|The droid&hellip; stole a freighter?|Kylo Ren, to Dopheld Mitaka|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\n[[File:Kylo_tortures_Poe_Dameron.png|thumb|right|269px|Ren used the Force to extract the location of the map from Poe Dameron's mind.]]\nDameron was [[Prison|brought]] aboard the ''Finalizer'' for interrogation, where he was placed into an [[Torture|interrogation]] [[Interrogation chair|chair]].<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> The device, used by Ren to extract information from his prisoners, was based on similar devices once used by the [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] of the Galactic Empire.<ref name=\"TFA VD\" /> First Order interrogators were unable to break Dameron, but they did learn that he was the best pilot in the Resistance, a feat that Ren noted once he began interrogating the pilot personally. Though the dark knight was impressed that Dameron had not yet been broken, Ren began to use the Force to mentally extract the information from Dameron's mind. The pilot, who resisted the Force attack, finally was forced to reveal that he had hidden the map inside his [[BB-series astromech droid|BB unit]], [[BB-8]], who was likely still on Jakku. Ren informed General Hux of the new development and left the recovery of the droid in the hands of the military.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nShortly after leaving Dameron under the guard of several stormtroopers, Ren arrived on the ''Finalizer''{{'s}} bridge upon hearing that the Resistance pilot [[Escape from the Finalizer|escaped]] aboard a [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE fighter]]. Hux confirmed this with the additional information of Dameron having had help from someone within the First Order's ranks. Ren realized that it could only have been FN-2187, after remembering how the conflicted soldier had hesitated in Tuanul, and he said as much to Hux. The TIE fighter was eventually shot down after a brief skirmish, and it crash-landed on Jakku.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[File:Phasma_Hux_Ren.png|thumb|left|250px|Dameron escaped with the help of FN-2187, causing Ren to doubt the loyalty of Hux's stormtroopers.]]\nThe First Order recognized that Dameron and the deserter designated FN-2187 were looking for the droid, so Hux ordered a [[squadron]] to be sent to Jakku to recover it first. Hux soon spoke to the Supreme Leader, who ordered them to capture the droid if they could, but destroy it if they must. Ren questioned the capability of Hux's soldiers and training methods, wondering aloud whether the Supreme Leader would be better off using an army of [[Cloning|clones]]<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> as the [[Galactic Republic]]<ref name=\"Episode II\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> and the early Empire had once done.<ref name=\"Episode III\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Hux told him that they were more than capable, and warned Ren not to let his personal mission to find Skywalker interfere with the Supreme Leader's orders.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nLater that day,<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> a nervous [[Lieutenant]] [[Dopheld Mitaka]]<ref name=\"TFA VD\" /> informed Ren that the [[astromech droid]] escaped aboard a [[YT-1300 light freighter]]. At first, Ren found it unlikely for a single droid to be capable of stealing a ship but allowed Mitaka to continue. Further intelligence suggested the probability of FN-2187, who had now branded himself with the name Finn, abetting the droid's evacuation from Jakku. Enraged that the [[Treason|traitor]] had robbed him of the means to find Skywalker, Ren ignited his lightsaber and destroyed the [[computer]] terminal in front of him. The dark warrior calmed down, asking if there was \"anything else.\" Mitaka replied that the defector and the droid had help from a [[Rey Skywalker|girl]].

Once there, Ren and Hux spoke to Supreme Leader Snoke, who communicated to his subordinates via an enlarged [[hologram]]. Snoke remained concerned that Skywalker's return would be a threat to the First Order, so Hux proposed that they finally use the weapon as intended and destroy the New Republic one and for all. Without the Republic, Hux knew that the Resistance would be vulnerable and could be stopped before they found Skywalker.

Before the First Order departed, General Hux unleashed the Starkiller weapon against the Republic. After giving a speech to his forces about the end of a regime that he believed could not contain galactic chaos, Hux ordered that the weapon be fired. Ren watched from the bridge of the ''Finalizer''<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> as the weapon's [[phantom energy]]<ref name=\"TFA novel\" /> left the surface of Starkiller Base and made their way<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> to the Republic's [[capital]] of [[Hosnian Prime]],<ref name=\"TFA VD\" /> where they [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroyed]] the entire [[Hosnian system]].<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[File:ReyRen-TFAintltrailer.png|thumb|right|250px|Ren discovered Rey on Takodana and took her prisoner once he realized she had seen the map to Skywalker.]]\nWith the Republic severely damaged, Ren led his forces to Takodana, where the stormtroopers [[Battle of Takodana|attacked]] Kanata's castle.

When Rey and the astromech tried to escape through the forest, they split up as she led the stormtroopers away from the droid. Ren soon arrived on the battlefield and found her in the woods.

Finally, Ren froze her in place with a [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] attack.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nUsing the Force to enter Rey's mind, Ren saw that she had seen the map he sought. Believing the First Order would not need the droid since he could view Rey's memories, he used the Force to render her unconscious and captured her. He ordered the First Order to retreat and their forces left Takodana. The droid ultimately made it out of the forests and into the hands of the Resistance.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[File:Mind_Probe_SWDA.png|thumb|left|250px|Ren probed Rey's mind for the map to Skywalker and sensed her loneliness in the process.]]\nRen brought Rey to Starkiller Base via his command shuttle and restrained her in an interrogation chair. When she awoke, she asked where her friends were, and Ren told her he had no idea. He sensed she still wanted to kill him, and she said it was because she was being hunted by a creature in a mask. He removed his mask to show his young face and asked about the droid, but the girl only gave him BB-8's technical specifications. Ren told her that he knew about the map and that the First Order had recovered the rest of it from the archives of the Empire.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nRen warned Rey that he could take whatever he wanted from her before probing her mind with the Force while she resisted his mental attack.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> At the time, Ren was unaware that he and Rey formed a [[Unidentified Sith Eternal prophecy|prophesized]] [[Force dyad|dyad in the Force]], but he sensed they had an innate connection.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> In her mind, he discovered her name,<ref name=\"TFA novel\" /> felt her loneliness and fear, and saw an [[ocean]] and an island that she had dreamed about during her life as a [[scavenger]] in the [[Starship Graveyard|junkyards]]. When he sensed Han Solo, Ren could tell that Rey looked at the smuggler as a father figure, but he said that Solo would have only disappointed her. Rey grew more resistant to his mental attack and turned it against him, using the  same ability to see that Ren was afraid he would never be as strong as Darth Vader was.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n====Snoke's new strategy====\n{{Quote|Supreme Leader, I can get the map from the girl.

Ren told Snoke that Rey was even stronger with the Force than she realized. The Supreme Leader asked what happened to the droid, and General Hux, who had just entered the chamber, told Snoke that Ren believed he only needed Rey and allowed the droid to escape. Concerned that the Resistance might have the full map to Skywalker, Snoke ordered Hux to unleash the Starkiller weapon against the [[Resistance base]] on the planet [[D'Qar]]. Ren swore that he could still find the map in Rey's mind as long as he had his master's guidance, so the Supreme Leader ordered Rey to be brought to him.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nOn his way to Rey's holding cell, Ren learned that the girl had somehow broken out. The guard who had been ordered to watch her could not fathom how he ended up in his quarters. When asked by a First Order officer if \"stronger methods\" were needed, Ren declined; any further simple questioning might enable the guard to remember something important. In the meantime, Rey must be found.<ref name=\"TFA novel\" />\n\nWhen Ren returned to the cell,<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> he needed to see if Rey had truly used her emerging Force abilities to escape.

[[Unidentified female First Order stormtrooper|A trooper]] reported sensor readings in [[Hangar 718]], which meant Rey could be there. But investigations turned up nothing. Nonetheless, Ren wanted every hangar on lockdown to prevent Rey from commandeering a ship. Right in the middle of that order, he was interrupted by a familiar presence: Han Solo. His father was on Starkiller Base.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nRen ordered for a search of the ''Millennium Falcon'', for the ship had shortly been sighted at the edge of a cliff. By the time he arrived on the scene, everything checked clear and not a single hidden trap could be found. He boarded the ''Falcon'' and sat on the pilot's seat, looking for anything that may lead him to Solo's whereabouts. Just then, he spotted Resistance [[T-70 X-wing starfighter|X-wings]] flying past and [[Battle of Starkiller Base|assaulting]] the [[thermal oscillator]],<ref name=\"TFA novel\" /> hoping to destroy it and set off a chain reaction that would cause the planet to implode before the weapon could destroy D'Qar. Ren rushed to the oscillator, commanding his troops to find the intruders.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> He knew Solo had to be nearby,<ref name=\"TFA novel\" /> as well as the fact that he did not come alone.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nAs Ren advanced on the walkway, he stopped upon hearing the voice of his father, calling out to him from behind, using his birth name. He turned about face and said he had been waiting for this eventuality. Solo told him to remove the mask so he could see the face of his son once more. Ren removed the mask but told Solo that he had destroyed Ben, who Ren thought was weak and foolish, much like his father before him. Solo refused to acknowledge Ren's pessimistic stance on the matter, retorting that his son was very much alive and Snoke was simply using Ren for his power, and that once Snoke had exhausted Ren's usefulness, he would be disposed of. Ren, while neither denying nor confirming what Solo said about Snoke to be true, stated that it was too late for him. Solo pleaded with Ren to come home to his true family, claiming that he and Organa desperately missed the presence of their son. Ren, conflicted by the pull towards the light, broke down in tears and told his father that he was being torn apart by the constant struggle between the dark and the light inside him and wanted to be free of the pain that he was feeling. He knew what he had to do to put a permanent end to his inner turmoil, although Ren was uncertain whether or not he could perform the necessary act to do so. Asking for his father's assistance in ceasing the struggle, Solo agreed, not knowing that it was the light that Ren felt conflicted by.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[File:Kylo_impales_Solo.png|thumb|right|264px|Ren committed patricide, believing it would end the war within, but his father's death left him more conflicted than ever.]]\nRen, who was being watched from afar by Chewbacca, Rey, and Finn, took out his lightsaber and Solo grabbed hold of it. As the Starkiller finished draining the [[star]] it orbited to power the weapon, and the light on the planet died out, Ren ignited his lightsaber and impaled his father through the torso. A mortally wounded Han Solo touched his son's face one last time before falling to his death in the bowels of the oscillator.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Despite Ren's role in his death, Han died refusing to believe that his son was lost to the dark side forever.<ref name=\"Skywalker: A Family at War\" />\n\nThe act of patricide had an unsettling effect on Ren, as did Solo's gesture of compassion which tormented Ren far more than killing his own father.<ref name=\"Skywalker: A Family at War\" /> Rather than make him stronger in the dark side, as he had thought, it had weakened his spirit.<ref name=\"TFA novel\" /> He became unbalanced,<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> and was more miserable and weak than before.<ref name=\"Skywalker: A Family at War\" /> The shock had been so profound, he did not register Chewbacca's roar of anguish<ref name=\"TFA novel\" /> nor Rey's scream of horror.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nEnraged by the loss of his best friend, Chewbacca fired a powerful shot from his Wookiee [[bowcaster]] and hit Ren in the left side, seriously injuring the dark knight.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Quickly, Ren used the Force to reduce the effects of the wound, lest it may result in his premature death.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> Chewbacca killed several other stormtroopers in the area as Rey and Finn, who were high above in the oscillator, began firing into the area as well. The Wookiee then ignited charges that he and Solo set throughout the oscillator, causing a massive explosion that breached the oscillator and gave Dameron and the remaining Resistance pilots an opportunity to destroy it. As Ren composed himself from his injury, he made [[eye]] contact with Finn and Rey. Anger swelling within him, he was resolved to find them before they could escape.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n====Duel in the forest====\n{{Quote|We're not done yet.''\"<br />\"''You're a monster!''\"<br />\"''It's just us now.

He confronted them, lightsaber drawn, and said that they still had unfinished business from which Han Solo could not save them. Outraged by Ren's patricidal actions, Rey denounced the dark warrior as a monster and tried to attack him with her blaster, but he used the Force to throw her into a tree and knock her unconscious. Now it was just Ren and the traitor who had earned his ire.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nFinn ignited the [[Skywalker lightsaber]] that had been given to him for safekeeping by Maz Kanata&mdash;a lightsaber that once belonged to Luke Skywalker, and to Anakin before him. Ren demanded that Finn give him the lightsaber, claiming it belonged to him, but instead the former stormtrooper engaged him in a lightsaber duel. It was a short but brutal contest, in which Ren kept striking his bowcaster injury in order to fuel his anger and power. In the end, Finn, who nonetheless landed one blow on Ren's right shoulder, was no match for Ren's power. Ren overwhelmed and disarmed his opponent, ending the fight with a punch and a lightsaber blow across Finn's back that left the one-time stormtrooper comatose.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nWith the duel seemingly over, Ren turned his attention towards his grandfather's lightsaber and attempted to use the Force to draw it into his hand. Instead, it flew past him and landed in the hands of Rey, who used the Force to call it to her&mdash;as it was her destiny to wield the lightsaber of Anakin Skywalker. Rey ignited the weapon and engaged Ren in a tense duel. At first, Ren had the upper hand, remaining on the offensive as he pressed his attack against the retreating scavenger. Their blades became locked, and Ren told the emerging Force-sensitive that she needed a teacher. It was he, Ren said, who could show her the ways of the Force. At that moment, Rey realized she could call upon the powers of the Force and began using that to her advantage. She turned the tide of the fight and pushed her own offensive against the dark warrior, who she was finally able to disarm. In doing so, she slashed her blade across his face, knocking him down and disfiguring him in the process.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[File:Rey_vs_Kylo_Ren.png|thumb|right|250px|Although Ren initially had the upper hand, Rey defeated him by embracing the power of the Force.]]\nBefore they could engage any further, the surface of the planet began to break apart&mdash;the Resistance was victorious, and the destruction of the oscillator triggered the Starkiller's implosion. Ren and Rey were separated by a deep chasm, so Rey left the dark warrior behind, recovered Finn, and fled the planet with Chewbacca aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nAs the planet continued to collapse, Snoke ordered General Hux to find Ren and bring the young knight before the Supreme Leader so the young warrior's training could be completed.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Hux and several troopers tracked Ren's signal and took him aboard a shuttle, leaving before the planet exploded.<ref name=\"TFA junior novel\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Immediately following Starkiller Base's destruction, Ren received treatment for the long scars on his body, though it was too late to erase them completely.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" />\n\n===Let the past die===\n====A child in a mask====\n{{Quote|Yes.

The warship ''Supremacy'' led the charge, its powerful [[turbolaser]]s showering the fleet with unyielding blasts. To complement the [[Battle of Oetchi|barrage]], the ''Supremacy'' scrambled its short-distance fighters, with Ren spearheading the assault in his [[Kylo Ren's TIE silencer|personal TIE silencer]]. Covered by [[Kylo Ren's personal squadron|three wingmen]], until the third pilot was quickly destroyed, the dark apprentice intercepted the Resistance's [[MC85 Star Cruiser]] [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']], capital ship of the fleet. Before the rebel pilots could launch a counterattack, he destroyed the ''Raddus'' hangar, leaving them unable to resist the fighter wing.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nWith the Resistance flagship crippled, Ren turned his fighter to face the bridge of the craft, readying his rockets. At this moment he sensed his mother's presence aboard the ''Raddus'' (with his mother likewise sensing him too) and Ren, hesitating, held his thumb over the trigger in a moment of intense doubt. After a moment, he surrendered to his second thoughts and abandoned the trigger control. His [[Poldin LeHuse|wingmen]], however, had no such qualms&mdash;ever loyal to the First Order, they launched their rockets in Ren's place upon the bridge.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nRen watched the detonation with astonishment.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> He reached out again, but could not feel Organa anywhere.

Before he knew it, a vision of Rey appeared before him. Taken aback, Ren could only watch as Rey reached for her blaster and shot him. However, no shot injured him. The still-shocked Ren pursued Rey when she ran away and found her soon after and tried to use the mind trick to force Rey to bring Luke to him, only to realize that they weren't actually in the same location and that Rey had not [[Force projection|projected]] her appearance to him as the effort would kill her. He even discovered that Rey had found Luke Skywalker and was now studying under him, although he could not discern where as he was unable to see Rey's surroundings.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Whereas the aspiring Jedi regarded their [[Force-bond|connection]] as an inconvenience, Ren was intrigued by his bond with the former scavenger and sought to better understand it.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nThe bond between Ren and Rey was unprecedented in its strength and raw power.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> It also had an effect on Ren's churning emotions,<ref name=\"Kylo Ren Bio Gallery\" /> and as it grew stronger in the Force, Rey started gaining new insights into Ren, who,<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> to Rey's surprise, no longer tried to hide his feelings of pain and misery from her.<ref name=\"Rey Bio Gallery\">{{Databank|rey-biography-gallery|Rey Biography Gallery|archivedate=20200109232354}}</ref> It was because of the bond and her new understanding of Ren's pain that Rey came to suspect that their destinies were intertwined.<ref name=\"Rey\">{{Databank|rey|Rey|archivedate=20200607022628}}</ref> Ren eventually revealed his recollection of the night he forsook Skywalker's teachings&mdash;how he awoke to the sound of a lightsaber, held by his uncle who intended to murder Ben Solo in his sleep&mdash;shaking Rey's faith in her Jedi Master.

Rey then beheld a vision of the future, leading her to believe that Ren was fated to renounce the dark side and return to the light,<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> like his grandfather before him.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\nAs a result of what she saw, Rey became convinced that her adversary could be turned from the dark side of the Force. She left Skywalker on his sanctuary and traveled to the ''Supremacy'' to see Ren, her actions guided by the belief that Ben Solo could be redeemed with her help. By touching hands, however, Ren experienced a vision of his own and thereby discerned the truth of Rey's father and mother: they were no one, merely a pair of junk traders who sold their daughter for drinking money before ultimately dying and being buried in a pauper's grave in the Jakku desert.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> This discovery convinced Ren that Rey would turn to the dark side and stand with him as they moved to confront his master together.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\n====Destiny fulfilled====\n{{Quote|My worthy apprentice, son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader.

Clinging to the good she sensed within Ren, she reached out to the former Ben Solo and revealed her conviction in the vision she had when they touched hands through the Force. Solo was not fated to continue bowing before Snoke. Redemption was his destiny; of that Rey was certain. Ren, however, revealed that he also beheld a vision that convinced him it would be Rey who turned, because he now knew the truth behind Rey's parentage. Just before they entered the throne room where the Supreme Leader awaited their arrival, Rey sensed that much of Ren's churning emotions were about her.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nSnoke, who proclaimed that his faith in Ren had been restored, began appraising Rey, who remained defiant in spite of her inability to resist the dark master's Force powers. Although Rey remained certain that Ren would turn, her mental defenses began to crumble when Snoke revealed that he had been responsible for the intermittent connections she experienced with the Supreme Leader's apprentice, a revelation which came as a shock to Ren as well. It had all been a plot to draw Rey, the means to find Luke Skywalker, right into Snoke's hands. Nevertheless, Ren remained silent as Rey screamed,<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> trying in vain to stop Snoke from invading her mind.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\n[[File:Death_of_the_Supreme_Leader.png|thumb|left|258px|Ren accomplished what his grandfather could not: killing and usurping the dark master as ruler of the galaxy.]]\nUpon discovering Skywalker's location, Snoke planned to wipe him out from above as soon as the more immediate enemy had been dealt with. Rey summoned Skywalker's lightsaber to her hand, only for Snoke to redirect the hilt onto her head; Ren, eyes shut, merely tilted his head to the right to avoid being struck by the flying object. The Supreme Leader revealed through his [[Oculus (device)|oculus]] the Resistance being picked off one by one as they tried to flee aboard [[U-55 orbital loadlifter|transports]] for safety. All that Ren's mother had fought for would be destroyed by the ''Supremacy''{{'s}} guns. In response, an enraged Rey pulled Ren's lightsaber into her hands and charged at Snoke, who effortlessly overpowered her. Ren watched the lightsaber fall out of Rey's grip and shut off, sliding on the floor back to its owner's feet.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nSnoke, who had grown weary of his oft-conflicted apprentice, exulted at the newfound resolve that he suddenly felt emanating from Ren. Having promised to kill Rey with the cruelest stroke, he immobilized Rey and gave Ren the chance to execute the girl who defeated him on Starkiller Base. Ren retrieved his lightsaber, stood up and stepped towards Rey.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> He knew what must be done<ref name=\"Kylo Ren Bio Gallery\" /> and, as Rey predicted, he did indeed turn against his master.<ref name=\"Rey Bio Gallery\" /> Knowing that Snoke could sense his every intent, he turned his lightsaber to Rey while simultaneously his uncle's weapon rotated to face in Snoke's direction. Snoke, who became distracted by the desire to appreciate Rey's impending doom with the Force rather than the approximation afforded by mundane senses, believed that Ren was about to kill his true enemy&mdash;a status he wrongly attributed to Rey.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n[[File:ReyKyloVsGuards.png|thumb|right|269px|Ren and Rey stood back-to-back against the Supreme Leader's vengeful Praetorian Guards.]]\nWith a hidden gesture from Ren's free hand, the blue energy blade of Skywalker's lightsaber sprang forth, spearing Snoke through his waist. Almost instantly, Snoke's control on Rey was lost. The blade, which was still under Ren's control, carved through Snoke, cutting him in half before returning to Rey's grasp. After a moment of locking eyes with each other, Ren and Rey stood back-to-back to receive the retaliation of the fallen Supreme Leader's [[Elite Praetorian Guard]]s, who charged towards the Force-sensitive duo from all sides with the intent of avenging his death. Although the two were eventually separated and forced to contend with multiple guards on their own, they both held their own and continued to strike down one Praetorian after another. Ren, who felt both excitement and a hunger for battle, personally killed half the Guards on his own but was disarmed by his fifth opponent, causing Rey to throw the Skywalker lightsaber to him. He swiftly thumbed it on and off, letting the blade pierce through the last Praetorian's head.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n====Convictions and rejections====\n{{Quote|It's time to let old things die.

It would be a relatively straightforward operation, with Ren's forces marching on an [[Crait outpost|abandoned rebel base]] which the Resistance had appropriated for its defense.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nWhen the First Order discovered a massive shield door impeding their advance into the enclosure, Ren further deployed a [[superlaser siege cannon]]&mdash;a device likened to a battering ram that was equipped with miniaturized [[Death Star]] technology&mdash;to his advantage. In response, the Resistance launched a number of old [[V-4X-D ski speeder|ski speeders]], an ultimately futile attempt to stop the cannon. While the Resistance attempted to halt the First Order's progress, Chewbacca and Rey joined the fray in the ''Millennium Falcon'', and Ren furiously sent every TIE fighter present to destroy his father's old ship.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n====Showdown with Luke Skywalker====\n{{Quote|I'll destroy her, and you, and all of it.''\"<br/>\"''No. Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. Just like your father.|Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}\n[[File:Family_Reunion.png|thumb|right|262px|Ren challenged his uncle Luke Skywalker to single combat, intending to finish what Darth Vader began by killing the last Jedi.]]\nShortly after the First Order breached the base, Luke Skywalker appeared and Ren, in a futile attempt to eliminate his uncle, ordered all of his forces to fire at him. After Skywalker shrugged off the attack virtually unharmed, Ren ordered his command shuttle to be set down. Hux tried to advise him against what he considered a waste of time, but Ren thrashed the General against the wall with the Force, knocking him unconscious. The nearby pilot needed no further prodding and complied with the command.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nThe time had come for Ren to face Skywalker personally. He slowly advanced until he was but a few meters from the old Jedi. He tauntingly asked if Skywalker had come to be his salvation. Skywalker answered half-heartedly in the negative. Then lightsabers were drawn. Skywalker made no effort to harm his nephew and only moved to avoid Ren's attacks. He apologized for failing in his duty as Ben Solo's mentor, but Ren took it with sarcasm and declared that the war had ended with the death of the Resistance. In addition, he stated that Skywalker would die as well, marking the end of the Jedi Order itself. He was wrong on all counts, according to Skywalker: the war had just begun, the Rebellion was reborn, and he would not die as the last of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nRen felt that Skywalker was talking about Rey, the old man's supposed \"Chosen One.\"<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> He vowed that he would see her annihilated, along with Skywalker and the remnants of the Resistance. In response, Skywalker deactivated his lightsaber. He warned his nephew against striking him down in anger; otherwise, Skywalker would always be with Ren, just like Han Solo. It was thus that he opened himself up for the final blow.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nRen charged at Skywalker once more until he slashed through him with no effect. Confused, he pointed his lightsaber in the Jedi Master's direction and moved forward until the blade harmlessly passed through his uncle again, revealing that Skywalker was not actually present for the battle; he had been [[Force projection|projecting himself]] through the Force from Ahch-To. With one final chiding goodbye, the image vanished.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n[[File:Kylo_Ren_looking_at_Rey.png|thumb|left|260px|Rey chose to shut Ren out when the Force reconnected them, leaving the Supreme Leader alone and unable to revel in his achievements.]]\nAt that moment, Ren realized what had his uncle had done: by distracting him, the old Jedi had bought time for the remaining members of the Resistance to escape. Hux had been right all along. Angered by the deception, Ren, Hux and their forces scoured the now-empty base, but finding only a projection of his father's golden hanging dice, all Ren could do was kneel in defeat as they vanished from his hand. As the Resistance evacuated, Ren saw Rey once more as she boarded the ''Millennium Falcon''; no words were said as she closed the door on him,<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> although Ren sensed that Rey felt neither hatred nor compassion for him.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> Both knew that this struggle between them was far from concluded.<ref name=\"TLJ Adaptation 6\">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 6|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 6]]</ref> Ren had become the Supreme Leader, all but destroyed his mother's Resistance and struck down his uncle on the battlefield of Crait, but it did not feel like a victory to Ren.<ref name=\"Kylo Ren Bio Gallery\" />\n\nAfter Crait, Rey and Organa discussed Ren and his actions. Rey wanted to understand him and how Ren had turned to the dark side, but Organa told Rey that she would need to ask Ren to know. Rey told the general that Ren wanted her to join him and that, while she thought she could help him, all he had wanted was for her to be like him. Organa could see that Rey cared about her son and also that he had disappointed her, so she informed the young Jedi that Ren had made his decisions, adding that the only person who could save him was himself, but Organa was unsure if that was what her son wanted. Rey understood this, but she had held onto hope, although Organa believed that hope was a good trait.<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\">''[[Resistance Reborn]]''</ref>\n\n====Campaign of terror====\n{{Quote|We can and will chase every rumor, every scrap, every vapor trail across the galaxy!

Immersed in the dark side of the Force, Ren instituted a zero-tolerance policy against \"subversive\" worlds, directing his forces to hunt and destroy all dissidents who opposed his reign as the new Supreme Leader. Ren also kept his involvement in Snoke's death a secret, so that no one would doubt his claim to the leadership of the First Order.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" />\n\nAlthough General Hux survived the regime change within the First Order, the new Supreme Leader was distrustful and refused to lower his guard around someone as devious as Hux. Ren ensured that his one-time rival would have little independent authority without supervision, giving assignments to [[Allegiant General]] [[Enric Pryde]] or even to the Knights of Ren before entrusting Hux with anything of importance. The years that Hux spent jockeying for power against Ren ultimately worked against the general, his authority being superseded not only by Ren, but Pryde as well.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> At some point during the war, Ren sought an update on the Order's stock of refueling stations, leading to a short notice meeting aboard the ''[[Titan]]'' that Hux attended. Prior to the meeting, Hux mentioned Ren seeking an update to Stormtrooper Commander [[Pyre]].<ref name=\"Station to Station\">{{Resistance|Station to Station}}</ref> Ren also kept Hux close by to countermand the general's orders when necessary; on one occasion, Hux dismissed a reported sighting of the Resistance operative Finn, believing it was a waste of the First Order's resources to follow up on every rumor regarding the Resistance. This led Ren to openly chastise Hux on the bridge of the ''Finalizer'', ensuring the general understood that they would use every available asset to find and destroy the Resistance.<ref name=\"Allegiance 1\">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Leader made good on his vow to punish any world that showed anything less than absolute loyalty. Making his way to the neutral planet of [[Fondor]], Ren placed it under military occupation after learning that the Resistance had passed through its system. Although an [[Unidentified human male (Fondor)|official]] of Fondor swore that his government held no allegiance to the insurgents, having refused to assist them in any capacity, the mere contact with the enemies of the First Order provided Ren with his justification for seizing control of the [[Fondor Shipyards]]. Convinced the Old Empire had been too lenient, Ren adopted a zero-tolerance policy in regard to the Resistance, and as such, he personally decapitated the official. Ultimately, Fondor was made an example to the rest of the galaxy, warning them to stay away from the Resistance on pain of death. Such measures were intended by Ren to prevent the Resistance from replacing their lost resources.<ref name=\"Allegiance 2\">[[Allegiance 2|''Allegiance'' 2]]</ref>\n\n====Consolidation of power====\n{{Quote|The First Order is on the verge of bringing unprecedented peace to the galaxy.

Before Ren could strike Moradi down, Rey arrived, and the two Force-sensitives began a lightsaber duel. However, Ren was ultimately forced to leave when a stormtrooper informed him of an incident aboard their destroyer. <ref name=\"Kylo vs Rey Galaxy's Edge\">{{Youtube|video=UGUsYWmVV2I|text=Star Wars Lightsaber Battle and Stunt Show in Galaxy's Edge during media event &#124; Attractions Magazine|channel=Attractions Magazine|channelname=Attractions Magazine|archiveurl=https://archive.is/dlLEi}}</ref>\n\nRen was in command of the ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer that [[Battle of Batuu|captured]] a Resistance [[Intersystem Transport Ship]]. However, Poe Dameron managed to escape before returning with a sizeable fleet that caught the First Order off guard. Ren, who commanded the First Order forces alongside General Hux, realized that the Resistance was using a hijacked [[First Order Fleet Transport]] and eventually engaged in a pursuit.

He also transferred his command to Pryde's Star Destroyer [[Steadfast (Resurgent-class)|''Steadfast'']], bringing Hux with him after their old flagship, the ''Finalizer'', sustained significant damage from the run-in with Resistance forces over Batuu.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" />\n\nAs Supreme Leader, Ren formed a regime that was different from the one overseen by his predecessor. He sought to foster cooperation among the top First Order military leaders, and as such Ren formed the [[Supreme Council]], a cabinet consisting of members of High Command, such as Allegiant General Pryde, General Hux, Admiral [[Frantis Griss]], and generals [[Amret Engell]], [[Bellava Parnadee]], and [[Domaric Quinn]]. They were all proud men and women who were unaccustomed to Ren's leadership, having risen through the ranks in a time when most high-ranking officers knew little of the First Order's goals and capabilities. Despite Ren's motivation for creating the Council, their meetings aboard the ''Steadfast'' became marred by sniping and turf wars.<ref name=\"Supreme Council DB\">{{Databank|first-order-supreme-council|First Order Supreme Council|archivedate=20200313031426}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kylo-Stormtroopers.png|thumb|left|250px|Conquered worlds were subjected to the absolute rule of the First Order and its new Supreme Leader.]]\nThe First Order's military might cowed many worlds into submission,<ref name=\"Episode IX\" /> although some remained defiant despite the threat of annihilation. Ren, who now saw himself as ruler of the galaxy, toured the worlds that the First Order conquered in the name of their new Supreme Leader. [[Unidentified world (Kylo Ren)|One of the worlds]] that he visited was under military occupation; the officer who greeted him expressed how honored they were by his presence while [[Unidentified First Order officer (Kylo Ren)|another]] prepared his speech to the local population, which included metaphors and allusions of cultural relevance to the world that they occupied. As he stood on a balcony overlooking the crowd, he crushed the [[datapad]] containing his speech, which was followed by the stormtroopers saluting with their left arms extended into the air with a closed fist.

This time, however, he was ambushed by a group of insurgents hiding within the crowd. Ren ordered his stormtroopers to stand their ground and fought beside them. During the battle, he targeted the [[Unidentified woman (Kylo Ren)|woman]] who led the insurgents, determined to make her an example to others who defied his authority as the Supreme Leader. He ceased his attack, however, wishing to know her motives for defying him in spite of the consequences. The woman declared that her people would rather die fighting for freedom than submit to Ren's [[Fascism|fascist]] rule. Ren's response was that he would make her people suffer for her actions, but the woman asserted that their sacrifice would not be in vain if it inspired further resistance against the First Order. Ren dismissed her as a fool, and said that she would regret her choice.

While the [[Ace Squadron]] intensified their attack run on the [[Thunderer|main Star Destroyer]], Tierny received a transmission from Supreme Leader Ren.

He said that he did not want to have to kill her, but he would find her and turn her to the dark side. Before their connection ended, he ripped the [[husk necklace]] from her neck which physically transported it from Rey's location to Ren's hand.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\nRen informed Pryde that he had found Rey through the Force, and [[intelligence officer]] [[Tishra Kandia]] returned with her analysis of the necklace; it was made in the [[Middian system]], specifically the Forbidden Valley.

Ren sifted through Chewbacca's memories of both Han and Ben Solo, including \"Uncle Chewie\" teaching young Ben to shoot a blaster and fly a speeder. Though Ren discovered the information he sought, he struggled to center his thoughts after the interrogation was complete.

Ren rejected Hux's proposal to destroy the city as Ren wanted Rey captured alive. The local [[Kijimi garrison|First Order garrison]] unsuccessfully searched for Rey's team. Unknown to Ren, the arrival of the ''Steadfast'' at Kijimi allowed Rey to sense Ren's conflicted mind and realize that Chewbacca was still alive. Her team infiltrated the ''Steadfast'' to rescue him.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" /> Ren arrived in Kijimi City afterward, and overcome by frustration, he used his lightsaber to destroy several inanimate objects before ordering a lockdown on the city.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\n[[File:Force-bond_battle.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The bond between Ren and Rey was stronger than ever before, allowing them to exist within each other's minds and spaces.]]\nAfter Rey entered Ren's quarters, she touched the [[Blade of Ochi of Bestoon]] which triggered memories of her parents.

Ren revealed that Sidious was her [[Palpatine family|paternal grandfather]]; she had inherited Sidious' power, just as Ren was the heir to the Skywalker bloodline as Vader's grandson. Ren had also discovered that he and Rey were a dyad, two who were one in the Force, and he had concealed this from the Emperor. Together, he believed, they had the power to destroy Sidious and seize his throne.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\nRey considered leaping into the abyss despite how far the planet was beneath them.

While en route to the system, Sidious contacted Ren through the Force.

Sidious threatened to turn his fleet against Ren if he did not kill Rey. While mentally shielding his true intentions,<ref name=\"TROS EE\" /> Ren assured Sidious that he knew where Rey had gone and declared that he would not allow her to become a Jedi.

He stood on the wreckage of the battle station while thinking of the voices in his mind and how they convinced him that his family never loved him. He also thought of his old master, Supreme Leader Snoke, who conditioned Ren to believe what the voices said to him. However, as a result of his mother's effort to reach him at the cost of her life, Ren found himself questioning everything he had been led to believe about the dark side, his family, and himself. In addition, he tried to understand Rey's reason for healing him.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nHis deep contemplation gave way to the memory of his late father, Han Solo, who manifested before Ren as a vision. Though the voices in his mind convinced Ren that it was too late for repentance, the vision of Han told him that he missed his son and it was not too late to fight for his mother's legacy. Ren was overcome by the emotions drawn out of him by his father's memory, and though he still questioned his resolve, uncertain if he was strong enough to do what he believed needed to be done, his father reassured him that he was strong.

Sensing Rey's presence emanating from the Sith Citadel, he sprinted for the monolith and descended to the lower levels to find her. Armed only with a blaster and his own conviction, Solo charged through the cavernous cathedral beneath the citadel, shooting his way through the Sith cultists and [[Sovereign Protector|elite guards]] who obstructed his path. As he drew closer to the [[Sith Citadel throne room|throne room]], the Knights of Ren appeared before him. Their hatred pulsated like waves through the Force, and Solo realized that they had traveled to Exegol to fight for Sidious, their true master.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\n[[File:Ben-and-Rey-on-Exegol.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Standing together as a true dyad, Ben Solo and Rey confronted the clone remnant of Darth Sidious.]]\nThe six Force-sensitive warriors initially held the upper hand, as their numbers, weapons and training worked to their advantage against their former leader. Solo sustained blunt force trauma to his abdomen and the back of his skull, being hit several times by his opponents' melee weapons. The Knights refrained from killing him outright, as they were confident in their ability to defeat a single opponent who appeared defenseless before them. They circled for another attack, but to their surprise, Solo revealed a blue-bladed lightsaber in his palm. It was the lightsaber that once belonged to his grandfather and uncle, in turn, and had been carried by Rey until she passed it to Solo through their bond as a dyad. He instantly recognized it as his lightsaber, as it had become an extension of his own self.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nThinking of what his father would say in this moment,<ref name=\"TROS EE\" /> Solo simply shrugged his shoulders at the Knights, knowing now that the odds were in his favor.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" /> Armed with the blade of the Chosen One himself, Solo immediately pressed the attack with all the focus of a Jedi,<ref name=\"TROS Junior Novel\" /> killing Cardo and Kuruk with a single swing of the saber to their masked faces.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" /> Simultaneously, Rey ignited her spare weapon, [[Leia's lightsaber|Leia Organa's lightsaber]], as several of the Emperor's guards surrounded her. As before on Pasaana and Kijimi, Solo and Rey were separate and together at the same time, with Rey battling the crimson-robed guards and Solo confronting his former comrades. This time, however, they were drawing on each other for strength, becoming even more powerful as one instead of two.

They turned towards the Emperor, standing side-by-side with their lightsabers raised, to which Sidious exclaimed that they would die together. Despite their combined strength, the two Force users were overpowered by Sidious' attack through the Force. As a side effect, however, part of their life force transferred to the Emperor and began healing his cloned body. Sidious was astonished, realizing that his granddaughter and Vader's grandson were a dyad in the Force, and therefore, possessed a power equivalent to life itself.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nNeither Solo nor Rey were able to prevent the Emperor from draining them of more Force energy.

As far as he was concerned, the notion that the others were his equal was a lie.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 1\" /> Solo hated his full name; he felt as though everyone wanted him to be like his namesake he had never met, Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi, and that inheriting his father's invented surname represented how everything was a lie.

He soon grew resentful of his status as Snoke's apprentice, believing he would always be kept subservient as long as his Master was alive. Ren felt liberated by Snoke's death because it granted him the power and independence he had long coveted.

However, he was interested in understanding the views of those who opposed him, though he considered them \"radicals\" for doing so.

Ultimately, Ren believed that resistance was futile, and that it was his right to lead the galaxy as the Supreme Leader of the First Order.<ref name=\"Follow and Lead\" />\n\nRen was also distrustful of others; having isolated himself from his family and friends, the only people in Ren's life were subordinates and a master that he hated.

Ren treated Rey as though they were master and student, keeping her at bay and off balance by his questions. His facade, however, broke when Rey called him by the name he had been born with. In that moment, he looked lost.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\n[[File:Force-bond.png|thumb|left|260px|Ren understood Rey's sense of solitude and abandonment, having struggled with the same feelings throughout his life.]]\nRen understood Rey's feelings of solitude and abandonment; having experienced such emotions as well, he was all too familiar with the psychological effect they had on a person in the long term.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> He allowed Rey to confide in him and insisted that she was not alone. When Snoke ordered his apprentice to complete his training by killing Rey, Ren knew what he had to do.<ref name=\"Kylo Ren Bio Gallery\" /> In that moment, the oft-conflicted apprentice's fears and doubts gave way to a newfound sense of purpose and determination that surprised his own Master. He did not hesitate to kill the one he considered his true enemy, who turned out to be Snoke instead of Rey.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nRen wanted Rey to join him,<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> as he had when they first dueled on Starkiller Base,<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> by forming a co-regency between themselves as rulers of the galaxy.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Rey sensed that there was no threat in Ren's intentions toward her; he wanted Rey to overcome her past, and as such he told Rey that her parents were no one, believing that revelation would make her embrace the dark side as he did.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> Ren wanted Rey to be like him,<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\" /> yet his brutal honesty gave way to a softer approach when he beseeched her to join him, telling Rey that while she was no one, she was still important to him.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\n[[File:Rey_and_Ben_Solo.png|thumb|right|260px|Ren felt compassion for Rey, who cared about him as well.]]\nRey's refusal to join Ren left the dark warrior feeling betrayed. He wondered why Rey had not taken the opportunity to kill him while he was unconscious, and for a moment he contemplated the possibility that Rey actually cared for him. He pushed such thoughts aside, however, convinced that Rey's feelings made her foolish and sentimental, and would be the death of her.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> Ren vowed to destroy Rey along with everyone else who opposed him, but upon seeing her again through their bond,<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> he was left with a feeling of emptiness despite his recent accomplishments, which included his ascension as the new Supreme Leader.<ref name=\"Kylo Ren Bio Gallery\" />\n\n[[File:Dyad_in_the_Force.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Ren continued to pursue Rey, determined to prevent the apprentice from becoming a true Jedi.]]\nDespite his complete submission to the dark side of the Force,<ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> Ren's conflict remained and he was still tempted by the light side. He had thought that his father's death would bring an end to the agony within, only to realize, in time, that Han Solo represented his past, whereas Rey personified what he felt as the pull to the light. Though he was bidden to kill the scavenger by the clone of Darth Sidious, Ren feigned compliance. The discovery of her full origins reignited his desire to turn her to the dark side, yet he was also conflicted over whether it was worth the risk, now that he knew his struggle against the light was directly tied to Rey. His uncertainty was compounded by feelings of anger and resentment over her rejection of his first offer, which confounded Ren.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nRen sensed the terror that Rey felt whenever he was near her, and found it intoxicating, though her determination to resist him infuriated the Supreme Leader. The thought that she had dared to reject him fueled his rage, causing Ren to lose himself to his anger and hatred, forgetting for a moment about his plans to overthrow the Emperor and take control of the Star Destroyer fleet. Blinded by overwhelming rage and desperate to end his pain, he succumbed to the temptation of killing her. When the attempt failed, Ren chided himself for allowing Rey to use his anger against him, though he was even more stunned by the realization that he was relieved he had not killed her.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\n[[File:DyadofKyloRenandRey-TROS.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Ren's deepest desire was to rule the galaxy with Rey by his side.]]\nSnoke had trained Ren to channel the dark side by acting on his impulses, but now the impulse to kill Rey could not be reconciled with his deepest desire, for the thing he wanted most was Rey herself. He found the effort of tempting Rey difficult, yet worthwhile, and with each encounter between them, he felt increasingly closer to achieving his goal with her. Ren also came to understand that his plans for her required planning and patience, but he was well aware of his impatience and temper. As a result, he found inspiration in Rey's grandfather Sidious, wanting to be able to embrace a plan so long suffering and painstakingly careful, and being able to do it without feeling tempted by the light. Ren knew that he did not have the Emperor's patience, but in his desire to convert Rey, he was willing to learn it.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\nRen, whose mercurial nature inspired fear amongst his subordinates, maintained his composure around Rey. Her presence had a calming effect on him, although Rey found his calm irritating as she struggled to control her anger and frustration toward him. Following their confrontation on the ''Steadfast'', Ren found himself enjoying the experience of seeing Rey in person again, taking little notice of the dead and the injured around him. For Ren, any loss was a small price to pay to be with Rey. He delighted in provoking her rage; he wanted her to know that they were a dyad in the Force; and he enjoyed seeing the look on her face, which he regarded as beautiful, when he finally told her.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\n[[File:TheDyadVsTheEmperor-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rey's compassion played a part in the return of Ben Solo, who stood with her as a true dyad against Darth Sidious.]]\nAfter discarding the persona of Ren, Solo developed a new sense of purpose, which was to protect Rey. The need that he felt to stand at her side determined his actions for the remainder of his life, including his decision to die for her. Solo's return to the light also had an effect on his connection to Rey, changing the way the bond felt between them. Unlike with Ren, when the two halves of the dyad fought on opposite sides of the Force, the connection with Solo felt right to Rey. The differences between the personalities of Solo and Ren, as well as the way they fought as one on the side of the light, convinced Rey that this was how the bond between them was always meant to be. By standing together against Sidious, Solo and Rey achieved their true potential as a dyad in the Force, making their combined strength an equivalent to the power of life.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Lightsaber abilities===\n{{Quote|He really ''was'' the prize student.|Voe, on Ben Solo's overall ability as a Jedi|The Rise of Kylo Ren 1}}\n[[File:KyloHachette.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Ren's extraordinary powers were complemented by his skills as a lightsaber swordmaster.]]\nOut of the many apprentices his uncle trained, Ben Solo was the most talented and skilled with a lightsaber, although he was never able to surpass his uncle's skill in lightsaber combat.<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> Kylo Ren, Solo's dark side persona, was a ruthless and efficient combatant on the battlefield,<ref name=\"TSWB\" /> as well as master swordsman by the time of his apprenticeship to Snoke.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> Ren, who pulled from the teachings of the light and the dark to hone his power, possessed superb skills in lightsaber combat.

Back when he was still Ben Solo, he fought off three of his fellow students on Elphrona.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 3\" /> He fought alongside Rey against the Elite Praetorian Guard until they were separated, forcing Ren to fight four guardsmen on his own. He killed two Praetorians with his crossguard lightsaber and, using a dead guard's [[vibro-voulge]] as an improvised weapon in conjunction with his saber, demonstrated his ability in the art of [[Jar'Kai]] while defeating a third guard. Though he was outmaneuvered by the fourth and final Praetorian, Ren survived by stabbing the guardsman through the face with Rey's lightsaber.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> After reclaiming his identity as Ben Solo, although he was briefly outmatched by the Knights of Ren as he was outnumbered by his former subordinates, once armed with his grandfather's lightsaber, Solo<ref name=\"Episode IX\" /> reminded them why he had been their master<ref name=\"TROS Junior Novel\" /> and swiftly bested all six Knights on his own.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n[[File:Kylo_Ren's_Makeshift_Jar'Kai.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ren's swordsmanship extended to the use of Jar'Kai.]]\nRen's loss to Rey&mdash;a girl unfamiliar with the lightsaber&mdash;was an isolated case according to his master Snoke, who believed his apprentice lost because he was unbalanced by the murder of his father.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> Ren, however, held that he would have defeated Rey if not for the physical wound that he sustained from Chewbacca's bowcaster, preventing him from fighting at full strength.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" /> Despite her victory, Rey knew that Ren was strong with the dark side, and would only grow more powerful with time.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> Luke Skywalker even regarded his nephew Ren as a strong adversary who was far more powerful than Rey.<ref name=\"TLJ Adaptation 4\">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 4|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 4]]</ref> During the battle against the Praetorian Guards, neither emotional conflict nor physical injuries hindered Ren's fighting ability.

As such, he was adept at evading close-quarter attacks while unarmed, sidestepping Rey's blade several times before activating his own lightsaber.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" /> He was also skilled in hand-to-hand combat, seamlessly incorporating martial arts strikes into his lightsaber sequence, which he utilized against Finn<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> and the Praetorian Guards.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Even in his injured state, he deflected all but one of Finn's attacks that injured him in the shoulder,<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> and returned with his own fierce blows that overwhelmed Finn before disarming and severely injuring the stormtrooper.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> He maintained a fierce offense on Rey before she tapped into the Force to overwhelm him and managed to parry some of her blows afterward despite ultimately losing the duel.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nWhile Rey had improved her skills in lightsaber combat with a year's worth of training, she failed to break through Ren's guard in both of their later engagements. Ren found her attacks easy to dodge and block, even as her powers grew with her anger. During their final duel, it became clear to Rey that Ren was physically stronger than her. His ability to dodge and parry all of her attacks angered Rey, who grew increasingly frustrated by her failure to outfight Ren. After defending himself for a time, Ren seized the offensive with a series of swift and powerful strikes. The combination of his strength and skill ultimately overwhelmed Rey, causing Rey to lose her footing and to fall to her knees, completely exposed and defenseless. However, Ren was beckoned by his mother through the Force, sensed her death from afar, and dropped his lightsaber, leading Rey to capitalize on his distraction by usurping Ren's weapon and impaling him with it.<ref name=\"TROS EE\" />\n\n===Force powers===\n{{Quote|I've seen this raw strength only once before in Ben Solo.

During the duel on Elphrona, Solo managed to catch Voe in the air after pushing her over a cliff. Unlike before, he struggled to maintain his hold on her through the Force. Hennix's interference broke Solo's concentration completely, causing him to lose his grip on Voe.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 3\" /> On Starkiller Base, Ren found himself struggling to summon his grandfather's lightsaber to his hand, having sustained physical and emotional wounds in the wake of killing his own father.<ref name=\"TFA novel\" />\n\n[[File:A_Mysterious_Connection.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ren had the power to immobilize his targets, using the Force to make their bodies respond to his commands rather than their own.]]\nRen used his telekinetic skills to [[Force push]] Rey, sending her flying against a tree.

Then they have to deal with their emotions as best they can, with what they are.|''The Force Awakens'' co-writer Lawrence Kasdan, on Kylo Ren|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/12/star-wars-force-awakens-kylo-ren}}\n[[File:Kylo_Ren_Helmet.jpg|thumb|left|242px|Several unused helmet designs were considered for the \"Jedi Killer,\" the character who became Kylo Ren.]]\nOn [[October 30]], [[2012]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] purchased [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] from [[George Lucas]], the creator of ''[[Star Wars]]'', and announced that they would be making the long-awaited ''Star Wars'' [[sequel trilogy]], beginning with [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII]] in [[2015]]. In the months prior, as Lucasfilm co-chair (and eventual president) [[Kathleen Kennedy]] began the work to produce the new slate of films, it became clear to the creative team that the story could not just rely on characters from the previous films but would have to introduce new characters to carry the franchise forward.<ref name=\"Art of TFA\">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''</ref>\n\nSince George Lucas' earliest versions of the film's story, a son of Han Solo and Leia Organa struggling with the dark side of the Force was always in the mix. In some of these versions, the son's name was \"Skyler\" and he was corrupted to the dark side by [[Darth Talon]], a character originally created for the [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series set over a century after the films.<ref name=\"George's Original Plans\">{{Cite_web|url=https://naboonews.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/george-lucas-wanted-darth-talon-to-corrupt-han-and-leias-son-in-episode-vii/|title=George Lucas wanted Darth Talon to corrupt Han and Leia's son in Episode VII|date=2018-01-04|work=Naboo News|publisher=naboonews.wordpress.com|archivedate=20200317181103}}</ref> Talon's role was then morphed into that of the \"Jedi Killer,\" the initial name of the character who evolved into Kylo Ren, which was used throughout the film's pre-production before the director and co-writer [[J.J. Abrams]] and his team settled on a name for the character. The character's design went through a number of iterations before the final design was approved on [[March 11]], [[2014]]. One design made him look similar to Darth Vader. According to concept artist [[Christian Alzmann]], the idea behind the similarity was that Darth Vader, as a Lord of the Sith, was not a \"one-off\" look. Instead, \"he has a specific title and a specific look that goes with that title. Even though the mask was helping him breathe, there was still a certain look to it.\" Concept artist [[Glyn Dillon]], who designed the final look of the character, said that the design of the Jedi Killer was like \"trying to land a helicopter on a penny. We couldn't be too Vader-ish, but we couldn't reference something else too heavily, either.\"<ref name=\"Art of TFA\" />\n\n[[File:Kylo_Ren_concept_art_Guavian.png|thumb|right|229px|Kylo Ren's \"Jedi Killer\" concept art inspired the design of the Guavian security soldiers.]]\nAdditional design concepts showed the Jedi Killer as someone who ate matter from stars. He would be in a meditation chamber, where energies from a sun could come into the room and he would consume whatever power was within it. Another piece of art showed him with a more robotic look, holding the mask of Darth Vader; at one point, the mask of Darth Vader was a central element to the film, before becoming part of the shrine that Kylo Ren had in the final story. One rejected piece of concept art showed the Jedi Killer with a red and black mask with a circular pattern in the center. This design later inspired the appearance of the [[Guavian security soldier]]s, the cybernetically enhanced security soldiers of the [[Guavian Death Gang]].<ref name=\"Art of TFA\" />\n\nOther designs the crew worked on included a fortress for the Jedi Killer. Concept artist [[Doug Chiang]] took \"iconic shapes that we know from ''Star Wars''\" but put \"different material on them&mdash;in this case turning them into concrete instead of that slick painted metal.\" The crew also considered giving the Jedi Killer his own droid, such as a torture droid or something else that looked ominous.<ref name=\"Art of TFA\" /> The idea of the Jedi Killer having an interrogation droid ultimately made it into the film, with Kylo Ren using interrogation droids and other torture techniques to break his prisoners.<ref name=\"TFA VD\" />\n\nThe final design was meant to be memorable, much like Darth Vader's mask&mdash;upon which Ren's look was intentionally based. Costumer designer [[Michael Kaplan]] said that Abrams wanted the look to be memorable for kids, and that Abrams loved the final design when it was presented. In developing the character, original screenwriter [[Michael Arndt]], whose screenwriting duties were taken over by Abrams and co-writer [[Lawrence Kasdan]] when Arndt departed the project, said the character's backstory came about because the writers needed a rationale for the heroes of the [[original trilogy]] to have separated after the events of the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. Abrams wanted Episode VII, which came to be named ''The Force Awakens'', to tap into parental fears of a child gone wrong through Kylo Ren.<ref name=\"EW Kylo Shock\">{{Cite_web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/12/21/jj-abrams-kylo-ren-shocking-act-star-wars-force-awakens/|title=J.J.

Ren calling Vader his grandfather would have been the reveal, and the scene was written to take place shortly after Finn and Dameron escaped from the ''Finalizer''. Ren would have blamed himself for not having done anything about Finn's change of heart regarding the First Order, and he would have sought the counsel of his grandfather for guidance. Eventually, the film's editors, [[Mary Jo Markey]] and [[Maryann Brandon]], felt that the revelation came too early and it was a waste of a good moment.

He comes from a theater background, where actors never saw their own performances, and always hated noticing mistakes that he could not correct. He made an exception for ''The Force Awakens'', however, and watched the film in a private screening with just his co-stars [[Daisy Ridley]] and [[Carrie Fisher]], who played Rey and Leia Organa respectively.
