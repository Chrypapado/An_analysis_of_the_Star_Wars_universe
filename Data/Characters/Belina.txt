She had spent several nights with Wedge during their days on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. When Wedge and [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]] were stranded on [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], Wedge would reminisce about Belina and the great times he had had with her, hoping to keep his mind off the isolation. However, thinking about Belina only made Wedge more depressed.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDue to the dubious nature of this story and the contradictory backstory given to Wedge in [[Star Wars (1977) 78|''Star Wars'' (1977) 78]], it's unknown if Belina actually existed or was simply a fabrication of Wedge's story. The assertion that Wedge apparently met Belina when he was growing up on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], when he was actually from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], may point more heavily towards the latter.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 78|''Star Wars'' (1977) 78]] {{1st}} {{Po}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
