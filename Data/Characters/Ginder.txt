Around [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], while going through a shipment of scrap, Ginder came across the head of an [[L8O-series protocol droid]], [[L8O-RC]]. Finding that the head was highly prized by several factions, he sought to offload it before they caught up with him. While attempting to foist the head on a group of freelancers at the ''[[Falling Rodian]]'' [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], Ginder found himself in the middle of an all-out fight between some of the factions battling to secure the mysterious treasure, with the head being claimed by the freelancers.\n\n==Biography==\n{{RPG}}\n{{Quote|Some guys want it without paying.

The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' establishes that those events commenced one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]], which ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' dates to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], thereby placing \"Head Trip\" around [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]].</ref> In his home [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Tolea Biqua]], which [[Orbit/Legends|orbited]] the [[Gas giant/Legends|gas giant]] [[Genarius]]<ref name=\"Head Trip\" /> in the [[Expansion Region/Legends|Expansion Region's]]<ref name=\"EAOC\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-atlas-online-companion|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Atlas'' Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}} &mdash; Based on corresponding data for [[Cularin system]]</ref> [[Cularin system]], Ginder happened upon the head of an [[L8O-series protocol droid]], [[L8O-RC]], while looking through a pile of refuse from the local [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Uffel]]. Recognizing it as the kind of [[Droid/Legends|droid]] that the former [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] of the Cularin [[Star system/Legends|system]], [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], had used, he surmised that there might be some value in its data and shopped the head around.<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n\nHowever, Ginder's efforts only drew attention from [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] of the [[Thaereian military]] under the [[Commanding officer/Legends|command]] of [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Jir Tramsig]], as well as a rival gang of thugs attempting to curry favor with [[Nirama]], a mysterious [[Alien/Legends|alien]] who was the leader of the [[Organization|local crime syndicate]]. Neither party wanted to pay for the head, although they did not press the issue at first, opting to follow the Bimm. Unbeknownst to Ginder, there was also a third group following him&mdash;namely, a band of droids from Uffel who were trying to prevent information in the [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] head from benefiting anyone else.<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n\nFeeling that he was in an untenable situation, Ginder urgently contacted a group of freelancers to unload the head on them so that he could escape from the city. As he was meeting with the freelancers in the ''[[Falling Rodian]]'', a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] where Ginder had waited intermittently for several afternoons, the soldiers and the thugs showed up, and a battle over the head began. Ginder hid under a table during the brawl, and the head ultimately ended up in the possession of the freelancers.<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Am I glad you came.

I have to get off the planet.|Ginder, desperate to offload his perilous cargo|Head Trip}}\nGinder loved to haggle and subscribed to the Bimm belief that theft was on a par with murder. Known to be correct more often than he was wrong, Ginder was trustworthy and alert. [[Norben]], the [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] at the ''Falling Rodian'' cantina, found Ginder to be often nervous, with the matter surrounding the droid's head making the Bimm more shaky than usual. Despite his usual Bimm enthusiasm when bartering, Ginder was keen to offload the droid's head quickly, underscoring the desperation he felt at his situation. He stood around a [[Imperial standard meter|meter]] tall and had [[Color/Legends|tan]] fur, small dark [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], an elongated [[Nose/Legends|muzzle]], and long, floppy [[Ear/Legends|ears]].<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nGinder could speak and [[Writing system|write]] [[Bimmini]]; in addition, he could speak [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]] but was not literate in the [[Language/Legends|language]]. He could also utilize [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]].<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nGinder dressed in a yellow pair of trousers and a [[Jacket/Legends|jacket]] and carried a small amount of personal belongings with him.<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Eep!|Ginder ducking under a table in the ''Falling Rodian'' during the fight if it occurs|Head Trip}}\nGinder was created for \"[[Head Trip]],\" a [[2001]] mini-adventure supplement to the ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' from [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]'' exclusively available at [[Wizards.com]] and written by [[Jeff Grubb]]. The supplement suggests that the players can personally involve the heroes by mentioning that Ginder's family and their own relatives share connections.<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n\nThe confrontation in the ''Falling Rodian'' can be averted entirely if the heroes decide to surrender the head to Tramsig's soldiers, in which case Ginder will protest but acquiesce. If the fight scenario in the ''Falling Rodian'' takes place, Ginder can fruitlessly scramble to retrieve the droid head without taking part in the violence; again, however, whether or not this optional event occurs is left up to the players. This article assumes that the events played out as described in the supplement.<ref name=\"Head Trip\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20010419a|text=Head Trip|int=Head Trip|archivedate=20091015131221}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bimms]]\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scavengers]]"}}}]}}}}
