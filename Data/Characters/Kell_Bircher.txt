He almost reminds me of you, Lord Vader.|Palpatine to Darth Vader|Star Wars (2013) 1}}\n'''Kell Bircher''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who was a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Spy/Legends|spy]] and nephew of the Rebel leader, [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]]. Following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he used the skills of a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] to enter his identity in the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] database as a [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]]. He was able to parlay his station to become the commander of the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]], [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']], taking control of the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] from its previous commander, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. As commander of the ''Devastator'', he was involved in hunting down the [[Alliance Fleet|Rebel fleet]], personally piloting a [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE interceptor]] to engage Rebel forces. Bircher was eventually able to track the location of the Rebel fleet after following the Rebel [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], [[Prithi]], who had skirted protocols of making several different [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace jumps]] before returning to base. In the [[Attack on the Rebel Fleet|ensuing attack]], Bircher was forced to reveal his double agent status, shutting down his TIE interceptor squadron, and disabling ''Devastator''. The Imperial Star Destroyer was forced to abandon the attack while Bircher turned himself over to Mothma. Although the other Rebels were suspicious of him, Mothma vouched for his character, and he returned to the [[Chandrila system/Legends|Chandrila system]] to continue aiding the Alliance.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rebel spy===\n{{Quote|Kell and I conceived of this plan months prior to Yavin.

He was a student of political history and was a member of the [[Chandrilan Special Forces]]. He eventually became a devoted member of the Rebellion and was chosen for a secret mission for the Rebellion. With the aid of a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]], Bircher's name was inserted into the civilian and military databases of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. He was given the rank of [[Colonel/Legends|colonel]] and was able to smuggle himself into Imperial ranks shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]].<ref name=\"SW12\" />\n\n===Promotion===\n{{Quote|Bircher here.

He later briefed a group of [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE interceptor]] [[TIE pilot|pilots]], the best-of-the best who were going to fly advanced models. Bircher wore a red [[Flight suit/Legends|flight suit]].<ref name=\"SW 3 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 3|''Star Wars'' (2013) 3]]</ref> He personally led two squadrons of those pilots in an [[ambush of Gray Flight]]. When the Rebel X-wings launched proton torpedoes and destroyed eleven interceptors, he did not authorize a withdrawal. Instead, he called for evasion pattern [[Delta Delta Victor]]. The Rebels were able to escape from the ambush.<ref name=\"SW 5 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 5|''Star Wars'' (2013) 5]]</ref>\n\nWhen the ''Devastator'' chased the Rebels to their next ambush point, Bircher led the remaining Interceptors to face Gray Flight. The Rebels launched more torpedoes, and Bircher confirmed that they were going to miss the Star Destroyer. However, the Rebels were actually targeting a [[Power fusion generator|fusion generator]], which blew up. Bircher, at the last moment, realized that the Rebels were retreating and ordered his own forces to fall back. He then activated his hyperdrive to escape to rendezvous coordinates Beta One. The ''Devastator'' escaped, although their [[Unidentified Interdictor-class Star Destroyer (ambush of Gray Flight)|Interdictor]] was heavily damaged. Later, aboard the ''Devastator'', Bircher ordered updates on damage reports.<ref name=\"SW 6 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 6|''Star Wars'' (2013) 6]]</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, he was aboard the ''Devastator'' at a no-fly zone with an Imperial fleet. He ordered a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] piloted by the Rebels [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] to stand down and prepare to be boarded. He ordered a search, and then greeted [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Birra Seah]] as she arrived on the bridge.<ref name=\"SW 7 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 7|''Star Wars'' (2013) 7]]</ref> Bircher followed the [[Alliance Fleet]] and when they [[Attack on the Rebel Fleet|arrived]] at the coordinates, ordered all of his TIE fighters to launch. He planned on joining them himself.<ref name=\"SW 10 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 10|''Star Wars'' (2013) 10]]</ref> As the ''Devastator'' opened fire on the fleet, Bircher led his group into range. At two kilometers out, he ordered them to open fire. During the battle, he transmitted external control of the Imperial fighters over to [[Home One/Legends|''Home One'']] and jammed tactical communications. He then crashed aboard Hangar Five on the cruiser and met his aunt, [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]].<ref name=\"SW 11 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 11|''Star Wars'' (2013) 11]]</ref>\n\nBircher revealed himself as a Rebel spy and was forced to explain his actions to members of Gray Flight, claiming that he had always had a backup plan to shut down weapons control of his forces if he believed that they might kill any Rebel pilots. Although [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] offered Bircher a position in the newly formed [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] from the remains of Gray Flight, he was forced to decline as he had business back in the [[Chandrila system/Legends|Chandrila system]]. As he departed, he complimented Gray Flight's leader, [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], claiming that she was a \"damn fine pilot\".<ref name=\"SW12\" />\n\nIn response to Bircher's infiltration, Darth Vader embarked on a secret mission to eliminate the hackers who had placed him into the system, and to purge those who had fallen into his deception.<ref name=\"SW 13 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 13|''Star Wars'' (2013) 13]]</ref> Vader's search eventually brought him to [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], but Bircher was not at the Mothma home at the time when Vader destroyed it.<ref name=\"SW 14 (DH)\">[[Star Wars (2013) 14|''Star Wars'' (2013) 14]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Good stars.
