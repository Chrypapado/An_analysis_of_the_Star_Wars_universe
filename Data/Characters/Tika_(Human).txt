She gave [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Isolder]] the [[Datachip/Legends|datachip]] which demanded [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]] return the [[Hapan]]s to the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] war effort or the Hapan princess would forfeit her life. In return, if Tika did this one thing, Caedus promised to leave her on Hapes where there were thousands of beautiful women, one of whom would be willing to be her new mother. Like Allana, she had red hair and presumably bore a passing likeness to the [[Chume'da]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tika\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]"}}}]}}}}
