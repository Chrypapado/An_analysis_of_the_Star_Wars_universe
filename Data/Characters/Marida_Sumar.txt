The two were forced from their home by the [[Galactic Empire]], who had originally wanted to buy it from them but, after Sumar refused the offer, destroyed it and took the couple prisoner. They were later [[Attack on Imperial Troop Transports|rescued]] by [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]]. By [[2 BBY]], Marida and her husband had joined a [[Lothal resistance group|rebel cell]] led by Lothal's former [[Governor]] [[Ryder Azadi]]. She and her husband took part in a [[Infiltration of the Imperial Armory Complex|joint mission]] to infiltrate the Lothal [[Imperial Armory Complex]]. During the course of that mission, Marida lost her husband.\n\n==Biography==\n===Losing their farm===\n[[File:Morad_Sumar_taken_prisoner.png|thumb|left|250px|Marida and Morad are taken prisoner by Yogar Lyste]]\nMarida Sumar was a [[Gender|female]] [[human]] who lived during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]]. In [[4 BBY]], she and her husband [[Morad Sumar]] owned a [[Morad Sumar's farm|farm]] near the [[city]] of [[Kothal]]. Her husband made a living by selling [[jogan fruit]]s at a stall in the [[Kothal market]]. That year, the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Supply Master]] [[Yogar Lyste]] wanted to buy their farm but Morad refused to sell their livelihood to the Empire. Unwilling to let the matter rest, Lyste visited the farm with three [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transports]] and several [[stormtrooper]]s. After razing the farm, Lyste loaded Marida, her husband, and their [[Aqualish]] [[Unidentified Aqualish helper|helper]] onto the side compartments of a Troop Transport.<ref name=\"Fighter Flight\" />\n\nWhile traveling through the grassy plains of Lothal, the Sumars and their Imperial captors encountered a [[Rebels TIE fighter|TIE fighter]] that had been commandeered by [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]], the former a friend of Marida's husband. While the Imperials [[Attack on Imperial Troop Transports|exchanged fire]] with the rebel TIE fighter, Ezra managed to board the middle transport. Using [[the Force]], he freed Marida, her husband, and their Aqualish servant from their restraints. Marida, Morad, and their servant then managed to flee into the plains while Ezra and Zeb engaged the Imperials and escaped with a crate of [[meiloorun fruit]].<ref name=\"Fighter Flight\" />\n\n===Joining the rebellion===\n[[File:Lothal_resistance_meets_Ezra.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ezra meets with the Lothal resistance]]\nBy [[2 BBY]], Marida and her husband Morad had joined a [[Lothal resistance group|rebel cell]] headed by [[Ryder Azadi]], the former [[Governor]] of Lothal. Their cell specialized in sabotaging vehicles produced by the [[Imperial Armory Complex]] in [[Capital City]]. Her husband Sumar used his position as a factory worker to sabotage various vehicles including [[614-AvA speeder bike]]s and [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walkers]], causing the Empire to lose many personnel and missions. She, Morad, and the [[Ithorian]] bartender [[Jho]] were present when Ezra, his master [[Kanan Jarrus]], and the rebel [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] visited Ryder's [[stone circle]] encampment.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nWhen Marida and her comrades learned that Ezra and the [[Phoenix Cell]] were planning to take out the factory, they cheered. Since Ezra and his team planned to steal secret Imperial plans for a [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|new secret weapon]], her husband Morad agreed to help them infiltrate the factory using his position as a worker there. The following day, Morad and Ezra's team departed on their [[Infiltration of the Imperial Armory Complex|mission]]. However, Morad was killed when [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], who had been dispatched by [[Imperial High Command]] to investigate the high rate of faulty vehicles at the Lothal factory, forced him to test a faulty 614-AvA speeder bike.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n[[File:Marida_Sumar_and_Ryder_Azadi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Marida and Ryder arrive to support Ezra, Kanan and Chopper]]\nAfter losing contact with Ezra's team, Marida accompanied Ryder on a diversionary attack on the factory's east gate. Marida used her rocket launcher to damage an Imperial Troop Transport. In response, the Imperials sent two [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] to engage them. Ezra's team managed to escape the factory in a stolen AT-DP walker but were attacked by the AT-ATs. Marida used her rocket launcher to hit the foreleg of the AT-AT walker that was crushing the rebels' AT-DP walker. She and Ryder were pleasantly surprised when Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper emerged from the hatch of the AT-AT. Marida bowed her head in sadness when Ezra informed her that her husband Sumar had not survived the mission. After returning to Ryder's base on their two [[landspeeder]]s, the rebels discovered that Thrawn had been developed a prototype [[starfighter]] that was equipped with [[deflector shield]]s.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nLater, Marida and Ryder were patronizing Old Jho's [[Old Jho's Pit Stop|Pit Stop]] when they received a [[HoloNet]] transmission of the former Imperial [[Senator]] [[Mon Mothma]]'s speech urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nIn [[1 BBY]], Marida and Ryder survived an [[Raid on a suspected rebel cell|Imperial crackdown]] which claimed the life of Jho. After Ryder informed the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] about the new [[TIE/D Defender Elite]], the Spectres smuggled themselves in Lothal with the help of the crimelord [[Cikatro Vizago]]. After the Spectres evaded Imperial forces through Lothal's sewers, Marida and Ryder ferried them to safety in their [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]].<ref name=\"The Occupation\">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMarida Sumar was a human woman with [[Color|blue]] [[eye]]s and copper skin. She wore a white [[scarf]] around her head over a brown and white [[Clothing|top]].<ref name=\"Fighter Flight\" /> After joining Ryder's rebel cell, Marida learned how to fire a rocket launcher. She was visibly saddened after learning that her husband Morad did not survive an undercover mission at the Lothal Imperial factory.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMarida Sumar first appeared as a minor background character in the [[Star Wars Rebels Season One|''Star Wars Rebels'' Season One]] episode \"[[Fighter Flight]],\" which premiered on WatchDisneyXD.com on [[October 13]], [[2014]].
