He joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] alongside his father, becoming a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe was killed not long after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] when [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] brought the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] to destroy the Rebels that had been blockaded by the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. Vrad's [[Vrad Dodonna's scout ship|scout ship]] fled from the battle unharmed. Later, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] came across the graveyard of ships, and while looking at the devastation, Luke Skywalker glimpsed Vrad's ship. When the ''Falcon'' arrived on Yavin IV, his ship soon followed. After getting in a fight with Skywalker, they went on a mission to sabotage the ''Executor''. Utilizing an ancient [[power gem]] to pierce the ship's [[Deflector shield/Legends|shields]], he flew his [[Power-gem attack ship|craft]] in a suicide run straight at the ship, disabling it and buying more time for the Rebels to finish their [[Evacuation of Yavin|evacuation]]. His death devastated his father.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn {{FFCite|21}}, Vrad was erroneously called General Dodonna's nephew.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Doom Mission]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Race for Survival]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{CollectorCite|3|ComicScan|ComicScan: Coming Full Circle}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|21|SKY10, ''Luke Skywalker''}} {{Imo}}\n*{{FFCite|89|PIE3, ''Admiral Firmus Piett''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 12]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|generaljandodonna|Dodonna, General Jan|archivedate=20110517075139}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Vrad Dodonna\n|da=Vrad Dodonna\n|nl=Vrad Dodonna\n|ru=\u0412\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0414\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dodonna, Vrad}}\n[[Category:Alliance Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Commenori]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
