He and his fellow slaves were building the [[Unfinished colossus]] when he was rescued and taken [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] by [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Dak-Ah]]. He was convinced by the Imperial that he had no way offworld and that his family would forget about him. Opposites attract and the pair fell in love, though Dak-Ah told him to pretend that he's her brother in public. His [[Altaca family|family]] attempted to recover him alive by placing a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on him as part of the [[Great Hunt (competition)|Great Hunt]].\n\nHis [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] was recovered by a [[Hunter (individual)|participant]] of this competition who followed his traces to the [[Nexus Room|Nexus Room Cantina]]. The bounty hunter encountered Altaca and Lady Dak-Ah together. When confronted, the hunter revealed that Altaca's family wanted him back. This caused Altaca to become upset at Dak-Ah's deception. After Lady Dak-Ah expressed displeasure at the idea of losing Altaca to someone else, she asked the hunter to [[Death/Legends|kill]] him, explaining that his family would likely pay less for his body, but that she would compensate the rest of the payment.\n\n{{GameDS}}\nThe Hunter refused to make a deal with Lady Dak-Ah and killed her before capturing Altaca.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe player has two alternatives in the scenario where they confront Altaca. They can either accept Lady Dak-Ah's deal and kill Altaca instead, or simply take Altaca alive without killing either one.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]"}}}]}}}}
