After being sent to [[Nam Chorios/Legends|Nam Chorios]], he fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and established himself as the ruler of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. He was killed in a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] duel with [[Leia Organa Solo]] in [[13 ABY/Legends|13 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\nDiscovered by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] before [[400 BBY]], records indicate that Beldorion was the only known [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] to enter into the Order. He was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] at the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. During his training, he and other Jedi Initiates were taken to the [[Caves of Masposhani|Caves of]] [[Masposhani]], where they ran races, and to dark worlds like [[Af'El]] and [[Y'nybeth]] to hone their [[Force sense/Legends|Force sense]]. Beldorion [[Jedi Initiate Trials|graduated]] from the [[Jedi academy|academy]] and was taken as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] by a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]]. Following years of travel and study, Beldorion passed his [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]] and was [[Knighting ceremony/Legends|elevated]] to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. Taking on missions from the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]], Beldorion was dispatched to [[Nam Chorios/Legends|Nam Chorios]] with fellow Knight [[Taselda]] in [[400 BBY]].<ref name=\"POT\" />\n\nWhile on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] the two Jedi Knights failed to complete their mission when they fell to the lure of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] and abandoned the Order. Beldorion cast aside Taselda as the weaker half of the team and established himself as the ruler of the world. Providing his subjects with honorifics which he should be addressed by such as \"Beldorion of the Ruby Eyes\" and \"Beldorion the Splendid,\" Beldorion was corrupt and enslaved many. While originally prepared as Beldorion's meal, the [[Droch]] known as [[Dzym]] came to conspire with the Hutt, helping the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] remain strong and youthful in exchange for the freedom to access the planet's rare [[Tsil]] stones.<ref name=\"POT\" />\n\n[[File:Beldorian_Leia_Duel_TEC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Leia Organa Solo fighting Beldorion.]]\nAvoiding the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]], it wasn't until [[13 ABY/Legends|13 ABY]] that Beldorion's relatively unopposed rule was disrupted by the arrival of Jedi [[Callista Ming]]. While she was unsuccessful in getting to the Hutt and imprisoned, her disappearance drew the attention of additional Jedi: [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], the founder of the [[New Jedi Order|rebuilt Order]], and his twin sister, [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]. Like Ming, Organa was also captured by the Hutt who divulged stories from the past, recalling the histories of Jedi Masters [[Thon]] and [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]]. During her captivity, Organa was able to regain possession of her lightsaber and engage her captor in a duel. Though the centuries-old Dark Jedi was powerful, Organa was able to move more freely and [[Sai tok/Legends|bisected]] the Hutt at the mid-section.<ref name=\"POT\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBeldorion was somewhat adept in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], though by the time Leia Organa Solo encountered him in [[13 ABY/Legends|13 ABY]], his strength had greatly decayed as a result of centuries of [[Dzym]] feeding off his energy. Nevertheless, he was still powerful enough to generate huge [[Force storm (weather)|Force storms]]. Additionally, he was able to use [[Telekinesis/Legends|Telekinesis]] to summon a glass, though when he attempted the same feat with a tray he was unsuccessful. When angered by his servant, [[Liegeus Vorn]], he would occasionally use the Force to inflict painful migraines as punishment. Beldorion had some skill using [[Mind trick/Legends|Force persuasion]], and his gaze was considered by some to be hypnotic. However, he failed to use this power to influence Leia Organa Solo, who was only marginally trained in the Force and was drugged at the time.\n\nUnlike most Hutts, Beldorion used the Force to maintain a muscular form, allowing him to retain his prowess with a lightsaber after several centuries of life. Having crafted a lightsaber with a [[Lightsaber|purple blade]], Beldorion would change the trajectory of his lightsaber strikes in a battle, demonstrating some attributes of the [[Form VII/Legends|seventh form]] of lightsaber combat.<ref name=\"POT\" />\nAdditionally, his immense strength enabled him to swing his blade with a massive force nearly sufficient to break the wrists of a Human. However, his skills with a lightsaber were not sufficient to defeat Leia Organa Solo, who killed him at the conclusion of their brief duel.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn ''The New Essential Chronology'', ''The New Essential Guide to Characters'', ''Balance Point'', and ''Conviction'', his name is erroneously spelled Beldorian.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Planet of Twilight]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20020905twilight|text=The Planet of Twilight|int=The Planet of Twilight|archivedate=20090917014142}}\n*{{FFCite|140|HUT18, ''The Hutts''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Beldorion\n|es=Beldorion\n|pl=Beldorion\n|pt=Beldorion\n|ru=\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Fallen Jedi]]\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Nam Chorios residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
