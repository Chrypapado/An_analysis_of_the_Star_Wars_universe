Keto had a son named [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]] who, along with Magda's daughter [[Aleema Keto|Aleema]], was the heir to the [[Tetan Monarchy|throne]] of the [[Star system/Legends|system]]. Keto shared his dominion over the system with the commercial interests that operated [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] [[Mining/Legends|mines]] within the Empress Teta system, and he cut many back-room deals with the mining executives. Keto's indifference toward his heirs, however, drove them to form a [[darksider]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]] called the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]]. In [[3997 BBY]], Satal and Aleema decided to use [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Sith magic]] to [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|overthrow]] Lord Keto and his sister. The Krath struck while Keto and his sister were on an inspection tour on one of the [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] [[Tetan carbonite smelter]]s over the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]]. While Keto ordered his [[Royal Protector]]s into action, they were decimated by Satal and Aleema's [[magic]]. With no one left to defend him, Keto was captured by the insurgent heirs and was [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|frozen]] in carbonite along with his sister Magda, [[Death/Legends|killing]] him. His carbon-frozen body was put on display as a decoration on the walls of the [[Iron Citadel/Legends|Iron Citadel]], his old palace&ndash;turned&ndash;headquarters of Satal and Aleema in Empress Teta's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|You've had your day in the sun, Father. Now you can spend eternity on my wall!|Satal Keto, before encasing his father in carbonite|audio=DayInTheSun-DLOTS.ogg|Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] Keto, along with his sister [[Magda Keto]], ruled the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] prior to the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].<ref name=\"nec\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> The Ketos were the descendants of [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta]], the [[Gender/Legends|female]] warrior who [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|unified]] the seven [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] of the then&ndash;Koros [[Star system/Legends|system]] nearly [[5000 BBY/Legends|a thousand years]] prior. At some point, Keto had a son named [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]]. Along with Magda Keto's daughter [[Aleema Keto|Aleema]], Satal was the successor to the [[Tetan Monarchy|Tetan throne]]. By [[3997 BBY]], the Ketos were forced to share their power with the commercial interests that ran [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] [[Mining/Legends|mining]] operations within the system, and they cut many back-room deals with the mining executives. That year, Lord Keto and his sister visited a [[Tetan carbonite smelter]] over the planet [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]] to make their annual inspection tour of the station. The two were greeted by [[Bearus]], [[Chairman/Legends|chairman]] of the system's [[Carbonite Guild]]. While the Ketos and Bearus exchanged pleasantries, they received word that a royal [[Starship/Legends|ship]] containing Satal and Aleema Keto, their tutor [[Korus]], and four others had docked at the smelting plant. Keto and the others were very displeased with the arrival of Korus and the students, unaware of their intent for coming to the smelter. Satal and Aleema had become adepts in [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Sith magic]] and, driven by Lord Keto's indifference toward them, formed a [[darksider]] organization called the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] determined to take control of the Empress Teta system.<ref name=\"darklords1\" />\n\n[[File:Lordketo.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Lord Keto, moments before being lowered into molten carbonite.]]\nLord Keto and Bearus continued on with the inspection, and the Emperor was pleased with what he saw. During the inspection, Korus and his students, including Satal and Aleema, arrived at their location. Keto scolded Korus for bringing the students during a royal inspection, calling it an unforgivable breach of protocol, but Korus did not respond. Satal asked his father not to pick on Korus and instructed the tutor to open his mouth and reveal what Aleema had done to his tongue. Korus did so, showing that Aleema had used the dark side to turn his tongue into an [[Adegan eel]].<ref name=\"darklords1\" /> The Ketos were horrified, and Bearus moved to call for security. Aleema then [[Mind trick/Legends#Force illusion|turned]] the communications console into a [[Womp rat/Legends|womp rat]].<ref name=\"audio\">[[Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith'' audio adaptation]]</ref> Lord Keto called for his [[Royal Protector]]s to arrest the young Tetan heirs, but Aleema responded by turning the guards' [[Sword/Legends|swords]] into [[Snake/Legends|snake]]-like monsters that strangled them. A terrified Lord Keto tried to calm the guards by telling them that the snakes were not real but to no avail. Now without any protection, Keto ordered his son to stand down, but Satal refused.<ref name=\"darklords1\" /> Satal and Aleema informed the angered Keto that they had already legally taken control of the Empress Teta system.<ref name=\"audio\" /> The heirs led the now&ndash;former rulers of the Tetan worlds to a vat of molten carbonite, and dipped both Lord Keto and Magda Keto in the container, [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|freezing]] them in carbonite and [[Death/Legends|killing]] them. Their [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|coup]] successful, Satal and Aleema hung both Lord Keto and Magda Keto on the walls of their palace, the [[Iron Citadel/Legends|Iron Citadel]], where the former rulers remained as decorations.<ref name=\"darklords1\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Why are you always so pompous and cold?|Satal Keto|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 1}}\nLord Keto was a man described as \"pompous and cold\" by his son Satal and referred to as a \"windbag\" by his niece Aleema. Keto held a measure of resentment toward his son and niece in return, thinking of them as spoiled.<ref name=\"audio\" /> He was not above using ruthless tactics during his family's reign over the Empress Teta system, employing torture [[Droid/Legends|droids]] to keep control of the populace and forging back-room deals with the carbonite smelting companies that worked in the system.<ref name=\"darklords1\" /> Keto was more concerned with his duties as ruler of the system than his duties as a father to his son Satal, which fostered anger and hatred within his child. He had the ability to act harshly when angered quickly, berating Korus for interrupting his royal inspection of the carbonite smelting plant. His anger devolved into fear when the Krath started using the dark side to attack his Royal Protectors.<ref name=\"audio\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLord Keto first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]'', a story arc of the ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series written by [[Kevin J.
