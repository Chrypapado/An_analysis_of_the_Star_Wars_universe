He had an inclination for [[Dismemberment|removing]] [[limb]]s, often being held back from doing so by his associates, to his disappointment. After the [[bounty hunter]]s [[4-LOM]] and [[Zuckuss]]&mdash;with whom Trot was familiar&mdash;were defeated by fellow [[Hunting|hunter]] [[Boba Fett]] on Nar Shaddaa, Zuckuss stumbled into the [[Jega's Music Hall and Petting Zoo|establishment]] where Trot and his crew resided. Trot spoke with Zuckuss, informing him of 4-LOM's supposed destruction at Fett's hands. However, 4-LOM had been rebuilt by [[Doctor]] [[Cribiriz Idollax]], a former target of the two hunters; under Idollax's control, the [[droid]] arrived, intent on [[Death|killing]] his partner. Trot and his friends fought against 4-LOM as Zuckuss tracked down and killed Idollax. Freed from Idollax's control, 4-LOM ceased the attack and departed, leaving Zuckuss alone as Trot's associates celebrated their victory.<ref name=\"WOTBH 4&Z\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Trot}}\n*[[War of the Bounty Hunters &ndash; 4-LOM & Zuckuss 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters &ndash; 4-LOM & Zuckuss'' 1]] {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Lurmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
