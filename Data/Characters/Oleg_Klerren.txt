He had two aides named [[Cohn]] and [[Ixa]] assisting him with his duties. When Anchorhead was hit by a series of bombings that killed over a hundred of people, Oleg was glad to see [[Havoc Squad]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] arrive with help. They were contacted by a former Havoc Squad member, [[Vanto Bazren]], who told them that Imperial [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Gorik]] was behind the bombings. Havoc Squad was able to stop Gorik and rescue Fuse, for which Oleg was extremely grateful.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u041a\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Klerren, Oleg}}\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
