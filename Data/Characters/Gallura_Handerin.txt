She first requested the spacer to check all the government drop boxes in Coronet City. She then asked the spacer to recover a [[Stormtrooper armor/Legends|stormtrooper armor]] stolen from an [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]] in the Capitol. She was very satisfied when the spacer brought back the armor even before the officer could notice the robbery. Eventually, Handerin tasked the spacer to find a missing government courier. However, the courier was assassinated by the criminal [[Preens B'oola]] in order to steal the government documents that the courier was carrying. B'oola asked for a huge ransom of 1,000,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] but the spacer killed him and recovered the documents. For all those services, Gallura Handerin then recommended the spacer to [[Brantlee Spondoon]], the aide to the [[Diktat]].<ref name=\"SWG:WftG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGallura Handerin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:WftG\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nMack Jasper was added to the game with the expansion ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan]]'', released on [[November 1]], [[2005]].
