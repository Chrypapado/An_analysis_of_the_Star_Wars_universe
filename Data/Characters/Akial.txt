He trained at the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy]] that was located on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]], where he specialized as a [[Jedi Consular]]. After participating in the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]], he graduated from the Academy, becoming a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. A short [[Time/Legends|time]] afterward, Akial and the [[Kel Dor/Legends|Kel Dor]] [[Jedi Guardian]] [[Krin D'bis]] were sent to represent the Academy at a celebration that was being held at [[Greentree Pointe]] resort on [[Dorumaa]], the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of Almas.\n\n==Biography==\nAkial was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He became a member of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and attended the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy]] that was located on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]], in the [[Cularin system]]. While there, he trained to become a [[Jedi Consular]],<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> a Jedi specialization that focused on studying the mysteries of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].<ref name=\"SWRGRCR\">''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook]]''</ref> During the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Akial undertook the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]], which he passed and he became a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\nA short time after his graduation, Akial was picked to be an official representative of the Academy at a celebration that was being held on [[Dorumaa]], the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of Almas. The celebration had been organized by the [[Metatheran Cartel]],<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> a trade organization that was jointly run by members of the [[Caarite]] and [[Filordus]] [[Species/Legends|species]].<ref name=\"LFCG\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref> They had organized the event to thank a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]]<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> for preventing the release of a [[Anti-Caarite virus|dangerous virus]] on the [[Caarimon|Caarite homeworld]].<ref name=\"BotB\">''[[Belly of the Beaast]]''</ref>\n\nThe [[Kel Dor/Legends|Kel Dor]] [[Jedi Guardian]] [[Krin D'bis]] was chosen to accompany Akial. Due their different specializations within the order, they could represent different approaches to being a Jedi and show that the order was not single-minded. They traveled to [[Greentree Pointe]] resort on Dorumaa, where the celebration was being held and they set up a booth there, to try and recruit potential students for the Academy. While at the celebration, Akial and D'bis debated the threat posed by the [[Believers]], a [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]] that operated in the Cularin system. They both agreed that the Believers were a major problem for the system, but disagreed over how to deal with the cult. D'bis suggested that the Believers should be hunted down, but Akial thought that it would be better to investigate the capabilities of the cult, as little was known about what their goals were. They also discussed the Metatheran Cartel, which had committed many past transgressions in the Cularin system, such as destroying the [[sacred ch'hala tree grove]]. Akial believed that the Cartel should be forgiven if it re-established its diplomatic position in the system and demonstrated itself to be trustworthy.<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAkial was a [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]],<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> a diminutive [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] species that was native to the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name=\"UAA\">''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''</ref> He disliked it when people acknowledged his heritage by saying \"Utinni,\"<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" /> a common word in the [[Jawaese/Legends|Jawa language]],<ref name=\"GPBaTG\">[[Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide (real-life book)|''Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide'']]</ref> to him, as he could speak [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] without an accent.<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAkial was created by [[Morrie Mullins (person)|Morrie Mullins]] and made his only appearance in ''[[Paarty On!]]'', a scenario in the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign. The campaign was a supplement to the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]'', and ''Paarty On!'' was an interactive scenario, which was intended for use at roleplaying events. The scenario outlined how event staff would play the roles of the various non-player characters, such as Akial, and interact with players of the campaign. It encouraged the people playing Akial and D'bis to involve the players in their debate about the Believers and the Cartel, and to also discuss the nature of the Force with them.<ref name=\"Paarty On!\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Paarty On!]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pt=Akial\n}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Jawas]]\n[[Category:Jedi Consulars]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
