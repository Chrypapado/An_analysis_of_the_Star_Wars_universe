Trusting in his power of foresight, he lurked about [[Treasure Ship Row/Legends|Treasure Ship Row]] and other likely places, looking to strike down and destroy the next [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] or [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] before they gained prominence. He owned a [[YZ-775]] [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] named the ''[[Mutilator]]''.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDescribed as \"in his late twenties\" shortly after the establishment of the New Republic, it is impossible that Gilflyn existed at the time of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]]. He may have been self-taught, without a [[Jedi Master/Legends|master]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Fallen Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi]]"}}}]}}}}
