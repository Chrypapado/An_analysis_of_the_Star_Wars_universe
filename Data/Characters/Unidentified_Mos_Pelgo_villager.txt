Therefore, the events of ''The Mandalorian'' must have taken place around [[9 ABY]].</ref> these tensions came to a head when Mos Pelgo's [[marshal]], [[Cobb Vanth]], brokered a truce between the villagers and the Tuskens in order to band together and kill a [[krayt dragon]] that plagued both groups. The villager voiced his repulsion to the idea, angered that the Tuskens had raided the small town's mines in the past.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\nLater, while loading explosive devices onto the Raiders' [[bantha]] mounts, the villager entered into an altercation with a Tusken, who accidentally dropped one of the charges. At the behest of Vanth, however, the man dropped the subject. Together, the two groups were eventually able to take down the dragon with the help of the [[Mandalorian]] [[Din Djarin]].<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe villager appeared in the [[The Mandalorian Season Two|second season]] [[Chapter 9: The Marshal|premiere]] of the [[2019]] television series ''[[The Mandalorian]]'',<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" /> which aired on [[October 30]], [[2020]] on [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Airdate\">{{D23|everything-new-you-can-stream-on-disney-in-october-2020|Everything New You Can Stream on Disney+ in October 2020|archivedate=20201016204229}}</ref> He was portrayed by [[Dieterich Gray]].<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 9: The Marshal}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Aldeano de Mos Pelgo no identificado\n|fr=Villageois de Mos Pelgo non-identifi\u00e9\n|ka=\u10db\u10dd\u10e1-\u10de\u10d4\u10da\u10d2\u10dd\u10e1 \u10e3\u10ea\u10dc\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8 \u10db\u10d9\u10d5\u10d8\u10d3\u10e0\u10d8\n}}\n\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
