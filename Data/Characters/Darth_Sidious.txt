Rising to power in the [[Galactic Senate|Republic Senate]] as the [[senator]] of [[Naboo]], the secretive [[Sith Lord]] cultivated two identities, Sidious and Palpatine, using both to further his [[Politics|political]] career. He orchestrated the fall of the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Jedi Order]] through the [[Clone Wars]], and then [[Proclamation of the New Order|established]] his [[Imperial Era|reign]] over [[the galaxy]] which lasted until his [[death]] at the [[Battle of Endor]]. However, the [[dark side of the Force]] gave rise to [[Transference|powers]] which allowed the Emperor to [[Immortality|return from the grave]].\n\nBorn on the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] [[planet]] Naboo around [[84 BBY]] during the [[Republic Era]], Sidious possessed a [[Force-sensitive|strong connection]] to [[the Force]], and was secretly trained in the ways of the [[Sith]] by [[Darth Plagueis]]. He eventually killed his [[Sith Master]] in order to train his own [[Sith apprentice]], [[Maul|Darth Maul]], for the [[Rule of Two]] limited their ranks to two Sith [[Lord]]s at any given [[time]]. As a result of the [[Invasion of Naboo]], a crisis orchestrated by Sidious, the Senate elected Palpatine as [[Supreme Chancellor]]. The [[Separatist Crisis]] and the Clone Wars were masterminded by Sidious and his new apprentice, [[Dooku|Darth Tyranus]], in an effort to achieve [[Galaxy|galactic]] dominance. Following an attempt to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest the chancellor]], the [[Great Jedi Purge]] commenced with Sidious enacting [[Order 66]].\n\nWith the [[Jedi]] all but extinct, Sidious installed the [[New Order]] in the Republic's place, declaring himself Galactic [[Emperor]] and bringing an end to a [[millennium]] of [[democracy]]. Not too long after betraying and causing the death of Tyranus, he took on a new apprentice, having lured the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] to the dark side and transforming him into [[Darth]] Vader. Their reign was virtually unchallenged for a generation until the formation of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War]], the Emperor sought to betray Vader, by replacing him with the latter's son, [[Luke Skywalker]]. However, Sidious' plan backfired when Vader ultimately renounced the dark side and killed Sidious to protect Luke. Thus, with the Sith's destruction, the Force was brought back into balance, fulfilling Anakin's destiny as the prophesied [[Chosen One]].\n\nThrough his master's teachings, however, Sidious transferred his essence to an imperfect [[Cloning|clone]] vessel that had been [[Clone template|modeled]] on his original body. Anticipating the possibility of defeat, he created the [[Contingency]] to [[Battle of Jakku|destroy]] the Galactic Empire and replace it with a new [[Sith Empire]], in the event of such a setback. His plans culminated in the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the [[New Republic]] and the [[First Order-Resistance War|emergence]] of the [[First Order]], the [[Strand-Cast|creation]] of [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]], who turned [[Ben Solo]]&mdash;heir to the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker bloodline]]&mdash;to the dark side, and the establishment of the [[Final Order]]. When the Emperor [[Palpatine's broadcast|announced]] his return to the galaxy in [[35 ABY]], the [[Resistance]] [[Battle of Exegol|invaded]] the planet [[Exegol]], Sidious' hidden stronghold in the [[Unknown Regions]]. During the battle, he discovered a [[Force dyad|dyad in the Force]] in the form of the [[Force-bond|bond]] between Solo and [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], a [[Padawan|Jedi apprentice]] [[Rey's father|sired]] from the Emperor's [[Palpatine family|bloodline]]. His lifelong dream of eternal rule was finally quashed when Rey called upon the strength of past Jedi to vanquish her grandfather by turning his own [[Force lightning|power]] against him, destroying Sidious and his [[Sith Eternal]] [[Sith cultist|cultists]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and political career===\n{{Quote|My mentor taught me everything about the Force, even the nature of the dark side.|Darth Sidious, to Anakin Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\n[[File:DarthSidious-SWE.png|thumb|left|250px|Sheev Palpatine was secretly trained as a Sith Lord, taking the name of Darth Sidious.]]\nThe origins of [[Darth]] Sidious were closely guarded secrets that he took to his [[Burial|grave]] more than once.

Palpatine often lauded Tarkin for his talents and skills and remarked they were very similar: they both came from planets at the edge of the galaxy but were destined to have great repercussions on the [[Timeline of galactic history|history of the galaxy]] itself.

When Gunray questioned the legality of the invasion, Sidious simply stated that he would make it legal. The Neimoidians acted accordingly, but the Jedi survived the [[assassin]]ation attempt and [[Escape from the Saak'ak|escaped]] the [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|Federation ship]]. After Sidious terminated his communication with Gunray, [[Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] contacted him concerning the Federation's denial that the Chancellor had sent ambassadors to speak with them as promised. Sidious, as Palpatine, feigned concern at this supposed revelation, but was cut off mid-sentence by the Trade Federation's communication blackout, notifying the Naboo to their invasion.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nThe Federation's [[droid]] army proceeded with their assault. Within a day, the army [[Capture of Theed|occupied]] the planet's capital city and its surrounding regions. Additionally, Amidala and her retinue were captured and presented with a treaty that would bring an air of legitimacy to their invasion. However, the Jedi arrived to rescue them, and they successfully evaded the blockade aboard the queen's [[J-type 327 Nubian royal starship|starship]].<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Sith_Lords_Trade_Federation.png|thumb|right|250px|Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala escaped from the Trade Federation, causing Sidious to send Maul after her.]]\nWhen Gunray informed Sidious of Amidala's failure to sign the treaty, the livid Sith [[Lord]] introduced them to Darth Maul, whom he dispatched to find and recapture Amidala. Due to Amidala's ship sustaining damage in the escape, the queen opted to land on [[Tatooine]], an obscure desert world in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], to repair the ship. Maul managed to ascertain the queen's location, and assured his master that his search on the sparsely populated world would be a short one. Sidious told him to move against the Jedi first, and then take the queen once they were dead. Maul left for Tatooine, but he [[Duel on Tatooine|failed]] to kill the Jedi or retrieve Amidala.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n====The Senate====\n{{Quote|Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.|Sheev Palpatine, to Queen Amidala|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\nWhile waiting for Amidala to reach Coruscant, Sidious found he had little to do, although he made sure to go to the Senate to vote on its current matters, even though he did not care for them. With nothing else to do, Palpatine took to looking through his catalogue of art, having run out of space in his office to store the rest of his collection. He stopped his scrolling when he saw a black statue from [[Yonta Prime]], which, despite being one of his favorite pieces, he found he could not fit into his office without looking careless. He resolved to take it out of storage, ordering it to be taken to his apartment, so he could place it into the Supreme Chancellor's office when his current plan had finished.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" />\n\n[[File:Amidala_arrives_on_Coruscant.png|thumb|left|250px|Senator Palpatine personally welcomed Queen Amidala to Coruscant, the capital world of the Galactic Republic.]]\nDespite these setbacks, Palpatine was able to convene with Amidala on [[Coruscant]], where she intended to plead her case to Chancellor Valorum before the Galactic Senate. Bringing Amidala to his apartment for an audience, Palpatine told the queen that the senate was long past caring about the common good, while Valorum was essentially powerless against them. With both the Senate and Valorum closed off to her as options, Palpatine offered her two choices: she could move for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Chancellor Valorum, and push for the election of a more effective leader; or she could take the matter to the courts, which would take even longer. Hoping still to reach some resolution to the matter in the Senate, Amidala opted to attend the special session of the body the next day.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Amidalabeforesenate.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Faced with a growing crisis on Naboo, Amidala heeded Palpatine's advice, calling for stronger leadership in the Senate.]]\nDuring the awaited Senate session, Amidala attempted to make her case for Republic intervention to stop the Trade Federation's occupation of her world. However, the Federation representative [[Lott Dod]] fervently objected to the\"accusations\" levied against the Federation, citing that there was no proof that an invasion or occupation had even occurred. He recommended that a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth of the situation, a motion that was seconded by the Senator from [[Malastare]], [[Aks Moe]]. [[Vice Chair]] [[Mas Amedda]] conferred quietly with Valorum for a few moments, and Palpatine took the opportunity to predict that the Chancellor, shackled to Senatorial procedure at the behest of bureaucrats who were more than likely on the payroll of the Federation, would fail to help Naboo. When Valorum reluctantly admitted that the Federation was within their rights to request a commission, an outraged Amidala realized that Palpatine was right; Valorum was too weak and ineffectual to provide her world with the help it needed. As such, she took Palpatine's advice and publicly moved for a Vote of No Confidence in the Chancellor. Within moments, hundreds of Senators began demanding for an immediate vote, leaving Valorum thunderstruck.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nThe sudden power vacuum led to Palpatine's nomination as Supreme Chancellor alongside [[Bail Antilles]] of [[Alderaan]] and [[Ainlee Teem]] of Malastare. When he announced his nomination to Amidala, however, the queen declared her intention to return to Naboo and reclaim it from the Trade Federation by whatever means she could. Palpatine made a show of concern and tried halfheartedly to convince her to stay on Coruscant. She left regardless, taking both Jinn and Kenobi with her for protection and wishing Palpatine success in the election.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n====Battle of Naboo====\n{{Quote|Wipe them out.

Even while he managed the election on Coruscant, he made time to go over the Neimoidians' progress. Against his expectations, he learned that Amidala not only managed to escape Gunray's reach but also forged an alliance with the [[Gungan]]s and assembled an army in the planet swamp in preparation for a strike against the Federation occupation force. He doubted she would last even five minutes in such a contest, and gave his approval to Gunray's plan to [[Battle of Naboo|meet]] the Gungans head-on.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nUltimately, Palpatine won the election for Supreme Chancellor. However, the Federation army was defeated, Gunray was captured by Amidala's forces, and Maul met his presumed death at the hands of the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, though not before striking down Qui-Gon Jinn, whose [[Jedi funeral|funeral]] Palpatine would later attend. Palpatine also learned that the Naboo owed their victory to the unexpected intervention of [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young, freed slave from Tatooine who was highly attuned to the Force, fueling the belief that he was the [[Chosen One]] of Jedi prophecy who would bring balance to the Force. After much debate, the Jedi Council decided that Skywalker would be apprenticed to Kenobi as a Jedi.

As Anakin Skywalker grew older, his relationship with Palpatine deepened; on many occasions, Palpatine lauded Skywalker as the most gifted Jedi he had ever encountered, one who would surpass even [[Yoda]], the [[Grand Master]] of the Jedi Council. Skywalker, who grew increasingly frustrated with the strict lifestyle of the Jedi under his master Kenobi's guidance, appreciated Palpatine's praise and greatly took to his counsel. In truth, this was all part of Sidious' plan to gain Skywalker's trust and groom him into his eventual Sith apprentice.<ref name=\"SWEPalpatine\" /><ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nHowever, Sidious was well aware that his plan to turn Skywalker to the dark side could not bear fruit for many years to come, and with Maul presumed dead, Sidious needed an apprentice in the interim. As such, he turned to the former [[Jedi Master]] [[Dooku]] to fill that role.

After landing his yacht ''[[Imperialis]]'' in the [[Plaintive Hand plateau]], Tashu ordered a detachment of six droids to begin excavating. The yacht soon left off-world but a local twelve-year-old boy named [[Gallius Rax|Galli]] sneaked aboard the ''Imperialis''. Sidious sensed his presence and gave the boy the choice of dying or serving him. Sidious then instructed Galli to return to the excavation site and guard it against any intruders. He stressed that intruders should not be allowed to taint the site and ordered Galli to kill them. Sidious then introduced himself on a first-name basis as Sheev.<ref name=\"Aftermath: Life Debt\" /><ref>[[Gallius Rax]]'s prelude and epilogue chapters in ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' occur roughly three decades before the events of the [[Battle of Jakku]], when the character was twelve years old.</ref>\n\nFor the next ten years, Galli guarded the Plaintive Hand excavation site. In [[20 BBY]], Sidious returned and invited the boy aboard the ''Imperialis'' this time as a guest of honor. By that stage, work on the [[Jakku Observatory]] had been completed. Using a game of [[Shah-tezh]] as an illustration, Sidious explained that his future Galactic Empire could not be allowed to outlive its [[Emperor]] should he die prematurely. To demonstrate his seriousness, Sidious [[Force choke]]d Galli. He tasked Galli with executing his secret [[Contingency]] plan and inducted the boy into Imperial service.<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref> Galli subsequently joined the [[Naval Intelligence Agency]] as a [[commander]]<ref name=\"Aftermath: Life Debt\" /> and adopted the name Gallius Rax.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n====Laying the foundations====\n{{Quote|You don't need guidance, Anakin.

On many occasions, the Chancellor attended the boy's training at the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] expressing appreciation for the progress reached by the young Padawan in lightsaber combat. He could notice that he was deeply conditioned by his emotions and he asked Master [[Mace Windu]] to send Skywalker to him, saying he could help with the boy's formation.<ref name=\"O&A I\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 1|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 1]]</ref> When Skywalker arrived in the company of his Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Palpatine asked to be accompanied by Skywalker for an errand in the [[Coruscant Underworld|lower levels]] of Coruscant. Dismissing Master Kenobi's reminder that Skywalker was not yet a Jedi and dangers could lie ahead, the Chancellor brought Skywalker to [[Level 2685]]. Both disguised as travellers, Palpatine told the youth that he himself frequents the area when his duties permitted it&mdash;to try to do some good. Eventually, the duo arrived at [[Club Kasakar]].<ref name=\"O&A II\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 2|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 2]]</ref>\n\nThere, Palpatine expressed some form of envy in the life of young Jedi Padawans, that was already decided from an early age, in difference with his political life, one of the troubling choices and difficult decisions. He also explained that the Club was full of Senators. In particular, he pointed out Senator [[Colandrus]], a [[Tarsunt]] who often went there for gambling. While the Tarsunt senator was betting at a game table, Palpatine said that Colandrus was corrupt, but there were no proofs of it. Inspired by that unflattering description Anakin used the [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] [[Force power|Jedi power]] to rig Colandrus' last [[Chance cube|dice]], making him lose large sums of [[Credit|money]]. Hearing the disguised Palpatine laugh at his misfortune, Colandrus sicced his [[bodyguard]] on him, but the Chancellor defused the situation by explaining that \"his son\" had just made a joke, and promised that they would leave at once. Still unconvinced, Colandrus nevertheless allowed the cloaked nuisances to go freely.<ref name=\"O&A III\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 3|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Sith_To_Be.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker's potential convinced Palpatine that the young Padawan could become the greatest of all the Jedi.]]\nOnce the duo returned back to the Chancellor's office, Palpatine \"apologized\" to Anakin for involving him in a Senate matter. Anakin said the Jedi could arrest Senator Colandrus, but Palpatine replied that the Jedi were not required to obey him because if they did, he would be like a dictator and that wasn't his wish. He also told the boy not to talk about what had happened to them with his masters and further asked if Anakin was happy in the temple. When the Padawan answered positively, Palpatine felt the truth of it through the Force. Eventually, Palpatine thanked him for his decisive role in the Battle of Naboo, and said there would always be a place for Anakin near him, and that he could make extraordinary use of a young man like Anakin.<ref name=\"O&A IV\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 4|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 4]]</ref>\n\nPalpatine continued to act as a confidant to Skywalker, providing guidance to the young Padawan who trained to become a true Jedi.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> Skywalker was grateful to Palpatine, and viewed the chancellor as a mentor as well as a friend.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> In private, Palpatine expressed to Skywalker his confidence in him, including his belief that Skywalker's power would eventually eclipse the combined strength of the Jedi Order, including Grand Master Yoda.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n====Separatist crisis====\n{{Quote|I love democracy.

Palpatine had the vote delayed and placed the senator under the protection of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, her old allies from the Battle of Naboo. After a second attempt on the senator's life was made, Skywalker was assigned to protect her back on her homeworld of Naboo. There the two secretly started to fall in love which, coupled with Skywalker's later [[Mission to rescue Shmi Skywalker Lars|discovery]] of his mother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi's]] death at the hands of [[Tusken Raider]]s on the planet Tatooine, would bring the young Jedi ever closer to the dark side of the force, and even more vulnerable to Sidious' deceptive machinations.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Parade.png|thumb|left|250px|Secession gave way to the Clone Wars, allowing Palpatine to create the Grand Army of the Republic with his emergency powers.]]\nHowever, when it was revealed that the Separatists were secretly building a battle droid army with the support of many commercial organizations, including the Trade Federation. Palpatine used the situation to have himself granted emergency powers from the Senate by Representative Jar Jar Binks. Palpatine feigned reluctance to accept this authority, promising to return it to the Senate once the crisis ended. His first act was to allow the use of the clone army, which was [[Mission to Kamino (Separatist Crisis)|discovered]] by Kenobi on Kamino, to counter the Separatist threat; this resulted in the [[First Battle of Geonosis|Battle of Geonosis]], which served as the opening salvo of the [[Clone Wars]]. After clone template Jango Fett was killed and the Separatist partners escaped the battle, Tyranus met with Sidious at the [[Inquisitorius Headquarters|Coruscant tower]] in [[The Works]] with not only good news that the war the Sith had been orchestrating had begun, but with plans for a Geonosian [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|superweapon]] that may be of use for their future Sith-led regime. Sidious was pleased with these turn of events, and later with the leaders of the Senate oversaw the new Republic army marching towards war, while Skywalker and Amidala secretly [[Wedding of Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala|wed]] on Naboo with their two droids, [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]], as sole witnesses<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> besides a local holy man who officiated the rite,<ref name=\"CL2016\" /> which Sidious would later use as an advantage to lure Skywalker to become his next apprentice.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Negotiations with the Hutts====\n{{Quote|Soon, the Jedi will not only be at war with you, Count, but the Hutt Clan as well.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Tyranus|audio=WithTheHuttClanAsWell-TCWf.ogg|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}\n[[File:Count_Dooku_speaks_with_Darth_Sidious.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious and Tyranus controlled both sides in the galactic conflict as Chancellor Palpatine and Count Dooku.]]\nAfter the Confederacy's Droid Army seized control of the major [[Hyperspace route|hyperspace lanes]], Sidious had Tyranus and his assassin [[Asajj Ventress]] kidnap the [[Hutt Clan]]s' [[Grand Hutt Council|Council]] leader, [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] son, [[Rotta]]. After he was taken to [[Teth]], Sidious contacted both Ventress and Tyranus. He assured them that the Jedi would be at war with the Hutts as well the Confederacy.<ref name=\"TCW film\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref>\n\nPalpatine then received a message from Jabba, asking for help in rescuing his son. Despite Master Windu's reservations about allying the Republic with the Hutt, Palpatine knew they need the Hutt's space lanes to move their troops. Despite General Grievous spreading the Republic forces thin, Windu told Palpatine that Skywalker and Kenobi could carry out the rescue. During the rescue, Palpatine learned that Jabba believed that the Jedi were behind his son's kidnapping and told Senator Amidala of this. Jabba refused to speak with him, so Amidala decided to speak with Jabba's uncle [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] at his [[Ziro's Palace|palace]], despite Palpatine's warning. Kenobi, Skywalker, and his new Padawan, [[Ahsoka Tano]] were able to return Rotta to his father and secure a treaty with the Hutts. Following the events, Sidious spoke with his apprentice about this setback. He assured Tyranus that the war was turning in their favor.<ref name=\"TCW film\" />\n\n====Gunray's capture====\n{{Quote|Gunray's capture could be a serious threat to us, my friend.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Tyranus|Cloak of Darkness}}\nPalpatine learned that Senator Amidala moved through enemy territory into the Outer Rim, causing him to contact her aboard her [[H-type Nubian yacht]]. Amidala explained that an old family friend, Senator Farr of [[Rodia]], had asked for her personally, as his people were starving. Palpatine claimed to understand, although he argued that she should have a clone trooper escort. However, Amidala had trust in diplomacy. After Representative Binks tried to talk to Palpatine, he caused C-3PO's chair to move, knocking the Gungan down and causing the ship to veer off course. Amidala was able to regain control, but Palpatine discreetly urged her to keep Binks out of the negotiations, which she agreed to.<ref name=\"Bombad Jedi\">{{TCW|Bombad Jedi}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sidious_Dooku_Talk_2.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious ordered Tyranus to retrieve Nute Gunray, not wanting the Jedi to learn of what he knew.]]\nYet once Amidala was planet-side, she learned Farr had joined the Separatists to help his people, and she was captured by Nute Gunray's battle droids. However, Binks helped disrupt the Separatist's plans and Farr decided to side with the Republic. Thanks to a message sent by C-3PO, the [[41st Elite Corps]] arrived on the planet and captured Gunray. Palpatine contacted them via hologram, stating that Amidala had brought Rodia's needs to his attention. The Chancellor had deployed a [[convoy]] of supply ships and stated that Gunray's capture was a major Republic victory.<ref name=\"Bombad Jedi\" />\n\nHowever, the secret Sith [[Lord]] saw the danger Nute Gunray's capture posed, as the viceroy would not last under the Jedi's questioning. Contacting Darth Tyranus, Sidious was informed by his apprentice that Asajj Ventress could infiltrate the Republic warship, allowing her to rescue or kill Gunray. While Sidious was apprehensive about using an agent who had previously failed them in the past, Tyranus argued that she was a skilled assassin. Ultimately, the master allowed his pupil to proceed in this plan; Ventress successfully [[Rescue on the Tranquility|rescued]] Nute Gunray, denying the Jedi and the Republic the opportunity to extract secret information from the Separatist leader, whilst also demonstrating her ability to handle a [[Star Destroyer]]'s contingent of clone troopers, a Jedi Padawan, and a Jedi Master all at once.<ref name=\"Cloak of Darkness\">{{TCW|Cloak of Darkness}}</ref>\n\n====Chancellor at war====\n{{Quote|With the final votes tallied, let it be known that the motion to stop the creation of more clone troops has failed, and the continued manufacturing of clone troopers shall proceed as scheduled.|Sheev Palpatine|Senate Murders}}\n[[File:PalpatineRepublicArmy.png|thumb|right|250px|As a result of the Clone Wars, the Republic became a militarized state under Chancellor Palpatine.]]\nAs the war got underway, Dooku [[Skirmish at Vanqor|crash-landed]] his ship on [[Vanqor]] and was captured by the [[Ohnaka Gang]].

The nanny droid told the Dark Lord that subjects rarely survive the procedure at a young age but Sidious said the risk was necessary and that if the procedure failed he would lose nothing. As the surgery was about to happen, an alert from a nanny droid told the Sith Lord of an incoming shuttle that was approaching and it did not belong to the bounty hunter.

Upon further investigation, Amidala found that many of the senators who voted in support have actually been blackmailed to do so. She also discovered that supporting the bill would mean bankrupting certain segments of the Republic such as their social programs, due to the Banking Clan's high interest rates. Pursued by assassins, Bail Organa, Onacondo Farr and Amidala continued attempting to oppose the bill with Amidala stepping up in front of the Senate. In her speech, she pointed out that passing the bill would harm the citizens it was supposedly attempting to protect. Her speech marshals loud respect and support from the Senate audience. Later, Palpatine expressed his displeasure to Mas Amedda, noting how the success of one individual's passionate voice can have over his power.

However, Amidala realized Farr's aide, [[Lolo Purs]], was the true culprit, and the Rodian was arrested.

Sidious proved himself to be not only a match for their combined strength but also superior, as after a prolonged duel, he separated the brothers by first bypassing Savage's defense and knocking him away with a kick and then force-pushed Maul, briefly knocking him out. Sidious then briefly toyed with Savage, not even bothering to engage, before he then began battling him again and soundly slayed Opress in single combat. Not bothering to prevent Maul from going to his brother, knowing it was too late for him to do anything to save Savage after Opress finally succumbed, Sidious taunted Maul again, reminding him of the ancient rules of the Sith and how Maul had been replaced before he then once again engaged his former apprentice.

Palpatine told Yoda to consult former Supreme Chancellor [[Finis Valorum]], since he was still a Senator at the time. Sidious then went to berate Tyranus via hologram over this loose end, ordering him to sort it out. Vexed by Tyranus' carelessness, Sidious [[Force choke]]d his apprentice, warning him to remember the price for failure. Dooku prevented Kenobi and Skywalker from learning who killed Sifo-Dyas, but they still deduced the Sith were responsible for the creation of the clone army.<ref name=\"TLO\" />\n\n====Yoda's journey to Moraband====\n{{Quote|Save him, Jedi?

Greeting his apprentice once he arrived, Sidious led Tyranus to the tower's ceremonial chamber. Exploiting Tyranus and Yoda's [[Force-bond]], Sidious used a [[Balc]] incantation to cast a [[dark illusion]] to ensnare the Jedi Master. Using Sifo-Dyas' visage, he offered to reveal his identity if he would join him, but Yoda refused. The illusion then made it seem that they were in The Works pursuing the Sith Lords with Anakin Skywalker and the [[501st Legion]]. Sidious dueled Yoda on the catwalks outside the tower, with Skywalker arriving outside shortly after. Sidious rendered Skywalker unconscious with [[Force lightning]] while he continued fighting Yoda. As the illusion unfolded, Yoda refused to sacrifice Skywalker to pursue Sidious, and instead demonstrated he was willing to sacrifice himself to save the Chosen One. Sidious's illusion faltered: the Jedi Master won. Defeated, Sidious stated that they would need more time to defeat the Jedi.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n====Business on Utapau====\nWhen he learned the otherwise unremarkable planet [[Utapau]] had produced a massive [[kyber crystal]], the world became of interest to Sidious, as he wanted the large crystal for his battle station project.<ref name=\"Helmet Collection 35\">{{HelmetCollectionCite|35|Highlights of the Saga|Escape from Utapau}}</ref> With the crystal in the hands of a [[Sugi]] [[Endente's arms dealing group|arms dealing group]], Dooku agreed to a sale, claiming he wanted the crystal for the Separatist Alliance.<ref name=\"In Search of the Crystal\">{{TCW|In Search of the Crystal}}</ref> Grievous himself arrived to oversee the deal, ultimately killing the Sugi leader, [[Endente]], and taking the crystal to his Separatist fleet.<ref name=\"Crisis\">{{TCW|Crystal Crisis}}</ref> However, after they had [[Mission to Utapau|arrived on Utapau]] to investigate the death of Jedi Master [[Tu-Anh]],<ref name=\"A Death on Utapau\">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref> Kenobi and Skywalker fought to stop the Separatist operation, pursuing the crystal into space and destroying it aboard Grievous's [[DH-Omni Support Vessel]].

Sidious and Grievous also arrived on the planet and [[Second Battle of Dathomir|attacked]] Maul and the Talzin-possessed Dooku. Talzin regained her physical body and fended off Sidious's lightning, sacrificing herself to allow her son to escape. Taking the opportunity, Grievous plunged two lightsabers into her body, eliminating the foe of Sidious. Despite Maul's escape, Sidious was satisfied that the [[Shadow Collective]] had been destroyed.<ref name=\"Darth Maul Four\">[[Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 4|''Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir'' 4]]</ref>\n\n====A Jedi renegade====\nLater, the Jedi sent [[Quinlan Vos]] to work with Ventress to kill Count Dooku. This mission was deemed Jedi business, so Palpatine was not informed. However, Skywalker was unsure if that was the correct decision, and he felt that the Jedi keeping secrets from the Chancellor was wrong. Eventually, aboard the Republic's [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Vigilance (Venator-class)|''Vigilance'']] in [[orbit]] of [[Christophsis]], Vos, who had fallen to the dark side and tasked himself with becoming Dooku's apprentice so as to discover Darth Sidious' identity, and Dooku, held in captivity of several clone troopers and Jedi, including Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, had enlisted the assistance of Asajj Ventress in their escape.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>\n\nThe trio, however, crash-landed onto Christophsis under Republic pursuit, with the Count of Serenno suffering grievous injuries. Having sought shelter in a hidden Confederacy fortress, Tyranus contacted a long-awaiting Darth Sidious within a hologram communications chamber in seek of help, yet not before Vos and Ventress slipped in. Tyranus was thus forced to introduce Quinlan Vos, presenting the former Jedi as his \"new assassin\" to Sidious, who had customarily hidden his facial features behind his dark cowl, whilst Ventress remained hidden in the shadows. After expressing disapproval with his apprentice's new employ, Darth Sidious listened to Tyranus' plea for an evacuation ship as a [[second battle of Christophsis]] ensued with Skywalker leading the ruthless Republic onslaught. Giving only a vague answer, Sidious ended the holo-communication as the [[Christophsis Separatist tower]] fell to Republic gunship fire. The battle resulted in an inevitable Separatist loss, and with Ventress' redemption through sacrificing herself for her lover, Quinlan Vos, Tyranus' \"new assassin\" chose to allow Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi take him back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for reassessment. Meanwhile, as the Jedi took Vos, a ship sent by Darth Sidious arrived to retrieve Tyranus, letting the Separatist leader return to safety.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n====Battle of Coruscant and death of Dooku====\n{{Quote|You did well, Anakin.

He then devised a plan for Palpatine to be captured and Anakin to rescue him and kill Darth Tyranus, in order to tempt Anakin to the dark side and replace Tyranus as his next apprentice. Sidious ordered Grievous to capture Palpatine and Dooku to hold him hostage. Grievous and Dooku, however, were unaware of Sidious's true intentions.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nDuring the [[Outer Rim Sieges]], Grievous commanded a [[Battle of Coruscant|massive invasion]] of Coruscant, accompanied by Dooku. While the Republic and Separatist fleets clashed above the planet, Grievous went to the ground in order to capture Palpatine  Shaak Ti and [[Roron Corobb|Roron Corrob]], along with a clone task force were sent to protect him. Corrob and the clones fell to Grievous, while Ti managed to fight further. Grievous took the upper hand by electrifying the Jedi Master with cables, knocking her unconscious in the process. Grievous took [[Shaak Ti's lightsaber|her lightsaber]] and fled with the captive Palpatine to the Separatist [[flagship]] ''[[Invisible Hand]]''.<ref name=\"Lightsabers\">''[[Star Wars Lightsabers: A Guide to Weapons of the Force]]''</ref>\n\nKenobi and Skywalker, who at the time were in the middle of [[Siege of Mandalore|making preparations to take]] Mandalore, were called upon to rescue him. After landing in the ''Invisible Hand''{{'s}} hangar, the two found Palpatine bound to a chair on the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]]. They were confronted by Dooku, who they entered a duel with. Dooku took out Kenobi with ease and then focused on Skywalker. They continued the duel until Skywalker cut off his hands. Disarmed and on his knees, Dooku was bested. Palpatine commended Skywalker on his accomplishment. However, he then betrayed Dooku by urging Anakin to kill him once he served his purpose. A horrified Dooku looked to Palpatine pleadingly, only to be met with another, more sinister urging. With one swift move, Count Dooku was beheaded. Anakin was conflicted on his actions but was comforted by Palpatine, who told him that it was a simple act of revenge in return for Dooku cutting off his arm, unaware that Sidious had manipulated him into doing so. Skywalker went to pick up the unconscious Kenobi, to which Palpatine pleaded with the Jedi to leave his master. His plea was denied, and the three began their descent to the hangar.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:R2AndPalpy-ROTS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Jedi mission to rescue Palpatine was a success, and the Republic claimed victory in the Battle of Coruscant.]]\nMeanwhile, the ''Invisible Hand'' was attacked by the [[Guarlara (Venator-class)|''Guarlara'']], with the former taking extensive damage and losing its position, momentarily falling towards that planet's surface. With the ship on its side, the three began running down an elevator shaft, only to lose their footing as the ''Invisible Hand'' regained its position. They managed to get out and to a hallway, where they were then captured in a ray shield. They were brought before Grievous in the control room, where R2-D2, who was also a captive, gave a distraction that allowed Kenobi and Skywalker to take control. With nowhere to run, Grievous broke open a window and found his way to the escape pods, which he activated as he fled. The ship then became caught in Coruscant's gravity well and began barreling towards the surface. Skywalker and Kenobi attempted to land it, but only managed to ease the crash. Following the crash, Palpatine and the Jedi were escorted to the Senate Building.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====The seduction of Anakin Skywalker====\n{{Quote|Soon I will have a ''new'' apprentice, one far younger and more powerful.|Darth Sidious, to Grievous|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\n[[File:Tragedy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious recounted the history of his late master as a Sith legend, leading Skywalker to drift ever closer to the dark side of the Force.]]\nSidious soon began preparing for the war's end. Sidious instructed Grievous to move the Separatists to Mustafar. Skywalker, who had just been hailed as a hero for killing Count Dooku and rescuing the Chancellor, began having visions of his wife dying in childbirth. Sidious decided to use that to his advantage. Throughout the next few rotations, their relationship kept growing. Ultimately, Palpatine appointed Skywalker to be his representative to the Jedi Council.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the Jedi began to distrust and resent the Chancellor's accumulating power and control. The Council, who was not happy with Skywalker's appointment by one not of their order, denied him the rank of \"Jedi Master.\" This turn of events simply furthered Sidious' plans. The Council, however, decided to use this appointment as a chance to spy on Palpatine. Skywalker, who felt insulted by that demand, regretfully agreed and began to devote his time to getting to know the Chancellor better. Some Jedi, such as Mace Windu, were concerned about their relationship, seeing that it could be dangerous putting the two together. Windu ultimately noted that the dark side of the Force surrounded the Chancellor.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nAt an opera show, Palpatine and Skywalker discussed the situation with Palpatine revealing to know that the Council wanted Skywalker to spy on him. At the same time, Skywalker, who was dealing with the fear of his wife's loss was beginning to distrust the Jedi Council. This allowed Sidious to orchestrate Skywalker's downfall; he claimed that the Jedi and the Sith were alike in nearly every way,<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> setting the stage for the young Jedi to switch sides while playing to his devotion to the Jedi ideology.<ref name=\"Certain POV 193\">{{InsiderCite|193|A Certain Point of View (Star Wars Insider)|A Certain Point of View}}</ref> Next, Palpatine told him the story of his master, \"Darth Plagueis the Wise.\" According to the story, Plagueis possessed such strength in the Force that he could use it to prevent the ones closest to him from certain death. Skywalker, enthralled by the story, wished to know more about this power, asking him if he himself could learn it with Palpatine stating that, though possible, such things could not be taught by members of the Order.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nAs the situation grew worse, Skywalker went to speak with the Chancellor regarding the [[Battle of Utapau]]. Anakin expressed his disappointment that he was not chosen for the assignment. Palpatine told Skywalker that the Council did not trust him and that the Jedi were plotting to take control of the Republic. Palpatine then revealed that he was trained in the ways of the Force, \"even the nature of the dark side.\" This led to Skywalker concluding that Palpatine himself, was the Sith Lord the Jedi were hunting down. With this, Palpatine told Skywalker that he would teach him to save his wife from death. Skywalker, who desired to kill him, went to the Jedi Council with this information.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Duel in the Chancellor's Office====\n{{Quote|In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.''\"<br />\"''Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?''\"<br />\"''The Senate will decide your fate.''\"<br />\"''I ''am'' the Senate.''\"<br />\"''Not yet.|Mace Windu and Darth Sidious|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\nMace Windu, after learning about Skywalker's claim went to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|confront]] the Chancellor along with fellow Jedi Council Masters [[Kit Fisto]], [[Agen Kolar]], as well as [[Saesee Tiin]]. Windu and the three other Jedi boldly ignited their lightsabers and declared that he was under arrest. Igniting his own crimson lightsaber, Sidious declared the four Jedi as traitors to the Republic. Letting out an inhuman wail of fury, he then lunged forward and slew Kolar and Tiin in mere [[second]]s, and Fisto slightly later, leaving Windu to face the Dark Lord alone. Sidious and Windu then engaged in a ferocious one-on-one duel. Though Sidious initially had the upper hand, Windu eventually disarmed him, knocked him to the floor and held him at blade point.\n\n[[File:SithTeachings-Convergence.png|thumb|right|250px|Darth Sidious bestows the name Darth Vader on his new apprentice.]]\nAnakin soon arrived after this and both sides tried to persuade him that the other was a traitor. Windu taunted Sidious in his defeat which prompted the Sith Lord to attempt to kill Windu with Force lightning, but Windu managed to deflect it back at Sidious, causing the Sith Lord's face to take on a hideously disfigured appearance in the process, due to the Dark Side energy emanating from the lightning. As a result of this, Sidious then switched his strategy to pretending to be a defenseless old man, dropping his lightning attack and proclaiming that he was too weak to carry on. Skywalker told Windu that Sidious had to stand trial, though Windu claimed that Sidious possessed far too much influence to be left alive, as he controlled both the courts and the senate. Deciding that his wife's survival was more important than his loyalty to the Jedi Order, Anakin intervened, cutting off Mace Windu's lightsaber hand and giving Sidious the opening to drop his feigned weakness and assault Windu with a full barrage of Force lightning, throwing him out the office window.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nSkywalker, although initially stunned by what he had done, ultimately viewed Windu's transgressions as the final act of Jedi hypocrisy that he would not tolerate, and knelt before the now-scarred Chancellor, agreeing to join the dark side on the condition that he was be shown how to save Amidala's life. Sidious bestowed on the young man the Sith name of Darth Vader, promising the young apprentice that together they would discover the hidden art of preventing death. Sidious informed Vader of his intention to purge the galaxy of all Jedi, claiming that the Order was a threat to the Senate as well as the security of the Republic. Sidious ordered Vader to [[Siege of the Jedi Temple|attack the Jedi Temple]] on Coruscant and then [[Mission to Mustafar|execute]] the [[Executive Separatist Council|Separatist leaders]] on Mustafar. He declared that the galaxy would then return to a state of peace under the rule of the Sith.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Order 66 and rise of the New Order====\n{{Quote|Commander Cody, the time has come.

Upon arriving at the [[Chancellor's working office|working office]] of the [[Chancellery Secretariat]], Yoda disposed of the pair of guardsmen by the entryway, surprising Sidious. Within moments, however, the Sith Lord had recollected himself, unleashing a barrage of force lightning at the Jedi Master after a brief exchange of acknowledgement between the two. Yoda quickly recovered and force pushed Sidious backwards. Yoda then engaged him in a duel when he refused to allow Sidious to escape. Sidious declared that Vader would become more powerful than both of them, while Yoda told Sidious that his faith in his nascent apprentice was a mistake, along with his faith in the dark side. The two then dueled in the Senate hall, and Sidious narrowly managed to gain the upper hand through the use of his Force powers by sending numerous Senate pods at the Jedi Master, which he closely dodged. Sidious then unleashed a torrent of Force lightning at Yoda, which he was able to redirect back on him. Yoda fled and was forced to go into exile, but the Emperor did not personally pursue him as he had other, more pressing matters to attend to.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Rescuing Vader====\n{{Quote|I sense Lord Vader is in danger.|Darth Sidious|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\nAs [[Imperial shock trooper]] of the [[Coruscant Guard]] arrived in the Senate Chamber following the battle, the Emperor stood with Mas Amedda on a Senatorial pod as they searched for the Jedi Master. However, they could not find any trace of a body. The Emperor had more pressing concerns however: he had sensed that Vader, far away on Mustafar, was in danger of being destroyed. He ordered the clones to double their search for Yoda, and that his shuttle be prepared to depart.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Let_The_Hate_Flow_AtG.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious traveled to Mustafar to retrieve his new apprentice, Darth Vader, who was defeated by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.]]\nThe Emperor made haste to Mustafar, accompanied by<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> a [[Thire's squad|squad]] of the best shock troopers under the authority of Commander [[CC-4477]] \"Thire.\"<ref name=\"HC 38\">{{HelmetCollectionCite|38|Helmets|Commander Thire}}</ref> On planet, he found that Vader had been dismembered, horrifically burned, and left for dead by Obi-Wan Kenobi after the conclusion of their duel. He ordered the clones accompanying him to prepare a medical capsule for his apprentice. As they left to obey his instructions, the Emperor crouched beside his fallen apprentice, determined to find a way to keep him alive.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nThe Emperor was keenly aware that, without Vader, the foundations of his newfound power would be badly shaken; he needed an apprentice capable of ensuring that his Empire would survive the inevitable challenges that would rise up against it. To make certain that Vader would be capable of remaining a powerful apprentice, the Emperor contacted the boldest scientists he could, those whose practices would have been frowned on by the Jedi and the Republic. Among these scientists was an expert in [[cybernetics]] named Doctor [[Cylo]].<ref name=\"Darth Vader 20\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 20|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 20]]</ref>\n\nThe Emperor brought Vader to the Grand Medical Facility, far above Coruscant's surface as a storm raged across the capital. A strenuous night, followed during which the scientists, their droids and their technology worked to save the critically-injured Vader before he died. The new Sith apprentice was kept awake for the whole procedure, feeling the pain that came with saving his life. Cylo and the other scientists designed a suit of [[Vader's armor|armor]] that would protect his weakened body and allow his scorched lungs to breathe. Cybernetic limbs were added to replace the legs and the arm that Kenobi had taken.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:VaderSidious-ROTS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Returning to Coruscant, Sidious had Vader rebuilt with cybernetic and life support technology.]]\nAfter what the Emperor would call a \"long night,\" Skywalker was surgically reconstructed as a cyborg and encased in the armor and mask that would forever hide away who he had once been from the galaxy. As the procedure ended and the Sith apprentice rose, the Emperor approached him. Vader's first query was to know whether or not his wife was safe. The Emperor told him that he had killed Amidala in his anger. This final loss sent Vader over the edge of pure wrath and anguish, completing his transition into the apprentice Sidious had spent decades grooming. In his rage, Vader used his new limbs to tear away the restraints that held him to the operating table and the Force to destroy the droids who had just saved his life, before stepping unsteadily onto his new legs and screaming his despair to the galaxy as a satisfied Sidious looked on with a devilish smile.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nVader then turned his rage onto the Emperor, throwing him into the wall of the operating room with the Force. He angrily berated his master for promising that he could save his wife from death. The Emperor conceded that he had failed him in that regard but countered that, with her death, Padm\u00e9 had given him something so much stronger: pain. This pain would fuel his power for decades and make him the dreaded Sith apprentice that Sidious had always coveted. It would also allow him to live. After a tense few moments, Vader released his master and proclaimed that he would live. Satisfied, the Emperor then assaulted Vader with [[Force lightning]] and warned him never to use the Force against him in such a way again, or he would finish what Kenobi would not.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 1\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 1]]</ref>\n\n====Search for Immortality====\nDuring the [[Imperial Era]], secure in power as Emperor of the galaxy, Sidious pursued his obsession with immortality, and mostly withdrew from the public eye to probe the secrets of the darkside and study his Sith arcana extensively to unlock the ability to live forever. He prepared the ancient Sith world of Exegol, constructing a base of power within the [[Sith Citadel]] located on the surface, planning to claim the ancient throne of Sith as his permanent seat of power. His loyal cult following, the [[Sith Eternal]], began to experiment with technology and genetic cloning science to expand his lifespan. Exegol was also home to his most promising experimentations within a vergence of the Force.<ref name=\"TSWB\" />\n\n====Destruction of the old====\n[[File:Thrawn-meets-the-Emperor.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious converted the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace, his official residence on Coruscant.]]\nAfter the creation of his Sith Empire, Sidious established himself in the old Jedi Temple on Coruscant, transforming it into the Imperial Palace. The Jedi had built the palace atop an ancient [[Shrine in the Depths|Sith shrine]], in order to neutralize and cap the dark power that sprang from its depths. Sidious entrusted the reopening and restoration of the ancient temple to droids under the supervision of [[11-4D]], a protocol droid inherited from Darth Plagueis.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> During the early days of the Empire, making a rare public address, Sidious claimed the Empire would do whatever was needed to ensure a lasting reconciliation now that the Clone Wars had ended.<ref name=\"Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel\" />\n\nDuring his rule, Sidious sent explorers to unmapped regions of the galaxy to search for the source of the dark side, believing it lay there. These explorers built [[Laboratory|labs]] on distant moons and asteroids. As part of his planned Contingency, Sidious had Imperial scouts explore the Unknown Regions while also utilizing extensive resources to seed laboratories, shipyards, and observatories within that same region.

Tarkin went on to become Governor of [[Eriadu]] and one of the Republic's foremost military leaders during the Clone Wars. Sidious had learned of Tarkin's upbringing on Eriadu, where he had been trained in harsh conditions through a brutal initiation in the wild [[Carrion Plateau]] of his homeworld. Tarkin had been taught to hunt savage creatures and emerged from his training with the belief that only the brutal application of the law and the fear of force could keep beings in line with a central galactic government. Although Tarkin lacked Force-sensitivity, Sidious identified him as one whose mindset was very close to that of the Sith.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\n====Mission to Ryloth====\n=====An official visit=====\n[[File:Imperial_Lessu.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious and Vader visited Ryloth, the Twi'lek homeworld that the Empire occupied after the Clone Wars.]]\n[[14 BBY|Five years]] after the end of the Clone Wars, [[Cham Syndulla]], a war hero who liberated [[Ryloth]] from the Separatist forces during the war, organized and led the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] in order to liberate his homeworld once again, this time from an Imperial military occupation. Sidious summoned the Senator of Ryloth, [[Orn Free Taa]], in order to incorporate the senator into his plan to eradicate the \"terrorists.\" He ordered the [[Twi'lek]] to accompany him and his right-hand man, Darth Vader, for an official [[Mission to Ryloth|visit]] to Ryloth. Once Sidious dismissed Taa, Vader asked him why he couldn't simply wipe out the Senator along with his entire staff, in which the two Sith suspected there were one or more traitors, who provided aid to the terrorist movement. But the Emperor wished to find the roots of the treachery, eliminate them and make of it an example for the entire galaxy. Eventually, he ordered Vader to inform the [[Moff]] of Ryloth, [[Delian Mors]], of the arrival of Senator Orn Free Taa, but not of the two of them.<ref name=\"LOTS\">''[[Lords of the Sith]]''</ref>\n\n=====Assassination attempt on the ''Defiance''=====\n[[File:EmperorAmused-Orientation.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious was the target of assassination plots throughout his reign.]]\nWhile on the way to Ryloth aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Perilous]]'', Sidious instructed the ship to stop at the [[Denon]] [[Denon system|system]] for a meeting on the training cruiser [[Obedience|''Defiance'']] with several [[Imperial Navy]] chiefs to discuss a realignment of the Imperial Naval Academy. Sidious ordered Darth Vader to oversee training exercises conducted by [[Commandant]] [[Pell Baylo]] while the Emperor was in his meeting with the naval chiefs. During one such exercise, Baylo set a [[hyperspace]] route that would have crashed the ''Defiance'' into [[Christophsis' sun]]. [[Cadet]] [[Rae Sloane]] and Darth Vader uncovered this assassination attempt and redirected the ''Defiance''. Baylo confronted the Emperor, accusing the Galactic Empire of being a hostile force that had taken over the Galactic Republic. Vader killed Baylo, which upset Sidious, who wanted Baylo to suffer as the Navy becomes something he hated and watch as the ''Defiance'' was decommissioned and turned into \"cafeteria trays.\" Instead, the ''Defiance'' was renamed ''Obedience'' as a final jab at Baylo and a not-so-subtle reminder toward Vader to remember his place, and Sidious and Vader re-boarded the ''Perilous'' and continued on their way to Ryloth.<ref name=\"Orientation\">{{InsiderCite|157|Orientation}}</ref>\n\n=====The fall of the ''Perilous''=====\n[[File:VadersJusticeJakeMurraySWTCG.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vader thwarted the assassination attempt against his master.]]\nThe two Sith and Senator Taa came to the [[Ryloth system]] aboard ''Perilous''. When the ship exited from the hyperspace, they found themselves in the middle of a minefield: Syndulla was waiting for them. The Twi'lek wished to eliminate them to strike at the heart of the Empire. However, Sidious was unperturbed by the ambush, having evidently foreseen such an occurrence. When the shields were overwhelmed, Sidious remained on the bridge, while Vader took off with his fighter leading a squadron to deal with a swarm of [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|vulture droids]]. The former Separatist fighters released thousands of explosive [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droids]] which further damaged the Star Destroyer. Vader returned aboard the ''Perilous'' where he met the Emperor and Senator Taa after finding that the Emperor's personal shuttle had been destroyed in the attack. Because he suspected there was a traitor in the Senator's staff, Sidious ordered to isolate them in their own quarters and deny them access to any communications equipment.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nIn the meantime, a Twi'lek task force reached the ship disguised as a repair team and placed explosive charges in the [[hyperdrive]] chamber, to trigger a chain reaction. After discovering the sabotage and realizing that the ship was doomed, Vader contacted the Emperor. The Emperor informed Vader that he had prepared a second shuttle either as a contingency or because he had foreseen the destruction of the first shuttle and told Vader to meet him there. However, Vader delayed his arrival by a few minutes in an attempt to find and eliminate the saboteurs. The Twi'lek rebels just barely managed to escape, and so Vader hurried to the Emperor's shuttle, which departed as soon as Vader was aboard. A few minutes later, the ''Perilous'' exploded. Once in space, the fugitive task force searched for the Imperial shuttle and caught up with it. Vader Force-choked the resistance pilot of the pursuing ship through the shuttle viewport. In a desperate attempt to get free from Vader's grasp and to kill both him and the Emperor, the Twi'leks rammed the stolen starship into the Imperial shuttle, critically damaging the latter. Vader attempted to regain control of the shuttle while Sidious remembered they had already been in situations like this. Thanks to the piloting skills of Vader the shuttle crash-landed on Ryloth's surface, in the middle of a forest.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n=====Isolated on the planet=====\n{{Quote|We are all of us, always being tested, my friend. Tests make us stronger, and strength is power, and power is the ''point''. We must pass all the tests we face&hellip; Or die in the effort.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|Lords of the Sith}}\n[[File:Imperial_Royal_Guards_Unit_Expansion_art.png|thumb|right|224px|Sidious and Vader were stranded on Ryloth with only a few Royal Guards.]]\nOnce on the planet surface, Sidious noted with mild annoyance that the landing had been far beneath what he knew Vader to be capable of and that Vader's lapse had left four corpses in the rear compartment of the shuttle. Vader admitted to having been distracted by thoughts of his past and attempted to dismiss it as nothing. Sidious however, was unconvinced, though he shelved the matter and proceeded with Vader into the rear compartment. There, three of the shuttle's occupants, [[Sergeant]] [[Erstin Deez]], his captain, and another member of the [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Guard]] had survived the crash, though one was badly injured and unconscious. Vader noted with mild surprise that the Emperor appeared to have been wrong; there were only three corpses in the compartment. One of the conscious guards noted that his injured comrade had not strapped himself in during the landing, and as a result had been thrown about the compartment when the ship had crashed. However the Emperor, seemingly having known about the guard, had him executed for his stupidity, leaving the fourth corpse.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nThe survivors exited in the night, and while the two guards who survived were checking the survival kits, Vader asked his master if he was testing him. Sidious answered they were always being tested, and they must pass all tests to gain strength and power. Meanwhile, the guards had activated the generator and the communication array to call for help. At that moment the Sith sensed that two Twi'lek ships were approaching and prepared themselves for a confrontation. The Twi'lek rebel's ships fired upon them, while Vader, immersed in the Force, deflected the laser beams with [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|his lightsaber]].<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nThe captain suggested to take cover in the woods, but the Emperor refused and instead, removed his cloak, and ignited his lightsaber. The two Sith spun their red blades, turning every shot back at the ships. When the enemy ships engines were hit and began to explode in flames and smoke, Sidious unleashed a bolt of Force lightning on their hulls and then, with the Force, drove one of the ships to the ground, while Vader did the same with the other. The two freighters exploded, and Vader sent Deez to check for survivors. They realized the rebels had jammed the communication network and that they were hunting for them.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n=====Hunted=====\n[[File:Lylek-SWGA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious fended off a horde of lyleks with Vader's help.]]\nThey walked for a long time into the depths of the forest. Sidious went forward in the darkness seeing through the Force while testing Vader's loyalty once again until he decided to stop for a while. While the guards were eating, the two Sith began to meditate. The Emperor sensed his apprentice's murderous feelings towards him. When Vader ended his meditation, Sidious told him what he had sensed, but the former Jedi pledged his loyalty to his Sith Master. At that moment, the guards, whom the Emperor had sent away, had returned, pursued by a horde of [[lylek]]s. The Emperor remained calm, sending torrents of Force lightning against the predators, and began to advance back-to-back with Vader, their lightsabers ignited.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nWhile Vader and the guardsmen held back the advancing lyleks with their weapons, Sidious used the Force to topple trees over the advancing lylek horde. Through the Force, Sidious sensed a tunnel a hundred meters away. The four retreated into the tunnel with the lyleks in pursuit. This tunnel turned out to be the home of the lylek horde, and the four Imperials were forced to fight through hundreds of the creatures. The guards used their blasters and [[grenade]]s while the two Sith Lords used the Force and their lightsabers to fight through the horde.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nAs they waded deeper into the cave, Sidious realized that the lyleks were herding the intruders towards their queen. At Vader's instigation, the four resolved to kill all their opponents with the Emperor activating his red blade. After a fierce battle with the lyleks, Sidious and Vader found themselves back to back. When Sidious asked his apprentice whether he had ever toyed with the idea of letting his Emperor die to fulfill his own ambitions, Vader admitted he had entertained such thoughts but reassured his master it was only for a moment. Sidious accepted Vader's loyalty and the two joined forces to tackle the lylek queen.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nFollowing a savage battle, Vader managed to kill the queen; scattering the remaining lyleks. However, the royal guard captain was killed, leaving only Sidious, Vader, and Sergeant Deez. Based on their battle with the lyleks, master and apprentice quickly surmised that Cham and his rebels were trying to kill them to bring about the Empire's destruction. Having triumphed over the lylek horde, the three Imperials found an opening at the end of the tunnel which led back to the forest.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n=====Death and fate=====\n[[File:Drua_s_village.jpg|thumb|right|200px|On Sidious' order, Vader slaughtered a village of  Twi'leks that provided them with shelter.]]\nWhile Sidious and his companions were traveling through the forest, they encountered a young Twi'lek girl named [[Drua]]. Sidious made a move to kill her, but Vader blocked his master's death blow and convinced Sidious that she could lead them to a settlement where they could contact reinforcements. Drua led them to [[Drua's Village|her village]], which was home to escaped Twi'lek slaves. When the village head [[Narmn]] asked for their identities, Sidious introduced himself, Vader, and Deez as \"Krataa,\" \"Irluuk,\" and the Sergeant. Sidious and Vader alone knew that their pseudonyms stood for \"death\" and \"fate.\"<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nSidious warned Vader that his act of mercy towards Drua would cost both her and her fellow villagers their lives. Vader then managed to win over the villagers by offering to repair an ancient communications device. Once Vader had fixed the machine, Sidious ordered Deez to contact Moff Mors; whom he knew to be loyal. After re-establishing contact with the two Sith Lords, Mors took steps to eliminate the Imperial [[Treason|traitor]] [[Colonel]] [[Belkor Dray]], who was secretly aiding Cham's rebels. She foiled Belkor's plot to order V-wing fighters to strike Drua's Village and the massed Free Ryloth forces in a nearby quarry. After executing Belkor, Moff Mors sent her forces to rendezvous with Sidious and Vader at the Twi'lek village.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n[[File:Lords_of_the_Sith_art.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Empire crushed the Ryloth insurgency under the leadership of the Sith.]]\nCham's forces, unwilling to harm the villagers, fired warning shots so that the villagers would flee the scene of the upcoming battle. The villagers reacted by fleeing to a nearby mine shaft, a sanctuary in time of danger. However, Sidious, Vader, and Deez stood their ground at the center of the village. Before Cham's forces could launch their attack, Moff Mors' forces arrived in two transport vessels and trapped the rebel fighters. With many of the Free Ryloth fighters killed, Cham narrowly managed to avoid capture at the hands of Vader. Under the orders of Sidious, Mors's Imperial forces massacred the surviving Free Ryloth fighters. Following a brief exchange with Cham's lieutenant [[Isval]], Sidious ordered Vader to execute her and then afterward, the surviving Twi'lek villagers hiding in the mine shaft as well, in order not to leave any witnesses. After a brief moment of hesitation, Vader complied with his master's orders and massacred the villagers.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n====Berch Teller's campaign====\nBy 14 BBY,<ref name=\"Tarkin date\">{{TarkinDate}}</ref> Sidious had placed Moff Wilhuff Tarkin in charge of the secret [[Project Stardust|Death Star project]]. The battle moon was being constructed above Geonosis and was supplied by a series of marshaling stations. The Empire faced a new threat in the form of [[Berch Teller]], a former [[Republic Intelligence]] agent who opposed the Empire. He led a [[Berch Teller's rebel cell|rebel cell]] consisting of survivors and witnesses of the [[Antar Atrocity]], a mass crackdown on [[Antar 4]] following the Clone Wars that had seen the killing of innocent [[Gotal]] and [[Koorivar]] loyalists. Teller had a special animus for Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity. He was secretly aided and equipped by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Dodd Rancit]], the Director of the Naval Intelligence Agency and a rival of Tarkin.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\n[[File:Mission_to_Murkhana.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tarkin and Vader worked together in service to the Emperor.]]\nFollowing Teller's [[Attack on Sentinel Base|attack]] on [[Sentinel Base]], the Emperor convened a meeting of his [[Ruling Council]] to discuss the discovery of a cache of communications jammers on the planet [[Murkhana]]. The [[Imperial Security Bureau]] had purportedly discovered the cache and feared that dissidents were planning to disrupt the Imperial [[HoloNet]]; echoing the Separatist [[Shadowfeed]] broadcasts during the Clone Wars. The Emperor dispatched both Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader to [[Mission to Murkhana|investigate]] the matter. However, this played into Teller's hands and allowed the insurgents to steal Tarkin's corvette ''[[Carrion Spike]]'', which they intended to turn into a symbol of resistance against the Empire.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nAfter being briefed about the theft of the ''Carrion Spike'', Vice Admiral Rancit suggested that the ship's thieves were the same people who attacked Sentinel Base earlier. In response, the Emperor ordered Rancit to divert Imperial forces in the [[Belderone system]] to aid Tarkin and Lord Vader. While Tarkin and Vader pursued the insurgents, the Emperor chaired another meeting of the Ruling Council. During the meeting, Rancit advocated diverting more Imperial forces to reinforcing Imperial facilities across the [[Perlemian Trade Route]] and [[Hydian Way]]. The Council also learned that Teller' insurgents had [[Attack on Lucazec|attacked]] the [[Tagge Corporation|TaggeCo]] mining facilities on [[Lucazec]] and were transmitting [[holovid]]s of their attacks on the HoloNet.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\n[[File:Grand_Vizier_Amedda.png|thumb|left|250px|Having supported Sidious' rise to power, Mas Amedda secured his position in the New Order as the Emperor's Grand Vizier.]]\nFollowing a [[Battle in the Phindar system|skirmish]] in the [[Phindar system]] between Imperial forces and the stolen ''Carrion Spike'', Rancit convinced the Emperor to deploy [[interdictor vessel]]s against the insurgents. Grand Vizier Amedda then informed the Emperor that the Murkhana communications jammers had been discovered by an ISB asset tasked with investigating the find by his case officer. Acting on this information, Sidious interrogated the Koorivar ISB asset [[Bracchia]] and his case officer [[Stellan]], who revealed that they had been tipped about the discovery by Naval Intelligence. After viewing the holovid, the Emperor determined that the communications cache had been planted by a high&ndash;level Imperial official who was aiding the insurgents.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Lord Vader discovered that Rancit was the Imperial traitor and executed him. While Tarkin led Imperial forces against Teller's insurgents in a [[Battle near the Gulf of Tatooine|space battle]] near the [[Gulf of Tatooine]], Darth Sidious mediated on his quest for galactic dominance. Following the defeat of Teller's insurgency, Tarkin and Vader spent the next three weeks hunting down Teller's collaborators and contacts in a ruthless crackdown. The two briefed the Emperor, who appointed Tarkin as [[Grand Moff]] and [[Governor]] of the Outer Rim Territories. The Emperor also reshuffled the Ruling Council in the wake of Rancit's execution. He also folded Naval Intelligence back into [[Imperial Intelligence]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nBy 14 BBY,<ref name=\"Fallen Order date note\">The events of ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'' take place about five [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Mission to Mustafar|end]] of the [[Clone Wars]], which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates to [[19 BBY]].

The project saw Imperial mining begin on Zeffo to locate artifacts.

This came to a head when the crew of the ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer ''[[Strikefast]]'', under the command of Captain [[Voss Parck]], encountered the [[Chiss]] known as [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] in [[Wild Space]]. Many years earlier, Anakin Skywalker told Palpatine of this alien and how they worked together. This alien claimed to have a great deal of knowledge on the Unknown Regions. Thrawn was then brought before the Emperor on Coruscant in order to be questioned. Thrawn told the Emperor of threats lurking within the Unknown Regions and how they might one day find the Empire and offered his military skills. The Emperor then deduced that Thrawn's intentions were to help protect his people from these threats. Thrawn assured the Emperor that his allegiance would be to the Empire. Thrawn then revealed that he had known Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, thus proving who he was to the Emperor.<ref name=\"Thrawn\">[[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']]</ref>\n\nFor their service, the Emperor promised Captain Parck and his crew rewards. Thrawn however, requested that his translator [[Eli N. Vanto|Eli Vanto]] stay with him. The Emperor then asked Thrawn to walk with him outside. In his personal garden, the Emperor told the Chiss of his interest in the Unknown Regions. Thrawn then warned that there was great danger to be found there, however, he assured the Emperor that he would share his knowledge of the Unknown Regions. The Emperor ordered that Eli Vanto would be transferred to Thrawn's side and that they would both undergo training at the [[Royal Imperial Academy]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====A new threat====\n[[File:Inquisitorius_Vader_Comic.png|thumb|left|260px|Darth Vader and the Grand Inquisitor led a unit of Jedi hunters, known as the Inquisitorius, in the Emperor's name.]]\nWith the Jedi mostly defeated, Sidious felt secure behind his huge galactic military and dominion over most of the known galaxy. Despite this, remaining Separatist holdouts and surviving Jedi would gnaw at his confidence of the longevity of his new Empire. Seeking to secure the center, the Emperor supported mass military excursions into the Outer Rim Territories in an effort to bring more systems under his fold. With his ultimate goal of bending reality into something of his own creation, an omnipotent Empire would allow all the galaxy's inhabitants to be held in his dark embrace.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> Despite the Jedi being all but extinct, Force-sensitive children were still being born across the galaxy. In an effort to combat this threat, Sidious created the [[Inquisitorius]] composed of [[dark side adept]]s and commanded his apprentice, Lord Vader, to contact a [[The Grand Inquisitor|Pau'an Inquisitor]] to hunt them down and destroy them if they did not serve the Empire.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref>\n\nDuring Vader's hunt for the [[Hidden Hand]], the Emperor contacted his apprentice through a hologram, expressing his disappointment in his failure to track down the criminal syndicate.

Vader informed his master that he had discovered that his former Jedi apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, still lived. The Emperor was pleased with the news that Tano possibly knew the location of other hidden Jedi, and capturing her would allow the Empire to find them and destroy them before they became threats. Although Vader was more interested in finding his former Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Emperor told his apprentice to have patience and to send an Inquisitor to hunt down Tano and the other Jedi discovered on Lothal.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>\n\n=====Thrawn's campaign against the rebellion=====\nIn [[2 BBY]],<ref name=\"Dawn of Rebellion date\">''[[Dawn of Rebellion]]'' dates the events of ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]'' seventeen years after the end of the [[Clone Wars]], which ''Star Wars: Galactic Atlas'' dates to [[19 BBY]]; therefore, the events of ''Steps Into Shadow'' must take place in [[2 BBY]].</ref> the Emperor promoted the Chiss Imperial Navy officer Thrawn to the position of [[Grand Admiral]] for his role in [[Batonn insurgency|suppressing]] the [[Batonn insurgents|rebel insurgency]] in the [[Batonn sector]].<ref name=\"Steps Into Shadow\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref> During the promotion however, Thrawn questioned Sidious on the practicality of the [[Death Star]].

As a result, Mon Mothma was designated a traitor and Imperial forces were dispatched to hunt her down.

Sometime thereafter, the Emperor was contacted by Hydan, who informed him that they had reached the roots of the temple and uncovered a [[Painting of the Mortis gods|mural of the Mortis gods]], which was reminiscent of art and iconography found at the former temple on [[Coruscant]]. The Emperor told Hydan that he had sensed that the death of [[Kanan Jarrus]] had altered the fate of Lothal.

The Emperor taunted them through the portal and unleashed his power against them, which they were able to hold back. He then caught Bridger's leg and pulled him so that he could get through the portal. However, before he could get through the portal to enter the realm, Tano cut the [[Fiery energy|fiery]] [[lasso]].

After confirming with Thrawn that Savit had in fact been a traitor, the Emperor turned the topic of discussion to the Chiss officer's loyalties, though Thrawn insisted that his work with the Ascendancy was not treason. Thrawn admitted that the Grysks were primarily a threat to his own people, but he argued that they had taken an interest in the Empire and could want control of the Death Star, a possibility that Sidious instantly denied, telling Thrawn that neither the Grysks nor the Chiss would control his station. Thrawn denied seeking the battle station for his people and instead said he would fight against such a situation, but Sidious, understanding that a servant who held divided loyalties was not an asset, still questioned Thrawn's true loyalties.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\">''[[Thrawn: Treason]]''</ref>\n\nPondering Thrawn's loyalties, the Ascendancy, and the threat of the Grysks, Sidious wondered if Thrawn was correct, contemplating that an alliance between the Empire and the Ascendancy could be useful. However, in such a case, Sidious wanted control of both governments and pondered if Thrawn could be manipulated or persuaded into betraying the Chiss. Deciding such a possibility required additional meditation and turning his attention to a more urgent matter, that of the Lothal rebels, Sidious informed Thrawn that he was sending instructions for a chamber to be built aboard the ''[[Chimaera]]''. He ordered Thrawn to put down the rebel insurgency on Lothal and bring Bridger to the chamber,<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" /> which was a portion of the Lothal Jedi Temple he wanted brought aboard \"stone by stone.\"<ref name=\"FRAF\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref> Leaving Thrawn to carry out his duties, he gave the Grand Admiral one last order; once the [[Liberation of Lothal|battle at Lothal]] was over, he was to return to Coruscant so they could have a \"long talk.\"<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n[[File:Palpatine_family-reunion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A disguised Darth Sidious sought to use the Jedi Ezra Bridger to gain access to the World Between Worlds.]]\nFulfilling his orders,<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" /> Thrawn brought Bridger aboard the ''Chimaera'' when, in order to stop the Chiss officer from bombarding Lothal's [[Capital City]], the young Jedi surrendered himself to the Empire. After the officer and the Padawan talked about the fate of the Jedi and Lothal, Thrawn brought Ezra to the room that contained the temple portion, bringing Bridger face-to-face with the Galactic Emperor. Since the Emperor was off-world, he used a [[hologram]] projection to present himself in his more benevolent, pre-scarred form. Sidious then ordered Thrawn to leave the room, leaving him alone with Bridger and the temple fragment.<ref name=\"FRAF\" />\n\nIn an attempt to get Ezra to unlock the [[portal]] to the World Between Worlds, Sidious tried to tempt Ezra with the opportunity of reuniting with his deceased parents. Ezra, however, recalling his earlier lesson in the World Between Worlds, decided to reject this offer, knowing he had a family and then proceeded to pull down the Temple into rubble. This caused the Emperor's hologram projection to shift from his benevolent persona to his true form. With his plan in tatters, the Emperor ordered three members of the Royal Guard and three stormtroopers to enter the room and execute Ezra. However, after Sidious deactivated his hologram, Bridger was able to use the Force to crush the soldiers with rubble and escaped. Ultimately making his way to the bridge of the ''Chimaera'', Bridger, having previously ordered his ally [[Mart Mattin]] to summon a pod of [[Purrgil]] with [[Frequency Zero]], successfully liberated his homeworld from the Empire, as the creatures defeated the blockade in orbit and proceeded to take hold of the ''Chimaera'', dragging it, Thrawn, the rest of the crew, and him into hyperspace.

This loss, as the space station neared completion, was a bitter, and potentially fatal, blow to the Emperor's long-term plans. In order to deal with the problem, Sidious sent Vader to find the Death Star plans.<ref name=\"Episode IV\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'' Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref>\n\nVader destroyed the rebel flagship and much of the rebel fleet. However, the plans had escaped aboard the ''Tantive IV'', a CR90 Corvette, in the hands of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], the Imperial Senator for Alderaan and a suspected Rebel sympathizer. Vader soon trapped the corvette over Tatooine, boarding the ship and taking the Princess as a hostage. Although Vader failed to acquire the plans, he arrested Organa as a traitor and, as such, provided Sidious with the excuse he needed to dissolve the [[Imperial Senate]]. One of the last remnants of the Galactic Republic, Sidious had always planned to remove it but he needed to wait for the Death Star to be completed so that order could be maintained through fear instead of representation in the Senate. With the space station nearly completed and a Senator accused of supporting the rebellion, Sidious ordered the dissolution of the Senate. Legislative power was transferred to regional governors and select members of the [[Imperial Military|Imperial military]], such as Sidious's ally, Grand Moff Tarkin, allowing the Emperor to gain complete control over the Empire with no checks to his power.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref>\n\n====The New Order in peril====\n{{Quote|We kept the skeleton of the Republic for nearly twenty years while the Death Star was constructed.

As the Death Star was about to fire, Sidious sensed a disturbance in the Force, merely a blink from his point of view. In that moment, the Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker launched his proton torpedoes, succeeding in destroying the Death Star, killing Tarkin and most of the Empire's high-ranking officers, while also leaving Sidious concerned of the pilot's connection to the Force.<ref name=\"Disturbance\">{{Shortstory|story=Disturbance|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\nThe only survivors were Sidious's apprentice, Darth Vader, who had failed to defend the space station and General [[Cassio Tagge]], who had been sent to investigate Princess Leia Organa's claims about an active Rebel base on Dantooine. The Rebels' victory at Yavin was followed by another [[Assault on Cymoon|victory]] on [[Cymoon 1]], where a Rebel team destroyed the Empire's main production facility, [[Weapons Factory Alpha]]. Several other assaults by Rebel forces, such as the bombing of a supply base on [[Imdaar]] and the shipyards at [[Kuat]], harassed the Empire in the weeks following the Death Star's destruction. In addition, the aftermath of the Death Star's destruction saw a rise in pirate activity against Imperial supply convoys as the galactic government was no longer seen as invulnerable. The Empire's hold over vital worlds also began to slip; one of the worlds which began to question Imperial domination was the mining world of [[Shu-Torun]]. Ruled by a mercantile nobility called the [[ore-duke]]s, Shu-Torun provided important materials the Empire required for its construction projects, including the development of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], and the Emperor constantly demanded higher tithes, especially in the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin. Opposing this unsustainable increase, the Ore-dukes convinced their aged [[Unidentified King of Shu-Torun|King]] to rebel against the Empire.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" /><ref name=\":Star Wars 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref><ref name=\"Darth Vader 2\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 2|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 2]]</ref><ref name=\"Darth Vader Annual 1\">[[Darth Vader Annual 1|''Darth Vader Annual'' 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Palpatine_Vader_agent.jpg|thumb|left|320px|In the wake of Darth Vader's failures, Sidious opted to test his apprentice, withholding information about an elusive ally of the Empire.]]\nDetermined to prevent the destruction of his Empire, Sidious reorganized Imperial High Command by appointing General Tagge as [[Grand General]] with command of all military matters. Tagge had argued against the strategy of having the Death Star as the Imperial military's sole weapon, believing that the military was all that was needed to safeguard the Empire and that depending on a single weapon was inviting catastrophe. Vader, who had failed to protect either the Death Star or Cymoon 1, was demoted and ordered to serve under Tagge as the Grand General saw fit. The Emperor gave orders that the military was to focus its attention on the conquest of the Outer Rim until the time when the second Death Star was completed. Tagge and Vader begun targeting the pirates for destruction as well as cracking down on criminal elements which had gone unchecked in the past, such as the [[Son-tuul Pride]].<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" /><ref name=\"Darth Vader 2\" /><ref name=\"Darth Vader 7\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 7]]</ref>\n\nThe only ones spared the Empire's wrath were the [[Hutt]]s, who had entered into an alliance with the Empire. Needing raw materials for Imperial military production and knowing that the Hutts could provide them for the right price, Sidious [[Assault on Cymoon#Aftermath|sent]] Vader to Tatooine to negotiate an agreement with Jabba for their support in exchange for the Hutts being allowed to maintain their power base in the Outer Rim and the underworld. The destruction of competitors, such as the Son-tuul Pride, also allowed the Hutts to profit from the alliance as their position in the underworld fell to them.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 7\" />\n\nWhen Shu-Torun rose up in [[War on Shu-Torun|open rebellion]] against the Empire following Darth Vader's brutal suppression of an assassination attempt made against him by the King, Sidious sent his apprentice back to the mining world with a large military force at his command.

One of the specialists who had saved Vader's life after sustaining his fatal injuries on Mustafar, Sidious had kept him on and funded his research into upgrading organic species into cybernetically-enhanced subjects. Cylo believed that organisms could only survive by adapting with technology, and eliminating weaknesses. He also believed that in the new world he foresaw, the Force would be rendered obsolete. Although Sidious dismissed these thoughts by saying that everything was of the Force, he was curious to see what these scientists could do unconstrained by the presence of the Old Republic or the Jedi.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 20\" /><ref name=\"Darth Vader 5\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 5|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 5]]</ref><ref name=\"Vader 6\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 6|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 6]]</ref>\n\n[[File:StarWarsDarthVader20.jpg|thumb|left|300x330px|More tests laid for Vader in the tumultuous time of the Galactic Civil War, as he struggled under his manipulative Sith Master, Darth Sidious.]]\nDuring the twenty years which had passed since the end of the Clone Wars, Cylo had worked to create several [[Whale-ship|subjects]] which possessed the best genetic and cybernetic upgrades that he could provide, preparing them as potential enforcers for the Empire. With Vader's disgrace clear and the Emperor's need for strong elements to prevent further damage being done to the Empire, Cylo suggested that he replace his apprentice with one of his subjects. Vader's role would be reduced to a ceremonial one, while the doctor's subjects would enforce Sidious's will throughout the galaxy. Intrigued by Cylo's proposition, Sidious agreed to provide his subjects with a chance to impress him.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 5\" /><ref name=\"Vader 6\" />\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to the scientist, the Emperor had come to believe that Cylo had grown too powerful as a result of his involvement with the Tarkin Initiative. He could do nothing about it because of the doctor's connection with several of the Empire's greatest scientific minds, and removing him could cause a splint among them. When Cylo presented him his plan, however, Sidious knew that he could cause him to overplay his hand which would make him a traitor to the Empire. Knowing that Vader would be the perfect foil to Cylo's subjects, the Emperor made sure the two men met. The day he informed Vader of his punishment for his failure at the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, he also summoned Cylo for a private meeting. When his apprentice asked who the scientist was, Sidious refused to answer him, leading Vader to conduct his own investigation into the Emperor's secrets.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 20\" /><ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" />\n\nAfter Vader's hired bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]] successfully apprehended Cylo in his fourth body, he revealed under torture the location of his [[Cylo's research base|secret research base]]. The Sith Lord made his way to the base where he began an [[Skirmish in Cylo's research base|assault]] to find his potential rivals and destroy them. However, Cylo-IV's death at the hands of Vader's torture droid [[0-0-0]] had not killed the scientist: having recreated himself as an immortal system, whenever one of Cylo's bodies died, another was activated on board his research base. Cylo-V had guessed that Vader had discovered the location of his base and that he would be coming when he was activated. As such, he contacted the Emperor so that he could give him a demonstration of his subjects. Sidious arrived as Vader was about to kill the scientist. Only his intervention saved Cylo-V from suffering his predecessor's fate. With all the elements for his plan to begin, the Emperor demanded Cylo start the presentation.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 4\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 4|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 4]]</ref><ref name=\"Darth Vader 5\" />\n\n[[File:Blasphemy_to_the_force_itself.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Darth Sidious turns to Cylo and his experiments in a bid to test his apprentice.]]\nAs they fought with Vader, Cylo presented to him the subjects that he had been working on over the past twenty years: [[Aiolin Astarte]] and [[Morit Astarte]], twins born to a family which had supported the Separatists during the Clone Wars, who had been upgraded genetically and cybernetically to possess abilities similar to the Jedi and Sith of old without having to use the Force; [[Tulon Voidgazer]], a genius scientist involved with high-level R&D development before she was upgraded with a cloud of drone-droids, connected directly to her brain, who allowed her to see and fight through them; Commander [[Karbin]], a Mon Calamari veteran of the Clone Wars who had spent eighteen years on life support after his ship crashed, and who had been upgraded into a model resembling the late General Grievous and trained in lightsaber combat. Finally, Cylo had created a system which could possess various hosts, tested on a [[Unidentified Trandoshan (Cylo-V's warrior)|Trandoshan]], and remove any traits the Emperor would not desire, such as pain and emotions. Sufficiently impressed, Sidious demanded a real demonstration of their abilities. Vader and the subjects began to fight to the death against one another, and the [[Trandoshan]] was killed by Morit before the Emperor called a stop to the fight. He announced that he would find a use for every one of them, but that only one would win a place as his enforcer. The sole rule he established was that they not kill each other; or make sure if they did that he not find out. As he made to leave, the Emperor called Vader to speak to him privately.<ref name=\"Vader 6\" />\n\n====A worthy apprentice====\n{{Quote|Do not underestimate how much you disappointed me on Mustafar.

He was also impressed with his apprentice's ability to act beyond his knowledge, and how he had been able to [[Secret mission to Geonosis|acquire]] a private army of [[BX-series droid commando|Separatist-era commando droids]] to use for his own ends. Vader was displeased with being forced to prove himself against Cylo's subjects, especially as he considered them blasphemous to the ways of the Force. Sidious chastised him for reprimanding him, reminding him that he was the teacher while Vader remained the apprentice: his task was to learn what Sidious knew, and Sidious's was to discover what there was to teach. The Emperor also revealed that he needed Vader to overcome the disappointment he had caused in him when he almost fell on Mustafar, and prove himself worthy of carrying the name Sidious had given him when he had pledged himself to the Sith. With his business concluded, the Emperor left Cylo's base and returned to Coruscant.<ref name=\"Vader 6\" />\n\nAt the Emperor's directive, Cylo's subjects were placed at Grand General Tagge's disposal, while the doctor acted as a consultant for the military. The rivalry between them and Vader eventually led to the [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|confrontation]] with the Rebel Alliance on [[Vrogas Vas]]. As a result of Karbin's manipulation, Vader crashed on Vrogas Vas when he confronted three Rebel squadrons. One pilot chose to crash his X-Wing into Vader's TIE fighter to bring him down. On the surface, Vader confronted a large force or Rebel soldiers assembled by Leia Organa to eliminate his threat. The confrontation culminated in a battle between the Sith Lord and Karbin, which resulted in the latter's death. The Rebellion suffered important losses on Vrogas Vas, and Karbin's disappearance led the Emperor to search for him. Vader eventually made his way to Coruscant where he presented his master with Karbin's corpse. Although Sidious was annoyed that his apprentice had violated his rule, he was impressed when Vader challenged him to provide him with another way to prove himself worthy of his trust. The Emperor gave his apprentice command of the military force he was sending to Shu-Torun to preserve Queen Trios's hold on the [[throne]]. However, he also sent Cylo and his remaining subjects, apparently on Grand General Tagge's request. Before Vader left the Imperial Palace, Sidious warned him not to disappoint him, as he relied on him more than he let on.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 16\" />\n\nVader's campaign on Shu-Torun was a success, and the rebellious Ore-dukes were brought down. In the middle of the battle, Cylo attempted to have his rival killed by forming an alliance with Baron [[Rubix]], the leader of the Shu-Torun rebels. Vader evaded the trap and, with the help of a dying Aiolin Astarte who had been betrayed by her brother, secured the proof needed to prove the doctor's treachery from her memory circuit. Once Vader's business was concluded on Shu-Torun, he informed the Emperor of Cylo's betrayal and told him that he had fled with his remaining subjects. Pleased that his plan had worked, Sidious summoned Vader to him on the shipyard where the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'' was being built.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 17\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 17|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 17]]</ref><ref name=\"Darth Vader 18\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 18|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 18]]</ref><ref name=\"Darth Vader 19\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 19|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 19]]</ref><ref name=\"Darth Vader 20\" />\n\n====End of Games====\n{{Quote|The fleet will be yours.

Vader recognized that, should one of his rivals had been the last one standing, the Emperor would be having the same conversation with them. However, he declared that he had succeeded and that he represented the strength of the dark side.

It was then that Sidious told Vader that Aphra had informed him of all of his secret endeavors, many of which had been technically treasonous. However, rather than chastise or punish Vader, the Emperor told his apprentice that he was impressed with his ambitions and that he was everything he could have hoped for. He then left Vader to deal with Aphra as he pleased. Due to Tagge's failure, the Emperor demoted him and transferred command of the ''Executor'' and its [[Death Squadron|fleet]] to Vader.

However, something bigger was growing. Sitting within his Imperial Office, Sidious sensed a great disturbance in the Force. It was not unlike that which he had sensed within the moments before the Death Star's destruction. Sidious sought to see within the disturbance, which brought him to a vision of a boy holding a crimson lightsaber, having seemingly decapitated the Emperor's Royal Guards within his very own Imperial Office. As he watched, the boy approached a seated Sidious within the vision, calling to the Force to choke Sidious' doppelganger. The doppelganger attempted to electrocute the boy with Force Lightning, but failed to stop him. The doppelganger attempted to call upon his lightsaber but instead the boy commanded it and turned the saber on midflight, eventually overpowering the doppelganger when the Sith Lord's own saber struck him down. A familiar voice then called to the boy, who proceeded to walk to the same spot the real Sidious now occupied. The boy knelt in front of the hidden figure as the voice noted that the boy had done well. Sidious then realized who the voice belonged to: That of Anakin Skywalker. Sidious concluded that this must be a dream of Anakin's.<ref name=\"Disturbance\" />\n\nProbing deeper within the vision, Sidious witnessed the scene of the unmasked and unburnt Anakin Skywalker walking beneath the sight of endless Star Destroyers, walking together with a figure that seemingly resembled him as well as the looming figure of the long deceased Senator Padme Amidala, now alive once more. The figure referred to Anakin as Father and to Padme as Mother. Anakin then motioned to the fleet, referring to the boy as Luke, stating that the fleet that flew above them was now the most powerful in the galaxy. Having witnessed this, Sidious was thrown out of the vision, but he had witnessed enough. From these pieces he deduced that Vader's prior actions made supposedly under the guise of destroying the Alliance leadership were actually motivated by a desire to find his son and shape him to his vision. Sidious then resolved to give Vader the resources to do just that while waiting for Vader to make a mistake. When he made that mistake, Sidious would be ready to take advantage of it for his own purposes and ensuring Vader's simultaneous downfall.<ref name=\"Disturbance\" /> With Darth Vader aboard his<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> command ship,<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]'',<ref name=\"Ozzel DB\">{{Databank|admiral-ozzel|Admiral Ozzel|archivedate=20170623041918}}</ref> the Emperor ultimately contacted the [[commanding officer]] of the vessel, [[Admiral]] Piett, telling him to have Lord Vader contact him immediately.

So how&hellip;''how'' can you ''claim'' it?|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|Darth Vader (2020) 11}}\nHowever, much to Sidious' dismay, Vader fought off his assassin and discovered a [[Sith wayfinder]] which led the way to the hidden Sith world of [[Exegol]] in the [[Unknown Regions]], where much of Sidious' spare power and resources were kept in reserve. Defeating an Imperial fleet and a [[Summa-verminoth]] guarding the planet, Vader reached Exegol with Ochi in tow. Stepping outside of his [[Sith Citadel]], the Emperor was met by Ochi, who warned him of Vader's arrival. Looking up at his apprentice as he rode on the back of the Summa-verminoth, Sidious asked Vader what this experience had taught him, to which Vader replied that he would teach his master what it was to fear. Vader then rode the Summa-verminoth into battle, to which Sidious sent out two crustaceous creatures to attack the monster. Though the creatures were defeated, Sidious then used the Force to crush the Summa-verminoth himself, forcing Vader to return to ground level as Sidious went back inside the Citadel. As Vader and Ochi followed him inside, Sidious taunted his apprentice through the Force, explaining to him the horrors that he would find.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 2020 11\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 11]]</ref>\n\nWithin the Citadel were large vats containing [[Strand-Cast|bioengineered organisms]] strong in the dark side of the Force, along with countless Sith statues, [[Exegol Sith guard|Sith guards]], [[Sith cultist|Sith cultists]] and a jar containing the severed hand of Vader's son. Though these creations were not Sith, Sidious claimed that any one of them could replace Vader if he were to fall. After fighting his way through his master's monsters, Vader was followed by Ochi to one of the Citadel's lower levels. There, they discovered an entire fleet of star destroyers, each armed with a [[Axial superlaser|planet-destroying cannon]]. Just beyond this fleet was a massive dome filled with red light and piercing screams. Despite Ochi's attempts to dissuade him, Vader entered the dome and came upon his master's greatest secret; a subterranean mountain of kyber crystal, bled red by the Sith cultists who kept it in constant pain. Sidious explained that he did this in order to power the cannons of his fleet. When the crystal was cut, it screamed in pain and sent out a wave of power, knocking off Ochi's helmet and burning his unprotected eyes. Vader suffered as well as Sidious mocked him for attempting to claim his power. Sidious then told his apprentice that if he continued to walk with him, he would never escape his pain. But only by walking with him would he be able to share his master's power. When Sidious asked his apprentice if he had chosen, Vader replied \"Yes, my master\" before departing from Exegol along with Sidious, Ochi, Amedda and Sly Moore.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 2020 11\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 11]]</ref>\n\n====War with Crimson Dawn====\n{{Quote|Crimson Dawn has barely shown its strength.

As Vader was repaired once again, Amedda warned Sidious of his intentions to kill him. Sidious replied that with Vader now knowing the limits of his role, he would find a more appropriate target for his hate, assuring both Amedda and Moore that he was beyond Vader's reach and they were beneath his notice. Once Vader was repaired, he asked Sidious his will, to which Sidious told him to decide that for himself. Vader then called over Ochi, who had just been given a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic visor]] so he could continue to see. After gaining the Emperor's approval, Ochi departed with Vader in a Lambda-class shuttle to begin their next assignment; killing Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 2020 12\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 12]]</ref>\n\nThis quest eventually led Vader to the [[Auction for Han Solo]] held by [[Lord|Lady]] [[Qi'ra]] of the newly reemerged crime syndicate [[Crimson Dawn]]. Vader retrieved the stolen smuggler from the auction on [[Jekara]] in order to lure Luke Skywalker to him. However, this move drew the ire of the [[Grand Hutt Council]], who attacked the ''Executor'' to reclaim Jabba's prize from the Empire. While Vader engaged his son in a dogfight over the planet, Admiral Piett called Vader for assistance against the Hutt attack, to which Vader replied that the attack was not his concern. In turn, Piett contacted the Emperor himself to appraise him of the situation. Sidious then told the Admiral to inform Vader that eliminating the Hutt Council was his new priority. Vader conceded and allowed his son to escape before slaughtering the Hutt Council, ending their attack while Boba Fett retrieved his bounty from the ''Executor'' and brought him to [[Jabba's Palace]] on Tatooine.<ref name=\"WOTBH 5\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 5|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 5]]</ref> As Vader choked Moore on the ''Executor'' for betraying him, he was contacted by Sidious, to which he released his grip on the Umbaran and knelt before the Emperor.

Vader, who had been told to dispatch the fleet to the moon and to remain on a command ship, sensed his son's arrival. Because of this, he journeyed to the Death Star, where he told the Emperor that he sensed Luke's arrival. Surprised that he himself was unable to sense it, the Emperor commanded Vader to go and wait for him, saying that he had foreseen Luke seeking Vader out and surrendering to him personally out of compassion for his father.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nShortly after Skywalker and the rebel strike team landed on Endor, the Emperor summoned his secret prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Admiral Gallius Rax, for a secret meeting aboard his [[Emperor's Throne Room|throne room]] on the second Death Star. Sensing a [[shatterpoint]] approaching, Darth Sidious warned Rax that it may soon be time to implement the Contingency. He then ordered Rax to take<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]]<ref name=\"The Rebel Files\" /> ''[[Ravager]]'' into the [[Vulpinus Nebula]] and hide until the events of this shatter point had resolved. He also told Rax that there would be others he had to call to his side.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nOnce Luke surrendered, Darth Vader brought his son to the space station and his master's throne room. The Emperor greeted Luke, dismissed the guardsmen and removed his chains. Luke was told that the Emperor planned to turn Luke to the dark side and that all that has happened on the Moon was all his plan. The Emperor also managed to explain that his father was irredeemable and could never be turned from the dark side. Sidious also had a surprise in store for the Rebels. When the Alliance Fleet arrived, the Death Star's superlaser was operational, contrary to what the Rebels had been led to believe. The Death Star was able to destroy several of the command ships, but the Rebels both on the surface and in space managed to press forward with their attack, as Lando was counting on Han to destroy the Shield Generator.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Palpatine_saber_clash.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious manipulated Skywalker into a battle with his father, seeking to replace Vader with a younger apprentice.]]\nLuke was then manipulated by the Emperor, who told him of his friends' impending doom and Luke was told that he would soon become his apprentice. Luke at first resisted, but as the Emperor continued to taunt him, Luke grew angrier and then grabbed his lightsaber to strike the old man down. Darth Vader intercepted Luke's strike and the two began to engage in a duel much to the Emperor's delight.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nLuke was first able to calm himself, refusing several times to continue fighting his father. Luke attempted to hide from Vader as their fight became more intense but Vader was able to sense his son's thoughts and learned that Luke had a sister. With this knowledge, Vader told Luke that if he did not turn to the dark side, perhaps Leia would. The threat of losing his sister enraged Luke and drove him to angrily attack Vader.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nAfter Luke cut off Vader's mechanical hand, Sidious betrayed Vader by instructing Luke to take Vader's place by his side. However, Luke began to see what had happened and that he was dangerously close to becoming like his father was now; a slave to the dark side of the Force. Luke threw away his lightsaber and turned to face the Emperor. He told the Emperor that he would never turn to the dark side and that he was a Jedi, like his father before him.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n====Demise====\n{{Quote|If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed!|Darth Sidious, to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n[[File:TorturePalpatine2321.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious punished the defiant Jedi while Vader could only watch as his son was slowly tortured to death.]]\nAngered by Skywalker's defiance, the Emperor unleashed a torrent of Force lightning upon him, forcing him onto the floor. The Emperor then proceeded to torment Luke, remarking that his rudimentary skills were no match for the power of the dark side. Meanwhile, Darth Vader watched his son struggle and plead for him to intervene, with Sidious threatening to kill the defenseless, young Skywalker; unbeknownst to Sidious, this was troubling Vader. Ultimately his concern and compassion for his son caused the former Anakin Skywalker to wake up and save Luke. The redeemed Anakin grabbed the Emperor, and threw him off a ledge down the Death Star's reactor shaft to his imminent death. Firing his lightning upward as he fell, the Emperor apparently could do nothing but scream as he went the long way down towards the second Death Star's reactor, causing a great explosion upon hitting it and releasing a light blue wind which encompassed the throne room before falling back down the shaft.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:First_Death_2.png|thumb|left|250px|Redeemed by his son's compassion, Vader sacrificed himself by destroying Darth Sidious, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.]]\nHaving killed Darth Sidious and been reborn as a Jedi Knight, Anakin Skywalker had brought the destruction of the Sith. With his armor badly damaged by the Emperor's lightning, Anakin's decision to save his son's life would cost him his own. Before passing away into the Force, a dying Anakin requested Luke to remove the helmet Sidious forced him to wear all those years so he could finally see his son's face with his own eyes. Luke tried to convince Anakin to let him be saved by him, but Anakin told Luke that he already did and that he was right about there still being good in him, despite all that he had done.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> With his death, Anakin had fulfilled the ancient prophecy as Qui-Gon Jinn had believed he would thirty-six years earlier.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> With this his nightmarish era of tyranny died with him.

Whether or not Sidious made any significant progress in obtaining this goal is not known however, as he would have needed Vader's assistance to perform the sorts of rituals he had in mind.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> During the Imperial Era, Darth Sidious sought to gain access to the World between Worlds in order to control time as well as the universe.<ref name=\"A World Between Worlds\" /> Following his first death, Sidious still sought ways to achieve immortality and the preservation of the Sith, as was seen by his attempt to perform a ritual on his granddaughter Rey in order to transfer his spirit into her body, which would allow Sidious to continue the Sith's legacy.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\nPalpatine even despised the [[aliens]], because most of the Sith leaders were [[humans]],{{Fact}} resulting in an Imperial policy on non-human species, with humans being the masters of the galaxy while the other species were enslaved by the Empire.<ref name=\"Rebels Visual Dictionary\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]''</ref> However, he had trust in some aliens, such as his master Darth Plagueis, his apprenticem Darth Maul, and his confidant Mas Amedda.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /><ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:SidiousSaber-ROTS.png|thumb|left|250px|As the Emperor, Sidious no longer needed to maintain two identities, and fully embraced his Sith persona in thought and action.]]\nTo those who had been at his nonexistent mercy, Sidious was known to be exceptionally sadistic, and he often took visible pleasure in torturing others.<ref name=\"The Lawless\" /> He was similarly quite bloodthirsty as well, and frequently reveled in combat to the point of laughing while he fought or killed.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /><ref name=\"The Lawless\" /><ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> He was also noted for his lack of forgiveness, as even Darth Vader, who was well known for summarily executing officers who failed him, considered Sidious to be even less clement than himself.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> According to [[Sosha Soruna]], the reason Sidious left his homeworld of Naboo relatively untouched during his reign was because he enjoyed tormenting the populace with the fact that he could destroy the serene beauty of the planet at anytime.<ref name=\"Shattered Empire 2\" /> In spite of his exceptional mastery of the dark arts, he was no less susceptible to fear, one of the primary emotions of the dark side, than any other Sith: after being attacked by a powerful [[Force push]] from Yoda, he displayed visible panic, attempted to flee rather than fight, and only confronted his opponent when he appeared to have no other choice.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Despite this, his passion to inflict pain on others and his hate were a priority to him over his own well-being: while he could have used his own powers to save himself from Darth Vader during the Battle of Endor, Sidious' hate was so strong that his only thought was to harm Vader as his apprentice carried him to his first death.<ref name=\"RotJ:BtPotDS!\">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref>\n\nUnlike Darth Vader, his more conservative apprentice, Sidious believed that progress was in no way contrary to the ways of the Sith. When Vader was presented to the cyborgs created by Doctor Cylo, he denounced them as abominations and heresy to the ways of the Force. However, Sidious claimed that he was merely an apprentice and was meant to learn what he knew and that Sidious was meant to discover what there was to teach. He also dismissed Vader's hatred of technological superiority by replying that everything was of the Force.<ref name=\"Vader 6\" />\n\n[[File:Sentinel_BFII.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious orchestrated the Galactic Empire's destruction, believing it needed to fall in order to rise as a true Sith Empire.]]\nSidious saw the fall of the Galactic Empire as a necessary consequence of his demise; he believed that the Empire had failed to protect its Emperor, despite the vast military at its disposal, and was therefore undeserving of a future without him. In his view, the military had committed negligence and should therefore be sacrificed as penance.<ref name=\"SotS\">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Sith]]''</ref> Using a game of Shah-tezh as an illustration, Sidious believed that the sole purpose for the Empire's existence was to protect his own life and well-being. He believed that the Empire was a failure if it failed to ensure the survival of its Emperor. Even before the formation of the Empire, Sidious had prepared for this fate by formulating a contingency plan. The Contingency involved luring the Empire to the barren Inner Rim planet Jakku and detonating the planet's core. The explosion would destroy both the planet and the orbiting Imperial and enemy fleets,<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> an outcome which Sidious regarded as retribution for the Empire's failures.<ref name=\"SotS\" /> The key to the Contingency was the Jakku Observatory, which concealed a borehole that penetrated the planet's core, and [[Counselor to the Empire]] Gallius Rax.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> Decades after his death, however, Supreme Leader Snoke discovered that the Contingency planned for the Empire's rebirth, secretly constructing shipyards and laboratories in the Unknown Regions in pursuit of this goal.<ref name=\"TLJ Expanded Edition\" />\n\nFollowing his demise on Endor and resurrection, in spite of his physical frailness, Sidious' mind was sharper than ever before.<ref name=\"Sidious' Body\" /> Upon realizing that the Jakku scavenger Rey was his granddaughter, Sidious manipulated Kylo Ren into bringing the young woman to him in order to steal her body as a new host. While he tried to sway Rey to his side by claiming that he cared for her, Rey saw through his ruse; by sensing his thoughts, she realized that his motives were fixated purely on his own preservation. When it became clear that Rey would not submit to his ritual, Sidious unleashed his fury, trying to kill both her and a redeemed Ben Solo. Even after experiencing death, Sidious's beliefs and way of being remained largely unchanged; his sole overriding ambitions were the attainment of unlimited power, a grand empire under his legacy, and the perpetuation of a Sith Order embodied through him. He would go to any lengths to realize these goals, including harm his own progeny.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n[[File:SidiousRevealsRey-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious went to great lengths to cheat death, a power he learned from the Sith Master he killed.]]\nSidious was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who stood at 1.73 to 1.78 [[meter]]s<ref name=\"DBPalpatine\" /> and weighed 75 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name=\"SWJB\" /> Before his disfigurement, he was a slim man sporting wavy hair, a prominent nose, blue eyes, and a narrow face. By the Invasion of Naboo, his red hair was graying,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> and it had turned entirely silver ten years later.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> As he became more embroiled in his plot to control the galaxy, the strain of leading a double life began to show in his face.<ref name=\"VE\">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref> After his duel with Windu, Sidious' visage was heavily disfigured and withered, with deathly pale, wrinkled skin, flesh sagging from his bulging forehead and around his piercing yellow eyes.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Serving as a reminder of his own weakness and mortality, the change further fueled his hatred of the Jedi.<ref name=\"VE\" /> His voice was altered to a degree as well, becoming deeper and taking on an edge that many found to be sinister. Tarkin, however, was of the opinion that Sidious's voice merely sounded strained when compared to that of his pre-war persona.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> For most of his reign, the Emperor remained away from public view and crafted holograms or idealized portraiture that depicted him in his prime, as he was in the last years of the Galactic Republic.<ref name=\"SWP\">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref> Even so, as the reign of the Empire solidified, the citizenry of the galaxy largely forgot the name of \"Palpatine,\" and the man was known simply as \"the Emperor.\"<ref name=\"longgame\">{{InsiderCite|188|The Long Game (Star Wars Insider)|The Long Game}}</ref> When he was discovered on Exegol, Sidious, inhabiting a clone body, appeared to be in a putrid and decaying state. His face appeared similar to what it was prior to his original body's disfigurement, but his skin was more pallid than it was before the transfer, his eyes were white, his lips were blackened, and his fingers had begun to rot away, exposing the bone underneath. Upon draining Rey and Ben Solo of their life energy to restore his own, his appearance more closely resembled what he looked like before his first death.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will.|Yoda, to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n===Force powers===\n{{Quote|Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.|Darth Sidious|audio=AsIHaveForeseen-ROTJ.ogg|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n[[File:DarthSidious-SWGoH.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious was a master practitioner of Force lightning, a dark side power used to torture, disfigure, and kill one's victims.]]\nAs the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith in his time,<ref name=\"SWEYoda\" /> Darth Sidious was amongst the most powerful Force-users in galactic history.<ref name=\"Lightsaber Collection\">''[[Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection]]''</ref> He used [[Force lightning]] both as a deadly attack<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> and as a means of [[torture]].<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> On several occasions on Ryloth, he utilized blasts of Force lightning powerful enough to not have only killed the lyleks on contact, but also badly charred and scorched their carapaces, which were tough enough to repel heavy blaster fire. On another occasion, he used the ability to damage a Twi'lek freighter's engines badly enough to pull it out of the sky with telekinesis.<ref name=\"LOTS\" /> Sidious could use Force lightning in a number of ways, including striking multiple enemies at once, with the bolts jumping from one victim to the other, like a chain and imbuing the ground around a victim's feet with energy, effectively electrocuting them. His Force lightning's raw power was demonstrated to be far greater than that of Dooku's; while Yoda was able to effortlessly absorb and deflect Dooku's lightning, he was only able to partially deflect Sidious's. Another more obscure ability that he possessed was the power to produce a [[Dark Aura|dark aura]], a miniature storm of malevolent Force energy that slowed the movement of and tortured all that it caught within its radius.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" /> The maximum potential of Sidious's Force lightning, however, was achieved before his final death on Exegol; when restored back to his former self, Sidious unleashed an immense wave of Force lightning towards the sky which rapidly expanded enough to disable all the ships of the Resistance.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n[[File:DunMoch.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious demonstrated his prowess at telekinesis during his battle with Yoda.]]\nHe was also highly skilled with telekinesis; during his duel with Yoda,<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> during which the two were equally matched,<ref name=\"CVD\" /> Sidious levitated several Senate pods simultaneously, including the one he was standing on, with great dexterity and accuracy.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Likewise, he was skilled enough with telekinesis that he was also able to remove Luke Skywalker's handcuffs while barely having to lift even a finger when they met face to face on the second Death Star.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Sidious was capable of unleashing a Force push strong enough to easily send Maul and Opress flying and he was able to keep them pinned with little effort. He later effortlessly slammed Maul into the ground and walls, badly wounding him. Sidious was also highly skilled with Force choke. When he arrived on Mandalore, he was effortlessly able to telekinetically throttle two Mandalorians to death at once and used this power on two others while standing on the other side of the room that they were in.<ref name=\"The Lawless\" /> He was even able to use his abilities on a target from hundreds of light years away, using only a holo-transmission to show him his target, allowing him to telekinetically choke and pick up Count Dooku and open the handcuffs of Bridger while projecting himself to their respective locations through the use of a hologram.<ref name=\"TLO\" /><ref name=\"FRAF\" />\n\nDarth Sidious was exceptionally adept at foreseeing the future, an ability which allowed him to plan for nearly any contingency.<ref name=\"LOTS\" /> He believed that, with enough time and practice, he would eventually have been able to use the dark side to view the future with infallible accuracy.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> The Dark Lord also was proficient in Sith magic, as he was able to cast a Dark illusion on Yoda using a ritual that applied Balc speech incantations and managed to access the World between Worlds using an unknown ritual. He was also capable of using Sith magic to generate a blue fiery energy, which he used to attack Ezra and Ahsoka, that he can use both as a weapon and a tool in order to bind and draw someone closer, as it did with Ezra; the energy wrapping around his leg and becoming akin to a tangible rope as well as knowledge of the ancient Sith tongue, [[ur-Kitt\u00e2t]].<ref name=\"A World Between Worlds\" /><ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> The Dark Lord was also adept in the use of [[Mind trick|Force Persuade]] to such an extent that he was able to take complete control of a subject's mind and force them to obey his commands.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n[[File:Force_drained_by_Sidious.png|thumb|right|250px|Through the dark side, Sidious was able to drain power from the dyad of Ben Solo and Rey, restoring his clone vessel to full strength.]]\nLikewise, Sidious was also capable of using [[Dark Absorption]].<ref name=\"SW:FC\">''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]''</ref> He was also capable of telepathically communicating with Darth Vader over a distance of hundreds of light-years. It appeared, however, as though this ability may have been limited to sending and receiving relatively simple messages such as Vader requesting that a starfighter be shipped to him, as the two Sith Lords communicated through holoprojections while discussing more complex matters.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> Sidious also had a remarkably keen ability to sense the thoughts and feelings of others, including those of incredibly powerful Force adepts such as Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"LOTS\" /><ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> On a related note, he was also capable of hiding his own thoughts and feelings from even such individuals as Yoda, and managed to conceal his true dark nature from the entire Jedi Council for decades before deliberately revealing himself.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Sidious also used [[Force Dash]] and could move as fast as a \"lightning strike\".<ref name=\"LOTS\" /> He even created the extremely powerful Force-wielder Snoke, who far surpassed Kylo Ren and Rey. He was able to easily overpower both Ben Solo and Rey, as shown by how he deactivated their lightsabers and disarmed them using the Force, then later easily telekinetically picked up the former and threw him into the pit behind him. Sidious also demonstrated the ability to [[Force drain|drain]] life essence or the Force from his victims as he did with Rey and Ben Solo in their confrontation on Exegol.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n===Lightsaber skills===\n[[File:MeesaGonnaKillYousa-TL.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious possessed considerable skill in the art of lightsaber combat.]]\nDespite his frail appearance, Darth Sidious was immensely skilled in [[lightsaber combat]],<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> to the point of being one of the greatest duelists of all time.{{Fact}} Having fully mastered all seven forms of lightsaber combat,{{Fact}} Sidious was one of the very few who could go head to head with both Yoda and Mace Windu. As a result of his tremendous skill, he effortlessly killed Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin&mdash;who were considered to be two of the finest lightsaber duelists of their time&mdash;{{Fact}}each with a single blow, and while also engaged with Mace Windu, he slew the formidable [[Nautolan]] Kit Fisto only moments later. He then fought Windu on equal grounds for an extended period of time and even briefly had the upper hand, although he was ultimately disarmed by a kick to the face which caused him to drop his lightsaber. Later on, Sidious was able to duel almost evenly against Yoda in a lightsaber duel, but in the end, he had to use his Force powers to force Yoda to retreat. Sidious had an extremely aggressive, rage-fueled dueling style and augmented his swordplay by using Force-enhanced speed, which allowed him to kill three experienced Jedi Masters at once within seconds. When fighting at his full power, the Sith Lord was an utterly terrifying opponent, able to overwhelm even the most experienced and skilled duellists. His style was a combination of brutal aggression, extreme speed, and lethal precision making him an almost unstoppable opponent. In fact, the only person known to have defeated him in a duel was Mace Windu.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:PalpatinesLightsaber-Convergence.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious was as deadly with a single lightsaber as he was with dual sabers.]]\nAlthough Sidious usually used only one lightsaber, he was also exceptionally skillful in [[Jar'Kai]], wielding both of his lightsabers against Darth Maul and Savage Opress. Utilizing a violently ferocious yet extremely fluid fighting style, Sidious easily held off the two brothers on equal grounds and ultimately separated them, stunning Maul for a brief time with the Force before swiftly toying with and killing Opress. While Sidious showed some difficulty against his former apprentice, who put up a far more ferocious fight than Opress (due to the latter's death and Sidious's subsequent taunts against him about him being replaced by Darth Tyranus) and appeared to match him with every blow, parry, and kick, the Dark Lord eventually used his superior strength in the Force to disarm and bring Maul to his knees in roughly only a minute. He was also skilled in blaster deflection, able to easily deflect every single blaster shot aimed at him when he fought on Ryloth.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nDuring the Naboo Crisis, Sidious wore an elaborate blue [[cloak]]. As Supreme Chancellor, he wore golden [[Clothing|robes]] with a [[velvet]] overcloak in the days surronding the Battle of Geonosis and a dark crimson [[Clothing|gigot-sleaved robe]] in the final days of the Clone Wars. As he rose to power he wore cloaks more infitting with Sith traditions, although without lessening his taste in lavish and comfortable fabrics. When declaring himself Emperor, Sidious wore a red robe patterned with emblems reminiscent of the [[serpent]]s of the planet Moraband. As Galactic Emperor, he later wore a black [[zeyd cloth]] robe with a hood to hide his disfigured face. He used two identical lightsabers.<ref name=\"VE\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n===Conception===\n[[File:MCQ-emperor.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Concept art of Darth Sidious by [[Ralph McQuarrie]]]]\nFrom the very beginning of the writing process on the [[1977]] original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], director [[George Lucas]] had in mind the character that would eventually develop into the currently known Emperor. One of the earliest documents regarding the project is a paper dating to early [[1973]], which compiled a list of names to potentially use in the story. At the very top of this list appeared the name \"Emperor Ford Xerxes XII,\" as Xerxes was a historical Persian king who was assassinated by his own son, and would be then changed to \"Alexander Xerxes XII,\" then \"Emperor of Decarte.\" None of these mentioned names would be used ultimately.\n\nIn [[1983]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI - ''Return of the Jedi'']], Darth Sidious was never identified neither by his real name or his Sith alter ego on-screen, as he was referred just as \"The Emperor\" by most characters or \"Master\" by Darth Vader.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> The Emperor's name was supplied in supplementary materials, including the script for Episode VI.

He became at first surprised that Lucas asked him to reprise the role, as he supposed that Darth Sidious would be played by a young actor, but he accepted the offer and returned for the role once more.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /><ref name=\"Episode II\" /><ref name=\"Episode III\" /> One of the things that George told McDiarmid about playing the young Palpatine was to imagine that his face was a mask that was hiding the monster's face, which made him portray him a seemingly friendly man who was always nice to people. <ref>{{Youtube|58xjtNARA4E|Ian McDiarmid Interview - Star Wars Celebration 2017 Orlando|channel/UCYtStMnqPtT86BWQA11ywKA|Disneyland Experience|archivedate=20200229181107}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Celebration Chicago]] [[2019]], it was officially confirmed that McDiarmid would be reprising his role as Darth Sidious in [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']], the final installment of the [[sequel trilogy]] and the [[Star Wars saga|''Star Wars'' saga]] overall, scheduled to be released on [[December 20]], 2019.

Not how they're taken over where there's a coup or anything like that, but how the democracy turns itself over to a tyrant.\"</ref> Lucas, in fact, created the first ''Star Wars'' film as an anti-[[Wikipedia:Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] message, implying that the Empire was what America could have been, had it won the war ten years before [[1973]].<ref name=\"Nixonian gangsters\">''The Making of Star Wars'', page 17<br />\"The empire is like America ten years from now, after Nixonian gangsters assassinated the Emperor and were elevated to power in a rigged election; created civil disorder by instigating race riots aiding rebel groups and allowing the crime rate to rise to the point where a 'total control' police state was welcomed by the people. Then the people were exploited with high taxes, utility and transport costs. Gangsters, a cartel made up of power companies, transport companies & crime organizations. Other companies had to pay bribes to stay in business\" The Making of Star Wars: 7-8,17.</ref> Lucas opined, however, that Vice President [[Wikipedia:Dick Cheney|Dick Cheney]] was actually closer to Darth Sidious.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/opinion/19dowd.html?ref=opinion|title=The Aura of Arugulance|author=Dowd, Maureen|date=2009-04-19|work=The New York Times|archivedate=20180811172259}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Death.png|thumb|left|160px|Death, from ''The Seventh Seal'']]\nIn addition, film critic [[Wikipedia:Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert]] and film historian [[Wikipedia:Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] noted that Darth Sidious' appearance resembled Death from the [[1950s#1957|1957]] epic historical film, [[Wikipedia:The Seventh Seal|''The Seventh Seal'']]<ref name=\"Ebert\">Roger Ebert, review of ''Return of the Jedi'', Special Edition, in Chicago ''Sun-Times'', March 14, 1997, available [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970314/REVIEWS/703140303/1023 here]; last accessed August 17, 2006.</ref> and [[W:c:disney:The Evil Queen|Queen Grimhilde's]] witch form in the Disney's [[1930s#1937|1937]] animated film, [[W:c:disney:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'']].<ref>Robin Wood, ''Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan...and Beyond: A Revised and Expanded Edition of the Classic Text'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2003), p. 154, {{ISBN|0-231-12966-1}}.</ref> George Lucas himself said that where realistically, and originally, Darth Sidious appeared in a dark color, the Dark Lord of the Sith was brightened-up in post-production to the extent where he became a white-faced figure that resembles Death, a fittingly spooky look desired by Lucas himself.<ref name=\"HTW-SW\">{{Youtube|video=vqnjzVX8EKA|text=How to Watch Star Wars, Part One: The Prequels Are Better Movies Than You Deserve|channel=channel/UCgpmjsoKH3eEKz8z45gTbxQ|channelname=Rick Worley|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107035708/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqnjzVX8EKA}}</ref>\n\n===Original version===\nDarth Sidious was originally conceived as a weak-willed dullard named [[Cos Dashit]] with delusions of grandeur who was elevated first to President of the Republic and then Emperor, controlled by the Imperial bureaucracy, conformed by ministers like Wilhuff Tarkin. However, he was neither a Force user nor a great political strategist. Although this version of Sidious appeared in the original film's [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|novelization]], it was superseded by every other appearance since which revealed Darth Sidious as the mastermind of the events of the ''Star Wars'' saga. Although ''The Empire Strikes Back'' made clear his Force connection,<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> his Sith affiliation was first revealed in ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nIn the original story treatment for ''Revenge of the Sith'', Darth Sidious was intended to reveal that he created Anakin Skywalker through the midi-chlorians, thus making him, in some way, Anakin's father,<ref name=\"I'm Your Father\">''[[The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith]]'', page 42<br />\"On Coruscant, PALPATINE completes his seduction of ANAKIN, who at first refuses to go over to the dark side-- until the Chancellor makes a startling confession:\"<br />\n<br />\n DARTH SIDIOUS-- \"I have waited all these years for you to fulfill your destiny...

I used the power of the Force to will the midichlorians to start the cell divisions that created you.\"<br />\n<br />\n ANAKIN-- \"I don't believe you.\"<br />\n<br />\n DARTH SIDIOUS-- \"Ahhh, but you know it's true. When you clear your mind, you will sense the truth. you could almost think of me as your father.\"<br />\n<br />\n ANAKIN-- \"That's impossible!\"<br />\n<br />\n DARTH SIDIOUS-- \"Nevertheless, you must decide.\"</ref> although George Lucas ultimately cut this out of the film.<ref name=\"Palpatine fatherhood cut\">''The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith'', page 60</ref> Though this was dropped from the final cut, some hints that Darth Sidious and/or Darth Plagueis were responsible for Anakin's creation were included in the film.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n===Debates and discrepancies===\n====Visual appearances====\nOne known debate about Darth Sidious is his real appearance. In ''Revenge of the Sith'', during his duel against Mace Windu, upon being disarmed, Sidious uses Force lightning against the Jedi Master, but he deflects it back to him, causing his face to be disfigured and scarred in the process. Later on, when Anakin cuts Windu's hand to succor Sidious, he electrocuted Windu, knocking him off the window to his death, although the Force lightning doesn't disfigure Windu for the short period of time it is used.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nHowever, previous to the Force lightning's appearance in ''Revenge of the Sith'', when it first appeared in ''Return of the Jedi'', Sidious used it against Luke Skywalker, and it didn't disfigure or scar Skywalker.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n====Name====\nDarth Sidious' real name, Sheev Palpatine, was not given a first name in any canonical or [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] source until [[2014]], when the character's first name&mdash;Sheev&mdash;was revealed in the canon novel [[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] by author [[James Luceno]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> However, according to Luceno in an interview with [[StarWars.com]], the name was reportedly created by George Lucas for the ''[[Star Wars: Underworld]]'' TV show that he planned to make before budget constraints, his semi-retirement and [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]]'s buyout by The Walt Disney Company prevented him to do so.<ref name=\"Full of Sith Luceno interview\">50 min - 52 min mark: {{Cite_web|url=http://fullofsith.com/archives/1214|title=Full of Sith|author=Tha Mike|date=2014-11-02|archivedate=20160506161120}}</ref>\n\n====Other discrepancies====\nSidious' height has been stated to either be 1.73 meters,<ref name=\"DBPalpatine\" /><ref name=\"SWEPalpatine\" /> or 1.78 meters.<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref><ref name=\"SWESidious\" /> This article assumes the newer databank entry height on StarWars.com to be the correct height.<ref name=\"DBPalpatine\" />\n\nIn a question and answer session for [[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions|''The Clone Wars'': The Lost Missions]], [[Dave Filoni]] stated that Sidious had Darth Maul and Darth Tyranus as apprentices at the same time.<ref name=\"TCW Lost Missions Q&A\">{{SWYoutube|KGBdRW7jjUk|Sifo-Dyas and the Sith - The Lost Missions Q&A &#124; Star Wars: The Clone Wars|archivedate=20200125113106}}</ref> However, Sidious's biography gallery in the [[Databank (website)|Databank]] establishes that he recruited Dooku into the Sith during his time as Supreme Chancellor.

This article assumes this version of the timeline is correct.\n\n===Non-canon appearances===\n[[File:Public_enemies.png|thumb|right|240px|Darth Sidious, in [[LEGO]] form]]\nIn the non-canon ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures]]'', Darth Sidious was voiced by [[Trevor Devall]]. In the [[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season One|first season]], Sidious and Darth Vader learned about the history of a powerful lightsaber called the [[Kyber Saber]], which was made out of several kyber crystals. However, the Jedi Master who crafted the sword had deemed it too dangerous and destroyed the lightsaber before scattering all of the crystals throughout the galaxy. Seeking to destroy the galaxy in one blast, Darth Sidious attempted to collect all of the crystals. He and Vader dispatched the Sith agent [[Naare]] to recover the Kyber Saber crystals. However, Naare's mission was complicated by her encounter with the Force-sensitive [[Rowan Freemaker/LEGO|Rowan Freemaker]] and [[Freemakers/LEGO|his family]]. In an attempt to gain the crystals, Naare pretended to be a Jedi and offered to train him in the ways of the Force.<ref name=\"A Hero Discovered\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|A Hero Discovered}}</ref> Despite Sidious' efforts, the Sith Lord failed to take the Kyber Saber from Rowan, who managed to destroy the weapon.<ref name=\"Return of the Kyber Saber\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|Return of the Kyber Saber}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two|second season]], Darth Sidious creates an Imperial [[Hunter droid/LEGO|hunter droid]] called [[M-OC/LEGO|M-OC]], whom he tasks with hunting down Rowan.<ref name=\"Trouble on Tibalt\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|Trouble on Tibalt}}</ref> This arouses the jealousy of Darth Vader, who undermines M-OC's efforts on several occasions. Despite failing to capture the Freemakers on several occasions, M-OC manages to deflect blame by pointing out that Lord Vader obstructed his efforts to obtain an [[XX-23 S-thread tracker]].<ref name=\"TPATP\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|The Pit and the Pinnacle}}</ref> After Rowan builds a powerful starship called the [[Arrowhead (Freemakers)|''Arrowhead'']], Sidious forces Vader and M-OC to work together. M-OC lures Rowan into a [[Capture of Rowan Freemaker|trap]] on [[Qalydon]] but Vader outsmarts the droid and brings him to the Emperor.<ref name=\"A Perilous Rescue\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|A Perilous Rescue}}</ref>\n\nIn Imperial captivity, Rowan reveals that he destroyed the [[Kyber Saber]]. Though the Emperor wants to kill Rowan, Vader convinces the Emperor that Rowan can help them find more kyber crystals to power up the second Death Star. After Vader forces Rowan to reveal the location through a mind probe, the Emperor deems that Rowan has outlived his usefulness and orders his execution. However, Rowan is [[Rescue of Rowan Freemaker|rescued]] by his siblings. Meanwhile, M-OC rebuilds himself and steals the ''Arrowhead'' from the Freemakers, currying the Emperor's favor. The Emperor orders M-OC to hunt down the Freemakers.<ref name=\"Escape from Coruscant\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|Escape from Coruscant}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[Skirmish on Shantipole|skirmish]] on Shantipole, Rowan convinces M-OC that his programming is flawed.<ref name=\"Free Fall\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|Free Fall}}</ref> M-OC instead deduces there is a flaw in the second Death Star and rushes to the [[Endor system]]. However, M-OC's warnings fall on deaf ears since the Emperor is preoccupied with Luke Skywalker. Later, M-OC is distracted when he watched the Emperor falling to his death, allowing Rowan to defeat him once and for all.<ref name=\"ROTROTJ\">{{The Freemaker Adventures|Return of the Return of the Jedi}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Palpatine|imagecat=Images of Palpatine}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''\n*''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]'' {{Flash}}\n*[[Dooku: Jedi Lost (script)|''Dooku: Jedi Lost'' script]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2017) 1|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 1]]\n*[[Darth Maul (2017) 2|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 2]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2017) 3|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 3]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2017) 4|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 4]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2017) 5|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 5]]\n*[[Age of Republic -
