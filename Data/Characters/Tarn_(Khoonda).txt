He, like most on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] at the time disliked the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] though [[3956 BBY|five years earlier]] he had been the assistant of [[Dergar Chester]], the head technician for the [[Jedi Enclave]] at the time of [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|attack]].\n\nHe was supposed to free the tech chief when a door to a storage room in the Enclave got stuck while he attempted to fix it from the inside, but for unknown reasons Tarn was unsuccessful and at some point left the Enclave. As a result, Chester starved to [[Death/Legends|death]] in the wake of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombardment]]. Many others in Khoonda considered him to be something of an idiot, and not that great a mechanic. He attempted to repair an old [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] salvaged from the Enclave for use as a greeter, however he did a poor job of it and it took Surik's own skill at repair to get it working properly again.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhen the Exile fixes the protocol droid and has it play a recording having to do with her, Tarn hears it and asks the Exile if he/she is a Jedi. The player can [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] Tarn into thinking he had misheard the droid, but if the attempt is unsuccessful, Tarn will run off to tell everyone of the Exile's true nature. He never appears in the game again if this happens.\n\nThe Exile also has the opportunity to kill Tarn; however, this is not considered [[canon]]ical, as the Exile was canonically [[Light side of the Force/Legends|Light sided]].\n\nIt has been discovered that a glitch could give the player infinite Light side and [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark side]] points if the player follows the appropriate pattern correctly.<ref>[http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=qiP5qJ0ZdSI \"infinite light or dark side point KOTOR II 2 Sith Lords XBOX\" at YouTube]</ref>\n\nThe player can offer Tarn a chance to join the [[Khoonda Militia]] but he declines if asked, stating that he is \"way too busy to die.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tarn\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]"}}}]}}}}
