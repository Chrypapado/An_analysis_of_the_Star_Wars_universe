He invested all his small finances into a small sector of [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], from which he planned to grow into a larger criminal organization. He mostly dealt with information and setting up meetings for others. He also had rented out apartments to up-and-coming smugglers in hopes he could come across some information he could use against them.\n\nMany of his schemes involved setting old rivals against each other for his profit. However, instead of reinvesting his money wisely, he spent it on pleasure chambers, insidious death traps and security systems rather than [[Starship/Legends|ships]], spies and enforcers. He was most proud of the [[Falleen Lady]], a [[Casino/Legends|casino]] and pleasure house with pheromone-enhanced hostesses.\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Scum and Villainy (sourcebook)|''Scum and Villainy'']]\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Hutts of the Desilijic clan]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
