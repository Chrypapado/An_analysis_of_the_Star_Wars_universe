You start asking questions about Jedi&hellip; He's thinking that you might be bounty hunters.|Cudgel, to Olee Starstone|Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader}}\n'''Guania''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] at the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]. In that [[Standard year/Legends|year]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] and [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] came to the Wookiee world and helped its inhabitants [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|resist]] an assault by the [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|Separatist Droid Army]] in one of the final battles of the war. After the [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] surrendered, however, all [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] were [[Order 66/Legends|declared]] enemies of the Republic and were targeted for [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|execution]]. The war promptly [[Mission to Mustafar/Legends|ended]], and Guania and many other Wookiees began to clean up the battleground on Kashyyyk and salvage leftover machinery. Days after the fighting, the [[Human/Legends|Human]] liaison [[Cudgel (Human)|Cudgel]] informed Guania, the [[Hunting/Legends|hunter]] [[Lachichuk/Legends|Lachichuk]], and two other Wookiees that a group of [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] had arrived on Kashyyyk and were asking questions about Jedi. The Wookiees confronted them with [[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcasters]] drawn until they learned that the traders were actually Jedi on the run, at which point they brought the fugitives to see the Wookiee [[General/Legends|General]] [[Tarfful/Legends|Tarfful]] and his friend [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|They're interested in knowing why you're so interested in knowing whether any Jedi were here during the battle.|Cudgel, to Olee Starstone, speaking of Guania and three other Wookiees|Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader}}\nThe [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Guania lived on his [[Species/Legends|species]]' [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], the final [[Standard year/Legends|year]] of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]&ndash;spanning [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. In that year, a large [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|battle]] was fought on Kashyyyk in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Kachirho/Legends|Kachirho]]. Aided by several [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] and [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]], Wookiee warriors resisted a [[Ground warfare|ground assault]] by the [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|droid army]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name=\"Dark Lord\" /> Although the [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] surrendered,<ref name=\"Republic 82\">[[Republic 82|''Republic'' 82]]</ref> [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] across the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] suddenly [[Order 66/Legends|attacked]] their [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi Generals]] after the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic's]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] declared all [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] to be enemies of the government. The [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Chancellor]] then brought the war to an [[Mission to Mustafar/Legends|end]] and had all Confederate battle [[Droid/Legends|droids]] shut down,<ref name=\"Revenge of the Sith\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> which prompted the Republic forces to depart Kashyyyk. Guania joined in a large Wookiee effort to clean up the site of the battle and salvage the machinery that was left over.<ref name=\"Dark Lord\" />\n\n[[File:BattleofKashyyyk-ImperialEra.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Kashyyyk is invaded by the Galactic Empire.]]\nDays later, Guania was outside of Kachirho at a busy landing platform that saw [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] frequently make [[Planet/Legends|planetfall]]. He was with the<ref name=\"Dark Lord\" /> famed [[Hunting/Legends|hunter]]<ref name=\"Chronicles\">''[[Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels]]''</ref> [[Lachichuk/Legends|Lachichuk]] and two other Wookiees when the group was approached by [[Cudgel (Human)|Cudgel]], a [[Human/Legends|Human]] liaison who understood the Wookiees' [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]] [[Language/Legends|language]]. Cudgel informed them that a group of traders had just arrived and were asking questions about Jedi, and Guania and his companions followed the Human to the traders' [[Drunk Dancer|ship]]. They brandished their [[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcasters]] and demanded to know what the newcomers' interest in Jedi was, and the trader [[Olee Starstone]] stated that they were Jedi on the run who were looking for other survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]]. Her defiant comrade [[Siadem Forte]] contradicted her in an effort to protect their identities, and Guania began to suspect that they were [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] who were seeking Jedi [[Bounty/Legends|contracts]]. However, when Starstone named the Jedi [[General/Legends|Generals]] who had fought on Kashyyyk and pleaded for the group's help, the sympathetic Wookiees disabled their weapons, and Lachichuk suggested that they move to a private location in Kachirho.<ref name=\"Dark Lord\" />\n\nAlong with Cudgel, the Wookiees led the Jedi to a [[Wroshyr tree/Legends|Wroshyr tree]] that stood in the middle of the city and ascended it in a [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]] until they reached a central control room. Inside were the Wookiees [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and General [[Tarfful/Legends|Tarfful]], friends of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] who had helped the Jedi Master [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] flee the planet from clone [[Troop/Legends|troopers]], and Lachichuk briefed them on the situation. They informed Starstone that there were no surviving Jedi left on the planet and offered her and her companions safe haven, but a chime from one of the room's consoles at that moment told everyone present that forces of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]&mdash;the government that had succeeded the Republic after the war&mdash;were landing on Kashyyyk in search of renegade Jedi. A brawl between Wookiees and Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] back at the landing platform escalated into a large [[Battle of Kashyyyk (19 BBY)|battle]] that the Empire decisively won, and thousands of Wookiees were rounded up as Imperial [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]].<ref name=\"Dark Lord\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Lying? See, now you have everyone really confused, 'cause we always thought of the Jedi as truth tellers.|Cudgel, speaking to Olee Starstone about Guania and his companions|Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader}}\nLike other Wookiees who were present in and around Kachirho following the end of the Clone Wars, Guania was sympathetic to members of the Jedi Order who were in hiding during the Great Jedi Purge. He was suspicious of Olee Starstone and her companions when they came to Kashyyyk and began to make inquiries about Jedi, and he was wary of the possibility that they were bounty hunters working against the Jedi. Guania was observant of the fact that they had arrived in a military [[Transport/Legends|transport]] and that they looked as though they could account for themselves in a fight. When Starstone confirmed beyond doubt that she and her comrades were Jedi, Guania relaxed his guard.<ref name=\"Dark Lord\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Guanta-ROTS.png|thumb|right|125px|Guanta: A case of mistaken identity?]]\n{{Quote|Could this be typo, and really represent the Wookiee Guanta?|Bob Vitas|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204203023/http://cuswe.org/entryclass.asp?page=16&search=G}}\nGuania was created by author [[James Luceno]] for his [[2005]] novel ''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]''.
