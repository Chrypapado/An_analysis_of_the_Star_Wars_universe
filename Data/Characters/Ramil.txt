At one point, Ramil was grievously injured during racing competition he participated in, only saved by timely intervention of his brother, the [[Jedi Master]] Dooku, but was forced to wear a life-preserving suit of armor as a result of the incident. Eventually, Ramil became the [[Count of Serenno]], succeeding his father Gora, hoping he could turn the people against the [[Galactic Republic]] through manipulation with the help of a group of [[Abyssin]] [[pirate]]s that he hired. However, his [[Invasion of Serenno|efforts]] to do so failed when he battled against his brother, and Ramil was defeated and killed aboard his ship by Dooku. Dooku would then replace him as the Count of Serenno and as the head of its ruling house, House Serenno.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRamil first appeared in the audiobook ''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]'', written by [[Cavan Scott]].<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]'' {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*[[Dooku: Jedi Lost (script)|''Dooku: Jedi Lost'' script]] {{Flash}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Ramil\n|ru=\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u044c\n}}\n\n[[Category:Counts of Serenno]]\n[[Category:House of Dooku]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Serennian]]"}}}]}}}}
