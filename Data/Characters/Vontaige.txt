In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], faced by a surprise invasion of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] by [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow's]] [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], Vontaige attended a meeting with Teta and several others regarding the conflict which would come to be known as the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]]. After this meeting, Vontaige commanded the Koros [[Army/Legends|army]] against the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] in a [[Battle of Koros Major (Great Hyperspace War)|battle]] at Koros Major and helped lead Koros to victory.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Empress, given the size of that fleet, we may not be able to defend our ''own'' worlds!|Vontaige|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3}}\nVontaige was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] native to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros Major]] in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]]. He served as one of the top [[Advisor/Legends|advisors]] to [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta]], the ruler of the seven unified worlds of the Koros [[Star system/Legends|system]], and was an important [[General/Legends|general]] in Teta's military. Vontaige served under Teta in the [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|Unification Wars]] of the Koros system, [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|fighting]] against rebels on the world of [[Kirrek]]. Teta was victorious in the Unification Wars, and Vontaige returned to his place at her side as one of her top advisors. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], led by [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]], launched the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]], a surprise invasion of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Although Empress Teta had already been forewarned, the size of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] invasion force seemed to be overwhelming.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\nAfter the Great Hyperspace War's first [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Hyperspace War)|outbreak]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Vontaige attended a meeting with Teta; [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]]; [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] explorer [[Jori Daragon]], who first warned of the Sith threat; [[Llaban]], former leader of the Kirrek rebel forces; and several other advisors. During the meeting, Vontaige expressed concern that the Koros military didn't have enough firepower to defend their worlds. He also admonished Llaban, telling him that he and his rebels had dealt enough damage. However, Teta forced Vontaige to allow Llaban to speak, and Llaban offered to bolster Teta's military with the addition of his rebel [[Army/Legends|army]] from Kirrek. Teta accepted and dispatched Llaban to command his forces on Kirrek, while Vontaige stayed back on Koros Major to defend the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]].<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\nVontaige commanded the Koros forces in the [[Battle of Koros Major (Great Hyperspace War)|resultant battle]] from atop the [[City/Legends|city]] walls of Cinnagar and found himself in a tough situation. He was facing a numerically-superior Sith force, and many of the Tetan [[Warship/Legends|warships]] were damaged or destroyed in the Unification Wars. Still, Vontaige told his soldiers to stay vigilant, while observing the Sith approach with [[Macrobinoculars/Legends|binoculars]].<ref name=\"encounter\" /> In the end, however, Vontaige and the Koros forces prevailed at Koros Major, and the Republic eventually won the Great Hyperspace War.<ref name=\"dogs\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire 4|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 4]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Llaban, you and your rebels have caused enough damage!|Vontaige|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Fall of the Sith Empire 3}}\nAs one of Teta's top advisors and a respected general in Teta's military, Vontaige was fiercely loyal to the Empress. Due to the Unification Wars, Vontaige held great disdain for Llaban, who led the resistance to Teta's rule on Kirrek, and believed that he should not be allowed to participate in the war with the Sith. Although Vontaige was worried about the size of the Sith [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] compared to the reduced strength of Koros' [[Navy/Legends|navy]], Vontaige still led the Koros army against the Sith on Koros Major without reservation.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVontaige made his first&mdash;and so far only&mdash;appearance in the third issue of [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire|''Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire'']], a story arc of the ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Kevin J.
