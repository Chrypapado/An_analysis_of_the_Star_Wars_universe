In the [[Standard year|year]] [[5 ABY]], she was part of a meeting on board the flotilla [[Alderaanian escort frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' to discuss the future of the flotilla and witnessed the delivery of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]'s remains by the [[New Republic]] to the Alderaanians.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|We can try this.

She attended a meeting with the [[Regent Administrator]] [[Eglyn Valmor]] on board the Alderaanian [[frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' where they and several other leading members of the flotilla discussed their people's future. Valmor wished to remain in the Alderaan [[Star system|system]], but Pol and others like the former [[teacher]] [[Icar Orliss]] wished for the surviving Alderaanians to re-settle a new world. When Orliss produced a list of suitable planets they might choose from, [[Argus Tanzer]] interjected, arguing that re-settling a new world was not as simple as picking from a list, since they would need to follow the process put in place by the [[New Republic]]. Orliss and Pol both then argued that they were not part of the Republic and so need not follow the government's rules.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nThe arguing within the meeting continued until it was interrupted by reports of several large vessels approaching the flotilla. Pol and the others were then shocked to see a number of New Republic vessels hauling the remains of the Death Star toward the flotilla, which fellow flotilla member [[Teven Gale]] then revealed he had worked with Organa and Verlaine to acquire for the flotilla as a resource. Valmor and Gale then suggested building a new [[space station]] from the superweapon's remains, and Pol accepted the idea but stated that they still needed representation in the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]] and that resettlement was still on the table for discussion.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJanis Pol was a small, elderly woman by 5 [[Galactic standard calendar|ABY]], and was as sharp and pale as a broken [[tooth]].
