He offers you a place by his side.|Tych\u00e9 to [[Gavyn Sykes]]|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\n'''Adela Tych\u00e9''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] and a skilled [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]]. She [[Nal Raka Criminal Empire|worked]] for [[Borvo]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] around the time of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]] and temporarily joined the [[Naboo Resistance|Naboo resistance]] before Borvo betrayed the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo people]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Nice knowing you, soldier boy. Open fire!|Tych\u00e9 taunting Sykes before giving orders to other mercenaries|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\nDuring her early [[Standard year/Legends|years]], she traveled extensively, strengthening her [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]] and fighting abilities. She also learned to speak many different [[Language/Legends|languages]], including [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] and [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]]. Those skills as a translator and advisor impressed [[Borvo]], who soon [[Nal Raka Criminal Empire|employed]] her as his personal pilot and bodyguard.\n\nDuring the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], Borvo allied with the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Naboo Security Forces]] after they [[Mission to the Naboo mountains|rescued him]] from [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] forces. Tych\u00e9 was on hand to translate Borvo's gratitude to the [[Officer/Legends|officers]]. She went on to fly [[Disruption of Comm 4|several]] [[Attack on disabled base|missions]] alongside [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Kael (officer)|Kael]] and [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Gavyn Sykes]], using an [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1]] against the [[Trade Federation Droid Army/Legends|droid army]] and helped [[Liberation of slave camps|free captured slaves]]. Borvo then betrayed the Security Forces by selling the rescued [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] in secret and [[Search for Captain Kael|shot down]] Kael to cover his tracks. Tych\u00e9 joined the Hutt in his base on [[Porso Hill]], and took control of his [[Borvo the Hutt's freighter|personal transport]]. Sykes [[Attack on Porso Hill|attacked]] Borvo's freighter in revenge and she taunted the Naboo pilot. Tych\u00e9 subsequently escaped with Borvo back to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] in the cockpit module when Sykes destroyed the ship.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Captain Kael, the shield is noticeably weaker. My shots are finally having an effect.|Tych\u00e9 to Captain Kael during the mission to disrupt Comm 4.|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\nAdela Tych\u00e9 was capable of flying a number of craft, and also spoke [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] and [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]]. She was prone to taunting those she fought against.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAdela Tych\u00e9 was voiced by [[Susan Zelinsky]] in the [[2000]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tych\u00e9, Adela}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Nal Raka Criminal Empire]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Translators and interpreters]]"}}}]}}}}
