And you will understand that I am not a traitor, but a visionary! Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hatred leads to suffering. But what the Jedi failed to teach you, what I have learned, is how to persevere, to pass ''through'' the suffering, and achieve ultimate power!|Dooku, to Quinlan Vos|Dark Disciple}}\n[[Count of Serenno|Count]] '''Dooku''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Serennian]] [[human]] [[Gender|male]], was a [[Jedi Master]] that fell to the [[dark side of the Force]] and became the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] '''Darth Tyranus''' during the [[Republic Era|final years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. After [[Lost Twenty|leaving]] the [[Jedi Order]], he served as [[Head of State]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He was the second [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] of [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] whose plan to conquer [[the galaxy]] relied on Dooku leading a pan-[[Galaxy|galactic]] [[Separatist Crisis|secessionist movement]] against the Republic. As such, Dooku immersed himself in the dark side and worked tirelessly to advance his and his [[Sith Master|master's]] plans, but ultimately forgot that treachery was the way of the [[Sith]].\n\n[[Reproduction|Born]] in [[102 BBY]] during the [[High Republic Era]], Dooku was taken by the [[Jedi]] Order after being abandoned by his [[House Serenno|family]] and [[Jedi training|learned]] the Jedi arts as the [[Padawan]] of [[Yoda]], the legendary [[Grand Master]] of the Jedi Order. A [[Politics|political]] idealist, the corruption in the [[Galactic Senate]]&mdash;as well as the [[Jedi Code|traditions of the Jedi]]&mdash;disillusioned him, causing Dooku to voluntarily leave the Order and return to his [[homeworld]], where he reclaimed his title of [[Count]] and [[House Serenno|heritage]] as a [[noble]]man after [[Invasion of Serenno|overthrowing]] his corrupt brother [[Ramil]]. His former peers believed his decision was misguided but still held him in high esteem. Unknown to the Jedi, however, Dooku not only renounced their ways but his commitment to the [[light side of the Force]] as well. Having sworn his allegiance to [[Darth]] Sidious, Dooku became the Dark [[Lord]]'s apprentice and adopted the secret name of Darth Tyranus. Throughout the first [[Standard decade|decade]] of Sheev Palpatine's [[Supreme Chancellor|chancellery]], Dooku used his resources and charisma to recruit entire [[star system]]s to the Separatist cause. At the same [[time]], he oversaw the development of two vast [[Army|armies]] that would be pitted against each other in the conflict to come: the [[Separatist Droid Army]], which consisted entirely of [[battle droid]]s manufactured on [[Geonosis]]; and the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], composed by [[clone trooper]]s [[Cloning|bred]] on [[Kamino]] and [[Clone template|modeled]] on the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]].\n\nAfter [[Standard year|years]] of maneuvering the galaxy into a state of war, the Clone Wars began when the newly formed [[Republic Military]] [[First Battle of Geonosis|invaded Geonosis]] in [[22 BBY]]. As leader of the Separatists, Dooku delegated [[Confederacy military|military]] authority to a cadre of subordinates personally trained by himself, including [[General]] [[Grievous]] and [[Asajj Ventress]]. While Grievous was trained only in the art of [[lightsaber combat]], Ventress was [[Midi-chlorian|strong]] with [[the Force]], affording her the opportunity to learn the ways of the dark side from Dooku. The Sith, however, remained faithful to [[Darth Bane]]'s [[Rule of Two]]; and as such, Dooku was compelled to betray his disciple after Sidious became suspicious of his own apprentice's intentions. Though he sought to replace Ventress with [[Savage Opress]] and later [[Quinlan Vos]], Dooku ultimately remained beholden to his master's will, which would eventually be his undoing. By the third year of the war, Dooku and Grievous succeeded in abducting Chancellor Palpatine (per Sidious's plan) from the Republic [[capital]] of [[Coruscant]] in [[19 BBY]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Coruscant]], he was [[Lightsaber duel|confronted]] and defeated by the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], who summarily [[Death penalty|executed]] the Count via [[Death|beheading]] at the Chancellor's behest. In the [[Standard day|days]] following Dooku's [[death]], Palpatine revealed to the Jedi that he was, in fact, Darth Sidious, who betrayed his apprentice in order to replace him with the younger and more powerful Skywalker. With the subsequent [[Great Jedi Purge|fall of the Jedi Order]], Sidious consolidated his power upon [[Proclamation of the New Order|declaring]] himself [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. As for Skywalker, he succeeded the late Darth Tyranus as Sidious' third and last apprentice, resulting in his transformation into Darth Vader and proving his slain victim's words of sensing fear, hate and anger.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n====Jedi induction and initiation====\nDooku was [[Reproduction|born]] in [[102 BBY]] during the [[High Republic Era]],<ref name=\"Birth Date\" /> on the [[planet]] [[Serenno]] to the planet's ruler, [[Count of Serenno|Count]] [[Gora]], and his [[Marriage|wife]], [[Count]]ess [[Anya (Serenno)|Anya]]. Rapidly, the [[Youngling|child's]] [[Force-sensitive|Force-sensitivity]] manifested, scaring his [[Parent|father]], who hated and feared those he dismissed as \"freaks.\" Gora contacted the [[Jedi Order]] and told them to take his son. However, instead of waiting for the [[Jedi seeker]]s to arrive, Gora abandoned the infant outside his palace on the edges of the forest without [[Clothing|clothes]] or any form of identification. A seeker rescued Dooku before he froze to [[death]] or was eaten by [[spine-wolves]], and brought the child to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Grand Temple]] on [[Coruscant]].<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\n====Life as a youngling====\n[[File:Temple_Sacrifice.png|thumb|left|250px|Dooku was raised in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he learned the ways of the Force alongside other younglings.]]\nDooku was integrated into [[Hawkbat Clan]] alongside fellow younglings [[Zang Arraira]], [[Arath Tarrex]], and [[Sifo-Dyas]], under the direction of the [[Jedi Master]] [[Tera Sinube]]. During his [[time]] as a [[Jedi Initiate|Jedi youngling]], he continuously strove to excel, working himself hard to achieve better results than his peers and always striving to remain within the boundaries of the rules set by his teachers. Dooku therefore distanced himself from the other younglings rather than try to befriend them. His talents made him clash with fellow youngling Arath, largely due to the latter's jealousy over Dooku's superior abilities. Arath frequently insulted Dooku, calling him 'His Excellency' due to his imperious and somewhat aristocratic manner. Dooku and Sifo-Dyas were close friends during their time as younglings, and on one occasion<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" /> in [[90 BBY]]{{Fact}} accompanied [[Grand Master]] Yoda and Masters Sinube and [[Yula Braylon]] to Serenno for the [[Celebration on Serenno|galactic festival]] being held there with other Jedi in tow.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nAs the Masters were demonstrating the proper lightsaber stances, a pair of children set off some thunderburst caps and ran off, Dooku thought he recognized one of them and followed them out to the fairgrounds. There he found the two being harassed by a trio of thugs that were threatening to kidnap them, Dooku used his Force powers and an electroblade to force the criminals to back off. Afterwards the pair introduced themselves as [[Jenza]] and [[Ramil]], though the later was less than thankful for the Jedi's assistance. When she learned Dooku was from Serenno, Jenza offered to give Dooku a tour of the homeworld he never knew.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nThey explored the celebration together playing games and tasting the food, becoming fast friends as they got to know each other. Eventually Jenza took Dooku to the [[Great Assembly]], where she showed him the seals of the seven houses and told him the legend of how her ancestors liberated the planet from the Sith Empire. Though before they could leave Dooku felt drawn to an ancient carving of a beast, that was identified by Jenza as a [[Tirra'Taka]]. Ignoring her warning that it was bad luck, he moved to touch it, and as his finger brushed the stone, a [[groundquake]] caused the building around them to collapse.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nThough Dooku attempted to lift the debris off of them himself, it took the intervention of Master Yoda to free the the two from the rubble. Once the other Masters helped the Grand Master remove the collapsed structure from the area, Count Gora of Serenno furiously confronted Yoda when he heard Dooku's name being voiced, yelling at the Jedi that he never wished to see his son again. It was here that the young Jedi learned that Gora was his Father and Jenza his sister.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nShocked and confused by his father's behavior, Dooku later questioned Yoda about how he was brought into the Jedi Order. The elder Jedi  revealed that Gora had contacted the Jedi upon discovering his son's Force-sensitivity, and that he had left Dooku outside his castle walls without clothes or identification. Dooku would learn shortly after that being left on the edge of the forest put him at risk of being eaten alive by [[Spine-wolf|spine-wolves]] had he not been found. Upon arriving back at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, his injuries were quickly healed and the young Jedi quickly threw himself back into his training. Dooku using this practice to vent his frustrations at Count Gora for abandoning him, and furthermore to think deeply about what he might have been if he had never become a Jedi. At this time an attendant arrived with a communications devise that would allow him to speak to his sister, and they stayed in contact for many years.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nSome [[88 BBY|two years later]], after a lesson in the Jedi Archives Sifo-Dyas revealed to Dooku he had come into possession of the journal of  the expelled Jedi [[Klias Teradine]], which revealed to him the existence of the [[Bogan Collection]] inside the Jedi Archives. His friend convinced him that they should break in to see the dark side artifacts, and Dooku used sand levitation to get past the magnetic lock. There they witnessed many dark objects, weapons and scrolls the Jedi had collected over their history. Dooku in particular was drawn to a piece of metal that seemed to connect him to the same Tirra'Taka he had first encountered on Serenno. This frightened the boy, who lashed out through the Force and accidentally threw Sifo-Dyas through a cabinet, alerting the Chief Librarian, [[Restelly Quist]], to the goings on.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nThe two initiates were brought to the infirmary where Sifo's injuries were treated, and they were confronted by Masters Yoda and Braylon, who each expressed a deep disappointment in how they had broken the rules and betrayed their trust. As the Masters were lecturing them, their discussion was interrupted by the arrival of [[Lene Kostana]], who expressed great concern over the security of the Bogan Collection since two younglings had been able to break in. Dooku and Sifo-Dyas watched the Masters debate their conflicting views on how best to train the next generation to confront the Dark Side, and afterwards they were assigned to decipher the [[Lothal Papyri]], a collection of agricultural treatises, under the watchful eyes of Librarian Quist. As they served their penance they had another encounter with Lene Kostana who was surprised that Yoda was still using the same treatises as punishment for misbehaved younglings, and playfully referred to the Grand Master as a goblin which offended Dooku. As she left Sifo-Dyas discovered she slipped him a book: ''[[The Bestiary of Darth Caldoth]]''. Dooku encouraged his friend to tell someone about the text, but Sifo refused.\n\nThis event greatly disturbed Dooku who began to think Master Kostana might secretly be a Sith, one day he confronted her on the [[contemplation balcony]] demanding to know why she gave his friend the Sith script. She said the book was a test, though Dooku sensed a great deal of frustration and anger in her which he believed legitimized his theory. The two engaged in a short duel, during which Master Kostana played an act of goading him on, using the tale of [[Darth Sakia]] as a lesson by comparing Dooku's [[curved-hilt lightsaber]] to the fictional Sith's weapon, and revealing she was aware of Dooku's curious connection to the Tirra'Taka. Unfortunately Kostana quickly lost control of the situation as Dooku began a frenzy of attacks that began wearing down her defenses. Their fight was broken up by the timely intervention of Master Yoda who calmed the initiate down and convinced him that he had jumped to conclusions. The Grand Master then chided the Altiri on her constant need to test the initiates by exposing them to dark side artifacts. Following this event Dooku began to spend more time with Master Kostana, as he started to look to her as a mentor figure, since he took a great deal of interest in her work studying the dark side, her theories concerning the Sith, and even her pet [[convor]] Ferana, he visted her nearly every time she returned to the Temple following her missions.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\n====The Grand Master's apprentice====\n{{Quote|Master Yoda has come to Moraband, although why, I do not know. We shall, however, use the strong bond that once existed between you and your master to allow us to see things that we otherwise could not.|Darth Sidious to Dooku|Sacrifice}}\n[[File:Dooku_Yoda_Younglings.png|thumb|right|250px|At one time, Dooku was the Padawan of Yoda, the Grand Master of the Jedi Order.]]\nIn [[86 BBY]],{{Fact}} Dooku later completed his [[Initiate Trials]] and hoped to be selected as the Padawan apprentice to Lene Kostana due to her mission in hunting down relics associated with the dark side. During the Padawan Tournament, Dooku fought and defeated Sifo-Dyas in a duel with one hand behind his back and blindfolded. However, Kostana selected Sifo-Dyas as her apprentice which upset Dooku, though this disappointment subsided when he learned that Yoda had decided to take him as his apprentice. On one occasion, Yoda took Dooku on a voyage to [[Lahsbane]] in the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] as part of his training.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" /> During a mission to [[Kashyyyk]], Dooku watched as his master faced a giant [[Terentatek]].<ref name=\"Destiny\" />\n\n====Sifo-Dyas's vision====\n{{Quote|Sifo-Dyas understood.

''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]'' establishes that Dooku was 80 years old during the [[First Battle of Geonosis]], dated to [[22 BBY]] by ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'', which places Dooku's [[Reproduction|birth]] in [[102 BBY]]. Thus, the solar storm must have occurred in 85 BBY.</ref> Dooku's friend Sifo-Dyas received a [[Force vision]] of a deadly solar storm hitting the planet [[Protobranch]]. After informing the Jedi Council, Dooku supported Sifo-Dyas and Kostana's suggestion that they warn the planet, but was forbidden to by Yoda and the Council, who pointed out that Force visions were not absolute and the future was always in motion.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nFrustrated with the Council, Dooku, Kostana and Sifo-Dyas went behind the Council's back to inform [[Tavetti]], the senator who represented Protobranch, of the vision. During the conversation, Dooku was slightly unnerved by Tavetti only expressing concern for Protobranch's resources rather than its people. Afterwards, Dooku, Kostana, Sifo-Dyas and a reluctant Yoda went to the planet itself. Ultimately, Sifo-Dyas's vision came to pass; a [[Protobranch solar storm|powerful solar storm hit Protobranch]], killing much of the population, with the Jedi themselves barely surviving.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nThe events with Protobranch shook Dooku's respect for the Republic and the Jedi Council, feeling the latter was somewhat responsible for the deaths that occurred by not taking Sifo-Dyas's vision seriously and refusing to act quicker. He was also disgusted by the fact that the Republic's primary concern was the loss of Protobranch's resources and not its inhabitants.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\n====Funeral of Anya====\nIn [[82 BBY]],<ref name=\"82 BBY\">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]'' gives the age of Dooku at the [[time]] of the [[First Battle of Geonosis]] as eighty [[Standard year|years]] old. ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the Battle of [[Geonosis]] to [[22 BBY]], placing Dooku's [[Reproduction|birth]] year in [[102 BBY]]. The [[Dooku: Jedi Lost (script)|script]] of ''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]'' states that Dooku is twenty years old during the [[Funeral of Countess Anya|funeral]] of [[Count]]ess [[Anya (Serenno)|Anya]], meaning that the [[funeral]] must have occurred in [[82 BBY]].</ref> a twenty year old Dooku attended the funeral of his mother, Anya, on Serenno. It was here that his father Gora physically and verbally assaulted him, referring to his son as a \"freak.\" Shortly afterward, Dooku joined Sifo-Dyas and his master Kostana on a [[Mission to Asusto|mission]] to track down a relic on [[Asusto]]. However, the pair were ambushed by the [[Presagers of Hakotei]] and Dooku was briefly captured to be used as part of a dark side ritual. It was during his brief captivity that he experienced a series of [[Force vision|visions]] of his future, and he used [[Force lightning]] for the first time in order to kill his captors. After which Master Kostana and Sifo-Dyas taught him a [[Ritual of the Three|cleansing ritual]] involving arm wrappings that was designed to keep him centered in the force.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\n===Jedi Master===\n====Attaining the rank====\n{{Quote|You know, My Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

On the evening of Qui-Gon being assigned to him, Jinn presented himself to his new Master in Dooku's quarters, Dooku observed that Jinn was frightened. After a moment of silence, and pressing him, Jinn confessed that he was. He asked his apprentice why and after looking into himself through the fear, Jinn answered that he was not afraid of Dooku, but of not becoming a Jedi, that he was afraid of failing. Of not being worthy. Dooku then summarized it as Jinn being afraid of himself, of a future not being the one he wanted. Jinn confirmed it, fearing that Dooku will reject him for his apparent cowardice. Dooku instead said that it was very wise, surprising Jinn. Smiling, he would explain that most Padawans would deny their fear, and even if they admitted it, they would not have Jinn's self-knowledge. He then further praised Jinn for his honesty, insight, and intelligence.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nTo help Jinn understand the Jedi Temple more completely, Dooku decided to take him throughout most of the Temple, including the Padawans' sparring dojo, and the one for full Jedi Knights, and the [[Great Assembly Room]]. Their last stop was the Jedi Archives, where they examined [[holocron]]s of various eras, not to study them, but simply for Jinn to learn his way around. While doing so, a particularly old holocron, more ancient and of a different shape than the rest, caught Jinn's eye. When he questioned his Master about it, he was shocked by the expression on Dooku's face, almost as if he considered it an enemy. Dooku answered that it was a holocron of Jedi prophecies. Jinn asked if there are Jedi prophets, to which Dooku replied not any longer. He explained to Jinn that the mystics sought undue knowledge of the future which led them down dangerous paths. Those drawn too deeply into them were often tempted by the dark side. Dooku then finished by saying that is why the Jedi study prophecy no longer, then turned to leave, which meant Jinn had to follow. Jinn then asked Dooku if just wanting to know the future can lead to the dark side. Dooku simply replied that it takes more than that.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nAfter training Qui-Gon for several months the Council sent him with his apprentice to [[Shurrupak]] to participate in a battle on its surface, which was Qui-Gon's very first. When they landed on the surface the encountered his first apprentice, Rael Aveross, whom Dooku introduced to his new apprentice.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nQui-Gon Jinn eventually graduated to Knighthood and became a Master himself, and took a Padawan of his own: Obi-Wan Kenobi.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Dooku maintained some contact with Jinn, who spoke very highly about his apprentice Kenobi to his former master.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n===Leaving the Jedi Order===\n{{Quote|The Jedi have been my family since I was a child, the Temple my home.

In the ensuring battle, Dooku killed Ramil.<ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" />\n\nReclaiming the title of Count of Serenno after killing his brother, Dooku also took possession of his family fortune, one of the largest in the galaxy. Believing his people needed him, Dooku decided he needed to leave the Jedi to lead Serenno, feeling it was his responsibility after all his brother had done. Furthermore, the people of the planet had found new resources, which they could produce themselves. The Republic offered to help with the resources despite having previously decided the Abyssin crisis was an internal affair. Dooku rejected the Republic's aid, deciding the recovery of Serenno would also be an internal affair.

The most important project that he oversaw during that time was the creation of a [[Grand Army of the Republic|clone army]] intended for use by the Republic during the planned war. According to what Dooku later claimed, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who was greatly troubled by the Republic's tumultuous political situation and the Jedi Council's apparent complacency, helped Dooku order a clone army from the [[Kaminoan]]s, which Dyas hoped to hold in reserve in case of civil war. After this was done, Dooku needed to make certain that Sifo-Dyas would remain silent about the army. As such, he contacted [[Lom Pyke]] of the [[Pyke Syndicate]] and instructed him to murder Sifo-Dyas by way of shooting down his shuttle during a mission, after which Dooku was given Sifo-Dyas's body.<ref name=\"The Lost 1\">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>\n\nDooku took Dyas's body to the planet [[Felucia]], which was in the midst of a conflict<ref name=\"Creation of the Clone Army\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-inside-intel-the-creation-of-the-clone-army|text=''Star Wars'' Inside Intel: The Creation of the Clone Army|int=Star Wars Inside Intel: The Creation of the Clone Army}}</ref> the Jedi had ordered Dyas to [[Mission to Felucia (pre\u2013Naboo Crisis)|stop]].

Dooku informed Sidious of this complication and told him find out why Jak'zin was there. At dinner, Dooku denied rumors that he was creating another order of force users and assured Jak'zin that he was looking after his family's business interest on Serenno. Following dinner, Dooku followed Jak'zin and learned about the mission of learning about the [[Kaldana Syndicate]]. Dooku agreed to help Jak'zin on his mission. The two made their way into the syndicate's base. There, Dooku and Jak'zin discovered that the syndicate was smuggling weapons and were surrounded by the syndicate's gang.

Gunray accepted the offer; Dooku thus dispatched Jango Fett to carry out Amidala's assassination. Despite the failure of Fett's mission, Dooku was able to have the Trade Federation, the Banking Clan, the Techno Union, the Commerce Guild, and the Corporate Alliance all sign his treaty on Geonosis, formalizing the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Kenobi overheard their discussion, but was captured by droidekas while transmitting his findings back to the Republic. Dooku visited Kenobi in his [[prison]] cell, feigning shock at the Jedi's capture and inquiring as to his presence on Geonosis. Denying involvement with the bounty hunters, Dooku instead spoke of his former apprentice, Qui-Gon, suggesting that Jinn would have joined Dooku's movement had he learned the truth that the Sith were in control of the Senate.

Dooku engaged in a Force duel with his old master and, unable to best him, challenged Yoda to a lightsaber battle. The fighting was fierce but brief, and cut short when Dooku brought down a pillar over Kenobi and Skywalker, forcing Yoda to break off his attack to save them.

During the public  banquet, Asajj took the opportunity to meet up with Dooku and challenge him to a duel at the overlook nearby. Dooku   agreed but secretly contacted Grievous for reinforcements. However, Vos anticipated this and managed to lock Grievous in a room.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nTogether, Ventress and Vos [[Mission to Raxus Secundus|confronted]] Dooku at the overlook. After exchanging pleasantries over a glass of [[Alderaanian wine]], Dooku engaged the assassins in a lightsaber duel. Using his mastery of the dark side, Dooku overpowered the two assassins and used the Force to hurl them against some nearby pillars. Despite Vos's best efforts, he was unable to best Dooku and was taken captive by the Sith Lord. Ventress managed to escape following a scuffle with Grievous but was unable to rescue her lover Vos. Dooku then struck Vos unconscious with Force lightning and spirited his Jedi captive away to his palace on Serenno.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n[[File:DookuVilla-Nightsisters.png|thumb|left|250px|Vos was captured and taken to Dooku's castle on Serenno, where the Jedi was turned to the dark side of the Force.]]\nOn Serenno, Count Dooku [[torture]]d Quinlan Vos for a prolonged period. To sow discord between Vos and Ventress, he showed the Jedi Master a hologram of Ventress [[Battle of unidentified planet (Tholme and Ventress)|killing]] his former Master [[Tholme]]. When Vos initially refused to believe Dooku's account, the Sith Lord presented Vos with Tholme's lightsaber. Using his [[Psychometry|psychometric]] abilities, Vos realized that Dooku was telling the truth. Shortly later, Ventress and Boba Fett's [[Krayt's Claw|bounty hunter syndicate]] launched a [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|mission]] to rescue Vos. However, they were forced to flee empty-handed after Vos, who had given in to the dark side, attacked Ventress. Following the attack, Vos became Dooku's new Sith apprentice. Despite turning to the dark side, Vos secretly planned to force Dooku to lead him to his master, Darth Sidious, and then kill the two Sith Lords.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n====Search for Maul====\n{{Quote|I left you here to make you an offer.

Dooku then spoke with Talzin, warning that betraying Sidious would be a folly. Talzin told him that Sidious was ready to replace him with a new apprentice. She then revealed to Dooku how Sidious came to her promising to make her his right hand but betrayed her when he took Maul. She also revealed that Maul was her son. When the Republic forces boarded their ship, Dooku decided to assist Maul in killing the Jedi, but not before secretly freeing Grievous. Together they [[Assault on Vizsla Keep 09|fought]] [[Jedi General]]s, Mace Windu, [[Aayla Secura]], Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Tiplee.

Vos quickly gained the moniker \"[[Admiral]] Enigma\" among the Republic media. After receiving intelligence from Admiral [[Wullf Yularen]] that Dooku was planning to attack the planet [[Taris]], the Jedi Council hatched a [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|mission to rescue]] Quinlan Vos. With the help of Ventress, Kenobi and his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker infiltrated Dooku's [[Providence-class Dreadnought|''Providence''-class Dreadnought]] and made their way to the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]], hoping to encounter \"Admiral Enigma.\" Instead, they encountered Dooku. While Skywalker dueled with Dooku, Ventress and Kenobi managed to \"rescue\" Vos from his cell. However, Vos and Dooku had anticipated the rescue and arranged for Vos to appear in an emaciated state. While Ventress sensed that Vos had turned to the dark side, his Jedi colleagues eagerly welcomed Vos home.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nQuinlan Vos's \"rescue\" gave Count Dooku a high-level spy within the Jedi Order. Using his high-placed position within the Jedi hierarchy, Vos leaked intelligence on two Republic operations to Dooku. This allowed the Separatists to sabotage an asteroid supplies warehouse and to evacuate [[Vanqor listening post|a]] [[listening post]] on Vanqor prior to a Republic [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|attack]]. After discerning that Vos had turned to the dark side, the Jedi Council sent Vos on a mission to kill Dooku. With the help of Ventress, Vos and the Jedi learned that Dooku's dreadnought was last sighted above the crystal-covered planet of Christophsis. Vos managed to infiltrate Dooku's dreadnought and engaged the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel. Despite besting Dooku, Vos refused to kill him and instead demanded that Dooku lead him to Darth Sidious.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nUnknown to both Dooku and Vos, they had been tailed by Kenobi and Skywalker. The two Jedi Knights promptly arrested Dooku and his apprentice and transported them to the [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Vigilance (Venator-class)|''Vigilance'']] as prisoners. While being marched to the ''Vigilance's'' brig, Vos managed to free Dooku, who in turned freed Vos. After killing the Jedi Knights [[Akar-Deshu]] and [[Kav Bayons]] and two dozen Clone troopers, the two dark siders escaped the ''Vigilance'' aboard Ventress's ship [[Banshee (starship)|''Banshee'']]. Ventress attempted to fly them back to Dooku's dreadnought but they were shot down by the ''Vigilance'' and crash-landed on Christophsis.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n[[File:Asajj_Ventress_Kindred_Spirits.png|thumb|left|200px|Ventress's sacrifice undermined Dooku's plans for Vos, who reclaimed his status as a Jedi.]]\nDooku and his fellow travelers survived the crash but the Count sustained a serious injury since he had not been properly strapped in. After navigating through Christophsis's crystal-covered landscape, they managed to reach a local [[Christophsis Separatist tower|Separatist base]] that was built into a giant crystal tower. Upon arriving, Dooku was informed that Darth Sidious was seeking an audience with him. During a brief hologram conversation, Dooku requested help from his master to get offworld. Shortly later, Kenobi and Skywalker launched a [[Second battle of Christophsis|full-scale assault]] on the Separatist base.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nTogether, Dooku and his opponents made their way into an outlying crystal sanctum. On the way, Dooku was struck by a blaster blast and was knocked unconscious. While Ventress wanted to let him die, Vos insisted on keeping him alive. While Vos assisted the battle droids in the defense of the base, Ventress moved Dooku into the crystal sanctum. After stirring, Dooku taunted Ventress by deriding her as a \"grant\" and claiming that Vos had much potential as a Sith Lord. Ventress responded that Vos had \"bigger plans\" for Dooku. When Vos entered the sanctum, Ventress confronted him about his decision to join Dooku and the dark side.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nWhile Ventress and Vos were preoccupied, Dooku took the opportunity to attack his former pupils with Force lightning. He wanted to kill Vos, but ended up striking Ventress, who pushed Vos out of the way. Though Quinlan managed to stop Dooku, Ventress was mortally wounded. Dooku then attempted to goad Vos into killing him, but realizing that the act of murder led to the dark side, Vos refused and reaffirmed his Jedi identity. While Vos comforted his dying lover, Dooku took the opportunity to rendezvous with Sidious's starship and fled off-world. Despite failing to kill Dooku, Vos was pardoned by the Jedi Council after he rejected the dark side and continued serving the Jedi war effort.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n====Death====\n{{Quote|You did well, Anakin.

Dooku held Chancellor Palpatine captive aboard General Grievous's flagship, the ''[[Invisible Hand]]''. When Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi made their way to the bridge where the Chancellor was being held in an attempt to rescue him, Dooku arrived and confronted the two Jedi, flanked by two super battle droids. He engaged them in a brief, but fierce lightsaber duel.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nDuring the duel, Dooku defeated Kenobi, who was incapacitated and knocked unconscious when the Count used the Force to pin Kenobi to the ground with a metal balcony. He then took the opportunity to mock and goad Skywalker, saying that the young Jedi knight had great fear, hate and anger in him, but was refusing to use them. However, Dooku was soon overpowered by an angered Skywalker, who, with one slash of his lightsaber, severed both the Count's hands at the wrists. Skywalker then caught Dooku's lightsaber out of the air and crossed it with his own blade at the Count's throat. Palpatine praised Anakin, but then betrayed Dooku by telling Anakin to kill him. Although Dooku was Horrified and in disbelief by the Chancellor's and his own master's order, though he remained silent. Skywalker was initially hesitant to kill Dooku because killing an unarmed prisoner was not the Jedi way. However, when Palpatine ordered Skywalker to kill him, he drew the two lightsabers together, decapitating the leader of the Confederacy, much to his own reluctance<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|At the time I thought Dooku was an old fool.

During his time as a Jedi he was known as one of the Order's finest swordsmen; it was said that only Yoda was his superior and that Mace Windu was his only worthy opponent. On Geonosis, Dooku was able to easily defeat both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker one immediately after the other, and then go on to fight Yoda himself. Dooku proved able to compete with Yoda but was unable to defeat his former master and was forced to retreat. He would often prove to be equal and even superior to Anakin and Kenobi even as their skill grew during the Clone Wars, dueling Anakin on several occasions to a stalemate and even both simultaneously on at least one occasion.{{Fact}}\n\nAmong the most skilled swordsmen [[the galaxy]] had ever seen, Dooku was a practitioner of the second form of lightsaber combat, [[Form II|Makashi]].

The style's rarity gave Dooku an advantage when engaging in lightsaber duels, as few of his enemies were trained to defend themselves against it.

He demonstrated great prowess and strength in the use of telekinesis. During his duels with Ventress and his escape from Hondo's pirates, he displayed great skill at using telekinesis in finer, more precise tasks, such as disarming Ventress while also levitating her against a wall during her failed attempt to kill him with Savage Oppress.

Rowling's head was digitally replaced with Lee's during post-production.<ref name=\"Episode II Cast and Crew\">{{SWArchive|url=episode-ii/bts/castcrew.html|text=Episode II Cast and Crew|archivedate=20050602031927}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AoR-CountDooku-Power-textless.png|thumb|left|180px|Concept art of Dooku by Dermot Power]]\nDooku's character underwent multiple development iterations during the creative process of ''Attack of the Clones''; artists [[Iain McCaig]] and [[Dermot Power]] experimented with various female Sith designs, including dark queens, robotic warriors, and vampiric witches as well as a shape-shifting alien concept that eventually evolved into [[Zam Wesell]], until [[George Lucas]] eventually decided on the idea of a battle-scarred Jedi warrior who parted ways with the Jedi Order. The final designs of the character were intended to reflect the menacing atmosphere conveyed by [[Peter Cushing]]'s portrayal of [[Grand Moff]] Wilhuff Tarkin in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name=\"old-db-bts\">{{DB|character|countdooku|Dooku, Count|archivedate=20110524223804}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Lee reprised his role in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]], while [[Corey Burton]] voiced Dooku in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|subsequent TV series]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n===Character origins===\nThe name \"Dooku\" was based on the [[Wikipedia:Japanese language|Japanese]] word \"doku,\" meaning poison.<ref name=\"Lord of Misrule: The Autobiography of Christopher Lee\">[[Christopher Lee#Recent Bibliography|''Lord of Misrule: The Autobiography of Christopher Lee'']]</ref> In the [[Wikipedia:Galician language|Galician]] and [[Wikipedia:Portuguese language|Portuguese]] languages, \"do cu,\" pronounced exactly as in \"Dooku,\" means \"from the ass\" or \"of the ass.\" For this reason, Dooku's name was changed to \"Dookan\" in [[Wikipedia:Brazil|Brazil]].<ref name=\"Globo\">{{Cite_web|url=http://epoca.globo.com/especiais/starwars/pers.htm|title=Star Wars Personagens|publisher=Editora Globo|archivedate=20060901220835}}</ref>\n\n''Tyranus''&mdash;or more properly, ''Tyrannos''&mdash;is an ancient [[Wikipedia:Greek language|Greek]] word, originally used to describe someone who ruled a city-state after overthrowing the preexisting government. It was a legitimate form of government and the word's meaning was not unfavorable in itself, but over time, as democracy developed, it gained negative connotations and came to mean \"oppressor\" or \"tyrant.\"<ref name=\"Tyrant\">{{WP|Tyrant}}</ref>\n\n===Discrepancies===\n[[Age of Republic - Count Dooku 1|''Age of Republic - Count Dooku'' 1]], ''[[Master & Apprentice]]'', and ''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]'' all establish that Dooku left the Jedi before Qui-Gon Jinn's death.<ref name=\"Count Dooku 1\" /><ref name=\"Dooku: Jedi Lost\" /><ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> However, the [[2019]] [[Fantasy Flight Games]] sourcebook ''[[Rise of the Separatists]]'' states that Dooku credited Jinn's death as his reason for leaving the Order.<ref name=\"Rise\" /> As ''Rise of the Separatists'' is only a roleplaying sourcebook, this article assumes ''Count Dooku'' 1, ''Master & Apprentice'', and ''Jedi Lost'' are correct.\n\nDuring a question session for [[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions|''The Clone Wars'': The Lost Missions]], [[Dave Filoni]] revealed that Darth Sidious had Dooku and Maul as Sith apprentices concurrently.<ref name=\"TCW Lost Missions Q&A\">{{SW|url=video/the-lost-missions-q-and-a-sifo-dyas-and-the-sith|text=The Lost Missions Q&A: Sifo Dyas and the Sith}}</ref> However, in the fifth slide of Sidious's [[Databank (website)|Databank]] biography gallery, it is established that the Sith Lord brought Dooku into the Sith Order sometime after becoming Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.
