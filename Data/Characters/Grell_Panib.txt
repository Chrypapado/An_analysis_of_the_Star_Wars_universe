He was a tumultuous youth, frequent getting into fights. After many run-ins with the law, he was conscripted into the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]]. While a good soldier, he still had trouble containing his anger, and was almost thrown out of the service twice for striking an [[Officer/Legends|officer]]. He was transferred to [[Bakura]] where he served the Imperial Commander there. Panib formerly served under [[Pter Thanas]], where he first met [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].<ref name=\"TTABS\" />\n\nFollowing the attempted [[Ssi-ruu]]vi invasion of Bakura in [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]] during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Panib took control of Bakura when [[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister]] [[Molierre Cundertol]] was abducted. Declaring martial law until Cundertol's return, Panib was forced to retain his emergency powers when it was revealed that Cundertol and [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Blaine Harris]] were working against efforts to join with the [[Keeramak]]. When the threat of Cundertol and Harris was quelled, Panib and [[Lwothin]], leader of the [[P'w'eck Emancipation Movement]], signed a treaty and entered into an alliance. Panib sent Bakuran ships to [[Lwhekk/Legends|Lwhekk]] to help with the liberation of the [[P'w'eck]].<ref name=\"TCSWE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nPanib had a short temper, and would frequently brawl when angered.
