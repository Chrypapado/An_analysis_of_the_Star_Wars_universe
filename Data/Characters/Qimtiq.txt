He was also the arranger of [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] [[Swoop racing/Legends|races]].\n\nHe provided information to [[Meetra Surik]] about the murder of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sullio]]. She talked to the soldiers in charge of the investigation, and four of them were [[Bahima]], [[Nikko]], [[Panar]], and [[Kiph]]. He was in a good mood because the Civil War was a boon to his business. He did not care how the war ended, so long as the soldiers would come to his cantina.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Qimtiq\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Quarren]]"}}}]}}}}
