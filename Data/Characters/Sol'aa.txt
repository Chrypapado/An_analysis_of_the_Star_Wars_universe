Sol'aa wore a white tunic, a blue [[Clothing/Legends|undertunic]], beige pants, gray [[Glove/Legends|gloves]], brown [[Boot/Legends|boots]], and a red [[Belt/Legends|belt]]. He understood [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] but [[Language/Legends|spoke]] in [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nWhile at the Enclave, he met the former [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who was [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] after [[Amnesia/Legends|losing]] his memories. Sol'aa recognized Revan as a proficient pazaak player and offered a game. When Revan asked him about his identity, Sol'aa was dismissive, hoping to maintain his privacy. Despite the attitude, he was still open to playing pazaak with Revan and offered to sell some of his cards. Revan defeated Sol'aa at pazaak five times, and the Twi'lek instead wagered some extra cards as he had run out of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quotetrans|The last game was closer than it seemed. Want to try it again?|Sol'aa upon defeating Revan at pazaak|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:GreenSolaa.png|thumb|right|130px|Sol'aa, as he appears in the Xbox version]]\nSol'aa appears as a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', developed by [[BioWare]]. If the player attempts to play pazaak without a deck, Sol'aa will provide one. The conversation with him is optional and does not progress the plot of the game or change the player's alignment. If the player defeats Sol'aa at pazaak five times in a row, the latter starts wagering cards as opposed to credits. Alternatively, the player could lose to Sol'aa, prompting him to ask if the former wants to try again. Interactions with Sol'aa become unavailable after the player finds three of the five [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Star Map]]s and boards the [[Leviathan (Interdictor-class cruiser)|''Leviathan'']], the [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] of [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]]. While the player is aboard the ''Leviathan'', the [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|attack on Dantooine]] commences, and the player is unable to return to the planet.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nIn the [[Xbox]] version of ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'', Sol'aa is green-skinned and gray-eyed.
