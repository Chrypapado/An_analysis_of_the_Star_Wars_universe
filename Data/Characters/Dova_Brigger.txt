She and her brother [[Kal Brigger|Kal]] shipped whatever they could find between [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] and other worlds; to do so, they flew a modified [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]] named [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Hardwired'']]. She used most of her profits to upgrade the [[Hyperdrive/Legends|Hyperdrive]]. This meant that they could make increasingly longer trips, eventually it became easy for them to ship freight to the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]]. They also started shipping different cargo, they started out with consumer goods but ended up shipping contraband including small weaponry and ammo.\n\nAccording to the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] they were noticed by the [[Organization|Smuggler's Confederacy of the Cularin System's]] leader: [[Nirama]]. He loaned them credits so they could upgrade ''Hardwired'' even more. However, he made them pledge to never work for [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]]; the siblings broke their promise a year later. Nirama soon put a price on their heads, Dova was captured by a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] and Nirama had her executed.\n\nIn [[18 BBY/Legends|18 BBY]] a mechanic named [[Bammy Decree/Legends|Bammy Decree]] found the [[Hanx-Wargel/Legends|Hanx-Wargel]] [[SuperFlow IV/Legends|SuperFlow IV]] [[Computer/Legends|Computer]] from the formerly known ''Hardwired'' while repairing it for [[Rej Taunt]]. He compiled a brief history of previous owners by cross-referencing the data in the flight computer with Holonet entries.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']] {{1stm|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon (audiobook)|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Millennium Falcon Owner's Workshop Manual]]''\n*[[\"Millennium Falcon\" SpecPlate]]\n*[[\"Millennium Falcon\" TechPlate]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dova Brigger\n|ja=\u30c9\u30f4\u30a1\u30fb\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brigger, Dova}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
