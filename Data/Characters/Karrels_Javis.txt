While working on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], he had fallen out of favor after a series of mishaps for which he received the blame, elevating Javis' [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] rival, [[Toth'lazhen]], to prominence in Nem'ro's clan.\n\nThe [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]], seeking to convince Nem'ro to abandon his neutral business dealings and join with them, dispatched [[Cipher Nine|a battle-trained agent]] of [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]] to infiltrate Nem'ro's inner circle. In the guise of the pirate known as the \"[[Red Blade]]\", the Agent aided Javis in regaining his favor in the eyes of the Hutt. As the mission progressed, the Agent kept in touch with the spymaster known as \"[[Keeper (Imperial Intelligence)|Keeper]]\" back on the Imperial homeworld of [[Dromund Kaas]].\n\nAs the mission progressed, Keeper revealed that Javis' sons [[Serjil Javis|Serjil]] and [[Vargai Javis|Vargai]], who were flying the merchant lanes, got into conflict with a Sith, resulting in Serjil's death and Vargai being left severely crippled. Knowing this would affect Javis' willingness to support the Empire, Keeper ordered the Agent to eliminate Javis and to implicate Nem'ro's Hutt rival, [[Voontara Fa'athra]], in the murder. Continuing this mission, the Agent was able to plant evidence that Fa'athra had been behind Javis' assassination, with the aid of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the time of the [[Great Galactic War]], Karrels was part of a gang that were a threat to Nem'ro when he was thirteen. After watching his friends die, Javis held a grudge against the Hutts.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Coruscant]] which led to the first [[Standard year/Legends|year]] of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], Karrels started to work with Nem'ro the Hutt on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. However, while he was working with the crime boss, he began to fall out of favor after a series of mishaps by his rival, [[Toth'lazhen]]. Javis always hated Toth'lazhen, but always kept his mouth shut for years.\n\nIn [[3643 BBY]], the final year of the war, Karrels continued his job when the Empire sought to convince Nem'ro the Hutt to abandon his neutral business dealings and serve as loyal allies. Karrels refused to join the Empire, but was forced to take action while the [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]] sent [[Cipher Nine|a new agent]] infiltrate Nem'ro's inner circle. Since the Hutts have taken control over gangs on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], Karrels fears that the Empire and the Republic would soon take control over the Hutts. In the guise of the pirate known as the \"[[Red Blade]]\", Jarrels was able to inform to Nem'ro that the agent has arrived. While guiding the agent to the throne room, he warns the agent that if he/she cooperates by been called up or suffer a death penalty. While sending the agent to do business in the palace, Javis continued to work on plans with security and keep an eye on his nemesis to keep him from suggesting any trouble.\n\nEventually, he was offered service by the agent in order for the Keeper to bring glory for Nem'ro. He tasked the agent to to meet with [[Odeph]] and bring back a shipment that the [[Evocii]] stole. The assignment was a success until Javis had a small conversation with Toth'lazhen about Fa'athra's mining operations and cutting down the gas supplies.\n\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nKarrels' sons had an encounter with a Sith Lord around that time, with one winding up dead and the other injured. [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]] knew that if Karrels were to find out about the encounter, he could jeopardize their entire operation by swaying Nem'ro away from an alliance with the Empire. The agent was tasked with eliminating Karrels and at the same time framing the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] for his death.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDepending on the player's choices, Javis' fate can be decided two different ways. Killing him gains dark side points. Faking his death will gain light side points.\n\nIf the player allow Javis to live, it is mentioned in a message from Keeper that Javis went to rescue his remaining son from the Sith with a gang of men. Javis was originally intended to be involved with the mission \"Finding Vengeance\" on Voss, but was cut from the mission before release.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Karrels Javis\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Javis, Karrels}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
