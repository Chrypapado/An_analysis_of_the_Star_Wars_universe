A student of the [[Almas Academy]], she received an education that varied from that taught at the [[Jedi academy|academy]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].\n\n==Biography==\nBrought into the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] at an unknown age, Agai'i was trained under the experimental curriculum of the [[Almas Academy]], which allowed older students into its ranks. Eventually passing her [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]] put forth by the [[Almas Council]] and acknowledged by the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] on Coruscant, Agai'i was elevated to the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]].<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nWell respected by her peers, Agai'i was an expert with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and notorious for her fighting courage. When the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] engulfed [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], the High Council on Coruscant issued an order to the academy's Masters, demanding that all non-essential personnel be sent to the [[Jedi Temple]] to receive assignment within the ranks of the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]]. Outraged by the High Council's decision to engage the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in all out war, Agai'i refused the rank of [[Jedi General/Legends|General]] and remained in the [[Cularin system]], performing missions solely from the Almas Council.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nGiving the Knight a hefty assignment, the Council ordered her to the abandoned [[Almas Sith fortress|fortress]] of [[Darth Rivan]] with a research team of fourteen Jedi. The fortress had been captured by the Jedi but had not been completely explored as the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] was imbued in the very stones of the structure. The Jedi were not the only ones who wanted to explore the fortress, the dark side cultists known as the [[Believers]] wished to possess the ancient knowledge within the structure for their malevolent uses. Accompanied by five of her fellow Knights, Agai'i took to protect the structure from imminent attack. Taking up a defensive position on the southern entrance to the fortress, Agai'i and the other guards waited as the research team explored the edifice.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nWhile the team was inside, a sandstorm provided cover for [[Phylus Mon]], his nine adepts, and their giant [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Wampa/Legends|Wampa]]. The ambush was successful, Agai'i and the other Jedi guarding the fortress were overwhelmed and slain, leaving the fortress and the research team vulnerable. Performing a ritual in the heart of the fortress, the adepts avoided the research team which were occupied trying to raise the academy through the storm. By the time Master [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]] organized search teams to investigate the deaths, the raiders were long gone.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agai'i, Tresten}}\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
