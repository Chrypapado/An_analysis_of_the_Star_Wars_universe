He was present for the conclusion of the war at the [[Drogheda Citadel]], when [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] attempted to take Sarna hostage. However, Harlech decided to attempt a coup, ordering his men to kill both Lando and his Queen. Before the action could take place, the revolutionaries stormed the palace, telling Harlech to stand down. Although the rest of his men had already surrendered, Harlech decided to go down fighting. However, as he brandished his blaster, he was cut down by a [[Stun/Legends|stun]] blast, depriving him of a heroic last stand.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 83|''Star Wars'' (1977) 83]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Drogheda residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
