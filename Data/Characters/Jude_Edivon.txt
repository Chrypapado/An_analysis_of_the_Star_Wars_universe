Therefore everything is science&mdash;whether you see it or not.|Ciena and Jude; Jude was known for her rational, scientific outlook|Lost Stars}}\n'''Jude Edivon''', designated '''TI803''' in the [[Imperial Navy]], was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] from [[Bespin]] who served as an [[Imperial officer|officer]] in the [[Galactic Empire]]. She attended the [[Royal Imperial Academy]] on [[Coruscant]] and shared a room with [[Ciena Ree]] and [[Kendy Idele]]. After graduating from the Academy, Edivon was stationed aboard the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|first Death Star]], where she discovered a critical weakness in the [[battle station]]'s superstructure. During the [[Battle of Yavin]], a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] [[Rebel pilot|pilot]] named [[Luke Skywalker]] exploited said flaw and destroyed the Death Star, [[Death|killing]] her and everyone else aboard the battle station.\n\n==Biography==\n===Imperial Academy===\n{{Quote|Hmmm. The paths taken by the saboteur are quite circuitous. I traced the information about Thane and&mdash;it's as if they wanted to make it look like a higher official here at the academy was responsible&hellip;Not an instructor. Someone in the Office of Student Outcomes.|Jude was known for her cool, rational and analytical mind|Lost Stars}}\n[[File:CienaJude.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jude and Ciena were invited to a ball at the Imperial Palace.]]\nA [[human]] [[Gender|female]] from the [[planet]] [[Bespin]], Jude Edivon attended the [[Royal Imperial Academy]] on [[Coruscant]], in the same class as [[Ciena Ree]], [[Thane Kyrell]], [[Nash Windrider]] and [[Kendy Idele]]. She and her roommates Ciena and Kendy quickly took a liking to each other and became close friends. During her [[time]] at the [[Imperial Academy]], she regularly went to target practice with Ciena and Kendy. On one such lesson, she praised Ciena's marksmanship.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nSix [[Standard month|months]] later, after a martial arts training session, Jude and her classmates Ciena and Kendy decided to visit the [[Museum of Multispecies Sciences]] to observe marine line. Knowing the close bond between Thane and Ciena, she advised Ciena not to become romantically involved due to the Academy's prohibition on romantic relationships among [[Imperial cadet|students]]. The following [[Standard day|day]], Jude and her fellow [[cadet]]s had their improvised [[laser cannon]]s examined by [[Commander]] [[Harn (Imperial)|Harn]]. This was part of a class project designed to test the cadets' mechanical skills and resourcefulness. When Harn examined Thane's [[laser]] [[cannon]], he found that it had been [[Saboteur|sabotaged]]. After checking the door panel, Harn determined that Ciena was the culprit.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nWhen Ciena was summoned to [[Commandant]] [[Deenlark]]'s office for disciplining, Jude sprang to her friend's defense. Using her [[Slicer|slicing]] skills, she examined the data logs and found evidence that Ciena had been framed after finding two levels of falsified data. Jude suspected that Thane was involved. Lacking strong evidence to convict or exonerate either party, Deenlark punished Ciena and Thane by failing their laser cannon assignments and downgrading their ranking in the class.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nLater, Jude found that her earlier analysis had wrongfully implicated Thane. She summoned her two friends to a network terminal and discussed her new findings, which suggested that the Academy's [[Office of Student Outcomes]] had engineered the \"laser cannon\" incident. While Thane wanted to clear his and Ciena's names and to confront the authorities, Ciena believed that this was not a battle worth fighting over and that they should instead focus on their marks. A heated argument ensued between Thane and Ciena, which ended with Thane storming out of the room after Ciena likened him to his [[Oris Kyrell|hated father]]. Jude comforted a distraught Ciena, and counselled her friend to focus on her marks and class ranking.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nTwo and a half [[Standard year|years]] later, Jude was one of four top-achieving [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] cadets, including Ciena, Thane, and [[Ved Foslo]], who were invited to a ball at the [[Imperial Palace]] on Coruscant, which had formerly been the [[Jedi temple|Jedi Temple]] during the time of the [[Galactic Republic]]. For that ball, she wore a tight-fitting [[Color|orange]] fabric and gelled her [[hair]] into short spikes. Jude also spotted [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], the junior [[senator]] of [[Alderaan]] and the adopted daughter of senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]], an outspoken critic of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. While regarding the Organas' mercy missions as misguided, Jude thought they were acting out of a spirit of kindness.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\n===Battle of Yavin===\n{{Quote|So what happened today&mdash;as many people as were lost&mdash;even more would die in a massive galactic war,''\"<br>\"''Exactly. Think of the billions who perished in the Clone Wars.|Ciena and Jude discussing the destruction of Alderaan|Lost Stars}}\n[[File:JudeReport.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jude warned her superiors about the flaw on the Death Star's exhaust port.]]\nAfter graduating from the academy, she was given the honor of serving aboard the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. When the [[battle station]] [[The Disaster|obliterated]] Alderaan with its [[superlaser]] in a show of force, many of the young Imperials on the station felt conflicted. Jude struggled to rationalize the massacre, and superficially justified the action in the belief that it would prevent [[Galactic Civil War|a much greater war]] in which countless more would [[Death|die]], though she knew this was a hollow reason.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nFollowing these events, the Death Star closed in on the [[Great Temple|secret base]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] on the [[Yavin 4|fourth]] [[moon]] of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]]. During the [[Battle of Yavin]], Jude analyzed the attack and concluded that the Rebel [[Starfighter|fighters]] posed a threat to the [[Space station|station]]. She discovered the [[Thermal exhaust port|exhaust port]] no one else suspected to be a weakness<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" /> (a deliberate act of sabotage engineered by the station's designer [[Galen Walton Erso]], who had been [[Mission to Eadu|killed]] earlier that year)<ref name=\"Rogue One\">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> and wrote to her superiors that though the chances were remote the consequences could be destructive or fatal to the station.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" /> This report eventually reached [[General]] [[Moradmin Bast]] of the [[Joint Chiefs]], who presented the information to [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the man in overall command of the battle station. Tarkin, however, rejected Edivon's conclusion and chose to remain on the station instead of ordering an evacuation. But Edivon's and Bast's fears eventually proved right. Shortly afterwards, the [[Rebel pilot]] [[Luke Skywalker]] fired a pair of [[proton torpedo]]es by using [[the Force]] into the vulnerable exhaust port, which caused a chain reaction and destroyed the station. Jude, and the remaining personnel aboard the battle station, were all killed in the ensuing explosion.<ref name=\"A New Hope\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars:'' Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Are you going to start quoting statistics again?''\"<br />\"''It's okay to be a science geek.

Kendy and I will get used to it eventually.|Edivon's roommates Kendy Idele and Ciena Ree discuss her personality|Lost Stars}}\n[[File:JudeEvidence.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jude Edivon was a skilled slicer.]]\nJude was highly adept with technology, and distinguished herself as one of the most academically skilled cadets at the academy. As a smart, calm, rational girl, she presented herself as stoic and unemotional, but she did show a more human side in private. Jude regarded science as the study of the entire material universe and took a scientific approach to every problem and situation. She was a close friend of Ciena Ree and proved to be a loyal friend on a number of occasions, and noted for her kindness and intelligence by Thane Kyrell. Despite her scientific talents, Jude was known for her humility and her willingness to admit when she was wrong.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nHer loyalty to the Empire was unwavering, which she viewed as an effective law-keeping government. The destruction of Alderaan, however, deeply impacted her, and though she was able to justify it in on the surface she clearly didn't fully believe her own rationalization. Following her death, she was long remembered by Ciena Ree, who saw her as a martyr for the Empire. Years later, Ciena thought that Jude would have been horrified to see that the Empire had built a [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]]. Even Thane Kyrell, who had defected to the Alliance, remembered her fondly and felt saddened by her death, because of which he could never bring himself to speak with Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\nShe was described as pale, tall, and willowy.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nJude was a skilled slicer who understood how [[computer]] systems and networks operated.
