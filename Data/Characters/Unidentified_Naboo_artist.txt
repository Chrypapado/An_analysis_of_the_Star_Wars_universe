In his studio at the base of an [[Abandoned Naboo castle|abandoned castle]] just outside the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Theed/Legends|Theed]], the [[Artist/Legends|artist]] repeatedly painted images of nothing but [[Star/Legends|suns]] and [[Moon/Legends|moons]]. While visiting a bazaar in the city during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the artist exchanged brief glances with the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] [[Senator/Legends|senator]], [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. Following the encounter, the artist was consumed by visions of Amidala and her unborn twin children. For twenty-four weeks afterward, the artist painted nothing but pictures of the senator, in the hope that he would be able to understand his visions. He eventually reached an epiphany and raced back to Theed, where he saved Amidala's life during an [[Invasion of Theed (Clone Wars)|invasion]] of the city by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. After the incident, the artist became intrigued by the planet [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:ArtistPainting.png|thumb|left|190px|The artist tried to discover the root of his visions through painting.]]\nIn the final years of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]], a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] lived as an [[Artist/Legends|artist]] on the [[Mid Rim]]<ref name=\"TEA\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. This artist was a recluse and resided in his studio at the base of an [[Abandoned Naboo castle|abandoned castle]] located just north of Naboo's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Theed/Legends|Theed]]. His mind was constantly occupied by images of [[Star/Legends|suns]] and [[Moon/Legends|moons]], and as a result he painted nothing but those celestial bodies. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], the artist traveled to a popular bazaar on the outskirts of Theed.<ref name=\"TAoN\" />\n\nCoincidentally, the [[Senator/Legends|senator]] of Naboo, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], was also visiting the bazaar that day. While perusing the marketplace, the artist happened to exchange a glance with Amidala before she continued to shop. The encounter had a profound effect on him. Instead of experiencing images of suns and moons, the artist was consumed by visions of Amidala and her unborn twins. He lost all perception of the world around him, only able to see the senator and her children in his mind's eye. The artist was barely able to depart the bazaar and return to his studio, where he contemplated the meaning of the images. In an attempt to decipher what message they held, the artist painted for twenty-four consecutive weeks. The walls of his studio became so cluttered with his paintings of Amidala that many were relegated to simply resting on the floor.<ref name=\"TAoN\" />\n\nThe artist eventually reached an epiphany. In his visions, he had foreseen that the senator would be in danger, so he raced back to Theed to save her. The artist arrived in the city during a Confederate [[Invasion of Theed (Clone Wars)|invasion]] and was forced to search the abandoned streets for his muse. The artist found her attempting to flee a force of [[B1-Series battle droid]]s and [[OG-9 homing spider droid/Legends|OG-9 homing spider droids]]; however, before he could reach her, the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] opened fire. To save the senator's life, the man stepped in front of the [[Laser/Legends|laser]] fire and was gunned down. He survived the incident and later recovered, but he continued to paint based on his foreboding visions. His next inspiration was the peaceful [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]].<ref name=\"TAoN\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:PadmeBazaar-AoN.png|thumb|right|210px|Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the artist's muse]]\nThe Naboo artist was a reclusive man who spent much of his time alone in his abandoned castle-turned-studio. Although he was first obsessed with the idea of painting suns and moons, his encounter with Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala had a profound impact on him. He became fixated by the thought of her and her as-of-yet unborn children, much to his confusion. His drive to uncover the meaning behind the visions pushed him into twenty-four straight weeks of painting, followed by a heavy personal sacrifice in the name of saving his muse.<ref name=\"TAoN\" />\n\nThis man's premonitions of Amidala's eminent danger were similar to [[Force vision/Legends|those]] granted by [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. As a result of these premonitions,<ref name=\"TAoN\" /> Amidala survived to give birth to her twin children, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]].<ref name=\"RotS\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe artist's first and only appearance was in the short [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] entitled ''[[The Artist of Naboo]]''. The comic was written and illustrated by [[Erik Tiemens]], a concept artist who worked on [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. ''The Artist of Naboo'' was included in the trade paperback comic book ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'',<ref name=\"TAoN\" /> published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] on [[March 16]], [[2005]].<ref name=\"DarkHorse: Visionaries\">{{DarkHorse|Books/10-463/Star-Wars-Visionaries-TPB|STAR WARS: VISIONARIES TPB|archivedate=20200628051401}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Artist of Naboo|book=Star Wars: Visionaries}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|82|Drawn By The Force}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWArchive|url=eu/lit/comics/news20050315.html|text=Inside ''Star Wars: Visionaries''|archivedate=20100328092801}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0441 \u041d\u0430\u0431\u0443\n}}\n\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Humanoids]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
