Given the fact that she had always been an excellent student who possessed the ability to learn and retain information easily, the prospect of her entering the Academy and graduating at the top of her class was very realistic.\n\nHowever, she became disillusioned with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] when one of her close friends at the [[Imperial Institute of Higher Studies]] on [[Ferrhast]], [[Celida Noerr]] joined the Rebel Alliance, revealing the brutal truth about the Empire by breaking into the Institute's computer banks. As a result of the break-in, Celinda Noerr was arrested as a traitor and never seen or heard from again.\n\nShandira joined the Alliance and worked as an operative, drawing largely upon her skills with handling of information. When the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] was formed, she continued to serve in the same capacity.\n\n===Encounter on Venaari===\nL'hnnar travelled to [[Venaari]] to meet up with a local cell of rebels. She was at the [[Binary Bar]] when some of the [[Venaarian]] rebels were attacked by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. [[Sienn Sconn]], who was also in the bar, attacked the Imperials and tried to help her escape. Becoming trapped in the back of the bar, L'hnnar saw a stockroom that was storing [[Gravdinian Ale]] and realized the room would have to have vents to the outside to allow the dangerous vapors from the [[Alcohol/Legends|alcohol]] to be dispersed. Using Sconn's [[stun-staff]], she found the ventilation shaft and the pair climbed out to the roof. Sconn jumped down to the alley to take out a crew of a [[SV-50 Swift-Strike Speeder|Venaarian Strike Speeder]] and was saved when L'hnnar shot the co-pilot who had snuck up behind the thief. The pair took the speeder and headed toward [[Ven-Kavi Starport]] so that L'hnnar could get back to her [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|ship]] and escape the planet. During the trip, L'hnnar attempted to drop off Sconn so he wouldn't get involved in the New Republic business, but he told her that he promised to see her safely to her ship. After resuming their journey, L'hnnar heard the sound of a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named [[Pentix Graphyt]] landing on the roof of their speeder. She lent Sconn her hold-out blaster so he could investigate. After Sconn managed to defeat the bounty hunter, L'hnnar made it to [[docking bay 18]] and offered to take Sconn off-planet with her. He refused to join the New Republic and stayed behind to cover her escape. Before she left, she kissed Sconn and slipped a [[Credit chip/Legends|credit stick]] with 25,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] on it into his pocket.<ref name=\"AJ5\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|5|One of a Kind (short story)|One of a Kind}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|9|Easy Credits}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|15|Two for One}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:L'hnar, Shandria}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
