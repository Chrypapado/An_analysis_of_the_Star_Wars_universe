In a position to select the [[Kuat sector/Legends|Kuat sector's]] representative in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], Onara ensured that both her family and her [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyards]] would benefit from her selections. [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Risi Lenoan]] acquitted herself well in that regard, but when questions arose concerning her bookkeeping in conjunction with Kuat Drive Yards, she was forced to leave her office. In selecting Lenoan's successor, Onara attempted to choose someone who would be [[Politics/Legends|politically]] malleable. Her choice, [[Giddean Danu/Legends|Giddean Danu]], proved to be anything but, as he opposed the centralization of power and championed the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]].\n\nRealizing her mistake, Onara unsuccessfully tried to have Danu recalled. Her nephew, [[Kuat (person)|Kuat of Kuat]], along with several others, thought that Danu was a strong advocate of Kuati independence, and so the man stayed. Furthermore, he began investigating the Kuat family as part of his planned reform of Kuati politics. Concerned that her closely guarded secrets would be revealed, Onara began pursuing other methods of removing Danu. At a performance of [[Squid Lake/Legends|''Squid Lake'']] at the [[Galaxies Opera House/Legends|Galaxies Opera House]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], shortly before the conclusion of the Clone Wars, she met with [[Tannon Praji]]'s bodyguard, [[Ottegru Grey]]. Grey assured her that all her problems would be solved if she was to stay loyal to [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Onara was eventually succeeded by her nephew's [[Kuat's father|father]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Lenoan to Danu===\nIn the waning years of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Onara Kuat was the principal [[Director/Legends|director]] of [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]], a [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyard]] that had been supplying the government with [[Warship/Legends|warships]] for thousands of years. Onara herself was a distant descendant of a [[House Kuat|family]] that had been one of the original [[Core Founder/Legends|Core Founders]]. By the time of Onara's ascension to the role of principal director of [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]] Drive Yards and head of the Kuat family, her office had the power to select the [[Kuat sector/Legends|Kuat sector's]] representative in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. Onara always made sure that her choices would benefit the shipyards and her family as well.<ref name=\"db\" /> In [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Onara received a [[Project Icefang|secret order]] for KDY worth billions of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], to produce [[Starship/Legends|starships]], vehicles and equipment for a [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|clone army]] that was being developed in secret on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]].<ref name=\"Warfare\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref>\n\n[[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Risi Lenoan]] served Kuat well in her tenure, but was removed from office when questions arose concerning her bookkeeping in connection with Kuat Drive Yards funds. For Lenoan's successor, Onara chose a man she thought would be easily manipulated: [[Giddean Danu/Legends|Giddean Danu]]. The choice proved unwise for the principal director,<ref name=\"db\" /> as Danu was a vocal supporter of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]],<ref name=\"dbgd\">{{DB|character|giddeandanu|Danu, Giddean|archivedate=20100203113012}}</ref> and spoke out against the centralization of power. When the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] broke out in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Danu advocated the role of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] as overseers of the conflict.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===Trouble===\nDispleased, Onara attempted to have him removed, but other members of her family, including her nephew, [[Kuat (person)|Kuat of Kuat]], believed Danu to be an effective representative and advocate of Kuati independence. Onara's motion failed as a result, and making matters worse for her, Danu intended to launch a reformation of Kuati [[Politics/Legends|politics]]. To start with, he intended to investigate the Kuat family. This deeply concerned Onara, and she feared that certain secrets pertaining to her would be brought to light.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n[[File:Opera_box.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Kuat with others at a performance of ''Squid Lake''.]]\nHoping to take control of the situation, Onara began pursuing other ways of having Danu removed. Shortly after the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|Battle of Coruscant]], she attended a performance of [[Squid Lake/Legends|''Squid Lake'']] at the [[Galaxies Opera House/Legends|Galaxies Opera House]]<ref name=\"db\" />&mdash;a performance also attended by [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Seated in Galaxies owner [[Romeo Treblanc]]'s [[Romeo Treblanc's private viewing box|private box]] along with several other dignitaries and Treblanc himself,<ref name=\"rots\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref><ref name=\"dbrt\">{{DB|character|romeotreblanc|Treblanc, Romeo|archivedate=20100428044213}}</ref> she discussed her situation with [[Tannon Praji]],<ref name=\"db\" /> [[First Minister (Coruscant Ministry of Ingress)|First Minister]] of the [[Coruscant Ministry of Ingress/Legends|Coruscant Ministry of Ingress]].<ref name=\"dbtp\">{{DB|character|tannonpraji|Praji, Tannon|archivedate=20100325204904}}</ref> Praji, sympathetic, introduced her to his bodyguard, [[Ottegru Grey]].<ref name=\"db\" /> Grey, who was actually an agent of Chancellor Palpatine's,<ref name=\"dbog\">{{DB|character|ottegrugrey|Grey, Ottegru|archivedate=20101116014529}}</ref> assured Onara that the problem with Danu would be resolved. Although he did not elaborate, he told the principal director that loyalty to Palpatine was all that was required of her.<ref name=\"db\" /> In time, Onara was succeeded by the [[Kuat's father|father]] of her nephew, who was in turn followed by the younger Kuat of Kuat himself.<ref name=\"tma\">''[[The Mandalorian Armor]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDuring her tenure, Onara was seen as a prime example of the cutthroat and labyrinth nature of Kuati politics, as well as the consolidation of aristocrat, politician, and business executive. Onara tried to make sure that her choices for the role of the Kuat [[Sector/Legends|sector's]] senator always benefited her family and her work, although her choices of Lenoan and Danu both proved to be problematic. Onara did not tolerate Danu's views on political influence and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], leading her to the knee-jerk reaction of trying to have him removed. When that did not work, she found herself worrying about his investigation of her family, which could have dug up secrets about her operations.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|First things first: ''Why Kuat?'' Well&hellip;why not. To elaborate further: The hat.|[[Aidan Hennessy]]|url=http://blogs.starwars.com/QuentinGeorge/1}}\nThe character of Onara Kuat first appeared as an unnamed extra in the \"Galaxies Opera House\" sequence of [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. She was played by visual effects executive producer [[Denise Ream]], and is seen in one of the boxes at the Opera House. Accompanying Ream, cameos were also made by visual effects supervisor [[John Knoll]] as Tannon Praji, animation director [[Rob Coleman]] as Romeo Treblanc, visual effects supervisor [[Roger Guyett]] as Ottegru Grey, and visual effects producer [[Jill Brooks]] as [[Gem Sirrom/Legends|Gem Sirrom]].\n\nIn [[2006]], the character of Kuat was named and fleshed out by [[Aidan Hennessy]], through the [[StarWars.com]] [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature, \"[[What's The Story?]]\" Noting that the character wore elaborate headgear similar to characters from Kuat, such as Giddean Danu, Risi Lenoan, and Kuat of Kuat, he decided to connect Ream's character with the planet. Since he felt the time period had been underused in the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]], Hennessy loosely tied Kuat's entry to the [[New Sith Wars]] that had originated in [[Terry Brooks]]' [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' novelization]].<ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|QuentinGeorge|1|Onara Kuat - Behind the Scenes|Do Nautolans Dream of Aquatic Sheep?|Aidan Hennessy|archivedate=20061115052810}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, he utilized the characters of Risi Lenoan from the [[HoloNet News (original website)|HoloNet News]] website, and Giddean Danu from ''Revenge of the Sith'', meshing them with the story of Kuat. Some minor details that he had written about the characters were cut, concerning Danu's origins and fate, as well as Lenoan's embezzlement of funds. Kuat of Kuat originated in [[K. W. Jeter]]'s ''[[Bounty Hunter Wars]]'' trilogy, who had been used sparingly in the Expanded Universe outside his original appearances in those books. As a further tie, he wrote Ottegru Grey, who had also been fleshed out through \"What's the Story?\" into his entry.<ref name=\"blog\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{DB|character|onarakuat|Kuat, Onara|archivedate=20100209160513}} {{1stID|Onara Kuat}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=Head of the [[House Kuat|Kuat family]] and Director of [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]]<ref name=\"db\" />\n|years=c.
