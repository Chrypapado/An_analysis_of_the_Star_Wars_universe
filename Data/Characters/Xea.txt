In the early [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Imperial Era|reign]], she and her older [[TK-462|brother]] lived with their [[TK-462's father|father]] and [[TK-462's mother|mother]], who maintained an [[air scrubber]] [[Scrubber farm|farm]]. Shortly after Xea turned eight, a band of rebels raided the farm and attempted to steal scrubbers by tugging them with a [[starship]]. One of the machines, however, fell on the roof and into the room where Xea slept, crushing the eight-year-old to [[death]]. Because of that tragic incident, Xea's brother developed a deep hatred for rebels, which prompted him to enlist in the [[Imperial Academy]] to become a [[stormtrooper]].<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|166|TK-462 (short story)|TK-462}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
