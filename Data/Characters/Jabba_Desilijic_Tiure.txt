Jabba was a major figure on Tatooine, where he controlled the bulk of the [[Pirate|piracy]], [[slavery]], and trafficking in illegal goods that generated most of the planet's wealth. He was also highly influential in the entire Outer Rim as one of its most powerful crime lords.\n\nDuring the [[Clone Wars]], Jabba's influence and power over the Outer Rim, specifically its [[Hyperspace route|hyperlanes]], was sought by both the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], who both courted Jabba's approval. When [[Rotta]], Jabba's son, was kidnapped, the crime lord promised his support to whoever returned his son. When the Separatists were revealed to have orchestrated Rotta's kidnapping, Jabba pledged his support to the Republic.\n\nJabba continued to operate in the Outer Rim after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the [[Galactic Empire]], preserving his power base, despite the interference of [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Galactic Emperor]]. After the [[Battle of Yavin|destruction]] of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], the Emperor sent [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to [[Assault on Cymoon#Aftermath|negotiate]] a deal with Jabba to secure raw materials for [[Imperial Military|Imperial military]] production. Jabba's alliance with the Empire allowed him and the Hutts to survive the Imperial crackdown against criminal elements in the Outer Rim, as well as rid the Hutt of his competitors.\n\nAfter the smuggler [[Han Solo]] failed to repay him for lost cargo, Jabba placed a high price on his head. Solo was eventually delivered to him by one of his [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Boba Fett]], as a gift from Darth Vader. However, this capture brought him to the attention of [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]], who sought to rescue his friend from Jabba's imprisonment. As he attempted to execute the Jedi and his allies in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], Jabba was choked to [[death]] by [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]. With the Hutts unable to decide who would inherit Jabba's criminal ventures, many of his slaves, including the [[Nikto]]s, were free, and his palace was abandoned after the [[droid]] pool was deactivated.\n\n==Biography==\n===Tatooine crime lord===\n[[File:Jabba_Boonta_Eve.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jabba hosts the Boonta Eve Classic podrace in [[32 BBY]]]]\nJabba Desilijic Tiure<ref name=\"AEYNTK\" /> was a [[Hutt]] who hailed from [[Nal Hutta]].<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" /> He was born in [[600 BBY]].<ref name=\"AEYNTK\" /> He was the grandson of [[Mama]] and [[Papa]]<ref name=\"Super Graphic\">''[[Star Wars Super Graphic: A Visual Guide to a Galaxy Far, Far Away]]''</ref> the Hutts,<ref name=\"HFZ\">{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}}</ref> and the nephew of [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] and [[Ebor]], as they were the siblings of his [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's father|father]].<ref name=\"Super Graphic\" /> His [[Parent|mother]] left enough of a mark on him that, years later, he would force the [[Askajian]] dancer [[Yarna d'al' Gargan]] to wear special makeup to make her look more like his genitrix.<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> He also had a cousin named [[Crakka]]<ref name=\"RTVC 4\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle 4|''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle'' 4]]</ref> and a nephew named [[Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo|Gorga]].<ref name=\"Super Graphic\" />\n\nSeveral [[Standard century|centuries]] before the [[Galactic Civil War]], he became the reigning [[crime lord]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]], owning several criminal enterprises which included smuggling, glitterstim [[spice]] dealing, [[Slavery|slave]] trading, assassination and [[Pirate|piracy]].<ref name=\"RotJ junior novel\">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]</ref> At some point, Jabba became affiliated with the [[Crymorah syndicate]].

His operations grew to include slavery, arms dealing, spice smuggling, and gambling. Gambling was a prominent feature of the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena]], where Jabba built grandstands from which he could control the gambling and concessions during [[Podracing|podraces]].<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> To those who respected his authority, he was formally styled as \"His Excellency Jabba Desilijic Tiure of Nal Hutta, Eminence of Tatooine.\"<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" />\n\nShortly after the start of the [[Invasion of Naboo]], Jabba presided over the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] podrace, where his entrance in the stands was greeted with cheers from the spectators who came to watch the race from all corners of the Outer Rim Territories.

A treaty is in order.|Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and TC-70, the latter of whom spoke for Jabba|audio=HuttTreaty-TCWf.ogg|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}\nTen years after the Naboo Crisis,<ref name=\"Episode II\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> the galaxy was plunged into the chaos of the [[Clone Wars]], a massive galactic conflict between the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and the [[Separatist Droid Army|droid armies]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Shortly after the [[First Battle of Geonosis|outbreak]] of the war, Jabba's infant son, [[Rotta]], was kidnapped. Though Jabba did not know who the kidnapper was, it was carried out by his uncle, Ziro, and the Separatist Alliance, both of whom had their own schemes at play. Jabba requested the assistance of anyone who could help, and the Republic and the [[Jedi Order]] answered the call. It was the hope of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] that the Republic would be able to negotiate an alliance with Jabba for use of Hutt [[hyperspace]] lanes in the Outer Rim, as the Separatists controlled the major lanes.<ref name=\"TCW-film\" />\n\n[[File:Jabba_confers.png|thumb|right|300px|Jabba confers with Chancellor Palpatine]]\nThe Jedi sent [[Jedi General|General]] Anakin Skywalker, who had become a [[Jedi Knight]] in the years since his victory in the Boonta Eve Classic, and his [[Padawan]], [[Ahsoka Tano]], to the [[Teth system]] to find Rotta. Meanwhile, General [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] traveled to Tatooine to personally negotiate a treaty with Jabba. While the [[Jedi Master]] was en route, Jabba was presented with the heads of [[bounty hunter]]s he had sent to Teth to find his son. Infuriated by the lack of progress, Jabba contacted Chancellor Palpatine and, through his translator droid, [[TC-70]], demanded to know why the Jedi were not searching for his son. The chancellor assured the crime lord that the Jedi were on their way, of which Jabba said the treaty with him depended on.<ref name=\"TCW-film\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']]</ref>\n\nKenobi soon arrived at Jabba's Palace and was taken before the Hutt's court. Kenobi told Jabba that Skywalker, who he described as one of the Order's most powerful Jedi, was on his way to Teth to rescue Rotta and that the Jedi would not let the Hutt down. Jabba attached one additional condition to the proposed treaty&mdash;that the Jedi deliver him the kidnapper as well, dead or alive. Jabba also leveled a threat against the Jedi: if they did not succeed, the Separatist leader [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and the Separatist Droid Army would&mdash;still not knowing that Dooku himself was behind the kidnapping, in a plot to turn the Hutt Clan into an enemy of the Republic. Kenobi departed the palace, which was followed by the arrival of Count Dooku himself. The [[Sith Lord]] claimed that it was the Jedi who kidnapped Rotta and that the Jedi were plotting to destroy Jabba. Jabba demanded proof, which Dooku delivered in the form of a manipulated [[Hologram|holographic]] recording allegedly showing Skywalker and Tano, who had found Rotta on Teth, harming the child, when in reality they were caring for it after he had fallen ill. Dooku told the crime lord that the Separatist Droid Army was initiating a rescue mission and would soon deliver the Huttlet to his father. All Dooku asked in return was that Jabba join the Separatist cause.<ref name=\"TCW-film\" />\n\nDooku's [[Sith]] acolyte, [[Asajj Ventress]], contacted the count, who played her message in front of Jabba and his court. Ventress claimed that Skywalker killed Rotta and was on his way to Tatooine. Jabba questioned why the Jedi would come to Tatooine, to which Dooku said that the Jedi plot had become clear and that Skywalker would soon arrive to kill the crime lord and wipe out the entire Hutt Clan. Dooku promised Jabba that he would personally deal with Skywalker and, despite fighting the Jedi Knight in a lightsaber duel in the desert, Skywalker managed to reach Jabba's Palace. Once there, Skywalker found that Tano, who had Rotta and from whom he had become separated, had not yet reached the palace. Jabba's henchmen drew their weapons on Skywalker, so the Jedi Knight drew [[Skywalker lightsaber|his lightsaber]] and pointed it at Jabba&mdash;seemingly confirming Dooku's claims. Jabba said that this was proof that Skywalker had arrived to kill him, but the Jedi said he had only come to negotiate. Just as Jabba's henchmen prepared to kill Skywalker, Tano arrived and delivered Rotta to his father.<ref name=\"TCW-film\" />\n\n[[File:Padme_talks_to_Jabba.png|thumb|left|300px|Jabba learns the truth from Senator Amidala]]\nDespite the happy reunion with his son, Jabba ordered Skywalker and Tano's execution due to believing they kindapped the kid. They were saved, however, by a message from [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo]], who had discovered Ziro's involvement in the plot. Ziro entered the holographic transmission and admitted to conspiring with Dooku to kidnap Rotta and frame the Jedi, so Jabba told the senator that the Hutt Clan would severely punish Ziro. Amidala asked him if the hostilities between Jabba and the Jedi could cease and if he would open his hyperspace lanes to the Republic, to which Jabba agreed. The two sides signed a treaty allowing the Grand Army of the Republic through Jabba's territories, a decision Amidala assured him he would not regret. [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] and clone forces soon arrived at Jabba's Palace, signaling a new era of cooperation between the Republic and Jabba the Hutt.<ref name=\"TCW-film\" />\n\n====Eliminating Ziro====\n{{Quote|Jabba thanks you for delivering the holo-diary.|TC-70, to Sy Snootles|Hunt for Ziro}}\nLater in the war, Jabba was visited by [[Baron]] [[Notluwiski Papanoida]], the [[chairman]] of the moon [[Pantora]], whose daughters, [[Che Amanwe Papanoida]] and [[Chi Eekway Papanoida]], had been kidnapped by [[Greedo]], a bounty hunter in Jabba's employ. The chairman was able to reason with the Hutt crime lord, who, like Papanoida, knew all too well what it was like to have his child taken from him. Greedo insisted that he was not responsible, but Jabba allowed a blood sample to be taken from his bounty hunter so it could be compared to blood found at the scene of the crime. Greedo admitted to kidnapping the chairman's daughters at the behest of the Separatists, who wanted leverage against the Pantorans, and Papanoida was soon reunited with his children.<ref name=\"Sphere of Influence\">{{TCW|Sphere of Influence}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, the Grand Hutt Council became concerned that Ziro, who was in Galactic Republic custody, was planning on turning over incriminating evidence about the council's illicit activity, as the imprisoned Hutt had a [[Hutt Council records|journal]] secretly hidden on Teth that contained the evidence. Jabba hired bounty hunter [[Cad Bane]] to free Ziro from prison,<ref name=\"Evil Plans\" /> so he could be imprisoned by the Hutt Clan instead.<ref name=\"HFZ\" /> Bane took members of the [[Galactic Senate]] [[Senate hostage crisis|hostage]] inside the [[Galactic Senate Building|Senate Building]], offering their safety in return for Ziro's freedom. Chancellor Palpatine refused the demands, but Palpatine soon changed his mind and allowed Ziro to be freed.<ref name=\"Hostage Crisis\">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref> Bane brought Ziro to the Grand Hutt Council on Nal Hutta, where Ziro was imprisoned once more, though Jabba himself was not present. [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder]] instead acted as a representative.<ref name=\"HFZ\" />\n\n[[File:Jabba_receives_the_records.png|thumb|right|300px|Sy Snootles hands Ziro's records over to Jabba]]\nJabba instead planned Ziro's elimination. He hired Ziro's old girlfriend, the singer [[Sy Snootles]], to find the records and eliminate Ziro. Snootles freed Ziro from his imprisonment and tricked him into believing that she was on his side, so he brought her to Teth where he planned to recover his records. Once there, however, Snootles killed the crime lord and brought the records to Jabba, who expressed his gratitude for her work.<ref name=\"HFZ\" />\n\n====Forced into the Shadow Collective====\n{{Quote|The mighty Jabba and the Hutt families have decided to join you.|[[Unidentified GL vendor droid (Tatooine)|Jabba's GL vendor droid]]|Eminence (episode)}}\nJabba Desilijic Tiure later found himself roped into the schemes of [[Maul]], a renegade Sith Lord who hoped to regain the status he lost after his defeat during the [[Battle of Naboo]] over a decade earlier. As part of his plan, Maul formed the [[Shadow Collective]], an alliance between the Mandalorian faction [[Death Watch]] and various elements from the criminal underworld, including [[Black Sun]] and the [[Pyke Syndicate]]. Their goal was to [[Takeover of Mandalore|take over]] the planet [[Mandalore]]. Despite their combined might, the Shadow Collective still required additional resources, including muscle and supplies, to achieve their goal. To find these resources, they went before the Grand Hutt Council to negotiate an alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Shadow Collective. Maul, his brother [[Savage Opress]], and Death Watch leader [[Pre Vizsla]] met with the Hutt leaders, where Maul negotiated the terms and conditions of the alliance with Jabba himself. The Hutts wanted to know what they could offer and how much their assistance was worth. Maul proposed an exchange: in return for [[Hutt Space]] and everything in its borders, he would spare their lives. Jabba and the Council were dismissive of Maul's threats, which resulted in a skirmish between the Shadow Collective and the Grand Hutt Council's forces. Maul, Opress, and Vizsla fought off various enforcers and bounty hunters, until their Death Watch reinforcements arrived. With the additional troops, Maul, Vizsla and Opress were able to rout the enemy forces and secure a victory.<ref name=\"Eminence\" />\n\n[[File:Jabba_joins_the_Shadow_Collective.png|thumb|left|300px|Jabba is forced into joining the Shadow Collective, though the alliance would not last for long]]\nAlthough the Collective was triumphant, the ensuing conflict and chaos allowed all but one Hutt to escape&mdash;[[Oruba]]. Maul interrogated Oruba, threatening to kill him unless he revealed where the others had escaped to. Under duress, Oruba informed Maul that he could find Jabba in his palace on Tatooine. The Shadow Collective soon arrived, facing little resistance as they made their way into Jabba's court. Maul ordered Jabba and the council to submit to his demands and join the Shadow Collective, lest they suffer his wrath. With little choice in the matter, Jabba agreed to assist the Shadow Collective in its takeover of Mandalore.<ref name=\"Eminence\" /> The resources the Hutt Clan provided aided the Shadow Collective in its successful takeover of Mandalore, with Maul declaring himself the new leader of Mandalore.<ref name=\"Shades of Reason\">{{TCW|Shades of Reason}}</ref> However, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious&mdash;secretly Chancellor Palpatine himself<ref name=\"Episode III\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>&mdash;came to regard Maul as a threat and targeted the Shadow Collective.<ref name=\"The Lawless\">{{TCW|The Lawless}}</ref> The group fractured under assault by the Sith and their Separatist puppets, and Maul's plan was resoundingly defeated by Darth Sidious.<ref name=\"Son of Dathomir 4\">[[Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 4|''Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir'' 4]]</ref>\n\n===Age of the Empire===\n====Crime amid fascism====\n{{Quote|Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.|Han Solo, after Jabba extended the time he had to repay his debts|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n[[File:HanJabbaDockingBay94.png|thumb|right|300px|Jabba and Solo discuss the smuggler's debt in Mos Eisley.]]\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] into the [[Galactic Empire]], and the chancellor declared himself [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]].<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Jabba continued his illicit operations during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], continuing to hold influence as a crime lord.<ref name=\"SW15\">[[Star Wars (2015) 15|''Star Wars'' (2015) 15]]</ref> Around one year into the Empire's reign, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano decided against going to Jabba for help while avoiding the [[Imperial Military]], deciding the Hutt would not help her<ref name=\"Ahsoka\">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref> despite her role in saving his son during the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"TCW-film\" />\n\nDuring a particularly bad [[Great Drought|drought]] on Tatooine, Jabba began collecting a hefty [[water tax]] from local [[moisture farmer]]s. This earned his thugs an unpleasant encounter with Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was watching and protecting a young [[Luke Skywalker]]. When Skywalker attempted to steal the thugs' collections for the day, they caught and threatened to kill him. It was at that moment that Kenobi took down the thugs with [[the Force]]. Under cover of darkness, the gangsters were unable to identify Kenobi. Most displeased with his loss of tax revenue, Jabba hired the [[Wookiee]] bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]] to track down and identify the former Jedi Master.<ref name=\"SW15\" />\n\nStreet orphan and later [[Spectres|rebel]] Jedi [[Ezra Bridger]] identified himself as \"Jabba\" whenever he wanted to keep his real name secret, for example to Imperial officers.<ref name=\"spark\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref><ref name=\"stealth\">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref><ref name=\"twilight\">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>\n\nIn [[10 BBY]], the scoundrel [[Tobias Beckett]] came into contact with Jabba and intended to travel to Tatooine to work for him once he decided to leave [[Crimson Dawn]], but he was killed by [[Han Solo]] at [[Savareen]] before that could come to be.<ref name=\"Solo\">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> As such, Jabba hired Solo for his operations, who became the best smuggler on Jabba's payroll.<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> Solo's standing was jeopardized, however, when his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', was boarded by Imperial authorities, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo. Jabba demanded compensation for the lost cargo and, when Solo could not pay, the crime lord sent bounty hunters after him. One such hunter was Greedo, who confronted Solo in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina|a cantina]] in [[Mos Eisley]], but Solo killed the [[Rodian]] bounty hunter before he could kill Solo. Jabba learned of this and found Solo in [[Docking Bay 94]], where the smuggler said that he had no choice but to dump his cargo. Jabba agreed to give Solo an extension on the payment in exchange for<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> fifteen percent interest.<ref name=\"AEYNTK\" /> Solo accepted the offer, but he soon became involved in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and once again failed to pay Jabba.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> When Jabba learned that Solo had joined the Rebellion, Jabba placed a large bounty on the smuggler's head.<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" />\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], in which the Alliance&mdash;with Solo's help&mdash;destroyed the Imperial, planet-destroying [[battle station]] known as the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]],<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> the Empire was left in dire need of additional military resources. To increase its supply of weapons, the Empire planned to negotiate with an envoy in Jabba's employ on [[Cymoon 1]], in the [[Corellian Industrial Cluster]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\">[[Star Wars (2015) 1|''Star Wars'' (2015) 1]]</ref> The Sith Lord Darth Vader&mdash;formerly Anakin Skywalker<ref name=\"Episode III\" />&mdash;was tasked as the Imperial negotiator, with the intent of forcing Jabba's envoy in a deal favorable to the Empire. The envoy's vessel was hijacked by the Rebel Alliance, however, and a team of Rebels, including Solo, used it to [[Assault on Cymoon|assault]]<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" /> and destroy [[Weapons Factory Alpha]] on Cymoon 1, leveling another critical defeat against the Empire.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Vader_in_Jabbas_palace.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Darth Vader arrives in Jabba's court.]]\nThe Emperor ordered Vader to travel to Tatooine and negotiate with Jabba personally. The Sith Lord arrived a day ahead of schedule, using his early arrival to carry out a personal mission in Jabba's Palace. Vader told Jabba that he would return on official Imperial business the next day, but, for that moment, he wanted to discuss his own mission. Jabba believed that Vader would attempt to use a [[mind trick]] to force him into doing the Dark Lord's will, but Vader said he would not, as mind tricks were not the way of the Sith. Jabba briefly considered collecting the bounty that the Rebel Alliance placed on Vader's head and throwing him into a [[rancor]] pit beneath his court, but he opted not to once he realized Vader was aware of the trap. Jabba continued his discussions with Vader and incorrectly referred to the Sith Lord as a Jedi, resulting in Vader igniting [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|his lightsaber]] and becoming a target of Jabba's henchmen. The Dark Lord wiped many of the guards out before using the Force to [[Force choke|choke]] Jabba, an attack that left the crime lord more amenable to Vader's demands. With Jabba ready to comply, Vader explained that he needed two of Jabba's best bounty hunters to work on a personal mission. Jabba agreed to the demands and provided him with [[Boba Fett]] and Black Krrsantan.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" />\n\nAs promised, Vader returned to Jabba's court the next day to continue the official negotiations on behalf of the Empire. The negotiations concluded with Jabba agreeing to provide the Imperial war machine with whatever resources it required. Jabba requested only that the Emperor pay him well, to which Vader said that the Empire would pay him whatever they felt was appropriate. Additionally, as long as Jabba complied with Imperial demands, the Empire would allow Jabba to continue operating his criminal empire. Jabba convinced Vader to briefly stay on Tatooine for a feast and entertainment in the Sith Lord's honor, and the entertainment proved to be the hunting of wild [[bantha]]. Jabba hosted the Sith Lord on his [[sail barge]], where Jabba inquired as to whether the two bounty hunters had proven themselves useful thus far. Vader stated that their missions would be simple enough: capture an [[Cylo|Imperial agent]] working for the Emperor, and locate the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. Vader also demanded to know everything that Jabba knew about Obi-Wan Kenobi, who lived in [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on Tatooine for nearly two decades. Jabba told him only that Kenobi had proven to be a thorn in his side in those years.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\n====The thirteen crates====\n{{Quote|The great Jabba thinks perhaps you know this, because ''you'' are the one who stole it.

Jabba initially told them that he did not deal with such weapons, as this was prohibited by Imperial law. When Starros asked him about the twelve crates, Jabba said that perhaps Starros herself could be the thief, and referred to her relationship with Han Solo. Starros said that she had no relationship with Solo and then demanded 20,000 credits for the names of the thieves, who, according to her, were the Krawg pirates. At the same moment, a Krawg pirate appeared behind them and accused them of lying, but was shot dead by Starros. He carried one of the blasters, so Jabba believed and paid her.

There they saw several [[Tusken Raider]]s, who demanded that Jabba should prevent [[Jawa]]s and Imperials from continuing to enter their dunes. However, Jabba did not care about their problems, made fun of them and eventually threatened them indirectly, but finally assured them that he would take care of the matter. When Cantonica's two traders put forth their requests, Jabba presented them a purchase, but refused to give it to them, emphasizing that this was the only quantity of desert wine on Tatooine and they should not come up with the idea of stealing the Tuskens' property during one of their night prayer at highmoon at the Great Dune, because then they would [[Death|die]]. However, in a bar in Mos Eisley the traders decided to steal the desert wine, especially since the price had risen. They were overheard by a Jawa, who went immediately to his people to tell them about the expensive wine. However, they were watched by an Imperial droid, who in turn informed an Imperial [[captain]] about the wine. During the night, the two traders went to the Great Dune, where they discovered that there were no Tusksens. Soon after, a few Jawas with battle droids appeared as well as Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s with their captain. They all demanded that each other lower their weapons. Before shots were fired, the Rodian tried to convince all parties that there desert wine and someone had planned for them to be there. At that moment, the Imperial captain was shot dead by Boba Fett, who was hiding in the dunes. Thereupon carnage broke out, which the Tuskens, who had pitched their camp a few yards away, noticed. The next day, the sandpeople rode their banthas to Jabba's palace, dragging corpses of stormtroopers behind them. At the palace, they were briefly stopped by [[Bib Fortuna]] and some [[Gamorrean]] guards, but Jabba ordered his people to lower their weapons and accepted the tribute of the Tuskens to him. Shortly thereafter, he was informed by Fortuna that a Coruscant cartel had found a way to artificially produce the desert wine, and now the wine was worthless, according to Fortuna. Jabba told his majordomo that he was a fool, took a few sips from the Tusken wine and explained it was priceless.<ref name=\"AoR Jabba\">[[Age of Rebellion - Jabba the Hutt 1|''Age of Rebellion - Jabba the Hutt'' 1]]</ref>\n\n====Getting back at Han Solo====\n[[3 ABY|Three years after]] the Battle of Yavin, Fett was once again hired by Darth Vader to track down the ''Millennium Falcon'', which Vader used in his hunt for Luke Skywalker&mdash;who he had discovered was the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. The resulting capture of the Rebel vessel led to Solo's capture at [[Cloud City]], [[Bespin]], and he was [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]] as a test to ensure the process would work on Skywalker despite Fett's concerns that Solo could result killed. Despite Vader's promises to compensate him if Solo died, Solo survived with no harm and Fett was given the frozen smuggler to take him to Jabba so he could claim the bounty in exchange for his services to the Empire. Solo's friends [[Escape from Cloud City|tried to rescue]] him, but ultimately failed and Fett left with Solo aboard the ''Slave I''.<ref name=\"Episode V\">[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]</ref>\n\nShortly after the Empire's takeover of Cloud City, [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] went to Tatooine alongside [[Chewbacca]], Solo's Wookiee companion, aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' to check if Fett had already delivered Solo to Jabba so in case he hadn't, they could look for leads on Fett. Tricking the [[Harlok Gang]] into escorting them to Jabba's Palace after they saved them from a group of [[TIE line|TIE]] [[starfighter]]s by saying them that as [[Baron Administrator]] of Cloud City he wanted to negotiate with Jabba a deal for shipments of [[tibanna]] gas, Calrissian was brought to Jabba's Palace. After waiting for a while, Calrissian was brought before Jabba by Biff Fortuna. For his relief, Calrissian learned that Solo hadn't been delivered yet, as Fett was nowhere to be seen and Jabba didn't know about Solo's capture.<ref name=\"SW 2020 2\">[[Star Wars (2020) 2|''Star Wars'' (2020) 2]]</ref>\n\nHowever, Jabba demanded to know why Calrissian had lied to the Harlok Gang, as no tibanna arrangement between them had taken place and he had lost his position as Baron Administrator since the Imperial takeover. Calrissian admitted his ruse and proposed Jabba to lend him some of his fighters to take back Cloud City and give him tibanna gas at a good price, only to learn that Jabba had already made a tibanna deal with the Empire. Acknowledging that the former Baron Administrator had arrived on Tatooine with the ''Millennium Falcon'', Jabba decided to take the ''Falcon'' as a partial payment and feed Calrissian to his rancor unless he had something else useful to offer. Desperate, Calrissian offered Jabba the knowledge of who had Solo in possession, but Jabba required more. With nothing more to offer, Calrissian told Jabba that he was currently working with the Rebellion, so he could tip him off from any information he desired to know.<ref name=\"SW 2020 2\" />\n\nEventually, Fett brought Solo to Tatooine, where he collected the bounty Jabba placed on Solo's head.<ref name=\"Moving Target\">''[[Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure]]''</ref> Solo was kept encased in carbonite and put on display in Jabba's court, as Jabba decided it was his favorite decoration. Unknown to Jabba at the time was that Solo's friends were plotting [[Rescue of Han Solo|his rescue]], and that one of his friends, Lando Calrissian, had already infiltrated Jabba's Palace and disguised himself as a guard.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n====Slaying of the Hutt====\n{{Quotetrans|There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.|Jabba the Hutt, to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\nThe plan was put in place upon the arrival of the protocol droid [[C-3PO]] and [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]]. R2 carried with him a message from Skywalker, who declared himself a Jedi Knight and announced his intention to bargain for Solo's life. The young Jedi said he would arrive soon, and he offered the two droids as a gift for the crime lord. Jabba boasted that there would be no bargain, however, and conscripted the two droids into his service. 3PO became his new translator, while R2 would serve drinks on Jabba's sail barge. Later, during a performance of the song \"[[Jedi Rocks]]\" by the [[Max Rebo Band]], Jabba's personal dancer, [[Oola]], resisted his advances toward her, and the Hutt activated the trapdoor and sent her to her death in the rancor pit. The chaotic moment was followed by the arrival of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who, as part of the rescue plan, came disguised as the bounty hunter [[Boushh]] and brought Chewbacca as her \"prisoner.\"<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Tipped off by Boba Fett, Jabba knew it was not really Boushh under the helmet, but he thought the impostor was just a short lowlife smuggler.<ref name=\"Beware\">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> The disguised Organa demanded the bounty on the Wookiee's head and insisted on 50,000 [[credit]]s, which Jabba balked at. Organa threatened him with a [[Thermal detonator|detonator]], leading Jabba to compliment Boushh, and the two agreed on 35,000 credits. Chewbacca was imprisoned in Jabba's dungeons, while Organa waited in the palace so she could free Solo after the court had gone to sleep.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:ProdroidJabba.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jabba rejected Skywalker's proposal and conscripted the droids into his service.]]\n\nOrgana freed Solo from carbonite that evening, but Jabba and his court discovered them. Solo tried to bargain with the crime lord, saying he was on his way to pay Jabba when Fett captured him, but Jabba said it was too late to pay him. The gangster imprisoned Solo and took Organa as his new slave girl, replacing the deceased Oola. A few days later, Skywalker arrived at the palace and was able to gain entry through the use of a mind trick, despite Jabba's order not to allow the Jedi to enter. Jabba's [[majordomo]], Bib Fortuna, presented the Jedi to his master, and Skywalker demanded that Jabba free Solo and his friends, or else face his destruction. Jabba refused, and Skywalker pulled a gun on him, at which point Jabba activated the trapdoor and sent Skywalker and a Gamorrean guard into the rancor pit. The rancor ate the guard, but Skywalker was able to kill the beast, infuriating the gangster. As punishment for the outrage, Jabba ordered that Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca be executed by being fed to the [[sarlacc]], a creature that dwelled in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]].<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_Kills_Jabba_ALNL.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa strangles Jabba to death.]]\nJabba and his court traveled to the Great Pit of Carkoon for the execution. As the proceedings were about to begin, Skywalker offered one last opportunity to free them and threatened to kill Jabba if he did not. The crime lord refused and ordered the prisoners into the pit, but R2 revealed [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|Skywalker's hidden lightsaber]], and the Jedi attacked Jabba's thugs. The growing battle led to chaos on Jabba's sail barge, as his enforcers attempted to kill the Jedi and the Rebels. In the ensuing panic, Organa wrapped the chain she was bound in around Jabba's neck and strangled him to death, bringing an end to the criminal reign of Jabba the Hutt. After his death, Solo and his friends escaped, and Jabba's corpse was blown up when his sail barge exploded over the sarlacc pit.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nAfter Jabba's demise, the Hutt Council was left to determine who would fill Jabba's seat and take reins of his criminal empire.
