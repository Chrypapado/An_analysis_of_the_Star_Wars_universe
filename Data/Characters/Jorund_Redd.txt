I can't... see too well. Everything is spinning|Jorund Redd|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Jorund Redd''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived on the desert world [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nSometime after [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], he was caught in a fight between [[Valarian/Legends|Lady Valarian's]] guards and [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt's]] thugs in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. Redd got hit on his head very hard and started feeling very sick. A [[Medic/Legends|medic]] was sent by the [[2-1B surgical droid|2-1B droid]] [[Billingsly]] to help the local medical staff. When the medic examined Redd and wanted to treat his wounds, thieves sent by Valarian's aide [[Kavas Urdano]] attacked the medic. The medic managed to kill both thieves and then treated Redd's injuries.\n\nRedd told the medic that he had friends in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and suggested that the medic may contact [[Droma Ordo]] in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] to work for the Alliance.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJorund Redd was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CitC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Jorund Redd was added to the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\nJorund Redd could be found in Mos Eisley as part of the low-level quest \"[[W:c:swg:Caught in the Crossfire|Caught in the Crossfire]]\", for players of the [[W:c:swg:|Medic profession]].
