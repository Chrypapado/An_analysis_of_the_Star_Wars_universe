She and her mother were both displaced by the [[Jedi Civil War]] and [[Mandalorian Wars]]. At some point during this [[Time/Legends|time]], she was kidnapped by the [[Exchange]] criminal organization's overseer of the [[Sector/Legends|sector]], a [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] named [[Saquesh]]. While visiting the Refugee Sector, a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Meetra Surik]], met Nadaa, who begged Surik to save her daughter. Surik went to meet with the overseer and attempted to intimidate him into releasing Adana. Surik was unsuccessful and was forced to [[Death/Legends|slay]] the Quarren and his guards in order to free Adana from her [[Prison/Legends|prison]]. The young girl was overjoyed to be free and returned to her mother. Adana's mother was ecstatic to have her daughter back and thanked Surik profusely for her help.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I've taken care of the squid head. You can go back to your mother now.''\"<br />\"''Aww&hellip; I wanted to see you thrash him. Well, thanks!|Meetra Surik and Adana|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nIn [[3951 BBY]],<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Adana lived as a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] with her [[Parent/Legends|mother]], [[Nadaa]], in the [[Refugee Sector]] of [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], a [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] covered entirely by a single [[City/Legends|city]]. Adana and Nadaa were refugees of the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and the [[Jedi Civil War]]. At some point during this [[Time/Legends|time]], Adana was kidnapped by the [[Sector/Legends|sector's]] [[Exchange]] crime boss and overseer, a male [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] named [[Saquesh]]. Saquesh took Adana due to Nadaa's inability to pay a tribute of 600 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to him and planned to sell Adana to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] to recoup the debt.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nWhile visiting the moon in search of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], spoke with Adana's mother, Nadaa. She told Surik that Adana was being held by the Exchange and begged Surik to help her. Surik agreed to help Nadaa rescue Adana and went to meet with Saquesh.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> Surik attempted to intimidate Saquesh into releasing Adana, but Saquesh was not swayed and immediately attacked Surik. The former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knight [[Death/Legends|slew]] the Quarren and his guards and released Adana from her [[Prison/Legends|cell]].<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|127|Saquesh}}</ref> Adana thanked her rescuer and ran off to reunite with her mother. Surik returned to Nadaa, who thanked Surik profusely for her help.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAdana had a sarcastic streak and was fully willing to verbally abuse those she thought were Saquesh's henchmen. She had a special resentment for her captor, Saquesh, wishing to see him physically hurt. While she loved her mother and wished she could be with her again, she also thought being sold into [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] would not be so bad. She believed that anywhere was better than living in the Refugee Sector of Nar Shaddaa.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAdana appears as a non-player character in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''. The reward for freeing her is a random weapon or [[Armor/Legends|armor]] upgrade component. The game offers two additional ways to rescue Adana, either through the use of [[Mind trick/Legends|Force persuasion]] on Saquesh, or by paying the debt. Alternatively, the player can convince Nadaa to sell herself to Saquesh to be with her daughter. This results in [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points. Additionally, the player can convince Saquesh to sell Adana immediately. This also results in dark side points. If this path is followed, the refugee leader, [[Hussef]], will later note that Nadaa went mad and vanished.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{CSWECite|III||Saquesh}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Adana\n|fr=Adana\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]"}}}]}}}}
