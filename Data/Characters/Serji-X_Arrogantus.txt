Never!!|Serji-X Arrogantus|Star Wars (1977) 10}}\n'''Serji-X Arrogantus''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] jockey who toured the professional circuit on [[Caprioril]] during the [[Imperial Period]]. He was nicknamed '''\"the Arrogant One,\"''' due to his continual flagrant disregard for the rules and the dangers of professional [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop racing]]. He was usurped by the corporate-backed [[Dug/Legends|Dug]] racer [[Hodrix]], and as his fans were rapidly siphoned away from him, Arrogantus attempted an incredibly dangerous stunt, in the hopes of attracting some of the attention he had once enjoyed. The stunt resulted in a perilous crash that almost claimed Arrogantus' life. He was deemed unfit to race, so he left the professional circuit to race with [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gangs]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]].\n\nMaking his way to [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]], Arrogantus formed the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]]&mdash;a group of reprobates and degenerates who preyed upon the local [[Farmer/Legends|farmers]], exploiting the weak and innocent. Arrogantus in particular targeted the village of [[Onacra]], with whom he had worked out a compromise in which they would pay him a considerable tithe each year, allaying his need to pillage their settlement. However, Arrogantus tired of the arrangement, and returned to his ransacking of the town. In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], when attempting to claim one of the farm girls, [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri Shen]], Arrogantus and the Cloud-Riders met resistance from a group of gunslingers led by [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] smuggler [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. Arrogantus was later [[Death/Legends|killed]] when a large [[Behemoth from the World Below|beast]] emerged from deep caverns near Onacra, wreaking havoc.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Arrogant One===\n{{Quote|Ignar drives like a mott. I've transmitted him a diagram of the back of my new Flare-P so that he can start getting used to the view.|Serji-X Arrogantus|HoloNet News Vol. 531 54}}\nSerji-X Arrogantus was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who had a career as a professional [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] jockey on [[Caprioril]]<ref name=\"g4\">{{GamerCite|4|The Starhoppers of Aduba-3}}</ref> in the [[Swo-O'Rim racing circuit]].<ref name=\"hnn\">{{Hnn|54|sports/1352_1.html|Ominaz Keeps Top Ranking|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728124905/http://www.holonetnews.com/54/sports/1352_1.html}}</ref> He continued that line of work for several years, and earned himself the moniker of \"the Arrogant One,\" due to his flagrant disregard of both the rules and dangers that distinguished the sport of [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop racing]].<ref name=\"g4\" /> In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], he participated in a race in the city of [[Tasjon]] on [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]], against [[Ignar Ominaz]], the top-ranked swoop racer at the time. It was a rare meeting of the two most significant talents in the swoop-racing field, as the Swo-O'Rim circuit rarely overlapped with the [[TransGal circuit]] that Ominaz raced in. Although Ominaz won the race, Arrogantus finished nine seconds later. When speaking to [[HoloNet News/Legends|HoloNet News]] after the race, Arrogantus confidently decried Ominaz's abilities, confident that his new [[Flare-P swoop]] from [[Mobquet Swoops and Speeders/Legends|Mobquet Swoops and Speeders]] would give him the requisite edge to secure the top seed. HoloNet News believed that Arrogantus would secure the top seed at the [[Plooriod 940]] on [[Corsin/Legends|Corsin]], a month after the Tasjon race.<ref name=\"hnn\" />\n\nArrogantus earned a great many fans for his opulent displays and showboating, but he was eventually usurped by the newcomer [[Hodrix]], a [[Dug/Legends|Dug]] hailing from [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]] who had the advantage of corporate backing. [[Serji-X Arrogantus' manager|Arrogantus' manager]] took a job with the corporations, leaving Arrogantus alone to deal with his own affairs. In an attempt to regain his former standing, Arrogantus attempted a particularly dangerous and foolhardy stunt. As a result, he suffered a bad accident, and his prize [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] was wrecked. The only thing saving Arrogantus himself from death was his helmet. He sustained severe cranial trauma, and was ruled unfit to race. With his career at an end, Arrogantus made his way to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. There, he participated in races with outlaw [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gangs]], and would relay stories of his former glory to the low-lifes that he was forced to gravitate to. He eventually made his way to [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]], and formed a gang, the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]]&mdash;a pack of miscreants who utilized stripped down [[skyspeeder]]s and [[Swoop/Legends|swoops]]. They were loyal to Arrogantus only through their own ignorance. As his vehicle of choice, Arrogantus flew a modified [[Peregrine-340 airspeeder]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n===A devil===\n[[File:Serji-XArrogantus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Serji-X Arrogantus in the Agrilat Swamp on Corellia]]\nThe Cloud-Riders maintained a small camp in the hills near the farming villages of Aduba-3. Arrogantus devised an extortion racket, in which they would prey upon the local farmers to their own benefit. They raided the villages, stealing both crops and women, before selling them to [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] and [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]] respectively in the port town of [[Tun Aduban]] for [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].<ref name=\"g4\" /> They would also force the [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] that farmers used for both livestock and transportation to stampede.<ref name=\"m8\" /> The closest of their targets was the village of [[Onacra]]. Rather than allow Arrogantus to repeatedly ransack their community, the village leaders, among them [[Oncho Shen]] and [[Ramiz]], formulated a compromise with him. They would pay him an annual tithe of 9,000 credits, and Arrogantus would bypass Onacra altogether. He and the Cloud-Riders accepted the deal, as it required less hauling of grain and slaves to Tun Aduban.<ref name=\"g4\" /> On the second year of their agreement, Arrogantus and his Cloud-Riders made a spectacular entrance into the town, crashing into several of the dwellings for effect.<ref name=\"m9\">[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars 9: Showdown on a Wasteland World'']]</ref> After three years, however, Arrogantus tired of the deal, and prepared to resume his ransacking of Onacra.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nIn [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], a newcomer, [[Warto]], joined Arrogantus' gang. Arrogantus was impressed with the [[Boltrunian/Legends|Boltrunian's]] strength, and his hunger for vengeance against several individuals who had humiliated him in the past. Arrogantus gave Warto a skyspeeder that had belonged to a Cloud Rider that had succumbed to a [[high-hound]] attack.<ref name=\"g4\" /> Warto alerted Arrogantus to the fact that a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], had been hired by the Onacrans to defend the village, and to that end had assembled a makeshift team of warriors,<ref name=\"m8\" /> later to be known as the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]].<ref name=\"g4\" /> Arrogantus, Warto, and the rest of the Cloud-Riders rode to Tun Aduban to confront Solo, and while the Boltrunian goaded the Corellian, Arrogantus instructed him not to open fire until he had given word.<ref name=\"m8\" />\n\n===Downfall and death===\n[[File:Serjigoesskiing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Arrogantus does battle with the forces of Han Solo.]]\nConfirming that he could approach Solo and the Star-Hoppers under a flag of truce, Arrogantus suggested that the Corellian abandon his mission. He claimed he was prepared to pay Solo a small sum for him to not work for the Onacrans, but felt sure that his price would by much higher than whatever the villagers could offer him. The Corellian countered with the fact that the villagers were offering all they could afford, and in Solo's view that was worth more than Arrogantus' credits. Solo then advised Arrogantus to leave the village alone&mdash;the assertion amused the gang leader, as did Solo's ragtag team. Insulted, one of the team members, young [[Jimm Doshun]], drew his weapon on Arrogantus, before being subdued by another Star-Hopper, [[Amaiza Foxtrain/Legends|Amaiza Foxtrain]]. Pointing out that Solo's team were already fighting amongst themselves, Arrogantus departed with the Cloud-Riders, confident that he would not be threatened by the newcomers.<ref name=\"m8\" />\n\nMeanwhile, one of the Onacran farm girls, [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri Shen]], had aroused Arrogantus' interest. He became genuinely smitten with her, and although he was more than capable of seizing her with brute force, he sought to win her over with his charms. As he returned to Onacra with the intention of doing just that,<ref name=\"g4\" /> he found that the Star-Hoppers had not heeded his warning, and were defending the village. Arrogantus, leading his Cloud-Riders, opened fire, hoping to match the spectacle of the previous years' entrance into the town. Declaring his intention to claim Shen as his own, Arrogantus approached the village, and met resistance from the Star-Hoppers.<ref name=\"m9\" />\n\nA skirmish ensued, and eventually a giant beast entered the fray. Narrowly avoiding one of the beast's claws, Arrogantus recalled hearing tell of such a monster in his youth. In particular, he remembered that such monsters usually left a path of destruction in their wake, and realized that if he allowed the monster to continue on its rampage unabated, it would destroy Onacra, preventing Arrogantus from claming either tribute or \"female amusement.\" He ordered his men to fire on the beast, but their collective efforts were in vain. The Cloud-Riders fell to the beast, who was seemingly ignoring Solo's Star-Hoppers altogether.<ref name=\"m10\" />\n\nArrogantus could do little but watch as the behemoth engineered a landslide, killing a slew of the Cloud-Riders instantaneously. His subordinates protested, but Arrogantus was determined to have the beast destroyed, as well as claim Shen. When only a few of the Cloud-Riders remained, Arrogantus briefly entertained the possibility of retreat, but once again resolved to destroy the beast. He noticed one of the elderly villagers, the \"[[Old One]],\" controlling the beast. Remembering that the Old One had continually talked of controlling a legendary monster, he realized that the villager was the source of his problem. Arrogantus raced towards the Old One with the intent of destroying him, but both he and the Old One were then trampled by the behemoth, killing them instantly.<ref name=\"m10\" /> The Cloud-Riders later dissolved, and began fighting amongst themselves for possession of the savings back at their camp. Two years later, Arrogantus was profiled by historian [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Serjixarrogantus.png|thumb|left|150px|Serji-X Arrogantus]]\nSerji-X Arrogantus was noted for his callous disregard for the rules of swoop racing, and his arrogant attitude towards the real hazards and dangers posed by the sport. Such was his arrogance that he was nicknamed \"the Arrogant One.\" He enjoyed a strong fanbase, but upon losing them to the newcomer Hodrix, Arrogantus was driven to desperate measures, attempting an incredibly foolhardy stunt that almost claimed his life. He was able to attract unintelligent low-lifes to his cause when he formulated the Cloud-Riders, and although he was pragmatic enough to accept a deal with the village of Onacra, his impatience eventually got the better of him, and he returned to his pillaging ways.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nArrogantus was labaled a \"devil\" by the villagers of Onacra. Conversely, he believed himself to possess delicate sensibilities, and was not particularly one to bandy words with his opponents. Respectively, he had a low opinion of the farmers, calling them \"peons,\" and Han Solo's Star-Hoppers. He was not averse to threatening his opponents, however, but had an inflated opinion of his own importance, scoffing at the idea that the assembled Star-Hoppers could even hope to challenge him.<ref name=\"m8\" /> Arrogantus valued dramatic and opulent entrances,<ref name=\"m9\" /> and determined that he would never surrender to anyone. When the behemoth of Aduba-3 decimated his men, it affected him personally, and he resolved that the monster would die at his hands.<ref name=\"m10\" />\n\nArrogantus considered himself a gentleman in private, although he conceded that he was a maladroit one. Rather than simply claiming his beloved, Merri Shen, though force, he wanted to seduce and woo her with his charms. In addition to his charms, Arrogantus possessed a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], a personal skyspeeder, and a fake identification. He also had the ability to speak, read, and write [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], and could also speak [[Dug (language)/Legends|Dug]].<ref name=\"g4\" /> For his attire, he donned a brown leather flight jacket, and a set of green-lensed flight goggles.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSerji-X Arrogantus first appeared in [[Star Wars (1977) 8|''Star Wars'' (1977) 8]] ([[1978]]), which was written by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Howard Chaykin]]. He was killed off two issues later, in [[Star Wars (1977) 10|''Star Wars'' (1977) 10]] (1978), for which [[Donald F. Glut|Don Glut]] was added to the writing team. The issues were loosely based on [[Wikipedia:Akira Kurosawa|Akira Kurosawa's]] film [[Wikipedia:Seven Samurai|''Seven Samurai'']] ([[1950s|1954]]),<ref name=\"db\" /> and Arrogantus filled the role of primary antagonist.
