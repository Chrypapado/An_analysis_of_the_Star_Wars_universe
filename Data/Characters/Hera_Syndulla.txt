Born the daughter of [[General]] [[Cham Syndulla]] and [[Eleni Syndulla]] on [[Ryloth]] with a [[Hera Syndulla's brother|brother]] who died young, she saw firsthand the devastation of the [[Clone Wars]] and the reign of the Empire on her [[homeworld]]. Syndulla became an expert [[pilot]] and left her homeworld and her father's [[Free Ryloth Movement|planetary resistance]] behind, setting off across [[the galaxy]] to build her own resistance movement against the Empire aboard her [[VCX-100 light freighter|starship]], the ''[[Ghost]]''. [[Kanan Jarrus]], a [[Jedi]] who survived [[Order 66]], joined her during the [[Gorse conflict]] and eventually became her lover and father of her son. Her crew, the [[Spectres]], mounted an insurgency on [[Lothal]] and was eventually comprised of [[Mandalorian]] warrior [[Sabine Wren]], [[Lasat]] survivor [[Garazeb Orrelios]], Syndulla's life-long [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]], and [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]].\n\nThe small rebellion Hera led on Lothal gained the notice of [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and his efforts to coordinate activities between various rebel cells across the galaxy. Hera and the Spectres joined one of these cells, [[Phoenix Cell]], and she eventually became [[Phoenix Leader]]. With Phoenix Cell, Syndulla helped expand their forces, gain new allies, and establish a [[Chopper Base|base of operations]] on the remote world [[Atollon]], though they were unable to help Lothal as the Empire [[Siege of Lothal|strengthened its grip]] on the planet. As the rebellion began to grow larger and become more of a threat, the Empire selected [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] and gave him the task of dismantling the rebels. Hera continued to lead Phoenix Cell and became an influential leader of the rebellion. Hera's cell was among the first to join the formal Rebel Alliance upon its creation. Thrawn, however, located their base and [[Battle of Atollon|launched an offensive]] against them on Atollon. Although they were significantly weakened and their base was destroyed, Hera, the Spectres, and several starships managed to escape the onslaught.\n\nWith their base gone, Hera and Phoenix Cell joined the [[Massassi Group]] on [[Yavin 4]], where Hera continued to lead the rebellion against the Empire. Hera and the Spectres returned to Lothal not long after, seeking to finally free the planet from the Empire. Despite initial setbacks in gaining support from the Alliance, Hera [[Attack on Lothal|led]] a squadron of fighters to destroy the [[Imperial Armory Complex]] on Lothal, but Thrawn's fleet managed to crush her forces and take her prisoner. Without Alliance support, the Spectres led a [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|rescue mission]] to free her. As they made their escape, Kanan sacrificed himself to save Hera and the others from the explosion of the [[Lothal City fuel depot|Imperial fuel depot]]. With newfound determination following Kanan's death, Hera, the Spectres, and various allies they made along their journey [[Liberation of Lothal|managed]] to defeat Thrawn and free Lothal from the Empire. Sometime after the liberation, Hera gave birth to Kanan's son, [[Jacen Syndulla]].\n\nIn the following years during the [[Galactic Civil War]], Hera continued to be one of the most crucial leaders in the Alliance. Hera took part in the Alliance's pivotal moments on [[Battle of Scarif|Scarif]], [[Assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks|Mako-Ta]], [[Hoth]], and eventually, [[Endor]], the [[Battle of Endor|battle]] which saw the death of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and the fracture of the Empire. Following the battle, the Alliance reorganized into the [[New Republic]], with Syndulla as one of its top military leaders. She continued to oversee the [[Barma Battle Group]], which included [[Alphabet Squadron]], throughout the aftermath of Endor, and participated in the Empire's final defeat at the [[Battle of Jakku]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Flying is&hellip;it's about a ''feeling''.\"<br />\"What do you mean?\"<br />\"When I close my eyes and picture myself up there, I ''feel'' it.

While working as a pilot, she lost more than one friend to collisions with purrgil.<ref name=\"The Call\">{{Rebels|The Call}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of Ryloth, A [[BTL Y-wing starfighter]] crashed in front of her home.

My hope is that you won't ''ever'' have to live a life like mine.|Hera Syndulla and her father, Cham|Devil's Deal}}\nFollowing the defeat of the Separatists, the Galactic Republic [[Proclamation of the New Order|became]] the Galactic Empire. They asked the people of Ryloth to disarm and leave their protection to them. Her father was ready to lay down his weapons and live in peace, but many other Twi'leks, such as her father's friend [[Gobi Glie]], did not trust the Empire. Hera, along with Chopper, decided to aid her \"Uncle\" Gobi in spying on a [[Ryloth Imperial refinery|new Imperial refinery]]. However, her dreams of flight led her to be caught by the [[clone trooper]]s and she was taken home by [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Howzer]], who declined to report the incident. Hera was scolded by her father, but her mother was more sympathetic to Gobi's misgivings about the Empire.<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" />\n\n[[File:Omega_meets_Hera_Syndulla.png|thumb|right|200px|Omega meets Hera Syndulla]]\nThat night, Gobi talked Hera into accompanying him to make a supply run by allowing her to pilot the ship. They rendezvoused on one of Ryloth's [[moon]]s with [[Clone Force 99|a squad of former clone commandos]] who were clandestinely delivering weapons to Gobi. As the adults discussed business, Hera befriended [[Omega]], a younger girl who was part of the team. Omega showed Hera the inside of [[Havoc Marauder|their shuttle]] until the deal was concluded.<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" /> Before they parted ways, Omega gave Hera the squad's comm frequency.<ref name=\"Rescue on Ryloth\" />\n\nOn the way back, their ship was shot down by an Imperial sharpshooter [[CT-9904]] \"Crosshair\" who had planted a tracking device on the ship. They were captured by Vice Admiral [[Rampart]] and Senator [[Orn Free Taa]], who was still jealous of her father's influence on the people of Ryloth. Taa insisted that all of them, including Hera, be imprisoned without trial. But as the Juggernaut was returning, it was [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Ryloth)|attacked]] by Cham and Eleni, determined to rescue their daughter. After the fight, Eleni placed Hera in a speeder piloted by Chopper. But Rampart had CT-9904 shoot Taa in order to frame Cham and had additional troopers ready to capture them. Eleni called for Chopper to escape with Hera as they were arrested.<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" />\n\nIn desperation, Hera called on the only armed force she knew of: the squad of clones that Gobi had just dealt with. Fortunately, Omega was able to convince the others to help. The Squad, with Hera's help, attacked the refinery to distract the Imperial Forces while they rescued the prisoners. Chopper infiltrated the factory but was captured, prompting Hera and Omega to steal a [[Nu-class attack/transport shuttle]] to rescue him. Hera's first solo flight was less than impressive, but very effective, sowing great confusion among the Imperial ranks until the clones' shuttle, the ''Havoc Marauder'' arrived. The two shuttles quickly reduced the factory's entrance to smoldering ruins while the rest of the team rescued Hera's parents.<ref name=\"Rescue on Ryloth\">{{TBB|Rescue on Ryloth}}</ref>\n\nIn time, the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] led Cham launched a resistance struggle against the Empire. During this resistance struggle, Eleni was killed and Cham came to prioritize Ryloth's freedom over his own family. As a result, strains developed in the relationship between Hera and her father. Hera was angry at Cham for neglecting her while Cham was upset with his daughter for devoting more attention to Chopper, whom he labeled a \"second-rate junk pile.\" Hera's relationship with Cham was further strained when she joined the wider rebellion against the Empire rather than taking part in the Twi'lek resistance struggle.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\n====Relief mission to Ryloth====\nFollowing the [[Mission to Ryloth|failed assassination attempt]] on Emperor Palpatine and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], Hera traveled with the [[Karthakk Group]] aboard the [[YT-209 freighter]] [[Eclipse (freighter)|''Eclipse'']] on a [[Relief mission to Ryloth|relief mission]] to deliver a supply of [[gattis-root]] extract to the Imperial&ndash;occupied world. Due to an Imperial crackdown, members of the underground [[Free Ryloth Movement]] were unable to obtain gattis-root outside of Imperial [[medcenter]]s. Gattis-root extract was used to treat [[Bybbec fever]] among the Twi'lek. Despite her strained relationship with her father, Hera volunteered for the mission out of solidarity with her people.<ref name=\"Mercy Mission\">{{Shortstory|story=Mercy Mission (short story)|sformatted=Mercy Mission|book=The Rise of the Empire}}</ref>\n\nAfter clearing Imperial space control, Hera decided to disengage from the Imperial auto-pilot system once they had reached the right altitude and divert from their official route. In response, [[Governor]] [[Delian Mors]] dispatched a flight of [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter|V-wing starfighters]] to pursue the rogue freighter. Despite evading the Imperial fighters, the ''Eclipse''{{'s}} engines, long-range sensors, and transmitters were damaged. While the group's captain [[Krysiant Rheden]] was wounded, the group decided to proceed with their mission.<ref name=\"Mercy Mission\" />\n\nHera landed the ''Eclipse'' in an abandoned commercial landing zone near the capital [[Lessu]]. After unloading the supplies and making their repairs, Hera flew the freighter back into space. Despite Mors' efforts, the insurgents managed to escape into hyperspace. Following the mission, Hera set a course for [[Manda]]. She and the [[Nikto]] gunner [[Ul'ligan]] reflected on the shared solidarity between the two peoples while the Free Ryloth leader [[Goll]] complimented Hera for her leadership.<ref name=\"Mercy Mission\" />\n\n====The Gorse conflict====\n=====Tracking down Count Vidian=====\n{{Quote|This thing hasn't flown in years!''\"<br />\"''You've got to talk to it right.''\"<br />\"''I thought ''I'' was a good pilot.

She eventually became an agent of [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]],<ref name=\"Helmet Collection 52\">{{HelmetCollectionCite|52|Databank A-Z|Hera Syndulla&ndash;Ahsoka Tano}}</ref> and joined a rebel network led by a mysterious figure known as [[Ahsoka Tano|Fulcrum]], who was the former [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] Ahsoka Tano.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref> Despite her differences with her father Cham about Ryloth's struggle, she was still inspired by his reputation and work as a rebel leader to follow his path.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" /> As a rebel operative, Hera tailed the movements of [[Count]] [[Denetrius Vidian]], the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine's]] efficiency expert, who was charged with speeding up production on Imperial worlds and was reputed for his disregard towards the lives of other sentients. After learning that Vidian would be visiting the [[Gorse system]] from the [[Gorse]]&ndash;based surveillance operative [[Hetto]], Hera traveled to the system in her [[VCX-100 light freighter]] ''[[Ghost]]''. Hetto worked at the [[Transcept Media Solutions]]' [[Myder's Mynocks]] surveillance division and had managed to contact Hera via [[HoloNet]].<ref name=\"AND\">[[A New Dawn (novel)|''A New Dawn'']]</ref>\n\nBy masking the ''Ghost''{{'s}} transponder signal, Hera managed to infiltrate the mining moon of [[Cynda]], which was home to vast reserves of [[thorilide]], crystals used in the manufacture of [[deflector shield]]s. Upon landing, she knocked out a [[stormtrooper]], who demanded to see her ID. While there, she witnessed Vidian murdering the [[Neimoidian]] guild director [[Palfa]] for refusing to implement an age cap on workers. Later, she witnessed a freight pilot named [[Kanan Jarrus]] standing up to Vidian when the Count accosted an elderly worker named [[Okadiah Garson]]. While Hera admired Kanan's courage and wanted to recruit him, she decided to focus on her mission to investigate Vidian's reason for visiting the Gorse system. Unknown to Hera, Kanan was a former Jedi Padawan who had survived the [[Great Jedi Purge]].<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nAfter returning to her ship, Hera managed to intercept the mining companies' signals and discovered that a dissident miner named [[Skelly]] had resisted Imperial arrest and conducted an illegal test bombing in the mining moon's [[Zone Forty-Two]]. Skelly was captured by Kanan who handed him over to Moonglow Polychemical. Kanan was angry that Skelly's actions had endangered the lives of miners. Viewing him as a potential ally, Hera decided to break him free and tracked him down to [[Moonglow Polychemical]]'s refinery in [[Shaketown]]. To free Skelly, Hera hired a local criminal gang called the [[Sarlaccs]] to steal the company's [[hovertruck]]. This distraction allowed Hera to free Skelly from his restraints. She then told Skelly that she would make contact with him.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nWhile Hera had paid the gang's leader [[Charko]] fifty [[Credit]]s and promised another fifty after the diversion, Charko then demanded another hundred credits. When Hera was unable to pay, Charko and his men attempted to rob her. Hera was rescued by Kanan, who fought the Sarlaccs off and won her admiration. Before leaving, Hera told him her name. Later, using a tracking device she had slipped into Skelly's utility pocket, Hera tracked down Skelly to his apartment to his home in [[Crispus Commons]], a housing project for homeless Clone Wars veterans. Hera had hoped to recruit Skelly to the rebellion but dismissed him as a conspiracy theorist after Skelly claimed that prolonged baradium mining could destroy Cynda. He claimed that the mining companies were covering this information up.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nBelieving Skelly to be a \"crackpot,\" Hera left to meet with her local contact Hetto at a pub in [[Gorse City]] called [[The Asteroid Belt]], whom she regarded as the main reason for her visit to the Gorse system. However, Hera was unable to meet up with her contact Hetto because he was arrested by Imperial forces, who had been monitoring his HoloNet activities. Before his arrest, Hetto arranged for his [[Sullustan]] colleague [[Zaluna Myder]] to meet up with Hera and gave her a [[data cube]] containing the information she wanted to pass to Hera. Instead, she met Kanan and Zaluna, with the latter informing her about Hetto's arrest. Zaluna managed to pass Hera information that Hetto had downloaded from the Imperial channel to the Transcept database including information about a mysterious individual named Lemuel Tharsa, a freelance mining consultant who worked for the Empire.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nZaluna departed shortly before the arrival of Skelly, who had come to ask Kanan to lend him his ID. Skelly had learned that Count Vidian would be conducting an inspection of the Moonglow Polychemical refinery. Skelly wanted to convince Vidian to halt thorilide mining on Cynda. Hera and Kanan expressed skepticism about the success of Skelly's plan. Before they could argue further, an Imperial stormtrooper patrol arrived. Despite their differences with Skelly, Kanan, Hera, and the establishment's owner Okadiah hid Skelly in a closet. While Kanan refused to lend Skelly his ID card, Hera managed to convince Kanan to lend her his ID card so that she could spy in Vidian and find out why he was visiting the Gorse system. Kanan complied provided \"no crazy stuff\" took place.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\n=====Saving Cynda=====\n{{Quote|They're not trying to make a difference.

While Hera infiltrated the facility, he would wait outside with the bus and pretend that he was having engine trouble. After she returned, he offered to travel with her on her starship ''Ghost''. Hera hid in the refinery's ventilation shafts. Her mission was complicated when Skelly infiltrated the facility and tried to convince Vidian to halt mining operations on Cynda. However, Vidian was unwilling to listen to reason and attacked Skelly. She later witnessed Vidian callously murdering Moonglow's [[Boss]] [[Lal Grallik]], after she informed him that the refinery could not meet the Empire's decision to triple Gorse's thorilide quota. When her grieving husband [[Gord Grallik]] arrived, Hera identified Vidian as his wife's murderer.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nAfter leaving the refinery, she found that Kanan had been detained by the [[Imperial Navy]] [[Captain]] [[Rae Sloane]] for lacking proper identification. Sloane also wanted to detain Hera for similar reasons but released the two after Vidian cut his tour short and made plans to return to Sloane's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Ultimatum]]''. However, Skelly bombed Vidian's shuttle [[Truncheon (Lambda-class)|''Truncheon'']] in an attempt to assassinate the Count. Vidian survived and he and his surviving entourage commandeered the hoverbus and headed to a [[spaceport]] where another shuttle was waiting. Hera and Kanan followed Vidian in a hovertruck while Skelly continued the pursuit on his [[speeder bike]].<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nSkelly bombed Vidian's shuttle but was unable to kill him. Vidian tried to attack Hera and Kanan but was distracted by a vindictive Gord, who had come to seek justice for his wife's murder. While Vidian killed Gord, Hera along with Kanan and Skelly escaped in the hoverbus. Hera drove the bus through the streets of Shaketown and managed to outrun and destroy several pursuing [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transports]] and two [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. The three rebels managed to land the bus in a quarry and soon discovered that Zaluna had accidentally stowed aboard in the bus' toilet. Zaluna helped the fugitives by leading them through routes that were not being watched by surveillance cameras.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nThe rebels sought refuge at Okadiah's establishment, The Asteroid Field. There, she counseled Skelly to join forces with other like-minded rebels rather than acting against the Empire solely in his own self interest. During this meeting in a small, crowded room, Hera began to form an informal rebel consisting of herself, Kanan, Skelly, and Zaluna; the latter decided to join after learning that she had been dismissed by the Empire from her job at Transcept Media due to her friendship with Hetto. Zaluna feared that the Empire would soon find out that she was in the company of known rebels.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nAfter watching material from the hoverbus surveillance cab, Hera and her fellow rebels discovered that Vidian had come up with a new plan to destroy Cynda in order to gain direct access to its thorilide. The rebels' fears were proven when Vidian conducted a test bombing on the mining site on Cynda. This explosion was witnessed by many people on Gorse including Hera and her companions. Since Kanan's friend Okadiah and his team had recently gone up to the moon, Hera and the rebels traveled there on Kanan's cargo hauler ''Expedient''. Upon arriving, they discovered that the explosion had claimed the lives of all the miners including Okadiah, who died in Kanan's arms while Hera while watched.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nSatisfied with the results of the test bombing, Count Vidian and Captain Sloane ordered that all empty mining cargo ships in the Gorse system follow the ''Ultimatum'' to his [[Calcoraan Depot|depot]] in the [[Calcoraan system]]. Vidian planned to use the freighters to unload [[Baradium-357]] onto Cynda in order to detonate the moon. To cover up the test bombing, the Empire claimed that Moonglow Polychemical's negligence had cause the explosion and nationalized the company's assets. Imperial media claimed that Vidian was organizing a heroic effort to stabilize Cynda. Resolving to stop Vidian, Hera and her rebel cell traveled on the ''Expedient'' to the Calcoraan Depot.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nInfiltrating the facility, Hera and Kanan managed to find their way into Vidian's personal chambers, which included an advanced medcenter. The two were quickly ambushed by Vidian but were saved when Skelly and Zaluna incapacitated the count with a sleeping serum. After downloading the cyborg's mind into a portable terminal and [[holoprojector]], the rebels discovered that Vidian had once been the \"mining consultant\" Lemuel Tharsa before he had succumbed to [[Shilmer's syndrome]]. They also found out that Vidian had faked the test bombing results on Cynda to show that the detonation would not destroy the moon's thorilide crystals; when the original report showed otherwise. Kanan came up with a plan to foil Vidian's plot by informing Captain Sloane of Vidian's deception. Posing as an agent of the Emperor, Kanan was able to appeal to Sloane's patriotism and successfully convinced her to forward the original report to the Emperor.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nHera and her fellow rebels then traveled back to the Gorse system to stop Vidian's plan. Upon arriving, Kanan used the ''Expedient'' to harass the freighters and prevent them from unloading their baradium cargo onto Cynda's surface. The rebel freighter managed to shoot down several TIE fighters before breaching Vidian's flagship ''[[Forager]]''. Once aboard, Hera and her companions fought their way through the factory ship to Vidian's command center. Despite losing Skelly in the factory, the rebels managed to confront Vidian. The cyborg Count managed to overpower the rebels and blinded Zaluna during the struggle. Before Vidian could detonate Cynda, he was stopped by an unlikely opponent: Captain Sloane.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\nBy this stage, the Emperor had discovered Vidian's deception. Acting in the name of the Empire, Sloane ordered her crew to shut down the Detonation Link and instructed her stormtroopers to arrest the Count. Still defiant, Vidian revealed that he could still control the detonation link. Undaunted, Sloane ordered Imperial forces to bombard and destroy Vidian's ship. During the ensuing bombardment, Hera, Kanan, and Zaluna managed to escape in an [[escape pod]]. Kanan also revealed his identity by using [[the Force]] to save them from being crushed to death by a falling catwalk. Meanwhile, Vidian was killed by a vengeful Skelly, who detonated a bomb that destroyed the ''Forager''; saving Cynda from destruction. After transporting Zaluna to a safe world to live out her days, Hera and Kanan decided to travel together as rebels on her ship ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"AND\" />\n\n====The Spectres====\n[[File:Star_Wars_Rebels_Poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hera and her rebel cell]]\nFollowing the [[Gorse conflict]], Hera, Kanan, and Chopper formed a rebel cell known as the [[Spectres]] that was based on the ''Ghost''. They were eventually joined by the [[Lasat]] warrior [[Garazeb Orrelios]] and the former [[Mandalorian]] [[Imperial cadet]] [[Sabine Wren]].<ref name=\"VG\" /> After [[Raid on an Imperial supply convoy|raiding]] an Imperial supply convoy on Kanan's suggestion, Hera, Kanan, and Chopper found themselves under attack by Imperial TIE fighters. When the attack disabled both the ''Ghost''{{'s}} shields and internal communications system, Hera and Kanan began giving Chopper conflicting orders over what to fix first. A comment from Kanan passed on to Hera by Chopper aggravated her enough to go on the offensive and destroy a TIE fighter herself. Chopper wound up destroying the final starfighter, and his efforts were praised by Hera before she took the ''Ghost'' into hyperspace.<ref name=\"The Machine in the Ghost\" />\n\nAnother mission required Sabine to create a diversion so the ''Ghost'' could take off. After Hera signaled Sabine that they were in position, the Mandalorian detonated an [[Paint bomb|explosive]] in a TIE fighter landing platform, drawing attention from the departing ''Ghost''. As she flew away, Hera remarked to Sabine that the explosion was even visible from her position.<ref name=\"ArtAttack\">{{Rebels|Art Attack}}</ref>\n\n====Enter Ezra Bridger====\nSometime later, Sabine, Zeb and Kanan were tasked with [[Heist in Capital City|stealing]] some crates containing [[blaster]]s from the Empire. As part of the plan, Hera and Chopper would pick up the rebels and their stolen supplies outside the city. During, Hera's rebel companions encountered [[Ezra Bridger]], a fourteen-year-old orphan who lived on the streets of Lothal's [[Capital City]]. Ezra tried to steal several of the crates but reluctantly hitched a ride aboard the ''Ghost''. This proved to be Hera's first encounter with the young Ezra, who later became a valuable crew member of the ''Ghost'' and Kanan's Jedi Padawan. After losing their Imperial pursuers in space, Hera and her crew returned to Lothal and sold the stolen blasters to the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]]. The rebels then gave the proceeds to the poor people of [[Lothal re-settlement camp 43|Tarkintown]], who had been dispossessed by the Empire.<ref name=\"SoR\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref>\n\nHera and her companions then embarked on a [[Mission to free Wookiee prisoners|mission]] to rescue several [[Wookiee]] [[Slavery|slaves]] that were being transported on an [[Transport 651|Imperial transport ship]] to the [[spice]] mining planet of [[Kessel]]. Unknown to the Spectres, the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] had planned to lure them into a trap. When Zeb and Chopper objected to the presence of the stowaway Ezra, Hera and Sabine argued that they could not dump the human youth since he knew too much. Hera also promised to keep an eye on the young human youth. When they went to rescue the Wookiees from an Imperial transport, their transmissions were blocked. Hera and Ezra noticed a [[Star Destroyer]] coming out of hyperspace taking them aboard. Hera told Ezra to warn the other rebels who had gone aboard. When he did, they escaped the imperials except for Ezra himself who was grabbed by Agent Kallus.<ref name=\"SoR\" />\n\nFollowing their escape from the Imperial trap, Hera successfully convinced her rebel comrades to rescue Ezra from the Star Destroyer. After they escaped again, Hera said Ezra's parents must be worried sick and was upset to hear that he had no parents. While Ezra was on board the [[Lawbringer]], he learned that the Wookiees were really being held in the [[Spice Mines of Kessel]] so the rebels went there to [[Rescue on Kessel|save them]]. Hera was forced to flee the scene when the Ghost was ambushed by TIEs. She ran a \"[[22 pickup]]\" to rescue her comrades. Upon returning to Lothal, Ezra returned [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron|Kanan's holocron]] that he had grabbed earlier. After noticing that Ezra had opened the holocron, she realized that the teenager was strong in the Force. However, Ezra also stole [[Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber]] prior to their disembarkation and Kanan followed Ezra to his hideout to retrieve it. In the end, Kanan managed to convince Ezra to return his lightsaber in return for training the boy as his Padawan. As a result, Ezra became a crew member of the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"SoR\" />\n\n====Theft of disruptors====\n[[File:Her_talking_Ezra.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hera talking with Ezra about the T-7 ion disruptors.]]\nRunning low on [[fuel]] and supplies, the crew of the ''Ghost'' decided to accept another [[Mission to steal Imperial weapons|job]] from the crime lord Vizago to steal a shipment of weapons from the spaceport on [[Garel]], a planet near Lothal. While Hera traveled to Garel in the ''Ghost'', her comrades took a [[Star Commuter 2000]] [[ST-45|transport shuttle]]. After a fire fight with the Imperial authorities on Garel, Hera and her fellow rebels escaped Garel with the weapons. These weapons turned out to be illegal [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s, which had been used during the Imperial subjugation of [[Lasan]], Zeb's homeworld. While the [[Imperial Senate]] had banned these firearms, the Imperial [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]] had wanted to restart production on Lothal. During their escape, the rebels also picked up the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]] and his astromech companion [[R2-D2]]; who had been sent on a secret mission by [[Senator]] Bail Organa to prevent the T-7 disruptors from falling into the hands of the Empire.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of the T-7 disruptors distressed Zeb, who was one of the few Lasat to survive the [[Siege of Lasan|Fall of Lasan]]. After Zeb locked Ezra out of his cabin, Hera told the teenager about the role that these weapons had played in the destruction of his species. Upon returning to Lothal, the ''Ghost'' rendezvoused at a pre-arranged location with Vizago. Unknown to Hera and the other crew members, C-3PO, who was unaware of his master's true mission and believed that the rebels were \"criminals,\" made an emergency call to Agent Kallus and revealed their whereabouts. Before the rebels could complete their transaction with Vizago, they were attacked by an Imperial force led by Kallus. Vizago fled without paying the crew of the ''Ghost''. However, the rebels were unwilling to allow the disruptors to fall into Imperial hands again and fought against Kallus' forces.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\nDuring the fighting, Hera helped Sabine to open the crates containing the disruptors and then used one to shoot down one of Kallus' [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP]] walkers. Meanwhile Sabine and R2-D2 succeeded in overloading the disruptors, causing them to explode and effectively denying them to the Empire. In the midst of the skirmish, Ezra also managed to save Zeb from being killed by Kallus, who had played a role in the genocide of the Lasat species. Kanan asked Hera to get the boy on board while he himself took the Lasat on the ship. Following their skirmish with Imperial forces on Lothal, Hera and her crew headed into space where they rendezvoused with C-3PO's and R2-D2's owner, Senator Organa on the ''[[Tantive IV]]''. The grateful Senator paid them generously for returning his droids and destroying the disruptors.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" />\n\n====Acquiring supplies====\n{{Quote|Enough. This is my ship you're wrecking, and I want you off.|Hera, to Ezra and Zeb|Fighter Flight}}\n[[File:Hera_expels_Zeba_Ezra.jpg|thumb|right|226px|Hera expelling Zeb and Ezra, giving them a market list.]]\nAfter Zeb and Ezra made a mess in the cargo hold of the ''Ghost'', Hera sent them off the ship to buy supplies in a local Lothalian town. Among the items Hera requested was a [[meiloorun fruit]], something not commonly found on Lothal. Because of its rarity, Hera hoped Ezra and Zeb would be gone longer, leaving her and Kanan some time to relax. Some time later, Hera received a call from Zeb, who had stolen a TIE fighter. Kanan then instructed them to hurry to the meeting point. When Ezra and Zeb failed to return in time, Hera began to worry. Thankfully, the two eventually returned. After hearing them out, the entire crew boarded the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Fighter Flight\">{{Rebels|Fighter Flight}}</ref>\n\n====Fool's Run====\nAfter damaging the ''Ghost'' while escaping some TIE Fighters, Hera and her fellow rebels stopped at [[Osisis Station]], a space station in the Regani sector run by [[Galus Vez]], a besalisk ship parts dealer. They had previously dealt with Galus, but due to Imperial activity nearby, Galus refused to deal with Hera, because it would be too much trouble to get rid of any sign that the Spectres were there. Galus proposed racing her in the Fool's Run, a race through a nearby asteroid field, in return for the spare parts. Hera accepted, but the others were hesitant since if she lost, they'd lose the ''Ghost''. Hera's terms for the race were that guns and turrets weren't allowed, which Galus accepted. What she didn't know was that Galus rigged the asteroids with thrusters that could push asteroids into each other crushing any ship in-between them. Luckily for Hera, Kanan and Ezra used the Force to do the same to Galus, which gave Hera the edge she needed to win. Unfortunately, Galus never planned to give them the parts, and threatened Kanan, Ezra, and Hera with multiple blasters. They'd expected this, however, and while Kanan disarmed Galus, Sabine and Zeb planted explosives on Galus's cargo freighters. Galus had no choice but to give Hera the parts for the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"RR\">{{SWRMCite|1|Ring Race|''Ring Race''}}</ref>\n\n====The Stygeon trap====\n[[File:Phantom_and_fleet.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The rebel fighter ''Phantom'' and the \"fleet.\"]]\nLater, Hera and her fellow rebels received a transmission from the outspoken dissident Senator [[Gall Trayvis]] that the Galactic Empire had imprisoned the Jedi Master [[Luminara Unduli]] at the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]], a prison on remote [[Stygeon Prime]]. Despite the risks involved in breaching the fortified Imperial prison, the rebels decided to rescue the imprisoned Jedi so that she could assist Ezra's Jedi training. Upon arriving in the [[Stygeon system]], they left the ''Ghost'' behind in Chopper's hands while Hera flew the rest of the crew towards the prison on the ''[[Phantom]]'', the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary vessel. While Kanan, Ezra, Zeb, and Sabine infiltrated the prison complex, Hera remained aboard the ''Phantom'' to evacuate her comrades once they had freed Luminara.<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\">{{Rebels|Rise of the Old Masters}}</ref>\n\nUnknown to Hera and her comrades, Luminara had already died but the Empire had preserved her remains in order to lure surviving Jedi to their deaths. Upon reaching Luminara's cell at the lower levels of the complex, Kanan and Ezra were ambushed by [[the Grand Inquisitor]], a [[Force-sensitive|Force sensitive]] agent of the Empire tasked with hunting down Jedi Purge survivors. After a brief [[lightsaber duel]], Kanan and his Padawan managed to escape into the vast prison complex. Meanwhile, Hera was waiting aboard the ''Phantom'' when the ship's sensors detected something approaching the shuttle. At first, Hera thought that it was a TIE fighter. However, the intruder turned out to be a group of [[tibidee]]s, winged flying creatures native to the Spire, that mistook the ''Phantom''{{'s}} jamming signal for a mating call. Hera was forced to detach the shuttle from the side of the prison but was followed by the creatures. Through some unknown means, Hera managed to convince the tibidees that she was a friend and that the Imperials were the enemies.<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Kanan and Ezra managed to reunite with Sabine and Zeb. The four rebels then made their way to a [[Hangar|hangar bay]] while dodging the Inquisitor's twin-bladed lightsaber and the prison's automated blast doors. After unlocking the hangar bay's blast doors, the four rebels found themselves trapped by a force of stormtroopers and a blaster fight broke out. Hera and the ''Phantom'' returned in the midst of this skirmish with a large fleet of tibidees, which proceeded to attack the stormtroopers. Hera managed to evacuate her rebel comrades and they returned to the ''Ghost''. Despite their failure to rescue Luminara, Kanan's relationship with his Padawan Ezra improved as a result of their experiences in the Spire.<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\" />\n\n====Destroying a kyber crystal====\n[[File:Ghost_Destroys_Crystal.png|thumb|right|250px|Hera and Kanan fleeing the exploding kyber crystal.]]\nLater, Hera and Kanan sent Ezra on a mission to infiltrate the [[Academy for Young Imperials]] on Lothal to steal an Imperial [[decoder]] containing the location of a powerful [[Kyber crystal]]. Ezra infiltrated the Academy disguised as a [[Cadet]] named Dev Morgan. He was also assisted by Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb who remained outside the Academy's parameters to help Ezra evacuate once he had completed his mission. Meanwhile, Hera and Kanan remained aboard the ''Ghost'' while waiting for Sabine to transmit the coordinates of the Kyber crystal. With the assistance of a disillusion Imperial Cadet named [[Zare Leonis]], Ezra succeeded in stealing the decoder. As a result, Hera and Kanan learnt that the kyber crystal was being transported by a convoy consisting of three [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruisers]]. However, Ezra decided to delay his exit in order to protect another Cadet named [[Jai Kell]] from being abducted by the Inquisitor for [[Project Harvester]], a secret Imperial project to identify Force-sensitive individuals.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\">{{Rebels|Breaking Ranks}}</ref>\n\nDespite this unexpected development, Hera convinced Kanan to focus on their mission to destroy the kyber crystal. Using the decoder's coordinates, the ''Ghost'' intercepted the Imperial convoy. While Kanan used the ''Phantom'' to harry the convoy's TIE fighter escorts, Hera used the ''Ghost''{{'s}} weapons systems to attack the middle ''Gozanti'' cruiser; which Kanan had determined was ferrying the kyber crystal. Hera managed to destroy the cruiser before it could make a jump into hyperspace. This created a massive explosion which consumed the other cruisers and the TIE fighters. Hera and Kanan narrowly managed to escape into hyperspace and returned to Lothal. By that time, Ezra and Jai Kell had managed to escape from the Academy with the assistance of Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb. After reuniting with their comrades in Lothal's wilderness, Hera helped Jai and [[Jai Kell's mother|his mother]] to hide from the Empire.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\n====Mission to Fort Anaxes====\n[[File:Out_of_Darkness.png|thumb|left|250px|Hera Syndulla and Sabine Wren settling their differences on Fort Anaxes.]]\nLater, Hera along with Sabine and Ezra participated in a mission provided by [[Fulcrum]], Hera's secret contact and a key leader of the rebel network. During the course of their mission their shuttle, the ''Phantom'', was attacked by several TIE fighters. This narrow brush with death led Sabine to question Fulcrum's reliability and to ask Hera to reveal her source. Wanting to protect knowledge of the rebellion from the Empire, Hera refused to disclose this information to Sabine. Dissatisfied with Hera's response, Sabine insisted on accompanying her on their next supply run to [[Fort Anaxes]], an abandoned asteroid base used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Wanting to resolve this conflict peacefully, Hera obliged and the two women departed on the ''Phantom'' for Fort Anaxes.<ref name=\"OOD\">{{Rebels|Out of Darkness}}</ref>\n\nUnknown to the two women, Ezra and Zeb had failed to fix a leak in the ''Phantom''{{'s}} fuel line. This would have serious ramifications for Sabine and Hera. Unaware of this problem, Hera and Sabine departed in the ''Phantom''. During their journey, Sabine asked more probing questions which Hera tactfully dodged. However, Sabine was not fooled and persisted with her questioning. At that point, Fulcrum contacted Hera to inform her that their supplies had been unloaded and were waiting for them on Fort Anaxes. When Sabine attempted to talk to Fulcrum, Hera was forced to break off communications. Upon their arrival, they discovered that Fulcrum had already fled their rendezvous point. However, Hera found a small symbol left by Fulcrum on one of the supply crates which she promptly hid from Sabine.<ref name=\"OOD\" />\n\nAfter arriving at Fort Anaxes, Sabine asked Hera to confirm that she and Kanan trusted her. With the fight against the Empire escalating, Sabine explained that she needed to know more about Fulcrum in order to know that her struggle was not in vain. She recalled that during her time at the [[Imperial Academy]] on [[Mandalore]], she was a blind follower of the Empire but that it had ended up being a nightmare. Hera understood Sabine's concerns and assured the younger woman that she trusted her. However, she explained to Sabine that could not disclose all that she knew about the wider Rebellion to avoid that information falling into the hands of the Empire. Unlike Sabine, Hera knew that their cell was part of a wider rebel network. Finally, she asked Sabine to have faith in her and Kanan.<ref name=\"OOD\" />\n\nWhile they were loading the supplies onto the ''Phantom'', Hera and Sabine were attacked by a pack of [[fyrnock]]s, deadly silicon-based lifeforms that had driven the Republic personnel from the asteroid base. While attempting to flee, they discovered that the ''Phantom''{{'s}} fuel tank was faulty. Hera also contacted their crewmates on the ''Ghost'' for help. After discovering that the fyrnocks could not withstand sunlight, Hera and Sabine devised a plan to use [[rhydonium]] explosives to kill the creatures. However, they quickly ran out of explosives. When it seemed that they would be devoured by fyrnocks, the crew of the '' Ghost'' came and rescued them. Once safely aboard the ''Ghost'', Hera assured Sabine that she trusted her even more as a result of their adventure at Fort Anaxes. In return, Hera asked Sabine if she could trust her and promised the Mandalorian girl that she would eventually understand the cause they were fighting for. Sabine agreed and promised that she would try.<ref name=\"OOD\" />\n\n====Empire Day====\n[[File:Ezra_ignites_his_lightsaber.png|thumb|right|250px|Hera and the other crew watching Ezra and his new lightsaber.]]\nOn Empire Day, Hera Syndulla and her rebel companions visited a [[cantina]] in Lothal's Capital City. Around that time, the [[Rodian]] [[Tseebo]], who worked for the [[Imperial Information Office]] had gone missing and the Imperial authorities had launched a manhunt. Zeb was present at the cantina when three TIE fighter pilots visited the building and briefly accosted a Rodian customer, whom they later released after determining that he was not Tseebo. During the Empire Day celebrations that night, the ''Ghost''{{'s}} crew decided to destroy a new [[TIE Advanced v1]] prototype that was displayed to the Lothalian public. While Kanan planted a [[thermal detonator]] on the TIE's [[repulsorlift]] platform, Zeb and Sabine distracted the Imperials by lighting colorful fireworks.<ref name=\"Empire Day\">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the explosion, Hera left early to prepare the ''Ghost'' for take off and to pick them up at a rendezvous point. The Spectres succeeded in destroying the TIE prototype but the Imperials responded by imposing a citywide lockdown. With air travel prohibited, Hera was unable to bring the ''Ghost'' to their rendezvous point. Shortly later, she was joined by Zeb, who had managed to escape the lockdown. However, Kanan promised to transmit a new rendezvous point as soon as they had found one. The other rebels managed to escape the lockdown and also rescued Tseebo, who had been hiding in Ezra's former home. Hijacking an [[Imperial troop transport]], her rebel companions managed to break out of the security cordon and enter the highway but were pursued by Agent Kallus. Hera then flew the ''Ghost'' to their new rendezvous point and picked them up.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" />\n\nHera and her rebel comrades then fled into space but were pursued by several TIE fighters led by the Grand Inquisitor, who piloted his own TIE Advanced fighter. During a brief dogfight Chopper, who was manning the rear turret, was hit by laser fire; forcing Zeb to take over. Hera also ordered Sabine to man the ''Ghost''{{'s}} nose gun and Ezra to fix the ship's navicomputer. While Ezra was unable to repair the navicomputer, Tseebo succeeded in eliminating the problem by transmitting hyperspace coordinates directly to the ''Ghost''{{'s}} computer. Thus, the rebels were able to escape into hyperspace. However, the Inquisitor succeeded in planting an [[XX-23 S-thread tracker]] on the ''Phantom'', the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary ship.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}</ref>\n\nAfter escaping the Imperials, Hera and the other rebels held a meeting to discuss what to do with Tseebo. Ezra was resentful towards the Rodian for not saving his parents [[Mira Bridger|Mira]] and [[Ephraim Bridger]]. Tseebo then interrupted the meeting to announce that the Imperials were tracking the ''Ghost''. Under Hera's orders, Chopper scanned the Ghost and detected the tracker's on the hull of the ''Phantom''. When Hera suggested dumping the ''Phantom'' in hyperspace, Kanan responded that he and Ezra could use the shuttle as a decoy to keep the Imperials from their true target: Tseebo. While Kanan and Ezra kept the Inquisitor busy, Hera would arrange a rendezvous with the mysterious rebel agent known as Fulcrum, who would then arrange Tseebo's welfare. After agreeing to this plan, the rebels parted company.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\nWhile Kanan and Ezra grappled with the Inquisitor on the asteroid Fort Anaxes, Hera and the other ''Ghost'' crew arrived at their rendezvous point with Fulcrum's [[Ahsoka Tano's corvette|corvette]] in deep space. Prior to boarding the blockade runner, Tseebo confided in Hera that he had failed Ezra's parents and told her that he had volunteered for a cybernetic implant in order to make up for the wrong he had done. He also told Hera that he knew the fate of Ezra's parents. Before Tseebo left, Hera agreed to share this information with Ezra when he was ready. Later, the Spectres were rejoined by Kanan and Ezra, who had escaped from the Inquisitor on Fort Anaxes. However, Ezra was troubled after inadvertently tapping into the [[Dark side of the Force|Dark Side]] during his confrontation with the Inquisitor.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\nFollowing Ezra's confrontation with the Inquisitor, Hera supported Kanan when he decided to take the young Padawan for his [[Jedi Trials]] at the [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] on Lothal. She encouraged her lover by telling him that he had to help Ezra following the events at Fort Anaxes. Following Ezra's successful Jedi Trials, Hera and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' were present when he presented his new [[Ezra Bridger's lightsaber|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\">{{Rebels|Path of the Jedi}}</ref>\n\n====Calrissian's job====\n[[File:Idiots_Array_thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Hera working with Calrissian]]\nAfter Zeb and Kanan lost Chopper in a game of [[sabacc]] with the entrepreneur [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], Hera took on a job from the man in order to reclaim her droid. She was also incensed towards Zeb and Kanan for gambling on Chopper. Lando attempted to ingratiate himself with the crew members one at a time while simultaneously turning them against one another, a tactic Hera quickly took notice of.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>\n\nWhen they rendezvoused with Lando's contact the crime lord [[Azmorigan]], Hera went aboard with Lando and Kanan. Lando subtly informed Hera of his plan without actually giving her instructions. To everyone's shock Lando offered Hera as payment to the gangster Azmorigan in exchange for his mysterious piece of cargo. Hera chose to play along with Lando's ruse despite the imminent danger it put her in. Using her natural allure she knocked out Azmorigan and one of his guards using a food tray, which she wryly referred to as very useful. Using the escape pod Lando mentioned she managed to escape back to the Ghost. Upon arriving back on the ''Ghost'', she punched Lando in the stomach and reprimanded him for endangering her and her crew. However, she continued his job nonetheless.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\nDespite Lando's instructions, Ezra and Zeb opened the box containing the mysterious piece of cargo, which turned out to be a [[puffer pig]]. The frightened animal wreaked havoc aboard the ''Ghost'' and prevented Hera from returning to the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cockpit by inflating itself and blocking the passage. Using the ''Ghost''{{'s}} signature modulation, Kanan piloted the ship past the Imperial blockade on Lothal and managed to evade several pursuing TIE fighters. After breaking past the Imperials, Hera reprimanded Lando for his divide and conquer tactics and asserted herself as the commander of the crew, instructing Lando to follow her command. Calrissian also revealed that his plan was to use the puffer pig for mining; the Empire had banned private entrepreneurs from owning the animal in order to maintain a monopoly on mining.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\nAfter escaping the Imperial blockade, Hera along with her crew and Calrissian made their way to [[Lando Calrissian's farm]]. There, they were confronted by Azmorigan, who had been angered by Calrissian's theft of his puffer pig and had come to exact revenge on the shady entrepreneur. Hera and her crew became caught up in a shootout between the rebels and Azmorigan. During the fighting, Azmorigan took Zeb hostage and threatened to kill the Lasat if they did not hand Lando over to him. However, Chopper resolved the situation by firing on Azmorigan, allowing Hera and the rebels to regain the upper hand. Hera then demanded that the defeated crime lord leave, a demand that he acquiesced to. With Azmorigan gone, Calrissian returned Chopper to Hera. Since Calrissian did not have the credits to repay them for their \"job,\" Chopper with the approval of Hera and the other crew, stole Calrissian's fuel canisters; which the entrepreneur conceded as fair payment for their risky mission.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\n====Exposing Trayvis====\nFollowing the latest transmission from Gall Trayvis, the crew attempted to meet with him personally, after Hera and Ezra managed to decode the senator's hidden message. After sneaking into the senate building and meeting Trayvis they were immediately ambushed by Agent Kallus and his men. Trayvis suggested they surrender, but they managed to escape capture with Sabine's aid. The crew fled into the sewers with Kallus in pursuit, but the senator's curious behavior began to arouse Hera's suspicions. Trayvis lagged behind and began asking her for information on their group and their activities. While Hera had long been inspired by the broadcasts of Trayvis as a voice of resistance against the Empire, she quickly realized the senator was not what he appeared.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\">{{Rebels|Vision of Hope}}</ref>\n\nSuspicious that his ineptitude during the escape was in fact an attempt to get them captured, she gave him her blaster and requested cover while she and Ezra deactivate a large industrial fan, blocking their exit. Her theory proved correct as the deceitful Trayvis attempted to prevent them from escaping by holding them at blaster point. Hera turned his tactics against him and coaxed him into revealing his own secrets as an Imperial agent. Fortunately Hera had given Trayvis an uncharged blaster, allowing her to punch him unconscious and escape with the crew. Disheartened by the revelation of the senator's deceit, Ezra expressed his concerns to Hera. She reassured him that things would get better as long as they had hope.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\" />\n\n====Confronting Tarkin====\n[[File:Hera_Fulcrum_Hologram.png|thumb|right|250px|Hera conferencing with Fulcrum.]]\nThe Spectres' activities eventually attracted the attention of [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], who decided to implement a final solution to the rebel problem there. Unhappy that Imperial propaganda was casting them in a negative light, Hera and her rebel comrades participated in a mission to hijack the Imperial communications tower on Lothal. While her rebel comrades assaulted the compound, Hera remained aboard the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary ship, the ''Phantom'', to evacuate the team after they finished inserting a data spike onto the communication tower's main computer. However, Tarkin along with Agent Kallus and the Inquisitor had planned to trap the rebels and quickly surrounded the complex. Following a brief struggle, the Imperials succeeded in capturing Kanan.<ref name=\"Call to Action\">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref>\n\nHera was unwilling to abandon Kanan but she reluctantly complied and escaped with the other rebels. Despite losing Kanan to the Empire, Ezra succeeded in making a heartfelt broadcast that was heard by many on Lothal and the neighboring system. In response, Tarkin ordered his [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|patrol transports]] to destroy the Imperial communications tower, which disrupted communications throughout Lothal. Following Kanan's capture, Hera reassured Ezra that their efforts had not been for nothing. She also assured her fellow rebels that their fight against the Empire was not over yet.<ref name=\"Call to Action\" />\n\n====Mission to Mustafar====\n[[File:Lothal_rebels_TIE.png|thumb|left|250px|Hera and her crew pose with their stolen TIE fighter.]]\nFollowing Kanan's capture by the Empire, Hera received orders from Fulcrum not to rescue Kanan and take her crew into hiding. She reluctantly complied but later changed her mind after Ezra and his companions disobeyed her orders. Using the lead that Ezra had obtained from the Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizago, they learned that the Empire had begun using [[R4 courier droid|courier droids]] to deliver data in the wake of the communication tower's destruction. To ascertain Kanan's whereabouts, Sabine Wren disguised Chopper as an Imperial courier droid. Then, the disguised droid boarded an [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|Imperial communications cruiser]] in orbit and then transmitted the coordinates to Hera. After completing his work, he contacted Hera who brought the ''Ghost'' into space and attacked the cruiser, buying enough time for Chopper to return to the ''Ghost''. After returning to Lothal, Hera and the other rebels learnt that Kanan was being transported to the [[Mustafar system]], which Kanan had earlier described as a place where Jedi went to die.<ref name=\"Rebel Resolve\">{{Rebels|Rebel Resolve}}</ref>\n\nLater, Ezra and Zeb revealed to Hera and Sabine that the TIE fighter they had stolen had not been destroyed but was in fact hidden. Hera then decided to use the TIE fighter to [[Action at Mustafar|infiltrate]] Tarkin's Star Destroyer, the ''[[Sovereign]]'', and rescue Kanan. The rebels then traveled to [[Mustafar]] in a stolen Imperial freighter. When approaching the Imperial fleet, Hera asked Ezra if Kanan was alive. Seeing through the Force, Ezra told her that he could sense Kanan's presence aboard the ''Sovereign''. Under the pretext of delivering a TIE fighter, Sabine flew the stolen starfighter, which she had repainted, into the ''Sovereign''{{'s}} hangar bay. Sabine then used several inbuilt EMP devices to knock out the ship's power and stormtroopers.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\nHera and her rebel companions with the exception of Chopper then boarded the Star Destroyer; Chopper stayed behind to look after their stolen Imperial freighter. While Ezra went to find Kanan, Hera along with Sabine and Zeb fought the ship's stormtroopers. After learning from Ezra that Kanan had escaped and defeated the Inquisitor, the rebels fled the ship. The ''Sovereign''{{'s}} reactor core had been damaged during a duel between Kanan and the Inquisitor; forcing Grand Moff Tarkin to order a general evacuation of the Star Destroyer. Hera and her rebel comrades escaped in two stolen TIE fighters but were pursued by a swarm of TIE fighters. Fortunately for Hera, the rebels were rescued by a fleet of rebel starships, which included the ''Ghost'', Chopper's stolen freighter, and two [[CR90 corvette|blockade runners]]. After linking up with Chopper's freighter, the rebels escaped into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\nUpon boarding Chopper's stolen Imperial freighter, they were greeted by two rebel soldiers and a [[hologram]] projection of Senator Organa, the man who had earlier rewarded them for destroying the T-7 ion rifles. After the Senator introduced himself, Hera revealed to her rebel comrades that their cell group had been part of a wider rebel network that was dedicated to overthrowing the Galactic Empire. Shortly later, they were joined by the enigmatic Fulcrum, who revealed herself as Ahsoka Tano, an ex-Jedi Padawan who had survived [[Order 66]]. In response to the rebels' successes, the Emperor sent his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] Darth Vader to deal with them.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\n===The rebellion===\n====Rescuing a defector====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Hera_rebellion_talk.png|thumb|right|250px|Hera and Kanan discussing their differences.]]\nFollowing the events in the Mustafar system, Hera and the crew of the ''Ghost'' learned that they were part of a larger rebellion against the Galactic Empire, with Hera receiving an Alliance officer's commission, and being designated as [[Spectre Leader]].<ref name=\"Rebel Files\">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref> Hera and her crewmates joined the [[Phoenix Cell]] fleet and took part in a [[Mission to steal Imperial shield generators|mission to steal]] [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]] from the Empire to help defend the fleet. During the mission, Hera flew the ''Ghost'' in support of [[Phoenix Squadron]], a squadron of [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wings]], and a fleet of rebel blockade runners led by Commander [[Jun Sato]]. The fleet attacked a group of Imperial [[freighter]]s and knocked supplies loose from one of the vessels. After the ''Ghost'' secured the cargo, Hera and the rest of the fleet fled into hyperspace. While the rebels failed to capture shield generators, they succeeded in securing more fuel supplies.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nLater, Hera was present on the bridge of the rebel command ship ''[[Phoenix Home]]'' when Chopper received a holographic transmission from the disillusioned Imperial Minister Tua, who wanted to defect from the Empire in exchange for providing vital Imperial intelligence. Against fleet protocol, Kanan had ordered Chopper to play the message. In response, Hera instructed the astromech droid to mask their signal by only using one-way visual communication. After some discussion, Hera and her rebel colleagues agreed to rescue Minister Tua. Following their meeting, Hera confronted Kanan and scolded him for breaching fleet protocol. When Kanan expressed his discomfort about the rebels being involved in a military operation, Hera reminded the Jedi that they were part of a larger struggle against the Empire. However, Kanan was reluctant to join the rebellion due to his traumatic experience with the Clone Wars and the Jedi Purge.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nFor the mission, the rebels traveled to Lothal in a Star Commuter 2000 shuttle. After further discussions and passing through the Imperial blockade above Lothal, Hera and the other crew headed to their pre-arranged rendezvous point while Chopper and Zeb stayed aboard the shuttle. As part of the plan, the rebels would rescue Minister Tua while she was boarding a shuttle for a scheduled meeting with Grand Moff Tarkin. During the rescue operation, Hera along with Ezra and Sabine Wren attacked Tua's Imperial escorts from the rooftop while Kanan infiltrated the Imperial escorts disguised as a [[Stormtrooper Commander]]. However, Agent Kallus had learned about Minister Tua's planned defection and had set a trap for the rebels. Tua was killed during a shuttle explosion that was subsequently blamed on the rebels. With their plan in tatters, Hera and her rebel comrades were forced to flee into hiding.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\n====Escaping the Siege====\n[[File:Imperial_shuttle_explodes.png|thumb|left|250px|Syndulla tried to help Minister Tua, but she was killed in a shuttle explosion.]]\nFleeing from Imperial forces, Hera and her fellow rebels boarded the Star Commuter 2000 after Chopper and Orrelios arrived. However, the shuttle was shot down by an AT-DP walker and the rebels were forced to flee to Ezra Bridger's former home, which served as one of their safe houses. However, they were pursued by stormtroopers. Deducing that the forces in the Imperial complex would be stretched thin since the garrison was hunting for them, the rebels hatched a plan to sneak in and steal a shuttle in order to escape Lothal. While Kanan retained his stormtrooper disguise and Bridger impersonated an Imperial cadet, Hera, and the other rebels hid in several crates. This ruse allowed them to infiltrate the Imperial complex where they managed to steal several Imperial shield generators. Before they could make their escape, Hera and her rebel comrades were confronted by the [[Sith Lord]] Darth Vader. The Sith Lord proved more than a match for Kanan and Ezra with the rebels barely managing to escape the complex in a stolen shuttle.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nKnowing that Darth Vader had imposed a blockade around Lothal, the rebels decided they had to smuggle themselves off Lothal. Hera suggested turning to their old friend, Lando Calrissian for help. Hera and Kanan contacted Calrissian who was offworld at the time. Calrissian reluctantly agreed to assist their escape in return for the rebels giving him three of their stolen shield generators. Following the events on Lothal and the destruction of Tarkintown, Hera and her comrades decided not to return to the plant in order to avoid endangering the planet's people. With the help of Calrissian's droid [[W1-LE]], Sabine created sensor buoys that could replicate the signal of the shuttle and throw of the Imperial forces hunting for them. This ploy allowed the ''Ghost'' crew to evade the Imperial blockade. Unbeknownst to Hera and the rebels, Darth Vader had planted a tracking device on the shuttle in order to track the rebels to his true objective: the Phoenix rebel fleet.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nWhile traveling back to the Phoenix rebel fleet, the rebels voted to continue fighting alongside Phoenix Squadron. Shortly after arriving back at the fleet, the Phoenix rebels were attacked by a lone [[TIE Advanced x1]] starfighter piloted by Darth Vader, the Sith Lord they had encountered on Lothal. During the space battle, Vader inflicted significant damage on the fleet's A-wing starfighters and the rebel flagship ''Phoenix Home'', which had to be abandoned. Hera and her crew flew the ''Ghost'' during the fighting but were forced to retreat with the arrival of Imperial Star Destroyers. Towards the end of the space battle, Hera devised a plan to trap Darth Vader's TIE fighter by flying the ''Ghost'' between two Star Destroyers and tricking them into activating their [[tractor beam projector]]s. This plan worked and the ''Ghost'' managed to jump into hyperspace; leaving Vader's starfighter behind to be trapped in their place.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" />\n\n====Mission to Seelos====\nFollowing the destruction of ''Phoenix Home'', Hera and her fellow rebels were again on the run from the Empire. At the suggestion of Ahsoka Tano, she and other the crew of the ''Ghost'' traveled to the planet [[Seelos]] to seek out one of her old friends: the former clone trooper [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Rex]]. While Ezra, Kanan, Sabine, and Zeb traveled down to Seelos' surface on the ''Phantom'', Hera and Chopper stayed behind to repair the ''Ghost''. The other Spectres succeeded in making contact with Rex and his two comrades [[Wolffe]] and [[Gregor]].<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GhostCrew-RotOR.png|thumb|right|250px|Syndulla helped in recruiting Rex for the rebel cause.]]\nAfter some difficulty, they succeeded in winning over Rex and Gregor. Hera's comrades on Seelos were mollified to learn that the three clone veterans had removed their [[brain]] [[Behavioral modification biochip|chips]], which allowed them to ignore the order to carry out the Jedi Purge. When Kanan contacted Hera to confide his mistrust of the clones, Hera counseled him to remember that not all Clones were bad and reiterated that they had saved millions of lives including her own. However, Wolffe, who believed the rebels were a threat, sent a coded transmission to the Empire.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" />\n\nThis transmission was picked up by [[Admiral]] [[Kassius Konstantine]] and Agent Kallus, the latter a perennial foe of the rebel band.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" /> Hera and Chopper were aboard the ''Ghost'' when Konstantine's Star Destroyer ''[[Relentless]]'' exited hyperspace above Seelos. In response, Hera and Chopper turned off all systems aboard the ''Ghost'' to avoid detection. Meanwhile, the other Spectres and the three Clone veterans succeeded in defeating a force of [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] led by Agent Kallus and escaping offworld. Thus, the rebels succeeded in recruiting the Clone troopers for the rebel cause.<ref name=\"Relics of the Old Republic\">{{Rebels|Relics of the Old Republic}}</ref>\n\n====Double trouble====\nUsing the intelligence provided by Rex, Hera discovered that there was an abandoned Old Republic medical station in space. She sent Sabine, Chopper, and Zeb on a mission to retrieve these medical supplies for the rebellion. Unknown to Hera, Ezra, who was unhappy with a recent levitation lesson, followed the other rebels. The younger rebels traveled on the ''Phantom'' to the space station where they were trapped by two more [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] known as the [[Seventh Sister]] and the [[Fifth Brother]]. Following a [[Skirmish aboard a Republic medical station|skirmish]], Zeb managed to rescue his three comrades and return to the rebel fleet on the ''Phantom''. Hera along with Rex and Kanan were present when the four rebels brought back news that the Empire had more Inquisitors.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>\n\n====Finding power cells====\nLater, Hera and her rebel companions participated in a mission to find a new supply of power cells to help the people of the frigid planet of [[Rinn]], who was experiencing an energy crisis. While Hera and the other ''Ghost'' crew left to look for power cells on Garel, she ordered Ezra and Chopper to clean the ''Ghost''. In the midst of Hera's absence, Ezra and Chopper embarked on a mission to rescue the Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizago, whose ship the ''[[Broken Horn]]'' had been hijacked by the pirate [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. During the mission, Ezra and Chopper managed to obtain five power generators which the rebels used to aid the people of Rinn.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\">{{Rebels|Brothers of the Broken Horn}}</ref>\n\n====The Blade Wing====\nFollowing the encounter with Hondo, Hera and Phoenix Group took part in a mission to deliver relief supplies to the planet [[Ibaar]], which was facing starvation due to an Imperial [[Blockade of Ibaar|blockade]] around the planet. The rebels tried to break through the blockade but were repelled by Agent Kallus' fleet. The Phoenix rebels sustained considerable casualties including the loss of their transport ship and [[Phoenix Leader (Ibaar)|Phoenix Leader]]. Defeated, Hera and her rebel comrades were forced to retreat into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" />\n\nAfter returning to the Phoenix fleet, the rebels discussed a new strategy to get supplies through the Imperial blockade. During the meeting, Captain Rex suggested that the rebels get in contact with a [[Mon Calamari]] engineer named [[Quarrie]], who was developing a prototype heavy assault starfighter. However, Rex mentioned that Quarrie would only discuss his ship in person on the planet [[Shantipole]], which had a reputation for being a death-trap where few starships returned. After most of the Phoenix pilots declined to participate in that mission, Kanan convinced a reluctant Hera to take on that assignment. While Hera believed that her place was with the Phoenix fleet, she reluctantly agreed to take up the mission after Kanan pointed out that the Phoenix fleet's starships could not break through the blockade.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" />\n\n[[File:Rebels_see_Blade_Wing.png|thumb|left|250px|Syndulla was tasked to get the developing prototype heavy assault starfighter.]]\nHera and the crew of the ''Ghost'' traveled to Shantipole. While Hera, Zeb, and Sabine traveled down to the planet in the ''Phantom'', Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper traveled on the ''Ghost'' to rendezvous with a supply ship in preparation for a second attempt to break the Imperial blockade of Ibaar. While traveling through Shantipole's atmosphere, the ''Phantom'' was struck by a bolt of lightning which damaged its starship systems. With much difficulty, Hera managed to fly the crippled ''Phantom'' to a landing field where Quarrie was said to live. Despite the electrical damage, Hera managed to land the ''Phantom'' in one piece. Shortly later, they were greeted and welcomed by Quarrie, who invited Hera to test his prototype [[Prototype B6|Blade Wing]] starfighter. When Hera offered to go for a spin in the Blade Wing, Quarrie declined but offered to help them repair the ''Phantom''.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" />\n\nWhile Quarrie was making repairs to the ''Phantom'', Hera took the opportunity to ask Quarrie why he was unable to transmit the plans for his ship to Rex. In response, Quarrie replied that he would not hand over his ship to any pilot and then asked Hera why she had risked her life to come to Shantipole. Hera then recounted how she had developed a love for flying during her childhood when she witnessed Republic ships liberating her world. Syndulla's passion for flying had led her to leave her family and later to join the Rebellion. Hera also mentioned how she felt at peace when flying even in the middle of a conflict. Touched by her words, Quarrie allowed Hera to fly the Blade Wing.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" />\n\nWith Quarrie's permission, Hera took the prototype Blade Wing on its maiden flight. Despite its engines cutting off initially during a dive, Hera managed to regain control of the starfighter and flew through a nearby canyon without any further problems. After passing Sabine, Zeb, and Quarrie on one run, Hera began testing the Blade Wing's weaponry on a wrecked starship. Under Quarrie's instruction, Hera toyed with the starfighter's multi-cannon system and used it to destroy the wrecked ship with one fiery blast. Having completed its maiden flight, Syndulla taxied back on the runway. Hera's successful test flight coincided with a transmission from Kanan informing her and her companions that the rebels were preparing to launch a second run on the Imperial blockade at Ibaar.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" />\n\n[[File:Blade_Wing_fires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Syndulla tested the B6 prototype on the Blockade on Ibaar]]\nHowever, Hera and her companions faced an unexpected problem when Sabine discovered that the multi-cannon's firing system had drained the Blade Wing's hyperdrive. There was not enough time for Quarrie and the rebels to address the ship's problem. Fortunately for Hera, she learned that Quarrie had upgraded the ''Phantom''{{'s}} hyperdrive system. Using this knowledge, Hera had the Blade Wing attached to the ''Phantom''. Hera, Sabine, Zeb, and Quarrie then traveled to Ibaar on the ''Phantom''. Upon exiting hyperspace, the Blade Wind detached from the ''Phantom''. Their arrival was timely because the Phoenix fleet was about to launch its second run against the Imperial blockade. The ''Ghost'' had been designated as the new transport vessel.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" />\n\nThe Phoenix fleet allowed Hera and Sabine to fly the Blade Wing starfighter ahead. Using the starfighter's multi-cannon system, they destroyed one of Kallus' ''Arquitens''-class light cruisers. This allowed Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper to break through the Imperial blockade with the ''Ghost'' and deliver the much-needed relief supplies to the people of Ibaar. Following their successful mission, Commander Sato credited Quarrie's Blade Wing starfighter with breaking the Imperial blockade and informed the rebels that Senator Organa was willing to manufacture more B-wings in secret. Quarrie agreed to supervise the manufacture of the rebellion's Blade Wings and also praised Hera for her recent victory. At the recommendation of Kanan, Commander Sato promoted Hera to the position of Phoenix Leader and was promoted to Commander.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" /><ref name=\"Rebel Files\" />\n\n====Phoenix Leader====\nAs [[Phoenix Leader]], Hera's responsibilities and standing in the rebellion increased. On the planet Garel, she sent two pilots to pick up fighter parts in [[Garel City]]'s market place. Shortly later, she sent Sabine, Chopper, and Ezra on a mission to pick up a courier at [[Garel City Spaceport]] and transport him to [[Havoc Outpost]]. While Hera did not know what the courier looked like, she told Sabine and her companions that he would answer to the code-phrase: \"It's a long way to [[Alderaan]].\" Hera placed Sabine in charge of this mission and made Chopper and Ezra her back-ups. The courier turned out to be a [[GNK-series power droid]] named [[EG-86]].<ref name=\"Blood Sisters\">{{Rebels|Blood Sisters}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hera_talks_to_Ketsu_and_Sabine.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Syndulla responsibilities increased.]]\nSabine's mission was complicated by the arrival of her estranged former friend [[Ketsu Onyo]] and a stormtrooper patrol. During the fighting in the spaceport, Ezra was separated from his team but managed to return to Hera. Meanwhile, Sabine and Chopper completed the mission with Ketsu's assistance. Hera was present when Sabine and Ketsu returned from their mission. After congratulating Sabine, she also thanked Ketsu for her help.<ref name=\"Blood Sisters\" />\n\nLater, Phoenix Leader Hera and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' received a distress transmission from [[Commander]] Sato, whose CR90 corvette [[Liberator (CR90 corvette)|''Liberator'']] had been pulled out of hyperspace and captured by an [[Interdictor vessel|Imperial Interdictor]], a prototype warship equipped with [[gravity well projector]]s. Ezra had also been captured since he had an accompanied Sato, who had traveled to the [[Del Zennis system]] to investigate a lost patrol. When Kanan told the crew of the ''Ghost'' to gear up for a rescue mission, Hera countermanded his order and ordered Kanan to go with Rex and Chopper to rescue their rebel comrades.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref>\n\nDisguised as stormtroopers, Kanan and Rex managed to infiltrate the Imperial Interdictor and rescue Ezra, Sato, and his men. Chopper also managed to sabotage the Imperial Interdictor's gravity well projectors; causing two Imperial light cruisers to collide with it and destroying all three vessels. By working together, Kanan overcame his animosity towards Rex and developed a friendlier relationship.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\n====Escaping Garel====\n[[File:Ghost_knocks_out_tractor_beam.png|thumb|right|250px|Syndulla and the crew escaped from the ambush on Garel.]]\nUnder the leadership of Commander Sato and Phoenix Leader Hera, the Phoenix Squadron established a presence on the planet Garel. However, Garel was only intended as a temporary measure since the rebels did not want to endanger its inhabitants. While discussing plans with Kanan to establish a permanent base for the rebellion, Hera and Kanan were interrupted by Ezra Bridger, who had experienced a [[Force vision]] of his parents Ephraim and Mira Bridger. In response, Hera and Kanan decided that it was time to share what Tseebo had told her about the fate of Bridger's parents. The Bridgers had been imprisoned within a vast network of Imperial prisons that spanned the entire [[galaxy]]. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to determine which prison Ezra's parents had been sent to.<ref name=\"Legacy\">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>\n\nLater that morning, Hera received word from Commander Sato that there had been a break-out from an Imperial prison on Lothal the previous night. Hera was present when Kanan instructed Ezra to use the Force to focus on a list of the Lothalian prisoners. Ezra selected Prisoner X-10, a man whom they later discovered was [[Ryder Azadi]], the former Governor of Lothal. Shortly later, Sabine informed Hera and the other rebels that an Imperial fleet had just departed Lothal. Ezra viewed this as a sign that he was predestined to go to Lothal and convinced Hera and the other rebels to make preparations to depart from Garel City. Shortly later, the rebels were attacked by the Imperial fleet.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nAfter escaping stormtroopers, Hera and her rebel companions departed on the ''Ghost'' for space but were blocked by a fleet of Star Destroyers. While airborne, Ezra departed with Kanan and Chopper on the ''Phantom'' to continue his mission to find his parents. Meanwhile, Hera and Sabine manned the helm of the ''Ghost'' while Zeb manned the ship's rear turret cannon. After Commander Sato's [[command ship]] ''Liberator'' was trapped by the tractor beam projector of the Star Destroyer ''Relentless'', Hera used the ''Ghost'' to knock out the projector. Despite the ship's laser cannons being jammed, Hera managed to ram into the projector; freeing Commander Sato's ship. Hera and the surviving Phoenix rebels then fled into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n====Rendezvous on Lothal====\nFollowing the escape from Garel, Hera along with Zeb and Sabine traveled to Lothal to rendezvous with [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], the daughter of the [[Alderaanian]] Senator Organa, who was secretly supporting the rebellion. While chatting via hologram with Kanan, she informed him that Senator Organa had sent his daughter to supply three [[Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette|''Sphyrna''-class Hammerhead corvettes]] to the rebels. Since the Alderaanians could not be seen directly supporting the rebels, Bail and Leia had arranged for the rebels to steal the ships on Lothal, an Imperial world. Kanan in return informed her about their meeting with Azadi]], who had informed Ezra about the fate of his parents. The crew of the ''Ghost'' arrived on Lothal in the midst of a skirmish between Kanan, Ezra, Chopper, Leia, and Imperial forces, who had attempted to arrest Chopper and Ryder.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Leia_and_the_Ghost_crew.png|thumb|left|250px|Syndulla and the crew work alongside Princess Leia Organa.]]\nWhile Hera manned the controls of the ''Ghost'', Zeb and Sabine brought the other rebels aboard. To perpetuate the ruse that Leia was a loyal Imperial citizen, the rebels pretended to kidnap her and Kanan and Ezra, the latter wearing Imperial uniforms. After escaping back aboard the ''Ghost'', Hera and his fellow rebels learned about the passing of Ezra's parents and offered the youth their condolences. They then moved on to discuss their plans to \"steal\" Leia's three Hammerhead corvettes. Since Leia's ships were \"stolen\" by rebel elements frequently, the local Imperial official [[Supply Master]] [[Yogar Lyste]] had fitted the three corvettes with [[gravity lock]]s to deter futures thefts. Using Azadi's expertise with gravity locks, the rebels hatched a plan to \"steal\" the ships.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nIn order to infiltrate the Imperial depot, Kanan and Ezra posed as Imperial personnel who pretended to have rescued Leia from the rebels. While the Imperials were distracted, the crew of the ''Ghost'' and Ryder Azadi disabled the gravity locks and stole the starships. During the [[Mission on Lothal|raid]] on the Imperial depot, Hera and Zeb manned the ''Ghost'' and harried the depot's two [[All Terrain Armored Transport (original)|AT-AT walkers]]. The acquisition of the three Hammerhead corvettes supplemented the Phoenix Squadron's depleted forces. After completing their mission, Hera and her comrades rejoined the Phoenix fleet in space.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\n====Injured over Concord Dawn====\n[[File:Injured_Hera.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hera converses with Sabine and Kanan after waking from her coma.]]\nWith the Empire bearing down on their usual [[hyperspace route]]s, Sabine suggested the rebels try to use a route through the Mandalorian colony [[Concord Dawn]]. Hera and Sabine flew with Phoenix Squadron to the planet, where they were greeted by the [[Mandalorian Protectors|Mandalorian Protector]] leader [[Fenn Rau]]. On learning they were rebels, Rau, who was employed by the Empire, opened [[Dogfight over Concord Dawn|fire]]. Hera was injured while providing covering fire for the squadron to escape and just managed to make the jump to hyperspace to reunite with the fleet as [[Hera's A-wing|her fighter]] detonated around her. Sabine swore revenge, but Kanan refused, believing he could negotiate with Rau, having known him during the Clone Wars. The two [[Mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|confronted]] Rau, and at Kanan's behest, Sabine spared his life. After Rau reluctantly allowed the rebels passage, Hera came out of her coma and praised Sabine for making the right decision, quipping she behaved more like a Jedi than a Mandalorian. Sabine responded she'd been raised right.<ref>{{Rebels|The Protector of Concord Dawn}}</ref>\n\n====Voyage to Lira San====\nHera and her crew traveled on the ''Ghost'' to [[Nixus Hub 218]], a spaceport on the icy planet of [[Nixus]]. Ezra had received a tip from his one-time \"business partner\" Hondo Ohnaka about the arrival of two [[refugee]]s at Hub 218. After landing, Hera praised Ezra for taking the lead on this mission. When they approached the cargo section, they discovered Imperial stormtroopers arresting two Lasat refugees, who had been hiding in a [[cargo container]]. Hera watched while her rebel companions assaulted the Imperials and freed the Lasat captives. Shortly later, Hondo turned up and revealed that he was Ezra's mysterious source.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\">{{Rebels|Legends of the Lasat}}</ref>\n\nThe Lasat identified themselves as the former [[Lasan High Honor Guard]]sman [[Gron]] and the mystic [[Chava|Chava the Wise]]. From Gron, Hera and the other rebels learned that Zeb had once been a captain in the Honor Guard. As the rebels made their way back to the ''Ghost'', Chava told them that she and her companion were searching for the legendary Lasat planet of [[Lira San]], which was rumored to be a safe refuge for the Lasat species. The rebels were pursued by more stormtroopers but they managed to escape back to the ''Ghost'' with the help of Hondo, who sealed several exits to prevent the Imperials from pursuing them. During the gunfight, Hera exchanged fire and managed to shoot down several stormtroopers with her blaster.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\n[[File:Fight_in_Nixus_Hub_218.png|thumb|left|250px|Hera and Kanan exchanging fire with stormtroopers on Nixus.]]\nAfter boarding the ''Ghost'', Hera and her crew fled into hyperspace. Hera and her co-pilot Sabine piloted the ''Ghost'' during the ship's journey. Hera offered maps to help Chava and Gron find Lira San but Chava revealed that the planet did not exist on any official star charts. Instead, Chava and Gron began a ritual to help them find Lira San. Chava also discussed an ancient Lasat [[Prophecy of the Three|prophecy]] which stated that Lira San would only be found if the \"child\" saved both the \"warrior\" and the \"fool.\" While initially reluctant, Zeb agreed to take part in order to save his people. Later, Hera and the other rebels were present when Zeb used his [[bo-rifle]] to pinpoint Lira San's location on a holographic map generated by Chopper. After determining Lira San's location, Hera set a course for [[Wild Space]], a region that lay beyond the [[Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nAs the ''Ghost'' approached Wild Space, Hera was forced to pull the ship out of hyperspace when its sensors picked up a new obstacle: an imploded [[star cluster]] that blocked their path to Lira San. The rebels' problems were further compounded when an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] captained by Agent Kallus exited hyperspace behind them. Hera and Sabine manned the ''Ghost''{{'s}} controls as the ship attempted to brave the maelstrom ahead. At that point, Zeb fulfilled the ancient Lasat prophecy by using his bo-rifle to guide the ''Ghost'' through the maelstrom ahead. Hera and Sabine were initially taken by surprise but were relieved when their ship entered the gravitational field intact. Meanwhile, the Imperial cruiser was forced to retreat due to damage from the gravitational pull of the star cluster.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nUpon entering the imploded star cluster, the ''Ghost'' jumped into hyperspace. Hera and her crew were knocked out by a bright blast of light. When they awoke, they found themselves in an unknown region of space. Shortly later, they sighted Lira San on the horizon. Hera and the other rebels stayed aboard while Zeb along with Gron and Chava traveled down to Lira San in the ''Phantom''. The three Lasat subsequently discovered that Lira San was the original homeworld of the Lasat species and that it was home to millions of Lasat. While Gron and Chava elected to settle on Lira San, Zeb returned to rejoin the crew of the ''Ghost''. When Hera told Chopper that he had to put all of Zeb's things back in his room, the astromech droid groaned but complied. Having accomplished their mission, Hera and her crew returned to the known galaxy via the safe route which Zeb had discovered through the maelstrom.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\n====Joining forces with the purrgil====\nWith the ''Ghost'' low on fuel and power, Captain Syndulla traveled to a [[Mining Guild]] [[Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery]] to obtain fuel for her ship and the fleet. Hera and her co-pilot Sabine were piloting the ''Ghost'' when Ezra heard shrill cries in the distance. These cries came from the purrgil, large space-dwelling creatures that were capable of hyperspace travel. Fearful of the purrgil herd, Hera wanted to fire on the space creatures but Kanan managed to talk her out of it. Ezra then advised Hera to fly the ''Ghost'' in the same direction as the purrgil in an effort to calm them.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nThis tactic worked and the purrgil calmed down. When Ezra sensed that the purrgil were trying to communicate with them, Hera expressed skepticism and dismissed the purrgil as \"big, lumbering menaces\" that imperiled hyperspace travel. When the purrgil began showing signs of being startled, Zeb suggested that Hera was troubling them. However, the crew of the ''Ghost'' quickly discovered the real source of the disturbance when two [[TIE/mg Mining Guild starfighter]]s attacked the purrgil. Despite her dislike for the space creatures, Hera and her crew came to their aid and managed to shoot down both fighters.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nAfter the dogfight, Hera and Sabine realized that the purrgil were traveling towards the same asteroid gas refinery they were heading to. With the ship low on power, she ordered her crew to switch off all power appliances. While conversing with Ezra, Hera confided her personal animosity towards the purrgil. In her childhood, Hera had heard tales about how the purrgil had inspired the development of hyperspace travel. However, she had since grown to view the purrgil as a menace to hyperspace travel since they collided into starships. She had lost more than one of her friends to the space creatures. Ezra then suggested that the purrgil were ignorant of the damage they were causing.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nShortly later, the ''Ghost'' arrived near the asteroid gas refinery, which was based on a [[Unidentified planetoid (Mining Guild)|large planetoid]]. Under Hera's orders, Sabine and Chopper landed the ship on a cliff overlooking the refinery. After the crew had assembled in the cockpit, Hera and Sabine outlined their plans to steal [[Clouzon-36]] fuel canisters from the refinery. As part of the plan, Sabine along with Kanan, Chopper, and Ezra would jump onto the refinery's bridge. They would then plant explosives to destroy the platform before seizing the fuel canisters lying on the main landing platform, where they would be picked up by the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nWhile Hera and Zeb stayed aboard to maintain the ''Ghost'', the other rebels landed on the gas refinery. After Ezra convinced the other rebels to delay their plan to blow up the refinery, Hera grumbled when she learned that this change was linked to the purrgil. When the rebels had secured the landing platform, Sabine contacted Hera and Zeb to bring the ''Ghost'' down. Hera initially complained that she would have to brave enemy fire until Sabine reminded her that their job as rebels did not come with guarantees. Once they had landed, Hera stayed at the controls of the ''Ghost'' while Zeb powered up the ship using one of the canisters. The other rebels also loaded their stolen canisters onto the ship.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nWhen the ''Ghost'' had almost finished powering up, Hera and her crew found themselves encircled by the Mining Guild boss [[Yushyn]], several armed Rodian guards, and two more TIE fighters. Yushyn demanded that the rebels surrender. However, Ezra and the purrgil attacked the Mining Guild forces. This commotion allowed the crew of the ''Ghost'' to escape the landing zone. Before leaving, the ''Ghost'' destroyed the gas refinery in order to deny its services to the Empire. Later in space, they were reunited with Ezra who explained that the purrgil depended on the Clouzon-36 fuel to survive and to jump into hyperspace. After the purrgil jumped into hyperspace, Hera decided to follow them; having overcome her prejudices towards the space creatures.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\n====A difficult family reunion====\n[[File:Hera_and_Cham_Syndulla.png|thumb|right|250px|Hera and her father Cham had a strained relationship after she left Ryloth.]]\nLater, Hera and the crew of the ''Ghost'' were involved in a mission to deliver supplies to a Hammerhead corvette over an ice world. Supported by Phoenix Squadron, they managed to hold off several Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer. Once the supplies were delivered, the Hammerhead corvette, the ''Ghost'', and Phoenix Squadron managed to escape into hyperspace however [[Phoenix Two]] was killed by enemy fire. With the rebellion losing [[pilot]]s and [[starfighter]]s rapidly, Hera realized that the rebels needed a safe place to land and shelter their starfighters. Hera and Kanan consulted with Commander Sato, who suggested that the rebels steal an Imperial [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|fighter carrier]] sighted above Ryloth, the homeworld of Hera's Twi'lek species. Realizing that they needed local assistance, Hera contacted her father Cham, with whom she had not spoken with for years.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nCham agreed to help and arrived with two colleagues [[Numa]] and [[Gobi Glie]] on a [[Nu-class attack shuttle|''Nu''-class attack shuttle]]. After exchanging greetings, Hera briefed both her rebels and the Ryloth rebels about her plan to infiltrate and hijack the Imperial fighter carrier using a stolen [[TIE/sa bomber]]. Disagreeing with his daughter's plans, Cham instead advocated destroying the fighter carrier to show the Ryloth resistance's strength. After some disagreement, Cham and his rebels reluctantly agreed to support Hera's plan. Following the meeting, Hera retreated to a separate room with Chopper and Ezra.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nWhile repairing Chopper, Hera told Ezra and the astromech droid about her difficult relationship with Cham. Her father was a freedom fighter who had devoted his entire life to fighting both the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Empire for a free Ryloth. After her mother died, Cham had neglected his daughter in order to commit his life to the rebellion. Shortly later, Cham entered the room and told them that they needed to prepare for their [[Mission to Ryloth (Phoenix Squadron)|mission]]. After Ezra departed, Hera engaged in a tense conversation with her father. Cham chided his daughter for her close relationship with Chopper and for not devoting her life to freeing Ryloth. Speaking in a Twi'lek accent, Hera responded that the rebels were fighting to free everyone including Ryloth. Unable to resolve their differences, Cham stormed out of the room.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nAs the Spectres and their Twi'lek allies traveled to Ryloth, Cham ingratiated himself with Hera's crew and regaled Kanan and Ezra with a recollection of his exploits during the Clone Wars. Knowing her father better, however, Hera warned Kanan not to fully trust him. After exiting hyperspace, the two rebel groups entered their stolen TIE bomber and approached the fighter carrier. Two rebel A-wing starfighters then exited hyperspace and attacked the rebel's bomber. This ruse allowed the rebels to dock in the fighter carrier's hangar bay under the pretext of seeking refuge. Hera then deliberately crash-landed the bomber to convince the Imperials that the damage was real.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\n[[File:Homecoming-episode-gallery_137_17ec86f9.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The acquisition of the Imperial fighter carrier boosted the Phoenix rebels' forces.]]\nBefore Hera and her rebel comrades could begin their mission, Cham and the Twi'lek rebels stunned them and proceeded with their original mission to destroy the fighter carrier. Later, Hera woke up and kicked Chopper to rouse the droid. Chopper freed her from her restraints and helped free the other rebels. After Ezra and Sabine informed her that the Twi'leks had a bag of [[Detonator/Legends|detonators]], Hera realized that they were going to blow up the fighter carrier and resolved to stop them. Hera and Chopper followed Kanan and Ezra as they navigated their way through the ship's corridors and dodged stormtroopers and closing blast doors. Together, the four rebels made their way to the command bridge. There, Ezra used a Jedi [[mind trick]] to force the Imperial commander to order a general evacuation of the fighter carrier.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Sabine and Zeb managed to overpower Numa and Gobi in the munitions racket. On the bridge, Hera and her rebels confronted her father Cham, who had sabotaged the ship's hyperdrive. Hera tried to reason with her father again. She pointed out that if the rebels destroyed the fighter carrier, the Empire would send another. However, if they stole the carrier, they could use it to fight back against the Empire. Cham responded that he wanted revenge against the Empire for exploiting Ryloth's resources and its people. He wanted to destroy the ship to show what the Ryloth resistance could accomplish. Hera responded that Ryloth's freedom struggle was part of a greater rebellion against the Empire. In the end, Hera managed to win over her father by telling him that he had inspired her to join the rebellion against the Empire.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nWorking together with the Twi'lek rebels, the crew of the ''Ghost'' resolved to prevent Imperial reinforcements from retaking the fighter carrier. They managed to use the ship's weapons systems to shoot down several TIE fighters and an [[Sentinel-class landing craft|Imperial landing craft]]. The two rebel cells also managed to destroy an Imperial light cruiser by throwing a rigged TIE bomber into its path, causing it to explode. After Chopper repaired the hyperdrive, Hera and the rebels managed to escape into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nFollowing the successful heist, Hera reconciled with her father. Cham commended his daughter for galvanizing the Ryloth rebels through her actions in stealing the fighter carrier. In return, Hera thanked her father for teaching her the importance of leadership. Hera and her rebels watched as Cham and his Twi'lek comrades departed on their shuttle for space.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\n====Mission to Geonosis====\n[[File:The_rebels_arrive_at_Geonosis.png|thumb|right|250px|Hera and the rest of the ''Ghost''{{'s}} crew arrive at the Geonosis construction field.]]\nAfter rebel intelligence discovered that the Empire was once building [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|something]] above [[Geonosis]], Hera and the crew of the ''Ghost'' were tasked with acquiring any information they could find aboard an [[ICM-092792|Imperial construction module]] above the planet. Upon arrival, Hera ordered Chopper to conduct a planetary scan, but no life was detected. Hera assured the crew they don't know the [[Geonosian]]s were dead for sure and continued towards the construction module. While Hera, Chopper, and Rex stayed aboard the ship, the other rebels ventured into the complex. Before long, they discovered that they had stumbled into a trap set by Agent Kallus, a perennial enemy of the Spectres. A firefight ensued and the ''Ghost'' came under attack from three hidden All Terrain Defense Pod walkers. An Imperial astromech droid closed the blast doors on the rebels but was soon dispatched by Chopper, who proceeded to re-open the doors, allowing the other rebels, with the exception of Zeb, to escape back aboard the ''Ghost'' and flee into space.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\">{{Rebels|The Honorable Ones}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Zeb fled into an escape pod while pursued by Kallus. Due to a malfunction in the pod's engines, the two foes crash-landed into a cave on the icy moon of [[Bahryn]]. Meanwhile, Hera piloted the ''Ghost'' and led three TIE fighters on a wild chase. After destroying two of the TIEs, Hera flew the ''Ghost'' through one of the construction modules and Kanan used one of the ship's rear turrets to fire on the final pursuing TIE, causing it to collide with an AT-DP walker. Once they were safe, Hera supervised the rebels' efforts to locate Zeb.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\" />\n\nAfter a few hours, they were able to pick up Zeb's [[Escape pod transponder|transponder]] signal from Bahryn. Zeb and Kallus had managed to overcome their differences and struck an unlikely friendship to overcome the cold and ward off several [[bonzami]] beasts. Hera landed the ''Ghost'' near Zeb's shelter. Zeb offered Kallus a place aboard the ship but the Imperial agent opted to wait for his Imperial comrades. Hera and her crew greeted Zeb at the ''Ghost''{{'s}} exit ramp and together they returned into space.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\" />\n\n====Parting with the Jedi====\nAfter Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper had returned from a mission to scout [[Oosalon]] as a potential rebel base site, Kanan instructed Hera to meet them in deep space without the rest of the fleet. Hera complied with Kanan's instructions and rendezvoused with the ''Phantom'' in deep space. Once Kanan and Ezra had entered the ''Ghost'', Hera asked Ezra how the ''Phantom'' was faring. Ezra replied that she should ask Chopper, who had been flying the ship. Hera and Zeb later learned that the two Jedi had run into two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister on Oosalon. Hera listened while Kanan expressed his fears that the Inquisitors would make it hard for him and Ezra to help the rebels establish a base.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\">{{Rebels|Shroud of Darkness}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Ghost'' was also hosting Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi Padawan who was an ally of the rebels. Later, Hera along with Zeb and Sabine watched Kanan, Ezra, Ahsoka, and Chopper depart into hyperspace on the ''Phantom'' from the ''Ghost''{{'s}} windows. When Sabine asked where their comrades were going, Hera replied that it was sometimes best not to know. In the absence of Hera and the other rebels, the three Jedi traveled to the Jedi Temple on [[Lothal]] where they experienced Force visions from [[Yoda]]. They managed to escape the temple before the Inquisitors and Darth Vader arrived.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\n====Heist at Horizon Base====\nLater, the rebel leadership identified [[Berzite's moon]] in the [[Yost system]] as a potential site for a rebel base. However, they lacked enough fuel to travel there. At the suggestion of Sabine's friend Ketsu Onyo, Hera and the crew of the ''Ghost'' agreed to [[Heist at Horizon Base|raid]] the Imperial fuel depot at [[Horizon Base]] for supplies. Upon traveling there, Hera devised a plan which involved the rebels raiding the depot while Chopper stayed behind with the ''Ghost'' to watch out for Imperial forces. When Chopper coveted a [[Ambulatory strut|droid leg]] on sale nearby, Hera reminded him that they were not on Horizon Base to shop and that they had an urgent mission. However, Chopper disobeyed Hera's instructions and visited the stall.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\">{{Rebels|The Forgotten Droid}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Hera and her other companions approached the fuel depot but found it heavily guarded. When Hera reiterated that they could not leave without the fuel, Kanan told them to get the fuel \"quietly with no complications.\" The rebels managed to steal the fuel but were pursued by Imperial stormtroopers. Since Chopper was not around, they were forced to leave him behind. Once in hyperspace, Ezra raised the matter of going back to Horizon Base to rescue Chopper. However, Hera was still angry with Chopper for disobeying her orders and criticized the astromech droid for only looking out for himself. She then stressed that the rebel fleet was more important. Shortly later, they received a transmission from Commander Sato that the rebel fleet was under attack.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nUpon exiting hyperspace, they found the Phoenix rebel fleet under attack from Imperial forces under Admiral Konstantine. Hera then approached the rebel fighter carrier to unload the fuel supplies but was harried by several TIE fighters and laser fire from Konstantine's Star Destroyer ''Relentless''. After some difficulty, Hera managed to land the ''Ghost'' with the help of Ketsu's starship ''[[Shadow Caster]]''.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nWhile the fighter carrier was being refueled, Hera received a transmission from Chopper, who had managed to hijack an [[Class four container transport|Imperial cargo ship]] with the help of the former Imperial [[inventory droid]] [[AP-5]]. Hera was still annoyed with Chopper and informed him that they were about to travel to the Yost system. Overhearing the conversation, AP-5 warned Hera that the Empire had set a trap in that system. While Hera was initially skeptical, Chopper backed AP-5 up and defended him as a friend. Hera was surprised that Chopper had managed to find a friend. AP-5 then revealed he knew another planet called [[Atollon]] that had no Imperial presence.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nHera relayed this information to Commander Sato, who alerted the fleet about their change of location. AP-5 tried to send the coordinates but was attacked by the [[Unidentified Imperial cargo ship captain|Imperial cargo ship's captain]] and badly damaged. Chopper managed to knock out the captain and then relayed the coordinates to Hera and Commander Sato. Due to AP-5 and Chopper's actions, the rebel fleet was able to escape the trap at the Yost system and reached Atollon. There, they were reunited with Chopper and AP-5.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nAfter scanning the system, Hera and Kanan were satisfied that there was no Imperial presence there; making it safe for the rebels to start up a base. Hera was present when Sabine repaired AP-5 using parts from Chopper's stolen droid leg. She and the other crew also watched the verbal exchange between the two droids with bemusement.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\n====Securing Chopper Base====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Hera_farewell.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kanan bids Hera farewell with a goodbye hug before setting off on his mission to Malachor]]\nFollowing the discovery of Atollon, Hera and the Spectres aided the Phoenix rebels with the establishment of [[Chopper Base]]. The ''Ghost'' delivered supplies to the rebel base. During one supply run, Hera and Sabine took the opportunity to watch a lightsaber training session between Ezra and Kanan. After Ezra was unsettled by Sabine's comment about his lightsaber skills, Hera assured him that she meant that his skills were good. Upon landing at Chopper Base, Hera delivered a supply of power generators to the former inventory droid AP-5.<ref name=\"Mystery\">{{Rebels|The Mystery of Chopper Base}}</ref>\n\nWhile at Chopper Base, Hera took the opportunity to express her unease with Kanan about his plans to travel with Ezra and the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka to the planet [[Malachor]]. Hera feared that she would lose her lover, but Kanan stressed that their mission was necessary for the survival of the Rebellion. Later that evening, Hera and her crew responded to a distress call from Sabine and Rex. Earlier, Sabine and Rex had visited the base's northern perimeter to respond to the disappearance of [[Lieutenant]] [[Dicer]], who had vanished after planting a [[sensor beacon]]. However, the two rebels had come under attack from several [[krykna]], large spidery creatures that were native to Atollon.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nPiloting the ''Ghost'', Hera and her crew managed to scare off the krykna and rescue Sabine. However, Rex was taken captive by the creatures. After assigning Chopper to guard the ship, Hera and the other rebels ventured into the krykna's underground lair. Aware of the Jedi's imminent departure, Hera instructed Kanan and Ezra to search one part of the lair while she and the other rebels searched a different part. Shortly layer, Hera and her companions stumbled into the krykna's nest where they managed to free Rex but were unable to find Dicer. After rejoining Kanan and Ezra, the rebels and Rex fled back to the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nOnce aboard, Hera attempted to fly the ship but the ''Ghost'' was held down by a web spun by the krykna. While Ezra, Kanan, and Zeb manned the ship's [[laser cannon]]s, Hera instructed Sabine to divert all auxiliary power to the hull. This had the effect of shocking the krykna but it failed to drive them away. After Hera's rebel companions managed to recover the sensor market and break free of the web, Hera was able to fly the ''Ghost'' back to the safety of Chopper Base.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nOn the way, she disagreed with Rex's assessment that they should abandon the base. She contended that the rebels should not give up because they had already poured so much effort into finding the base. At the advice of Kanan, Hera and the Phoenix rebels decided to erect a perimeter fence around the base consisting of sensor markers to ward off the krykna. Before Kanan and Ezra left for Malachor, she spoke with her lover. When Kanan tried to assure her that he would be alright, she sensed that he was lying and confided that she preferred that they face their challenges together. Kanan then promised Hera that they would see each other again. Before leaving, he embraced her.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\n====Staying behind on Atollon====\nHera, along with Sabine, Zeb, and Rex stayed behind while Ezra, Kanan, Chopper, and Ahsoka traveled to Malachor. Hera and the other rebels were present at Chopper Base's runway when the ''Phantom'' returned. After the ship had landed, Hera embraced her love, whose eyes were covered by a blindfold. Later, Hera and the other rebels were aboard the ''Ghost'' as they came to terms with Kanan's blindness and Ahsoka's apparent death on Malachor.<ref name=\"Twilight\">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>\n\n====Rescuing Sabine and Ketsu====\n[[File:TheGhostEscapes.png|thumb|right|250px|The ''Ghost'' escapes a Garel docking bay]]\nOn Garel, Sabine and Ketsu were attempting to smuggle food offplanet for the Rebellion; however, their mission went awry when they were discovered by stormtroopers. In order to escape, Sabine contacted Hera. Shortly thereafter, Hera and Chopper arrived in the ''Ghost'' and lowered the boarding ramp for Sabine and Ketsu escape. As reinforcements began to arrive, Hera and the rest of them escaped the docking bay. On the ''Ghost'', Hera congratulated Ketsu and Sabine on a mission well done.<ref name=\"Recruit\">{{FOD|Newest Recruit}}</ref>\n\n====Sabine's speeder====\n[[File:HeraApproachesSabine.png|thumb|left|250px|Hera approaches Sabine in order to meet Ketsu at the rendezvous point]]\nSometime later, Ketsu informed the ''Ghost'' crew about an [[Ketsu Onyo's informant|informant]] and told them to meet her at a rendezvous point on Garel. Shortly before departing for the mission, Sabine was polishing her [[Undicur-class jumpspeeder|speeder]] when Hera walked in and informed Sabine that they were late to meet Ketsu. The two then took Sabine's speeder and set course for the rendezvous point. Soon after they arrived, Ketsu arrived and crashed her own speeder bike, causing it to explode. Hera handed Ketsu the [[datacard]] and, needing a new speeder, was given Sabin's as a replacement, much to the chagrin of Sabine. Ketsu then headed off and the two headed back.<ref name=\"Crash\">{{FOD|Crash Course}}</ref>\n\nBack on the ''Ghost'', Sabine was pacing in worry for Ketsu as she had called in but still hadn't returned; however, Hera was able to reassure her that everything would be fine. Just then, Ketsu returned with only the handling bars remaining. Hera attempted to tell Sabine to not do anything she would regret, but she accepted Ketsu's apology instead; however, she was still going to have to put the speeder back together with her, to which Hera told them that she had tools for them. The three then went off to repair the bike.<ref name=\"Crash\" />\n\n====Stealing an Imperial shuttle====\n[[File:HeraAndSabineWaitForAShuttle.png|thumb|right|300px|Hera and Sabine wait to steal an Imperial shuttle]]\nHera and Sabine were sent to an Imperial facility in order to obtain [[Medkit|medical supplies]] for the Rebellion. Sabine told Hera that the transport they were looking at was the correct transport but Hera remained skeptical. However, Sabine hastily decided that this was the correct transport and the two rushed onboard the shuttle. The two quickly took off, not realizing that a second transport had been concealed by medical crates.<ref name=\"Hasty\">{{FOD|Hasty Departure}}</ref>\n\nHera ordered Sabine to check on the medical supplies, but, noticing the transport was filled with stormtroopers, Sabine realized this was the incorrect transport. Rushing back into the cockpit, Sabine informed Hera that there were stormtroopers in the back and that they were on the wrong ship. As the stormtrooper began cutting through the door, Hera began to maneuver the ship so that the stormtroopers would be thrown around. As Hera asked where Chopper was, he piloted the other shuttle to be right next to them, revealing the second shuttle. Seeing Chopper, Sabine came up with a new plan to jump to the other shuttle from the cockpit. She attempted to shoot the glass around the cockpit, but Hera grabbed her arm and popped it off using the ship's controls. Before jumping, Hera shot the controls so the stormtroopers couldn't attack them after they cut through to the cockpit. Sabine extended her arm, waiting for Hera to jump, and, when she did, she just barely managed to grab on to the boarding ramp. Sabine helped her up, and, as Hera made it onto the ship, the stormtroopers finally cut through and realized that they were about to fall to certain doom as Sabine and Hera watched.<ref name=\"Hasty\" />\n\nHera told Sabine that that was more difficult than it needed and Sabine apologized for her mistake. Hera accepted her apology and headed for the cockpit where Chopper was waiting for them.<ref name=\"Hasty\" />\n\n====Rescuing the argora====\nHera took the ''Ghost'' and the Spectres to a class four container transport that transported rare creatures to the Emperor's [[Emperor's personal zoo|personal]] [[zoo]]. Hera told the Spectres the mission was to rescue a rare bird known as the [[argora]] and return it to [[Xendek]]. Hera flew the ''Ghost'' to distract the TIEs while the other Spectres took the ''Phantom'' to board the freighter.<ref name=\"Endangered 1\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=7|story=[[Endangered, Part 1]]}}</ref> Hera regrouped with the Spectres and took the argora back to Xendek.<ref name=\"Endangered 2\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=8|story=[[Endangered, Part 2]]}}</ref>\n\n====Working with Hondo====\n[[File:Hera_finds_Kanan_meditating.png|thumb|right|250px|Hera stumbles upon a meditating Kanan]]\nLater, Hera flew Ezra and his team to the planet [[Naraka]] during a [[Rescue of Hondo Ohnaka|mission]] to rescue Hondo Ohnaka from the [[Naraka prison|Imperial prison]] there. While Ezra and his strike team freed Hondo and his [[Ugnaught]] companion [[Terba]], Hera remained airborne with the ''Ghost''. At Ezra's instruction, she carried out a \"[[44 scoop]]\" and safely evacuated the rebels and Hondo. Once in the cockpit, Hera asked Zeb and Ezra whether the AT-DP walker had been helping them. Ezra then explained that he \"had to do what he did.\" After Sabine mentioned that Hondo's companion Terba had died, Hera reminded Ezra that he was responsible for everyone under his wing. In response, Ezra retorted that he was not responsible for Terba's death and stormed off. Hondo also thanked Hera for the rescue but then demanded to be paid.<ref name=\"Steps\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Chopper Base, Hera reminded Hondo that they had repaid him by rescuing him from the Imperial prison. She rebuffed him when he tried to bribe her into selling the ''Ghost''. At the briefing, Hera watched as Hondo detailed the Imperial salvage operation at [[Reklam Station]] on the gas planet of [[Yarma]]. Hondo explained that his friend Terba had been a laborer there who had worked on dismantling decommissioned [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing starfighters]]. When Hera asked about the Y-wings, Rex reassured her that they were reliable combat starfighters. When Ezra advocated with proceeding with the mission, Hera advised sending a reconnaissance mission first. As a compromise, Commander Sato promoted Ezra to [[Lieutenant Commander]] and placed him in charge of the mission to Reklam Station.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nWhen Hera told Ezra that his master would be proud, he shrugged that his master was never there. After the briefing, Hera found Kanan meditating at the edge of Atollon Base. She told him that she had expected to see him at the briefing. Hera also told Kanan to reassure Ezra that he was not to blame for the events that occurred on Malachor earlier. Later, Hera contacted Ezra to inquire about his progress with the recon mission. Despite Ezra's explanation that things were good, Hera and Sato quickly deduced that Ezra had unilaterally embarked on a recovery mission. Ezra and Sato then gave orders to mobilize the Phoenix fleet. Hera then departed on the ''Ghost'' and was joined by Kanan, who had returned from his meeting with the enigmatic Force-wielder known as the [[Bendu]].<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nAt Yarma, Hera flew the ''Ghost'' to the disintegrating Reklem Station. Kanan opened the rear exit and rescued Ezra from falling into the volatile depths of the gas planet. Ezra then tried to apologize for getting the ''Phantom'' destroyed but Hera told him to explain later. The ''Ghost'' and the rebel fleet then escaped into hyperspace after the Imperial tactician [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] allowed them to escape. After arriving back at Chopper Base, Hera reprimanded Ezra for disobeying his orders, endangering his team, and getting the ''Phantom'' destroyed. As punishment, she relieved him of his duties as Lieutenant Commander. When Zeb tried to vouch for his friend, Hera explained that Ezra had been responsible for the mission. She then informed Sabine that the five stolen Y-wings had been transferred to [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group|unit]].<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\n====Prisoners of Maul====\nHera along with Chopper, Zeb, and Sabine was taken prisoner by the former Sith Lord [[Maul]], whom Kanan and Ezra had earlier encountered on Malachor. Maul had lured the rebels into a trap by attacking the crew of a Hammerhead corvette and forcing them to send a distress signal to the ''Ghost''. Once aboard the ''Ghost'', Maul overpowered the rebels and took them prisoner. After securing them in restraints and posting repurposed [[RIC-1200|tour guide droids]] as sentries, Maul contacted Kanan and Ezra and demanded that they hand him the Sith holocron and Kanan's Jedi holocron in return for the save return of their friends. Later, Maul forced Hera to take him on a tour of the ''Ghost''. Hera took him on a tour of the cabins before entering Kanan's quarters.<ref name=\"Holocrons\">{{Rebels|The Holocrons of Fate}}</ref>\n\nAfter discovering Hera's reluctance to tell him the location of the Kanan's holocron, Maul weakened her by revealing that he knew Kanan's real name: Caleb Dume. Following Hera's shocked silence, Maul probed her mind, discovering the hidden holocron inside a shelf and \"thanking\" Hera for not putting up a strong resistance. While Maul was preoccupied with trying to open the Jedi holocron, Hera and the other rebels tried to escape. At her direction, Zeb kicked Chopper into two of Maul's tour guide droids. After knocking out Maul's droids, the rebels fled down the ladder into the cargo hold. However, Maul followed them. Hera then instructed Chopper to activate the magnetizer in order to trap the [[cyborg]] Dark Sider. Despite their best efforts, Maul used his lightsaber to break free and then attacked the rebels with his Force powers. After beating them into submission, Maul warned Hera and Sabine that they were only alive as long as they were useful to him.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nLater, Maul took his prisoners to the Mandalorian [[space station]] [[Vizsla Keep 09]] where he had agreed to rendezvous with Ezra and Kanan. Despite promising Ezra that he would spare his friends, Maul secretly ordered his droids to execute the prisoners. However, Kanan managed to destroy the tour guide drops before they could execute Hera and her crew. Hera and the other rebels then rushed to the command center where they found that Maul and Ezra had [[Holocron fusion|activated]] both holocrons. Hera shouted for Ezra but could not see him in the bright pink glow. However, Kanan could see his apprentice and convinced Ezra to close his eyes, ending the ceremony. Despite escaping Maul and recovering the holocrons, they failed to prevent the former Sith from escaping.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\n====Recruiting a defector====\nAfter Imperial forces destroyed a rebel convoy to [[Teralov]], Hera attended a briefing chaired by Commander Sato. During the briefing, Sato shared a recording from a rebel agent called Fulcrum who informed them that several cadets at the elite Imperial [[Skystrike Academy]] were planning to defect to the rebellion. When Ezra asked whether Fulcrum was Ahsoka Tano, Hera explained that Fulcrum was a pseudonym for several rebel agents. Hera assigned the former Imperial cadet Sabine on an [[Escape from Skystrike Academy|undercover mission]] to rescue these cadets. She and Zeb then left to escort a new supply convoy to Teralov. Later, Hera and the other rebels welcomed Sabine and the two cadets [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Derek Klivian|Hobbie]] at Chopper Base.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\">{{Rebels|The Antilles Extraction}}</ref>\n\n====Return to Ryloth====\n{{Quote|It is a pity our first encounter might well be our last.|Grand Admiral Thrawn, to Hera|Hera's Heroes}}\n[[File:Heras_Heroes_thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Hera and Ezra sneaking through her own house.]]\nLater, Hera and her crew returned to her homeworld of Ryloth on a supply mission. On the way, she rescued her father Cham, and his comrade Numa from an Imperial patrol. While father and daughter were happy to see each other, Hera was saddened to learn that Imperial forces had invaded their provincial home of [[Tann Province]] and captured their [[Syndulla residence|home]]. Hera was further devastated to learn that her mother's heirloom, the [[kalikori]] had also been left behind. Hera was determined to recover the heirloom but insisted upon going alone. However, Cham and her entire crew insisting on coming with her, saying that whatever was important to Hera was also important to them.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\">{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}</ref>\n\nWhile Cham and the others created a diversion, Hera and Ezra sneaked into her family estate, which had been converted into an Imperial base disguised as a [[scout trooper]] and a captured Twi'lek insurgent. There, they rendezvoused with Chopper, who had traveled there disguised as an Imperial droid. Once inside, they headed to Cham's old office. Along the way, they passed by Captain [[Slavin]] and the [[Chiss|blue-skinned]] Grand Admiral Thrawn; the mastermind behind the recent Imperial advances in Tann province. After recovering the Kalikori, Hera and Ezra proceeded to find their way out.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nHera and Ezra attempted to escape through a secret passage in the basement but found that it had been converted into a command center. With Chopper's help, the two rebels tried to get past the stormtrooper sentries guarding the front door. However, Hera ran into Thrawn and Slavin. Slavin mistook her for a servant and chastised her for not staying in the kitchen. Hera tried to leave but Thrawn ordered the stormtroopers including a disguised Ezra to bring her to his office for questioning. Once there, Hera pretended to be a peasant girl who tried to steal the Kalikori to obtain money for her family.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nSlavin was fooled by her charade but Thrawn quickly deduced that the servant girl was none other than the rebel fighter Hera Syndulla, the daughter of Cham and a key rebel operative. With Hera's cover blown, Ezra attempted to shoot Thrawn and Slavin but Thrawn [[stun]]ned him first. Hera was then forced by her Imperial captors to carry Ezra to a cell. Upon arriving in the cell, the trooper knocked her to the ground. Thrawn apologized that it would be their last meeting but promised to keep the Kalikori in a place of honor. When Hera responded that she would rather destroy the artifact then let it fall into the hands of an enemy, Thrawn mocked her about not respecting her history. He then thanked Hera for her hospitality before leaving Captain Slavin to \"finish the job.\"<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nCaptain Slavin then contacted Hera's father Cham and offered to free Hera and Ezra if he agreed to surrender by dawn. If he rejected Slavin's terms, Slavin threatened to execute Hera and Ezra. However, the Imperials had failed to capture Chopper; mistaking him for an Imperial droid. The astromech droid entered Hera's cell to inform her and Ezra about Cham's plan to surrender in order to free them. When Ezra suggested escaping, Hera advised against it because there were too many stormtroopers around. She instead told Ezra and Chopper they would proceed with the exchange. However, she gave Chopper orders to plant explosives throughout the building in order to create a diversion that would allow everyone to escape.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nAt dawn, Cham arrived aboard the ''Ghost'' outside the Syndulla household. Hera and Ezra were led by Captain Slavin to the ''Ghost''. Slavin agreed to Cham's request for a simultaneous exchange and the two parties crossed. In secret, Slavin had given his men orders to shoot the ''Ghost'' and capture the rebels. However, Hera ordered Chopper to activate the explosives. This created an explosion that knocked out the Imperials and allowed all of the rebels to flee aboard the ''Ghost''. After Thrawn allowed them to escape in order to observe an \"experiment,\" the rebels fled into Ryloth's wasteland. There, Hera affirmed her love for her father, Kanan, and her crew. In her view, her family was more important than the Kalikori.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\n====Mission to Agamar====\nLater, Hera and Sabine flew the other Spectres and Rex to the planet [[Agamar]] to salvage [[proton bomb]]s from a [[Unidentified DH-Omni Support Vessel (Agamar)|derelict]] [[DH-Omni Support Vessel|Separatist supply ship]]. When Hera asked them if anything could go wrong, Ezra assured them that they would be alright since they had Rex, a veteran of the Clone Wars, with them. Despite Ezra's confidence, the rebels' [[Mission to Agamar (2 BBY)|mission]] when awry when the rebels encountered a [[Separatist holdouts|Separatist holdout]] led by the [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] [[Kalani]]; who forced them to take part in a simulated battle. In the end, the two factions joined forces to fight off Imperial forces that had been sent by Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]].<ref name=\"The Last Battle\">{{Rebels|The Last Battle}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Hera and Sabine took the ''Ghost'' to raid a fuel depot but were pursued by three TIE fighters. While both had not heard from the other rebels, they agreed that Rex and Kanan would contact them if they needed help. Hera and Sabine their Imperial pursuers. Later, Hera contacted Kanan via intercom to inquire about the progress of the mission. Without telling her about their adventure with Kalani, Kanan told Hera they had not found the proton bombs but that they had instead found a [[Phantom II|new transport]] for the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\n====Trouble on Concord Dawn====\nAfter the rebellion lost contact with the [[Protectors Camp]] on the [[Third moon of Concord Dawn]], Hera summoned Sabine Wren and Fenn Rau for a briefing at the war room. During the meeting, Fenn Rau, who was a prisoner of the Phoenix Squadron, reassured the rebel leaders that his men were not setting a trap and offered to investigate the matter. Hera allowed Fenn to return but issued orders that he be kept in [[magnetic binders]]. She also dispatched Sabine, Ezra, and Chopper to escort Rau on a recon probe on Concord Dawn. She gave them strict orders not to land the ship and to avoid contact with hostiles. Finally, Hera warned the other rebels not to lose the ''Phantom II'' since they had just gotten the ship. During the [[Second mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|mission]], Fenn and the rebels discovered that the Imperial [[Viceroy]] [[Gar Saxon]] had wiped out the Protectors. With his group destroyed, Fenn decided to join the rebellion.<ref name=\"ISC\">{{Rebels|Imperial Supercommandos}}</ref>\n\n====Evacuation of Mykapo====\nWhen Commander Sato received intelligence that the Empire was planning to impose martial law on the planet [[Mykapo]], Hera led the Spectres and Phoenix Squadron on a mission to evacuate rebel sympathizers there. Upon arriving in the system, Hera and her fellow rebels discovered a [[YT-2400 light freighter]] being attacked by TIE fighters. After directing a Hammerhead corvette to evacuate the civilians, Hera and her crew came to the assistance of the freighter, whose crew were a local rebel cell called the [[Iron Squadron]]. The Iron Squadron declined Hera's offer of assistance and destroyed an Imperial ''Gozanti''-class cruiser.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\">{{Rebels|Iron Squadron (episode)|Iron Squadron}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Skirmish over Mykapo|skirmish]], Hera and Kanan reported on their encounter with Iron Squadron to Commander Sato. Sato believed that his nephew [[Mart Mattin]] had taken command of Iron Squadron following the death of his [[Mart Mattin's father|father]]. He asked Hera to bring his nephew back. After Kanan and Zeb left to assist with the evacuation, Hera docked the ''Ghost'' with the Iron Squadron's freighter ''[[Sato's Hammer]]''. Hera along with Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper met with Mart and his crew [[Gooti Terez]], [[Jonner Jin]], and their astromech droid [[R3-A3]]. Despite her best efforts, Hera was unable to convince the Iron Squadron to leave Mykapo with them.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nHera reluctantly allowed Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper to stay behind on the ''Phantom II'' and reason with Iron Squadron. Meanwhile, Hera and the rest of Phoenix Squadron returned with the rebel fleet and the evacuated civilians. In her absence, Ezra and Sabine managed to convince Gooti, Jonner, and [[R3-series astromech droid|R3]]-A3 to leave with them. However, Mart stayed behind and attempted to take on an Imperial force led by Admiral Konstantine. Mart was no match for Konstantine's forces and sustained damage to his ship's engine. However, he managed to send out a distress signal to the rebels.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nBack at the ''Ghost'', Hera convened a meeting with her crew, the Iron Squadron, and the holographic forms of Rex and Commander Sato. Since Sato was far away, Hera agreed to lead a rescue mission to save Mart. Hera and her team traveled back to the system in the ''Ghost''. While outrunning Konstantine's starfighters, Hera managed to contact Mart and learned that the Imperials had attached a [[magno-mine]] to ''Sato's Hammer''. Under Hera's instruction, Chopper and R3-A3 managed to dislodge and deactivate the mine. They then reattached it to one of the ''Sato's Hammer''{{'s}} cargo containers.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nHera managed to pick up Mart, his ship, and the droids. Shortly later, Commander Sato arrived with reinforcements and attacked the Imperials. Hera then flew over Konstantine's light cruiser and Mart dropped his bomb, which damaged the cruiser. Hera and the rebels escaped just as Grand Admiral Thrawn arrived on his Star Destroyer ''[[Chimaera]]''. After returning to Chopper Base, Commander Sato thanked Hera and her crew for rescuing his nephew. They then watched as Sato embraced Mart, who in turn embraced his crew.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\n====Mission to Wynkahthu====\n[[File:Lothal_rebels_and_pirates_discuss_recovery_mission.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Syndulla and the others devise a plan to recover cargo from a stranded Imperial cargo ship]]\nHera and the Spectres met with the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka and his new associate Azmorigan aboard the ''Ghost'' to discuss working together to recover cargo from a stranded Imperial cargo ship inside the planet [[Wynkahthu]]. Hera distrusted Hondo and was hostile towards Azmorigan due to their unpleasant encounter with Lando Calrissian. When Azmorigan recognized Hera as the \"feisty one\" who had hit him, she labeled him a \"bag of bantha fodder\" who had tried to buy her from Calrissian. Hondo managed to convince Hera and her crew to work with them after revealing that the cargo ship was carrying proton bombs, a commodity desired by the rebellion.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\">{{Rebels|The Wynkahthu Job}}</ref>\n\nAfter studying the location of the Imperial cargo ship, Hera reluctantly agreed to send her crew to help Hondo and Azmorigan salvage their \"treasures\" in return for obtaining the proton bombs. Since they were unable to offload the cargo from the ship due to the dangerous windy conditions and a nearby vortex, Hera assigned the former Imperial inventory droid AP-5 with the task of formulating a plan to board the ship and access its cargo. Unhappy with Ezra's cozy relationship with Hondo, Hera assigned Zeb leadership of the mission. When Ezra protested, Hera reminded the young Jedi that Hondo was untrustworthy.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nHera, Kanan, and AP-5 stayed aboard the ''Ghost''{{'s}} command bridge while Zeb and his salvage team boarded the Imperial cargo ship. While the salvage team explored the Imperial ship, Hera and her crew received word from Sabine, who was stationed in the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cargo bay, that the winds were picking up. As a result, Hera requested a status report from Zeb. By that stage, the salvage team had reached the Imperial ship's cargo bay. Once the rebels had opened the cargo ship's doors, Hera flew the ''Ghost'' towards the cargo bay. Zeb then used the grappling guns to fire magnetic cables which stuck to the hull of the ''Ghost''. These were used to ferry the proton bombs and other cargo aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nThe recovery mission was complicated by the presence of [[DT-series sentry droid]]s aboard the ship. One of the sentry droids captured Azmorigan and Zeb and locked them away in the brig. To complicate matters further, a lightning bolt struck the cargo ship and cost it to list towards the vortex. Hera ordered Ezra to evacuate the cargo ship. Following a brief skirmish with the sentry droids, the rebels and their confederates managed to flee back with the ''Ghost''. The salvage team also rescued the Ugnaught [[Melch]], one of Hondo's workers who had smuggled himself aboard a treasure chest. Hera took the opportunity to taunt Hondo about \"things not working out.\" With both sides having achieved their goals, Hera ordered Hondo and his crew to continue their conversation aboard their ship.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\n====Mission to the Imperial Armory Complex====\nHera along with Sabine, Zeb, and Commander Sato stayed behind while Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper undertook a [[Infiltration of the Imperial Armory Complex|mission to infiltrate]] the [[Imperial Armory Complex]] on Lothal. Hera corresponded with their local contact Azadi by hologram after Ryder lost contact with Ezra's team due to an Imperial lockdown. Hera recognized the new Imperial commander as Grand Admiral Thrawn, whom she had previously encountered on Ryloth. She and her comrades listened as Ryder informed the Phoenix Squadron about his plan to attack the factory's east gate.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\">{{Rebels|An Inside Man}}</ref>\n\nAfter Ezra and his team had stolen the plans and escaped the factory, Hera and Zeb were present when Sabine decrypted the plans, which turned out to be the blueprint for a [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|TIE Defender]], a new starfighter that was equipped with deflector shields. Hera and Kanan feared that the new starfighter would pose a danger to the rebellion if manufactured in large numbers. When Hera learned that the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus had helped Ezra's team escape, she advised her comrades to exercise caution in dealing with Kallus until they could discern what game he was playing.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n====The Spectre of Maul====\nFollowing the events on Lothal, Hera briefed the Spectres, Rex, and other members of Phoenix Squadron on its planned strike on the Imperial Armory Complex. She planned to send a small unit instead of the entire squadron. When she noticed that Ezra Bridger was distracted, Hera reminded him to stay focused because he had been assigned leadership of the mission. She briefed Ezra that his mission involved infiltrating Lothal and collecting intelligence on the Imperial orbital defenses.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\">{{Rebels|Visions and Voices}}</ref>\n\nHera then informed Ezra that the strike team would be leaving as soon as they have loaded up. When Hera asked for questions, Sabine Wren asked if Grand Admiral Thrawn was on Lothal. She responded that there had been an increased capital ship presence above Lothal but that there was no confirmation of Thrawn's presence. At that point, Ezra became distressed after seeing visions of Maul. When he fainted, Hera asked Kanan what was wrong but her lover had no answers.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nLater, Hera and the other Spectres were present in Ezra's quarters when the boy awoke. When Hera asked what happened, the boy claimed that he saw Maul. This led Hera to suspect that Ezra had seen a Force vision. When Chopper told Ezra to get up, Hera chastised the astromech droid. Ezra then insisted that he was alright and able to proceed with the mission. In private, Hera talked with Kanan, who was concerned that Ezra was still affected by his last encounter with Maul and the holocrons. Kanan's concerns were validated when a maddened Ezra attacked a rebel trooper, whom he mistook for Maul.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nAs a result, Ezra was relieved of his role in the Lothal strike. When Hera proposed delaying the mission and staying behind with Ezra, Kanan advised her to proceed with her original plan and reassured her that he would take care of Ezra. Hera departed on the ''Ghost'' while Ezra, Kanan, and Sabine stayed behind to deal with the threat of Maul.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\n====Mission on Geonosis====\nOn the request of Senator Organa and Commander Sato, Hera, her fellow Spectres, and Rex accepted a [[Mission to investigate Geonosis|mission]] to find [[Saw Gerrera]] and investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species. Upon arriving above Geonosis, Hera noticed that the Imperial construction module and the debris that they had seen during their [[Ambush on an Imperial construction module|last mission]] to the planet had been cleared away. Hera flew the ''Ghost'' through a sandstorm towards a Geonosian structure where [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]] had last picked up Saw's signal.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\">{{Rebels|Ghosts of Geonosis}}</ref>\n\nHera split her crew into two teams. She assigned Rex, Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper with exploring the structure while Zeb and Sabine were tasked with tracing a nearby power source. Rex's team soon encountered Saw and helped him to capture a Geonosian who he believed knew what the Empire was building on Geonosis. Meanwhile, Sabine and Zeb discovered a military-grade deflector shield generator in the middle of the desert. Hera stayed aboard the ''Ghost'' and maintained contact with her teams via [[comlink]].<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nSince Rex's team was underground, Hera had trouble contacting them until they reached an air shaft which led to the surface. Kanan then warned Hera about the presence of operational [[battle droid]]s on the planet. Shortly later, Sabine and Zeb were surrounded by several [[droideka]]s after extracting the [[deflector core]]. Saw and Rex's team managed to disable the droidekas by capturing the Geonosian, whom Ezra later nicknamed \"[[Klik-Klak]].\" After Sabine and Zeb returned to the ''Ghost'' with the deflector core, Hera allowed Zeb to enter the labyrinth with a communication device in order to find Rex's team.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nAfter establishing contact with Kanan, Hera agreed to rendezvous with Rex's team inside the air shaft. Hera managed to evacuate her ship and Zeb just as they came under attack from two TIE bombers. Zeb and Sabine managed to shoot down the bombers but the Empire was now alerted to their presence. Hera rendezvoused with Rex's team, Saw, and Klik-Klak in the air shaft. Aboard the ''Ghost'', Hera exchanged pleasantries with Saw. She also privately warned Kanan about Saw's harsh methods. However, disagreement soon emerged between the rebels when Saw reneged on an earlier agreement with Kanan and tried to forcibly take Klik-Klak offworld for interrogation.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nThe Spectres and Saw put aside their differences to rebel a [[Jumptrooper]] boarding party that had been dispatched by Captain [[Brunson]]'s [[Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]]. While her comrades and Saw repelled the Jumptroopers, Hera took the ''Ghost'' into the depths of Geonosis. At the bottom, the rebels discovered evidence that the Empire had perpetrated [[Sterilization of Geonosis|genocide]] against the Geonosians. Experiencing a change of heart, Saw allowed Klik-Klak to retreat with the [[Karina|last Geonosian queen egg]] into the deep levels of Geonosis.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nAfter collecting visual imagery of the poison canisters, the Spectres and Saw fled aboard the ''Ghost''. Captain Brunson attempted to bury them alive by collapsing the air shaft on top of them. However, Hera outmaneuvered the Imperial captain by ordering her crew to fire cannons and proton bombs at her light cruiser. This set the Imperial cruiser ablaze and allowed the rebels to flee into hyperspace. Later, Hera informed Commander Sato and Senator Organa that they had obtained visual evidence of the Imperial poison canisters. Commander Sato commended the Spectres for rescuing Saw and obtaining a deflector core. When Kanan warned Ezra that not all their allies shared their values and reasons for fighting the Empire, Hera responded that they should be content that Saw was not the Empire.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\n====Training exercise====\nCaptain Syndulla along with Kanan, Ezra, and Sabine departed on a training exercise with the rest of the Phoenix rebels including Wedge Antilles and Hobbie. Prior to departing, she assigned Captain Zeb the position of [[Chief of Security]] at Chopper Base. When Zeb pleaded not to be left behind, Hera reassured him that Chopper and the inventory droid AP-5 would keep him company. She and the other Spectres then departed on the ''Ghost'' for the exercise.<ref name=\"Warhead\">{{Rebels|Warhead (episode)|Warhead}}</ref>\n\nIn her absence, Zeb and his droid companions neutralized the Imperial [[E-XD-series infiltrator droid]] [[EXD-9]], who had [[EXD-9's infiltration of Chopper Base|infiltrated]] Chopper Base. They then reprogrammed the infiltrator droid into an improvised bomb that destroyed a Star Destroyer. The following day, Zeb contacted Hera to report that he had managed to resolve the incident. Hera was annoyed to have to return to Chopper Base and was bemused to receive a message from Fulcrum congratulating the rebels for neutralizing the infiltrator droid. She then watched as Zeb playfully muzzled AP-5 before he could recount the full details of the event.<ref name=\"Warhead\" />\n\n====Sabine's trials====\nAfter learning about the significance of the [[Darksaber]] from Kanan and Fenn Rau, Hera convened a meeting of her crew in the ''Ghost''{{'s}} common room to discuss the matter of training Sabine to wield the ancient [[lightsaber]] so that she could rally the Mandalorians over to the rebel cause. When Sabine expressed self-doubt and refused to take on the role, Hera explained that the rebels needed [[Clan Vizsla|her family's]] help to rally the Mandalorians over to the rebel cause. Hera stressed that the Mandalorians could help with their planned assault on Lothal. After some contemplation, Sabine reluctantly agreed to undergo training with the Darksaber.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\">{{Rebels|Trials of the Darksaber}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sabine-trials-of-the-darksaber-header.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sabine Wren wielding the Darksaber.]]\nWhile Hera stayed behind with the other rebels, Sabine along with Kanan and Ezra traveled into the wilderness for her training. After two days, Hera contacted Kanan to request an update. When she learned that Kanan was making Sabine train with sticks, Hera pointed out that he had not held back Ezra's training. Kanan responded that he was trying to be careful; prompting Hera to reply that he was doubting Sabine's abilities because she was not Force-sensitive. When Hera asked what supplies they needed, Kanan replied that all they needed was patience and understanding.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nLater, Sabine stormed out from training after disagreeing with Kanan's methods. Hera and Kanan corresponded via hologram. When Kanan opined that it was too dangerous for Sabine to train with the Darksaber since she had not found balance yet, Hera countered that inhibiting her training would hamper her commitment. Hera pointed out that Sabine had already been hurt by her family. She opined that letting Sabine claim ownership of the Darksaber would allow her to face her demons. Despite Kanan's reluctance, Hera reminded her lover that it was not about him. Kanan ultimately took up Hera's advice and Sabine was able to come to terms with her past and training.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\n====Ferrying Mon Mothma====\nAt the request of Senator Organa, Hera and the Spectres undertook a mission to meet another group of rebels in deep space. While awaiting the arrival of their objective among the debris of [[Munificent-class star frigate|two]] [[Recusant-class light destroyer|former]] Separatist cruisers, the Spectres, listening to an Imperial HoloNet broadcast by [[Alton Kastle]], discovered that Senator [[Mon Mothma]] was wanted by the Empire for condemning the [[Ghorman Massacre]]. Shortly later, the rebels sighted a [[X3-13|tactical infiltration pod]] that was carrying an E-XD infiltrator droid, which Zeb and Chopper had encountered earlier on Atollon. Despite Hera's attempts to escape detection by powering down the ''Ghost'' and Chopper, the droid spotted their ship and Ezra was forced to destroy the pod during a brief pursuit.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nShortly later, a rebel [[Taylander shuttle]] ''[[Chandrila Mistress]]''<ref name=\"Chandrila Mistress DB\">{{Databank|chandrila-mistress|Chandrila Mistress|archivedate=20170504122521}}</ref> and several Y-wings belonging to [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]]. [[Gold Leader]] [[Jon Vander]] hailed Hera and asked if they had caught them at a bad time. Hera replied that they had a close call with an Imperial probe and that there was a chance that the droid had alerted the Empire. After the ''Chandrila Mistress'' docked with the ''Ghost'', Hera and her crew met Jon and Mothma's senatorial attache [[Erskin Semaj]]. While Erskin was unable to discuss their cargo, the rebels allowed Hera's crew to refuel their Y-wing starfighters.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n[[File:ChandrilaMistress-RebelsS03E18.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Ghost'' and the ''Chandrila Mistress'']]\nWhile refueling the Y-wings, Hera's crew argued with the pilot [[Gold Two (rebellion)|Gold Two]] and Vander over tactics and the secrecy of their mission. The argument was interrupted by the arrival of an Imperial light cruiser and a ''Gozanti'' cruiser. After Gold Two was wounded, Hera told Zeb to carry the pilot to the medbay. She also allowed Ezra to fly Gold Two's Y-wing. During the attack, Hera told Chopper to jettison the fuel pod and the two attempted to detach the ''Ghost'' from the ''Chandrila Mistress''. When the rebel shuttle was stricken, Hera managed to help the ship's crew and passengers which included Mon Mothma to board the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nAfter breaking free of Mothma's stricken shuttle and damaging the Imperial light cruiser, Hera took the ''Ghost'' and her Y-wing escorts into hyperspace. In hyperspace, Hera and her crew met with Mon Mothma and her staff. Mothma was determined to travel to [[Dantooine]] in order to rally the rebel cells and factions into an [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|alliance]] to restore the [[New Republic|Republic]]. Since the Empire had placed the system on lockdown, Hera proposed that the rebels travel through the dangerous [[Archeon pass]] which went through the [[Archeon Nebula]]. However, Thrawn anticipated Hera's plan and dispatched his prototype TIE Defender to flush out the rebels so that Governor Pryce and Admiral Konstantine's Star Destroyers could intercept them.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nDuring the journey, Mothma told Hera about her decision to resign from the Imperial Senate and the two women became friends. The ''Ghost'' and Gold Squadron was soon pursued by Commander [[Vult Skerris]]'s TIE Defender and two [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE Interceptors]]. During the [[Operation Handoff|ensuing dogfight]], three Y-wings were destroyed. Hera took the convoy deeper into the Archeon Nebula and managed to lose the two TIE Interceptors. Unable to shake off the TIE Defender, Hera instructed Vander and Mothma to distract the fighter while she took the ''Ghost'' and Mothma out of the Nebula.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n[[File:Secret_Cargo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Syndulla was present for Mon Mothma's declaration of the Alliance to Restore the Republice]]\nUpon exiting the Nebula, the ''Ghost'' was intercepted by two Imperial Star Destroyers. Governor Pryce ordered the ''Ghost'' and Mon Mothma to surrender. While Hera and Chopper prepared the hyperdrive, Mothma tried to stall the Imperials with a list of demands. However, Pryce rejected their demands and ordered Konstantine to activate their Star Destroyer's tractor beam projector. Hera tried to shut down the ship but to no avail. Fortunately for Hera and Mothma, Ezra and Vander exited the Archeon Nebula. Under Hera's orders, the rebels fired their proton torpedoes into the nebula, creating an explosion that damaged the two Star Destroyers.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nThe ''Ghost'' and the remaining Y-wings then fled into hyperspace. After arriving above Dantooine, Jon Vander praised Hera for her valor and creativity. The rebels then watched as Mon Mothma delivered a speech in the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cockpit outlining why she had resigned from the Imperial Senate and [[Declaration of the Rebel Alliance|announcing]] the formation of an Alliance to Restore the Republic. Shortly later, Hera and her crew witnessed a rebel fleet forming above Dantooine, beginning the [[Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n===Alliance to Restore the Republic===\n====Saving Chopper from himself====\nFollowing the formation of the Rebel Alliance,<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" /> Captain Syndulla assigned AP-5 on a [[Mission to recover Imperial codes|mission]] to steal clearance codes from an [[Killun Station|ISB station]] on [[Killun 71]]. As a back-up, Hera also sent Chopper and Wedge Antilles. During the course of the mission, Chopper was reprogrammed by a team of Imperial intelligence officers based aboard an [[IGV-55 surveillance vessel]]. Their controller [[LT-319]] wanted to use Chopper to find the location of Chopper Base.<ref name=\"DAD\">{{Rebels|Double Agent Droid}}</ref>\n\nWhile AP-5 was suspicious of Chopper's changed behavior, Wedge and the other Spectres dismissed his warnings. However, Hera listened to AP-5's warnings and managed to stop Chopper from downloading the ''Ghost''{{'s}} hyperspace logs. She reminded Chopper that she wiped his memory after every jump for security reasons. Before she could recharge Chopper, the droid abruptly left the room. Realizing that AP-5 was indeed right, Hera warned the other Spectres and Wedge but told them to be gentle with her droid. Shortly later, Chopper deactivated the hyperdrive and detached the ''Ghost'' from its ''Sentinel''-class landing craft escort.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\n[[File:Ghost_cargo_bay_DAD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hera and the crew after Chopper opened the cargo bay doors]]\nHera and the other crew headed to the engine room to confront Chopper but were trapped inside the cargo bay. Chopper's Imperial controller LT-319 then ordered the droid to expose his fellow crew to [[Realspace|zero gravity space]]. Hera managed to reseal the cargo bay manually with great difficulty. She then sent AP-5 outside to open the hatch leading to the cargo bay from outside. Despite an attack by Chopper, AP-5 managed to open the hatch back to the ship but was thrown into space. After Zeb stunned Chopper, Hera advocated striking back against the Empire for harming her droid.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nRealizing that the Imperial intelligence operators were operating from a ship with a powerful communications array, Hera used Chopper to reverse their feed on them. Hera also used Chopper's visual processor to send a defiant message to LT-319 and his crew. The information overload caused the Imperial surveillance ship to blow up in space. As Chopper reverberated, a distraught Hera placed her hands on his chassis and pleaded for him to return. To Hera's relief, Chopper rebooted and restored his original programming. The rebels then rescued an unwilling AP-5 from space. Following an altercation between AP-5 and Chopper, Hera joked that nobody messed with her droid.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\n====Maul's last stand====\nAfter Ezra heard messages from Kanan Jarrus' holocron and the [[Sith holocron (Malachor)|Malachor Sith holocron]] hinting that the [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] was in danger from Maul, Hera along with Kanan, Rex, Chopper, and Commander Sato attended a meeting with Ezra. Believing that Kanan's holocron was playing back a broken recording, she counselled Ezra to remain on Atollon in order to train for their upcoming attack on Lothal. She stressed that they needed Ezra's local knowledge for the mission to succeed. Ezra listened to Hera's words but later left with Chopper on an [[RZ-1T trainer]] to find Kenobi on [[Tatooine]].<ref name=\"Twin Suns\">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>\n\nThe two rebels managed to find Kenobi after enduring an attack by [[Tusken Raider]]s and the scorching desert heat. Kenobi counseled Ezra to return to Lothal because the boy's place was with the rebels. Kenobi then defeated and killed Maul. After Ezra and Chopper returned on Maul's starship [[Nightbrother (Gauntlet fighter)|''Nightbrother'']], Hera along with Kanan and Zeb met the two wayward rebels. Ezra apologized to Hera and Kanan for running away and accepted that his place was with his new family and the rebellion.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\n====Siege of Atollon====\nAs part of the planned rebel attack on the TIE Defender factories on Lothal, Hera and Commander Sato coordinated their operations with General Dodonna's Massassi Group, one of the largest rebel cells at the time. While at Chopper Base with her rebel comrades, she convened a hologram briefing with Commander Sato and General Dodonna, who was stationed aboard the ''[[Phoenix Nest]]'' and the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]] ''[[Vanguard]]''. Later, Hera convened another hologram meeting with the other rebel commanders and their Lothalian contact Azadi to discuss a garbled transmission from Fulcrum stating that Thrawn has discovered their whereabouts. Heeding Ezra's warning that the Empire had discovered Chopper Base and that an attack was imminent, Hera ordered the rebel ships to assume battle station mode.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle_of_Atollon.png|thumb|left|250px|The rebels engage the Seventh fleet]]\nHera's decision proved timely because Thrawn's [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] soon exited hyperspace and blockaded the [[Atollon system]], trapping the rebels. After Ryder's hologram projection disappeared, Hera realized that the Imperials were jamming their long-range communications. Escape into hyperspace was rendered impossible when the Imperials deployed an [[Interdictor-class Star Destroyer|Interdictor vessel]]. Hera and the other commanders watched as Grand Admiral Thrawn addressed the rebels via hologram. Hera was not intimidated by the Chiss Grand Admiral and responded that they would not surrender. However, Thrawn replied that he was not willing to accept surrenders yet until he had brought utter defeat raining down on them.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nStudying the holomap, Hera realized that the rebels were outmatched and outnumbered by the Imperial fleet. In response, Hera devised a plan to attack the blockade so that Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper could escape offworld aboard the ''Nightbrother'' and seek reinforcements. Hera expressed her displeasure when Kanan insisted that he had to go into the wilderness to warn his friend Bendu. Hera reluctantly relented and assigned the mission to Ezra and Chopper. Hera flew the ''Ghost'' with Rex and Zeb serving as her gunners. The rebel fleet then launched an attack on the Imperial blockade but sustained heavy casualties. Hera tasked the fighters and starships with protecting Ezra's [[Kom'rk-class fighter/transport|Gauntlet fighter]] so that he could escape. In the end, Ezra's ship managed to escape when Commander Sato rammed his command ship into the Interdictor cruiser; temporarily breaking the interdiction field. However, the rebels sustained heavy losses and were forced to retreat to Chopper Base.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n[[File:RexAndZebVsATATs-SWRS03E22.jpg|thumb|right|313x313px|Thrawn's walkers attack]]\nAfter returning to Chopper Base, Hera studied the holomap and realized that the Imperial fleet was preparing to launch an [[orbital bombardment]]. Zeb and Rex managed to use Sabine's prototype deflector shield generator to create a defensive umbrella that withstood the bombardment. Hera also pleaded with Kanan to return home. Kanan, who had been unsuccessful in persuading the Bendu to help the rebels, barely escaped the bombardment. In response to the Imperial ground assault, Hera approved General Dodonna and Rex's plan to ambush Imperial forces along the canyon leading to Chopper Base. The rebels managed to destroy several AT-DP walkers with [[detonator]]s but were forced to flee when Thrawn deployed AT-AT walkers, that were protected by deflector shields. Thrawn's stormtroopers then stormed Chopper Base.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nDuring the ground battle, Hera told General Dodonna to prepare the remaining rebel ships for departure. When Dodonna asked about the blockade, Hera responded that she was willing to die aboard the ''Ghost''. Fortunately for the rebels, Ezra and Chopper returned with [[Clan Wren]] reinforcements led by Sabine. The Mandalorians managed to destroy Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser. Meanwhile, Hera and the remaining rebels including Kanan were surrounded by Thrawn's [[death trooper]]s. Thrawn demanded their surrender and threatened to kill Hera's comrades if she refused. However, Bendu intervened and unleashed a thunderstorm against Imperials and rebels alike. While Thrawn and his forces fought with Bendu, Hera and her remaining rebels escaped aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n[[File:EscapingAtollon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Syndulla and the remaining rebels escape Atollon]]\nHera led the rebel convoy into space and expressed shock at the volatile nature of Kanan's \"friend.\" Bendu even hurled lightning at the ''Ghost'' and struck one of the A-wing fighters. Due to Ezra and Sabine's efforts, the rebels managed to escape into hyperspace. Hera also picked up Agent Kallus, who had escaped Thrawn's flagship aboard an escape pod. Hera then led the rebel convoy to [[Yavin 4]]. During the journey, Hera thanked Sabine's mother [[Ursa Wren]] for helping the rebels in their time of need. Hera also allowed Sabine to return to her mother to aid Clan Wren's [[Mandalorian Civil War (Imperial Era)|civil war]] against [[Clan Saxon]] but apologized that the rebels were unable to offer them assistance yet.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n====War on Mandalore====\nHera managed to lobby the rebel leader Mon Mothma into allowing Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper leave to aid Sabine and Clan Wren's efforts to [[Mission to Mandalore|rescue]] [[Alrich Wren]], Sabine's father and the head of Clan Wren who had been imprisoned by the Imperial proxy Governor [[Tiber Saxon]]. Sabine and a joint rebel and Mandalorian force attacked Alrich's [[Mandalore prison outpost|prison]] only to discover that the Empire was already transporting him to the capital [[Sundari]] for execution. Following the attack, Kanan contacted Hera via hologram to extend their time on the planet Mandalore.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore]]''</ref>\n\nHera reminded Kanan that they could not stay for long on Mandalore and had to return after rescuing Alrich. When Kanan stressed Alrich's importance to the Mandalorians, Hera responded that the Spectres were important assets to the Rebellion. Kanan expressed unease at the use of the term \"assets\" and asked Hera how she felt about his absence. After bidding each other farewell, Hera allowed Kanan to depart for the mission to ambush an Imperial convoy carrying Alrich. After rescuing Alrich, the rebels and their Mandalorian allies destroyed Governor Saxon's [[Arc Pulse Generator|the ''Duchess'']], a powerful weapon capable of incinerating Mandalorian warriors by targeting the [[beskar]] alloy in their [[Mandalorian armor|armor]].<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" /> Hera then went on a supply run with Antilles using several Y-Wings. However, she crash-landed on Yavin. She then met up with the other Spectres. She then went to the briefing to report on the supply run's failure.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref>\n\n====Destruction of the Jalindi relay and kyber crystal====\n[[File:In_the_Name_-_Briefing.png|thumb|right|300x300px|Syndulla and the others attend a briefing on Jilandi Station]]\nDespite Bridger asking to return to Lothal, Hera and the Spectres were then assigned by Mothma to [[Mission to Jalindi|highjack]] the [[Jalindi Station|Jalindi relay]]'s transmissions. Aboard the ''Ghost'', Hera and Kanan then assigned Sabine and Ezra to install data spikes into the relay. Hera then spoke with Kanan about their orders. She wanted to hurt the Empire, but Kanan reminds that it was Gerrera's way, not hers. He assured Hera that she and the other Spectres would do the right thing. As the ''Ghost'' approached Jalindi, Hera scrambled its signature.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\nAfter dropping off Sabine, Chopper, and Ezra on the relay, Hera was informed that an [[Marauder|Imperial light cruiser]] had arrived. She was then contacted by Sabine that the Empire had seen them. Hera and the ''Ghost'' then came under attack by several TIE/D Defenders and were forced to leave Ezra and Sabine. Hera, with Kanan's help, then flew the ''Ghost'' threw a fog. After the TIE/D defenders were destroyed in the fog, Hera then saw the Relay being destroyed. She was then contacted Ezra, who told them they were rescued by Gerrera and were taken aboard [[Edrio]]'s [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]]. Before leaving Jalindi, Hera was worried about what Gerrera was up to.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\nHera was then contacted by Chopper from an [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]]. After the Kyber crystal exploded, Hera found their shuttle. Hera then offered to take [[Mich Matt]] and his fellow technicians back to their homes. However, they offered their services to the Rebellion. Hera accepted their offer.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" />\n\n====Return to Lothal====\nFollowing the mission, Hera and the Spectres then returned to Yavin. There, Mothma informed Hera and the Spectres about Azadi's last transmission revealing a new TIE/D Defender being built. Hera volunteered for all the Spectres to return to Lothal.<ref name=\"Occupation\">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>\n\nHera and the Spectres hired Vizago to smuggle them past the blockade. She left Rex and Kallus in charge of the ''Ghost'' when they boarded the ''Broken Horn''. As the ''Broken Horn'' made it's landing, Hera saw a pair TIEs coming to escort them and surmised that they were scanned by the Empire. After they landed, Hera and the other Spectres split up to avoid the Empire on Lothal. She and Kanan went through the streets. There Kanan took her aside and said it's been a while since they've been alone together. Kanan wished he could see Hera, but Hera assured him that he could always see her. However, they were then contacted by Zeb, who found their speeders conveniently enough.<ref name=\"Occupation\" />\n\nHera and the other Spectres then regrouped when there was an explosion. They were then joined by Jai Kell who took them into one of the sewer tunnels under Jho's. There, they found several [[Starbird (symbol)|Starbirds]] painted in the tunnels that led them to a ladder where they met up with Azadi.<ref name=\"Occupation\" /> Hera and Kanan then set up comlink between herself and the other Spectres at Ezra's [[LothalNet comm tower E-272|old hideout]] during their [[Theft of the TIE Defender Elite|theft]] of the Empire's new TIE/D defender at the [[Lothal Imperial airfield|Imperial airfield]].<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\">{{Rebels|Flight of the Defender}}</ref>\n\nHera then heard that the [[TIE/D Defender Elite]] had crashed with Sabine and Ezra aboard. She then took Azadi's U-wing and searched for the two spectres. Hera then found them safe and sound.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" /> After Zeb returned with both the hyperdrive and [[flight data recorder]], Hera then helped Sabine to install the TIE/D Defender Elite's hyperdrive onto Azadi's U-wing so that she could take the Defender's [[Flight recorder]] back to Yavin. Before she left, Hera then kissed Kanan and left with Chopper. Hera then ran into several TIEs, which had been ordered by Grand Admiral Thrawn to intercept the rebels. At the last moment, Hera then flew the U-wing through one of the construction modules and activated the U-wing's hyperdrive to make her escape. The jump ignited the contents of the construction module.<ref name=\"Kindred\">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>\n\n====Attack on Lothal====\n{{Quote|I know the odds are against our attack's success. But if that fighter goes into production, our squadrons will not stand a chance. I believe it's a risk worth taking.

Hera and Chopper then waited for the group to come to a decision about Lothal. During the debate, Hera was told by Mothma that Empire had initiated [[Protocol 13]], an Imperial code that resulted in the immediate evacuation of all Imperial personnel of an occupied planet. Upon hearing this, Hera then stormed into the meeting to tell the other Rebel leaders that now was the time for their attack. Mothma then gave her permission to launch her attack. Hera was then able to make contact with the Spectres and Azadi's cell to inform them of their upcoming<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>\n\nHera was then given the rank of General as well as a squadron of 24 [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]]s and Y-wing bombers. With Chopper as her co-pilot, Hera then led her squadron [[Attack on Lothal|against]] Thrawn's blockade at Lothal. Hera then ordered her pilots to protect the bombers. During the dogfight, Hera then fought Commander Skerris's TIE/D Defender Elite and lead both her and Skerris back to the ''Chimaera''. There, Hera was able to disable the ''Chimaera's'' sensor array, disable Skerris's TIE/D Defender and force him to crash into [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]].<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\">{{Rebels|Rebel Assault}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HeraSyndullaSeasonedCaptain-CM.png|thumb|right|250px|Syndulla piloted an X-wing fighter to break the blockade of Lothal.]]\nHera and what remained of her squadron then entered Lothal's atmosphere. However, she and her fellow pilots then came under attack by more TIEs. Hera was then forced crashed into an alleyway in the Capital City. Hera then had Chopper attempt to contact Kanan and the other Spectres to no avail. Hera then found Mart Mattin in the city as well and rescued him from several stormtroopers. Hera was then given R3-A3's transmitter so Chopper could make contact with Kanan.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\nHowever, the Empire was jamming all transmissions. Hera and Mattin then tried to make their way of the Capital. They then came under attack by Thrawn's assassin, [[Rukh]] and started to run away. Hera then had Mattin and Chopper go into the sewer while she delayed the Empire. Hera then fought Rukh in hand-to-hand combat and was able to disarm him. Rukh was able to knock her out regardless, however, Chopper and Mattin managed to drive Rukh off with blaster fire, allowing the rebels to escape him.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\nAs they made their way through the streets, Hera then saw the Imperial forces arriving. Hera then took a speeder and made their way to a sewer entrance. However, Rukh captured her before she could join Chopper and Mattin in the sewer. Hera told them to go without her and shot the entrance to close it. Hera was then disarmed by Rukh. She was then stunned by Governor Pryce and taken prisoner.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\n====Captivity and rescue====\nFollowing her capture, Hera was taken to the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]] in Capital City where she was [[torture]]d by the sadistic Pryce. When Grand Admiral Thrawn entered and asked if Hera had divulged the location of the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Rebel fleet]], Pryce responded that she had not begun questioning her prisoner yet. Thrawn questioned Hera but she remained defiant. In an attempt to break Hera's resolve, Thrawn brought her family's Kalikori, which he had taken from her on Ryloth a year earlier. When Thrawn noted that one of the symbols on the Kalikori represented a [[Hera Syndulla's brother|deceased loved one]], Hera responded that Thrawn was unworthy of holding it. Believing Hera's end to be near, Thrawn left Pryce to interrogate Hera and headed to [[Coruscant]] to lobby the Emperor for continued support for his TIE/D Defender initiative.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\">{{Rebels|Jedi Night}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CruelMethods-CM.png|thumb|left|250px|Pryce took enjoyment from torturing Syndulla.]]\nWith Pryce unwilling to cooperate, the Governor had an [[IT-O Interrogator]] droid inject her with a [[truth serum]] as part of a mind probe. As she was being injected, Hera spotted Kanan scaling down the [[transparisteel]] windows with [[magnetic climber]]s. When Hera called out his name, Pryce thought that the rebel leader was being delusional and left to confer with Rukh, who suspected that Hera's fellow rebels were mounting a rescue mission. After Pryce had left, Hera warned her two stormtrooper captors that they were in terrible trouble.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\nAt that point, Kanan sliced through the floor with his lightsaber, causing one of the stormtroopers to fall to his death. He then hurled the second out the window before stabbing the Interrogator droid and throwing it down the hole. After Kanan freed her, the couple embraced. While Hera joked about Kanan's untidy hair, she was heartened that he had recovered her Kalikori from Thrawn's office. The two then fled the room before Pryce, Rukh and several death troopers could enter the room. They reached the garbage chute where Kanan and the other Spectres had parked their [[Loth-bat glider]]s. Despite being pursued by Rukh and death troopers, the two managed to escape on one of the gliders.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\nHera landed the glider at the [[Lothal City fuel depot]]. While waiting for Ezra and Sabine to join them in their stolen police gunship, Hera expressed her feelings for Kanan and the couple kissed passionately. Shortly, Ezra and Sabine arrived on their gunship. Before they could leave, Governor Pryce arrived with several AT-AT walkers and bombarded the fuel depot in an attempt to destroy the rebels. Hera managed to flee aboard the gunship but Kanan stayed behind and used the Force to hold back the explosive wave. Hera attempted to bring Kanan into the gunship but Kanan used the Force to push her back. The two then made eye contact as Kanan's eyes were healed, fulfilling his promise to \"see her again.\" Kanan pushed the gunship out of harm's way but was consumed by the explosive wave, [[Death|killing him]]. A grief-stricken Hera and her fellow rebels then fled back to the rebel base on their gunship.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\n====Mourning Kanan's passing====\n{{Quote| You know, Chop, despite all his misgivings about the rebellion, he always believed we could change things. That's what I'll miss the most, that when none of us could find the answer, Kanan could, and always in the most unexpected way.|Hera Syndulla, to Chopper, on Kanan|DUME}}\nHera and her rebel comrades were deeply affected by Kanan's death at the Lothal City fuel depot. Following Kanan's death, Hera spent some time mourning for the man she loved. With a distraught Hera unable to fully participate in the Lothal resistance's meeting, Sabine and Zeb proposed sabotaging the Empire's victory parade in Capital City as a retaliatory act. Retreating to her private quarters, Hera castigated herself for not expressing her feelings to Kanan earlier. While Hera was holding her Kalikori, Chopper wheeled over to comfort her. Hera recalled Kanan's earlier warning that it was too early to launch the war and expressed her regret at not listening to him.<ref name=\"DUME\">{{Rebels|DUME}}</ref>\n\nChopper then changed the subject by pointing out that Kanan had gotten Hera her family's Kalikori back. Hera agreed and recalled that Kanan had found it for her in the midst of everything. When Chopper convinced Hera that Kanan's selfless sacrifice in rescuing her and her entire family history made him worthy of being added to the Kalikori, Hera decided to add a piece of Kanan's holocron onto her Kalikori in honor of her lover's memory. She then confided in Chopper that Kanan believed he could change things despite his misgivings about the Rebellion.<ref name=\"DUME\" />\n\nHera and Chopper were then joined by Sabine and Zeb, who revealed that Kanan's death was not in vain since the explosion that consumed him had also destroyed the Empire's fuel supply on Lothal and damaged the TIE Defender factory, knocking out Imperial military production on Lothal. Ezra then returned from his encounter with the [[Loth-wolf|Loth-wolves]] in the wilderness and revealed that the Lothal Jedi Temple was in danger.<ref name=\"DUME\" />\n\n====Destroying Lothal's Jedi temple====\nAt the urging of Ezra, Hera, Sabine, Zeb, and Chopper took part in a [[Mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple|mission]] to save the Lothal Jedi Temple from the Galactic Empire. When Hera asked how he had obtained the [[Lothal Jedi Temple key stone]], Ezra told her that the Loth-wolves had given it to him. The Spectres traveled on a pack of Loth-wolves to the Lothal Jedi Temple, which was located in the planet's northern hemisphere. The Loth-wolves were capable of generating [[hyper tunnel]]s, which enabled the rebels to travel there swiftly. After arriving, Hera and her fellow rebels discovered that the Empire and Mining Guild were [[Excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple|excavating]] the Jedi Temple. Hera along with Zeb and Chopper kept a vigil on the outskirts of the camp while Ezra and Sabine infiltrated the excavation site disguised as scout troopers.<ref name=\"W&D\">{{Rebels|Wolves and a Door}}</ref>\n\nAfter tapping the Imperial Minister [[Veris Hydan]]'s communications and learning that the Emperor was interested in the [[Painting of the Mortis gods]], Hera was unsure whether they should continue but Zeb reminded her about why they had come. After feeling Kanan's ghostly presence around her, she told Ezra and Sabine to continue with the mission but to be prepared to leave. When Zeb said that they would be fine, Hera replied that she used to believe that. Using the keystone as a guide, Ezra managed to unlock the painting,<ref name=\"W&D\" /> which was a gateway to the [[World Between Worlds]]. However, Sabine was captured by stormtroopers and brought to Minister Hydan, who identified her as a rebel infiltrator. After Hydan placed the camp on locked down, Hera, Zeb, and Chopper fled farther away from the camp.<ref name=\"AWBW\">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref>\n\nOutside the temple, Hera discussed the situation with Zeb and Chopper. They knew that Sabine had been taken into Hydan's [[mobile command center]] but were unsure if Ezra had entered the temple. The Spectres decided to rescue Sabine and infiltrated the camp. While Chopper watched over the mural of the Mortis gods, Hera and Zeb headed to the mobile command center. Climbing under the structure, Hera began to activate one of the center's thrusters. Hera instructed Zeb by sending a coded signal to Sabine once she was ready. Hera's plan worked and the mobile command center fell on its top over several crates. Sabine managed to escape the structure and joined Hera and Zeb in escaping the scene. The rebels were pursued by Hydan's stormtroopers and a gun battle ensued. Chopper also commandeered a [[Mining Guild excavation driller]].<ref name=\"AWBW\" />\n\nThe Spectres were reunited with Ezra, who managed to escape the World Between Worlds. After Ezra sealed the portal with the help of Sabine and Zeb, the rebels escaped on the excavation driller. Later, the rebels returned to the Lothal Jedi Temple, which had completely sunk into the ground. While surveying the site, the two made peace with Kanan's death before departing.<ref name=\"AWBW\" />\n\n====Mustering allies====\n[[File:Hera_mustering_allies.jpg|thumb|left|291x291px|Syndulla mustering allies]]\nShortly after, Ezra devised a plan to [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] Lothal as Thrawn's absence would give them the advantage they did not have before. While Ezra and Ryder Azadi planned their campaign, Hera along with Kallus and Rex traveled to the planet Seelos aboard the ''Ghost'' to recruit several old allies of Ezra including the former Clone Commanders Wolffe and Gregor, Ohnaka, Melch, and Onyo. Despite the odds stacked against them, the group decided to help Ezra as a favor to an old friend.<ref name=\"AFH\">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>\n\nOn the way back to Lothal, Hera, at the advice of Hondo, had the ''Ghost'' wait in space until an Imperial cargo ship arrived. Though Hera and Kallus had their misgivings about Hondo's plan, she agreed to trust the Weequay pirate. When the [[Cargo freighter EF-75]] arrived, Hera latched the ''Ghost'' onto the hull of the freighter and rode back to Lothal.<ref name=\"AFH\" />\n\nBy the time they had arrived, Governor Pryce's forces had captured the Lothal rebel camp. Hera came to Ezra and Ryder's rescue and landed reinforcements in the form of Kallus, Rex, Gregor, and Wolffe. With the help of Hondo, Melch, and Ketsu, Hera used the ''Ghost'' to shoot down several of Pryce's patrol transports. Meanwhile, the remaining Imperial forces on the ground were overwhelmed by a pack of Loth-wolves. Following the battle, Hera praised Ezra for his plan but Ezra thanked her for helping them to secure victory.<ref name=\"AFH\" />\n\n====Liberation of Lothal====\n[[File:Lothal_rebels_and_Spectres_inside_the_Dome.jpg|thumb|right|295x295px|Syndulla and the other take the Dome's command center]]\nUsing the captured Governor Pryce, Hera and her rebel comrades managed to infiltrate the Dome in two patrol transports and capture the facility. The rebels then embarked on their plan to expel the Empire from Lothal by using a faux Protocol 13 to order Imperial forces to evacuate aboard the Dome, which turned out to be a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]]. With the help of Ryder, this ploy worked. Before they could launch the Dome into space, Thrawn returned and bombarded the city in order to force Ezra to surrender.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\nDespite Hera's objections, Ezra departed aboard a patrol transport to confront Thrawn and the Emperor aboard the Star Destroyer ''Chimaera''. In Ezra's absence, Hera supported Sabine's plans to send rebel teams to restart the northern and southern shield generators. Despite resistance from Imperial forces led by Rukh and the death of Gregor, the rebels succeeded in achieving their objectives and managed to restart the Dome's shield generators; shielding Capital City from Thrawn's second orbital wave.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\n[[File:PurrgilFleet-FRaF.png|thumb|left|287x287px|Purrgils attack the seventh fleet]]\nEzra then had a swarm of purrgils attack the ''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers and jump Thrawn's Star Destroyer to hyperspace. Despite Hera's orders that Ezra leave, the Jedi Padawan insisted on seeing things through and departed with Thrawn, the ''Chimaera'', and the purrgil into uncharted space. With no heavy resistance, Hera and the others would launch and destroy the command dome, thus liberating Lothal in the process.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\nFollowing a gun battle with Pryce's stormtroopers, Hera and her rebel fighters escaped aboard the ''Ghost'' with the help of Wolffe, Mart Mattin, and Cikatro Vizago. After the battle, Chopper played a pre-recorded hologram message by Ezra, in which he told Hera that he had left a meiloorun fruit for her. Ezra then told his fellow Spectres that he looked forward to coming home one day, leaving Hera, Zeb, and Sabine to reflect on Ezra's words.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\nWith the Lothalian people celebrating, Kallus told Hera that the people were with her. General Syndulla responded that if the Empire was looking for a fight, they had one. Despite the rebels' fears, the Empire never returned to Lothal. Sometime afterward, she gave birth to [[Jacen Syndulla]], the son of Kanan Jarrus.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\n====Build up to the Galactic Civil War====\nHera returned to the Alliance after Lothal. After the Alliance learned of the Death Star, Hera was called to the command room at [[Great Temple|Base One]].<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> Shortly after, Hera participated in the [[Battle of Scarif]],<ref name=\"Updated and Expanded\">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> where she flew the ''Ghost'',<ref name=\"Helmet Collection 79\">{{HelmetCollectionCite|79|Highlights of the Saga|The Battle of Scarif}}</ref> and in the time before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Hera vouched for the skills of Antilles as an ace fighter pilot.<ref name=\"Grounded\">{{Shortstory|story=Grounded|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Kidnapped by mercenaries====\n[[File:Hera_Kidnapped.jpg|thumb|352x352px|Hera captured by Aphra.]]\nSometime after the Battle of Yavin, General Syndulla was stationed on the [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|''Lucrehulk''-class Battleship]] ''[[Lucrehulk Prime]]'' which was being used as a flight school by the Rebel Alliance. There she helped train new recruits into [[rebel pilot]]s. However, a group of mercenaries working for the [[Son-tuul Pride]], led by [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Chelli Aphra]], came to the flight school. They were first mistaken for recruits by [[Alliance officer]] [[Bini]], who gave a tour of the ship. As they got to the control center, Aphra's [[Tooka]] ran to the control terminal where Syndulla was and Syndulla killed it. When Syndulla came to them, [[Tam Posla]] said they had a proposal and she realized who they really were.<ref name=\"Aphra 17\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 17|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 17]]</ref>\n\nSyndulla had the group detained for the time being until they managed to disable the shield encasing them in the cell. They did not go out of the cell however, and Syndulla decided to listen to their proposal. But as Posla was about to explain, his subordinate (and soulmate) [[Caysin Bog]] released a number of blasters set to stun out of his compartment. [[Sister Six]] used them to stun all the rebels in the room including Syndulla. They then bound and gagged Syndulla, in addition to placing a gift bow on her head, before fleeing with her captive. Their plan was to use Syndulla as a bargaining chip to get into [[Hivebase-1]], the R&D Headquarters for the [[Tarkin Initiative]]. There they hoped to find the lost memories of Son-tuul Pride's leader [[0-0-0]].<ref name=\"Aphra 17\" />\n\nAs they approached Hivebase-1, Aphra was fixing Bog's diagnostics and Posla told the crew of his hunt for [[Doctor]] [[Cornelius Evazan]]. When he tried to describe how attached he was to the case, Syndulla called him overdramatic. When Posla and Bog talked of a happy ending after they brought justice to Evazan, Syndulla told them there was no happy ending as long as they worked for Aphra and told them the rebellion would have mercy if they let her go. Aphra then revealed she had turned on the tracker on Syndulla's general's plaque. Syndulla was shocked at this and when Sister Six confirmed the ''Lucrehulk Prime''{{'s}} approach, she called Aphra a dreadful woman. The ''Lucrehulk Prime'' arrived and found itself swarmed by the [[scaraphyte]]s surrounding Hivebase-1. The ship's arrival distracted the Imperial defenses and Aphra used it as her chance to get into Hivebase-1. Once on there Posla asked of what they were to do with Syndulla and Aphra said she didn't mind as she had done her part. Syndulla was surprised to hear she wasn't really being handed over and Aphra told her that she was only an excuse to get them into Hivebase-1.<ref name=\"Aphra 18\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 18|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 18]]</ref>\n\nThe group began searching and found a room of frozen rejected prototypes. Aphra admired them deeply and Syndulla was confused as to why. Aphra told Syndulla she was a scientist and liked \"how\" more than \"why.\" She then decided to use a detached cyborg to eavesdrop on the ''Lucrehulk Prime''{{'s}} comm chatter. They heard [[officer]] Bini reporting disaster after disaster until he was knocked unconscious by an Imperial infiltrator on the ship, [[Lieutenant-Inspector]] [[Magna Tolvan]]. Tolvan contacted the command center of Hivebase-1 declaring the ''Lucrehulk Prime'' commandeered by her. Commander [[Yewl]] told her to destroy the ship but Aphra didn't want that to happen and talked over the comm to convince Tolvan otherwise. Tolvan, being close to Aphra, agreed with Aphra used an Imperial protocol to deny Yewl's order but in doing so revealed that Aphra and the others were in the base.<ref name=\"Aphra 18\" />\n\nAround Syndulla and the others, the prototypes defrosted and open fired on them, disabling [[Dek-Nil]]. The others took cover and Aphra demanded that Posla use his weapons to save them but he refused, saying the prototypes had done nothing wrong. Aphra then ordered everyone to go back to their ship and as they began to leave, Syndulla noticed Aphra pressing a button on the cyborg headset. At that moment, Bog turned around and advanced towards the prototypes and as Posla asked what he was doing, he was gunned down. Infuriated, Posla began semi-detaching all of his robotic and cyborg limbs, revealing his complement of weapons. Syndulla asked Aphra what she had done but she butted in and prompted the others to leave as Posla fought the prototypes.<ref name=\"Aphra 18\" />\n\nSyndulla and the remaining of Aphra's crew made it to the core of Hivebase-1 where they began searching the database for 0-0-0's memories. As they did that, Posla returned asking himself why Bog would just run towards the prototypes so impulsively. Syndulla said she had a hypothesis but Aphra told her to shut up. Syndulla then confronted Aphra about how she had programmed Bog to run to his death when she fixed his diagnostics earlier on. Aphra again told her to shut up and had Sister Six give her a gun in case they had company. Syndulla took the gun and pointed it at Aphra. However, she was zapped and the gun fell out her hands. The four turned around to see Commander Yewl with a squad of death troopers and [[Hutt clone trooper]]s. Yewl ordered Syndulla's capture and the deaths of the others<ref name=\"Aphra 18\" /> and his troopers opened fire. Syndulla used Aphra as a human shield as Sister Six returned fire. Posla remained dormant behind a terminal, still traumatized by Bog's death. Aphra gave Syndulla her gun back and she open fired on Yewl and his squad whilst Aphra tampered with the terminal.<ref name=\"Aphra 19\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 19|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 19]]</ref>\n\nAphra began putting her plan into action: When she chased her Tooka to the control center of ''Lucrehulk Prime'', when she first met Syndulla, she had bugged the system. She used this to her advantage and had the ''Lucrehulk Prime'' attach itself to the data core of Hivebase-1. It's tractor beam then pulled the core out and at Aphra's ship, she had a box of shrink frozen Tooka's, the Tooka's escaped and ran around the base. Dek-Nil sprung to life after being disabled earlier on and used a grappling hook to latch onto the data core. The Tooka's then detonated at the same time and blew up Hivebase-1.<ref name=\"Aphra 19\" />\n\nOnce back on ''Lucrehulk Prime'' again, Bini was keen to have Aphra and the others killed. However, Syndulla was very proud of what Aphra had done and she had obtained for them the core of Hivebase-1, which had data that could change the course of the war. She let them leave peacefully and Sister Six decided to stay with the rebellion. Posla told Syndulla that Tolvan was still in the vents before the rest of them set off. Syndulla sent a search party there to find her but the troopers found it was Posla himself and Tolvan had taken his armor. They then began slicing into the data core and found that Aphra had encripted the data and ransomed it.<ref name=\"Aphra 19\" />\n\n====Mission to obtain the decryption codes====\n[[File:SyndullaStarrosHolo-DoctorAphra2016-21.jpg|thumb|left|328x328px|Syndulla talks to Starros]]\nAphra managed to get 0-0-0's memories back to him. However, Tolvan betrayed her and [[Second attack on the Son-tuul Pride|attacked]] the Son-tuul Pride. 0-0-0 escaped and found that Aphra had encrypted his memories as well. Aphra was captured<ref name=\"Aphra 19\" /> and held in [[Accresker Jail]], where she was forced to serve a convict army called the [[Accresker Penal Legion]]. After an [[attack on an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]],<ref name=\"Aphra 20\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 20|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 20]]</ref> Syndulla's people recovered a droid lost during the engagement and found the holo image of Aphra. Desperately needing the decryption codes for the data core, she then contacted [[Sana Starros]] and offered her a job to get Aphra out of jail.<ref name=\"Aphra 21\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 21|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 21]]</ref>\n\nStarros tracked Aphra's convict army to the scene of a [[Unidentified pirate station|pirate station]] that had been crippled of its weapons by three ''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers. As Starros waited for the Accresker Penal Legion to board the space station, she spoke to Syndulla. Syndulla asked Starros what her deal with Aphra was and Starros replied by asking her if she had ever cared about someone so much that it scared her just to think about them. She then described it as a vulnerable chunk of her walking around separate from her body where she can't protect it and that it's hurt then it's because of something that she has said or done. Then she described it further as putting all her weakness in a box and getting used to not watching it all the time until it stabbed her right in the kidney, set fire to her trust, and jumped up and down on it forever. Starros finished explaining it and asked Syndulla if she ever had that and when no reply came, she stated that love was like fireworks and flew her ship towards the pirate station as the battle began.<ref name=\"Aphra 21\" />\n\n====Assembling a fleet====\n{{Quote|Gamma group is good.

She further proposed to go on a mission to rescue the [[king]] and inspire his people to rise against the Empire, to which Mothma agreed.<ref name=\"SW 45\">[[Star Wars (2015) 45|''Star Wars'' (2015) 45]]</ref>\n\nOrgana and her team were successful in inspiring the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]] to [[Mutiny on Mon Cala|rebel]], which obtained the Alliance many [[Star Cruiser]]s that were refitted at Mako-Ta with the help of [[Queen]] [[Trios]] of [[Shu-Torun]].

However, when attempting to jump to hyperspace, the ships' systems failed to respond. Around the same time, [[Death Squadron]] under the command of Vader [[Assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks|arrived]]. The cruisers began scrambling their starfighters, but realized the hanger doors were not opening. The ''[[Executor]]'' then destroyed General [[Vanden Willard]]'s flagship ''[[Yavin's Hope]]''.

A major [[Battle of Endor|battle]] broke out above the moon and on its surface between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. Eventually, the Empire was defeated, the second Death Star destroyed and the Emperor killed. After the battle, Rebels went to celebrate on the moon with the indigenous [[Ewok]]s, who helped win the battle on the surface.<ref name=\"Return of the Jedi\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> Over a period of time, the Ewoks grew hungry and attempted to eat some of the stormtroopers captured on the moon. General Leia Organa wrestled to stop them from doing so and tried to teach them how to treat the enemy fairly, though achieving little results. Organa tasked General [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] to go to [[Syndulla's camp]] and ask Hera for [[ration bar]]s to help feed the hungry Ewoks. The two reluctantly went to Hera, but she would only give him the rations if Solo admitted that the ''Ghost'' was a better ship than the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', which he admitted to. Hera gave them permission to take the rations and left to board her ship. Solo and Chewbacca would come back to General Organa and save the stormtroopers from the Ewoks' hunger.<ref name=\"An Imperial Feast\">{{FOD|An Imperial Feast}}</ref>\n\n====Defending Bright Tree Village====\n[[File:HeraVsTIEs.png|thumb|left|300x300px|Hera engages TIEs in the skies of Endor.]]\nAfter running a [[comm/scan]] of the area, Hera alerted Chopper that Imperial TIEs had been spotted heading toward [[Bright Tree Village]]. Chopper complained about their lack of crew, but Hera subsided the inquiry and continued on with the mission, boarding the ''Ghost''. Ignoring her, Chopper looked to the Ewoks he had been practicing with and decided to bring them along for the mission. The ''Ghost'' took off from the forests of Endor, but was immediately attacked by the surviving TIEs. As the TIEs swung back around, Hera ordered Chopper to get to the guns, who then revealed his new crew of [[Kneesaa]] and another Ewok. Hera was originally reluctant to the idea of letting them man the guns, but eventually relented. As the Ewoks began to fire the guns, the TIEs began to subside and were eventually destroyed by the Ewoks. Returning to the cockpit, Hera complimented the Ewoks and brought them back to their village.<ref name=\"Chopper and Friends\">{{FOD|Chopper and Friends}}</ref>\n\n====Serving the New Republic====\n[[File:HeraSquadrons.png|thumb|right|227x227px|Hera welcoming Vanguard Squadron to the Nadiri Dockyards.]]\nSyndulla eventually joined the [[New Republic]], the successor government to the Rebel Alliance, where she continued to serve as a general, leading [[Barma Battle Group]] from her new flagship ''[[Lodestar]]''. With the Republic on the verge of victory in the Galactic Civil War, Syndulla was approached by [[New Republic Intelligence]] [[Agent]] [[Caern Adan]], who wanted to station his newly assembled [[Alphabet Squadron]] on the ''Lodestar'' so they could [[Hunt for Shadow Wing|track down]] and destroy the [[204th Imperial Fighter Wing]], a mysterious and lethal force of TIE fighters who were exacting bloody and reckless vengeance in the twilight of the Empire's reign. Syndulla agreed so long as she was able to command the squadron, since it was onboard her ship. Adan agreed to help supply intelligence to guide Syndulla's efforts to destroy Shadow Wing.<ref name=\"Alphabet Squadron\" />\n\nAfter Alphabet Squadron's [[mission to Abednedo]] went awry, Syndulla met with the squadron's leader, [[Yrica Quell]], a former Imperial TIE pilot. She told Quell that she could not expect her new comrades to fly like Imperials, and had to embrace the fact that they were creative, improvisational, and needed her to trust them. After giving Quell advice, she assigned the squadron with a supply run to a [[Unidentified moon (Harkrova I)|moon]] of the planet [[Harkrova I]] in the [[Harkrova system]]. Not only was the mission to help resupply Barma Battle Group, but Syndulla intended for the new squadron to grow closer to each other with the experience. Meanwhile, Syndulla continued to lead Barma Battle Group, who took the [[Treinhaus Citadel]] on the planet [[Argai Minor]]. When Alphabet Squadron returned successfully, Syndulla was happy to discover the squadron experienced a phenomena at the [[Unidentified temple (Harkrova system)|temple]] on the planet and had returned with greater trust and belief in each other.<ref name=\"Alphabet Squadron\" />\n\nAt some point, Syndulla welcomed [[Vanguard Squadron]] to the [[Nadiri Dockyards]], which later came under attack from [[Titan Squadron]].<ref name=\"Squadrons\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|The Hera Syndulla?

In the message, Tano informed Draven that Hera had received an Alliance officer's commission in the aftermath of the mission.

As a highly capable pilot and captain, Hera took good care of her ship, as well as her crew.<ref name=\"VG\" /> Upon meeting Ezra, Hera developed a sort of motherly bond with the boy as she had with the other crew members. She was a true believer in the rebel cause and inspired hope in the rest of the crew.

As Lando Calrissian successfully played her crew members off one another to his own ends, Hera caught on to his trickery and put the con-man in his place.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" /> Her skills of deduction proved invaluable when her suspicions of Gall Trayvis allowed her to expose the man as an Imperial agent.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\" /> She also remembered when the Jedi and clones fought in the Clone Wars, at one point being saved from death by them, and encouraged Kanan to trust Captain Rex and put aside his past animosity towards clones.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" />\n\nAs with other Twi'lek females, many considered her attractive, particularly Kanan but also less savory characters as well, including Okadiah Garson,<ref name=\"AND\" /> Azmorigan, and Lando Calrissian.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" /> She knew how to use her natural charm and beauty to her advantage when necessary, as seen when she manipulated the gangster Azmorigan in order to escape his ship.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" /> Due to her negative experiences with the criminals Azmorigan and Hondo, Hera was reluctant to work with them until Hondo convinced her that doing so would benefit the rebellion's interests. She despised their company to the extent that she ordered them to leave the ship once both parties had achieved their objectives.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nDespite her love for Kanan, Hera was deeply committed to the rebel cause. Her pragmatism led her to accede to Ahsoka Tano's advice that they not rescue him in order to avoid exposing the rebellion to the Empire,<ref name=\"Rebel Resolve\" /> and was a key organizer of the early Alliance, whose original goal was to seek a diplomatic solution.<ref name=\"Propaganda\">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref> While Hera was angered that her crew had disobeyed her orders by embarking on a search for Kanan, she was mollified when Ezra revealed that he had a plan.<ref name=\"Rebel Resolve\" /> She also viewed the rebel struggle as a larger galactic-wide struggle that went beyond the planet Lothal.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\" /> Her concern for the galaxy put her at odds with her father, who was solely focused on achieving Ryloth's freedom. Despite their differences, she managed to convince her father and his rebel cell to help her crew to steal an Imperial fighter-carrier.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\n[[File:HeraSyndullaWantedPoster-SWCT.png|thumb|right|220px|Hera's Imperial wanted poster]]\nHera also had a love for flying which resonated well with her leadership aspirations in the rebellion. Due to her role in obtaining a prototype [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing starfighter]], Hera was promoted to Phoenix Leader.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" /> While Hera regarded the space-faring purrgil as a pest for endangering interstellar travel, she came to respect them after the purrgil helped the Spectres to raid a Mining Guild refueling station.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nHera also had a relationship with the astromech droid Chopper which dated back to the Clone Wars. She adopted the droid after rescuing him from a downed Y-wing fighter. Hera cared for Chopper and looked after the outdated astromech droid. She understood [[binary]] and regarded Chopper as an indispensable member of her crew.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" /> While Hera was angry with Chopper for allowing himself to be distracted during a raid on a fuel depot, she was mollified after Chopper and his new-found friend AP-5 helped find the rebellion the site for a new base on the planet Atollon.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nHera was also skilled at undercover work. She could also change her accent in order to conceal her identity. Hera also displayed considerable fortitude and defiance when being interrogated by Grand Admiral Thrawn. Her courage and willingness to infiltrate her former home to recover a family heirloom the Kalikori gained Thrawn's respect. Despite losing the Kalikori to Thrawn, Hera came to realize that her crew and her father were her family and more important than old heirlooms. Hera was willing to let go of the past if it meant furthering the rebel cause.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nCognizant of the Empire's military capabilities, Hera tried unsuccessfully to convince Mart Mattin and his Iron Squadron to accompany them back to the rebel fleet. Later, Hera led a successful mission to rescue Mart from the Empire.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" /> Despite the disillusioned Imperial Agent Kallus' help in obtaining plans for Thrawn's TIE Defender initiative, Hera still distrusted the Imperial. She cautioned her comrades to be careful with him until they could verify his trustworthiness.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nHera also cared for her rebel crew. She displayed maternal instincts when Ezra was tormented by Maul's visions. Hera wanted to abort her recon mission to Lothal but Kanan managed to convince her to proceed with the mission.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" /> Due to her close rapport with Sabine, Hera was privy to Sabine's doubts, fears, and troubled relationship with her family. Knowing that Sabine was a fearsome warrior and strong leader, Hera counseled Kanan not to hold back her training but to let her fully embrace the Darksaber's power.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" /> As a rebel leader, Hera was aware of Saw Gerrera's harsh methods; which caused her not to trust him fully. Still, she regarded him as being better than the Empire.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Geonosis\" />\n\nHera typically spoke in a colloquial [[The galaxy|Galactic]] accent but occasionally reverted to her native Rylothian accent.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" /> Hera was a brave and creative pilot who was willing to undertake difficult challenges including smuggling the rebel leader Mon Mothma through the dangerous Archeon pass. Hera also had a deep respect for Mon Mothma and the two women became friends. Hera respected Mothma for her outspoken criticism of the Empire and her long-term strategic vision for the rebellion. Mothma in return complimented Hera for her willingness to take dangerous risks and courageous leadership.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n[[File:Herra_and_C1-10P_Ally_Pack_art.png|thumb|left|250px|Hera shared a strong bond with Chopper.]]\nHera had a strong bond with Chopper and sought revenge on the Imperial intelligence officers who had reprogrammed her droid into a double agent. This led her to destroy an entire IGV-55 surveillance vessel with all hands aboard. Hera was distraught when she thought that she had lost Chopper and expressed elation when he rebooted.<ref name=\"DAD\" /> Hera was a courageous and skilled military commander who cared for the well-being of the rebellion and had a good working relationship with her fellow commanders Sato and Dodonna. She was not intimidated by Grand Admiral Thrawn and refused to surrender. Hera loved Kanan and pleaded with him to come back safely after his unsuccessful mission to solicit Bendu's help against the Empire.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nAt times, Hera's devotion to the rebellion led her to regard the Spectres as important assets of the Rebel Alliance. She regarded Kanan as her partner and companion.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" /> Hera distrusted Saw Gerrera for his aggressive and violent methods and expressed concern when Saw enlisted Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper on one of his operations.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\" /> Like Ezra, Hera believed the Spectres had a special connection with Lothal and was willing to accept a dangerous mission there. Hera's romantic feelings for Kanan led them to share a passionate embrace while on an undercover mission on Lothal.<ref name=\"Occupation\" />\n\nAs a passionate rebel leader, Hera successfully lobbied for the Rebel Alliance to take out the TIE/D Defender factories on Lothal and to aid the people of Lothal, who were suffering under Imperial oppression.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\" /> Hera's fearlessness and devotion to the rebel cause led her to lead a strike attempt on Lothal's Imperial factories. Hera also cared for her subordinates and was willing to risk capture in order to ensure that her underlings Chopper and Mart Mattin escaped Imperial forces.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" /> Hera's iron resolve and fighting spirit enabled her to hold out against both Governor Pryce and Grand Admiral Thrawn during interrogation. After Kanan rescued her, Hera confided her feelings for Kanan.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\nHera was devastated by the death of her partner Kanan and initially blamed herself. However, Chopper helped her to realize the significance of Kanan's sacrifice. To honor his memory, she attached a piece of his Jedi holocron to her family heirloom, the Kalikori.<ref name=\"DUME\" /> Kanan's death led Hera to be more careful about the lives of her rebel cell members. Though Hera was frightened that the Emperor had taken an interest in the Lothal Jedi Temple, Zeb convinced her to persevere with the mission. Despite Kanan's death, Hera could still sense his comforting presence.<ref name=\"W&D\" />\n\nHera also used her persuasive communications skills to recruit several old friends of Ezra including Gregor, Wolffe, Hondo, Melch, and Ketsu Onyo into helping Ezra to liberate his homeworld of Lothal. Despite her initial misgivings about Hondo, she decided to trust his plan to latch onto an Imperial cargo ship in order to get the ''Ghost'' through the Imperial blockade above Lothal. As a result, Hera came to trust Hondo. After Ezra helped trap Governor Pryce, Hera praised Ezra for his victory. Respecting her as a leader and mother figure, Ezra recognized her and the other rebels' contributions to their victory.<ref name=\"AFH\" />\n\nDuring the Liberation of Lothal, Hera showed leadership and resolve. She endorsed Sabine's plan to send rebel teams to reactivate the shield generators. Hera also respected Ezra's decision to leave and confront Grand Admiral Thrawn alone. Out of respect for Hera's leadership and motherly role, Ezra left a meiloruun fruit for her before departing into uncharted space with Thrawn.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|That was one of your better crashes.''\"<br />\"''Kanan Jarrus, you know I never crash.

[[Simon Kinberg]] and [[Dave Filoni]] also confirmed that Hera and several other characters in the television series were named after historical and Biblical characters in order to give their names a sense of purpose and meaning that would reflect their characters.<ref name=\"What's in a Name\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-rebels-whats-in-a-name|text=''Star Wars Rebels'': What's in a Name?}}</ref>\n\nHera did not speak with a Twi'lek (French) accent until the episode \"[[Homecoming]],\" in the scene where she argues with her father. When she auditioned for the role, Vanessa Marshall read Hera's dialogue with her own accent, before being asked if she could do it in a French accent. Marshall, who is fluent in French, responded she would, but the topic did not come up again, presumably as it was decided it would be hard for viewers to understand. Eventually, Dave Filoni emailed her asking if she ever thought Hera would use a Twi'lek accent if she returned to her homeworld: Marshall replied \"Only if she was angry.\" She later likened it to \"someone from [[Wikipedia:Tennessee|Tennessee]] or [[Wikipedia:Texas|Texas]], or something like that, when they get into an argument with their father, all of a sudden, they're a [[Wikipedia:Southern belle|Southern belle]]. It demonstrates a kind of vulnerability that goes straight to the core of who she is. Even in that moment, she can't undo that accent.
