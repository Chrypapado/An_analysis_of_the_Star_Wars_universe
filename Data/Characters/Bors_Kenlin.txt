Kenlin willingly went with them to the colony [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Halanit]] despite [[Ysanne Isard]]'s, who was currently ruling the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]], threat to kill the family members of those who surrendered. According to Kenlin, Isard would be doing him a favor by killing his [[Bors Kenlin's wife|wife]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kenlin, Bors}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Ysanne Isard's Thyferran regime]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Thyferrans]]"}}}]}}}}
