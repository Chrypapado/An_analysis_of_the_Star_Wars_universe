The [[Foodstuff|food]] [[Ration pack|rations]] on the planet were not adequate so the locals sneak out of the encampments and hunted during the nights. LebJau hunted with [[Grubs]] and others.\n\nAt some point, the group found [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], after [[Gender|her]] [[Starship|ship]] had crashed and her [[escape pod]] landed in the river. As they had no idea who she was, she convinced them she was simply visiting the planet and that instead of turning her over to the Separatists, they should hold her ransom to her family.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> They kept Padme in a \"[[boat]]\" that LebJau was crafting out of scrap, although Padme thought it was \"rough and amateurish\".<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\n===Oga's Cantina===\nWhen [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] traveled to Batuu, LebJau, now going by Nodlia, was a bartender at [[Oga's Cantina]]. He supplied information to the duo.\n\n==Personality and Traits==\nLebJau was kind to Padme, even while holding her for ransom. He apologized for not having bedding for her, and, to her surprise, followed through with supplying her with food.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn: Alliances (audiobook)|''Thrawn: Alliances'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn: Alliances (audiobook)|''Thrawn: Alliances'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fi=Nodlia\n|fr=Nodlia\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
