I always wanted to have human feelings...but I do not! Goodbye!|AZI-3, to Fives|Conspiracy}}\n'''AZI-345211896246498721347''' was a [[medical droid]] who served the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He was known as '''AZI-3''' by the [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC trooper]] \"[[CT-5555|Fives]],\" who felt that numbers were demeaning, and simply as '''AZ''' by [[Omega]]. In [[19 BBY]], AZI-3 struck an unlikely friendship with Fives as the two worked together to investigate a supposed \"[[tumor]]\" that had caused Fives' fellow soldier [[CT-5385|Tup]] to assassinate the [[Jedi General]] [[Tiplar]]. During the course of their investigation, the two discovered that all [[clone trooper]]s had been implanted with [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] for an unknown purpose, which subsequently turned out to be [[Darth Sidious]]'s planned [[Great Jedi Purge]].  Some time later, he had a friendly relationship with [[Omega]], and after the [[Operation on Kamino|destruction of Tipoca City]] by the Empire, escaped the carnage with her and the [[Clone Force 99|Bad Batch]].\n\n==Biography==\n===An unlikely friendship===\nAZI-3 served in the medical facility at [[Kamino]]'s [[Tipoca City]]. He was present for the arrival of \"[[CT-5385|Tup]],\" a [[clone trooper]] who was suffering from a mysterious condition that had caused him to attack and [[Death|kill]] the [[Jedi General]] [[Tiplar]]. AZI-3 was assigned to oversee testing on Fives, who might have been exposed to whatever condition had affected Tup.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AZIWithFives.jpg|thumb|left|250px|AZI-3 with Fives]]\nFives, wanting to help his friend Tup, convinced AZI-3 that, by not helping the patient, he was doing the opposite of what he was programmed to. After convincing AZI-3 to help him, Fives explained to the droid that no clone went by a number these days and his camaraderie with Tup. AZI-3 suggested that they complete a [[level 5 atomic brain scan]] on Tup, but the [[Kaminoan]] doctor [[Nala Se]] refused on the grounds that a post-mortem dissection would yield the proper results.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" /> AZI-3 and Fives were unaware that Nala was trying to conceal the existence of [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] in all [[clone trooper]]s, which was central to [[Darth Sidious]]' [[Order 66]].<ref name=\"Orders\">{{TCW|Orders}}</ref>\n\nContinuing to work with Fives, AZI-3 performed the procedure, eventually conducting a biopsy based on the readings, and discovered a mysterious \"tumor\" inside Tup. It transpired that the tumor was actually a control chip, and when it was removed, Tup died. Shortly, AZI-3 and Fives were corned by Nala Se and Shaak Ti.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" /> Following an argument, Shaak Ti and Nala Se reached an agreement for the \"tumor\" to be transported to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] and then the [[Grand Republic Medical Facility]] for further analysis.<ref name=\"Fugitive\">{{TCW|Fugitive}}</ref>\n\n===Unmasking a conspiracy===\n[[File:AZI-is-sneaky.jpg|thumb|right|250px|AZI-3 and Fives sneak around Kamino]]\nDue to his role in helping Fives to defy his superiors' orders, AZI-3 was sent to have his [[memory wipe]]d in order to purge his knowledge of these chips and their malfunctioning. On the way, AZI-3 casually informed Fives that the clone trooper was to undergo a memory wipe as well and to be reassigned to sanitation duty. Realizing that the Kaminoans were trying to hide a conspiracy, Fives broke free of his captors and fled the medical suite with AZI-3 in tow. The two stole a [[Kaminoan flight pod]] from a [[hangar]] and fled into the skies above [[Tipoca City]].<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\nFives then informed AZI-3 that his plan was to use the flight pod's autopilot to distract the Kaminoan security forces while he and AZI-3 returned to the clone laboratories to continue their investigation into the \"tumors.\" Fives flung AZI-3 into the sea before jumping in as well. AZI-3 then revealed that he could reconfigure his body into an improvised hover mode. AZI-3 and Fives then re-entered Tipoca City through a service hatch. Under Five's orders, AZI-3 lured another clone trooper into the service area so that Fives could knock him unconscious and steal his armor.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\nThe two then made their way to Kamino's [[Genetic Records Hall]], where AZI-3 compared the tumor's DNA to that of the late [[Jango Fett]], who had been the clone troopers' genetic template. The scan confirmed that the \"tumor\" did not match Fett's genotype and that it was an organic chip that had been implanted into Tup. After Nala Se learned of their presence, AZI-3 and Fives escaped Shaak Ti and several clone troopers through a ceiling hatch. While crawling through the service tunnels, AZI-3 speculated that the chip had an unknown purpose. Fives convinced AZI-3 to operate on him in order to investigate whether he too had the implant.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\n[[File:FivesOperation.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fives is operated upon]]\nAfter finding a sterile room, AZI-3 operated on Fives and found a healthy chip inside his head. The two then headed to the [[Tipoca City embryo room|embryo room]]. On the way, they passed through a training room, and AZI-3 tried to distract the Kaminoan instructors by singing. After entering the embryo room, AZI-3 and Fives discovered that all of the clone embryos had been implanted with the chips at the third stage of their development. The two fugitives were soon cornered by Shaak Ti, Nala Se, and several clone troopers. Nala Se wanted to destroy Fives on the grounds that he was an \"aberrant\" clone who was Kaminoan property. However, Shaak Ti insisted that the clones were the property of the Galactic Republic and convinced Nala Se to allow Fives and the chips to be presented to [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], who was secretly Darth Sidious.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\nAZI-3 expressed jubilation that he had helped Fives prove his case to Nala Se and Shaak Ti. He escorted Fives to a transport that took him to the galactic [[capital]], [[Coruscant]].<ref name=\"Fugitive\" /> Despite the efforts of AZI-3 and Fives, Darth Sidious and his [[Sith apprentice]] [[Dooku|Darth Tyranus]] successfully conspired to prevent AZI-3 from revealing the existence of the inhibitor chips to the wider public. The concealed clone inhibitor chips would play an important role in advancing Darth Sidious' [[Great Jedi Purge]] at the end of the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"Orders\" />\n\n===Early Empire===\n====Changes on Kamino====\nSometime before the arrival of [[Clone Force 99]] on [[Kamino]], AZI-3 would form a bond with the modified clone [[Omega]] who, at the time, worked as a lab assistant for the [[Kaminoan]]s.<ref name=\"Aftermath\">{{TBB|Aftermath (episode)|Aftermath}}</ref> Omega regularly assisted the droid by adjusting his boosters for him.<ref name=\"Bounty Lost\">{{TBB|Bounty Lost}}</ref> Soon after the execution of [[Order 66]] and formation of the [[Galactic Empire]], AZI-3 performed medical checks upon [[Echo|CT-1409 \"Echo\"]] after he was knocked out by a [[clone trooper]] during a brawl in the [[Tipoca City cafeteria|mess hall]] on Kamino after the Bad Batch had returned from their [[Conquest of Kaller|mission]] on [[Kaller]]. Echo initially panicked upon waking up in the [[medical bay]], but Omega calmed him down, and AZI-3 informed him that his condition was stable. When the rest of the \"Bad Batch\" arrived, however, the droid worriedly informed them that they were all [[genetically defective clone]]s. [[Wrecker]] was alarmed by the announcement, but the others were already aware of this and did not react, and AZI-3 departed after telling them he would leave them to process their shock.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nLater, AZI-3 entered [[Clone Force 99's barracks]] alongside Omega, who wished to learn more about the squad while they were away on a [[First mission to Onderon|mission]]. AZI-3 urged against their presence in the barracks, until Omega convinced him they were present for research. After being convinced, AZI-3 began digging through Clone Force 99's belongings to find what they were \"researching,\" at one point being scared by a dismembered [[B1-series battle droid]] head. When Omega and AZI-3 attempted to covertly leave the barracks, they were stopped by a [[Imperial shock trooper|shock trooper]] [[Unidentified shock trooper officer|officer]], who attempted to detain Omega. AZI-3 tried to stop the officer, stating that they were official Kaminoan personnel; however, the officer [[stun]]ned AZI-3 and took Omega to the brig. Omega later [[Escape from Kamino|escaped]] Kamino with the Bad Batch.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nAZI-3 was later present while [[CT-9904]] \"Crosshair\" underwent a medical evaluation, overlooking the procedures and seeing that his vitals were all at optimum levels. Greeting the clone, the droid assumed he would be pleased to know the news, but Crosshair simply ordered the droid to leave, which AZI-3 did.<ref name=\"Replacements\">{{TBB|Replacements}}</ref> While a fugitive, Omega was [[Mission on Bracca|captured]] by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]], who had been hired by the Kaminoans. Bane's droid, [[Todo 360]], had been damaged during her capture, and Omega eventually persuaded him to let her fix him, something he had been failing at. After reattaching his [[Limb|leg]], Omega performed a booster adjustment, comparing it to what she had done for AZI-3, before rendering Todo unconscious in her attempt to [[Rescue of Omega|escape]].<ref name=\"Bounty Lost\" />\n\nThe Empire eventually cancelled the Kaminoans' cloning contracts and began [[Operation on Kamino|moving]] all useful personnel, data, and equipment out of Tipoca City. Nala Se was taken into Imperial custody after [[Vice Admiral]] [[Rampart]] discovered she had been preparing to flee the planet with other medical personnel.<ref name=\"War-Mantle\">{{TBB|War-Mantle}}</ref> As part of the operation, the Imperials began deactivating the city's droids en masse, as well as rounding up important scientists and [[Death|killing]] anyone who refused to cooperate. Witnessing this, AZI-3 managed to escape and hide in [[Nala Se's private lab]] underneath the city. He encountered the Bad Batch and Omega there when they [[Rescue of Hunter|infiltrated]] the city via a [[secret landing platform]] connected to the lab, hoping to rescue squad leader [[Hunter]], who had been [[Extraction on Daro|captured]] by the Empire. AZI-3 initially surprised the group, who pointed their weapons at him, but stood down when Omega recognized him. Omega took AZI-3 with them in the rescue. He stayed with Omega when the Batch confronted Crosshair alone, only to fall into his trap. AZI-3 and Omega helped the Batch out by reactivating the training Droids.<ref name=\"Return to Kamino\">{{TBB|Return to Kamino}}</ref>\n\n====Fleeing Tipoca City====\nAfter Imperial Star Destroyers destroyed Tipoca City, sending it to the bottom of the ocean, AZI-3 was able to help Omega free Crosshair from debris before he drowned. When reunited with the others, following Tech's instructions, he cut a hole from the lowest room of the city into the underwater pipe line that would lead them back to the ''[[Havoc Marauder]]''. AZI-3 helped to reactivate the power but ended up short circuiting it when driving away an underwater predator that was attacking the Batch. The pipe ended up leading them back to Nala Se's secret lab, but after some time they were able to come up with the idea of having them placed inside large medical capsules to float to the surface. Crosshair suggested that AZI-3 should guide them, and despite being dangerously low on power, AZI-3 agreed to the plan.<ref name=\"KL\">{{TBB|Kamino Lost}}</ref>\n\nAfter getting in, they set explosives off on the windows to flood the lab. While guiding the capsules around sinking debris and towards the surface, AZI-3 then had to rescue Omega by cutting away heavy debris that led him to lose all of his power. Concluding the task and saving Omega, he shut down and sank into the ocean. Not wanting to lose him, Omega opened her capsule and dived after him, almost drowning herself in the process. However, Crosshair shot a grapple onto AZI-3 and pulled the two up to the surface. When returning to the ''Havoc Marauder'', the powerless AZI-3 was carried by Wrecker into the ship to recharge.<ref name=\"KL\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\nAZI-3 was an [[AZ-series surgical assistant droid]]<ref name=\"TCW:CE\" /> with [[Gender|masculine]] programming. He was an optimistic \"by-the-books\" droid who usually followed protocol. AZI-3 was also a skilled surgeon and was familiar with the computer systems at the Tipoca City cloning facilities.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />  He had an affinity for research assignments, telling [[Omega]] they were his \"favorite.\"<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nAZI-3 deeply cared for his clone-trooper patients. Fives was able to use AZI-3's devotion to his patients to convince the droid to help him investigate a \"tumor\" that was affecting his comrade Tup.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" /> AZI-3 displayed considerable bravery and loyalty to his unlikely friend Fives during the course of their mission. AZI-3's knowledge of the Tipoca City cloning facilities enabled him to help Fives discover that all clone troopers were implanted with inhibitor chips for an unknown purpose,<ref name=\"Fugitive\" /> later revealed to be Order 66.<ref name=\"Orders\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nAZI-3 was a small floating [[medical droid]] with a humanoid head and torso, and several collapsible arms for performing surgery, which also possessed an integrated [[scomp link]] to interface with terminals.<ref name=\"KL\" /> He had [[repulsorlift]]s that allowed him to float.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" /> AZI-3 was equipped with several survival modes, including one that allowed him to act as a miniature [[speeder]].<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAZI-3 first appeared in ''[[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions]]'' episodes \"[[Conspiracy]]\" and \"[[Fugitive]],\" which premiered on the German TV network [[Wikipedia:Super RTL|Super RTL]] on [[February 15]], [[2014]] and were later released in the US and Canada via [[Netflix, Inc.|Netflix]] on [[March 7]], 2014. He was voiced by [[Ben Diskin]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of AZI-345211896246498721347}}\n*{{TCW|Conspiracy}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|Fugitive}}\n*{{TCW|Orders}} {{Flash}}\n*{{TBB|Aftermath (episode)|Aftermath}}\n*{{TBB|Replacements}}\n*{{TBB|Bounty Lost}} {{Mo}}\n*{{TBB|Return to Kamino}}\n*{{TBB|Kamino Lost}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/conspiracy-episode-guide|text=\"Conspiracy\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/fugitive-episode-guide|text=\"Fugitive\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/orders-episode-guide|text=\"Orders\" Episode Guide &ndash; ''The Clone Wars''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|152|A Trip to the Light Side}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Extraordinary Droids]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{SW|url=series/the-bad-batch/aftermath-episode-guide|text=\"Aftermath\" Episode Guide}}\n*{{SW|url=series/the-bad-batch/cut-and-run-episode-guide|text=\"Cut and Run\" Episode Guide}} {{Po}}\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Anakin Skywalker (Star Wars Encyclopedia)|Anakin Skywalker}}\n*{{SW|url=series/the-bad-batch/return-to-kamino-episode-guide|text=\"Return to Kamino\" Episode Guide}}\n*{{SW|url=series/the-bad-batch/kamino-lost-episode-guide|text=\"Kamino Lost\" Episode Guide}}\n*{{Databank|arc-trooper-fives|ARC Trooper Fives|archivedate=20190424013015}}\n*{{Databank|azi-3|AZI-3|archivedate=20210507154542}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=AZ-345211896246498721347#kanon\n|es=AZI-345211896246498721347\n|ja=AZI-345211896246498721347\n|ka=AZI-345211896246498721347\n|pl=AZI-345211896246498721347\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kamino residents]]\n[[Category:Droids with masculine programming]]\n[[Category:Medical droids]]"}}}]}}}}
