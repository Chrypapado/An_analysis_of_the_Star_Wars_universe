She explained to her friend what had happened and asked why he was at the [[spaceport]] and if he wanted to leave Lothal. The urchin explained that he was there selling tickets for a [[Gladiator Night|gladiatorial event]] and that he did not plan on leaving, then the pair said their goodbyes and Krai was called back to the ship by her [[Moreena Krai's father|father]].<ref name=\"EG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I don't understand.
