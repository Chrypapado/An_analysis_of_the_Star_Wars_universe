Two notable slaves under his control were the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] siblings [[Sadelli]] and [[Soolami]]. Just before being shipped off to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], Sadelli escaped, and was escorted back to [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] with a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] sent by [[JillJoo Jab]]. However, Sadelli would not leave the planet without her younger sister, so JillJoo sent the spacer to also free Soolami.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nDue to the interventions of JillJoo and the spacer, Woff B'tar began a trek to [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] to explain the shortage of slaves. When JillJoo learned the whereabouts of Woff, she sent the spacer to kill him. Though he was being escorted by two of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba's]] cronies, the spacer succeeded in killing them.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWoff B'tar was a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who performed a series of quests for JillJoo Jab in Mos Espa had to hunt down and kill Woff B'tar outside the [[City/Legends|city]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:B'tar, Woff}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Trandoshans]]"}}}]}}}}
