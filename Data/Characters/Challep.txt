During this year, he sought to bolster Agamar's planetary defences, in particular the [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] contingencies. He purchased technology of various groups including at least 100 [[Droid starfighter/Legends|Droid starfighters]] from [[Xi Char/Legends|Xi Char]] but also wanted the technology of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]{{'s}} [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighters]] and [[N-X Police Cruiser/Legends|N-X Police Cruisers]]. After, at least, three attempts to purchase the fighters that were all denied by [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Amidala{{'s}}]] [[Naboo Royal Advisory Council/Legends|Advisory Council]], he sought to steal them instead.\n\nTo this end, he found an opportunity by secretly contacting [[Dren Melne]] who spent years being a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] before returning to Naboo, and contracted him to prepare the theft. Soon a [[Hornet-class carrier]] [[Battle at TFP-9|attacked]] [[Station TFP-9]] as part of a \"demonstration\" to see if the fighters are as good as he heard. When the [[Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps/Legends|Royal Space Fighter Corps]] sent 12 Police Cruisers and 2 N-1 Starfighters in response and managed to defeat the first [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] of [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunters]] the second Hornet-class carrier, which had [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sorran]] of the ''[[Velumina]]'', arrived with another squad of Z-95s armed with [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missiles]] and Droid starfighters from the first carrier. Combined with Dren Melne switching sides to engage [[Echo Flight]], it was meant to make the odds so overwhelming to consider the fight foolish to continue.\n\nDespite the overwhelming odds, [[Essara Till/Legends|Essara Till]] in her own N-1, with [[Rhys Dallows]] who was piloting Police Cruiser [[Echo Five]] managed to destroy the first carrier, combined with other losses caused Captain Sorran to kill Dren to cover their tracks. Challep would later deny any involvement with the attack, although investigations regarding his recent investigations into purchases of fighter technology by [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Sio Bibble/Legends|Sio Bibble]] implied otherwise.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GamerCite|1|The Starfighter Trap}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30c3\u30d7\n}}\n\n[[Category:Agamari]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic governors]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
