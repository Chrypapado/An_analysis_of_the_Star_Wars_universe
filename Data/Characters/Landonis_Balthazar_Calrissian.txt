When it's like that, I don't ''care'' about the odds. ''Bet on it.|Lando Calrissian|Star Wars (2020) 17}}\n'''Landonis Balthazar \"Lando\" Calrissian''', was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[smuggler]], [[gambler]], entrepreneur, and card player who became [[Baron Administrator]] of [[Cloud City]] and, later, a [[general]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. [[Reproduction|Born]] on [[Socorro]], he was the owner of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' before losing it to [[Han Solo]] in a game of [[sabacc]] on [[Numidian Prime]]. After losing the ''Falcon'', Calrissian put an end to his days as a smuggler and became an entrepreneur, setting up a small [[mining]] operation on the [[planet]] [[Lothal]] before eventually becoming the leader of Cloud City in the skies of the planet [[Bespin]].\n\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] arrived on Cloud City to lay a trap for his son, [[Luke Skywalker]]. As part of the trap, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] forced Calrissian into tricking a group of Rebels, including Solo and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], leading them to Vader himself. Though Vader promised to leave Cloud City without an Imperial presence, Calrissian felt the deal had been altered to the point where he could no longer tolerate it. Calrissian alerted his citizens to the [[Galactic Empire]]'s presence and impending occupation and ordered an evacuation. He helped the Rebels try to rescue Solo, who had been [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]], from [[Boba Fett]], but the [[bounty hunter]] escaped.\n\nCalrissian joined the Rebel Alliance and set out to find Solo. After locating him in the [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] on [[Tatooine]], Calrissian aided in his [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]]. The Rebels returned to the fleet, and Calrissian became a general, volunteering to lead the assault on the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]] during the [[Battle of Endor]]. During the battle, he piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' into the battle station's core, firing the shot which destroyed it.\n\nIn the [[Standard year|years]] of peace after the Empire's [[Galactic Concordance|dissolution]], Calrissian started a family and [[Parent|fathered]] a [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian's daughter|daughter]]. However, while she was only an infant, his daughter was kidnapped by the [[First Order]]. Six years later, he embarked on a [[Mission to Pasaana|quest]] to the [[desert]] planet of [[Pasaana]] with Luke Skywalker to find answers about the growing [[Dark side of the Force|darkness]] in [[the Force]], but failed to uncover anything. Seeking to bury the pain of those memories, Calrissian settled on Pasaana and led a solitary lifestyle where he was known as the \"'''Hermit'''\" to the [[Homeworld|native]] [[Aki-Aki]]. He lived alone for some years while keeping contact with the [[Solo family]] and was later asked by Organa's [[Resistance]] for his aid in the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] against the [[First Order]].\n\nIn [[35 ABY]], Lando helped the Resistance and reunited with his old friend, Chewbacca. Calrissian played one more role in the fight for [[The galaxy|galactic]] freedom as he brought an assembled [[Citizens' Fleet]] to reinforce the Resistance at the [[Battle of Exegol|battle]] at [[Exegol]], from which the Resistance emerged victorious.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\n[[File:LandoSolo-Fathead.png|thumb|225x225px|left|Young Lando Calrissian]]\nA member of the tragic [[Calrissian family]],<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" /> Landonis<ref name=\"Solo\" /> Balthazar<ref name=\"TROSVD\" /> Calrissian, otherwise known as \"Lando\" Calrissian, was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Socorro]].<ref name=\"Galactic Explorer's Guide\">''[[Star Wars: The Galactic Explorer's Guide]]''</ref> During [[Gender|his]] youth, he became a [[smuggler]] and a [[gambler]], excelling in a card game known as [[sabacc]].

Lando and L3 was asked by [[Queen]] [[Forsythia Jin]] of Hynestia to deliver an artifact to the Galactic Empire for making up for a [[gherlian fur]] failed delivery. [[Prince]]ss [[Rinetta Gan]] knew about the real purpose of the artifact from her teacher [[Zel Gris]]. It was supposed to function as an energy source and make up for the lack of sunlight on the planet [[Livno III]]. Without it, Livno III would fall to ruin and destruction. Rinetta tried to force Calrissian and L3 to comply with her new orders after sneaking onto the ''Millennium Falcon'' as a stowaway. Her plan failed as Calrissian traveled to [[Neral's moon]] to settle a debt with [[Ne'eda Frip]]. When the exchange went wrong and escaped but he was captured by Queen Forsythia again. Queen Forsythia put Calrissian and L3 in jail. Rinetta freed Calrissian and L3 again. She wanted them to help her return the artifact to Livno III. They all escaped Hynestia and had to defeat Ne'eda's [[starship]]s before making the jump to Livno III. After returning the artifact to Livno III, they put the princess Rinetta back to Hynestia. Queen Forsythia pardoned Calrissian and L3 afterwards.<ref name=\"Lando's Luck\" />\n\n====Freeing slaves====\n{{Quote|So, are you Lando Calrissian?''\"<br>\"''Depends.

Following that operation, Calrissian considered turning the ''Falcon'' into a [[casino]], despite L3's reservations about it. He also started to write the ''[[Calrissian Chronicles]]'' to show the [[galaxy]] his prodigiousness. Calrissian and L3 took the ''Falcon'' to [[Batuv]] where he tried to by a new [[cape]] from [[Borkus (Trandoshan)|Borkus]] until he met the [[bartender]] [[Kristiss]]. She told Calrissian of her [[Petrusian|people's]] plight and status as slaves at the [[Imperial outpost of Kullgroon|Imperial outpost]] on [[Kullgroon]]. Kristiss asked for his help in arming her people for 1,000 [[credit]]s up front. Despite his reservations, Calrissian decided to speak with her and have a drink with her.<ref name=\"Double or Nothing 1\">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 1|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 1]]</ref>\n\nCalrissian was confronted by [[Brushaun]], who believed that he cheated him out of 2,000 credits in a card game on [[Canto Bight]]. Calrissian was saved by Kristiss, who offered him the credits to pay off Brushaun and more if Calrissian helped her people. Calrissian spoke with L3 about this mission and knowing he would be a dead man, Calrissian accepted Kristiss' [[Job on Kullgroon|mission]]. Enroute to Kulgroon, the ''Falcon'' came under attack by several [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. Calrissian and L3 were able to lead the TIEs to a moon, where he was able to pick them off before they arrived at Kullgroon.<ref name=\"Double or Nothing 1\" />\n\n[[File:KullgroonWastelands.jpg|thumb|202x202px|right|Lando arrives at Wastelands Of Kullgroon aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'']]\nCalrissian powered the ''Falcon'' down in order to appear as space junk in order sneak past the Empire. As the ''Falcon'' descended into Kullgroon's [[atmosphere]], he and L3 were able to pilot the ship in to the [[Wastelands Of Kullgroon|wastelands]]. Calrissian, Kristiss, and L3 made their way towards the camp. After Kristiss got herself captured by a pair of stormtroopers, Calrissian considered abandoning the mission but L3 convinced him to stay. He came under attack by some outlaws and starfighters. Calrissian was able to find a abandoned star fighter and attempted to evade them but he was shot down and taken prisoner by the outlaws.<ref name=\"Double or Nothing 2\">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 2|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 2]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lando_fighting_in_arena.jpg|thumb|209x209px|left|Lando about to fight Murkel Kev, Cantor Zain, Kawal Trane, and Siswan in a arena battle.]]\nThe outlaws' leader, [[Batalla]], remembered Calrissian from [[Calladus Festival]], where he took the bulk of the [[Zakku Rain Cartel]]'s credits. Calrissian said it was actually Batalla's prize [[Sharropon]]. He tried to convince Batalla that he was on vacation and was visiting a friend. Batalla considered handing Calrissian over to one of his enemies for a king's ransom and had Calrissian taken to a jail cell. When a droid came with [[Foodstuff|food]], Calrissian was able to trick the droid and disable it. As he made his escape, Calrissian contacted L3 for a pick up. However, L3 was busy looking for Kristiss. He ran into Batalla's outlaws who threw into a arena where he fought against several members of the Zakku Rain Cartel, [[Murkel Kev]], [[Cantor Zain]], [[Kawal Tane]], and [[Siswan]], until L3 and the ''Falcon'' arrived. However, L3 wanted to pick up Kristiss despite Calrissian's protests. The ''Falcon'' came under attack by an indigenous creature, but Calrissian and L3 was able to steer past them. He contacted Kristiss to arrange the weapons drop off before L3 picked up several TIEs closing in on the ''Falcon''.<ref name=\"Double or Nothing 3\">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 3|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lando_leads_Petrusians.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|Lando leads Petrusian slaves against stormtroopers]]\nCalrissian flew the ''Falcon'' low into the wastelands' canyon, hoping to fool the TIEs into believing that the ''Falcon'' had crashed. Calrissian was able to cause a explosion that sealed off the canyon from the TIEs. He took the ''Falcon'' to a sewage expulsion port. As he made his way through the port, Calrissian was confronted by several creatures and shot at them. He was later confronted by the creatures mother, but was able to kill it. Calrissian was able to reach a control station and told L3 to hack into the mainframe to find Kristiss and disable Level 7 to 9's security monitors. Calrissian met up with Kristiss and her father. After rallying the other Petrusians to take arms against the Empire, despite their resistance to warfare, Calrissian and the slave made their escape to the sewage port and met up with the ''Falcon''. After the slaves armed themselves, Calrissian and Kristiss led them against the stormtroopers.<ref name=\"Double or Nothing 4\" />\n\n[[File:L3_and_Lando.jpg|thumb|206x206px|left|Lando fighting alongside L3 on Kullgroon]]\nCalrissian and the Petrusians fought the outpost's stormtroopers. When L3 told him that several TIEs were returning to the outpost, Calrissian believed it was time for him to retreat when the Petrusians were losing their battle. However, Kristis reactivated hundreds of derelict droids to help them win the battle. Calrissian and [[Rythus]] charged the stormtroopers and saved Kristiss from them. He and Kristiss used a cord to swing over the stormtroopers. He met up with L3 and saw the stormtroopers taking the ''Falcon''. After the battle, Calrissian and L3 met up with Kristiss and the slaves as they boarded an [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]]. He accepted a ride from Kristiss and her father, who gave him his payment. Calrissian learned from L3 that the ''Falcon'' was taken and impounded on [[Vandor]]. A week later, Calrissian and L3 found the ''Falcon'' on Vandor. There, he decided to go into early retirement and play sabacc at [[the Lodge]].<ref name=\"Double or Nothing 5\">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 5|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 5]]</ref>\n\n====Coaxium heist====\n{{Quote|Everything you heard about me is true.|Lando Calrissian, to Han Solo|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}\n[[File:ElthreeHanLandoFalcon-Solo.jpg|thumb|215x215px|right|Lando about to play sabacc with Han Solo]]\nDuring Lando's retirement on Vandor,<ref name=\"Double or Nothing 5\" /> [[Qi'ra]], who was an old acquaintance of Lando, and her comrades, [[Tobias Beckett]], [[Han Solo]], and [[Chewbacca]], needed a fast ship in order to steal unrefined [[coaxium]] from the [[Pyke Syndicate|Pykes]] on [[Kessel]] for Vos. Qi'ra suggested they search for Calrissian, and the group found him hustling several bar patrons at sabacc by hiding [[Sylop|a card]] up his sleeve. Solo joined in the game, and the stakes soon became Lando's ''Falcon'' against Solo's [[VCX-100 light freighter]]. Solo produced an impressive hand that caused the other bar patrons to erupt in applause, but Calrissian produced a superior hand by cheating. Calrissian inquired where Solo's ship was, but Qi'ra intervened, explaining the situation. Calrissian agreed to pilot the ''Falcon'' for the heist, in exchange for a 25% cut, negotiated down to 20% by Beckett.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n[[File:ElthreeHanLandoFalcon-Solo.jpg|thumb|220x220px|left|Lando and L3-37 about to jump to lightspeed]]\nAfter jumping to hyperspace, L3-37 plotted a course to Kessel that she implemented after admonishing Calrissian for flirting with Solo instead of flying. On Kessel, Calrissian remained aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' during the [[Raid on Kessel|heist]] and updated his autobiography. When Solo, Qi'ra, Chewbacca, Beckett, and L3 returned with the coaxium, Calrissian helped lay down covering fire against the [[Pyke]]s until L3 was shot. Calrissian attempted to save L3, but was shot in the arm, and it took the efforts of Solo and Chewbacca to save him and L3. Aboard the ''Falcon'', L3 [[Death|died]] in a distraught Calrissian's arms. Due to his injury, Calrissian reluctantly allowed Solo to pilot the ''Falcon'' off Kessel.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\nThe crew encountered an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[blockade]] when departing Kessel, causing Solo to divert his course into the dangerous [[Akkadese Maelstrom|maelstrom]]. Calrissian retrieved L3's central [[processor]] and plugged it into the ''Falcon's'' [[Navigation computer|navicomputer]] in order to plot a course out of the maelstrom, in which navigation was otherwise impossible. The ''Falcon'' crew encountered a massive [[Summa-verminoth|space creature]], and [[Maw Cluster|the Maw]], a powerful [[gravity well]]. Solo launched the ''Falcon's ''escape pod into the [[gravity]] well, causing the creature to follow it and become trapped. The ''Falcon'' became trapped in the gravity well, only escaping when Beckett used a drop of coaxium in order to give the ''Falcon'' the power to escape.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n====Savareen and departure====\n{{Quote|She is a hell of a ship.''\"<br>\"''I hate you.''\"<br>\"''I know.''\"<br>\"''I'm going to be on ''my ship'', in ''my quarters'', waiting for you to bring me ''my share''.

Such a small word. I'm more of a&hellip; galactic entrepreneur.|Lando Calrissian to Hera Syndulla|Idiot's Array (episode)}}\nAfter losing the ''Falcon'', Calrissian put an end to his days as a smuggler. He fancied himself a respectable businessman,<ref name=\"Databank\" /> and referred to himself as a \"galactic entrepreneur.\" At some point Calrissian met a criminal known as [[Azmorigan]], who introduced him to [[Cikatro Vizago]], a [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] who operated on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet of [[Lothal]].<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref> At Azmorigan's reccomendation, Calrissian was hired by Vizago to assist him with recovering one of [[Maz Kanata]]'s treasure troves that was hidden on [[Seylott]]. On the planet, they were confronted by [[Black Sun]] thugs who had it locked down. Calrissian was able to escape with the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'' by claiming he was just hired help and that Vizago and Azmorigan were the brains of the operation. Afterword, he went to a spa to recover and read the book.<ref name=\"SG\">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref>\n\nLater, Calrissian purchased a [[Lando Calrissian's farm|plot of land]] from Vizago on Lothal, on which the former smuggler intended to begin [[mining]] precious [[mineral]]s. In order to do so discreetly, without attracting the attention of the Empire due to Imperial mining regulations, Calrissian planned to acquire [[Lando Calrissian's puffer pig|a]] [[puffer pig]] from Azmorigan; puffer [[pig]]s could smell valuable minerals and could do the same job as twelve mining scanners. He required a ship that could evade the Imperial blockade set up around the planet; Calrissian attempted to smuggle mining equipment onto Lothal but was stopped by the Empire.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\n====Hiring the Spectres====\n{{Quote| Name's Calrissian. Lando Calrissian. Now please, introduce me to my new droid.|Lando Calrissian|Idiot's Array (episode)}}\nCalrissian found such a ship after playing a game of sabacc in [[Jhothal]], a settlement on Lothal. He played the game in [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]], competing against [[Tsoklo]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]], the latter of whom was a [[Lasat]] [[Spectres|crew member]] aboard the ''[[Ghost]]'', a ship operated by a band of rebels on Lothal. Orrelios believed he had the upper hand and bet his crew's [[astromech droid]], [[C1-10P]], but Calrissian beat his hand by using an [[Idiot's Array]]. The [[droid]], nicknamed Chopper, therefore belonged to Calrissian, but he agreed to give the droid back and pay the rebels much-needed credits if they assisted him on an operation&mdash;which, unknown to them, was the acquisition of the puffer pig. The crew was reluctant to trust Calrissian, but they needed the credits and wanted Chopper returned to them, so they agreed; Calrissian spent much of the time using a divide and conquer strategy, trying to play the rebels against each other so he could accomplish his goals. During the trip to rendezvous with Azmorigan, Chopper gave Calrissian a tour of the ship, where he admired the artwork of [[Sabine Wren]], a [[Mandalorian]] [[artist]] and member of the crew. Calrissian used this as part of his strategy, flattering the Mandalorian's work in order to make himself look good.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\n[[File:Lando_on_the_Ghost.png|thumb|223x223px|right|Lando Calrissian aboard the ''Ghost'']]\nOnce the ''Ghost'' arrived at the rendezvous, the ship docked with Azmorigan's vessel, ''[[Merchant One]]''. Calrissian and the crew's leaders, [[Hera Syndulla]] and [[Kanan Jarrus]], boarded ''Merchant One'', and Calrissian told them to follow his lead. Calrissian also hinted that the ship had [[escape pod]]s&mdash;a coded message to Syndulla, whom he intended to hand over to Azmorigan as payment for the puffer pig, and he knew that she would need a way to escape the vessel. Despite Jarrus' protests, Syndulla played along once Calrissian offered her to the crime [[lord]], and Azmorigan gave Calrissian the puffer pig, which was locked in a crate. Calrissian and Jarrus returned to the ''Ghost'', where Calrissian explained that he expected Syndulla to use an escape pod to leave ''Merchant One''&mdash;which she did, returning to the ''Ghost'' and attracting the ire of the crime lord. Once Syndulla was aboard, and had given Calrissian a piece of her mind over the betrayal via a knee to the groin, the ''Ghost'' jumped back into hyperspace, leaving Azmorigan behind them.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\nCalrissian showed the crew the puffer pig and warned them not to let it out of its cage, as it would expand into a larger creature if it was startled. Orrelios and fellow crew member [[Ezra Bridger]] ended up letting it out, and the pig ran throughout the ''Ghost'' before being so startled that its size increased and it became stuck in one of the ship's hallways. This proved potentially problematic once the ''Ghost'' [[Mission to Lando Calrissian's farm|returned]] to Lothal, where they needed to slip through the Imperial blockade; Syndulla, the ship's pilot, was stuck on the other side of the pig, so Jarrus would need to pilot the vessel himself. Calrissian asked Chopper, who only responded to Calrissian's commands, to fix the mechanism that would allow the ''Ghost'' to mask its signature and slip past the blockade. Chopper was able to do so and the ship nearly made it through the blockade, but the pig expanded again, knocking Orrelios into the controls that allowed the ship's signature to remain masked. The Empire detected the ''Ghost'' as a rebel vessel and sent a group of TIE fighters in pursuit, which the ''Ghost'' was able to destroy.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\n[[File:Lando_bids_farewell.png|thumb|202x202px|left|Calrissian bids farewell to the ''Ghost''.]]\nThe crew made their way to the [[Lando Calrissian's farm|farm]] that Calrissian purchased from Vizago, where Calrissian explained that his plan was to use the puffer pig for mining. They were confronted by Azmorigan, however, who had anticipated that Calrissian would return to the land. This led to a shootout between the rebels and Azmorigan's forces, one that ended when Azmorigan threatened to kill Orrelios if they did not hand Calrissian over to him. Syndulla refused, and Chopper&mdash;who stole a crate of [[fuel]] for the ''Ghost'' and returned to the ship&mdash;fired the cannons on the ''Ghost'' at Azmorigan, giving Orrelios a chance to gain an upper hand and hold Azmorigan at gunpoint. Syndulla demanded that the crime lord leave, a demand that he acquiesced to. With Azmorigan gone, Calrissian claimed that he did not have the credits that he owed the rebels, but he did return Chopper to them. Nonetheless, Syndulla held Calrissian in her debt, though what he did not reveal was that he knew Chopper had stolen the fuel, which was why he did not give them any credits. He did, however, believe that he would one [[Standard day|day]] meet the rebels again.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\n====Dealing with the Varluk Organization====\n{{Quote|I have some bad news for you sir. Your puffer pig has been stolen.|W1-LE to Lando Calrissian|Puffer pig}}\n[[File:LandosWillie-SWRM21.jpg|thumb|right|197x197px|Lando finds out his Puffer pig has been stolen by the Varluk Organization.]]\nCalrissian and [[Rikarda]] were traveling to the planet [[Klonoid]], aboard the ''[[Stellar Sun]]''. During the jounrey, his droid [[W1-LE]], who he had left to watch over his puffer pig and the farm, said that the farm was attacked by raiders who stole Calrissian's pig. Calrissian found out it was the [[Varluk Organization]] and asked Rikarda to set [[Rescue of Lando Calrissian's puffer pig|course]] to their [[Varluk Organization headquarters|headquarters]] which was located on [[Zyzar]].<ref name=\"Puffer Problems\">{{SWRMCite|21|Puffer Problems}}</ref>\n\nAfter arriving, Calrissian tried to enter the headquarters through a window but was seen by to patrol men. Calrissian paralyzed and shot the patrol men and changed into one their uniforms. After entering the complex, he discovered all the rooms were empty but eventually found his pig in a cage. When trying to free her, he was captured by more patrol men and was sent to the companies leader, [[Ango Croom]].<ref name=\"Puffer Problems\" />\n\n[[File:Rescue_of_Landos_puffer_pig.png|thumb|219x219px|left|Lando rescuing his puffer pig]]\nCroom explained to Calrissian that he was tired of waiting for him to return his debt, and decided to do it for him, by stealing his pig. Later Calrissian began to pull his pig out of the hands of the patrol men and the pig increased size, throwing the patrol men to the ground. As he was escaping, Calrissian threw a [[hologram]] of locations of raw materials in a room so which the Varluk Organization could find it, which meant Calrissian could pay his debt to the organization. Later beyond the complex, Rikarda picked him up on the ''Stellar Sun'' and they escaped.<ref name=\"Puffer Problems\" />\n\n====Returning a favor====\nCalrissian later came into contact with the rebels again some time later. After the rebels [[Action at Mustafar|destroyed]] the ''[[Sovereign]]'', the personal [[Star Destroyer]] of [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the Imperials tightened security on Lothal. The rebels [[Mission to Lothal (4 BBY)|returned]] to Lothal after having been away from the planet, where they were pursued by numerous Imperial agents: including [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]]. Vader ordered that no ship could leave Lothal, leading the rebels to contact Calrissian to ask for his assistance in smuggling them off-planet. He spoke to them via hologram, as he was not on Lothal, but nonetheless agreed to help them in exchange for three [[49-v99 Deflector|military-grade]] [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]]. With the deal having been made, Calrissian ordered his personal droid, W1-LE, to assist the rebels with the [[masking transponder]]s that would trick the Empire into pursuing false signals from their stolen Imperial [[shuttle]]. The rebels successfully escaped Lothal.<ref name=\"The Siege of Lothal\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>\n\n====Trouble on Tyegin====\n[[File:LandoDLina-OffTheRails.jpg|thumb|208x208px|right|Calrissian and D'Lina aboard the ''Exas Jewell''.]]\nCalrissian later traveled to the planet [[Tyegin]] where he was part of a high-stake sabacc game taking place in the lead car of the ''[[Exas Jewell]]'', a [[luxury train]]. During the time, Calrissian was posing as the [[train]]'s designer, [[Shen Kanton]]. The other players of the game were [[D'Lina]], Prince [[Baj]], and [[Rakan]]. Calrissian eventually made a big win. Calrissian planned to leave the ''Exas Jewel'' before anyone figured out who he really was. However, the other players start to see through his scheme, because Kenton, as the designer of the train, was supposed to ride to the end of the line and host a grand reception. Calrissian attempted to smooth-talk his way out of the situation, but the conversation was interrupted by a sudden explosion at the front of the luxury train.<ref name=\"Off the Rails\">{{SWRMCite||Off the Rails}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lando_aboard_the_Exas_Jewell.jpg|thumb|left|195x195px|Calrissian hears the pirates explosion aboard the ''Exas Jewell''.]]\nA [[pirate]] gang which consisted of [[Zira]], [[Grillo]], and [[Shelvy]] blasted their way through the doors. Shelvy brought the train's conductor, who was an [[Tarsunt]]. Grillo then destroyed the train's controls so it fall off the rails. The three pirates escaped the train on jetpacks with stolen riches. Right before they went, Zira offered Calrissian to come with them but he refused. When the pirates left, the people turned to Calrissian for leadership, still believing he designed the train. They decided to try and unhook the engine. The rest of the train stopped while the engine still went on<ref name=\"Off the Rails\" />\n\nLater, Calrissian ordered the people to grab whatever so they could carry it and take it all toward the train car's open front end in order to disrupt its magnetic field. Baj attempted to dump the train car's [[dealer droid]] out but was stopped by Calrissian told him otherwise. The considerable amount stuff up underneath the front of the train car ended up creating enough drag to slow it down. The big dining train car was still coming fast. It slammed into the back of the other cars. This sent the prince falling forward out of the train car. Calrissian then saving his life. When the ''Exas Jewel'' finally stopped, [[Tyegin's law enforcement]] landed close by and rescued them all.<ref name=\"Off the Rails\" />\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Watching the Battle of Yavin====\n{{Quote|That's... that's my ship. That's the ''Millennium Falcon''.|Lando watches a recording of the battle over the Death Star|The Angle}}\nIn the [[time]] following the [[Battle of Yavin]], which saw the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] destroy the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station]], Calrissian was playing a game of [[klikklak]] with [[Jaff Basan]] in the [[Luck Luck Freidal's casino|illegal casino]] owned by [[Luck Luck Freidal]]. Before the game, which Calrissian was certain he was winning, could end, the Empire raided the casino and shut it down. Traveling to a cantina to reunite with Lobot, Calrissian learned about the Battle of Yavin, watching a [[DarkNet]] recording leaked by the Rebels.<ref name=\"The Angle\" />\n\nTo his surprise, he saw the ''Millennium Falcon'' enter the fight. Asking to watch it again, he was certain the ship was being piloted by Solo. Surprised that Solo was fighting for what he had written off as a lost cause, Calrissian toasted to Solo before asking Lobot to shoot him if he ever tried to do something similar. Calrissian than sat, drinking drinks he could not currently afford and pondering what had made Solo join the Rebels.<ref name=\"The Angle\" />\n\n====Working with Sana Starros====\n{{Quote|Heh.

Calrissian arranged for them to meet with an Imperial officer, where Sana told them that [[Krawg]] [[Krawg pirates|pirates]] had the crates. For more information, she took 20,000 credits, in addition to 5,000 that she received from the pirates for selling them one box.<ref name=\"Star Wars 34\">[[Star Wars (2015) 34|''Star Wars'' (2015) 34]]</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Coruscant, they went to the planet [[Tatooine]], to the [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. There, Starros disowned from the common past with Calrissian and also reported for 20 thousand credits, who had the thirteenth box of weapons. She herself had stolen it from Jabba, but she stated that the Krawg had done it and successfully completion of their transaction.<ref name=\"Star Wars 34\" />\n\nWhen leaving Tatooine, the smugglers were attacked by a ship of Krawg who found out that she had deceived them. Eventually the Empire arrested the pirates and Calrissian and Starros managed to escape. They later traveled to [[Nar Shaddaa]] where they had dinner before Calrissian left.<ref name=\"Star Wars 34\" />\n\n====Deal of a lifetime====\n{{Quote|...I also know who they ''say'' you are. The Fiend of Castell. The Burning Moff. The Imperial Governor of this sector, ''brutal'' in your response to even the slightest challenge to the Empire's authority.|Lando Calrissian to Moff Ssaria|Lando 1}}\n[[File:Orbital_shipyard_cc-24.jpg|left|217x217px|thumb|Lando lead an audacious heist to steal the Emperor's yacht ''Imperialis'']]\nPrior to becoming the [[administrator]] of [[Cloud City]], Calrissian was a self-described opportunist trying to \"make his way\" through an uncaring [[universe]]. Calrissian was able to make a living by illegally acquiring and redistributing rare or valuable goods. However, due to Calrissian's penchant for gambling, he and his business partner Lobot were in deep with the wrong people. After convincing [[Moff]] [[Ssaria]], also known as the \"fiend of [[Castell]],\" into parting with a valuable and expensive trinket, Calrissian rendezvoused with Lobot at a [[cantina]]. After having had a few drinks, Calrissian was informed that Papa [[Toren]], the individual who had loaned him money, was ready to see him. Calrissian sought to square away his debt by handing over the trinket to Toren, but the loan shark rejected to honor their prior arrangement. Instead of clearing the smuggler's debt, Toren offered to lower Calrissian's debt by ten percent.<ref name=\"Lando 1\" />\n\nOutraged by the offer, Calrissian claimed this was not the deal they had agreed upon. Toren argued that if Calrissian had any qualms about the deal, he should take it up with the Imperials, who had taken his property from him in the first place. Toren argued that had Calrissian used the time he had been given to pay off the debt, Calrissian would not be in his current predicament of owing a vast sum of credits, with little-to-no time to pay it off. The loan shark suggested that if the smuggler was sincere and adamant about clearing his debt, he would do so, provided Calrissian agreed to do a job for him. After leaving the cantina, Calrissian and Lobot got into a heated exchange. Angry at the fact that Calrissian had accepted the deal, as well as Toren's gall, Lobot argued that Calrissian should have stood up to Toren. Calrissian countered by explaining that only people with no imagination use [[blaster]]s. If they tried to harm Toren, a [[bounty]] would be placed on their heads, adding to their current troubles.<ref name=\"Lando 1\" />\n\nInstead of using violence to accept the deal, Calrissian insisted that the job would be quick. It would not only clear their debt but would also put them ahead. Although Lobot was concerned about their chosen dangerous lifestyle, Calrissian promised his friend that they would no longer accept high stakes work after completing the job. Having acquired the services of [[Aleksin]] and [[Pavol]], in case the plan required the use of force, Calrissian and Lobot went to speak to [[Sava]] [[Korin Pers]], a former [[antiques dealer]] and [[professor]]. Calrissian attempted to make good on a promise to Korin, to pay her back for the loss of the woman's eye. Korin argued that she could not think of a reason why she would ever work with Calrissian again, until she saw Toren's plan and what they were going to steal. According to the plan, Calrissian and company were to steal a pleasure craft being refitted at [[Sienar Fleet Systems]] [[Orbital Shipyard CC-24]].<ref name=\"Lando 1\" />\n\nAdhering to Toren's plan, Calrissian and his crew donned [[stealth suit]]s and [[Theft of the Imperialis|infiltrated]] the [[shipyard]]. They managed to overpower the [[stormtrooper]] sentries and escape in the stolen ship. After taking off, Calrissian and Lobot discussed the fact that the ship that they had stolen seemed to be fairly advanced, specially modified. Lobot asked whether his friend could activate the [[hyperdrive]]. Calrissian, however, assured Lobot that he could do so only after the ship escaped the planet's gravity well. Unknown to Calrissian and his crew, they had stolen the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine's]] personal luxury [[yacht]], ''[[Imperialis]]''.<ref name=\"Lando 1\" />\n\n====Imperial entanglements====\n[[File:Lando_and_Lobot_escape_Castell.png|right|241x241px|thumb|Lando and Lobot aboard the ''Imperialis'']]\nBefore they could jump into hyperspace, Calrissian and Lobot found their path blocked by three [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyers]]. Calrissian was surprised that the Empire would dispatch such resources and realized that the ship was worth a lot. After the Imperial [[commander]] [[Commodore]] [[Idel]] destroyed Shipyard CC-24 for failing to respect the Emperor's property, he deployed a pair of [[gravity mine]]s to disable the yacht. However, the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} advanced automated defenses incinerated the bombs. An amazed Calrissian then instructed Lobot to power up the hyperdrive.<ref name=\"Lando 2\">[[Lando 2|''Lando'' 2]]</ref>\n\nKorin then confronted Calrissian and asked what he had gotten them into. Based on the fact that the Imperials had deployed gravity [[mine]]s, Calrissian deduced that the Empire wanted to capture them because there was something irreplaceable and priceless aboard the ship. When two of the Star Destroyers trapped the ''Imperialis'' in their tractor beams, Calrissian devised a trick escape maneuver. He got Lobot to feed the coordinates of the tractor beams into his piloting [[computer]]. Lobot and Aleksin were skeptical about Calrissian's plan to fly into the beams but Korin convinced the others to trust him. Flying the ''Imperialis'', Calrissian locked [[Captain]] [[Conro]]'s [[Conro's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer's]] tractor beam onto Captain [[Shan]]'s [[Shan's Star Destroyer|ship]]. This collision damaged the two Star Destroyers, allowing Calrissian and his crew to flee into deep space.<ref name=\"Lando 2\" />\n\nAfter escaping the Star Destroyers, Lobot thanked Calrissian for his dangerous maneuver. Calrissian then proposed to Korin that they divide the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} treasures among themselves and give the ship to Toren. When Calrissian asked Korin what they stole, she replied that the ship was full of treasure. After touring the ship's hallways, they reached the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} central chamber. Lobot managed to access the chamber with his [[AJ^6 cyborg construct|cybernetic headset]] but was impaled in the gut by a pair of [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Royal Guards]].<ref name=\"Lando 2\" />\n\nAs Lobot succumbed to his injuries, his [[Cybernetics|implants]] began to take over his mind. With Korin's help, Calrissian brought the wounded Lobot to the ship's [[medical bay]] while Aleksin and Pavol fought the Royal Guards with [[Knife|knives]].<ref name=\"Lando 3\">[[Lando 3|''Lando'' 3]]</ref> Meanwhile, the Emperor dispatched the [[bounty hunter]] [[Chanath Cha]] to recover his ship.<ref name=\"Lando 2\" /> He supplied her with the modified [[Star Courier]] ''[[Scimitar]]'', which was capable of tracking the hyperspace signature of starships. While Lobot recuperated inside a [[bacta tank]], Korin told Calrissian that they had encountered Imperial Royal Guards. Based on the ship's opulent treasures and the Royal Guard's presence, Korin deduced that the stolen ship belonged to the Emperor himself.<ref name=\"Lando 3\" />\n\nCalrissian was unwilling to listen to Korin's admonition and told him they were going to help the [[twin]]s. Calrissian and Korin found an armory and helped themselves to some blasters. When they returned to the central chamber, they discovered that Aleksin and Pavol had killed the Royal Guards. While Calrissian complimented the twins, Korin discovered that the guards had mysteriously been corrupted by [[Dark side of the Force|something]] in the valuable chamber. Calrissian and his companions discovered that the central chamber stored several [[Sith artifact]]s including the ancient [[mask of Lord Momin]]. Not realizing the danger, Calrissian quipped that the treasures they found could make up for Korin's lost eye.<ref name=\"Lando 3\" />\n\n====Fall of the Sith====\n[[File:Chanath_Cha_face.png|left|175x175px|thumb|Chanath Cha, a familiar face from Lando and Lobot's past]]\nWhen Calrissian asked how much the treasures in the central chamber were worth, Korin recognized that these artifacts belonged to the ancient [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Momin]], a [[Sith]] [[sculptor]] whose works were believed to be lost. While Calrissian and Korin discussed their plans to sell the merchandise, Aleksin gazed into the Sith helmet. He grabbed a [[double-bladed lightsaber]] and [[Dismemberment|sliced off]] his twin Pavol's lower right arm. Taken by surprise, Calrissian and Korin managed to exit the central chamber and seal the door. However, Pavol was left inside with the corrupted Aleksin.<ref name=\"Lando 4\">[[Lando 4|''Lando'' 4]]</ref>\n\nIgnorant of the Sith and their history, Calrissian believed that Aleksin had double-crossed them. However, Korin speculated that Aleksin had been corrupted by the Sith artifacts, based on her research into Sith lore at the [[University of Bar'leth]]. She deduced that the Royal Guards had been corrupted by their proximity to the Sith objects in the central chamber. Calrissian complimented Korin for being a \"fascinating\" lady but dismissed the [[Jedi]] and Sith as superstition. All that he was concerned about was that one of his team members had gone nuts and chopped off the arm of his companion. Calrissian also wanted to get back into the chamber and help Pavol.<ref name=\"Lando 4\" />\n\nKorin replied that she was leaving the ship in an escape pod and marveled that Calrissian cared for others for a change. Unknown to Calrissian and his companions, Cha had infiltrated the ship. She was a former romantic interest of Lobot. When Calrissian objected to leaving Pavol behind, Korin warned him not to underestimate the powers of the Sith. Calrissian refused to leave his friend Lobot behind. Before the argument could escalate, the two heard over the intercom that the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} escape pods had been disabled.<ref name=\"Lando 4\" />\n\nDespite Calrissian's objections, Korin headed to the bridge to reactivate the escape pods. However, she was held at gunpoint by Cha, who had disabled the escape pods. Calrissian went to confront the intruder only to discover that it was Cha. After embracing, Cha chastised Calrissian for stealing the Emperor's yacht. She recounted that the Emperor had sent her to kill whoever took his ship. If she was unable to do that, he had instructed her to destroy the ship. Cha warned Calrissian that the only cargo that the ''Imperialis'' carried was death.<ref name=\"Lando 4\" />\n\n====Escaping the ''Imperialis''====\n[[File:Lobot_Lando_and_Chanath.png|right|217x217px|thumb|Lando, Lobot, and Chanath aboard the ''Imperialis'']]\nRecalling the Emperor's orders to kill the intruders or to destroy the ship, Cha opted to follow the second option since she was unwilling to hurt her former friend. Calrissian tried to reason with her but she pulled out her blaster and warned him that plans get people killed. Calrissian then tried to enlist Cha's help in dealing with Aleksin. He also suggested letting Korin and him escape in a few escape pods with some choice items while she destroyed the ship. Cha rejected that offer on the grounds that Palpatine would notice any choice items turning up on the [[black market]]. Unwilling to risk trouble with the Empire, Cha insisted on proceeding with her plan. However, she agree to ferry Calrissian and Korin to anywhere they wanted with her ship.<ref name=\"Lando 5\">[[Lando 5|''Lando'' 5]]</ref>\n\nCalrissian then mentioned that he could not risk bringing his friend Lobot out of the [[bacta]] tank to avoid the danger of the implants taking over his mind. He reminded Cha that she once had a relationship with Lobot. Cha reluctantly agreed to help. However, they were then cornered by the corrupted Aleksin and Pavol, who were under the influence of Sith objects. Aleksin demanded that they leave \"his\" ship or he would kill them. Calrissian objected on the grounds that the heist had been his idea. Aleksin then appealed to Korin and offered to share their treasures with her. Korin stared into the Sith helmet and was corrupted. She volunteered to join forces with Aleksin and Pavol. However, Aleksin killed her with his double-bladed [[lightsaber]].<ref name=\"Lando 5\" />\n\nCha manged to shoot the door panel shut and initiate the [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct countdown]]. She then instructed Calrissian to retrieve Lobot from the medical bay while she docked her ship. Calrissian managed to helped Lobot out of the bacta tank. Before they could head to the [[airlock]], they were cornered by a lightsaber-wielding Aleksin. Using his smooth talk, Calrissian managed to trick Aleksin into deactivating his lightsaber before shooting him dead. They then joined Cha at the airlock. Despite killing Pavol, the three encountered a new predicament. The ''Scimitar''{{'s}} droid steward [[O-66]] had abandoned Cha after learning that she had activated the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} self-destruct mechanism.<ref name=\"Lando 5\" />\n\nWhen all seemed lost, Lobot volunteered to connect his [[cyborg]] unit to an interface. Despite struggling and losing in his fight against the implants, Lobot managed to override the control codes. Calrissian and Lobot left in one escape pod while Cha left in the other. After escaping the ''Imperialis'', Calrissian listened as Lobot advised Calrissian to use his charm and skills to find something bigger to believe in other than himself. He also counselled Calrissian to use his talents for good.<ref name=\"Lando 5\" />\n\n====Business success====\n{{Quote|A mining colony?''\"<br>\"''Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

As payment, Clariah offered to return one of Calrissian's beloved capes. However, Calrissian refused and wanted to run his business. However, Calrissian agreed to take Jiany under his wing.

When their speeder gave out, Calrissian spoke with Askroh about returning his brooch. Askroh decided to toss them over them, and realized that Jiandy had a secret compartment on his belt. He sold Jiandy out, but Calrissian was able to convince Askroh not to throw Jiandy over. As Jiandy ran, he told Calrissian that he never wanted to see him again.

Vader intended to use Solo&mdash;as well as fellow Rebel Alliance members Princess [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and Chewbacca, who were also aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''&mdash;to lure Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, into a trap. Vader knew that if Skywalker thought his friends were in trouble, he would attempt to rescue them and fall into Vader's trap. In an effort to hide from the Empire, Solo suggested that they make their way to Cloud City and seek help from Calrissian. While en route to Bespin, the ''Falcon'' was tracked by bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], who had been employed by Vader to find the ''Falcon''.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Vader and Fett arrived on Cloud City before the ''Falcon'', and the Dark Lord of the Sith told Calrissian to help trap the Rebels or Cloud City would face the wrath of the Empire. Knowing full well that Lord Vader would certainly carry out that threat if he refused, Calrissian agreed to Vader's demands, while bargaining for as lenient a treatment for Solo and company as possible, and awaited the Rebels' arrival.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nCalrissian then summoned for Cloud City's [[Executive Chef]], [[Torro Sbazzle]] to her kitchen. Although it was the middle of the day and outside of her negotiated work hours, he pleaded with Sbazzle to cook for his new guests. Sbazzle, irritated, was ready to refuse until Calrissian and [[Gersolik]], Sbazzle's [[sous-chef]], explained that their \"guests\" were none other than the Empire and Lord Vader, and Calrissian elaborated that the meal was only for the sake of appearances. When Sbazzle asked how long she had to cook the meal, Calrissian informed her she had only an hour, prompting her to eject the Baron Administrator from the kitchen before beginning her work.<ref name=\"But What Does He Eat?\">{{Shortstory|story=But What Does He Eat?|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lando13.jpg|thumb|238x238px|right|Calrissian arrives to greet Solo.]]\nThe ''Millennium Falcon'' arrived at Cloud City and was granted permission from the city authorities to land. Once it landed, Calrissian personally greeted Solo and the others on the [[Platform 327|landing platform]] with Lobot and a full complement of the [[Bespin Wing Guard]] in tow. When Calrissian first approached, he feigned anger for actions Solo committed in their previous encounters. He quickly dropped the facade, however, and greeted his old friend with affection, telling Solo it was very good to see him again. Calrissian asked what brought Solo to Cloud City and the smuggler told him that they needed to repair the ''Falcon''. Calrissian briefly referred to it as his own ship, asking what Solo did to damage it, but Solo reminded him that he won it from Calrissian fair and square. Calrissian then noticed Organa and introduced himself, using his charms to personally welcome her to Cloud City.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nWhile the Rebels settled into an apartment on Cloud City, Calrissian ordered his workers to begin fixing the hyperdrive on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> He went with the workers and inspected the ''Falcon'', making his way to the cockpit. Calrissian, missing L3-37, his former droid companion, saluted the copilot seat she once occupied.

He also found that their [[protocol droid]], [[C-3PO]], had been mysteriously damaged and blown into several pieces, which piqued the suspicions of the Rebels. Nonetheless, after he asked them to join him for refreshments, they followed Calrissian throughout the facility, where he told them about the mining operations and how the Empire and the Mining Guild had no presence on Cloud City. Upon arrival at<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> the [[Rinetta dining room]],<ref name=\"Fake It Till You Make It\">{{Shortstory|story=Fake It Till You Make It|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> Calrissian told them that he had made a deal to keep the Empire off of Cloud City, and he opened the door to reveal Vader and Fett; Fett intended to take Solo to Jabba to claim a bounty on the smuggler's head. Vader quickly subdued Solo who attempted to shoot him, even as a squad of stormtroopers appeared behind the Rebels to prevent their escape. As a result, the Rebels were successfully captured by the Empire.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n[[File:BobaVaderLando.jpg|thumb|225x225px|left|Calrissian grows increasingly concerned about his deal with the Dark Lord.]]\nThe Rebels were taken into custody, and Solo was [[torture]]d by the Empire; as intended by Vader, the torture was seen by Skywalker in a [[Force vision|vision]], who rushed to Cloud City to save his friends. Calrissian waited outside of the torture chamber where he heard Solo's screams, disgusted with the evil he has been forced to collaborate with, and spoke with the Dark Lord once Vader emerged from the chamber. Vader told him that Organa and Chewbacca could never leave Cloud City, to which Calrissian protested, as neither that nor helping Fett were part of their arrangement. Vader threatened to leave an [[Imperial Garrison (Cloud City)|Imperial garrison]] on Cloud City if Calrissian did not cooperate, which made Calrissian realize that the deal was getting worse and that Vader would not uphold his promises. After Solo's torture ended, Calrissian spoke to his old friend, Organa, and Chewbacca, and told them that the princess and Chewbacca would have to remain on Cloud City. He also told them that Vader was not interested in them, but rather he was using them to bait someone named Skywalker to Cloud City, for which he received a slug to the face from an enraged Solo.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nLater, Vader determined that he would use the Cloud City [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freeze chamber|chamber]] to freeze Skywalker in [[carbonite]] so he could be delivered to the Emperor. To ensure that Skywalker would not be damaged, Vader decided to test the carbon-freezing on Solo. Calrissian protested, believing that the carbon-freezing would kill Solo. Nonetheless, Vader moved forward with the test. When Solo and the other Rebels arrived, Calrissian informed Solo of what was about to happen to him. Calrissian monitored the freezing and, when it was completed, checked on Solo's lifesigns, where he found that Solo was alive and in perfect carbonite hibernation. Vader then ordered Calrissian to bring Organa and Chewbacca to the Dark Lord's vessel, once again altering the deal he had made with the Baron Administrator. Knowing now that Sith Lord has no intention of keeping to his bargain, Calrissian secretly signaled to [[Lobot]] to put his contingency plan into action.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n=====Change of heart and escape=====\n{{Quote|Attention.

While en route, they encountered Skywalker, who exchanged fire with the Imperials before the stormtroopers led Calrissian and the Rebels away. The Imperials were soon [[Escape from Cloud City|surrounded]] by Cloud City security forces, led by Lobot, and disarmed. Calrissian freed the Rebels from their [[Stuncuffs|restraints]] while trying explain that he intended to leave the city while helping the Rebels escape as well, at which point Chewbacca attacked him, grabbing his neck and choking him for his betrayal. Struggling to stop the enraged [[Wookiee]] from crushing his windpipe, Calrissian gasped out that there was still time to save Solo from the bounty hunter, who was taking him to the [[East Platform]]. The Rebels let Calrissian go, and he followed them towards the platform. They arrived in time to watch Fett's ship, ''[[Slave I]]'', take off. Though they attempted to fire at it with blasters, it had no impact and the bounty hunter escaped with Solo.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n[[File:Lando_covering_fire.png|thumb|237x237px|left|Calrissian provides covering fire for the Rebels' escape.]]\nStormtroopers soon arrived on the platform, forcing Calrissian and the Rebels to fight through them and escape. They made their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and arrived at its landing platform, only to find a locked door. [[R2-D2]]&mdash;Skywalker's astromech droid, who had rendezvoused with the Rebels&mdash;attempted and failed to open the door. While the droid was working, Calrissian issued a city-wide broadcast warning his citizens of the Imperial presence and impending occupation of Cloud City. He advised everyone to leave Cloud City before more Imperial forces could arrive. Calrissian's announcement created a frenzy of activity, as numerous people fled throughout the city. Calrissian led the Rebels through the commotion towards another doorway, which R2-D2 was able to open while Calrissian and the Rebels fought off more stormtroopers. The group ran towards the ''Falcon'', where Calrissian provided cover fire as the others boarded the ship. Once aboard, the ''Falcon'' lifted off from the platform, pursued by TIE fighters.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nAs the ''Falcon'' was escaping, Skywalker&mdash;who had been injured in and escaped from a lightsaber [[Duel on Cloud City|duel]] with Vader&mdash;communicated to Organa through [[the Force]], calling to her for help as he struggled to hang onto an [[antenna]] at the base of Cloud City. Organa asked Chewbacca, who piloted the ''Falcon'', to turn the ship around so they could save their friend. Calrissian protested because of the TIE fighters, but the Rebels went back anyway to rescue their friend. They found Skywalker hanging from the city and positioned the ship underneath him. Once in position, Calrissian opened a hatch and took a lift to the top of the ship, where Skywalker fell into and Calrissian caught him. With Skywalker on board, the ''Falcon'' took off again from Cloud City, and Calrissian left Skywalker in Organa's care.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nCalrissian took the pilot's seat in the ''Falcon'' and prepared the ship for a jump into hyperspace. When he attempted to make the jump, however, the hyperdrive failed, much to Calrissian's frustration as he was unaware that the Empire had sabotaged the ship. The ''[[Executor]]'', Vader's [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]], approached the vessel, where Vader would once again attempt to capture Skywalker. R2-D2, who learned of the sabotage while communicating with Cloud City's computer, made the necessary repairs to the hyperdrive and the ship was able to jump into hyperspace, successfully escaping from the Empire.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n[[File:Galaxy1.png|thumb|250px|right|Calrissian pilots the ''Falcon'' seeking to find Solo.]]\nThe ''Millennium Falcon'' united with the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet's]] [[Fourth Division]] at [[Rendezvous Point Delta-Three]], but the rebel craft were [[Battle at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three|under attack]] from Imperial Commander [[Ellian Zahra]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref> After the ''Falcon'' and other rebel ships escaped to [[Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine]], Calrissian did not stay long, as he and Chewbacca intended to set out in the ''Millennium Falcon'' to find Solo. Before leaving the [[fleet]], he contacted Organa and Skywalker, promising the princess that he and Chewbacca would find Solo. The group agreed to meet at a rendezvous point on Tatooine, the location of Jabba's Palace.

During his time here, bounty hunters were trying to capture Calrissian. Leia Organa disguised herself as [[Boushh]] to rescue Calrissian. While Calrissian was on the run, he fell off a hill falling into Leia. Eventually Leia revealed herself to Calrissian. They both got up and walked to Leia's escape point. Some bounty hunters then captured Chewbacca and brought him to [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]].

I promise.|Lando Calrissian, to Leia Organa|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\nSome time later, Calrissian and Chewbacca had located Solo's still-frozen body at Jabba's palace on Tatooine. Skywalker put together a plan in which Calrissian, Organa, Chewbacca, the droids, and Skywalker himself would rescue their friend and, if necessary, destroy Jabba the Hutt. Calrissian [[Rescue of Han Solo|infiltrated]] the palace and disguised himself as one of the Hutt's guards. He watched as each member of the Rebel team arrived; the droids arrived first, posing as gifts from Skywalker to Jabba, followed by Organa who posed as a bounty hunter collecting the bounty on Chewbacca, who she brought as her prisoner. Organa later released Solo from carbon-freeze, but they were discovered by Jabba and his court. Solo was placed into a [[prison]] cell with Chewbacca, while Organa became the Hutt's [[Slavery|slave]]. Calrissian remained in disguise throughout the arrivals.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n[[File:All-In-SWL78.png|thumb|left|250px|Calrissian disguised himself as one of Jabba's guards.]]\nSkywalker arrived last and, while declaring himself a [[Jedi Knight]], demanded that Solo and the others be released to him. Jabba refused, and Skywalker was forced to fight and kill [[Pateesa|Jabba's]] [[rancor]] beast. When the rancor failed to kill Skywalker, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca to be killed; the sentence was that they would be fed to the [[sarlacc]] creature in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], where they would be slowly digested over the course of a [[millennium]]. Calrissian, still disguised as a guard, traveled with Jabba and his entourage to the Great Pit of Carkoon, and was stationed aboard the [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|skiff]] on which the prisoners were kept.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:LandoSarlaccROTJ.png|thumb|right|250px|Calrissian hanging over the sarlacc pit in fear.]]\nBefore the Rebels could be executed, R2-D2 revealed he had been concealing [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|Skywalker's lightsaber]]. The Jedi Knight attacked Jabba's guards and Calrissian revealed himself, helping to free the prisoners and fight off the other guards. While doing so, he was knocked from the side of the skiff and fell towards the sarlacc, clinging onto the edge of the pit. Solo, who was partially though temporarily blind as a result of the carbon freezing, was lowered towards Calrissian by Chewbacca. Solo handed him a staff and Calrissian reached for it, but one of the sarlacc's tentacles grabbed his leg. Solo aimed a blaster at the tentacle and, despite Calrissian's concerns over Solo's ability to see his target, fired upon the creature. He hit the tentacle and the sarlacc released Calrissian, allowing Solo to pull him to safety.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nOnce they were aboard, Skywalker and Organa&mdash;who had killed Jabba aboard the Hutt's [[Khetanna|vessel]]&mdash;jumped from Jabba's ship to the skiff. Calrissian piloted the skiff away from Jabba's vessel as it exploded, and the group rescued the droids, who had fallen overboard earlier. With the rescue completed, the group returned to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and left Tatooine.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n====Battle of Endor====\n{{Quote|General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.''\"''<br>''\"''Good luck. You're gonna need it.|Admiral Ackbar and Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n[[File:General_Lando.png|thumb|250x250px|left|Newly appointed general, Lando Calrissian jokes with Han Solo before a rebel briefing aboard Home One.]]\nCalrissian participated in the [[Battle of Taanab]],<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> helping defeat a pirate fleet.<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> He then rendezvoused with the fleet to find that a battle was being prepared to strike a decisive blow against the Empire. The Empire was building a [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], which [[orbit]]ed the [[forest]] [[moon]] of [[Endor]], and the Emperor had personally arrived on the [[Space station|station]] to oversee the final stages of construction. Unknown to the Rebels was that the Emperor had allowed them to learn this information, as he was luring them into a trap in an attempt to destroy them. They believed that the station, which was fully operational, did not yet have use of its primary, [[Superweapon|planet-destroying weapon]]. As such, they put together a plan to destroy the Death Star and kill the Emperor. The plan would require a ground assault to destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|generator]] that powered the shield protecting the Death Star, as well as a [[Navy|naval]] assault against the station itself. Calrissian volunteered to lead the [[starfighter]] attack and was commissioned as a [[general]] of the Rebel Alliance. He attended a Rebel briefing where the plan for the [[Battle of Endor]] was reviewed, and learned that Solo would lead the ground assault, with a [[Endor strike team|team]] that included Organa, Chewbacca, and Skywalker. Solo congratulated Calrissian on his promotion, to which he responded it must have been because of a maneuver he pulled at [[Taanab]]. Solo told Calrissian he could fly the ''Millennium Falcon'' during the battle. Knowing how much the ship meant to his friend, Calrissian promised that he would return her without so much as a scratch.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nSolo and his team departed prior to the fleet, in order to give themselves time to destroy the shield. The Rebel fleet, meanwhile, prepared to leave. Once it was ready, Calrissian and his co-pilot, a [[Sullustan]] named [[Nien Nunb]], flew the ''Falcon'' to the head of the fleet, where all fighter [[squadron]]s were accounted for. [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]], who led the Alliance fleet, gave Calrissian the order to depart for Endor. Once they arrived at Endor, Nunb told Calrissian that the ''Falcon''{{'s}} scanners had been jammed, leading Calrissian to realize that the Empire knew they were coming and that the attack was a trap. As the squadrons approached the Death Star, Calrissian ordered his [[Alliance Military|forces]] to break off the attack, as he knew that the shield was still operational.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Lando7.jpg|thumb|249x249px|right|Calrissian and his co-pilot, Nien Nunb, during the Battle of Endor.]]\nA hidden Imperial fleet revealed itself, and Calrissian and his fighter squadrons were forced to contend with incoming TIE fighters. He led his fighters towards the Imperial fleet in order to draw enemy fire away from the Rebel [[cruiser]]s, and the ''Falcon'' shot a number of the TIE fighters down. He soon saw Imperial Star Destroyers positioned away from the main fighting and was unsure as to why they were hanging back. Calrissian soon found an answer once the Death Star, revealed as operational, fired its [[Superlaser|primary weapon]] and destroyed a [[Liberty|Rebel cruiser]] with a single shot. Ackbar ordered a retreat, but Calrissian convinced him to keep the fleet in place, as he had faith that Solo would complete his mission on the surface. When another [[Nautilian|Star Cruiser]] was atomized by the superweapon, Calrissian told Ackbar to move the rest of the cruisers and engage the Star Destroyers at point-blank range, reasoning that they stood a far better chance against them than the Death Star and that the destroyers would be caught in the blast if the superlaser dared to fire again.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nOn the surface, Solo and his team successfully completed their mission and destroyed the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator|shield generator]]. With the Death Star vulnerable, Ackbar ordered Calrissian and his forces to begin their assault on the battle station. The ''Falcon'' and the fighter squadrons entered an opening on the space station and headed for the [[reactor]] core, all while pursued by TIE fighters. While piloting towards their target, the ''Falcon'' hit a bulkhead on the interior of the Death Star, knocking its [[sensor]] [[Rectenna|dish]] off; Calrissian, as a result, had broken his promise to return the ''Falcon'' to Solo \"without a scratch.\" The Rebels reached the main reactor, where the ''Falcon'' fired the shot that started a chain reaction to destroy the station. Calrissian piloted the ship back through the same route that they entered, as a ball of fire followed close behind. Despite the minor damage, the ''Falcon'' escaped the Death Star just in time and flew back towards the Rebel fleet as the Death Star exploded behind it.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|222x222px|left|Calrissian and his friends celebrate their victory on Endor.]]\nCalrissian and his fellow Rebels made their way to the surface of Endor and regrouped in [[Bright Tree Village]], the home of the [[Ewok]]s who helped Solo and his team destroy the shield generator, where they all celebrated the destruction of the Death Star and the death of the Emperor; during the battle, Skywalker redeemed Vader, who in turn killed the Emperor before succumbing to his own injuries.

Shortly after [[Inferno Squad]]'s surrender, Calrissian discussed matters with the squad leader [[Iden Versio]]. He offered to let them leave free on two X-Wing fighters as well as providing them the option of helping stop the Empire from implementing [[Operation: Cinder]].

Adelhard also claimed that the Empire had won the Battle of Endor and that rumors of the Emperor's death were rebel [[propaganda]]. In response, a resistance movement known as the [[Uprising]] emerged in the sector. Calrissian kept in touch with his old friend Lobot, who relayed messages through the blockade and served as a liaison between Calrissian and members of the Uprising. Unable to intervene directly in the uprising on Cloud City, Calrissian instead transferred credits to the rebels through the auspices of Lobot. He was privy to a joint operation by Lobot and the pirate [[Kars Tal-Korla]] to breach [[Governor Adelhard's chamber|Adelhard's personal quarters]] and capture him.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" /> Though Adelhard evaded capture, the Uprising managed to [[Liberation of Cloud City|liberate]] Bespin as the [[Galactic Civil War]] drew to a close.<ref name=\"Uprising\" />\n\nCalrissian managed to starve [[Ubrik Adelhard's Imperial remnant|Adelhard's Imperial remnant]] into submission. Around the time of the [[Battle of Jakku]], he returned to Cloud City at the head of a ragtag force of Wing Guards and [[New Republic soldier]]s. With Lobot at his side, Calrissian led a mopping-up operation against an Imperial hold-out in the [[Casino Level]]{{'s}} [[Bolo Tanga room]]. As they made their way there, Lobot reminded Calrissian to get Organa and Solo a nuptial gift for their [[Ben Solo|expectant child]]. Calrissian joked about gifting the boy a little cape and mustache so that he could resemble Uncle Lando.<ref name=\"Empire's End\">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>\n\nUpon arriving at the Bolo Tanga room, Calrissian met with the Wing Guard Captain [[Gladstone]], who informed him that the Imperials were holed up inside. While they had broken through to the beam outtake shaft, they were trapped by [[poison]]ous fumes. Calrissian then addressed the Imperials and offered to spare their lives if they surrendered. As a further incentive, he promised to give them a hot meal, a warm bed, and to send them away without fear of New Republic prosecution. After ending his address, Calrissian ordered his [[engineer]]s to unseal the door.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nA dozen Imperials accepted Calrissian's offer and they were taken into custody by the Wing Guard.

After subduing the Imperials, Calrissian chatted with Lobot about the matter of purchasing a nuptial gift. When Calrissian suggested a lamp and a blaster, Lobot opposed the ideas. Calrissian then proposed leaving his Vitiator in a save lock until Organa's son came of age. When Lobot vetoed that, Calrissian then proposed gifting the family a [[Vantillian catamaran]]. Lobot accepted that idea. When Calrissian toyed with the idea of starting his own family, Lobot vetoed that as well.

When Calrissian admitted he had no idea what the Phylanx was, the droid told him the owner of the ''Millennium Falcon'' had stolen it around ten years ago.

After calming down with some [[Corellian whiskey]], Han admitted he knew of the Phylanx from a run he performed with Sana Starros a long time ago. Calrissian convinced Han that he needed to help him find the Phylanx to save Cloud City since it was mostly his fault and the city was in grave danger.
