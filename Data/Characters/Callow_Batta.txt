A [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] friend gave him a [[Wartaki clay pipe]] that he since used to smoke.<ref name=\"AIR\" />\n\nDue to his occasional anti-[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] lectures, the [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] of [[Sanbra sector/Legends|Sanbra sector]] decided to put Batta on \"indefinite leave\" on [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], without giving any official reason.<ref name=\"AIR\" /> His colleague at the University, Professor [[Tem Eliss]], noticed that Batta's departure had caused an uproar at the campus that negatively affected Eliss' own work.<ref name=\"J14\">{{Journal|14|An Extinct Guest}}</ref> The balding professor, although a bit overweight, was still in good health, and considered it a chance to begin a new career.<ref name=\"AIR\" />\n\nHe decided to became a thief, [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] and [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] with some unidentified partners that were believed to be other ex-academics. He raided two [[Galaxy Tours/Legends|Galaxy Tours]] Cruisers (on [[Yuga 2]] and [[Torch Nebula/Legends|Torch sector]]), and many other ships in the [[Alui Corridor]].
