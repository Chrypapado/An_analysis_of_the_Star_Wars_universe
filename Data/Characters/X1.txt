Along with his brother, [[X2]], he was created by the [[Kaminoan/Legends|Kaminoans]] from the [[DNA/Legends|DNA]] of Grey, and grew up in secret on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]]. Following the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], X1 and his brother joined the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] and fought in many battles of the war, helping to train [[Shinie/Legends|young clone troopers]] under the [[Eye/Legends|eye]] of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Ferroda]]. During a [[Battle of Cato Neimoidia (Order 66)|battle]] on the planet [[Cato Neimoidia/Legends|Cato Neimoidia]], however, [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] was enacted, and X1 and his brother were forced to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Ferroda.\n\nAs the new Galactic Empire rose in power, X1 and X2 served in its [[Imperial Military/Legends|military]] ranks as [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]. Following a [[Battle of Dantooine (Imperial Period)|mission]] to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] to kill a fugitive [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], X1 and his brother took separate paths. Not willing to kill innocent people who were harboring their target, X2 defected from the Empire, siding with the Jedi. Following his brother's defection, X1 personally led an attack on Dantooine. He killed the Jedi on the planet&mdash;none other than his genetic \"[[Parent/Legends|father]],\" Falon Grey&mdash;and wounded X2. Although X1 left X2 to die, X2 survived. X1 continued to serve the Imperial Military for many [[Standard year/Legends|years]], playing a minor role in the construction of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]] [[battlestation]] and also gaining some mastery of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], X1 commanded the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Avarice]]''. Inside the [[Starship/Legends|ship]], he met his brother&mdash;who had joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]&mdash;[[Lightsaber duel/Legends|dueled]] him, and fled. After the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] and the death of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], X1 became one of the many Imperial [[Warlord/Legends|warlords]] fighting for control of the shattered Empire. He also proclaimed himself a Sith Lord and operated from [[Bast Castle]] on [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]], the [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]] of the late [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], he also gathered around him a sizable [[X1's faction|military force]], including an [[X1's Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]].\n\nCorrupted by power, X1 began to have dreams of [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] domination, hoping to achieve this by creating a [[X1's clone army|personal clone army]]. He began performing [[Cloning/Legends|cloning]] experiments on the planet [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]] and on the fiery world of [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]], to where X2, now a Jedi Knight in Jedi Master [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[New Jedi Order]], tracked him. Skywalker went ahead to stop him, but X1 captured the Jedi, intending to use his genes for his clone [[Army/Legends|army]] of [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]. Hoping to rescue Skywalker and defeat X1, X2 and the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]&mdash;the Rebel Alliance's successor state&mdash;attacked the planet in a climactic [[Battle of Mustafar (Galactic Civil War)|battle]]. X1 dueled his brother multiple times, first aboard one of his [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]] and then on the surface of the planet. Finally, X1 confronted his brother one last time on a [[Mining/Legends|mining]] platform, and X2 defeated him but refused to strike a final blow. X1 then tried to kill his brother by [[Telekinesis/Legends|manipulating]] his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] with the Force, but X2 evaded the attack, and X1 was [[Shiak|stabbed]] by his own weapon and fell into the planet's boiling [[Magma/Legends|lava]] to his death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Creation===\n{{Quote|The Kamino cloners must have taken my genetic information without my consent.

However, the first training session was abruptly stopped after the discovery of a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederate]] [[Probe droid/Legends|recon droid]] inside the outpost. X1 ordered his brother to destroy the [[Droid/Legends|droid]], and X2 did so. The droid turned out to be a part of a larger droid [[Scout/Legends|reconnaissance]] patrol, which X2 dispatched as well. On X1's orders, X2 took a [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter/Legends|V-wing starfighter]] into [[Realspace/Legends|space]] and destroyed the [[HMP droid gunship/Legends|transport ship]] from which the droids had been deployed.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nX1 realized that an invasion of Tatooine was imminent, and he and X2 began preparing for the ensuing [[Invasion of Tatooine|battle]]. As the Confederacy attacked in full force, X1 and X2 gave support to [[Clone trooper pilot/Legends|clone pilots]] who had been trapped inside a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]]. The Confederacy continued its attack, sending [[OG-9 homing spider droid/Legends|spider walkers]] onto the battlefield. Lacking heavy weapons necessary to destroy the spider droids, X1 and his brother went through a nearby [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] and destroyed [[B1-Series battle droid]]s inside. On the other side of the cantina, X2 was provided with a [[Missile launcher/Legends|rocket launcher]] by one of the clones, with which he managed to take down the [[Walker/Legends|walkers]]. In the meantime, X1 sent in reinforcements, allowing the Republic to gain the upper hand.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nFollowing X1's commands, X2 used an [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]] to take down the [[Deflector shield/Legends|shields]] of a Confederate [[Providence-class carrier/destroyer|''Providence''-class carrier/destroyer]] flying above Tatooine. After clearing the Republic hangar, X1 and his brother took V-wings into space and [[Starfighter combat/Legends|fought]] [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I/Legends|Vulture droid starfighters]] covering the unshielded [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. X1 then sent X2 into the ship's interior in order to sabotage its [[Reactor/Legends|reactor core]] and therefore destroy the vessel, which X2 succeeded in doing.

After ordering a group of clone [[Troop/Legends|troopers]] to get the Chancellor to safety, X1 and X2 joined the battle, taking separate routes through Coruscant's streets. X2 managed to track down the Separatist [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] and even injured him in combat, though he was unable to stop Grievous from kidnapping the Chancellor and transferring him to his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Invisible Hand/Legends|''Invisible Hand'']].<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\nX1 rejoined his brother and they took off into space, taking nearby [[Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter/Legends|ARC-170 starfighters]] and battling Separatist Vulture droids.

As the troops advanced on the citadel, X1 sent his brother to deactivate the [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] from inside the palace.<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\nX2 completed the task, and the droids were shut down. However, a message from Coruscant was then transmitted to the clones.

Ferroda, though initially caught off-guard by the attack, put up a fierce resistance. He wounded X1 and killed most of the clones in the [[Platoon/Legends|platoon]], leaving only X2 to battle him.

X1 also created a [[X1's holocron|holocron]], wherein he kept personal information.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nPreparing to set his plans for [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] domination in motion, X1 took his fleet and journeyed to the fiery world of [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]], where he created [[X1's Fortress|another cloning laboratory]], which he hoped to use to create [[X1's clone army|his own clone army]]. In almost no time, he produced a force of fierce cloned [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] warriors. Soon enough, however, X2 [[Battle of Vjun|raided]] X1's base on Vjun, retrieving Grey's lightsaber and the [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]] and discovering X1's current location.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> At some point between [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]] and [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]]<ref name=\"Death date\" /> Jedi Master [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] went to Mustafar to confront X1, but the latter managed to capture him, intent on using Skywalker as a [[prime clone]] for an entire [[Army/Legends|army]] of [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]].<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\n===Confrontation on Mustafar===\n{{Quote|Enough is enough! The battle lines are drawn&hellip;it is time for the final conflict!|X1|Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron}}\nX2 and his troops soon arrived at Mustafar to rescue Skywalker and defeat X1. A [[Battle of Mustafar (Galactic Civil War)|battle]] began as X1's fleet was attacked by the forces of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], the galactic government that had succeeded the Rebel Alliance. One of X1's Star Destroyers was boarded by X2, who destroyed the ship's reactor core. As soon as he had done this, an enraged X1 arrived in the reactor control room, along with several dark troopers and Royal Guards, and engaged X2 in a duel. As soon as X2 gained the upper hand, X1 retreated aboard his TIE Advanced. X2 followed him, and the two brothers engaged in a dogfight. After receiving some damage, X1 escaped to the surface and sent a swarm of TIE Defenders to cover his retreat. All the while, X1 continued to [[Dun M\u00f6ch/Legends|goad]] X2 into giving in to his anger, trying to seduce his brother to join the dark side.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nX2 defeated the TIE Defenders and joined the ground battle. On the ground, X2 and his [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] were able to capture an ion cannon control bunker, shifting the tide of the battle to the New Republic's advantage and forcing X1 to try to attack his brother from a distance. He sent stormtroopers, as well as dark troopers and [[Hovertank/Legends|hovertanks]], which X2 also defeated before proceeding to the cloning laboratory. X1 ambushed X2 and began another brief duel with him. X1 soon dismissed his brother as an unworthy opponent and retreated, but not before releasing his Wookiee clones to combat X2. X1 waited for his brother in the ion cannon control room, backed by more Emperor's Royal Guards. After X2 killed the Wookiees, he reached X1's location and the two engaged in yet another fight. Soon enough, X1 escaped to a [[Mining/Legends|mining]] platform, but X2 followed him, hoping to stop his brother once and for all.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\n[[File:X1_lava.jpg|thumb|right|250px|X1 falls to his death.]]\nOnce X2 arrived on the platform, the brothers' final duel began. The two fought with lightsabers and various Force powers, but, finally X2 managed to overpower X1. X1 admitted defeat and asked his brother to kill him, but X2 followed the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] and refused to do so. Then, in a final act, X1 levitated his fallen lightsaber and threw it at X2, trying to kill him. The latter jumped over the lightsaber, though, causing X1 to be [[Shiak|impaled]] by his own blade. With the lightsaber falling out of his chest, X1 stepped back over the platform's edge and fell down into a [[Magma/Legends|lava]] river to his death. His army was defeated, and Skywalker was rescued,<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> earning X2 a promotion to Jedi Master.<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> With X2 and the New Republic victorious, X1's dreams of galactic conquest were over.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You should realize that you destroy your enemies when you make peace with them.''\"<br />\"''You should realize you can only make peace after destroying your enemies completely.|Falon Grey and X1 on Dantooine|Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron}}\nFrom the time of his birth on Kamino, X1 was trained to serve in the military, and he developed strong leadership skills,<ref name=\"BF: ES\" /> which were noted by Palpatine during the award ceremony on Coruscant. X1 held great respect for the Supreme Chancellor, and he was certain that he would meet him someday. During the Clone Wars, X1 felt that the Jedi's pacifist views slowed down the war effort, and he believed that the Jedi should use their power to its full extent instead of relying on clone troopers to fight for them. It was during the war that he developed thoughts of an army of cloned Jedi, jokingly telling X2 that this was how the galaxy should be run.<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\nX1's relationship with X2 affected both brothers' lives. While the two were at first very similar in personality, X1 in time developed a taste for power, often acting with authority toward his brother. In contrast to X2, X1 was more inclined to take risks to achieve an objective. Because X1 was born an hour earlier than X2,<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> he referred to X2 as \"little brother\" and used this name as late as the time of their confrontation on Mustafar.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\n[[File:X1-X2Training.jpg|thumb|left|250px|X1 and X2, during the Clone Wars]]\nAfter the rise of the Empire, X1 became even more violent and power-hungry. He strongly supported the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], developed a strong [[Anti-Jedi sentiment/Legends|anti-Jedi sentiment]], and took pride in the murders he committed on behalf of the Emperor. X1 thought that the best way to make peace with one's enemies was to destroy them. During the battle on Dantooine, X1 was ready to kill innocents if it was necessary to enforce the Emperor's will, and he murdered Grey after the latter refused to kill him.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" /> Later, X1 killed Desolation Station's commander in cold [[Blood/Legends|blood]] after he failed to prevent the destruction of the station. X1 was a hypocrite, a fact that he admitted himself. He was also egotistical, keeping a large picture of himself standing over a defeated beast in his office on Dathomir.<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\nX1 was a loyal servant of the Empire during its height, though after the Battle of Endor, he went on to create his own empire as a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Lord/Legends|Lord]], dreaming of galactic domination.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" /> Noticing a large number of stormtroopers guarding X1's base on Dathomir, X2 believed that his brother had become paranoid. Exploring his Force-sensitivity, X1 developed a passion for the dark side, craving to learn its secrets and traveling to Vjun in order to do so. X1 originally had light skin, brown [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Proclaiming himself a Sith, X1 shaved and [[Tattoo/Legends|tattooed]] his head, while his eyes started glowing red as a result of his corruption by the dark side. He fed on anger, which fueled his Force abilities.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> He was also fascinated with chaos as a Sith Lord and believed that the galaxy should be a large battlefield like the clashing lava on Mustafar.<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Bad move, little brother&hellip;You've made me angry. And anger only fuels the power of the dark side!|X1, to X2, during the battle on Mustafar|Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron}}\nHaving been raised as an elite clone trooper, X1, like his brother, developed fighting and leadership skills for use on the battlefield. He and X2 often commanded groups of soldiers in battle, and X1 strategized to bring the Republic to victory.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" /> While fighting, X1 was apt in the use of various weapons. He was a good [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], capable of handling various starfighters.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> As a Force-sensitive, X1 was skilled in various Force powers. Although he was at first ignorant of his origins, X1 became a Dark Side Adept by the time of the Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" />\n\n[[File:X1X2_Duel-over-Mustafar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|X1 uses his lightsaber to duel his brother.]]\nHe gained some proficiency in various forms of telekinesis,<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> as well as in Force lightning, which he used in his duel with X2 over Hoth.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> He was also able to [[Tutaminis|shield]] himself from attacks for a limited amount of time. X1 had a developed Force sense ability, being able to sense his brother's presence on the ''Avarice'',<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> and later feeling a tint of anger in X2 during the battle on Mustafar.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nAfter becoming a Sith Lord, X1 studied many dark side secrets and created his own holocron. He also learned the process of cloning, intending to use this knowledge to create his own army.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" /> X1 showed proficiency with melee weapons, being able to withstand Grey's attacks for some time armed only with a force pike. He was a practitioner of Dun M\u00f6ch, taunting X2 during their duels.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> X1 was also a quick study. He learned to handle Grey's lightsaber despite having no prior knowledge on how to operate such a weapon,<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> and he was able to develop the skill of throwing his lightsaber with the Force. This backfired during his final duel with X2, however, as, when the latter jumped over X1's blade, the weapon returned and impaled X1, killing him.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:X1's_lightsaber.jpg|thumb|left|200px|X1's Sith lightsaber]]\nX1 proved to be apt in the use of various weapons when in combat situations. During the Clone Wars, he used a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]] and a [[Shotgun/Legends|shotgun]], as well as [[Grenade/Legends|grenades]]. X1 was also proficient with melee weapons and used a force pike to ward off an attack by Falon Grey. Following the events on Dantooine, X1 fought with a lightsaber. His first weapon was the one confiscated from Grey in the attack. He later switched to a red-bladed lightsaber.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nX1 also piloted various starfighters during his combat experience. During the Clone Wars, he used V-wings and ARC-170s. He also piloted TIE Fighters and the TIE Advanced x1 craft during the Galactic Civil War. Even aside from combat mat\u00e9riel and spacecraft, X1 possessed a holocron that he made after proclaiming himself a Sith.

In the Clone Wars missions, X1 acts as a comrade and a mentor to the player, giving instructions on what to do and helping in battle. During the mission to Dantooine, X1 becomes the antagonist in the game. X1 is essentially absent during the early Galactic Civil War missions, but during the Battle of Hoth mission, the player duels him on the ''Avarice''. The plotline in the final missions centers around X2 tracking X1 down to Mustafar, ending with the final duel between the two brothers.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" />\n\nX1 is a playable character in the PSP version's Instant Action mode of the game, which lacks a specific storyline. He is available in three skins, depending on the era and planet chosen by the player. Clone trooper X1 is available on Hoth, Imperial X1 is available on Coruscant and [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], and Sith Lord X1 is available on Hoth, Dantooine, as well as on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] and Kashyyyk, though only in the Heroes and Villains mode.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nFree Radical Design, a development company that had been working on the ''Star Wars: Battlefront III'' video game before it was cancelled, has leaked unfinished material indicating that X1 and X2 were originally set to be featured in that game. The storyline, as it appears in the revealed material for ''Battlefront III'' bears a lot of similarity to the final version featured in ''Elite Squadron''.<ref name=\"BF III\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/pictures/leaks-are-here-to-remind-you-about-that-cancelled-free-radical-star-wars-game-w486004/5-w486010|title=Leaks are Here to Remind You About That Cancelled Free Radical 'Star Wars' Game|author=Weber, Rachel|date=2017-06-05|publisher=Rolling Stone|archivedate=20180324125643}}</ref>\n\n===Differences between versions of ''Elite Squadron''===\nBecause the game was released on two handheld platforms, some missions are present in one version but absent in the other. In addition, there are numerous differences between the missions as they are presented in both versions. This article incorporates elements from both versions unless they blatantly contradict each other. In the latter cases, as there has not been any official word on which version is more canonical, the article approaches each inconsistency on a case-by-case basis to create a coherent storyline, choosing the version that focuses more heavily on X1 and better fits story-wise between the events immediately prior to and following the mission in question. The alternative portrayals of the contradictory events are noted below and may actually be the canonical versions.<ref name=\"BF: ES\" />\n\nThe Battle of Tatooine, for example, is described in this article according to the PSP mission. While X1 and X2 train troopers in the PSP mission, they supervise the construction of an outpost in the Nintendo DS version. The two are busy working at the outpost when the Separatist attack begins, and the brothers are initially caught off-guard. They receive a distress call from Ferroda, make their way to an invaded Republic [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]], and clear it from droids. Taking [[BARC speeder/Legends|BARC speeders]] to another base across the [[Desert/Legends|desert]], they rendezvous with Ferroda. Alongside the Jedi, X1 and X2 make their way to the Republic hangar and take ARC-170s into space. There, X2 infiltrates a [[Lucrehulk-class battleship|''Lucrehulk''-class battleship]] instead of a ''Providence''-class destroyer.<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\nAdditionally, the PSP version claims that Tatooine was an \"early\" victory for the Republic,<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> while the Nintendo DS version explicitly provides the 19 BBY date.<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> The Battle of Coruscant is described here as it is portrayed in the Nintendo DS version, as Palpatine's award ceremony is absent in the PSP version. In the latter edition, X1 has a very minor role and only participates in the space battle, flying an ARC-170 starfighter.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nThis article uses the PSP version's storyline to describe the Battle of Cato Neimoidia.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> The Nintendo DS version states that [[Standard month/Legends|months]] have elapsed between the Battle of Coruscant and the brothers' assignment to Cato Neimoidia, while the canonical elapsed time is much shorter. Cato Neimoidia is also protected by an [[Ray shield/Legends|energy shield]], which X1 and X2 take down by destroying several orbital [[Satellite/Legends|satellites]] before proceeding with the ground assault.<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\n[[File:X1_Star_DestroyerMustafar.jpg|thumb|left|220px|X1's Super Star Destroyer is destroyed on Mustafar in the Nintendo DS version of ''Elite Squadron''.]]\nDuring the battle on Dantooine in the Nintendo DS version, after Grey defeats him, X1 pretends to admit that he was wrong and regrets his past actions. When Grey turns his back on him, X1 stabs him in the back with the force pike,<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> instead of killing him with a blaster shot as depicted in the PSP version.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> The Battle of Hoth follows the Nintendo DS portrayal in this article.<ref name=\"ES DS\" /> In the PSP version, X1 uses a blaster rifle instead of Grey's lightsaber. Additionally, the ''Avarice'' is not clearly shown being destroyed.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" />\n\nThe battle on Mustafar is presented here as it is in the PSP version.<ref name=\"ES PSP\" /> In the DS version, all references to the clone army are cut and X1's reason to capture Skywalker is unspecified. Instead, X1 uses reactivated Confederate battle droids left on the planet after the Clone Wars. Another discrepancy is that Mustafar is protected by an energy shield, forcing X2 to crash X1's ''Executor''-class [[Star Dreadnought/Legends|Star Dreadnought]] into the shield to pierce through it and reach the planet's surface.<ref name=\"ES DS\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of X1}}\n*''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWArchive|url=games/videogames/052609news.html|text=This Fall: ''Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron''|archivedate=20090528031}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=X1\n|es=X1\n|it=X1\n|ru=X1\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dark Side Adepts]]\n[[Category:Imperial warlords]]\n[[Category:Mustafar residents]]\n[[Category:Non-Jango Fett clone stormtroopers]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Sith Lords]]"}}}]}}}}
