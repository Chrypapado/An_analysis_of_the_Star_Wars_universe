He and several [[stormtrooper]]s were assaulted by [[Garazeb Orrelios]] when the latter became lost in the streets of Lothal's [[Capital City]]. Rudor then attempted to call for reinforcements, but his request was met with indifference by his commanding officer. Sometime later his [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter]] was defeated by the ''[[Ghost]]'' and found in the fields by local con artist [[Ezra Bridger]], who pretended to try to help him in order to rob him, and sell pieces of the [[Starfighter|ship]] in the [[black market]]. Years later, he was given ownership of [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]] by the Empire after [[Jho]] was arrested during an Imperial raid and executed for [[treason]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Moving to Lothal===\n{{Quote|Now the name Lothal will be synonymous with its famous new resident&mdash;famed pilot, Baron Valen Rudor.

His [[operating number]] was \"LS-607.\"<ref name=\"Entanglement\" /> After establishing factories on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[planet]] [[Lothal]], the ship production company [[Sienar Fleet Systems]] was able to convince Rudor to travel to Lothal and test out products that had been built in Lothal's most productive factories. Rudor's decision to go to Lothal was used by the [[Galactic Empire]] in [[HoloNet News]] [[propaganda]] reports.<ref name=\"HoloNet News\">{{HoloNetNews|post/97905253927/holonet-news-special-report-famed-imperial-pilot|Special Report: Famed Imperial Pilot Moves to Lothal|int=HoloNet News Special Report: Famed Imperial Pilot Moves to Lothal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024111523/http://holonetnews.com/post/97905253927/holonet-news-special-report-famed-imperial-pilot}}</ref>\n\n===Scuffle with Zeb===\n{{Quote|LS-607 requesting reinforcements.

Rudor was briefly knocked out after being tossed across the platform by the [[Lasat]] warrior, but came to once more when a [[blaster]] slid towards him, after it had been knocked out of the hands of a stormtrooper. The TIE pilot regained his footing as Orrelios fought with a small squad of stormtroopers, before pointing the blaster at the Lasat and calling for reinforcements. The Imperial commander who replied questioned how many intruders were on the landing pad, leading Rudor to balk at the question and demand reinforcements. While waiting for other Imperial troops to arrive, Rudor attempted to shoot Orrelios, but the Lasat was able to evade him. Orrelios managed to make it to the top of the TIE fighter, and from there he grabbed Rudor and threw him back across the landing area. The stormtrooper reinforcements arrived shortly thereafter, but their firefight with Orrelios triggered an explosion when their blaster fire hit a fuel leak on the TIE fighter, causing it to explode. Rudor survived the explosion, while Orrelios also managed to escape.<ref name=\"Entanglement\" />\n\n===Encounter with Ezra===\n{{Quote|Hey, don't say thank you or anything.''\"<br />\"''Thank you?

The ''Ghost'' shot Rudor's fighter down, and it crashed outside Capital City while the rebel ship escaped. The crash was witnessed by [[Ezra Bridger]], an orphaned Lothal citizen who lived in a nearby [[LothalNet comm tower E-272|tower]]. When Bridger approached and asked if Rudor was still alive, Rudor reacted angrily to Bridger's presence, telling him to move away from the TIE fighter as it was property of the Empire.<ref name=\"Property Ezra\" />\n\nBridger managed to open the TIE fighter's hatch and jumped into the fighter, pretending to help the pilot while secretly stealing parts from the ship to sell on the [[black market]]. He then stole Rudor's helmet and left the pod. Rudor fired the fighter's laser cannons at Bridger, but the boy was able to use [[the Force]] to evade the blaster fire. Ezra was not yet aware that he was [[Force-sensitive]], and Rudor did not realize there was anything unusual about the boy's dodging skills. Bridger fired back with his [[energy slingshot]] and knocked Rudor unconscious, giving the boy an opportunity to escape unharmed.<ref name=\"Property Ezra\" />\n\n===Trouble with the Spectres===\n{{Quote|There is nowhere to hide.

Looking to settle the score with the Lasat, Rudor targeted Orrelios in his TIE fighter and ordered the troopers to arrest him. But Orrelios leaped onto his fighter and tossed Rudor out, taking it for his own and using it to rescue Bridger.<ref name=\"Fighter Flight\">{{Rebels|Fighter Flight}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Empire Day]] ceremony of 4 BBY in Capital City, Valen Rudor was tasked with flying a prototype [[TIE Advanced v1]] starfighter that was fresh from the factory.

A few [[Standard day|days]] later, Ezra and [[Sabine Wren]], disguised as civilians, entered, searching for the Lothal resistance. When the two rebels came to the bar to get drinks, Rudor found Ezra vaguely familiar from their encounters years before. However, he did not realize who Ezra was. When Ezra and Sabine attempted to leave, Rudor, suspicious, attempted to order their arrest, but the two rebels were quickly extricated by Lothal resistance member [[Jai Kell]], who had been sent to the cantina by [[Ryder Azadi]] to watch for the Spectres. Later, after the Spectres and Jai had escaped into [[Jhothal]]'s sewers via a hatch located in the Pit Stop, Rudor informed [[death trooper]] [[DT-L21]] that he had not known that the hatch was unsealed.<ref name=\"The Occupation\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|And who better to take this beauty on her maiden voyage than one of the best pilots on Lothal &mdash; Baron Valen Rudor.|Minister Maketh Tua, revealing the TIE Advanced v1 on Empire Day.|Empire Day (episode)}}\n[[File:Valen_Rudor_SWA.png|thumb|left|250px|Baron Valen Rudor, Imperial Ace]]\nValen Rudor was a human TIE fighter pilot from Corulag who moved to Lothal during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]].

Rudor regarded the late Jho as a traitor. Rudor also recognized Ezra Bridger but could not remember who exactly the boy was. Rudor later led a hunt for the Spectres and Jai Kell but failed to account for an unsecured hatch in his cantina.
