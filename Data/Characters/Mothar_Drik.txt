Eight [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Clone Wars]], Drik was present at Jelucan's induction ceremony into the [[Galactic Empire]].

One of the other children was [[Ciena Ree]], of the poorer [[First Wavers|first wave]] class. Drik and a few other boys bullied Ree until fellow second-waver [[Thane Kyrell]] came to defend her.
