This is a restricted area! You better tell me what you're doing or I'm going to hit the alarm!.|The receptionist to Revan upon entering the military base|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nA '''Twi'lek receptionist''' in the employ of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Empire]] was posted in the main lobby of the [[Tarisian military base]]. [[Gender/Legends|She]] wore a [[combat suit]].\n\n==Biography==\nThis [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] had worked on the base before the Sith's occupation of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. Once the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] was forced out, it was then converted into the headquarters for the Sith government on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], led by a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Sith Governor]]. She was on post during [[Revan/Legends|Revan's]] intrusion as part of his effort to steal the launch codes that would enable him and his companions to leave the planet.\n\nShe challenged the group at first, threatening to raise the alarm and thus lead to a firefight with [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith troopers]] stationed inside, though after she was persuaded not too, she left peacefully.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nShould the player fail to successfully bribe the receptionist, the player may still opt to threaten her with violence. If the player then decides to not let her go, she will raise the alarm so as to warn the Sith personnel of Revan's presence.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified females]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Sith Empire personnel]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
