He was wanted by the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] because his activities stymied their flow of money. His bounty was worth 5,000 credits, dead or alive. It was claimed by [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]] during the bounty hunter's search for [[Bendix Fust]], a sentient wanted by [[Dug/Legends|Dug]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Sebolto]]. Ballax' removal, whether by death or capture, broke the morale of rioters triggered by [[Zam Wesell/Legends|Zam Wesell]], who also sought Ballax.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ballax#legends\n|es=Ballax\n|ja=\u30d0\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ballax, Shank}}\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
