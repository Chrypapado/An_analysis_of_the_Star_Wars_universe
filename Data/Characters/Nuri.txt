Being a [[Changeling/Legends|Changeling]], he posed as a [[Bimm (furred species)|Bimm]], and charged fees to be a tour guide, then scammed money off his marks while pretending to help them remove it from the bank system. He was able to scam an unfortunate young [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], costing him about 500,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Nuri also confronted Boba on [[Xagobah/Legends|Xagobah]], turning into an [[Arrak snake]] to strangle him, and then a [[Dinko (creature)|Dinko]] to spray a foul smell in order to stun Boba before scuttling off as a [[Fefze beetle]], but Boba caught him and got his revenge by paralyzing him at least temporarily with a [[Xabar]] fungus.\n\nNuri had his finger on the pulse of information, knowing the value of it, and paying good money to have it. He frequently visited the [[Aargau Undercity]] where spies congregated to sell information. He was a rival of [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]], causing him to have a deep hatred of her.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Boba Fett: Maze of Deception]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[CIS Shadowfeed Dispatch 14:4:12 Edition]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Boba Fett: A New Threat]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|111|FAC1, ''The New Face of War''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nuri\n}}\n\n[[Category:Aargau residents]]\n[[Category:Clawdites]]\n[[Category:Confederacy of Independent Systems individuals]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
