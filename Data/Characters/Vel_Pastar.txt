Even if he had began as a child, he would be a \"venerable\" Twi'lek (but not unfathomably old) following the aging table for Twi'leks in ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''</ref>. Like many others within the [[Organization]], Pastar was not fond of the some of the changes which [[Nirama]] instituted when he took over from Riboga, and ended up joining [[the Cell]].\n\nVel Pastar was often found in the haze-filled deepest corner of the [[Hutt's Tail]] [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] on [[Nirama's public asteroid]], and would have [[Kor Pastar|his daughter, Kor,]] bring any new recruits in [[Red Sector]] to meet with him. He would measure the recruits' responses to his questions to see if they might be open to recruitment into the Cell, while himself maintaining an air of being vaguely supportive of Nirama.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[TopWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pastar, Vel}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
