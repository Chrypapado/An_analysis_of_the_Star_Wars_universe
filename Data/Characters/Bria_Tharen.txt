Born to a wealthy [[Tharen family|family]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], Tharen intended to study [[Archaeology/Legends|archaeology]] and pursue a career as a [[Museum/Legends|museum]] curator. When she was seventeen, however, Tharen experienced the [[Exultation]] performed by a [[t'landa Til]] missionary at a religious revival. Drawn in by the Exultation's effects, Tharen sold all her jewelry and booked passage to [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]], where she dedicated her life to the [[Cult of The One and The All|religion's]] service. Tharen spent a year on Ylesia before her religion was exposed as a front for a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]]/[[Slavery/Legends|slaving]] operation by a young [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] named [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].\n\nSolo helped Tharen to escape from Ylesia and the two fell in love. However, Tharen struggled to cope without the Exultation and decided to leave Solo to confront her addiction. Finding a new purpose in life that helped her to eventually overcome her addiction, Tharen joined the fledgling [[Corellian Resistance/Legends|resistance movement]] on Corellia, and devoted herself to fighting against the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and bringing an end to slavery. Tharen worked on several undercover assignments and helped make contact with rebels on other [[Planet/Legends|worlds]].\n\nAfter the founding of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Tharen was given command of [[Red Hand Squadron]]. She began planning a raid on Ylesia to end the slavery operation, recruiting a number of [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] pilots to act as guides, including Han Solo, with the promise of a share of the Ylesian spice. Tharen and Solo briefly resumed their relationship, but when the Rebels betrayed the smugglers at the [[Battle of Ylesia]], taking all of the spice, Tharen and Solo parted once more. Shortly after, Tharen led Red Hand Squadron on a [[Battle of Toprawa|mission]] to [[Toprawa/Legends|Toprawa]] to help retrieve the [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] for the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]]. Though they were successful in transmitting the plans to a Rebel [[Tantive IV/Legends|courier ship]], her unit was surrounded by Imperial forces, and Tharen committed [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] rather than face capture and interrogation.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|My mother always kept a tight rein and made me feel as though I could never do anything right. Studying hard and behaving myself weren't enough for her. My father encouraged me to have a career, but all Mother could think about was my making a 'brilliant match.'|Bria Tharen, on her childhood|The Paradise Snare}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]],<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> Bria Tharen was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] around [[28 BBY/Legends|28 BBY]]<ref name=\"birth\" /> to a wealthy [[Tharen family|family]] from the southern continent of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]].<ref name=\"TPS\">''[[The Paradise Snare]]''</ref> Her name was made up by her [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Renn Tharen]], from the first syllables of her grandmothers' names, [[Brusela]] and [[Iaphagena]].<ref name=\"RD\" /> She grew up on her family's estate, living with Renn, her mother [[Sera Tharen|Sera]], and her older brother [[Pavik Tharen|Pavik]]. As a young girl, Tharen enjoyed studying history, finding herself particularly fascinated by stories of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], the birth of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the recent [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. She wanted to be a [[Museum/Legends|museum]] curator and spent a couple of [[Summer/Legends|summers]] working on an [[Archaeology/Legends|archaeological]] dig, learning to preserve ancient treasures. When she finished her undergraduate [[school]]ing at the age of seventeen, Tharen was due to study archaeology with an emphasis on ancient art<ref name=\"TPS\" /> at the [[University of Coruscant/Legends|University of Coruscant]].<ref name=\"NEGTC\" />\n\nWhile Renn Tharen encouraged Bria's desire to have a career, Sera was more concerned in finding her a wealthy suitor and pushed her towards a relationship with [[Dael Levare]], a young man from one of the wealthiest families on Corellia who Bria had known since they were at school together. The two began dating and were close to becoming engaged when Tharen discovered that Levare had been unfaithful and broke off their relationship. Her mother was furious with Tharen for ruining her plans for the expected [[Marriage/Legends|wedding]] and instructed her daughter to apologize to Levare and take him back. Tharen refused and, upset and angry, attended a revival being held by a [[t'landa Til]] missionary from [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]]. The service ended with a few seconds of [[Exultation]], a process which produced a powerful feeling of rapture in Tharen and which she believed to be a religious experience. Feeling that there was little left for her on Corellia, Tharen sold all her jewelry to buy passage to Ylesia.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\n===Pilgrim 921===\n{{Quote|I want to serve the One, be part of the All, forever.|Bria Tharen talks about her religion|The Paradise Snare}}\n[[File:BriaTharen-TEC.jpg|thumb|left|Bria Tharen]]\nUnknown to Tharen, her newfound [[Cult of The One and The All|religion]] was an elaborate scam orchestrated by the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Besadii/Legends|Besadii]] [[Kajidic/Legends|clan]] to acquire workers to process [[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]], a [[Spice/Legends|spice]] which gave its users a temporary [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathic]] ability. Arriving on Ylesia as a [[Pilgrim/Legends|pilgrim]], Tharen was forced to give up all her possessions, including her name, and became known only as Pilgrim 921. She was assigned to a communal dormitory in [[Peace City|Colony One]], the first of three colonies inhabited by Ylesia's pilgrims.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nTharen spent almost a [[Standard year/Legends|year]] working in the processing plants, measuring and trimming the fibrous strands of raw glitterstim to ensure consistent doses of the spice for export. Glitterstim was highly reactive to light; as a result, Tharen had to perform her work in complete darkness, only able to see through [[Infrared goggles/Legends|infrared goggles]]. Every night, Tharen would attend devotions, during which t'landa Til [[Priest/Legends|priests]] performed the Exultation, to which Tharen developed an addiction. Over time, her poor diet caused her to become excessively thin and extended time working in darkness left her skin with a pale complexion. The dangerous work also left her with numerous scars on her fingers, wrists and forearms from the sharp threads of glitterstim, and she developed a [[Fungus/Legends|fungal]] infection due to the planet's warm, moist [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]].<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nIn [[10 BBY/Legends|10 BBY]],<ref name=\"TERC\" /> Tharen attracted the attention of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], a young [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] who had recently begun working for Besadii under the alias Vykk Draygo, [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] the processed glitterstim. While touring the processing plant, Solo noticed Tharen cut herself and asked if she needed medical attention. Unwilling to risk missing the evening's Exultation, Tharen refused and Solo was led away by his [[Togorian/Legends|Togorian]] [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]], [[Muuurgh]], so as not to further distract the workers. The following day, Solo sought Tharen out in the refectory and asked about her injury. Tharen informed him that it was healing, but was unwilling to talk further to a non-believer. Solo, however, was unwilling to give up and insisted on accompanying her to evening devotions and walking her back to her dormitory. On the way, the two Corellians discussed their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and Tharen's former aspirations to work in a museum.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nSolo's interest, and Tharen's own attraction toward him, left her feeling uneasy since relationships were forbidden to pilgrims. Despite this, she agreed to see him again and, on a subsequent meeting, revealed her birth name to him. Solo soon learned that pilgrims only remained on Ylesia for a year before they were shipped off-world to work as [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] in the glitterstim [[Mining/Legends|mines]] on [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]]. Knowing that Tharen's year was almost over, Solo resolved to find a way to keep her on Ylesia. When he heard that the t'landa Til [[High Priest/Legends|High Priest]] [[Teroenza]] was looking for somebody to maintain and catalog his extensive collection of artifacts, Solo suggested Tharen for the job. Tharen was interviewed by Teroenza and given the job soon after.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nTharen enjoyed being able to use her knowledge of antiques in her new work and considered it an honor to work for the High Priest. She turned down a room in the colony's administration center, insisting that she still live with the other pilgrims, but her new job gave her access to fresh air and [[Star/Legends|sunlight]], allowing her to shed her pale appearance. The prolonged darkness had left her so drained of energy that she initially continued to eat very little. After the colony's [[Medical droid/Legends|medical droids]] treated her for malnutrition, as well as her fungal infection, she regained her appetite and began to look less gaunt within a [[Standard month/Legends|month]]. Although Tharen was still wary of Solo, and continued to resist her growing feelings for him, over the next three months the two became friends and Tharen began joining Solo and Muuurgh for a [[stim tea]] before devotions.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nHoping to prove to Tharen that her religion was a hoax, Solo made a secret recording of High Priest Teroenza and [[Sacredot]] [[Veratil]] in which they admitted that the Exultation was merely a refinement of a biological ability used by t'landa Til males to attract a mate. When Solo presented the evidence to Tharen, she refused to believe it and accused him of faking the recording, so Solo gave her a vial of glitterstim so she could use its telepathic effects to read his mind and find out the truth. Instead, Tharen took the vial when she next attended devotions and used it to read Teroenza's mind, discovering his pride in manipulating the pilgrims and his singular desire to enrich himself at their expense. Sensing that his mind was being probed, Teroenza brought an abrupt end to the Exultation and began searching the crowd for the culprit. The confused pilgrims, however, began to return to their dormitories, allowing Tharen to get slip away among the crowd.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\n===Escape from Ylesia===\n{{Quote|We're gonna be together, sweetheart. We're gonna get off this hellish planet, and we're gonna be happy.''\"<br />\"''But they never let pilgrims go. I read that in Teroenza's mind.''\"<br />\"''We won't ask 'em, honey. We'll just up and go.|Solo and Tharen begin to plan their escape|The Paradise Snare}}\nThe revelation that everything she believed in was a lie, left Tharen feeling betrayed and angry. Later that night she talked to Solo who confided that he was already planning their escape from Ylesia. When she read Teroenza's mind, Tharen had already learned the security codes to the High Priest's private [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]], the [[Talisman (starship)|''Talisman'']], which Solo intended to use to escape. However, she was concerned that Muuurgh would try to stop them and did not want to see him hurt. The Togorian had originally come to Ylesia in search of his mate, [[Mrrov]]; when he was told that she was not there, he had been forced to take a job to fund his continuing search. Tharen recalled having seen another Togorian on Ylesia several months earlier and suggested that Mrrov may be in one of the other colonies. After confirming that the priests had lied to him and that Mrrov had been on Ylesia all along, Muuurgh agreed to help Solo and Tharen escape, if they took the two Togorians with them.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nTharen continued to work for Teroenza while the group made preparations for their escape. While she worked, she began to pick out the most valuable items in Teroenza's collection, which Solo intended to steal to fund his application to join the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]]. No longer believing in the Ylesian religion, Tharen intended to stop attending devotions where possible, but still found herself drawn the Altar of Promises and the feeling of rapture brought on by the Exultation. One night while Solo was off-world, Tharen was returning to her dormitory following the Exultation when she was stopped by Teroenza's [[Majordomo/Legends|majordomo]], [[Ganar Tos]]. The elderly [[Zisian]] had become attracted to Tharen and has asked Teroenza for permission to marry her, to which the High Priest had agreed. Tos led Tharen back to the Altar of Promises where Teroenza was waiting to conduct the ceremony but Tharen claimed that her customs required a day to purify herself first. Much to Tos's disappointment, Teroenza agreed to wait and announced that the pair would be married the following night in front of the full congregation.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nBy the time Solo returned later that night, Muuurgh had learned that Mrrov was due to be sent to Kessel the following day. With her own reasons to escape that night, Tharen was already waiting for him when Solo went to her dormitory to fetch her, and the two Corellians headed to Teroenza's collection room to meet Muuurgh. The group began to gather the items Tharen had selected and were almost finished when Solo inadvertently triggered an alarm. Before they could escape, they were confronted by Teroenza, his Hutt overlord, [[Zavval]] and several guards. In the ensuing firefight, Solo shot the Hutt's [[Hoversled/Legends|hoversled]], causing him to crash into the room's central support pillar and be crushed as the ceiling collapsed. Tharen, Solo and Muuurgh survived, as did Teroenza, who charged at the escapees, only to be shot and wounded by Solo. The group fled the collection room but were confronted by more guards outside. After Solo and Muuurgh dispatched the guards, Tharen saw Ganar Tos attempting to sneak up on Solo and [[Stun/Legends|stunned]] the Zisian with her [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] before the group headed to the ''Talisman''.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nFinally reaching Teroenza's yacht, the group took off and headed for [[Colony Two]], from where Mrrov would soon be departing for Kessel. They arrived shortly before dawn to find the pilgrims assembled and awaiting their transport. Solo hovered the yacht over the crowd while Tharen lowered Muuurgh down in a harness to fetch his mate. The arrival of Teroenza's ship had taken the guards by surprise, but they soon reacted and opened fire on the descending Togorian. Tharen and Muuurgh returned fire until Mrrov, recognizing her mate, made her way through the crowd to join him. When Mrrov reached the harness, Tharen brought both Togorians aboard and Solo took the ship out of the atmosphere and safely into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]].<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\n===Life with Han Solo===\n{{Quote|You've been free all your life, Han. And strong. I envy you for that. I'm going to be free someday, too. And strong.|Bria Tharen, in her farewell letter to Han Solo|The Paradise Snare}}\nAfter leaving Ylesia, the group traveled to [[Togoria/Legends|Togoria]] to take Muuurgh and Mrrov home. When they arrived the Togorians announced their intention to marry and invited the Corellians to stay for the wedding ceremony. During the next few days, Tharen and Solo spent much time together, taking several long walks and a [[mosgoth]] ride to the beach, where Tharen taught Solo how to swim. However, even as her relationship with Solo was growing, Tharen was struggling to cope with her new life. Her addiction to the Exultation caused her to experience intense withdrawal symptoms, including panic attacks and fits of crying, which Mrrov, who had overcome her own addiction while still on Ylesia, assured her would diminish with time. Tharen also felt that she had lost her sense of purpose and was angry toward those who had lied to her and who were still enslaving many other pilgrims.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\n[[File:Han-TPS.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Han Solo, during his time with Tharen]]\nAfter attending the wedding, Tharen and Solo left for Corellia to reunite Tharen with her parents. Arriving in the [[Corellian system]] three days later, Solo landed the ''Talisman'' at [[Truthful Toryl's Used Spaceship Lot]] on the planet [[Talus/Legends|Talus]] where he intended to sell the vessel. However, [[Toryl]], the lot's [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] proprietor recognized the ship and informed them that the Hutts were searching for it. As a result, he could only offer scrap value of 5,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Though the offer was far less than Solo and Tharen had been hoping for, they accepted.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nPosing as a married couple, the pair booked passage on a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] to Corellia's southern continent where Tharen had an emotional reunion with her family. Tharen's father gave Solo a warm welcome for rescuing his daughter, but her mother and brother were suspicious of the young pilot and disapproved of his relationship with Tharen. Their suspicions were confirmed the following day when Sera arranged for Dael Levare to visit the Tharen estate in the hopes of reigniting his relationship with her daughter. As a child, Solo had worked for the criminal [[Garris Shrike]] on a number of confidence tricks and Levare recognized him from one such scam. Although Renn Tharen forbade his wife and son from reporting Solo to the [[Corellian Security Force]], arguing that they owed him a second chance, Tharen did not trust them not to do it behind his back and decided that she and Solo should leave Corellia.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nBefore leaving, Solo sold the artifacts stolen from Teroenza's collection and arranged for the money to be paid into a [[Bank/Legends|bank]] account under the name of [[Jenos Idanian]], an alias which was not known to the Hutts. Tharen and Solo booked passage on a [[Passenger liner/Legends|passenger liner]] bound for [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], where Solo intended to withdraw the money and submit his application to the Imperial Academy. After arriving on Coruscant five days later, Tharen found herself overwhelmed by the [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]]. As she stared over a ledge at the [[Coruscant underworld|lower levels]] of the [[Galactic City|city]], her feelings of [[vertigo]] mixed with a desire to [[Suicide/Legends|jump]], knowing that her death would free her from the pain she still felt over the loss of the Exultation. Tharen resisted the urge and she and Solo made their way to a cheap [[Hotel/Legends|hostel]] where they spent the night.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nThe following morning, Solo headed for the bank to withdraw the money. When Solo failed to return on time, Tharen realized something had gone wrong and headed to their agreed meeting point, a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] called [[The Glow Spider]]. Solo eventually arrived and Tharen learned that Corellian Security had discovered the fake account and blocked it. On the run from the Imperial [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|security forces]], the pair found a room in a cheap but secure flophouse on one of the lower levels of the city.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nThe money from the sale of the ''Talisman'' was running low and Solo suggested that they abandon Coruscant and try to make a life together elsewhere. Tharen, however, did not want to see Solo sacrifice his dream of becoming an [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]] for her sake. Fearing that she was becoming too reliant on him to help her overcome her addiction, and that this would only hold them both back, she decided that they must go their separate ways. Slipping out while Solo slept, Tharen found a nearby cantina and used its [[Comm unit/Legends|comm unit]] to contact her father on Corellia and ask for his help. Renn Tharen warned her not to return home as Corellian Security were looking for her, but arranged for a business associate on Coruscant to meet with her and deliver some money. She returned once more to the room she shared with Solo, leaving him an emotional letter explaining why she had to leave and enough money for him to enter the Academy before leaving to confront the addiction alone.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\n===Joining the resistance===\n{{Quote|It cost me everything that was important to me, basically. Love, family &hellip; security. But it was worth it, to be myself. And it brought me a new purpose in life.|Bria Tharen tells Winter about overcoming her addiction and joining the Resistance|Rebel Dawn}}\n[[File:Garm_Bel_Iblis_TFUCG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tharen was an early member of Garm Bel Iblis's Corellian resistance movement.]]\nTharen spent almost three years trying to overcome her addiction to the Exultation, wandering from world to world, trying everything from meditation to drugs. Twice she bought tickets to return to Ylesia, though she could never go through with it. Eventually, she returned to Corellia where she found a group that helped her to overcome her addiction. Finding a new purpose in life,<ref name=\"RD\" /> Tharen joined [[Garm Bel Iblis]]'s [[Corellian Resistance/Legends|Corellian resistance movement]]<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> and resolved to devote herself to fighting against slavery and the Empire that condoned it. In order to protect her family from Imperial retribution, she cut off all contact with them, though she found ways to let her father know she was alright a couple of times a year through roundabout channels.<ref name=\"RD\" /> Over the next few years the resistance movement grew from a small group of dissidents gathering for clandestine meetings to having several thousand operatives and cells in most major Corellian cities. Tharen, like most of those involved with the resistance, was unaware of its full size and structure, ensuring that she could not compromise the organization if caught.<ref name=\"THG\">''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''</ref>\n\nTharen's work with the resistance involved making contact with resistance groups on other worlds, but they also supported her in fighting back against Besadii and their slave operation on Ylesia.<ref name=\"THG\" /> In [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]],<ref name=\"TERC\" /> the resistance dispatched Tharen and [[Lanah Malo]] to [[Devaron/Legends|Devaron]] to make contact with the local resistance. Learning that Sacredot Veratil was on the planet to recruit pilgrims for Ylesia, the pair planned to assassinate the priest while he conducted a revival in the town square. As she and Malo moved through the large crowd, Tharen was spotted by Han Solo, who had come to Devaron after being discharged from the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] for disobeying orders. Solo's attempts to reach her brought him to Veratil's attention and the t'landa Til alerted his guards. The sight of Solo stirred up old feelings in Tharen, but she couldn't let him see her for fear of compromising her mission. Tharen and Malo were forced to abandon their assassination attempt and flee back to the cheap room they had rented for their stay. Despite their failure to kill Veratil, the pair did make contact with the Devaronian resistance before returning to Corellia.<ref name=\"THG\" />\n\nSeveral months later, Tharen led a [[Raid on Colony Three|dawn raid]] on Ylesia's [[Colony Three]]. The raid resulted in the deaths of a dozen guard, damage to several buildings and the liberation of ninety-seven slaves. It also earned Tharen the wrath of the Besadii clan, leading [[Aruk Besadii Aora|Aruk]] the Hutt to put a 50,000 credit [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on her head. However, the rebels initially had difficulty persuading the freed slaves of the truth about Ylesia. Only two out of the two hundred slaves had been prepared to leave with them and Tharen had been forced to order her troops to stun the others. The pull of the Exultation proved too strong for many and, within a month, fifty-three had run away to return to Ylesia. This, combined with the turbulent atmosphere on Ylesia, which had destroyed one of the rebel ships, discouraged further attacks on Ylesia itself for the time being, but Tharen was involved in several raids on ships carrying slaves from Ylesia to Kessel.<ref name=\"THG\" />\n\n===Undercover agent===\n{{Dialogue|Sarn Shild|Master Jobekk Jonn of Nal Hutta, my &hellip; niece &hellip; Bria.|Bria Tharen|It's a pleasure to meet you, Master Jonn.|Han Solo|The pleasure is all mine.

One mission saw her working on the civilian staff at the largest Imperial military base on Corellia, charged with learning as much as she could about Imperial operations and reporting her findings to [[Rion (individual)|her contact]] within the resistance. Her position only gave her access to bureaucratic lists, such as supply orders, but soon learned that the Imperials were building up their strength in the Corellian [[Star system/Legends|system]]. Hoping to learn more, Tharen used her looks to manipulate [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Trefaren]] into inviting her to a reception being held by the Corellian government for senior Imperial officers, including several [[Moff/Legends|Moffs]].<ref name=\"THG\" />\n\nLater that year, Tharen went undercover posing as the mistress of [[Sarn Shild]], the Imperial Moff whose territory included [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]]. In truth Shild's sexual preferences weren't for Human women and he kept her around as a show object. Tharen was responsible for overseeing his household staff and office and became the Moff's confidant. Although she hated the assignment, Tharen was able to funnel a large amount of information back to Corellia.<ref name=\"THG\" />\n\nShild had always allowed the Hutts to operate with near impunity in exchange for certain \"political contributions.\" However, while Tharen was assigned to Shild, the Emperor demanded that Shild clamp down on the Hutts and put an end to the trafficking of illegal weapons from Hutt Space. In response, the [[Desilijic/Legends|Desilijic]] clan sent Han Solo&mdash;who was now working as a smuggler for Desilijic&mdash;to Coruscant to negotiate with Shild while he attended a conference there on law and order. Tharen accompanied Shild on his trip and stayed in his luxury penthouse, where she briefly encountered Solo after Shild rejected his attempts to negotiate. Tharen was unable to tell Solo the truth and he left thinking that her relationship with Shild was genuine.<ref name=\"THG\" />\n\nAfter leaving Coruscant, Tharen accompanied Shild to the [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] planetoid [[Velga Prime]] and later joined him on a [[Space station/Legends|space station]] orbiting his headquarters on the planet [[Teth/Legends|Teth]] to watch Shild's [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]], under the command of Admiral [[Winstel Greelanx]], depart for the Hutt [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. She was shocked to hear Shild announce his intention to follow his offensive against the Hutts by declaring independence for his [[Sector/Legends|sector]] and launching a campaign against Emperor Palpatine. Shild's fleet was subsequently defeated by a smuggler coalition at the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]] and Tharen withdrew from her assignment shortly before Shild took his own life.<ref name=\"THG\" /> The resistance later learned that Greelanx had been under Imperial orders to make the attack fail and Tharen came to suspect that Palpatine, seeing Shild as a threat, had manipulated him into his own downfall.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\n===Birth of the Alliance===\n{{Quote|I know what a daunting and dangerous proposal this is, believe me.

Both Tharen and the leaders of her movement felt that the scattered groups needed to unite if they were to overthrow Emperor Palpatine. One assignment saw Tharen travel to the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] homeworld [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] where she helped advise Wookiee resistance members on organization, codes and tactics.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nLater, when Tharen learned of a major [[Cloud City Sabacc Tournament|sabacc tournament]] being held on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] on the planet [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]], she realized that the large number of visitors during the tournament would make it an ideal place to hold a meeting with several rebel groups. Traveling to Bespin with her aide, [[Jace Paol]], Tharen met with representatives from three other resistance groups; [[Jenssar SoBilles]] from [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], [[Sian Tevv/Legends|Sian Tevv]] from [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]] and [[Hric Dalhney]], [[Winter Celchu|Winter]] and [[Ylenic It'kla]] from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. Although all groups were fighting for the same cause, Tharen struggled to gain any commitment from them to work with the Corellian resistance. However, she did succeed in convincing Winter, who promised to help convince [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]] of Alderaan upon her return. While in Cloud City, Tharen once again caught sight of Han Solo, and watched him win the Cloud City [[Sabacc/Legends|Sabacc]] Tournament, though she again made sure that he was not aware of her presence.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nTharen continued to work towards uniting the rebel groups, meeting with Commander [[Winfrid Dagore]] and [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Palob Godalhi/Legends|Palob Godalhi]] of the Tethan resistance in their enclave beneath the planet's [[Spaceport/Legends|port city]]. The Tethans were initially skeptical, but Tharen convinced them to increase their raids on Imperial supply vessels and munitions dumps in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] and to supply the stolen weapons to other rebel groups. Around the same time, [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] of [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] entered into negotiations with Tharen's superiors and Bail Organa of Alderaan, which led to the signing of the [[Corellian Treaty]] and the formal creation of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Forced to flee the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]] on charges of [[Treason/Legends|treason]], Mon Mothma began meeting with resistance groups on worlds throughout the Empire and the Alliance soon began to grow.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\n===Red Hand Squadron===\n{{Quote|You're wasting my time, vermin. Kill me or let me go&mdash;but you'll get nothing from me.|Bria Tharen, when confronted by a slaver|Rebel Dawn}}\nThe signing of the Corellian Treaty allowed Tharen to leave her liaison work and become more involved in combat. She was given command of the [[Marauder-class corvette|''Marauder''-class corvette]] [[Retribution (Marauder-class)|''Retribution'']] and the [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-wing starfighters]] of [[Crimson Fury]] and assembled a team of Rebels to serve under her, many of whom were former slaves. Tharen's crew held her in great esteem and, like Tharen herself, were willing to give their lives to free others from slavery. They quickly acquired a reputation for giving no quarter to slavers, who consequently named them \"[[Red Hand Squadron]]\". Tharen happily adopted the name and had the symbol of a [[Blood/Legends|blood]]-dripping [[Limb/Legends|hand]] painted on the bow of her [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]].<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\n[[File:BriaTharenRebel.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Bria Tharen, during her time in the Rebel Alliance]]\nTharen's fifth mission as commander of the ''Retribution'' was the [[Capture of the Helot's Shackle|capture]] of the [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] [[Emancipator (CR90 corvette)|''Helot's Shackle'']], which was carrying nearly two hundred slaves from Ylesia to Kessel. The ''Retribution''{{'s}} medical officer, [[Daino Hyx]], had developed new techniques for curing Exultation addiction which Tharen planned to test on the slaves held aboard the ''Helot's Shackle''. Twenty-six of the slaves Tharen had rescued during the previous two years had gone on to serve as active members in the resistance and Tharen hoped that Hyx's methods would help them gain more new recruits.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nThe ''Retribution'' and Crimson Fury's Y-wings waited outside the [[Cha Raaba system|Ylesia system]] until a Rebel operative on the space station orbiting Ylesia signaled that the ''Helot's Shackle'' had departed, at which point they jumped into the system to catch the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] before it could jump to hyperspace. Upon arriving, the Y-wings commenced strafing runs to bring down the ''Helot's Shackle''{{'s}} [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shields]] and disable the vessel. Tharen remained aboard the ''Retribution'' to coordinate the attack while the first wave of shuttles boarded the slaver corvette and neutralized the majority of the slaver resistance, but personally joined the second wave to help finish the last pockets of resistance.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nAs her squad made their way to the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] they encountered a group of slavers. Tharen's forces fought their way past, killing three of the slavers and leaving six wounded. Tharen ordered that the survivors be executed before proceeding to the captain's quarters, located beneath the bridge. Blowing a hole through the ceiling, she led her squad into the bridge and killed the remaining slavers, bringing the ship under Rebel control. With the ship captured, Tharen made her way to meet Hyx at the slave hold. However, she was surprised by an armed slaver who had evaded the Rebels and who demanded a shuttle and her share of the slaves. When the slaver's aim wavered momentarily, Tharen pulled her own blaster and shot the slaver in the chest. Leaving the slaver to die, Tharen released the slaves and left them to Hyx's care.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nWhen the ''Helot's Shackle''{{'s}} systems were brought back online, Tharen took both the captured vessel and the ''Retribution'' to rendezvous with the Rebel ship [[Deliverance (Rebel Alliance)|''Deliverance'']] to transfer the pilgrims. The rescued pilgrims were taken to [[Grenna Base]] where Hyx had great success in treating them, with over a ninety percent success rate, and many of the cured pilgrims volunteered to join the Alliance. The ''Helot's Shackle'' itself was refitted to serve as a Rebel combat ship and Tharen christened the ship ''Emancipator''. As a result of the raid, [[Durga Besadii Tai]], the new leader of Besadii, increased the bounty on Tharen to 100,000 credits.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nOne month after the capture of the ''Helot's Shackle'', Tharen was recalled to Corellia. On the way, the ''Retribution'' picked up a call from the Rebel ship ''[[Pride of the Rim]]'' requesting help against some Imperial picket ships. The ''Retribution'' responded, but took some damage to its [[sublight drive]], delaying Tharen for a day while repairs were conducted.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nWhen she finally arrived at Corellia, Tharen met with her commanding officer, [[Pianat Torbul]], who informed her that Red Hand Squadron was to be assigned to assist Rebel forces in the Outer Rim. During the meeting Tharen suggested that, with their success in curing Exultation addiction, the time had come for a major attack on Ylesia. With over eight thousand pilgrims on Ylesia, they presented a major source of potential recruits and, in addition, they would be able to steal tons of valuable spice to help finance the war on the Empire. Although Torbul agreed to consider Tharen's plan, funding such a large invasion would be difficult and safely negotiating Ylesia's atmosphere was a major concern. Tharen resolved to find a solution to both problems.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\n===Journey to Nar Shaddaa===\n{{Quote|Helot's Shackle was a slave ship. I had to stop them. I have no regrets.''\"<br />\"''Good. That should make our short association as pleasant as possible.|Bria Tharen and Boba Fett|Rebel Dawn}}\nTharen's solution to funding was to enlist the help of the Desilijic Hutts and she arranged to meet with Desilijic's leader, [[Jiliac Desilijic Tiron]], on the Hutt homeworld [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. Although Hutts had no particular interest in the Rebellion, Desilijic's business was being hurt by the Besadii clan's operations on Ylesia and Tharen hoped that they might be willing to fund the attack on their rivals. Tharen arranged passage to Hutt Space aboard the [[Haj Shipping Lines]] [[Luxury liner/Legends|luxury liner]] ''[[Queen of Empire]]'', traveling under the guise of Bria Lavval, a cabaret singer who was due to perform at the [[Chance Castle]] [[Casino/Legends|casino]] on Nar Shaddaa, and sharing a stateroom with three members of Red Hand Squadron posing as her agent, business manager and bodyguard.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nOn the fourth night of the voyage, Tharen visited the [[Star Winds Lounge]] nightclub to witness a performance by the [[Rughja]] orchestra-band [[Umjing Baab and His Swinging Trio]]. At one point, [[Umjing Baab]] invited Tharen to join them on stage to perform the hit song \"[[Smoky Dreams]].\" Tharen's performance was well received by the males in the audience, among them the gambler [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]]. As Tharen returned to her seat, Calrissian asked her to dance; staying in character, she accepted. While they danced, Calrissian mentioned that his friend owned a [[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub]] [[Starmite|''Starmite''-class freighter]] called ''[[Bria]]''. Realizing that he knew Solo, Tharen invited Calrissian to her quarters later that evening, hoping to learn more about what her former lover had been doing since she last saw him.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nHowever, when Tharen arrived at her quarters, she was attacked by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. Fett had been hunting Tharen intermittently for over a year but the bounty specified that she should be captured alive and her frequent deep-cover assignments, together with the high security at Rebel installations made her very difficult to get close to. Having tracked her to the ''Queen of Empire'', Fett waited for her to be alone and shot her with a [[tranquilizer dart]] as she entered her quarters. Tharen awoke to find herself bound and her companions dead. Knowing that escape was unlikely, Tharen asked Fett if he would let her father know that she was dead so he wouldn't have to find out when her next message failed to arrive. To her surprise, Fett agreed to the request.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nBefore Fett could take his prize back to his ship, Calrissian arrived. Tharen was unable to warn the gambler and Fett captured him too. Fett intended to leave Calrissian alive, provided that Tharen not cause him any trouble. However, when the ''Queen of Empire'' was pulled out of hyperspace by a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] raid led by Calrissian's ex-girlfriend, [[Drea Renthal]], Fett led both his prisoners towards the [[Hangar/Legends|shuttle bay]]. On the way they were cornered by Renthal and a large group of pirates. Renthal agreed to let Fett leave without trouble, provided that he release Calrissian first. The bounty hunter accepted the offer but Calrissian refused to leave Tharen to Fett and pointed out that Renthal owed Solo a favor. Renthal offered to pay Fett the 100,000 credit bounty to let Tharen go. Outnumbered by the pirates, Fett reluctantly agreed.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nAfter the pirates concluded their raid, they took Tharen and Calrissian to Nar Shaddaa aboard Renthal's flagship, the [[Carrack-class light cruiser/Legends|''Carrack''-class light cruiser]] ''[[Renthal's Vigilance]]''. From there, Tharen took a shuttle to Nal Hutta where she met with Jiliac. Her proposal was simple, Desilijic would finance the Rebel raid on Ylesia, and would arrange for the elimination of the t'landa Til priests beforehand. In exchange the Rebels would ensure that Besadii's operations on Ylesia were shut down for good by destroying the spice factories. Jiliac's nephew, [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], was impressed and argued that they should consider the offer, but Jiliac refused to get involved with the Rebels and turned Tharen down. Before leaving, however, Tharen gave Jabba a [[Datacard/Legends|datacard]] with her contact details in case Jiliac ever reconsidered.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nAfter Tharen returned to Nar Shaddaa, she went for a meal with Calrissian, who was happy to regale her with the story of the Battle of Nar Shaddaa, in which he had participated. Tharen was impressed with the way the smugglers had managed to defeat the Empire in battle. Rebel pilots were eager but lacked the proper training required to negotiate Ylesia's turbulent atmosphere. Tharen realized that, for any attack to succeed, the Rebels would need excellent pilots to act as guides, and that the smugglers' experience made them ideal for the job, if they would be willing to hire themselves out.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\n===Return to Ylesia===\n{{Quote|Bria &hellip; I loved you.''\"<br />\"''Han, I love you! I do! But I can't let how I feel about you jeopardize the Rebel Alliance!|Han Solo and Bria Tharen, during the raid on Ylesia|Rebel Dawn}}\n[[File:Bria_Tharen.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Tharen takes part in a mission for the Alliance.]]\nTharen returned to the ''Retribution'', but a month after her meeting with Jiliac, she was contacted by Jabba the Hutt, who had become the leader of Desilijic after Jiliac's death at the hands of Durga the Hutt. Jabba informed Tharen that he had decided to accept her offer and was already placing operatives on Ylesia to assassinate the priests. Tharen returned to Nar Shaddaa to meet with Jabba and plan the operation. While on the Smuggler's Moon, Tharen tracked down Solo, finding him and his Wookiee co-pilot [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] in the [[Blue Light]] tavern. After an emotional reunion, Tharen asked Solo to help her pitch her idea to his smuggler contacts. In exchange for their assistance, the smugglers would be given a share of Ylesia's spice and Tharen promised to give Solo a share of Teroenza's collection.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nSolo, who was still angry with Tharen for leaving him ten years earlier, initially refused to help. However, Solo's business sense eventually overcame his personal feelings and later that night, the smuggler visited Tharen's room at [[The Smuggler's Rest]] and agreed to convince his friends, in exchange for fifty percent of Teroenza's treasure. Over the following days, Tharen and Solo recruited many smugglers and [[Privateer/Legends|privateers]] for the mission. By the time the pair traveled to the Alliance's deep [[Realspace/Legends|space]] rendezvous point aboard Solo's [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]] [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], the Rebels had assembled most of their attack force, including personnel and ships from Corellia, [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]], Sullust, Alderaan and Chandrila, for what would be the Alliance's largest operation to date.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nTharen and Solo attended several planning sessions over the next two days, before Tharen was instructed to meet with some potential allies on [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]]. Accepting Solo's offer of a ride, Tharen traveled to the [[Mid Rim]] world and convinced Rebel leaders there to commit three ships and a hundred [[Trooper/Legends|troops]] to the Ylesia raid. As they were preparing to return to the rendezvous point, Tharen received orders to pick up a group of Togorians who had volunteered for the mission on the way back. Upon arriving at Togoria, Tharen and Solo learned that their old friends, Muuurgh and Mrrov, were among the volunteers. The Togorians were still waiting for one member of their group to arrive so arranged accommodation for their visitors for the night. Being back on Togoria stirred up old feelings and Tharen and Solo resumed their relationship.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nAfter returning to the fleet, Tharen began final preparations for the imminent assault. There would be nine Rebel attack groups&mdash;one for each colony on Ylesia&mdash;with each accompanied by at least three smuggler guides. Tharen chose to lead Red Hand Squadron against Colony One and assigned Solo as one of the guides for her group. The night before the mission, Tharen received a message from Pianat Torbul. Intelligence reports indicated that the Empire was planning a major assault and the Alliance would need all the resources they could get if they were going to survive. Torbul ordered Tharen to take all of the weapons and spice she could capture.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nThe [[Battle of Ylesia]] saw the Rebels encounter heavier resistance than expected. As they entered the planet's atmosphere, the Rebel ships came under [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolaser]] fire and Tharen was forced to divert her group to their alternate landing site on a beach over two [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]] from the center of Colony One. Accompanied by Solo and Chewbacca, Tharen's team started up the beach but soon encountered resistance from a group of [[Nova Force]] [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]]. Splitting her group into two, Tharen caught the mercenaries in a crossfire, clearing the way into the colony.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nTharen dispatched the Togorians to secure the administration building and sent Jace Paol and a squad of troops to eliminate the turbolaser to allow reinforcements to land safely, while she led the rest of her troops into the colony to secure the factories, welcome center and dormitories. Despite heavy mercenary resistance, Tharen's forces captured the colony and secured the turbolaser defenses. Tharen made her way to the pilgrims' dormitory and addressed them as they were herded outside. Despite her attempts to calm them, however, the Exultation-deprived pilgrims charged their rescuers and Tharen was forced to have her troops fire stun beams into the crowd.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nFollowing her orders from the previous night, Tharen had the smugglers placed under guard, except for Solo and Chewbacca who she led to Teroenza's treasure room. When they entered, they were confronted by an armed Teroenza. Before Teroenza could fire, however, Boba Fett emerged from the shadows and shot him dead in order to claim a bounty on the t'landa Til. Soon after the bounty hunter left with his prize, a Rebel shuttle arrived to pick up Teroenza's treasure. Pulling her blaster on Solo and Chewbacca, Tharen explained that the Rebels needed every last credit and could not afford to share any of it. Tharen tried to persuade Solo to go with her and to fight the Empire at her side, but Solo was devastated by her betrayal and made it clear he did not want anything more to do with her. She and Solo parted on the worst of terms.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\n===The Yavin Vassilika===\n{{Quote|So are we even now?''\"<br />\"''Not even close, sister&hellip;|Bria Tharen and Han Solo|Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 5}}\n[[File:BriaTharen-YV5.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bria Tharen holding a fake Yavin Vassilika]]\nThe former lovers were, however, destined for one more reunion.

Each Hutt put together a team to search for the artifact and Solo was drawn into the hunt as part of Jabba's team, which also comprised Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian.<ref name=\"TYV1\">[[Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 1|''Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika'' 1]]</ref> Solo helped Moffet locate the artifact on an [[uncharted planet]] in [[Wild Space/Legends|Wild Space]],<ref name=\"TYV4\">[[Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 4|''Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika'' 4]]</ref> only for her to betray him and deliver it the rendezvous point on Yavin 4. Tharen accompanied Dodonna to the exchange and used her knowledge of antiquities to confirm that the artifact was genuine. However, the exchange was broken up by Solo and the other treasure hunters hired to find the Vassilika.<ref name=\"TYV5\" />\n\nAs the treasure hunters turned on each other, the Rebels fled into the Yavin 4 jungle with the Vassilika. Solo's team pursued and demanded their share of the Ylesia spoils. Dodonna informed them that it had already been spent on the war effort but agreed to help compensate them for their efforts. Taking cover in the jungle, Tharen and her team waited for the bounty hunters [[Dengar/Legends|Dengar]] and [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]], who were on Yavin 4<ref name=\"TYV5\" /> as part of Malta's team,<ref name=\"TYV1\" /> to approach. Capturing the bounty hunters, the Rebels turned them over to Solo and Calrissian so that they could claim the 200,000 credit bounty on the pair which had been posted by the rival bounty hunter [[Zuckuss/Legends|Zuckuss]]. Despite Tharen's help, Solo was still visibly furious; once again he had helped her get something for the Rebellion and was left with nothing.<ref name=\"TYV5\" />\n\n===Final mission===\n{{Quote|I don't want to die either, Sk'kot.

Red Hand Squadron fought to hold off the Imperial forces while comm techs transmitted the plans to the Rebel courier ship [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] as it passed through the [[Toprawa system|system]]. By the time the ''Tantive IV'' left the system, Red Hand Squadron had taken heavy losses and Tharen, herself injured, had lost contact with the ''Retribution'' and their only chance of escape. Shortly after, Red Hand Squadron was finally overwhelmed by Imperial forces<ref name=\"RD\" /> and Tharen swallowed a [[Suicide pill/Legends|poison pill]] to avoid capture and interrogation.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> She died never knowing the importance of the plans she'd helped to recover.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nTharen's body was found and identified in the aftermath of the battle. When news of her death reached Boba Fett, the bounty hunter resolved to keep his promise to let her father know when she died.

A tall woman with [[Color/Legends|blue-green]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], long, dark eyelashes, poreless white skin and reddish-gold, curly [[Hair/Legends|hair]], she was not classically beautiful, but was considered attractive. She was particularly keen on history during her time at school, and was looking forward to continuing her studies at university in the hopes of pursuing a career as a museum curator. Although Tharen studied hard, she also made time to enjoy herself, attending numerous parties during her youth. However, she grew frustrated that working hard and behaving herself was seemingly not enough to please her mother. Sera Tharen kept a tight rein over her daughter and the young Bria grew up feeling that she could do nothing right by her. While her father supported Tharen in her desire to have a career, her mother wished only for her to marry into a family of good breeding. The falling out between the two after Tharen split from Dael Levare was the culmination of years of tension.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nFeeling that her life on Corellia was empty and meaningless, Tharen felt a new sense of purpose upon first experiencing the Exultation. Believing it to be a deeply spiritual experience, she gave up her old life to join the pilgrims on Ylesia, believing that her newfound faith would help her to make [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] a better place. For almost a year on Ylesia, Tharen was devoted to her religion. She held the t'landa Til priests in high regard and hoped to one day reach their level of spirituality. Despite her piety, Tharen sometimes thought of her old life and lamented the fact that both her memory and intelligence seemed to be fading over time.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nUpon meeting Han Solo, Tharen found herself attracted to his charm and energy. Despite Solo's own attraction to her, Tharen resisted her feelings, not wanting anything to distract her from her work and her prayers and she found herself falling in love with him. When she learned that her religion was a fraud Tharen felt betrayed and that her purpose in life had been taken away. After leaving Ylesia, Tharen entered into a relationship with Solo but found that she still had doubts. Solo was content to live a simple life but Tharen still hoped to find some purpose in life. In addition, she was suffering the effects of Exultation withdrawal and did not feel she could fully commit to Solo while she felt that a part of her was missing. The withdrawal cravings came in intense waves and Tharen could barely go an hour without missing it. She was afraid that she would not be strong enough to resist the temptation to return to Ylesia and even contemplated suicide as a way to end her suffering. Solo's support was instrumental in her fight to control her addiction, but Tharen came to feel that she was relying on him too heavily. Ultimately, she decided that she needed to overcome her addiction alone rather than risk holding Solo back from his own goals. However, she never stopped caring for Solo.<ref name=\"TPS\" />\n\nTharen eventually overcame both the mental and physical effects of her experience at Ylesia and came to realize that she did not have to punish herself for failing to live up to her mother's expectations. She found a new purpose in life working with the Corellian resistance movement and later the Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire. Ending slavery and helping others who were suffering as she once had was a major motivation for Tharen. As leader of Red Hand Squadron she inspired loyalty from those who served with her. However, she was also ruthless and unforgiving in battle, particularly with slavers, leading to Red Hand Squadron's reputation for taking no prisoners. Tharen was willing to sacrifice everything for the Rebellion. She put the Alliance ahead of her feelings for Solo, betraying him on both Ylesia<ref name=\"RD\" /> and Yavin 4.<ref name=\"TYV5\" /> Despite knowing that it would likely lead to her death, she did not hesitate to volunteer for Red Hand Squadron's final mission to Toprawa.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|You've changed.

Crispin]] to serve as Han Solo's romantic interest in the [[The Han Solo Trilogy|''Han Solo Trilogy'']] and first appeared in ''[[The Paradise Snare]]'', the first book in the trilogy, released in [[1997]].<ref name=\"TPS\" /> Her only other appearance to date was in [[Mike Kennedy]]'s [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] ''[[Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika]]'',<ref name=\"TYV5\" /> set during the events of ''[[Rebel Dawn]]'',<ref name=\"RD\" /><ref name=\"TYV5\" /> the novel in which the character is killed.<ref name=\"RD\" /> In the article ''[[Boba Fett: A Bounty Hunter's Journey]]'' in [[Star Wars Insider 117|''Star Wars Insider'' 117]], [[Leland Chee]] mistakenly refers to Bria Tharen as \"[[Lumiya|Shira Brie]].\"<ref name=\"Insider117\">{{InsiderCite|117|Boba Fett: A Bounty Hunter's Journey}}</ref>\n\nWhile developing the Han Solo Trilogy, Crispin worked backwards to try and provide an explanation for how Han Solo became the character that first appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. Solo appeared to her to be suspicious of women, especially those involved with the Rebellion. He also refused to help the Rebels unless he was paid and did not pursue a relationship with [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] until [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], set three years after their first meeting. Crispin concluded that Solo had been involved in a previous relationship with a Rebel woman which had ended with her betraying him. [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] agreed to the idea and Crispin developed the Bria Tharen character.<ref name=\"JCF\">{{JCFcite|postnum=30011806|board=Literature|thread=The JC Lit Forum Reviews RETROSPECTIVE Special: Han Solo Trilogy III: Rebel Dawn|user=[[A.

Given Solo's later relationship with Organa, Crispin chose to kill off the Tharen character before Solo met Organa, and saw the Battle of Toprawa&mdash;an event first described in the [[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]]&mdash;as a way to tie her death into the events of ''A New Hope''.<ref name=\"JCF\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Bria Tharen}}\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The Paradise Snare (audiobook)|''The Paradise Snare'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*[[The Hutt Gambit (audiobook)|''The Hutt Gambit'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*[[Rebel Dawn (audiobook)|''Rebel Dawn'' audiobook]]\n*[[Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 3|''Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika'' 3]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 4|''Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika'' 4]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 5|''Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika'' 5]]\n*''[[Star Wars Journal: Hero for Hire]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Tatooine Ghost]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|17|SOL1-2, ''Han Solo''}}\n*{{FFCite|35|FET17-18, ''Boba Fett''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|63|Gamescape}} <!-- 2002-10-18 -->\n*{{FFCite|125|THA1-2, ''Bria Tharen''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Annual 2009]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|106|Han Solo: The Early Years}}\n*{{InsiderCite|108|Ask Lobot}}\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|117|Boba Fett: A Bounty Hunter's Journey}}\n*{{DB|character|landocalrissian|Calrissian, Lando|archivedate=20110905182136}}\n*{{DB|character|jenny|Jenny|archivedate=20100116062043}}\n*{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Han|archivedate=20110903234809}}\n*{{DB|character|briatharen|Tharen, Bria|archivedate=20101017044322}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{FFCite|y=2014|20|1 BBY 11-14, ''Hunting the Yavin Vassilika''}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Bria Tharen\n|de=Bria Tharen\n|es=Bria Tharen\n|ja=\u30d6\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30b5\u30ec\u30f3\n|ru=\u0411\u0440\u0438\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tharen, Bria}}\n[[Category:Alliance Army officers]]\n[[Category:Archaeologists]]\n[[Category:Corellian Resistance members]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Diplomats]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Red Hand Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
