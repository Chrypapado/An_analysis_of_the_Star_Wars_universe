He ended up becoming a top contender in the gladiatorial [[Dool Arena]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Norrin had a natural ability to command [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] but his overall power was meager at best. Unable to rely upon his [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] he turned to other avenues to get by, namely gambling and fighting. Over the years he had been slowly consumed by the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. Although he was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], his powers were so weak that the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] did not bother to send anyone to hunt him down.\n\nHe eventually became a top contender in the [[Dool Arena]] on [[Reuss VIII]]. It was at the arena when [[Greel]], one of the arena's owners, matched Norrin up against a new challenger [[Lusubrin T'shkali]]. Norrin was disappointed with the match up as the [[Nagai]] challenger was still a new-comer to the arena.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNorrin's fighting style was similar to his gambling philosophy in that he would take risks if he thought the rewards outweighed the danger.\n\nHe was average-looking with green eyes and silvery hair. He was also one of the oldest contenders in the Drool Arena.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAlthough he had learned quite a few different ways to control the Force, his powers were always very weak and had very little impact.\n\nHe did train with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and was skilled enough in combat that he was able to become a top contender in the Dool Arena.\n\n==Equipment==\nIn addition to his [[Color/Legends|yellow]]-bladed lightsaber he carried a [[BlasTech Industries/Legends|BlasTech]] [[DL-18 Blaster Pistol|DL-18 blaster pistol]], although he was not allowed to use the blaster in the arena.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNorrin Vaxx was designed by [[Paul Danner]] and [[Bill Smith]] for ''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'', a supplement for the ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' that was published by [[West End Games]] in [[1997]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vaxx, Norrin}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Gladiators]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
