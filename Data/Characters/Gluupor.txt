But then again, Gluupor not very bright.|Gluupor|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\n'''Gluupor''' was a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] living in [[Ahto City]] in [[3956 BBY]]. Being poor and wanting to live richly for a short time, Gluupor saved up enough money to stay in the Ahto City visitor's hotel. Having been in the room next to [[Elassa Huros]]' at the time of her murder, Gluupor saw [[Sunry]] fleeing the scene of the crime. To pin the blame even further on Sunry, the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] paid him to plant Sunry's [[Hero's Cross]] in Elassa's room. He was later called as a key witness in Sunry's trial. Gluupor was unwilling to reveal his role in planting the false evidence, but under pressure admitted it to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who was serving as Sunry's [[Arbiter/Legends|Arbiter]].\n\nGluupor had a habit of referring to himself in the third person. In addition, he did not possess advanced proficiency in [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]] grammar and had a tendency to omit auxiliary and copula verbs, which were difficult for non-native speakers to interpret. According to himself, he was not very intelligent, but that did not necessarily have anything to do with his lack of Huttese proficiency.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nUnlike most non-[[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] speakers in ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'', Gluupor's language is more than just the usual set of Huttese phrases. One can hear him say specific words like \"Gluupor\" or \"[[Selkath/Legends|Selkath]]\" whenever the subtitles say he does.\n\nIn the Xbox version Gluupor is seen wearing a yellow suit, but during the trial his uniform is green.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gluupor\n|fi=Gluupor\n|ru=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
