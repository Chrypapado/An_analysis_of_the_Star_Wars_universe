The character was first named in \"[[Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night]]\", an article written by [[Daniel Wallace]] and published in [[Star Wars Insider]] [[Star Wars Insider 75|75]]. The article suggests that Vess might only wear the tattoo because Agira does and so not actually be a Zealot herself.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night}}\n*{{SWArchive|url=episode-ii/explore/attack/2002/10/imageattack20021025.html|text=Coruscant Glam|archivedate=20050227190837}}\n*{{DB|character|immidanoo|Danoo, Immi|archivedate=20100209200026}}\n*{{DB|character|roshavess|Vess, Rosha|archivedate=20110913120401}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rosha Vess\n|nl=Rosha Vess\n|pl=Rosha Vess\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vess, Rosha}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
