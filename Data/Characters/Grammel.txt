I am in charge of the secret mining colony on Cicarpous V.|Grammel, to Governor Essada|Splinter of the Mind's Eye}}\n[[File:Grammel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain-Supervisor Grammel]]\nGrammel earned a reputation as a ruthless, sadistic officer, routinely [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] prisoners, whether he needed to or not.\n\nWhen he learned of the existence of the [[Kaiburr crystal]] and the presence of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], he informed [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Bin Essada/Legends|Bin Essada]], who in turn informed [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].\n\nHowever, the two prisoners managed to escape from custody with the help of two [[Yuzzem]], [[Hin]] and [[Kee (Yuzzem)|Kee]], and their fellow [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Halla]]. During the chaos, Grammel was injured in an explosion resulting in a significant portion of his face being burned, his right arm having to be \"re-formed\" and his ear damaged. Upon Darth Vader's arrival, the Sith Lord was disappointed with Grammel over his failure to prevent them from escaping. Worse, Vader took over the command of Grammel's troops.\n\n[[File:GrammelDeath.jpg|thumb|250px|Grammel is killed by Darth Vader]]\nGrammel was ordered to seize the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] leaders, a task he failed to complete. Despite &mdash; or perhaps as a result of &mdash; his pleas and excuses, Grammel was bisected by [[Darth Vader's lightsaber/Legends|Darth Vader's lightsaber]] for his incompetence.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye 1|''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'' 1]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye 2|''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'' 2]]\n*[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye 3|''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'' 3]]\n*[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye 4|''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'' 4]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|captainsupervisorgrammel|Grammel, Captain-Supervisor|archivedate=20100203105217}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Grammel\n|es=Grammel\n|hu=Grammel\n|ru=\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mimban residents]]\n[[Category:Torturers and interrogators]]"}}}]}}}}
