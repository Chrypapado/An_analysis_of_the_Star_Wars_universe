Do better next time!|Scamp's father|Star Wars (1977) 89}}\n'''Scamp's father''' was the head of a large family that lived in the slums of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Solay]]. He was an abusive man that often struck out at his children, hitting them for no other reason than that they were in his way. As a result, his family was scared of him, and they often scattered when he entered a room. This man taught his children to steal, and his prized student was [[Scamp]], one of his older children. Although Scamp brought back large hauls of loot, his father was never impressed, deriding Scamp for not bringing back more.\n\n[[File:AbusiveFather.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Scamp's father strikes one of his children.]]\n\nAround [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Scamp's father witnessed [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and his son entering the slums with a haul of stolen goods. Scamp's father examined the goods, claiming that Scamp must have forgotten the tricks he had taught him, since he had brought back such a small amount. Skywalker attempted to intervene, but Scamp stopped him. Shortly thereafter, the two left the man's home.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 89|''Star Wars'' 89]] {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Solay residents]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Unidentified fathers]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]"}}}]}}}}
