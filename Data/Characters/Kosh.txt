Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], Kosh was stationed on his [[homeworld]] as the [[commander]] of the [[68th Legion]] of the [[Imperial Army]], the local [[garrison]]. During his tenure, Kosh created a [[Kosh's private smuggling operation|private smuggling operation]], overseeing the [[Operations on Tatooine|conflict]] against [[Jennica Pierce]]'s local [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] [[Tatooine rebel cell|cell]].<ref name=\"Commander\" />\n\nAt some point, a Rebel [[Saponza's partner|agent]] serving under Pierce managed to destroy [[Fort Sunfire]], one of the main Imperial garrisons on Tatooine. In retaliation, Kosh attacked the agent's [[Saponza's homestead|own base]] with an [[armored cavalry]] contingent comprising nine [[All Terrain Scout Transport]]s, one [[Elite AT-AT]], and two [[2-M Hover Tank]]s. The Rebels, however, survived Kosh's mechanized assault. As a result, the Imperial captain decided to attack again, sending half the 68th Legion to the Rebel base, but that second assault failed as well. With the full brunt of his [[troop]]s defeated, Kosh was forced to be on the defensive. Although he knew the location of the Rebel base, he simply could not attack it anymore. Those events effectively started a contained [[Battle for Tatooine|conflict]] between Kosh and the local Rebels.<ref name=\"Starwars.com\">[[Kekit]]'s Databank entry states that Saponza and his partner played an integral part in the campaign that liberated a Jawa clan from the Tusken Raiders. It also states that the plan was orchestrated by Jennica Pierce of the Rebel Alliance. This scenario does not occur if the player aligns with the Empire, so it can be deduced that Saponza's gang joined the Rebellion.</ref>\n\nSome [[time]] later, Kosh was made a [[Prefect (Galactic Empire)|prefect]]. However, in the [[Standard month|months]] that followed the Empire's major [[Battle of Endor|defeat]] at [[Endor]], he was captured by a [[Norra Wexley's team|team]] of [[Imperial hunter]]s led by [[pilot]] [[Norra Wexley]]. Kosh became a [[prisoner]] of the [[New Republic]], the [[Democracy|democratic]] government established by the Rebels.<ref name=\"LD\">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA light-skinned man with a straight [[nose]] and [[Color|blue]] [[eye]]s, Kosh would often pull a contemptuous expression. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, his once-black [[hair]] had become gray.<ref name=\"Commander\" /> To achieve the goals of the Empire, Kosh manipulated both his allies and enemies as pawns. He also had an unusual interest in ancient artifacts.<ref name=\"DB Kosh\">{{Databank|captain-kosh|Captain Kosh|archivedate=2017051715272}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nKosh wore the [[Imperial military uniforms|standard uniform]] of the [[Imperial Military]], which consisted of a double-breasted tunic with matching trousers, black [[leather]] [[belt]], black [[boot]]s, and a [[hat]]. On the left side of the upper chest, he sported the [[Rank insignia plaque|insignia]] of an army captain, featuring three red tiles over three blue ones. Although Kosh did not have any [[code cylinder]]s, his cap and belt were equipped with an [[Officer's disk|identity disc]].<ref name=\"Commander\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKosh is the character who assigns missions in ''[[Star Wars: Commander]]'' if the player chooses to align with the Empire. If the player chooses the Rebellion, they deal with [[Jennica Pierce]].<ref name=\"Commander\" />\n\nWhile ''Star Wars: Commander'' is his first [[canon]] appearance, Kosh originally appeared in the now-[[Star Wars Legends|Legends]] book ''[[Heroes in Hiding]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Commander]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''\n*{{Databank|captain-kosh|Captain Kosh|archivedate=2017051715272}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Kosh\n|fr=Kosh\n|ja=\u30b3\u30b7\u30e5\n|nl=Kosh\n|pl=Kosh\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u0448/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
