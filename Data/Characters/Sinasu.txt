He was a rival of the Hutt [[Noako]] and the pair became embroiled in a gang war. During the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Sinasu tasked a group of individuals who were indebted to him with [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] a cargo of [[Krayt dragon/Legends|Krayt dragon]] [[Egg/Legends|eggs]] and a small Krayt Dragon to Nar Shaddaa from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Sinasu went into hiding among the [[outlaw tech]] gang [[TechTank]], in [[TechTank shop|their shop]] in the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa, but the facility fell under attack from [[Cordol's Chain]], a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] group hired by Noako. The agents smuggling Sinasu's Krayt dragon arrived at the shop and rescued Sinasu, and at his direction they transported him to the little-used freight pad [[Spaceport 27]] on the planet [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], where his personal [[Light freighter/Legends|light freighter]] [[Red Nebula (starship)|''Red Nebula'']] was docked. To reward the agents for their efforts, Sinasu relieved them of a portion of the debt that they owed to him.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{FFG|book=Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beta|text=''Star Wars: Edge of the Empire'' Beta|story=Crates of Krayts|stext=''Crates of Krayts''}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Lords of Nal Hutta]]''\n\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Hutts of the Gorensla clan]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
