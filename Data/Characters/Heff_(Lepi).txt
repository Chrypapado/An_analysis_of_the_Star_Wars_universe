Sad ta see an oldster make da Final Jump.|Two locals discuss Heff's death.|Tatooine Manhunt}}\n'''Heff''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]] who emigrated to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] on one of the original [[Colony ship/Legends|colony ships]] that settled the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] in the early period of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"note\">Heff is stated to be a survivor of the \"original colony ships\", however Tatooine was first colonized in [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]]. It is more likely Heff is a survivor of the wave of colonists that arrived around [[85 BBY/Legends|85 BBY]]. As Lepi lifespan extends to around 100 years, this is the most likely arrival period.</ref> There, he set up a shop known as [[Heff's Souvenirs]], which he ran with his daughter [[Tebbi]]. Heff lived to be one of only three remaining colonists from those early [[Starship/Legends|ships]].<ref name=\"TM\" />\n\nIn [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Heff was killed by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Jodo Kast]] who shot him in the neck with a [[Sennari/Legends|sennari]]-[[Poison/Legends|poisoned]] dart. Kast was seeking the Rebel sympathizer [[Adar Tallon/Legends|Adar Tallon]] who had been hiding out on the planet for many [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. Kast slowly killed off all those that may have been alive when Tallon arrived to ensure they couldn't pass on any information to competing hunters. Upon his [[Death/Legends|death]], Tebbi&mdash;herself a Rebel sympathizer&mdash;shared what she could with a group of Rebels that were also seeking Tallon.<ref name=\"TM\" /> After a couple of seasons, she sold Heff's Souvenirs to the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Moplin Jarron]].<ref name=\"GG7\">''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHeff and his daughter were described in ''Tatooine Manhunt'' as \"rabbit-like alien[s].\" The name \"Heff\" was later used in the ''The Starhoppers of Aduba-3'' article as an example of a Lepi name, and in this manner his [[Species/Legends|species]] was revealed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|7|Passages}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Tatooine Manhunt]]'' {{1stm}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Classic Adventures: Volume Three|story=Tatooine Manhunt}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''\n*{{GamerCite|4|The Starhoppers of Aduba-3}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0425\u0435\u0444\u0444\n}}\n\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Lepi]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
