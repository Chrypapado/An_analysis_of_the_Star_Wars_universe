She was a high-ranking member who reported directly to [[Loppak Slusk]], chief of Exchange operations in the Telos sector based on the station. Luxa had [[Color/Legends|dark red]] hair and pink skin, most of which was visible due to her revealing fashion choices.\n\n==Biography==\nWhen [[Meetra Surik]] arrived on Citadel Station with [[Atton Rand]] and [[Kreia]] and made her way to the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] there, she was introduced to Luxa and [[Benok]], who was something of a rival of the Zeltron within the criminal group there as he was in charge of Slusk's \"muscle\". Later, after the party discovered the disappearance of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' while collecting their possessions at the [[Telos Security Force]]'s station, Luxa offered to introduce Surik and her party to Slusk. In a not-so-subtle manner, Luxa let on to Surik that she found her to be \"quite attractive\". She would only assist Surik if she removed the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] crime boss, thus allowing her to assume his position. In return, Luxa offered to assist in helping Surik find the ''Ebon Hawk''. However, the alliance was short-lived, as Luxa betrayed Surik in an attempt to cash in on [[G0-T0|Goto's]] [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on live Jedi, and was killed in the ensuing [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|battle]].\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJudging by her behavior towards Surik, Luxa was apparently composed, confident, and flirtatious, often speaking with a somewhat sultry, yet rather calm, mature and relaxed tone, giving the impression that she may have been somewhat laid-back and easy-going. She was also slightly devious, deceptive, and manipulative, based on her convincing of Surik to \"remove\" [[Loppak Slusk|her boss]] from power in the Bumani Exchange Corp, and in return, help find the then-missing ''Ebon Hawk'' ship, only to betray Surik at the last minute in an attempt to claim the Jedi bounty [[G0-T0|the Exchange boss]] had on them.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDuring a confrontation with Slusk, Luxa, and their respective bodyguards, Meetra Surik receives a counter-offer from Slusk, who tells her that \"all is forgiven\" if Surik kills Luxa. Four options become available:\n\nSurik agrees to Slusk's terms and attacks Luxa and her Gamorrean body guards (a task made somewhat easier with the help of Slusk's defense turrets).\n\nShe can also argue for a peaceful solution to the conflict, only to be attacked by Luxa.\n\nSurik can also kill Slusk (which gives no light or dark side points), only to have Luxa betray her. Luxa still answers to Slusk's superior, [[G0-T0|Goto]], and makes her own attempt at cashing in on Surik's bounty.\n\nShe may chose hostility to both; beyond facing both groups at once, the results are otherwise the same as the third.\n\nIf the player sides with [[Jana Lorso]], then Luxa will demand, as a test of good faith, that Surik conduct an arms deal in her stead. Surik agrees, and she is forced to kill the buyers when the deal goes sour. The buyers were intended to be members of the [[GenoHaradan]], but the lines relating to the organization were cut.\n\nLuxa will flirt with the Exile regardless of the gender chosen by the player. It's currently unknown whether this makes Luxa canonically bisexual.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Luxa#legends\n|es=Luxa\n|fr=Luxa\n|ru=\u041b\u0443\u043a\u0441\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:LGBTQ+ individuals]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]\n[[Category:Zeltrons]]"}}}]}}}}
