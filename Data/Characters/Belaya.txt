It was harsh and perhaps unfair. My Master often warns me I must learn to control my emotions. I see I have much left to learn.|Belaya, apologizing to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Belaya''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Jedi Guardian]] who resided in the [[Jedi Enclave]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. A [[Jedi training/Legends|student]] of the renowned [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zhar Lestin]], Belaya was devoted to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] traditions but struggled with controlling her emotions. She became very close to [[Juhani]], a [[Cathar/Legends|Cathar]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] whose emotions were similarly volatile.\n\nA test of humility devised by Juhani's Master, [[Quatra]], resulted in Juhani lashing out in anger and falling to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] when she mistakenly believed she had [[Death/Legends|killed]] her Master. After the fallen Padawan fled to the nearby [[Ancient Grove]], her dark emotions turned the surrounding [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] aggressive, but the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council]] would not permit Belaya to attempt to redeem her dear companion.\n\nWhen [[Revan]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who had [[Amnesia/Legends|lost]] his memories, arrived at the Jedi Enclave, Belaya confronted him about not being [[Clothing/Legends|dressed]] in [[Jedi apparel]], then apologized for her behavior. In Revan's final [[Jedi Initiate Trials|trial]] to become a Jedi once again, Master Lestin instructed him to confront and cleanse the darkness in the Ancient Grove. Revan spared Juhani and convinced her to return to the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]]. Afterward, Belaya expressed her gratitude to Revan for his actions, and she was reunited with Juhani until the redeemed Jedi joined Revan's quest to find the [[Star Forge]] and defeat [[Darth Malak]] and his [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I have come here to further my learning in the ways of the Force. Many Jedi come here to train under Master Zhar.|Belaya|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Zhar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Jedi Master Zhar Lestin taught many apprentices, including Belaya.]]\nBelaya was a young, [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] citizen of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> During the [[Time/Legends|time]]<ref name=\"CSWE Belaya\" /> that the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]&ndash;turned&ndash;[[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] battled the Republic<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> in the [[Jedi Civil War]],<ref name=\"KOTOR 2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref> Belaya sought a deeper knowledge of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and traveled to the [[Jedi Enclave]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zhar Lestin]], a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] male member of the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council]] there,<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] her as a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].<ref name=\"CSWE Belaya\" />\n\nAs Belaya continued her studies, she struggled with controlling her emotions, and her Master often reminded her that she must learn to do so. The [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] [[Juhani]], a fellow female Jedi learner, also had difficulties with managing her emotions. Throughout their time at the Enclave, Belaya and Juhani were dear companions to each other, spending many [[Local day/Legends|nights]] alone together under the [[Star/Legends|stars]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nBy [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Belaya had become a [[Jedi Guardian]], a path that focused more on [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|combat skills]] than [[Force power/Legends|mental abilities]] in service to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the Force. Meanwhile, Juhani had not yet completed her own training with Master [[Quatra]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n===Revan's return to Dantooine===\n====Traditions of the Jedi====\n{{Quote|You there! Padawan! Why are you not wearing the customary robes of the Jedi? Do you mock the honored traditions of our Order?|Belaya's first words to the amnesiac Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIn 3956 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> as part of a plan to end the Jedi Civil War, Jedi Padawan [[Bastila Shan]] brought the [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] Revan to the Enclave in order to convince its [[Jedi Council/Legends|Council]] to retrain him in the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]] as a Jedi again. As Revan headed toward the Council Chambers, Belaya sensed the power of the Force within him and assumed he was a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] learner who had come to the Enclave.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n[[File:BelayaEnclave.png|thumb|left|280px|Belaya at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine]]\nBelaya, not recognizing to whom she spoke, stopped Revan and demanded to know why he was not wearing the customary [[Jedi apparel]]. To Belaya, his [[Clothing/Legends|attire]] suggested he might have been mocking the Jedi traditions and neglecting his studies, but he explained that he was not a Jedi and was accompanying Shan. Belaya spoke of Shan's reputation as a master of [[battle meditation]], although she had also heard Shan took too much pride in her own abilities. As she could feel how strong the Force was within Revan, Belaya disbelieved his claim that he was not already part of the Jedi Order and suspected him of jesting in poor taste, accusations that Revan did not appreciate. Apologizing for how she had addressed him and acknowledging that she had much to learn, Belaya wished Revan well in his stay on Dantooine. Afterward, Revan completed several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] of apprentice training before being deemed ready for the three [[Jedi Initiate Trials|trials]] to become a Padawan.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nDuring his first two trials, Belaya congratulated Revan on his quick progress toward the rank of Padawan, which she had discussed with their mutual [[Teacher/Legends|teacher]], Master Lestin. Their teacher also advised Revan to journey to the [[Crystal Cave (Dantooine)|Crystal Cave]] on the [[Khoonda plains]] as he learned to alter his newly-constructed [[Revan's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. When Revan told Belaya he had heard about a cave with [[lightsaber crystal]]s, she warned the student that the cave was dangerous and he should not involve himself in matters that were beyond him. She wished him luck in his training and for [[May the Force be with you/Legends|the Force to be with him]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n====The fallen Jedi====\n{{Quote|Why? Because the Council believed that my closeness to her might do more harm than good&hellip;|Belaya, addressing why she did not go to Juhani|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Juhanimeditates.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Juhani, who was dear to Belaya, fell into darkness and fled to the Ancient Grove.]]\nBelaya's companion Juhani was tested by Master Quatra near the end of the Cathar's training, but she lashed out in anger and mistakenly believed she had [[Death/Legends|killed]] her Master. The enraged Juhani thus fell into darkness and fled to the nearby [[Ancient Grove]], which was tainted by her embrace of her dark power and had its surrounding [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] turn violent, attacking local [[Colonist/Legends|settlers]]. Because Belaya had always been close to Juhani, the Jedi Council would not allow her to approach the fallen Padawan, believing her intercession may be more harmful than helpful.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nIn the [[Standard day/Legends|days]] following Juhani's fall, Revan was assigned by Master Lestin to enter the Ancient Grove as part of his third and final trial. The Jedi trainee was to cleanse the Grove's darkness without the assistance of any other Jedi at the academy; thus, neither Revan's companion Shan nor his acquaintance Belaya could be involved.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n====The third trial====\n{{Quote|You have done a great thing. One of our own had strayed, but you returned Juhani to the Order. For this you deserve the highest praise.|Belaya, thanking Revan after his third trial|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nRevan approached the Grove and was ambushed by Juhani.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> Although he defeated her in their duel, he refused to kill her; instead, he convinced her to return to the Enclave and seek the judgement of the Council.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'' states that [[Juhani]] accompanied [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] on the search for the [[Star Forge]] and remained a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] after the end of the [[Jedi Civil War]], thus confirming that the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] outcome of the events involving Juhani in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' are the [[canon]]ical storyline.</ref> After the Council told Juhani the truth of Quatra's test and welcomed her return to the Jedi Order, Master Lestin informed Belaya of Revan's success in his trials.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nWhen Belaya spoke to Revan, she expressed her gratitude for his part in Juhani's redemption. After acknowledging the completion of his tests and the construction of his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], she cautioned him that he still had much to learn; as his power grew, he would struggle as other Jedi did with constant temptations to slip to the dark side.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n[[File:JuhaniBelayaEnclave.png|thumb|left|280px|Belaya and Juhani were reunited at the Enclave.]]\nBelaya and Juhani, reunited at the Enclave, spent time together in the courtyard that Belaya frequented while Revan investigated the [[Rakatan ruins (Dantooine)|ruins]] on Dantooine. Soon afterward, Juhani left Belaya to join Revan's quest to find the [[Star Forge]] and defeat [[Darth Malak]]. During their search, Malak's [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|bombarded]] the Enclave, resulting in many Jedi casualties. Malak was ultimately [[Battle of Rakata Prime|defeated by Revan]];<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> however, most members of the Jedi Order were killed by [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] forces during the subsequent [[First Jedi Purge|Jedi purge]].<ref name=\"KOTOR 2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|But as for you&hellip; you claim you are not a Padawan? I find this hard to believe. The Force is strong within you. I can feel its presence. If this is some type of jest, it is in very poor taste. The Jedi Order is not a subject for jokes.|Belaya, in her first conversation with Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:BelayaMad.png|thumb|right|200px|Belaya often had difficulty controlling her emotions.]]\nBelaya was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] female with a light skin tone, [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and brown [[Hair/Legends|hair]] that she styled in a sleek, short ponytail. She was devoted to honoring the Jedi traditions and saw some deviations as making a mockery of them; for instance, she thought it was inappropriate to make jokes about the Jedi Order and disapproved when others did not wear Jedi [[Robe/Legends|robes]]. Although she was critical of Bastila Shan's pride, Belaya displayed her own through the unsolicited advice she gave to Revan before he rejoined the Order. She saw sacrifice and discipline as ways to achieve mastery, but she had not mastered her own emotions despite repeated warnings that she must learn to do so. When she met Revan, she was quick to form judgments based on his attire and acknowledged her mistakes in how she approached him.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nBelaya shared a deep connection with Juhani, whom she described as her dear companion, and the Council was aware that they had always been close. When Juhani fell, the Council did not permit Belaya to attempt Juhani's redemption herself; that instead became a trial for Revan while Belaya remained in the Enclave. When Revan succeeded at returning Juhani to the light side, Belaya was joyous but composed in expressing her gratitude.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nIn accordance with Jedi custom, Belaya wore a standard brown robe with a white tunic underneath, along with brown pants and dark [[Glove/Legends|gloves]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n===Origin===\nBelaya appeared in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', developed by [[BioWare]]. She does not have a unique visual appearance, instead wearing robes common to other Jedi and sharing a head with several other female Human non-player characters. Belaya's first dialogue occurs in an unavoidable encounter when the player enters the Enclave courtyard for the first time, but further interactions are optional and dependent upon the status of other quests.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> The character Juhani and the quests on Dantooine were primarily written by [[Peter Thomas]],<ref name=\"LinkedIn\">{{LinkedIn|url=in/peter-thomas-63571011|text=Peter Thomas|archiveurl=https://archive.is/yFhef}}</ref> whose notes are found in Belaya's game files.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n===Gameplay alternatives===\n====On Dantooine====\n{{Quote|The Juhani I knew deserved more than this! She deserved more from the Council, and more from you! You&hellip; you did not even try, did you? Did it even occur to you that Juhani might have been saved? That she might be worth saving?

Belaya is one of the characters who can teach it to them, along with Jedi Knight [[Deesra Luur Jada]] or Masters Dorak, [[Vrook Lamar]], or [[Vandar Tokare]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nIf the player completed the Jedi trials by saving Juhani, Belaya can later offer commentary on two possible outcomes of the optional [[Sandral-Matale feud]] sidequest. Regarding the dark side option that leads to members of the [[Sandral family|Sandral]] and the [[Matale family|Matale families]] killing each other and the player battling the [[Sentinel droid|Matale droids]], Belaya wonders what dark force could have destroyed so many [[Droid/Legends|droids]] and killed so many people. If the player convinces the lovers [[Rahasia Sandral]] and [[Shen Matale]] to flee together to the Enclave instead of reconciling with their families, Belaya is glad that the player helped the couple find a way to remain together. Notes in her Dantooine dialogue tree indicate she was planned to comment if the player convinced Matale to return to his [[Ahlan Matale|father]] or completed the light side option where the parents accepted the couple, but no lines were scripted for those outcomes.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nIn the non-[[canon]] storylines, the player can kill Juhani at the Ancient Grove, and an unavoidable encounter with Belaya will trigger upon returning to the Enclave. Belaya is heartbroken and furious at the player and the Jedi Council for their roles in Juhani's death. She believes Revan did not give Juhani a chance and that the Council should have sent a more experienced Jedi. To Belaya, they all failed to believe Juhani deserved better and was worth saving. Regardless of the player's intentions, Belaya cannot be consoled for her loss and Revan cannot stop her from running away.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nAfter Belaya's disappearance, the player can ask Vandar or Vrook about her. Vandar will express his concerns that she may have done something rash, saying of her, \"She had always been close to Juhani, and her death may have hit Belaya&hellip; hard.\" Vrook will observe that Belaya failed to show up for a lesson with Master Lestin and was seen leaving the Enclave; he does not know where she may have gone and warns against forcing her to return should the player encounter her.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n====On Korriban====\n{{Quote|I am Belaya, once of the Jedi but now of the Sith&hellip; it was your murder of Juhani that placed this bitter blackness in my heart!|Belaya, as a Sith|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Belayadarkside.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Belaya falls to the dark side if Revan kills Juhani.]]\nIf Revan killed Juhani on Dantooine, another automatic encounter with Belaya occurs during the quest to find the Star Map on the Outer Rim Sith world of [[Korriban]]. Belaya fell to the dark side after Juhani's death and became a student at the [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]]. Wearing a [[Dark Jedi robe|dark Jedi Knight robe]], Belaya confronts Revan at the Academy's entrance and angrily questions their presence. She threatens to expose them if they are acting on behalf of the Jedi Council. Regardless of Revan's words, combat with Belaya is unavoidable; she ignites her red-bladed lightsaber and attempts to avenge Juhani. She has learned dark side abilities, such as wounding through [[Telekinesis/Legends|choking]] and [[Force lightning/Legends|electrical shocks]], manipulating minds to [[Force Slow|slow]] another's thoughts or [[Mind trick/Legends|produce fear]], and [[Force drain/Legends|draining life]] from others to heal herself. After killing her, Revan can loot [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], a [[droid shield]], and [[Echani battle armor]] from her body.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nIf Dantooine has not yet been attacked, Revan can return there and tell Master Lamar of Belaya's fate. Disturbed by her fall and considering it a failing of the Jedi as her teachers, Lamar cautions Revan not to give in to darkness lest they experience a fate similar to Belaya's.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n===Authorial intent===\n{{Quote|<nowiki />''[Juhani]'' talks around it.
