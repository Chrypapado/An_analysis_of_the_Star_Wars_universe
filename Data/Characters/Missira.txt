When young Tarasin started going to the academy, the elders were concerned that they would not cope well with life away from [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] and the tribes. Mother Missira was chosen to go to Almas and gather the students into a tribe to ease their transition into the greater [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. It proved to be a successful strategy.\n\nAfter the academy's chef [[Droid/Legends|droid]], [[O2-C4]], was accidentally destroyed, Mother Missira took upon herself the role of head chef for the academy. Although another droid was ordered, everybody was so happy with her cooking that nobody wanted it to arrive.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMissira was fond of children, and enjoyed being able to teach them their cultural heritage while they studied the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi's]] way of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Missira had developed her own quirky sense of humor after coming to Almas. She had a sort of friendship with [[E1-6RA]], helping the droid out with its administrative duties, although she found E1's attempts at humor to be lacking.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Philology]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020228aacademy&c=swlfc|text=Into the Academy|int=Into the Academy|archivedate=20030803001756}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]"}}}]}}}}
