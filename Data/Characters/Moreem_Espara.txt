She was sent by [[Queen Mother]] [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]] to serve as [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo's]] command liaison and advisor onboard the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']] when he went to arrest [[Ducha]] [[AlGray]]. Later, Jacen would [[Telekinesis/Legends#Choking Powers|Force choke]] her when she questioned his orders. She was released from the choke after Jacen thought he made his point. Espara escorted [[Allana Solo|Allana]] back to [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]] after the defeat of Hapan Heritage Council. After the [[Duel in the Royal Hangar|brief duel]] between [[Leia Organa Solo]] and [[Tahiri Veila]] on Hapes, she escorted Tahiri back to her [[StealthX]] and had her cloaking unit removed to ensure she didn't sneak back to Hapes on the orders of the Queen Mother, after making those suggestions personally.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Moreem Espara\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Espara, Moreem}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hapans]]"}}}]}}}}
