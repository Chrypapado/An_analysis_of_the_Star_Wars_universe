He left to become a ship's boy and was aware of the [[Ssi-ruu]]k before their [[invasion of Bakura]]. He owned the ''[[Silver Cratsch]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nBix fled a pampered life on his family's estate in southern [[Prytis]] to sign on as ship's boy for a [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] out of nearby [[Gymelo]]. By the time of the Sii-ruuvi invasion of Bakura, he knew more about the [[Shiritoku Spur|Shiritoku]] worlds than maybe any being in the galaxy, and was notorious for telling anyone who would listen that vicious aliens haunted the Spur's fringes. At some point, Bix mellowed toward his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and returned to buy his own [[namana]] plantation and even deigning to reenter [[Salis D'aar/Legends|Salis D'aar]] society, which found him rather dashing.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBix Arden-Govia presented a cool front to newcomers but was easily drawn out by anyone looking for a good [[Spacer/Legends|spacer's]] tale.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arden-Govia, Bix}}\n[[Category:Bakurans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
