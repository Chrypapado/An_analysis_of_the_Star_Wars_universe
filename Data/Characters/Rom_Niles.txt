Later, he was captured by the Republic along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals on [[M'Bardi]] and would be shipped to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. While been guarded by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]], the cruiser was attacked by [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] under the command of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]]. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Knowing that the ship was going to be destroyed very soon, Valon was among the prisoners to cooperate with the Jedi. He versed with the Republic guns and destroyed several Vulture-class droid fighters that were circling around the damaged ship. The ship was finally repaired and moved safely through Republic space. Skywalker thanked the prisoners for helping and guaranteed their aid will affect their parole.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCWUKCite|6.30|Out}} {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rom Niles\n|nl=Rom Niles\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Niles, Rom}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
