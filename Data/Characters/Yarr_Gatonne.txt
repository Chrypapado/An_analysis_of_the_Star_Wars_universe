He had been trained by his [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Resh Gatonne]], also a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunter. Sophisticated and calm, Yarr Gatonne respected life and would rather deliver a living, captured acquisition than a [[Death/Legends|dead]] one. If forced to kill, he did so quickly. His preferred approach was to use extortion and disguise to approach a target. His skills were complemented with [[Cyborg/Legends|cybernetically-improved]] eyesight because he had a [[Hifold Sensory Package]] in place of his right [[Eye/Legends|eye]].\n\nAlthough not officially affiliated with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Gatonne accepted Imperial contracts on agents of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], he fought Rebel [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Sestria]]. After the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Gatonne also tracked members of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], but the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]] was unable to confirm whether the Empire was behind the contracts.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I, myself, once had a run-in with Gatonne several years ago on the banking world of Sestria.|General Airen Cracken|Wanted by Cracken}}\nBorn in [[28 BBY/Legends|28 BBY]]<ref name=\"WC Dates\" /> on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Bonadan/Legends|Bonadan]],<ref name=\"WBC\" /> Yarr Gatonne was the son and apprentice of [[Resh Gatonne]], a retired [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. Yarr Gatonne was raised to use his [[Parent/Legends|father's]] unorthodox approach to understanding the environment, and he also followed Resh's footsteps by becoming a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunter. At some point during his early [[Standard year/Legends|years]], he replaced his right [[Eye/Legends|eye]] with an unrecognizable [[Cyborg/Legends|cybernetic]] [[Neuro-Saav Corporation|Neuro-Saav]] [[Hifold Sensory Package]] that improved his eyesight and other senses.<ref name=\"GG\" />\n\nDuring the years before the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Gatonne operated mainly in the [[Testarr sector]]. He was officially an independent bounty hunter unaffiliated with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], although he possessed a valid [[Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate/Legends|Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate]].<ref name=\"GG\" /> Despite his independence, Gatonne&mdash;like many others in his position&mdash;accepted Imperial payments for jobs against agents of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Several years prior<ref name=\"WBC\" /> to [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]],<ref name=\"WC Dates\" /> Gatonne tracked a Rebel agent, [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]], through the [[Crystal spires]] of the banking planet [[Sestria]]. Though Cracken escaped Gatonne, the Rebel was impressed by the bounty hunter's skill.<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\nIn 7 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY]],<ref name=\"WC Dates\" /> Yarr Gatonne operated not only in the Testarr sector, but also in the neighboring trade zones. Gatonne accepted new contracts on [[Engineer/Legends|engineers]], [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomats]] and military [[Commander/Legends|commanders]] working for the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. The [[New Republic Intelligence Service]] discovered Gatonne's activities and, while they could not confirm whether the Empire had sanctioned the contracts or not, they believed this was the case.<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:YarrGatonne-GG10.png|thumb|right|150px|Yarr Gatonne]]\n{{Quote|Do not underestimate this man's abilities.|General Airen Cracken|Wanted by Cracken}}\nYarr Gatonne was an obsessive individual who respected all life but regularly risked his own. Taking no sadistic pleasure when injuring others, he preferred capturing prey alive and, when the contract stipulated [[Death/Legends|death]], he executed the victim expeditiously. He preferred to use subterfuge and disguise,<ref name=\"GG\" /> particularly when tracking members of the Alliance or the New Republic. Gatonne captured associates of his victim to question them, and then impersonated the kidnapped individual to approach the prey; but he also utilized bribery, combat and hired [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]].<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\nGatonne was calm and sophisticated, and he had a forceful presence. He was an excellent fighter and tracker, as well as a skilled [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and a master of disguise. His ability to observe and analyze his environment were improved by his cybernetic enhancement, as were his [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] abilities.<ref name=\"WBC\" /><ref name=\"GG\" /> Gatonne was known to collect rare, valuable gems, sometimes accepting dangerous tasks if a valuable item of that kind was to be obtained.<ref name=\"GG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYarr Gatonne was first mentioned in ''[[Wanted by Cracken]]'', a [[1993]] [[Roleplaying game|role-playing]] sourcebook for [[West End Games]]' ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]''. The book was written by [[Louis J. Prosperi]] and included an image of Gatonne drawn by [[Mike Jackson]].<ref name=\"WBC\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wanted by Cracken]]'' {{1stm}}<!--1993 Jun-->\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 10: Bounty Hunters]]'' <!--1994 Mar-->\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Yarr Gatonne}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gatonne, Yarr}}\n[[Category:Bonadanians]]\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
