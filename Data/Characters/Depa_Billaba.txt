She'd never let you get away with&mdash;''\"<br />\"''All the things you tried to get away with?|Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger|Path of the Jedi}}\n'''Depa Billaba''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Gender|female]] [[Chalactan|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Chalacta]], was a [[Jedi Master]] who served on the [[Jedi High Council]] during the final [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Jedi Order]]. She was [[Reproduction|born]] on Chalacta and became a member of the Order at a young age, where she was [[Jedi training|trained]] by [[Jedi]] Master [[Mace Windu]]. Billaba was later appointed to the Council alongside her former teacher and was present when Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] presented [[Anakin Skywalker]], the [[Chosen One]], to the governing body. She later attended [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|Jinn's funeral]] after the Jedi Master was killed during the [[Battle of Naboo]].\n\nBillaba continued to serve as a member of the Council during the [[Separatist Crisis|political crisis]] that led to the [[Clone Wars]], a pan-[[The galaxy|galactic]] civil war between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. During the war, she took [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]] as her [[Padawan]] learner. After the [[Conquest of Kaller]], the two were attacked by Billaba's [[battalion]] of [[clone trooper]]s after the execution of [[Order 66]], a secret protocol branding all Jedi as enemies of the state. Due to Billaba's [[Death|sacrifice]], Dume survived the [[Great Jedi Purge]] and went into hiding under a new name&mdash;Kanan Jarrus. Initially traveling low and taking odd jobs, he eventually joined [[Spectres|a group of rebels]] who opposed the [[Galactic Empire]]. Although Jarrus hid his true identity as a Jedi for years, he remembered his Master with fondness. After adopting [[Ezra Bridger]] as an apprentice, Jarrus initially relied on his own incomplete training under Billaba in order to teach Bridger the ways of the Jedi and [[the Force]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nDepa Billaba was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Chalacta]] many [[Standard year|years]] prior to the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name=\"The Secret Jedi\" /> [[Gender|She]] had a sister, [[Sar Labooda]].<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> As a [[Youngling|child]], she was held as a captive by space [[pirate]]s who [[Death|killed]] her [[parent]]s.<ref name=\"SWCEUE\" /> She was rescued by [[Mace Windu]], a member of the [[Jedi Order]], and he brought her into the Order. Billaba became Windu's [[Padawan]] and [[Jedi training|trained]] under the [[Jedi Master]] in the ways of [[the Force]] until becoming a [[Jedi Knight]]. She was renowned for her skills with a [[lightsaber]]<ref name=\"The Secret Jedi\" /> and favored [[Form III]] when teaching other [[Jedi]].<ref name=\"Rise of the Old Masters\">{{Rebels|Rise of the Old Masters}}</ref>\n\n===Life as a Jedi===\n====Helping Mace Windu====\nAfter several children were kidnapped by the [[warlord]] [[Guattako]] on [[Oosalon]], Windu was sent to find and rescue the missing children. Eventually, Windu was able to defeat all of [[Guattako's army]]. When he [[Lightsaber duel|dueled]] with Guattako, Guattako used his [[staff]] to knock Windu out. When Guattako was about to kill Windu, a child shot and killed Guattako. Shortly after, Billaba, [[Plo Koon]], and [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] arrived to help.<ref name=\"The Weapon\">{{Shortstory|story=The Weapon|book=Age of Republic Special 1}}</ref>\n\n====Invasion of Naboo====\n[[File:High_Council_Chamber.png|thumb|left|252x252px|Billaba (foreground, right) and the Jedi Council test Skywalker for possible Jedi training.]]\nEventually, Billaba was given a seat on the [[Jedi High Council]], serving alongside Windu. During the [[Invasion of Naboo]], she was present in the [[Jedi Council Chamber|Council chambers]] of the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] when Jinn told the story of how he [[Duel on Tatooine|encountered]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] on [[Tatooine]], and how Jinn believed that Maul was a [[Sith Lord]]; Maul had been attempting to capture [[Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo]]. The Jedi Master also revealed he had found [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young [[Slavery|slave]] he had freed on the [[desert]] planet, and that he believed the boy was the [[Chosen One]] destined to destroy the [[Sith]] and bring balance to the Force. The Council was skeptical of both claims but nonetheless agreed to test the boy and investigate [[Darth]] Maul. Despite being impressed with Skywalker's abilities, the Council initially rejected Jinn's request that the boy be admitted into the Jedi Order, on the basis that Skywalker was too old to begin Jedi training. They instead ordered that Jinn and his apprentice, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], travel to Naboo to protect [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] Amidala, who was returning to her planet to fight back against the [[Trade Federation]] invasion.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nThe Federation's invasion and occupation ended during a [[Battle of Naboo|battle]] to retake the planet. Maul mortally wounded Jinn in [[lightsaber combat]], before Kenobi gravely wounded the Sith [[Lord]]; Maul went into [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] and would not be heard from again for many years. Jinn's dying wish was that Kenobi train Skywalker as a Jedi, a wish that the Council agreed to. Billaba and other members of the Jedi Council traveled to Naboo and attended [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|Jinn's funeral]], before taking part in a ceremony marking a newfound peace between the [[human]]s and [[Gungan]]s of Naboo; the Federation, as a common enemy, brought the once-feuding peoples together.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n===Disaster at Bromlarch===\nMaster Billaba was the Jedi representative on the Republic's survey to the planet [[Bromlarch]] alongside Senators [[Mina Bonteri]], [[Rush Clovis]], and Amidala. They traveled with the planet's representative [[Caelor Gaans]] to analyze the damage to the aqueducts after a devastating groundquake. Billaba joined their ship for an orbital review. During the mission, the Jedi made sure to speak to Amidala, who she had met in the aftermath of the Invasion of Naboo four years earlier.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\">''[[Queen's Shadow]]''</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Billaba flew a Delta-7 starfighter as an escort for a supply run, with the callsign ''[[Hazard Three]]''. She flew interference for the convoy and Amidala's starship against the attacking pirates before they were able to escape.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n{{Quote|My young strategist has been thinking again.|Billaba, to Caleb Dume, after the training session with Obi-Wan Kenobi|A New Dawn (novel)}}\nSix years later, the [[Separatist Crisis|Secessionist Movement]] plunged the [[Galactic Republic]] into a [[Politics|political]] crisis, with thousands of [[star system]]s seceding from the Republic and joining the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]; the conflict was designed by [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] publicly known as [[Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine, as part of a plot to destroy the Jedi Order and take over [[the galaxy]]. Billaba was present on the Jedi Council when the body ordered Kenobi to investigate the [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|plot]] to [[assassin]]ate now-[[Senator]] Amidala, an outspoken opponent of the [[Military Creation Act]] that would have allowed the Republic to raise an [[Grand Army of the Republic|army]] to combat the Separatists; Skywalker was further ordered to travel with Amidala to Naboo so she could be protected from harm. These events led Kenobi to discover a [[Cloning|clone]] [[army]] built for the Republic in secret on [[Kamino]], and the [[Galactic Senate]] to grant Chancellor Palpatine emergency executive power. The Chancellor enlisted the clones as the Grand Army of the Republic, and they were put to use in the [[First Battle of Geonosis]], which sparked the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatists&mdash;just as Sidious had intended.<ref name=\"Episode II\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Her sister, Labooda, was killed during the battle.<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" />\n\n====Attack on Mahranee====\nBillaba was present on the Council whilst watching a live [[Hologram|holographic]] recording of the devastating Separatist [[Atrocity on Mahranee|attack]] on [[Mahranee]], the [[homeworld]] of the [[Mahran]] [[species]]. Following the attack, Windu convinced Billaba and the rest of the council on a secret mission to assassinate [[Count]] [[Dooku]]. At the suggestion of Kenobi, the Council recruited [[Quinlan Vos]], who was experienced in undercover work, and Dooku's former apprentice [[Asajj Ventress]] for this sensitive operation. Ventress agreed to assist Vos with the mission but insisted that the Jedi could only overcome Dooku by training in the ways of the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]].<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>\n\n====Damaged goods====\n[[File:Bacta_Tank_Billaba.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Billaba in a coma at the Jedi Temple's medical center.]]\nAt some point, [[Jedi General|General]] Billaba and her [[troop]]s [[Battle of Haruun Kal|faced]] [[General]] [[Grievous]],<ref name=\"Kanan 9\">[[Kanan 9|''Kanan'' 9]]</ref> a [[Kaleesh]] [[cyborg]] who was the [[Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies|Supreme Commander of the Droid Army]],<ref name=\"SWCEUE\" /> on [[Haruun Kal]].<ref name=\"Kanan 9\" /> That [[Standard day|day]], the Jedi Master's [[Depa Billaba's battalion|battalion]] suffered ninety percent casualties. Billaba herself was badly injured, to the point that she fell in a [[coma]]. After six [[Standard month|months]] of constant care at the [[Jedi temple]]'s [[Medical bay|infirmary]], she came out of her coma, seeming to have made a full physical recovery. The senior members of the Jedi High Council feared that her mental and emotional state might still be too damaged. Consequently, Billaba underwent a full fitness assessment. When it appeared that she had indeed fully recovered, Billaba was allowed to resume her position in the High Council.<ref name=\"Kanan 7\" />\n\nFollowing her reinstatement, Billaba took an interest in a [[Jedi Initiate|Jedi youngling]] named [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], whose questioning nature caught her attention.<ref name=\"A New Dawn\" /> She was impressed by Dume's questioning about how the Jedi Knights chose their Padawans when she and Windu were in the [[Jedi Archives]]. Billaba then instructed Dume, [[Sammo Quid]], and [[Tai Uzuma]] in Form III defensive poses.<ref name=\"Kanan 7\" />\n\nBillaba was present during a group training session in which Kenobi, now a Jedi Master and a member of the Jedi Council, told a group of younglings, including Dume, about a [[Jedi beacon|beacon]] in the [[Jedi Temple central security station|Jedi Temple's central security station]] that could call all Jedi back to [[Coruscant]] in [[time]]s of great crisis. Dume asked the Jedi Master if it could be used to warn Jedi away from Coruscant, a thought that Kenobi had never entertained, and that caused concern and commotion amongst the assembled younglings. Billaba attempted to stop Dume from his line of questioning, but Kenobi encouraged him and speculated that the beacon could indeed be used to warn Jedi away in times of unexpected peril. Billaba saw Dume, as she had in the past, as having a mind for strategy, and at the end of the session, Billaba was once again impressed by him.<ref name=\"A New Dawn\" />\n\nDespite her recovery and her reinstatement to the High Council, some of the [[clone trooper]]s started spreading the word that General Billaba was \"damaged goods.\" This rumor reached Caleb Dume who decided to directly ask the Jedi Master. The two were discussing whether she was \"damaged goods\" despite her recovery, but their discussion was interrupted when they sensed [[Kage Warriors|something]] and saw [[thermal detonator]]s outside her quarters.<ref name=\"Kanan 7\" />\n\n====Jedi Temple Bombing====\n{{Quote|It seems I am in desperate need of a Padawan in order to continue my journey.|Depa Billaba, to Caleb Dume|Kanan 8}}\n[[File:Billaba_Dume_Temple_Roof_Kanan8.png|thumb|left|266x266px|Billaba and Dume atop the Jedi Temple roof after stopping Rackham Sear.]]\nBillaba then took Dume and fled her quarters when the [[Bombing at the Jedi Temple|bombs]] went off.

Billaba saved Dume and prevented Sear from setting off his bombs.<ref name=\"Kanan 8\">[[Kanan 8|''Kanan'' 8]]</ref> When Sear refused her offer to surrender, they fought until he jumped off the roof and threw bombs at her and Dume.

Billaba valued Dume's strategic mind and encouraged him to put it to good use.<ref name=\"A New Dawn\" /> At some point, Billaba brought Dume to one of the thousands of Jedi Temples in the galaxy in order to undergo a rite of passage in which he would need to face and overcome his greatest fears.<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\">{{Rebels|Path of the Jedi}}</ref> Three [[Standard week|weeks]] after the Jedi temple bombing, Billaba took Dume to get a [[Kyber crystal]]<ref name=\"Kanan 8\" /> and construct [[Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber|his lightsaber]].<ref name=\"Rebellion Begins\">''[[The Rebellion Begins]]''</ref>\n\n====Skirmish on Kardoa====\n{{Quote|I'm ready for that briefing, Commander.

Billaba, Styles, Dume, and [[CT-1157|Stance]] were outnumbered but were able to clear the mesas. They became surrounded during another attack, and Billaba called Grey for an extraction. She and the others fought the droids as they came, but there were too many. They were then saved when [[Skull Leader]] [[Fenn Rau]] and [[Skull Squadron]] bought them more time and were evacuated, but Billaba never got to meet or thank Fenn Rau in person to thank him for saving their lives.<ref name=\"Kanan 10\">[[Kanan 10|''Kanan'' 10]]</ref>\n\nBillaba returned to the base camp. However, the camp came under attack by battle droids led by [[Colonel]] Sear and General Grievous.<ref name=\"Kanan 10\" /> Billaba fought Grievous, cutting off two of his hands. However, Grievous was able to wound her. Despite that, she continued fighting until Dume, Styles, and Grey came to aid her. Grievous and his forces retreated.

Billaba and her [[Republic Military|forces]] were able to rout Kleeve's forces and forced his retreat. Billaba then spoke with [[Gamut Key]], assuring him that his village would no longer be forced into giving them supplies and labor. Billaba and her troops billeted outside of Key's village.<ref name=\"Kanan 1\" />\n\nThat night, Billaba took Dume out for a training session, lamenting that she had been neglecting him. After working with Form III until after sunset,  Billaba presented her Padawan with a [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron|holocron]], telling him to use it to explore and satisfy his inquisitiveness. They returned to the camp and relaxed at a fire with Grey, Styles, and the men. They discussed the role of questions in regard to orders and to the Jedi Order, at which Billaba gave Dume a [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron|holocron]]. He was to use it to \"study the role of questions\" and \"peaceful dissent\" in the Order.<ref name=\"Kanan 1\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the pivotal [[Battle of Coruscant]], General Grievous and the Separatists launched a massive offensive across several star systems, including on Kaller. Billaba and her men became pinned down by [[Armored Assault Tank Mk I|Armored Assault Tanks]] outside of the snowy woodlands as Dume left to contact reinforcements. Billaba and her men were saved by [[Clone Force 99]]. As their leader, Clone Sergeant [[Hunter]] recommended they launch a counter-attack, Billaba agreed and gathered her men to move out, allowing Dume to proceed on ahead with Hunter and his squad.<ref name=\"TBB Aftermath\">{{TBB|Aftermath (episode)|Aftermath}}</ref>\n\n====Order 66====\n{{Quote|You must run!

As Billaba's men formed up, they began to surround her and fire on her. Billaba became overwhelmed, and as her Padawan realized what was happening and turned back to help her, she instead told Dume to run. Billaba bravely stood her ground as Dume looked on in horror, and as she lost her lightsaber, she was quickly killed. Dume fled into the woods, unaware that most of Clone Force 99 were just as confused as to what was transpiring as he was.
