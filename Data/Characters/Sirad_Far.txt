After the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] helped Sirad by eliminating his rivals, the skilled slicer became indebted to his [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|criminal empire]]. Under Jabba's employ, Sirad assumed responsibility for a variety of tasks, including reformatting a [[Hyperspace transponder|transponder]] to function on Jabba's personal [[Starship/Legends|starship]], and decoding a ledger that contained sensitive information regarding a rival [[Valarian gang|gang]] led by [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Valarian/Legends|Valarian]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n===Eliminating the Competition===\n{{Quote|Okay, look, Jabba is missing a slicer since his last one had a little bit of an accident with the rancor. Well, Jabba wants this one slicer, Sirad Far, in his pocket and he knows the best way to do it would be to help take out Sirad's rivals.|Ree-Yees to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the [[Time/Legends|time]] following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] seeking employ with [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|criminal empire]] carried out a number of odd jobs for [[Ree-Yees/Legends|Ree-Yees]], a [[Gran/Legends|Gran]] member of Jabba's court on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. After losing [[Gender/Legends|his]] last [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] to his pet [[Jabba's rancor|rancor]], the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] had been searching for a replacement. One suitable prospect was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] male criminal named Sirad Far. According to Jabba's [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Majordomo/Legends|majordomo]] [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna]], Sirad Far was one of the best slicers on Tatooine. Jabba wanted Sirad in his pocket, but to accomplish that, Jabba needed to help eliminate the slicer's rivals. Ree-Yees ultimately tasked this responsibility to the spacer attempting to curry favor with Jabba. In exchange for a [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] reward, the spacer embarked to eliminate [[Raf Daris]], a rival of Sirad's who worked as a thief for the [[Valarian gang]], an organization led by the [[Whiphid/Legends|Whiphid]] crime boss known as [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Valarian/Legends|Valarian]]. The Valarian's also happened to be one of the greatest threats to Jabba's power on Tatooine. Despite being ambushed by three additional Valarian thieves attempting to defend Raf Daris, the spacer succeeded in [[Death/Legends|killing]] all four of the rival gang members. Accomplishing this goal earned Sirad's loyalty, and indebted him to Jabba's criminal empire.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Transponder Delivery===\n{{Quote|Good news, worrt. Jabba says that transponder is exactly what he was looking for. Now Jabba is going to see if this Sirad Far guy was worth all the effort. Take the transponder to Sirad Far so he can slice into the codes on this thing, okay?|Ree-Yees to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter a [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] crashed in the [[Desert/Legends|dunes]] near [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]], Ree-Yees tasked the spacer who had helped him before with recovering its [[Hyperspace transponder|transponder]]. At first, Ree-Yees did not care to reveal why Jabba wanted the transponder. Nevertheless, as soon as it was recovered, he tasked the spacer, who he derogatively referred to as a \"[[Worrt/Legends|worrt]]\", with delivering it to Sirad Far. Ree-Yees eventually revealed that the ship that crashed near the palace met the same specifications as Jabba's own personal starship. Ree-Yees surmised that Jabba wanted the transponder hooked up on his ship, so that he could transmit a false identity whenever he wanted. However, to accomplish that, Ree-Yees required prompt delivery of the transponder package to Sirad. Despite being ambushed by thugs along the way, the spacer managed to rendezvous with Sirad at a scheduled meeting area near Jabba's Palace. Sirad Far offered his assurances that the transponder would meet Jabba's expectations.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Lady Valarian's Ledger===\n{{Quote|Jabba's spies are morons. None of 'em knew that the ledger was written in code. Valarian is using an obscure form of Old Drall in that book, an' nobody here can read it. Fortunately, Jabba has a big brain named Sirad Far on the payroll. Jabba's been helpin' Far with a few of his problems, and now Sirad's more than happy to read the ledger for the Hutt..|Ephant Mon to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nRee-Yees commended the spacer for the successful completion of the \"Sirad Far deal,\" as he called it. For their part in the deal, the spacer was awarded a piece of [[Mabari/Legends|Mabari]] [[Armorweave/Legends|armorweave]]. However, this would not be the last time Sirad Far found himself involved with Jabba's criminal enterprise. Another member of Jabba's court, a [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] by the name of [[Ephant Mon/Legends|Ephant Mon]], found himself in possession of a ledger stolen from a [[Courier/Legends|courier]] working for Jabba's rival, Lady Valarian. The ledger contained financial information from Valarian's [[Lucky Despot|compound]], which Ephant Mon believed could be used to ruin her. Unfortunately for Jabba and his ilk however, the ledger was written in code using an obscure form of a [[Language/Legends|language]] known as [[Old Drall]]. No one in Jabba's Palace knew how to read it, but Sirad Far was on Jabba's payroll, and had the expertise needed to read the ledger for the Hutt crime lord. Because Jabba had been very helpful to Sirad in eliminating some of his problematic rivals, he was more than willing to return the favor. However, delivering the ledger to Sirad was a dangerous prospect. According to Jabba's [[Spy/Legends|spies]], Lady Valarian was enraged by its theft. To halt any attempt to decode the ledger's information, a Valarian [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] was dispatched to kill the spacer. However, this last ditch effort was an exercise in futility. The spacer managed to kill the Valarian gang member, before locating Sirad Far to hand over the ledger. Fortunately for Jabba, Sirad's skills lived up to his expectations, and he made quick work of decoding the sensitive information. The pleased Ephant Mon gifted the spacer responsible for delivering the ledger one of two [[Painting/Legends|paintings]], including either an [[advertisement]] depicting the [[Pa'lowick/Legends|Pa'lowick]] [[Sy Snootles/Legends|Sy Snootles]], or a ''[[Portrait of a Twi'lek Female]]''.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Hey, are you the guy old Reesy-Yeesy sent?|Sirad Far to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nSirad Far had fair skin, brown [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and gray [[Color/Legends|colored]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] with brown eyebrows.<ref name=\"AED\" /> He possessed at least some skill in [[unarmed combat]].<ref name=\"Total\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref><ref name=\"Complete\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> Highly intelligent, Bib Fortuna considered him to be one of the best slicers on the entire planet of Tatooine.

Sirad had a chipper demeanor, but he could at times be ruthless. He relied on Jabba to eliminate his troublesome rivals, a deed for which he remained greatly thankful. Owing a debt to Jabba thereafter, Sirad remained on Jabba's payroll, and was readily willing to aid the crime lord whenever the need arose.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|That transponder should be just fine for Jabba's purposes.|Sirad Far to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nSirad Far was unarmed.<ref name=\"Complete\" /> During his time on Tatooine, working at the behest of Jabba the Hutt, Sirad wore a white short sleeve [[Jacket/Legends|jacket]] over top a red casual [[shirt]].
