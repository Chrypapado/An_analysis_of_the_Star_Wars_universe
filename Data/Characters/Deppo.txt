As a child he developed a passion for repairing and dabbling with mechanical constructs of all kinds. However, he was very defiant and soon fell in with a local gang, which would eventually lead to him being kicked out of his home by his parents. Left on his own, Deppo began making a life for himself until an incident caused him to begin working for the [[Tarkin family/Legends|Tarkin family]].\n\nDeppo continued his pursuits until he was sent off to engineering school and later served at an Imperial outpost on [[Nyasko]] before being assigned to work on one of the first World Devastators. Deppo enjoyed his work, ignoring the harm it might cause to others in the future, and in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]] was present at the [[Battle of Calamari]]. There, stolen control codes activated by the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] caused the World Devastators to become disabled and eventually crash into each other. Deppo escaped but was captured and detained by [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] authorities.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nDeppo was raised on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]], a factory world which served as [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin's]] seat of governorship over much of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. As a youth, Deppo enjoyed tinkering with [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] engines and riding along the various spires and smokestacks of his planet. He eventually fell in with a gang of joysmashers, stealing [[Speeder/Legends|speeders]] from the wealthy and driving recklessly around in them, before finally getting thrown out by his parents at the age of eleven. Left to fend for himself, Deppo made a living by stripping wrecks of all kinds and selling the parts to dealers or using them to repair vehicles which he would later resell.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\nThings were going well for Deppo until he was caught stealing a [[Speeder bike/Legends|hoverbike]] from the bodyguards of [[Rivoche Tarkin]], Wilhuff Tarkin's niece. Deppo was merely [[Stun/Legends|stunned]] by the guards, who seemed to him as less vicious than typical [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] guards, and, rather than face [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] in [[JuveCourt]], was given a job as a junior tech in Grand Moff Tarkin's motor pool. Here, Deppo finally found his true calling; he could tweak and tune all of the sophisticated military vehicles to his heart's content. Years of hard work finally paid off when the [[Tarkin family/Legends|Tarkins]] sponsored Deppo for engineering school on his twentieth birthday.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\n===Imperial service===\nAt the academy, Deppo trained for a position as a [[Starship/Legends|starship]] [[Engineer/Legends|engineer]]. With the skills he gained there and the high marks he received, Deppo could name his price in the private sector, but he wished only to work on the best machines, which in his mind were only made by the Empire. He eventually earned a post with an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]] [[Walker/Legends|walker]] battalion based on the backwater planet [[Nyasko]]. Since Nyasko was located in the [[Colunda sector]], which was known for having a strong [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] presence, Deppo constantly found himself busy repairing sabotaged and battle-damaged wrecks from the frequent clashes.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\nDeppo was later transferred to [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Comeg]]'s fleet in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]], where he was given the chance to work as a [[Calibration Engineer]] aboard a prototype Imperial [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]]&mdash;a [[World Devastator]]. Aboard the Devastator, named ''[[Silencer-7]]'', Deppo oversaw the automated factories which mass-produced attack craft from raw materials the Devastator gleaned from the surface of a planet. He, along with the [[Assembly Commander]], was responsible for maintaining the high rate of production put out from the factories during a battle.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\nIn [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]], a large group of World Devastators were [[Battle of Calamari|sent to]] the planet [[Dac|Mon Calamari]] as a part of the reborn [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Operation Shadow Hand|strategy for retaking the galaxy]]. ''Silencer-7'' led the attack against the planet and its [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] defenders until the [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] used stolen control codes given to him by the turncoat [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] to shut down the Devastators' [[Deflector shield/Legends|shields]] and defensive [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannons]].<ref name=\"Dark Empire\" /> As New Republic [[Sea Commando]]s and [[Calamari Defense Force]] troops boarded the stunted ''Silencer-7'' and began penetrating its factory levels, Deppo panicked and fled in an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] just as the Devastator crashed into the planet's surface. Deppo survived but found himself floating toward the very [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] city the Devastators had just attempted to siege. Eventually a New Republic [[Amphibion]] found him and he was forced to surrender. He was turned over to Mon Calamari authorities where he was incarcerated as a prisoner of war.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDeppo was an audacious youth and showed great mechanical proficiency at a young age, displaying little to no interest in anything outside of working on vehicles and vessels. He became very dedicated to his work as he grew older, so much so that he never recognized the amount of death and destruction his efforts would end up causing. Among the equipment he carried while working aboard World Devastators were a tech sealed suit, a [[Rebreather/Legends|breather unit]], a monofusion welder, various tools and clips and a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] linked to a Devastator's central [[Computer/Legends|computer]].<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDeppo was first introduced as a background character in the [[Dark Empire 6|final issue]] of the [[1991]]&ndash;[[1992]] [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series ''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]'' by [[Tom Veitch]]. It has been his only [[in-universe]] appearance in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]] thus far. Deppo's full backstory and fate was eventually revealed in the [[1993]] ''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'', written by [[Michael Allen Horne]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Dark Empire 6|''Dark Empire'' 6]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Deppo\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire science and engineering personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]"}}}]}}}}
