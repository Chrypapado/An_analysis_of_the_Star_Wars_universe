Not simply their battle tactics, but their history. Philosophy. Art.|Thrawn|Hera's Heroes}}\n'''Mitth'raw'nuruodo''', [[Reproduction|born]] as '''Kivu'raw'nuru''' with the [[core name]] '''Vurawn''', recognized in his early military career as '''Mitth'raw'nuru''', and better known by his core name '''Thrawn''', was a [[Chiss]] [[Gender|male]] [[officer]] of the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] and [[Grand Admiral]] in the [[Imperial Navy]] during the [[Imperial Era|age]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. An [[alien]] [[Imperial officer]] with striking [[Color|blue]] skin, red [[eye]]s, and an angular face, Thrawn was well known as a brilliant and ruthless strategist. He believed that in order to achieve victory in war, one must know their enemy. As such, he dedicated himself to understanding the philosophy, art, and culture of his opponents, which included the [[Twi'lek]]s of [[Ryloth]] and the [[Mandalorian|warriors]] of [[Mandalore]]. When [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] requested a strong [[commander]] capable of defeating [[Phoenix Cell|the rebels]] on [[Lothal]], Grand [[Admiral]] Thrawn accepted the challenge, intending to [[Lothal campaign|dismantle]] the rebellion one piece at a [[time]].\n\nBefore joining the [[Imperial Military]], Thrawn served with the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet|Expansionary Defense Fleet]] of the Chiss Ascendancy. A native of the [[planet]] [[Rentor]], located in the [[Unknown Regions]] of [[the galaxy]], Thrawn served the [[Chiss Defense Force]] with both valor and controversy. [[Patriarch]]s [[Mitth'oor'akiord]] \"Thooraki\" and [[Stybla'mi'ovodo]] \"Lamiov,\" leaders of the Chiss [[Mitth family|Mitth]] and [[Stybla family|Stybla]] [[Chiss family|families]] respectively, worked with [[General]] [[Ba'kif]], founder of the Expansionary Fleet, to [[Rematching|adopt]] Thrawn into the [[Mitth family]] and guide his career and training in the Fleet. Thooraki, Lamiov, and Ba'kif also worked together to guide Thrawn into a close friendship with [[Mitth'ras'safis]] \"Thrass,\" a Chiss man whose political talents complemented Thrawn's analytical and strategic skills in warfare. Thrawn, who did not form friendships easily, grew close to Thrass, and in time the two [[Failure at Pleknok|came to regard]] each other as brothers. Thrawn went on to lead [[Vagaari pirate operations|anti-piracy operations]] against a [[Vagaari pirates|group]] of [[pirate]]s known as the [[Vagaari]], which saw the tragic [[death]] of Thrawn's brother Thrass.\n\nNear the end of the [[Clone Wars]], the warlike [[Grysk Hegemony]] began a [[plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy]]. First, they groomed and trained a [[Nikardun]] general named [[Yiv]] who ruled the [[Nikardun Destiny]], an expansionist empire in the Unknown Regions. The Grysk agent [[Jixtus]] sent Yiv to [[Nikardun conquests|conquer or intimidate]] the [[Paataatus Hiveborn|nations]] [[Lioaoin Regime|neighboring]] the Ascendancy to [[Tower Dimension|encirle]] the Chiss, who [[Non-intervention policy|could not launch attacks]] on anyone who had not directly attacked the Ascendancy. Thrawn left his native Unknown Regions and traveled to known [[Realspace|space]] to search for allies against Yiv. There, he encountered the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] during the Clone Wars and fought alongside Skywalker during a [[Mission to Mokivj|mission]] to [[Mokivj]]. Shortly thereafter, Thrawn was instrumental in [[Battle over Primea|defeating]] [[Primea fleet|Yiv's fleet]], leading to the demise of the Nikardun Destiny. Following Yiv's defeat, Jixtus dispatched a group of the [[Telepathy|telepathic]] [[Agbui]] species to manipulate Chiss [[Xodlak'uvi'vil|officials]] into manipulate three of the Ascendancy's [[Great Families]] into starting a Chiss civil war. Thrawn was instrumental in [[Hoxim incident|diffusing the Agbui plot]] above the planet [[Hoxim]]. After the Agbui's failure to instigate a civil war in the Ascendancy, Jixtus enlisted the service of the [[Kilji Illumine]] to undermine the Ascendancy from within and [[Kilhorde conquests|close nations]] to the Southeast of the Ascendancy from Chiss refugees who would survive the war he hoped to foment. Aware of the [[Grysk armada]]'s superior firepower to the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, Thrawn and his friends arranged for [[Vak Combine|several]] [[Garwian Unity|allied]] [[Paccian Governance|nations]] to defeat [[Jixtus's fleet]] in a climactic battle over [[Sunrise]] known as [[Senior Captain Thrawn's last stand]].\n\nFollowing the [[Galactic Republic]]'s [[Proclamation of the New Order|reorganization]] into the Galactic Empire, Thrawn offered his allegiance to [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], having deemed an alliance with the [[New Order|new regime]] beneficial to his [[Species|people]]. With the help of [[Imperial cadet|Cadet]] [[Eli N. Vanto|Eli Vanto]], Thrawn assimilated into [[Galaxy|galactic]] society, becoming fluent in [[Galactic Basic Standard]] and ultimately graduating from the [[Royal Imperial Academy]] on [[Coruscant]]. His career in the [[Navy]] was highly successful; after a series of promotions, he received the [[Military rank|rank]] of Grand Admiral from the Emperor himself.\n\nAt the height of his career, Grand Admiral Thrawn served as [[commanding officer]] of the [[7th Fleet]], the [[flagship]] of which was the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Chimaera]]''. Deployed to the [[Lothal sector]] a few [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Action at Mustafar|start]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Thrawn sought to defeat the rebels led by [[Captain]] [[Hera Syndulla]]. During his leadership of the 7th Fleet, Thrawn proposed and staunchly advocated for a new [[starfighter]]-[[bomber]]: the [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|TIE Defender]], which was to be initially manufactured on Lothal before being mass-produced throughout the galaxy. Following the [[battle of Atollon]], the Emperor summoned Thrawn to his palace to undertake a mission with the Emperor's [[Sith apprentice]] [[Darth]] Vader, whom Thrawn once knew as the [[Jedi]] Anakin Skywalker. Palpatine considered Thrawn and Vader his two most useful servants and believed his [[Skirmish on Batuu|mission]] would require the unique talents and knowledge of both men. In the ensuing mission, Thrawn's [[fleet]] worked with Vader's [[First Legion]] and ultimately [[Battle of Mokivj|rescued]] several [[Force-sensitive]] Chiss [[Youngling|girls]] held captive by the warlike [[Grysk]] species. Soon thereafter, Thrawn took on a mission to defend the supply lines of [[Project Stardust]] from apparent losses to electronics-eating [[gralloc]]s. The true culprits of the losses were the treasonous Grand Admiral [[Balanhai Savit]] and, separately, a force of Grysks seeking to conquer Imperial space and perhaps control the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. After exposing Savit's treason and defeating that Grysk force, Thrawn resumed his task of eliminating Syndulla's rebel cell on Lothal. Syndulla's rebels confronted Thrawn's forces with the intention of [[Liberation of Lothal|liberating Lothal]] once and for all. During the battle, a flock of [[purrgil]] came to the aid of Jedi [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]] and inflicted heavy damage on the Seventh Fleet. Thrawn was on the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of his [[command ship]] when the creatures surrounded the ''Chimaera'' and pulled it into [[hyperspace]], taking both Thrawn and Bridger into the great unknown.\n\nIn the years following Thrawn's disappearance, the Emperor and Vader were killed at the [[Battle of Endor]], the Empire was decisively beaten at the [[Battle of Jakku]], and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] was [[Declaration of a New Republic|reorganized]] into the [[New Republic]]. In spite of Thrawn's vanishing years prior, former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]] was searching for Thrawn in [[9 ABY]], which led her to face Thrawn's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e [[Morgan Elsbeth]]. Even in his absence, Thrawn's talents benefited the New Order. His knowledge of the Unknown Regions proved essential to [[Imperial remnant (cold war)|Imperial remnants]] that retreated from the known galaxy, helping them survive in unexplored space where they eventually formed the [[First Order]], a major part of Emperor Palpatine's [[Contingency]] plan.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n<!-- Flashbacks and other pre-present information in ''Chaos Rising'' and ''Lesser Evil''. -->\n====Origins====\n{{Quote|I don't see any indication that his [Kivu] family has prepped him for military service.''\"<br />\"''No, they haven't.

This power, known as [[Precognition|''Third Sight'']], typically only manifested in young Chiss girls and disappeared by the time they matured.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\">''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]''</ref>\n\nIn school, Thrawn was taught the lie that the population of the Chiss [[homeworld]] and [[capital]] of [[Csilla]] was around 4 billion Chiss. Csilla had slowly frozen over [[5019 BBY|thousands]] of [[Standard year|years]] prior due to the decrease of the energy output of [[Csilla's star]], forcing its population to move entirely underground. In reality, the majority of the population had moved to other planets, with Csilla remaining mostly empty of citizens. (However, the remaining inhabitants of Csilla had in fact moved underground for the reason he was taught.) He eventually came to attend an academy on Rentor, where he attracted the attention of [[Mitth'oor'akiord]], the [[Patriarch]] of the [[Mitth family]] commonly known as Thooraki.\n\nThooraki pointed his friend [[Ba'kif|Labaki]], who rose to become a [[general]] under the name of Ba'kif, to take notice of Vurawn and point the [[Aristocra]] [[Mitth'urf'ianico]] \"Thurfian\" towards the student.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />  General Ba'kif had recently created the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet]]<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" /> when Thurfian visited Vurawn on Rentor. After Thurfian's visit, Vurawn was quickly accepted into the Mitth family as a [[merit adoptive]], and gained the new name Mitth'raw'nuru, thus making his core name \"Thrawn.\"<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> Thrawn's adoption to the Mitth occurred at some time after [[68 BBY]]<ref name=\"Adoption earliest\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]'' establishes that there were nine [[Nine Ruling Families|Ruling Families]] when Thrawn was initiated into the [[Mitth family]]. ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' takes place around [[18 BBY]] per the reasoning [[Template:GreaterGoodDate|here]]. In ''Greater Good'', [[Senior Captain]] [[Irizi'in'daro|Xodlak'in'daro]] reflected that the Xodlak had been removed from the Ten Ruling Families 50 years ago, leaving Nine Ruling Families and dating their removal to around [[68 BBY]]. Therefore, Thrawn became a merit adoptive of the Mitth some [[time]] after 68 [['ABY-BBY' dating system|BBY]].</ref> and by several years before [[21 BBY]].<ref name=\"Adoption latest\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]'' establishes that Thrawn spent two [[Standard year|years]] at the [[Taharim Academy]], and Thrawn's adoption into the Mitth occurred at the same time as his admission to the Academy. Thrawn had graduated from Taharim Academy and served as a [[Junior Commander]] by the time of his [[Mission to Bardram Scoft|mission]] to [[Bardram Scoft]] and the [[skirmish in the Kinoss system]], which took place several years prior to the main events of ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]''. ''Chais Rising'' is set in [[19 BBY]] per the reasoning [[Template:ChaosRisingDate|here]], and two years before that is [[21 BBY]]. Therefore, Thrawn's adoption into the Mitth must have occurred by several years before 21 [['ABY-BBY' dating system|BBY]].</ref>\n\n====Journey to Naporar====\n{{Quote|You're a cadet, and you're going to be in the Defense Force. I don't know what I'm going to do.''\"<br />\"''You're a ship captain's daughter. That will surely open many opportunities. But just because I know I'm going to the academy doesn't mean there aren't a great many unknowns.|Sky-walker Al'iastov and entering cadet Thrawn discuss their futures en route to the Taharim Academy on Naporar.|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nAfter his [[Rematching|recruitment]] into the Mitth family, Thrawn was transferred to the [[Taharim Academy]] on [[Naporar]], the planet from where much of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet was commanded rather than Csilla. Prior to his journey from Rentor to Naporar aboard the ''[[Tomra]]'', Thrawn had never flown in [[Realspace|space]]. Thrawn wanted to learn the map and the \"feel\" of the ship and ventured to a restricted area aboard the ''Tomra''{{'s}} [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]]. There, he met a sad 13-year old [[Youngling|girl]] named [[Mitth'ali'astov|Al'iastov]]. Unknown to Thrawn, Al'iastov was a sky-walker navigator nearing the expiration of her powers of [[The Force|Third Sight]]. The young girl was charged with navigating the ''Tomra'' to Naporar as a test of her retention of Third Sight, and required to tell any personnel not cleared to know of the existence of Chiss navigators that she was the captain's [[Parent|daughter]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nJourneys within the Ascendancy were often used to test aging sky-walkers because travel within the Ascendancy was much safer than travel within the Chaos at large, and if the navigator failed and steered their [[starship]] in the wrong direction, the [[helm officer]] could easily and safely correct their course. Al'iastov was distraught at her failure to navigate to Naporar, but Thrawn comforted the young girl, telling her that a captain's daughter would have many possible career paths. Thrawn inspired her so deeply that she sought to be rematched to his Mitth family after retiring from the [[Sky-walker corps]]. Years later, Al'iastov had become a merit adoptive of the Mitth now named Mitth'ali'astov \"Thalias\" and sought to travel with Thrawn just to see him again.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nJust as Thrawn cheered Al'iastov up on the ''Tomra'', [[Junior Captain]] [[Vorlip]] reached the [[transport]]'s bridge and admonished the new [[Chiss cadet]] for entering a restricted area. She tested Thrawn's instincts for the ''Tomra'' by blindfolding the young man, spinning him around so he would lose his balance, and then asking him to point in the direction of the ship's bow. Thrawn correctly identified the direction despite it being his first spaceflight, impressing Vorlip. She dismissed him, telling him to be certain he had clearance before entering restricted areas in the future. As he departed, Vorlip confided in Al'iastov that it took her over a dozen journeys in space to acquire such a sense of direction. Nevertheless, the Captain demerited Thrawn with 50 down-marks for accessing a restricted area. It would take [[Cadet]] Thrawn three [[Standard month|months]] to work off the demerits after arriving at the Academy.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n====Meeting Thrass on Avidich====\n{{Quote|How long are you staying on Avidich?''\"<br />\"''Just the one night. I was given special dispensation to come here, and I can't afford to be away any longer than necessary.''\"<br />\"''Sounds rather petty to me, coming all the way here only to turn around and hurry back.

But since I'm already working off fifty, I don't think&mdash;''\"<br />\"Fifty?'' What in the world did you do?|Aristocra Mitth'ras'safis \"Thrass\" and Cadet Thrawn at Thrawn's rematching dinner|Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil}}\nJust after being taken to the Taharim Academy on Naporar, Thrawn was taken to a [[rematching dinner]] at the [[Mitth family compound]] on [[Avidich]] for orientation. Unknown to those around him, Thrawn felt deep pain at the loss of his older sister Kivu'rik'ardok, whose [[starday]] it was and whom he believe had [[Death|died]] when he was three years old.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nThrawn was greeted by an Aristocra named [[Mitth'ras'safis]] \"Thrass\" who held the rank of [[Cousin]] within the Mitth family. Unbeknownst to either Thrawn or Thrass at the time, Patriarchs Thooraki of the Mitth and [[Stybla'mi'ovodo]] \"Lamiov\" of the [[Stybla family]] planned to unite Thrawn and Thrass in close friendship. They and Ba'kif, a Stybla known as Labaki until his promotion to flag rank, had seen Thrawn's great talents at combat and Thrass' political acumen; and wished to bring the two young men together to complement one-another. They believed the duo would bring the Mitth family to new heights and reinforce a millennia-old quiet friendship between the Mitth and Stybla families.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nMost merit adoptives adopted upon joining the Expansionary Defense Fleet attended their formal welcoming to the Mitth family on Avidich before going to Naporar. However, an exception had been made for Thrawn, leading Thrass to surmise that a high-ranking family official had wished for Thrawn to join the Fleet as quickly as possible. Thrawn impressed Thrass to the point of disbelief by identifying that several of the [[Mitth family artworks]] present in the compound were created by a female artist who had recently suffered a great personal loss in her family. Indeed, the works in question were produced by the historical Mitth Patriarch [[Mitth'omo'rossodo]] \"the Tragic,\" a woman all four of whose sons had died in battle at the [[Final Assault on Csilla]] not long before she painted her last artwork. Thrass could sense a deep personal loss in Thrawn's past, but could not discern what secrets lied behind the eyes of his new acquaintance.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nThrawn left Thrass to eat at the rematching dinner and perform the ceremony. Thrass continued to observe Thrawn through the rest of the rematching dinner, watching Thrawn draw back from social interactions, mainly speak when spoken to, and observe everything around him. Thrass decided to converse more with the young cadet Thrawn, who seemed uncomfortable. Understanding Thrawn's interest in art, Thrass offered to show the cadet the large collection of artwork available at the compound on Avidich. Aristocra Thrass asked Thrawn how long he would stay on Avidich, to which Thrawn replied that he had only been permitted to stay on Avidich for one night. Thrass sought to extend Thrawn's time on the planet, predicting that Thrawn would only recieve two or three downmarks for staying longer, and inisting that the Mitth family could have the downmarks waived. However, Thrawn informed Thrass that he had already accrued fifty downmarks, leading Thrass to question how Thrawn could have possibly earned so many demerits. Thrawn was surprised he had even been allowed to travel to Avidich at that time rather than waiting a few weeks, but Thrass pointed out the [[Politics|political]] concerns that had enabled Thrawn's presence that night: Avidich's [[Irizi family]] [[Unidentified Irizi Patriel|Patriel]] was present at the rematching dinner. The Irizi family was rivaled to the Mitth, and had a goal of dominating the [[Ascendancy military]] including Ba'kif's new Expansionary Defense Fleet. Mitth family Patriarch Thooraki wished to show off three military rematches to the Irizi rather than two, and had thus appealed to [[Colonel]] [[Wevary]], Taharim Academy's leader, to allow Thrawn a one-day travel pass to Avidich. Understanding that Thrawn had to return to Naporar soon, Thrass offered to show Thrawn the [[Patriel]]'s art collection, and described the art gallery at the [[Mitth family homestead]] on Csilla as even grander. Thrawn declined Thrass' offer, but said he'd like to examine art with the Aristocra some day.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\n====Cadet at Taharim Academy====\nAs a student at Taharim Academy, Thrawn consistently scored among the top of his class. Eventually, Thrawn was [[Mitth'raw'nuru's cheating charge|accused of cheating]] on a combat simulation exam proctored by Senior Cadet [[Ar'alani|Irizi'ar'alani]] \"Ziara,\"<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> who was three years older than him.<ref name=\"Greater Good\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''</ref> Thrawn scored much higher on that exam than anyone in the history of Taharim Academy, leading to the allegations. In reality, Thrawn was innocent, having invented a [[Unidentified maneuver|stealth maneuver]] during the simulation which led to his exceptional score. However, the simulation could not be repeated with the same parameters, so Thrawn could not establish his innocence. Resigned to a fate of expulsion from the Academy, Thrawn was given a chance by Ziara, who called in General Ba'kif to intervene on Thrawn's behalf. Ba'kif proposed that, if Thrawn could not establish his innocence through a simulation, a combat exercise with the same parameters should suffice. Indeed, Thrawn successfully executed his evasive maneuver in the ensuing exercise, establishing his innocence and displaying his strategic talents.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn invited Ziara to a night out to celebrate his acquittal. She expected music and [[alcohol]], but Thrawn took her to an [[Unidentified art gallery|art gallery]] to analyze alien art and learn their military tactics. Thrawn took the opportunity to tutor Ziara in analyzing art for tactical information. Eventually, Ziara insisted she was a practical person and invited him to her quarters to examine her sculptures. Thereafter, she challenged him to defeat her in combat with [[soft-coat stick]]s based on what he could glean from her art. Indeed, he defeated her in the sparring match at a [[Unidentified dojo (Naporar)|dojo]], impressing her. Thrawn caused Ziara to blush when he correctly inferred that she had too much honor to play \"dirty tricks\" on an opponent and told her his inference.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n===As a junior officer===\n====Young Lieutenant Thrawn====\n{{Quote|I want to hear more about this Junior Commander Ziara who single-handedly saved your career.''\"<br />\"''It wasn't ''quite'' like that.''\"<br />\"''Then tell me exactly how it was.

Really, the only thing that will change about the story is how smug I let myself sound when I tell it.|Having recognized his friendship with Thrawn, Thrass proceeded to ask the recently-graduated lieutenant how Ziara had saved his career.|Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil}}\nTwo years after being rematched into the Mitth family, Thrawn graduated from Taharim Academy with a [[lieutenant]]'s commission in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet. Aristocra Thrass had kept tabs on Thrawn's progress as a Taharim Academy cadet, but had not seen him since their rematching dinner. However, Patriarch Thooraki summoned Thrass to [[Office of the Patriarch|his office]] to travel to Naporar and convince Thrawn to remain with the Mitth instead of joining the Stybla family as a [[Trial-born]], which would be a promotion from his current rank as a Mitth family merit adoptive. At the time, Thrass was surprised to be called before the Patriarch for such a seemingly trivial task. However, Patriarchs Thooraki and Lamiov secretly arranged for a scenario where Thrass would have to declare his friendship with Thrawn or Thrawn would be offered rematching as a Stybla Trial-born.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nThrass traveled from Csilla to Naporar, where he arranged to meet Thrawn for lunch at a [[Unidentified bistro|bistro]]. Thrass arrived ten minutes before Thrawn. Eight minutes after Thrass sat down, a strange man showed up uninvited and sat across from Thrass. The strange Chiss surprised Thrass by knowing his name. When asked, the stranger introduced himself as [[Stybla'ppin'cykok]] \"Lappincyk,\" [[Senior Aide]] to Stybla Patriarch Lamiov, and impressed Thrass with his knowledge of the successes and workings of the Mitth family. Lappincyk informed Thrass that he would be extending Thrawn an offer of rematching to the Stybla and challenged Thrass to outperform that offer. Having been tasked by Patriarch Thooraki with retaining Thrawn as a Mitth, Thrass insisted that the Stybla merely saw Thrawn as a shiny new piece in a game of family glory and politics. Lappincyk riposted by questioning whether the Mitth saw more than that in Thrawn. Thrass retorted that he did not know what the Mitth family saw in Thrawn, but declared that he saw Thrawn as his friend, in the process admitting it to himself. Lappincyk remarked that Thrass' pronouncment of Thrawn as his friend was interesting.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nJust after Thrass declared his friendship with Thrawn, the young lieutenant arrived and sat down. Just as Thrawn had predicted, he joined Thrass precisely ten minutes after the Aristocra. Thrawn thanked Thrass for working around his schedule as a lieutenant in the Expansionary Defense Fleet, before declaring to Lappincyk that he did not believe they had met before. Lappincyk introduced himself to Thrawn, and Thrass expected the Senior Aide to follow up with the an offer of rematching as a merit adoptive of the Stybla. To Thrass' surprise, the Stybla official instead told the lieutenant that he was just leaving, and bade the two friends to enjoy their meal. Unbeknownst to either Thrass or Thrawn at the time, the encounter between Thrass and Lappincyk had been a test concocted by Patriarchs Lamiov and Thooraki to see whether Thrass would admit his friendship with Thrawn. The Patriarchs had been coordinating to bring Thrass and Thrawn together as close friends, seeing the young men as possessing a powerful combination of political, military, tactical, and strategic skills which could elevate the Mitth to new heights. If Thrass had not declared his friendship with Thrawn, the Stybla would indeed have extended their rematching offer to Thrawn.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nUnaware of the Patriarchs' plot to unite the two Mitth in close friendship, Thrass was perplexed by Senior Aide Lappincyk's behavior. However, Thrass considered the depth of politicking which Lappincyk had been conducting beyond his position or skill at the time. Thrass relented, deciding to merely enjoy lunch with his friend Thrawn. The Aristocra asked the lieutenant to tell him all about Ziara, by then a Junior Commander, having heard that Ziara single-handedly saved Thrawn's career during his allegations of cheating at Taharim Academy. Thrawn demurred, protesting mildly that that was not quite how the events unraveled, leading Thrass to ask his friend for the exact specifics. Thrass told Thrawn he would retell the story later as a means of proving that the Mitth was the finest of the Ascendancy's Ruling Families, and he wished to have all the details correct. Thrawn noted the bias of Thrass' conclusion, asking what if the details did not support the Aristocra's goal of demonstrating the supreme fineness of the Mitth. Thrass dismissed Thrawn's hypothetical stipulation, insisting the details would indeed support his goal.

If I can't make a clear distinction, I'll take no action.|Junior Commander Thrawn and General Ba'kif|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nAs a [[Chiss officer]], Thrawn rose through the ranks to become a well-respected member of the Ascendancy to many of his colleagues. However, he faced opposition from and was disliked by other colleagues in the military and some politicians as well. He would continue to receive briefings for the Expansionary Defense Fleet at its [[Expansionary Fleet complex|complex]] on Naporar.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n[[File:Greater-Good-BN-Edition-cropped.png|thumb|right|265px|Thrawn was a highly skilled yet controversial officer in the Chiss Defense Force.]]\nIn order to keep their own Force-sensitive sky-walker corps a secret from the rest of the Unknown Regions, the Chiss also hired the services of [[Pathfinders (Navigators' Guild)|Pathfinder navigators]] from the [[Navigators' Guild]]. During Thrawn's service as a [[Junior Commander]] serving as a [[pilot]] aboard a [[Chiss diplomatic cruiser]], the Chiss had been faced with [[pirate]]s attacking their shipping [[freighter]]s in the outer reaches of their territory, off [[Pesfavri]] and [[Schesa]], for several months. Concurrently, the diplomatic ship was [[Mission to Bardram Scoft|tasked with heading]] to the planet [[Bardram Scoft]] to meet the new [[Prefect (Scoftic government)|Prefect]] of the [[Scoftic government]], given that their [[Unidentified Prefect|previous Prefect]] had been [[assassin]]ated. To reach Bardram Scoft, the ship stopped at [[Guild Concourse 447]], where they hired Pathfinder [[Qilori|Qilori of Uandualon]] to lead them through [[hyperspace]]. Thanks to Qilori, the ship arrived at Bardram Scoft several [[Standard minute|minutes]] ahead of the captain's schedule.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nOnce they arrived at the planet, Qilori came out of his navigational trance, and he and Thrawn were the only people present on the bridge. When asked where the rest of the crew was, Thrawn explained the [[ambassador]] was being prepared and that, in line with [[Scofti]] culture, the highest-ranking military [[officer]] needed to join them. He also explained that their ambassador would need to learn the protocols of the new Prefect, explaining that the previous holder of the title had been assassinated. Calmly informing Qilori that such actions were not uncommon in Scofti culture, Thrawn noticed a ship out the [[viewport]] belonging to another nation. When Qilori guessed it to be a [[Lioaoi]]n ship, Thrawn explained it resembled the pirate crafts that had been attacking Chiss shipping freighters. Although Qilori had heard rumors that the [[Lioaoin Regime]] had turned to piracy to save its economy, the Guild's rules about neutrality prevented him from informing Thrawn. The Junior Commander instead suggested the pirates could have bought their starships from a local manufacturer also used by the Regime.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter Qilori confirmed he had traveled to [[Lioaoin space]] before, Thrawn asked him if he could travel there from Chiss space or elsewhere, such as from Bardram Scoft. Qilori said he could, and asked Thrawn if he wanted to travel to Lioaoin space at present. Thrawn confirmed they were not presently heading into Lioaoin space, learned Qilori's name, and learned that he was mostly based at Concourse 447. The Junior Commander then proposed that they could work together again in the future and introduced himself as Thrawn, stating he would specifically seek out Qilori's service. The Pathfinder rued the idea but lied to Thrawn by saying the prospect sounded wonderful. Unbeknownst to the Pathfinder, Thrawn had correctly become convinced the pirates were connected to the Lioaoin Regime. Furthermore, the Junior Commander also inferred that Qilori suspected or knew that too, because a secret of such gravity would be hard to keep from the Navigators' Guild.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter meeting Qilori, Thrawn researched the Pathfinders and uncovered a deeply held secret: that they could track each-other through hyperspace. Armed with this knowledge, he proposed a [[Skirmish in the Kinoss system|response]] to the pirate attacks to General Ba'kif. During their meeting, Thrawn argued that the pirate and Lioaoin ships had notable similarities, but he suggested they attack the pirates alone instead of assaulting the Lioaoin Regime. Ba'kif reminded Thrawn of the Ascendancy's strict [[preemptive-strike laws]], which forbade military action against anyone except forces known to have previously attacked the Chiss. Despite believing he would be able to distinguish enemy and neutral ships, Thrawn nevertheless promised he would take no action if he could not make such a distinction. Ba'kif feared Thrawn may be overconfident and that such self-certainty could backfire. Nevertheless, the general understood that continued pirate attacks made the Ascendancy look weak to other nations of the Chaos, so he approved the Junior Commander's request for three ships, in part as a deterrent.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====The Skirmish at Kinoss=====\n{{Quotetrans|If they suspect you're hunting pirates\u2014''\u00bb<br />\u00ab''You think they only suspect? Yes; point taken. Let's remove any lingering doubts.|Navigator Qilori and Junior Commander Thrawn|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nOnce his mission was approved, Thrawn hired Qilori and traveled to the [[Lioaoin heartworld]] aboard a freighter with the Pathfinder. Unknown to Qilori, another Chiss ship arrived as well, which was also guided by a member of the Navigators' Guild. Upon seeing Lioaoin patrol ships, Thrawn was confident their design was similar enough to the pirate craft to confirm his theory, though Qilori did not see the connection. Though their freighter was already too deep in the heartworld's gravity well to escape through hyperspace, Thrawn piloted the ship even further in to get a closer look. Such a path took their freighter closer to two patrol ships stationed at a repair center. Thrawn believed the ship in the repair center had recently raided the [[Massoss system]]. Qilori protested, citing the potential outbreak of danger if the Regime was involved with the pirates, though his comment only served to make Thrawn question if he knew for certain that they were. After he denied knowing anything, Qilori again asked to leave, as he knew Pathfinders on the [[Lioaoin corsair]]s could track him through hyperspace. Instead, Thrawn decided to remove any doubt among their foes that they were pursuing pirates. To the horror of Qilori, the Junior Commander sent out a transmission in a [[trade language]] known to the Lioaoi, confirming that he had found the pirates and ordering the second Chiss ship to flee.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter revealing the existence of the second craft to Qilori, Thrawn began to pilot their ship away with its [[Engine|thrusters]] on full. Thrawn slipped past a potential trap and ordered Qilori to take them to the [[Kinoss system]], where couriers could take their report to Naporar and Csilla. Qilori worried greatly that the Pathfinders aboard the Lioaoin craft could still track him through hyperspace, believing both fleeing Chiss vessels would be destroyed. However, such pursuit was exactly what Thrawn hoped for, as he believed the Lioaoin pirates used Pathfinders as well and had set a trap for their pursuers. During their journey, Qilori received visions of the pursuing ships, forcing him to revert to realspace on two occasions to regain his connection to the Force. During those pauses, the Junior Commander remained silent. Shortly after they had arrived in the Kinoss system, four Lioaoin corsairs emerged from hyperspace, fulfilling Thrawn's plan. Thrawn then revealed his knowledge of Pathfinders' ability to track each other through hyperspace, which Qilori denied. Unconvinced by the navigator's lie, Thrawn explained that the Pathfinders' \"style\" had been a part of the latest pirate attack, and that he hoped to bait those pirates at the heartworld before their hired Pathfinders returned to their base stations. Shortly thereafter, the four enemy ships were confronted by a [[cruiser]] under the command of Thrawn's colleague [[Mid Captain]] Ziara. Ziara suggested Thrawn and Qilori continue on their present path so they could have the best possible view of the pirates' ensuing destruction. That skirmish would come to mark the start of the Ascendancy's [[Lioaoin pirate campaign]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n====As a Senior Commander====\n=====The Stivic incident=====\n{{Quote|I can see it all. Their tactics, their patterns, their weaknesses. I could tell you right here, right now, how to beat them.|Senior Commander Thrawn to Senior Captain Ziara|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nFollowing the skirmish in the Kinoss system, General Ba'kif promoted Thrawn two ranks, from Junior Commander to [[Senior Commander]]. The general also promoted Ziara to [[Senior Captain]] for her involvement. The year following the skirmish at Kinoss, Senior Commander Thrawn served aboard the [[Chiss patrol cruiser|patrol cruiser]] ''[[Parala]]'' commanded by Senior Captain Ziara. The ''Parala'' received a [[Distress signal|distress call]] from [[Security officer]] [[Frangelic]] on the [[Garwian]] colony world of [[Stivic]], a trade hub for the local [[species]] of the Unknown Regions. Stivic and its [[Unidentified orbiting merchant-hub station|orbital merchant-hub]] were under attack by Lioaoin pirates, just as the pirates had attacked the Chiss. The ''Parala''{{'s}} Mid Captain [[Clarr'os'culry|Roscu]] acted indifferently, though she mused that the merchant-hub had been home to good caf\u00e9s which she would regret to see destroyed. Thrawn implored Ar'alani to bring the ''Parala'' to bear to aid in the Garwians' defense. The Captain was tempted to do so, but understood that such intervention would be a violation of the Ascendancy's non-aggression laws and mean the end of her career.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThe Expansionary Defense Fleet was, however, permitted to provide humanitarian aid to other nations. Moreover, part of its mandate upon creation was to assess threats to the Ascendancy beyond its borders. Ziara commanded her bridge crew to bring them out of hyperspace to observe the [[Stivic incident|skirmish underway]] at Stivic, justifying the excursion on the grounds that these were the same Lioaoin pirates whom she had engaged at Kinoss the previous year. By that reasoning, observing the pirate raid would be a form of threat assessment and well within the Expansionary Fleet's purview.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nSenior Commander Thrawn recognized the weaknesses and tactical blindspots of the attacking Lioaoin corsairs in a deep manner which few others could replicate or even understand. He insisted that he could tell Ar'alani how to defeat the Lioaoi with no damage sustained to the ''Parala''. The Captain steadfastly refused to engage the attackers, but permitted Thrawn to \"calibrate\" the ''Parala''{{'s}} ranging lasers. There, Thrawn sent the local Garwians a message encoded in [[modulated laserfire]] detailing the weaknesses of the attacking Lioaoin ships. The ''Parala''{{'s}} officers witnessed the battle's tide turn, and only Ziara knew that Thrawn was behind the Garwians' upset victory. Nevertheless, Ziara told her [[Executive officer|first officer]] Roscu that she should feel relieved, as the caf\u00e9s aboard the merchant-hub station had been saved.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Rescuing a luxury liner=====\n{{Quote|Thank you for your assistance, Senior Captain Ziara. Without you, the liner would indeed have been lost.''\"<br />\"''Thank you in turn for your quick thinking. A word of warning, though. If I were you, I wouldn't expect a lot of thanks from anyone else.|Thrawn and Ziara|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nSometime following the Stivic incident, Thrawn was given his first command: the [[patrol ship]] ''[[Boco]]''. Eventually, the ''Boco'' answered a distress call from an [[Unidentified excursion liner|excursion liner]] owned by the Chiss [[Boadil family]]. The craft, which had eight-thousand people aboard, had begun crashing into the upper [[atmosphere]] of a triple-ringed [[Unidentified triple-ringed gas giant|gas giant planet]]. Notably, the imperiled craft had luxury suites for its wealthiest passengers on its port and starboard wings. The liner had descended too far into the planet's magnetic bands and radiation for the passengers and crew to be able use the vessel's [[escape pod]]s, and the ship's thrusters had failed as well. Despite the major difference in mass, Thrawn's patrol ship activated its [[tractor beam]]s to try to pull the liner out, creating a smaller wake several hundred meters in front of the liner as the ''Boco'' strained and failed to stabilize the Boadil-owned ship. Thrawn sent an emergency message to Ziara. Although Ziara's journey through hyperspace took two hours and communication was impossible whilst in hyperspace, the ''Parala'' arrived in time for Thrawn to contact Ziara and ask her to join the ''Boco'' off the falling ship's bow.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAlthough she gave the order to her helm, Ziara informed Thrawn that the combined power of both their ships would not be enough to overcome the planet's gravity and rescue the liner. Thrawn updated her on the status of the derelict ship, informing his colleague that all the people aboard the doomed ship were gathered in the central cylinder behind still-functioning shielding, that no other aid was coming, and that they had little time to act. Once the ''Parala'' was parallel to the ''Boco'' and had activated its tractor beams, Thrawn ordered his ship to drop its tractor beams and move towards the liner. The ''Boco'' fired its [[spectrum laser]]s upon the liner's portside and starboard wings, lightening its mass. Some of Ziara's officers bristled in the belief that Thrawn was attacking the liner they were charged with rescuing. Ziara, however, understood Thrawn's plan as it unfolded. As soon as the ''Boco'' shot the liner's starboard wing off, Ziara orcered her ''Parala'' to use emergency power to strengthen its tractor beam. As the suddenly lighter liner finally started to be pulled free from the planet thanks to the ''Parala''{{'s}} tractor beam, the ''Boco'' returned to the side of Ziara's ship, reactivating its tractor beam and thrusters to help. Over the course of fifteen minutes, the liner was pulled out of the planet's atmosphere and gravity well, into safety. With all eight-thousand people aboard safe, Thrawn contacted Ziara to thank her, and Ziara returned the favor by thanking his quick thinking. However, the Senior Captain made sure to warn the Commander that, with the fancy suites of the wings destroyed in the atmosphere, he would soon encounter opposition, as the wealthier passengers had likely lost many of their expensive possessions in the rescue.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====The truth of Csilla=====\n{{Quote|What's happened to our capital, Ziara?|Thrawn, to Ziara|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\n[[File:Csilla_WITGATWOTFA.jpg|thumb|left|230px|For the first time in his life, Thrawn arrived on Csilla after working with Ziara to save a star liner.]]\nHaving committed a controversial act that was not in the military's purview, as it mainly involved civilian affairs, Thrawn was summoned to a high-level hearing on Csilla. The Senior Commander was accompanied by Ziara, to whom he admitted that he had never been to their species' homeworld as their [[shuttle]] descended. Ziara attempted to ease his worries, noting that he held a political advantage because passengers they had saved included Aristocra from at least five [[Nine Ruling Families|Ruling Families]] apart from the Boadil. Even so, Thrawn admitted his hopes that his hearing would not become so politicized. As they descended to Csilla's icy surface, Thrawn asked if the [[city]] they were approaching was [[Csaplar]], the capital city of the Ascendancy. The Senior Captain confirmed it was, declaring that Csaplar had once been a center of culture. Thrawn was unaware that Csaplar and Csilla had become sparsely populated and stated in confusion that a city with a population of seven million should certainly be able to support both the arts and the Ascendancy's government. Unbeknownst to Senior Commander Thrawn, the official population figure of seven million was vastly inflated. Ziara promised herself that she would tell Thrawn the truth about Csilla once out of earshot of others. Upon arrival to Csaplar's southwestern [[Csaplar spaceport|spaceport]], Ziara and Thrawn took a tunnel car to the [[Fleet headquarters]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn's hearing proved brief and perfunctory. The Boadil representative demanded Thrawn be punished and possibly even removed from the Fleet. However, representatives of three families whose members Thrawn had saved were also present; arguing that Thrawn should be commended and promoted. The claims and counterclaims of the Aristocra balanced out, leaving Thrawn nearly where he started without a promotion or demotion. There was one critical exception, however: Thrawn was removed from the command of the ''Boco''. Ziara believed this to be due to some obscure political favor someone present owed someone else. The loss of his first command disappointed Thrawn, although he tried to hide it. Ziara was surprised and apologized to her friend for the Fleet's decision as they traveled back to Csaplar aboard a tunnel car. Thrawn rationalized the tribunal's decision on the grounds that his actions had cost the Boadil millions. Ziara countered his rationale, noting that the liner's [[Unidentified liner captain|captain]] was responsible for the crisis. Even so, she understood that Thrawn had been blamed because the captain was a member of the [[Ufsa family]], which was a political ally of the Boadil. As their discussion continued, Ziara informed her friend that she had requested he become one of her officers aboard the ''Parala'', which would also give him the convenient passage off Csilla he would need with the ''Boco'' no longer under his command. Instead of having Thrawn wait in a [[hotel]] during his time on Csilla, she offered him lodging with her at the [[Irizi family homestead]]. Although Thrawn was concerned that guests may not be permitted into to her family's [[homestead]], particularly because the Mitth was a rival with Ziara's Irizi family, she convinced him to come by revealing that her grandfather had been a passionate art collector. Thrawn accepted her offer but commented that Ziara was skilled at exploiting her opponents' weaknesses; in this case, his appreciation for art.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nUnsatisfied by the Syndicure and the Fleet's treatment of her friend, Ziara resolved to teach Thrawn Csilla's true history; far more than regulations permitted an officer of his [[military rank|rank]] to know. Ziara secured the two of them a two-person [[tube car]] that went across Csaplar rather than through the tunnels under the city, which was highly unusual. Senior Captain Ziara felt angry and somewhat rebellious from the hearing's outcome and wanted to see how long it would take Thrawn to realize something was amiss about the Chiss capital city and planet. As the two rode in the car, the Senior Commander looked out the viewport, quickly seeing a contradiction between what he had learned about Csaplar in school and the city's stark reality. Thrawn noticed a lack of people and occupied cars as they traveled.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn became vocally distressed when the pair were slightly over a third of the way through Csaplar to Ziara's family homestead. Ziara apologized for showing him the truth and then revealed that the entire planet had undergone an exodus [[Millennium|thousands of years]] prior. The energy output by [[Csilla's star]] had decreased millennia ago, causing the planet's surface to freeze and leading to a mass exodus of Chiss to other worlds of the Ascendancy. At any time, only several hundred Chiss stayed aboveground in Csaplar while automated lights, vehicles, and traffic provided an illusion of a thriving capital. Ziara informed the man that, despite the Ascendancy listing Csilla's official population as eight billion people, the true population of their homeworld was closer to sixty or seventy million. Nearly all of those people lived underground, where the true cities lied. Ziara explained that her family's homestead was in an underground cavern beneath the ancestral Irizi lands. Thrawn quickly understood the tactical purpose of the deception: an enemy who sought to attack the Chiss Ascendancy would waste time attacking an effectively empty planet advertised to the Chaos as a thriving center of culture and commerce. However, the Senior Commander also realized that such detailed knowledge of Csilla must surely be disallowed for an officer of rank as low as his. He asked the Senior Captain why she chose to disclose the truth of Csilla to him, to which she replied that she knew he thrived on information. Furthermore, she firmly believed he would be promoted in the near future, at which time he would be given a top-level briefing on the subject. She advised Thrawn to \"act surprised\" in that briefing. Thrawn then asked Ziara if she had told the Irizi about his stay in their homestead. She revealed that she had not, but insisted it would not cause trouble. The male Chiss protested that she only assumed so, which she conceded.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Politics, promotions, and pressures=====\n{{Quote|You've made quite a name for yourself over the past few years.''\"<br />\"''Sometimes that name is appended to a curse.|Aristocra Zistalmu and Senior Commander Thrawn|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\n[[File:Chaos-Rising-OOP-Art.png|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn was frequently the center of political pressure for the Mitth family.]]\nA few weeks after his stay at the Irizi homestead, Thrawn was summoned to the office of Aristocra [[Irizi'stal'mustro]] \"Zistalmu\". Thrawn knocked on the door at precisely the specified time and was welcomed in by a reluctant Zistalmu, though the Aristocra acted friendly. Zistalmu acknowledged that the Commander had made \"quite a name\" for himself over the past few years, to which Thrawn replied by acknowledging his controversial status among the Ascendancy. The Irizi official informed Thrawn of supposed problems the Commander had with certain critics within his Mitth family, and told the officer that even if the Mitth did not recognize his dedication, the Irizi family certainly did.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn did not understand that this was meant as setup for an offer of recruitment into the Irizi family. He thanked Zistalmu but informed the older man that he did not see how that would help his position because of the rivalry between the Mitth and Irizi families. Zistalmu said the Irizi had in mind a \"more direct\" means of helping Thrawn, which Thrawn still did not see as a preface to an offer of rematching. The Aristocra proceeded to unofficially offer Thrawn a spot as a Trial-born of the Irizi, a promotion from his current rank as a Mitth family merit adoptive. Zistalmu assured Thrawn that if he accepted, he would never have to perform the [[Trials]] because the Irizi family had deemed his \"exemplary service\" in the Defense Fleet an adequate substitute. Furthermore, the momentum of joining a [[Chiss family]] as a Trial-born would accelerate a Chiss' path toward promotion to [[ranking distant]] or even higher.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn reacted with shock, telling Zistalmu that he was honored and humbled but did not see how his detachment from the Mitth would benefit the Irizi family. The official told Thrawn the Irizi could always use another distinguished military officer of high rank and they believed Thrawn was the best choice. Thrawn said he would need time to consider the offer. As the Senior Commander departed, he turned to the Aristocra and remarked that the Irizi already had one such officer, Senior Captain Ziara. Zistalmu replied that she would not be Irizi for much longer.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nShortly thereafter, Senior Captain Irizi'ar'alani was promoted to the [[Flag officer|flag rank]] of [[Commodore]], removing her membership of the Irizi family and rendering her as simply Ar'alani. At the party celebrating her promotion, Thrawn told his superior officer that he \"required\" advice. He asked Ar'alani's thoughts on whether he should join the Irizi family. The Commodore informed her subordinate that the Irizi had long dominated the military, and she had never been comfortable with it. Thrawn asked whether the Irizi family's military-mindedness would not suit him better than the Mitth, but she ultimately told him he would have to decide for himself. He thanked her for saving him on multiple occasions, including her testimonies in both the Stivic incident and his charge of cheating at Taharim Academy. She asked Thrawn to explain how he had empowered the Garwians' defense of Stivic, which he explained to her. She remarked that the [[Garwian Unity]] stated on record that the credit belonged to Frangelic, and that the man had probably been promoted, which both agreed the Garwian well deserved. Ar'alani told Thrawn that she had requested the Defense Hierarchy Council make him her first officer. She then touched Thrawn on the arm and invited him to buy her a celebratory drink somewhere more \"quiet,\" where he could tell her more of his goals that the Ascendancy would pretend not to be grateful for.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====The Solitair affair=====\n{{Quotetrans|I see two additional weaknesses. But Commodore Ar'alani is right. This is something the Ascendancy must stand back from.''\u00bb<br />\u00ab''You helped us once. Is not the situation here even more dire?|Senior Commander Thrawn and Security Chief Frangelic|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nSome time following Ar'alani's promotion to commodore, the Garwian Unity invited her and Thrawn to their capital planet of [[Solitair]], ostensibly to thank the two Chiss for their assistance at the Stivic incident. In fact, they hoped to manipulate the Chiss into revealing more of the Lioaoi's tactical weaknesses for a planned campaign of conquest in Lioaoin space. The Lioaoin Regime sent two diplomatic ships to Solitair to negotiate a surrender to the Garwians.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nPrior to the Lioaoin diplomatic vessels' arrival at Solitair, Thrawn and Ar'alani were treated as honored guests and immersed in Garwian culture. The Garwians prided themselves on artisanship, having thousands of [[Creators' Market]]s across the Unity that showcased fine, hand-crafted [[clothing]], artwork, food, and more. After exploring their hosts' culture, Ar'alani confessed to Thrawn that she had begun to see non-Chiss as people, a view she had never held before. The Commodore believed Thrawn had always recognized non-Chiss individuals' personhood and considered it a strength of his. However, Thrawn coldly replied that he saw non-Chiss as assets first and foremost and people second.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nOnce the Lioaoin diplomatic ships neared the planet, Thrawn and Ar'alani's hosts pretended to be under attack by those diplomats, begging Thrawn to coordinate a [[Skirmish above Solitair|counterattack]] for the Garwian forces. Ar'alani intervened in time to prevent Thrawn from unwittingly aiding the Garwians' aggression, but not before Thrawn revealed some tactical information useful against the Lioaoi. The Garwians attacked the diplomatic ships, which began broadcasting surrender and distress signals. Both Chiss officers were angry for being manipulated into bending their non-aggression laws. Before Ar'alani and Thrawn left Solitair, they threatened their hosts and warned them never to cross the Chiss Ascendancy again.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n====Demotion to Mid Commander====\n{{Quote|A Trial-born.

As a result, they demoted Thrawn from Senior Commander to Mid Commander. After leaving Solitair and nearly reaching the Ascendancy, Ar'alani called the Commander into her office to discuss the events that transpired. Thrawn apologized for nearly breaking the Ascendancy's non-aggression laws, saying that he should have seen how the Garwians hoped to manipulate their Chiss guests. Ar'alani rebuffed his acceptance of blame, protesting that ''she'' should have recognized their hosts' manipulative schemes, but not ''he''. Thrawn asked whether this was due to her being more experienced than him, but she replied by commenting on his political ineptitude. She said he did not understand politics, ledger-balancing, or jockeying for positions and prestige. Thrawn protested that politics was another form of warfare and asked his friend if it was possible to learn this power. Ar'alani responded that it would be helpful for Thrawn to do so, but added to herself that he never would, as he was \"tone-deaf\" to the nuances and self-serving \"dances\" of politics.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nIn spite of Thrawn's demotion, the Defense Hierarchy Council assigned Thrawn a new command: the [[Chiss heavy cruiser]] ''Springhawk''. They considered assigning Thrawn to [[Picket Force Two]] and stationing the man and his command ship on the Ascendancy's Eastern zenith border, on the far side of Chiss territory from both the Garwians and Lioaoi. The Irizi family, which had previously offered Thrawn a spot as an Irizi Trial-born, now offered him to join the family at the even higher rank of ranking distant. In response, Thrawn's own Mitth family decided to offer him Trial-born status without having to perform the Trials, hoping that he would prefer to be a Trial-born of the Mitth over a ranking distant of the Irizi. Aristocra Thurfian was outraged upon hearing that Thrawn would be, in his opinion, essentially rewarded for such a brazen, illegal, reckless, and politically fraught act. However, [[Speaker (Chiss Ascendancy)|Speaker]] [[Thistrian]] insisted that it was better for the family to hold onto Thrawn in case he should bring them glory. Thurfian protested, believing the Irizi were bluffing to draw Thrawn closer to the Mitth, where he would create more fallout for the Mitth if and when he embarrassed or disgraced himself. Thurfian saw that such rewards in the face of a disgraceful event required someone high-up in both the military and the Mitth family to spend serious political capital to defend Thrawn, and asked Thistrian who Thrawn's benefactors might be. Thistrian reasoned that on the Fleet side, Thrawn's sponsor must either be General Ba'kif or possibly Admiral [[Ja'fosk]]. Thistrian was neither willing to conclude nor dismiss that Thrawn's high-ranking Mitth ally was Patriarch Thooraki himself.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n====The Vagaari pirate operations====\n{{Quote|That [the Vagaari pirate operations] was certainly one of his [Thrawn's] most mixed-result exploits.

The operations were a military success, with the threat of [[Vagaari pirates]] eliminated. Moreover, Thrawn had acquired a [[gravity well projector]] from a [[Unidentified Lesser Space starship|mysterious starship]] from Lesser Space; valuable technology that the Ascendancy's scientists were still trying to reverse-engineer<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> around [[18 BBY]].<ref name=\"Greater Good date\">{{GreaterGoodDate}}</ref> However, the Vagaari pirate operations were considered politically disastrous<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> and one of Thrawn's most \"mixed-result\" exploits.

The two left to look into an [[Attack on the edge of the Dioya system|attack]] on the edge of the Ascendancy's outer [[Dioya system]]. Thrawn and Ba'kif ventured to the [[Dioya]] system, where unknown assailants had attacked a ship full of [[refugee]]s of unknown origin, slaughtering them all. The Dioya system was at the very edge of Chiss territory, but nevertheless part of the Chiss Ascendancy. As such, the attack that occurred there warranted and in fact mandated a Chiss military response if culpability could be established. Ba'kif asked Thrawn to investigate the source of the attack, for which Thrawn required command of the ''Springhawk'' once again.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn was reinstated to his position on the ''Springhawk''. The ''Springhawk'' was navigated by the sky-walker [[Che'ri]], with Mitth'ali'astov \"Thalias\" serving as the girl's [[caregiver]]. As part of [[Picket Force Six]], Thrawn and his ship participated in an [[attack on the Paataatus]] along with [[Admiral]] Ar'alani. Thrawn's tactical insights were key to the Ascendancy's victory in that battle, as only Thrawn understood both [[Paataatus]] tactics and the fact that the locals had known the Chiss' attack vector. Ar'alani ordered the ''Springhawk'' to stay in a formation Thrawn knew to be tactically disadvantageous against the Paataatus. Thrawn disobeyed her order, and as a result, turned a rout into a Chiss victory and secured a \"groveling\" peace settlement from the [[Paataatus Hiveborn|Paataatus government]]. A tribunal was convened on Csilla to question Thrawn's disobedience of an order from Ar'alani, despite it being the reason the Chiss had won. However, Thrawn could not attend the tribunal because he and Ba'kif left to investigate the attack at Dioya.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nIn the Dioya system, Thrawn and Ba'kif boarded the doomed refugee vessel. Thrawn studied the ship's architecture and the clothing of the murdered refugees. Based on patterns in the dead refugees' clothing, Thrawn inferred that their society held females in high regard; information which he would use later. What Thrawn learned at Dioya led him to the [[Rapacc system]] not long after.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Reconnaissance at Rapacc=====\n{{Quote|We have everything Supreme General Ba'kif sent us to find. The murdered refugees were Paccosh from the Rapacc system, their oppressors are called the Nikardun, and the Nikardun leader is General Yiv the Benevolent.|Senior Captain Thrawn|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nThe ''Springhawk'' traveled to the Rapacc system, a [[box system]] where they saw unidentified naval forces patrolling. Two [[gas giant]] planets in the system, [[Shadow One]] and [[Shadow Two]], could be used for stealthy entry to or exit from the inner system where habitable planets would lie. The ''Springhawk'' [[Mission to the Rapacc system|investigated the inner system]], where its crew discovered an evidently-abandoned [[Unidentified Paccosh mining station|asteroid mining station]] that Thrawn sought to investigate. The ''Springhawk'' required all its officers to remain aboard, so Thrawn asked Caregiver Thalias to journey to the station with him. The ''Springhawk''{{'s}} helm officer [[Tumaz'mor'diamir|Azmordi]] initially objected to Caregiver Thalias and Sky-walker Che'ri's presence when discussing sensitive information, wishing it to remain within the [[senior officer corps]]. However, Thrawn insisted Che'ri and Thalias were part of his team and may have to perform extraordinary tasks at some point which would require their preparation and full knowledge of the situation. Thrawn then departed with Thalias aboard a shuttle.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAboard the [[space station]], Thrawn and Thalias signaled the exterior lights to invite any locals to meet them. They met a native [[Paccosh]] leader named [[Uingali foar Marocsaa]] who told him of the oppressive [[Nikardun Destiny]] led by the charismatic general [[Yiv|Yiv the Benevolent]]. The Paccosh, a species native to the [[star system]]'s titular planet [[Rapacc]], were besieged by [[Nikardun blockade frigate]]s and feared for the life of every last Pacc under the sword of the [[Nikardun]]. The Nikardun had disarmed the captive Paccosh people and starships, forcing them to explore the station unarmed. Uingali entrusted Thrawn with a [[Marocsaa subclan ring|double ring]] bearing an engraving of a [[Chimaera (symbol)|chimaera]],<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> which the Chiss would eventually come to adopt as his personal symbol.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\">{{Rebels|Through Imperial Eyes}}</ref> From the information he learned from the Paccosh, Thrawn became convinced the [[Nikardun conquests|expansionism]] of the Nikardun Destiny posed a far greater threat to the Ascendancy than the attackers behind the Csilla attack.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter departing the Rapacc system, Thrawn journeyed to Guild Concourse 447, where he hired Pathfinder Qilori to serve as the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} navigator. Qilori would navigate for the ''Springhawk'' to conduct a [[Raid on Rapacc|raid operation]] on the [[Nikardun military]] in the Rapacc system and capture a Nikardun blockade frigate. Thrawn believed that doing so would provide the Chiss with valuable tactical and cultural information about their Nikardun adversaries. Furthermore, Thrawn wished to gauge Qilori's actions during the raid, believing he could learn something about the Pathfinders' operations. The Chiss ultimately learned much about the military technology of the Nikardun from the captured [[warship]]. Moreover, the vessel's entire crew committed [[suicide]] prior to the Chiss boarding, which taught Thrawn and other Fleet officers the sheer willpower, hatred, and loyalty of [[Nikardun soldier]]s. Seeking to learn yet more about the Chiss' new adversary, Thrawn resolved to understand Yiv, and prepared a proposal to investigate the Lioaoin heartworld to present to Supreme General Ba'kif along with his after-action report.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Causing a stir and stirring up cause=====\n{{Quote|Interesting.

Ba'kif read Thrawn's report on the Rapacc missions at least twice while buying time to formulate a proper response. The General scolded Thrawn for capturing an enemy ship and Ar'alani for condoning Thrawn's choice of actions, saying the capture had been a serious breach of regulations. Thrawn pointed out that the ''Springhawk'' had acted in self-defense, which was permitted by standing orders. Nevertheless, the General distinguished between destroying an attacker and capturing their vessel, predicting that many Syndics would be furious upon learning of the capture. Ar'alani defended her subordinate, informing Ba'kif that she had studied the regulations and none had specifically prohibited the capture of an aggressor warship. Ba'kif considered capturing an enemy ship to fall under the category of preemptive strikes, which were expressly forbidden. Moreover, many Syndics and Aristocra would demand Thrawn return the captured Nikardun vessel. Upon this comment, Thrawn mused that such a transfer would be \"awkward\" without its crew, as they had all committed suicide before the Chiss could board the blockade [[frigate]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nBa'kif correctly predicted the Syndicure's outrage. Syndics Mitth'urf'ianico \"Thurfian\" and Irizi'stal'mustro \"Zistalmu\" were enraged at Thrawn's actions. Thrawn wished to go to the Lioaoin heartworld to see if the Lioaoi had fallen under Yiv's influence or alliance, but the angry politicians would not hear it. Instead, they demanded he join Ar'alani's [[Nightdragon man-of-war|''Nightdragon'' man-of-war]] [[Vigilant (Chiss Ascendancy)|''Vigilant'']] on a [[Urch incident|diplomatic mission]] to deliver a Chiss ambassador to [[Urch]], the homeworld of the [[Urchiv-ki]] species. The Ascendancy had signed a [[Chiss\u2014Urchiv-ki treaty|treaty]] with the Urchiv-ki to open diplomatic relations with the [[Tower Dimension]], and the ''Vigilant'' was chosen as the warship to deliver the ambassador [[Boadil'par'gasoi]] \"Ilparg\". Upon the ''Vigilant''{{'s}} arrival at Urch, the Tower Dimension refused to grant the Chiss clearance to land. Initially unknown to the Chiss on the scene, the Urchiv had been conquered by the Nikardun and coerced to lay a trap to try to capture a Chiss warship in response to Thrawn's capture of a Nikardun blockade frigate. The Tower Dimension's forces were reinforced by Lioaoin [[starfighter]]s. The Lioaoi demanded the ''Vigilant'' leave the system, and the ''Nightdragon'' man-of-war saw a Nikardun frigate before jumping to hyperspace.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nFrom the state of affairs in the [[Urch system]], Thrawn and Ar'alani learned a lot, including much of the information Thrawn had sought at the Lioaoin heartworld. Ilparg, angered by the very undiplomatic welcome he was extended as a Diplomat, demanded the ''Vigilant'' [[Mission to the Lioaoin heartworld|visit]] the heartworld to demand answers from the Lioaoin Regime. Defending Lioaoin [[gunboat]]s performed a [[pincer maneuver]], a decidedly non-Lioaoin tactic but one commonly used by the Nikardun military. [[Lioaoin Orbital Command]] denied any involvement in the Urch incident. Senior Captain Thrawn identified himself by name and claimed to be Ambassador Ilparg's supervisor, causing some of the gunboats to break formation at the mention of his name. From the fact that Thrawn's name alone was incitement to violence to the Nikardun, coupled with the pincer maneuver tactic, and that the Lioaoi remained armed unlike the Paccosh; Thrawn discerned the Lioaoi had been recruited as Nikardun allies rather than subjects.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Sizing up the enemy=====\n{{Quotetrans|He's more competent than he seems.''\u00bb<br />\u00ab''You think that display showed incompetence? You think just because there were no loud voices or discharged weapons that we didn't engage in combat? Trust me, Pathfinder. I understand this person now, and he is every bit as dangerous as you told me. You were wise to bring him to my attention, and then into my presence.|Pathfinder Qilori and General Yiv|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nThrawn came to understand that the Nikardun Destiny posed an insidious threat to his own Chiss Ascendancy. Furthermore, the Senior Captain believed that a skilled conqueror must understand the worldview, customs, and tactics of their conquered peoples. As such, he contrived the fictional role of a \"[[Chiss family hostage]]\" to convince the Nikardun General that he did not fully understand the Chiss and thereby erode his confidence in his ability to conquer the Chiss Ascendancy. Thrawn hoped that doing so would buy the Chiss time to fortify their defenses from a Nikardun invasion.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nSenior Captain Thrawn studied maps of the Chaos and discerned a pattern among nearby alien civilizations whose diplomatic and military behavior had recently undergone significant changes. The pattern Thrawn saw was one of encirclement of Chiss space by societies apparently suborned by a mixture of outright conquest and persuasion, which Thrawn correctly attributed to the Nikardun. Thrawn showed Thalias a map of the Chaos, highlighting nations on the Ascendancy's borders whose behavior toward the Chiss had markedly changed recently. Thrawn surmised that the Nikardun Destiny sought to encircle the Ascendancy, conquering neighboring civilizations so the Chiss could not engage in hostilities. Thalias suggested the Defense Force could deal with Yiv as they had the Paataatus. Thrawn replied that Paataatus culture indicated the Paataatus would not attack any Chiss for a generation. However, reports from Naporar indicated the Paataatus were already rearming for another attack. Consequently, Thrawn concluded that Yiv had conquered the Paataatus. Aware that Yiv preferred to smooth-talk his way into suborning species when he could, Senior Captain sought to meet the Nikardun General at a diplomatic event.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nFully aware that a Chiss officer of the Expansionary Defense Fleet could not merely walk in to a diplomatic event featuring General Yiv or his high-ranking lieutenants, Thrawn sought out his old Garwian contact Frangelic at the Garwian capital of Solitair. Frangelic, who had been promoted to [[Second Defense Overlord]] since their last meeting, informed Thrawn that the Garwian Unity would soon undertake a diplomatic mission to [[Primea]], the capital of the [[Vak Combine]] and the homeworld of the [[Vak]] species. Furthermore, Primea served as a diplomatic and trade hub for the region, so Thrawn would likely be able to learn about Yiv and his Nikardun there. Frangelic invited Thrawn and Thalias to join the Garwians' diplomatic mission, where Thrawn posed as \"Artistic Master Svorno\", [[chief curator]] of the [[Nunech Art Collection]]. Caregiver Thalias acted as Thrawn's Chiss family hostage, but was mainly referred to as Thrawn's \"companion\" to elicit intrigue and suspicion on the part of observers. Thrawn told Frangelic that he trusted the Security Chief, and thus let him in on his \"secret\" that Thalias was his \"family hostage\". In reality, Thrawn sought to plant enough seeds of the rumor of family hostages for them to reach Yiv, but not enough to look conspicuous as disinformation or lead to questions of why no one had ever heard of Chiss family hostages before. The Garwians hired Qilori of Uandualon to serve as their navigator to Primea.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter Thrawn and Thalias' arrival at the [[Primea diplomatic reception]], Thrawn discovered to his pleasure that Yiv was in attendance personally. Sighting Qilori, he admonished Thalias for wearing her hostage makeup \"incorrectly\", stating that a family hostage should meet certain criteria for appearances; doing so to make sure Qilori would overhear. Thrawn, posing as \"Artistic Master Svorno,\" engaged Qilori in conversation about an academic theory he claimed to be trying to refute. However, Thrawn gave up the topic of conversation after realizing that it was not of interest to Qilori. The Pathfinder smiled internally, reflecting that for all of Thrawn's aliases and disguises, he could never successfully impersonate an academic until he realized that academics loved to \"rattle on\" about their specialties regardless of their audiences' interest in the subject. Thrawn then asked Qilori to introduce him to Yiv. The Chiss said he knew about most of the species present and that few of those have art that was \"worthy of the name,\" but had never met one of \"those\" (a Nikardun) before. Qilori happily obliged, as the Pathfinder wished to bring Thrawn before Yiv as well.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nYiv discussed art and architecture with \"Svorno,\" who was in fact Senior Captain Thrawn. The Chiss and the Nikardun challenged one-another to analyze something that was not their counterpart's specialization; so Yiv would analyze a work of art while \"Svorno\" analyzed architecture. Yiv discussed the implications of a secret tunnel from the reception area to the Vak premier's private office. Thrawn studied a Vak tapestry that Yiv believed showed \"inexpert\" design, but Thrawn retorted that it in fact showed that the Vaks valued both the individual and the whole; \"working for unity while at the same time celebrating difference and uniqueness.\" This cultural information would prove crucial during a confrontation between Thrawn and Yiv in the [[Primea system]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn said that he saw at the reception a great deal of artwork, all of which displayed the Vaks' cultural ethos. The Chiss then asked the Nikardun General what he saw, to which Yiv responded \"Opportunity.\" Yiv elaborated that he saw opportunity to \"make new friends\" with the Vak people. Thrawn then asked Yiv what would happen if the Vaks did not want the Nikardun's friendship. Yiv responded that he would see it as an insult. The Chiss asked if such an insult would need to be \"avenged,\" to which Yiv insisted that it would need to be \"dealt with\" and that \"avenged\" was \"far too savage\" a word to use. The General complimented Thrawn on his observational skills, and the Chiss retired to his quarters.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter Thrawn's departure, Qilori discussed the Chiss with his Nikardun employer. Yiv said that he now understood Thrawn and the danger he posed to the Nikardun. He complimented the Navigator for bringing Thrawn before him. Qilori then brought up the subject of Chiss family hostages he had observed, which led Yiv to begin to second-guess his knowledge of the Chiss.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Escaping Primea=====\n{{Quote|The first thing Yiv will probably assume is that we'll try to steal a ship.''\"<br />\"''Indeed he will.''\"<br />\"''So where are we going?''\"<br />\"''To the spaceport, to steal a ship.|Thalias and Thrawn|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nYiv planned to capture and kill Thrawn as the Garwian diplomatic ship left Primea, but Thrawn was not aboard. Instead, he and Thalias remained on the planet to learn about the Vak culture and how the Vaks would respond to Yiv's diplomatic and military overtures. The two Chiss entered a [[Vak art gallery]] where Thrawn learned more about Vak culture and discussed the opinions of \"the common [Vak] people\" with the museum's [[curator]]. Thalias opined that the people who frequent art galleries would not be the decision-makers of their species, to which Thrawn replied that she did not see what he saw.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nHe explained that the Vaks valued ''all'' of their members' points of view, which they called \"[[thought line]]s,\" and as such they sought consensus making decisions. Decision-making so thoroughly communal made the Vak Combine slower in deciding their policies and courses of action than most sentient species. However, the Vak would distrust a faction which sought to subordinate the Vaks' many thought lines to those of the faction's leader. Yiv would no doubt seek to make his own thought line the only one that mattered. Thrawn and Thalias sought to spread that warning before they were caught by Nikardun or Vak security forces.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn and Thalias stole a [[Thrawn's patrol boat|patrol boat]] from the [[Vak spaceport]] to make their escape, and fitted it with the shipping box Frangelic and Thrawn had prepared to serve as their quarters. Thrawn incapacitated the Vak pilot with [[tava]] mist, disabling the pilot for a short time with no lasting harm. As they departed, Thrawn discussed Thalias' motive for joining the ''Springhawk''. She revealed that she wanted to see Thrawn again, as she believed he had \"changed her life\". The caregiver recounted their [[#Cadet at Taharim Academy|encounter]] aboard the ''Tomra'' on Thrawn's first space-flight. She had felt dejected and miserable and believed her life was over, but Thrawn gave her hope by telling her that she could choose her path in life. Thrawn took a long moment to reply; at which point Thalias thought he only sounded \"thoughtful\", rather than sympathetic, encouraging, or even responsive. He told the caregiver of his sister who had gone missing without a trace when he was three years old; whom he had long presumed dead and knew he would never see again. He now understood that she had the gift of Third Sight and was thus taken to be a sky-walker for the Defense Force. He said in a bittersweet tone that he would still never see her again. Thalias told Thrawn there must be personnel records he could use to locate his sister, hoping to ameliorate her commander's sadness. However, Thrawn knew that most former sky-walkers hoped to disappear into anonymity after their service and chose to respect his birth sister's wishes to do so.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Yiv's allies attack=====\n{{Dialogue|Zistalmu|Are you mad?

Ar'alani commanded the ''Vigilant'' and was accompanied by the ''Springhawk'', temporarily under Mid Captain Samakro's command. Ar'alani was accompanied by Syndic Zistalmu, who sought to ensure the two Chiss ships would obey the Chiss non-aggression protocols. The Chiss force called the Primea diplomatic office to ask the whereabouts of \"artistic master Svorno\" (i.e., Thrawn). The Vaks responded that the Garwian diplomatic ship had departed three [[Standard day|days]] ago.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nMeanwhile. the Chiss ships were met by thirteen [[Vak patrol boat]]s arranged in a lens formation. The local [[patrol boat]]s and Chiss warships engaged in limited shows of force against each other, sufficient to demonstrate the capability to engage if necessary but limited enough to display a lack of desire for combat. A fourteenth Vak patrol boat, secretly piloted by Thrawn, soon joined the other thirteen. Thrawn's patrol boat opened fire on the ''Vigilant'' with modulated laserfire in what appeared to be a Vak attack on the Chiss. In actuality, Thrawn was sending Admiral Ar'alani the schematics of the Vak patrol boats so she and the ''Springhawk'' could disable them without destroying them; using the same communication method he had devised for the Stivic incident. Much to Syndic Zistalmu's outrage, Ar'alani used Thrawn's apparent attack to justify engaging the Vak patrol boats.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nJust before the ''Vigilant'' could fire to disable the Vak fighters, four Lioaoin warships appeared from hyperspace. The Lioaoi flagship hailed Ar'alani, positively identifying themselves as part of the [[Lioaoin military]] and telling the Chiss they had disrupted the peace of the Vak Combine. They warned the Chiss to depart immediately. Ar'alani replied that they were only there to search for one of their people, at which point the Lioaoi [[Attack at Primea|attacked the Chiss force]]. Ar'alani knew that she and Samakro did not have enough [[plasma sphere]]s to destroy all their attackers, so they planned a quick escape. Syndic Zistalmu was further angered because, \"now that they were ''actually'' attacked,\" Ar'alani wanted to leave.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Striking back at the Lioaoi=====\n{{Dialogue|Thrawn|Don't worry, they aren't all coming for us.|Dalvu|Certainly looks like they are.|Samakro|Watch your tone, Mid Commander.

Either way, they'll want to keep the bulk of their force close in for protection.|attr=Senior Captain Thrawn, Mid Commander Dalvu and Mid Captain Samakro discuss the defending Lioaoin forces.|src=Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nWhile Chiss Ascendancy law prohibited preemptive strikes against non-enemies, it required retaliatory strikes against enemy forces who definitively established their identity. As such, the Lioaoin attack at Primea required the Expansionary Defense Fleet to counterattack the Lioaoin Regime. The Syndicure and Defense Hierarchy Council sent the ''Vigilant'' and ''Springhawk'' to [[Lioaoin skirmish|attack the Lioaoin heartworld]]. Unknown to most of the vessels' crews, Thrawn and Ar'alani wished to only attack using the two warships, rather than bringing a larger force.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nOn the way to the Lioaoin heartworld, Thrawn and his officers discussed the philosophy of war and what they had learned about the Nikardun Destiny. The ''Springhawk''{{'s}} [[second officer]] Senior Commander [[Plikh'ar'illmorf]] \"Kharill\" mused that this attack was madness, to which Samakro responded that the ancient Chiss [[philosopher]]s would consider all warfare madness. Kharill expressed a desire for a few years of peace, even if that peace left the Chiss Defense Force personnel unemployed. Thrawn asked Kharill how that peace should be achieved, and the Senior Commander retreated. With Samakro, Thrawn reasoned that the Lioaoi were Yiv's allies, and Yiv had ordered them to Primea to engage the Chiss so neither the Nikardun nor the Vaks would have to expend their own forces. The Senior Captain said Yiv would judge the Ascendancy's will to conduct reprisals during the coming battle; and as such, the Chiss' goal should be to maximize the message they would send while minimizing the actual damage inflicted on the Lioaoin Regime.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn guided his first officer Samakro to reason why their attack force consisted of only two warships. The reasoning amounted to a confluence of several factors. First, by deeming only two warships adequate to perform their reprisal, the Chiss Ascendancy would project supreme confidence. Second, small forces were best able to evaluate enemy tactics. Thrawn added that Ar'alani had requested only two ships for the engagement, and a single ship would have been even better for tactical evaluation. However, the Defense Hierarchy Council would not have allowed only one ship to perform the mission. Thrawn added that the Syndicure was happy enough to grant Ar'alani's request for only two ships, as many would be confident in the two ships' powers and some may hope Thrawn and Ar'alani would be killed.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nUpon the Chiss force's arrival at the Lioaoin heartworld, they saw twelve Lioaoin warships. Thrawn knew that no more than four would engage the ''Springhawk'' and ''Vigilant'', as the Chiss had a reputation that they would have reinforcements lying in wait. If the Lioaoi were to send their whole defensive fleet to engage two Chiss ships, they would open their planet to attack by the Chiss reinforcements they believed would come. At that time, Ar'alani hailed the Lioaoin ships, asking for an \"explanation\" of their attack at Primea. The Lioaoi did not attempt to deny or justify the attack, leading Thrawn to reason that Nikardun forces were present and the Lioaoi feared reprisals by the Nikardun if they should downplay their aggression at Primea. A battle ensued, with the ''Springhawk'' and ''Vigilant'' using shuttles as decoys and bombs containing [[breacher]] missiles which weakened enemy [[hull]]s and disabled nearby electronic systems. The Chiss emerged victorious, maximizing their detterent message while minimizing permanent damage to the Lioaoin Regime in the hopes that the Lioaoi would remember the Ascendancy's restraint in the future. The ''Springhawk'' sustained heavy damage in the battle.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Planning next steps=====\n{{Quote|There are several possibilities.

The Admiral and General were now convinced of the threat posed by the Nikardun, but the Defense Hierarchy Council and the Syndicure were not. Thrawn proposed conducting reconnaissance behind Nikardun lines. He would take a small scout ship able to evade pursuit and learn the size, strength, and degree of control the Nikardun Destiny exercised over its subjects. Ba'kif agreed that such a mission was possible, but asked the Senior Captain \"to what end\" it would be undertaken.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn initially replied that the scout mission could incite the Nikardun's conquered peoples to revolt against their conquerors. Ba'kif shot the idea down as a violation of the Ascendancy's prohibition on preemptive military action. The Senior Captain then proposed leasing military bases or supply depots from nations occupied by the Nikardun; however, the General rejected that idea on the same grounds. Finally, Thrawn proposed searching for allies who may have been able to resist Nikardun conquest and keep such resistance unknown to Yiv. Despite believing the chances of such potential allies existing to be slim, Ba'kif granted Thrawn permission to undertake a search for allies. Further, the Supreme General allowed Senior Captain Thrawn to bring navigator Che'ri and caregiver Thalias with him. Ba'kif warned Thrawn that the younger officer would not only be risking his own life, but also those of Che'ri and Thalias. Thrawn understood the gravity of the situation, but insisted that he would rather cause Che'ri and Thalias' deaths through his actions than cause the deaths of the entire Ascendancy through inaction. Reluctantly, Ba'kif agreed. The general told Thrawn his orders would be \"cut but sealed,\" meaning they would be official and binding, but no-one but Ba'kif and Ar'alani would know about them. Ba'kif wished Thrawn good luck as the younger man left.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn left Ba'kif's office to meet Thalias and Che'ri, who had been waiting outside. Despite her clearance to accompany Thrawn on his mission, Thalias was prevented from coming when Syndic Thurfian pulled her aside to report on Thrawn. Thalias refused to be Thurfian's spy against Thrawn, but could nevertheless not accompany her Senior Captain and sky-walker charge on their mission. Instead, Thalias resolved to take the Mitth family Trials, proving herself worthy of being a Trial-born of the Mitth. In the meantime, Thrawn asked Che'ri if she still wished to undergo the planned mission without her caregiver. Che'ri agreed, understanding the importance of the mission, and asked Thrawn to give her more colored [[graph marker]]s.

Their search was to take place within and beyond the Unknown Regions. While exploring the edge of the Choas, Thrawn began teaching Che'ri how to fly a starship. Che'ri had drawn aerial landscapes, [[bird]]s, and many other flying entities, and the Senior Captain recognized the young girl's desire to fly reflected in her drawings. Che'ri became more confident and admitted her love of flying, and came to believe that Thrawn was an excellent teacher.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n[[File:Thrawn_Alliances_Anakin_art.png|thumb|right|300x330px|Thrawn encountered Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars.]]\nNot long after reaching the [[Outer Rim Territories]] of \"Lesser Space\", Thrawn and Che'ri detected an [[Deflector shield|energy shield]] far more advanced than the [[electrostatic barrier]]s used for warship defense in the Unknown Regions.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> The energy shield was deployed to protect a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] base on the world of [[Mokivj]] which they would later discover was a [[battle droid]] factory.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> They also waited above the Outer Rim planet [[Batuu]] in search of possible allies and briefly spoke with [[Duja]], whom they inferred to be a [[scout]] or [[spy]] for the [[Galactic Republic]].

Thrawn sought Skywalker's assistance in learning of the pan-galactic [[Clone Wars]] and the state of the galaxy. The [[Jedi Knight]] agreed to help in return for Thrawn's [[Mission to Batuu (Clone Wars)|assistance]] locating [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and Duja. The pair descended to Batuu's surface along with the Jedi's [[astromech droid]] companion [[R2-D2]].<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> Che'ri was left alone to take care of Thrawn's ship and to deploy decoys when they would be needed.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> Skywalker told the Chiss about the Clone Wars, which saw the Confederacy of Independent Systems' [[Separatist Droid Army]] allayed against the Jedi and [[clone trooper]]s of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nThrawn and Skywalker found Padm\u00e9's [[H-type Nubian yacht]] in a small [[forest]] clearing thirty kilometers from the settlement known as [[Black Spire Outpost]]. There, Skywalker fought a group of [[smuggler]]s upset at the presence of Amidala's ship in their landing spot, leading Thrawn to break up the fight. Together, he, Skywalker, and R2-D2 investigated Padm\u00e9's Nubian yacht. They found no sign of forced entry, but found logs indicating that Duja's ship, a [[Nomad Four]], had left a week before Amidala's arrival. The two made arrangements to travel to Black Spire to continue their search.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nSkywalker and Thrawn visited a [[Oga's Cantina|cantina]] in Black Spire Outpost, where they asked the bartender about Padm\u00e9 and Duja's whereabouts. The two were attacked by four assailants, but subdued and killed their attackers. Thrawn was wounded in the fight, but luckily his [[Chiss uniform]] absorbed and dissipated much of the energy from blasterfire. Thrawn deduced that the assailants had come to assassinate Skywalker and that a fifth companion was still at large. To track down the fifth companion, Skywalker came up with a plan to make it appear that one of the [[human]] assassins survived, wherein Skywalker would use the Force to animate the assassin's corpse. In the meantime, Thrawn installed [[listening device]]s at the cantina. Because of Skywalker's Force-sensititivy and employment of the Force in combat, Thrawn deduced that he was either a Jedi or a [[Sith]]. Because the Chiss myths of Jedi and Sith portrayed the Sith as clever and capable warriors, and because Skywalker had made careless mistakes in the skirmish, Thrawn inferred he was a Jedi.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nThrawn and R2-D2 returned to Skywalker's Jedi starfighter with the assassin's body. While Skywalker and R2 flew with the body, an explosion in the ''Actis''{{'}} portside [[repulsorlift]] caused it to descend rapidly. Skywalker managed to regain control of the ship and landed it among the trees, where he was attacked by a [[droid]] assassin.

The wounded Thrawn rammed their landspeeder into their attackers. Following a fight, Anakin and Thrawn subdued the assailants. They questioned two [[prisoner]]s, including a cargo inspector named [[Oenti]]. One of the prisoners revealed that the bartender [[Janott]] had connections to the pro-Separatist [[Duke]] [[Solha]] of [[Serenno]], the same planet whence the Separatist [[Head of State]] [[Count]] [[Dooku]] hailed. Questioning their prisoners, Thrawn and Anakin determined that Padm\u00e9's handmaiden Duja had discovered that the smugglers were using Batuu to smuggle supplies to a Separatist droid factory and that Duja had entered a Separatist ship and contacted the Republic. However, Oenti's comrades had realized she was a spy, causing them to panic and attempt to ship their gains off-world. However, before their ship had arrived, the landing space had been occupied by Ambassador Amidala's ship.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nOenti confirmed that Padm\u00e9 Amidala had landed at Black Spire and wrote a poem for the deceased Duja. Janott and Oenti denied killing Duja, and Anakin confirmed they were being truthful. When Thrawn announced that they would head to the Separatist base on Mokivj, Oenti and his companions attacked Thrawn and his Jedi ally. Using [[Skywalker lightsaber|his lightsaber]], Anakin slew the assailants except for Janott. Janott confirmed that Padm\u00e9 survived and left in a different ship.

Thrawn briefly left after securing the [[deflector shield generator]], claiming to Amidala that it had been his mission. Nonetheless, he returned to help the Jedi and his wife defeat the Separatists. The Separatists had a [[cortosis mine]] and a [[Mokivj droid factory|droid factory]] on Mokivj where they were manufacturing [[cortosis B2 super battle droid]]s to fight the [[Jedi Order]]. [[Cortosis]] was able to withstand energy weapons like [[blaster]] bolts and [[lightsaber]]s, making cortosis-fortified armor deadly against Jedi and clone [[trooper]]s alike. As a result, Skywalker and Amidala insisted on destroying the Confederacy's ability to produce the cortosis-armored droids before leaving Mokivj. Thrawn suggested that they sabotage the droids so the Separatists would waste valuable resources on a flawed project doomed to fail, but Skywalker insisted on destroying the [[Mining|mine]] where the cortosis was acquired. This caused a catastrophe that rendered Mokivj barren and inhospitable.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> Che'ri returned near the end of the mission, helping the Chiss and Republic individuals distract and defeat Separatist [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|vulture droids]] protecting the base in air and space.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn was impressed with Skywalker's courage and cunning, while Skywalker was also impressed with Thrawn, and spoke highly of him to [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] when he returned to [[Coruscant]]. Thrawn was unimpressed, however, with the state of the Republic. He believed it to be unfit for an alliance with the Chiss Ascendancy, citing that the Republic's [[Democracy|democratic]] style of government created a bloated, inert system where everyone had a voice but nothing was accomplished. Thrawn believed that a system of governance that encompassed so many points of view, styles of political thought, and philosophies was sluggish and inefficient by nature. Nevertheless, Thrawn's association with Skywalker was later made known, passed along in rumors among people who mined in the [[Thrugii asteroid belt]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Fall of the Nikardun Destiny====\n<!-- ''Chaos Rising'' after Thrawn's return from Mokivj -->\n=====Return to the Chiss=====\n{{Quote|Sixth job is probably to get Ba'kif and Ja'fosk to sign off on this.''\"<br />\"''I was thinking of waiting on that until after Che'ri and Thalias have left.|Senior Captain Thrawn and Admiral Ar'alani|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nFive [[Standard week|weeks]] after their departure from Csilla, Thrawn and Che'ri returned to the Chiss with the deflector shield generator they called the \"Republic energy shield\". Upon his return, Thrawn met with Admiral Ar'alani and Supreme General Ba'kif to make plans to defeat General Yiv and his Nikardun forces. The officers understood that the capture of a Senior Captain by forces not considered an enemy of the Ascendancy would not be considered an act of war sufficient to merit a Chiss military response. However, the capture of a flag officer or sky-walker ''would'' merit military action. Thus, Thrawn and Ar'alani hatched a plan.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Setting up the trap=====\n{{Quote|Speakers and Syndics of the Ascendancy, I've received a transmission from General Yiv of the Nikardun Destiny. Quote:''\"<br />\u00ab''I have in my possession the two family hostages of Senior Captain Thrawn, whom he sent to Primea with an offer to the Vak Combine of union and treachery against the peaceful peoples of the Nikardun Destiny. If he wishes the females to be released unharmed, he will travel alone to the attached coordinates in an unarmed freighter with the equivalent of two hundred thousand Univers.''\u00bb<br />\"''The coordinates given indicate a high orbit over Primea.|Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nThrawn would send sky-walker Che'ri and Caregiver Thalias to Primea aboard the Vak patrol boat he had stolen with an apology and a warning to the Vak Combine. In fact, Thalias carried one copy of Thrawn's message to the Combine while a second and longer copy was stored in the patrol boat's computer. The copy in the returned ship included a warning that Yiv might capture Thalias and Che'ri and replace the contents of their message with something innocuous. If the copy the Vaks' leaders received matched the copy aboard the ship's computer, then all was fairly calm and they would have time to deliberate. However, if the messages did not match, that would indicate the Nikardun General had altered the message and could therefore not be trusted; thus leading to a shift in Vak thought lines to oppose the Nikardun Destiny.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n[[File:Star Wars Thrawn 1 Textless.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Thrawn prepared to stop Yiv's advance once and for all, bringing back his fake concept of Chiss family hostages.]]\nChe'ri was nominally aboard the Vak patrol boat because she knew how to pilot the ship while Thalias did not (and that was true); but in reality, Thrawn and Ar'alani required Yiv capture the young sky-walker to convince the Syndicure to conduct a military strike against the Nikardun. Thrawn's warning to the Vak Combine included data he had collected on other civilizations that Yiv had made entreaties to, with which he hoped to convince the Vaks that Yiv's promises and flattery were in fact deception prefacing an iron fist that would follow if they should accept Yiv's suzerainty. Moreover, it included an invitation for the Vak Combine to form a military alliance with the Chiss Ascendancy against the Nikardun. (Notably, Thrawn was not authorized to propose such an alliance.)<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThe two female Chiss were dressed up as Chiss family hostages and told to give their message directly to the highest-ranking defense official in the Vak Combine. Thrawn and Thalias expected that their message would be intercepted and replaced by an agent of Yiv, but did not tell Che'ri that detail. He prepared for this possibility by including a second copy of his warning on the databanks of the returned patrol boat's computer with an additional message added. The second message, which was only present in the starship's computer, warned the Vaks that if the message they receive from Thalias and Che'ri differed from that on the vessel's computer, then Yiv was lying to them and they should hasten to make a decision to form an alliance with the Chiss.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAs Thrawn expected, General Yiv captured Thalias and Che'ri, taking them hostage. He sent a message to the Csilla demanding that Thrawn deliver a monetary ransom aboard an unarmed freighter in exchange for the release of the captive Chiss. The message specified coordinates representing high [[orbit]] of Primea, and demanded that Thrawn come alone in an unarmed freighter. Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk called an emergency session at Csilla's [[Convocate Hall]] to deliver the news to an outraged Syndicure. While Syndic Thurfian had often seen Thrawn skirt or step over the limits of acceptable and legal behavior for a Chiss officer, he was completely unprepared for the news that Thrawn's actions had led to the capture of a Sky-walker. Thurfian privately fumed that such an act was [[treason]] against the Ascendancy.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nCalled to testify before the Syndics, Thrawn explained that he had never intended to place either woman in harm's way, and asserted that it was Yiv's aggressive actions that endangered Thalias and Che'ri; not his own. One Syndic asked how Thrawn could have allowed a valuable sky-walker to fall into \"enemy\" hands, to which Ja'fosk replied that the Nikardun Destiny was not the Ascendancy's enemy. The Syndics and Ja'fosk discussed whether Yiv might know of the existence of Chiss sky-walker navigators; concluding that there was neither evidence that he did or did not. The Syndics remained furious and demanded action be taken to rescue Che'ri, even if that action constituted a military strike; and an expedition to Primea was authorized. A [[Unidentified Irizi Speaker|Speaker]] for the Irizi family effectively ended the meeting by saying they would have more questions for Thrawn and Ar'alani, but they could wait until after Che'ri and Thalias were rescued.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nIt was decided that Thrawn would travel to Guild Concourse 447 and hire a navigator to take his [[Thrawn's freighter|unarmed freighter]] to the coordinates Yiv had specified. If Thrawn failed to retrieve Thalias and Che'ri on his own, a Chiss fleet would soon follow and arrive at Primea. In reality, Yiv had arranged for the navigator to be Qilori and for Qilori to bring Thrawn and the freighter somewhere in the outer reaches of the Primea system. Thrawn expected as much and would later invoke Yiv's treachery to justify the Chiss fleet that followed him to Primea. Thrawn had studied the schematics of Yiv's flagship Battle Dreadnought the ''[[Deathless]]'', which sported an overly large viewport as did many other Nikardun vessels. He had the Fleet make special modifications to the freighter he would take to the Councourse and then to Primea, so its nose would first puncture and then perfectly seal a vacuum in the viewport of the ''Deathless''{{'}} bridge. Additionally, the Fleet had installed a prototype \"Republic energy shield\" on the freighter, reverse-engineered from the one Thrawn had acquired on Mokivj and far stronger than any shielding technology commonly employed in the Unknown Regions at the time. Nevertheless, the freighter was bereft of [[weapon]]s as required.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====The Chiss fleet arrives=====\n{{Quotetrans|Do I assume that since the location for our meeting was changed, all the rest of the original provisions are no longer in force?''\u00bb<br />\u00ab''Probably.

The part about me coming to Primea alone.|Thrawn and Yiv|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nUpon Thrawn's arrival to the outer Primea system, Thrawn and Qilori saw the ''Deathless'' accompanied by three other [[Nikardun Battle Dreadnought]]s. Thrawn hailed Yiv over the comm to announce his arrival to the General and that he had the specified monetary ransom. Yiv said that Thrawn misunderstood, and that Thrawn was himself to serve as the ransom. The Nikardun told the Chiss officer that he had [[Death mark|earned death]] for capturing and killing one of his ships and crews. Yiv asked Thrawn whether he wished the General to shoot his freighter down rather than bring him aboard to be killed personally, to which Thrawn replied that he did not. The Chiss commended Yiv for his cleverness in arranging the meeting at a different location than promised, and asked if that meant the other \"provisions\" of the meeting had changed too. The General quipped \"probably\" before proceeding to brag about the Vaks' awareness of his substantial military forces in the system and nearby. As Thrawn's freighter approached the ''Deathless'', Thrawn said he wished to revisit the provision that he come to Primea alone.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAt that time, the ''Vigilant'', ''Springhawk'', and other Chiss cruisers arrived in the Primea system from hyperspace. They called [[Primea Central Command]] to announce their arrival and inform the locals of the presence of Nikardun warships. After the Chiss vessels performed a [[sensor]] scan, the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} second officer Kharill noted that the Nikardun dreadnoughts had formed a [[blockade]] formation, to which Mid Captain Samakro and [[sensor officer]] [[Elod'al'vumic]] \"Dalvu\" agreed. The Chiss understood that the blockade was meant to prevent the Vaks or any others in the system from stumbling upon Yiv's covert meeting with Thrawn, but the Vaks had no reason to suspect such a motive. Ar'alani sent the Nikardun formation data to Primea Central Command, who understood it to mean they were the subject of a planetary blockade by the Nikardun Destiny. Ar'alani asked for the Vaks' permission to clear out the blockading vessels from the system, which they granted. Included in her message was a plan by which the Vaks could join the battle on the side of the Chiss if they wished. As a result, the [[battle over Primea]] ensued. The battle began between the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet on one side and the Nikardun on the other, but the Vak Combine would eventually join on the side of the Chiss.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====Confronting Yiv=====\n{{Quotetrans|Your people will die for this.

This region will no longer accept your smiles and promises.|General Yiv and Senior Captain Thrawn|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nYiv was furious upon seeing the arrival of the Chiss fleet at Primea. Thrawn further angered the General by pointing out a dilemma the Chiss had set for Yiv. The Chiss fleet was much stronger than the Nikardun patrol boats forming the apparent blockade of Primea. Yiv could sacrifice those small warships; but that would bring disgrace on Yiv as the Vaks knew that Yiv had stronger [[Battle Dreadnought class|battle dreadnoughts]] that could reinforce his patrol boats. On the other hand, Yiv could send his dreadnoughts to reinforce his blockade formation, but if he sent all of them, it would appear he was fleeing Thrawn and his unarmed freighter. Moreover, even if Yiv sent all three of the ''Deathless''{{'}} companion dreadnoughts to reinforce his blockade ships, it would appear that Yiv was too cowardly to join the battle himself. Ultimately, that third option is what an apoplectic Yiv settled on.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nYiv, extremely angered at the trap laid before him, began hurting Thalias to try to learn Thrawn's plan. Thrawn, still on the comm display, informed the Nikardun that there was no need for such actions, and laid out his plan transparently for the General. Thrawn sought to trap Yiv in a box, which he insisted he had. He told Yiv the only way forward would be for Yiv to capture Thrawn's freighter with the ''Deathless''{{'}} tractor beams and release Thalias and Che'ri, as provided in the two men's original \"agreement.\" Yiv smugly chided that he had always wished something like that, but said he would kill and dismember Che'ri and Thalias in front of Thrawn so the Chiss Senior Captain would die knowing he had brought such a fate on all Chiss.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n[[File:Orlando-Thrawn-cover.jpg|200px|thumb|right|As Yiv's efforts collapsed around them, Thrawn confronted the general on his bridge.]]\nMeanwhile, Admiral Ar'alani told Mid Captain Samakro, now commanding the ''Springhawk'', to \"play dead,\" and appealed to several non-combatant Vak patrol boats for humanitarian aid. The Vaks agreed after a short period of protest, but were promptly shot and destroyed by several Nikardun warships. The Vak culture treated an attack on any Vak as an attack on the entire Vak Combine, so the Vak forces promptly joined the battle against the Nikardun on the side of the Chiss fleet. Away from the ''Deathless'' and Thrawn's freighter, the climactic battle quickly turned against the Nikardun due to the Vaks adopting Ar'alani's battle plan.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nBy now, Yiv was apoplectic. He ordered Thrawn's freighter to be brought in by tractor beams and fired at with spectrum lasers simultaneously. Just at that moment, Che'ri and Thalias stripped their hostage disguise and released tava mist, inhibiting the reaction time and reflexes of the ''Deathless''{{'}} bridge crew. Using the Republic shield generator technology the fleet had installed, Thrawn's freighter endured the Nikardun laser fire without significant harm, even though the lasers would have been strong enough to easily destroy the freighter if it had only been equipped with the electrostatic barriers common in the Chaos. Thrawn's ship crashed into the bridge of the ''Deathless'', at first opening the viewport up to vacuum before sealing it with the perfectly-shaped custom nose the Expansionary Defense Fleet had installed on Thrawn's freighter. Thrawn then rescued Che'ri and Thalias from the Nikardun, knocked Yiv unconscious with more tava mist, and seized the General, his [[questis data-link reader]], and his data banks before escaping with his friends and prisoner. The departure of Thrawn's freighter once again opened the bridge of the ''Deathless'' to the vacuum, killing all of Yiv's bridge crew and thus leaving \"no witnesses,\" as the General himself had wished.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====The Nikardun collapse=====\n{{Quotetrans|Yiv ''was'' the Nikardun Destiny.

Thrawn also made one of Yiv's agents, the Pathfinder Qilori, promise not to tell anyone how Yiv had been defeated, or else he would be removed from the Pathfinders, and the Pathfinders themselves would be removed from the Navigators' Guild. However, when another enemy of the Chiss,<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> a [[Grysk]]<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" /> calling himself [[Jixtus]], threatened to leave the Pathfinder on a derelict ship [[light-year]]s from any star system, Qilori told him that Thrawn was the Chiss who had taken down Yiv. Wanting revenge on the Chiss himself, Qilori also agreed to ally with Jixtus.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nFollowing the battle over Primea, the Syndicure called several hearings regarding the Nikardun threat, how they had been discovered, and how they were defeated. Mid Captain Samakro recalled that most Aristocra had \"perfunctory\" questions for the Fleet officers, but Syndic Thurfian had a singular vendetta against Thrawn and the officers of the ''Springhawk''. After Yiv's capture and interrogation, the Syndicure became convinced that the remnants of Yiv's forces must be eliminated. As such, they authorized the [[Nikardun campaigns]] to neutralize any Nikardun remnants in the Chaos. Thrawn participated in the campaigns.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nJixtus had expected Yiv's efforts against the Chiss Ascendancy to fail. He thus had servants of the [[Grysk Hegemony]], including the [[Telepathy|telepathic]] [[Agbui]] named [[Haplif]], conduct a [[Plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy|plot to instigate a civil war]] among the Chiss.

As such, the two Syndics began amplifying rumors of an alliance between the Paataatus and the Vagaari pirates, knowing that the Syndicure would be eager to send Thrawn against two enemies he had thoroughly routed in the past. In addition, Thrawn's acquisition of a gravity well generator from the Vagaari pirate operations was famous among the Nine Ruling Families, and the Syndics would hope Thrawn could secure more promising alien technology in further combat against the Vagaari.

The Paccosh had heard legends that the Chiss were able to disable enemies without inflicting any permanent damage. Uingali thus challenged Thrawn to prove his Chiss-hood by launching a shuttle for the ''Springhawk'' to disable harmlessly. Thrawn obliged, having [[weapons officer]] [[Chaf'pri'uhme]] \"Afpriuh\" disable the shuttle with a plasma sphere. The Senior Captain then revealed that he had come to Rapacc to ensure the Nikardun had been driven out, and to return Uingali's Marocsaa subclan ring bearing the image of a chimaera. Thrawn then correctly identified the commandeered frigate's captain as his old friend Uingali. Upon showing the ring to Uingali over the viewscreen, the Pacc smiled, welcoming Thrawn to his world. Shortly thereafter, Uingali's frigate turned upward to reveal a massive ventral decal of a chimaera.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nUingali took Thrawn, Thalias, and Samakro to Rapacc's capital city of [[Boropacc]], which was largely destroyed. Uingali told his Chiss guests that most of the destruction had been by the Nikardun as they withdrew from the planet, but some of it had come from the Paccosh in their eagerness to kill as many Nikardun as they could on their way out. The Pacc then told the Chiss the true purpose of his invitation. Uingali's Paccosh people had come to host 200 refugees of a [[The Magys species|mysterious species]] seven and a half months prior, which was three months before Thrawn's first encounter with the Paccosh aboard the mining station. Those refugees had a matriarchal society and were led by a female figure known as [[the Magys]]. The Magys' people had fled a [[Sunrise civil war|disastrous civil war]] on their homeworld and believed that all others of their species were dead. Uingali also reveled to Thrawn and his companions that the Nikardun had originally invaded the Rapacc system in order to hunt down the Magys' refugee group, stating that \"grief is the child of mercy.\"<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nBelieving that her two-hundred refugees were the only members of their species to survive their homeworld's war, the Magys wished mass-suicide for her people. She believed their only hope would be to become one with the Force by joining \"the Beyond.\" Uingali explained that The Magys had to wait for nine of her people's months without hearing from any higher authority from her planet before she could command her refugees to commit suicide;<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> that time translated to approximately eight standard months.<ref name=\"Magys months conversion\">Uingali stated in ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' that the Magys had been present on Rapacc for seven and a half [[Standard month|months]], and calculated that her nine-month timetable for suicide was approximately two [[Standard week|weeks]] thereafter. Seven and a half months plus two weeks is approximately eight standard months.</ref> By the time of the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} arrival, trust had frayed between the refugees and their Paccosh hosts. However, the aliens had expressed intrigue when Uingali had told them about a group of aliens (Thrawn and Thalias) who had visited the Paccosh seeking to preserve their art. Thus, after driving their Nikardun oppressors from the Rapacc system, Uingali contacted the Chiss Ascendancy and requested Thrawn, Thalias, and the ''Springhawk'' come to help their dispute. Uingali believed Thalias would be needed to dissuade the Magys from ordering suicide because the refugees' matriarchal culture would lead them to respect a woman's opinions more than a man's.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nUingali took Thrawn, Thalias and Samakro to a [[Unidentified city (Rapacc)|city]] on Rapacc where the Magys' refugees had settled, hoping that Thalias could help resolve the Magys' people's dispute while sparing their lives. The refugees had assembled in what appeared to be the convocation hall of an abandoned school buildin, sitting in a pattern that Thrawn described as the \"tactics of desperation\" in which the strongest and most combat-ready sat closer to the edge, protecting the weaker, more vulnerable, and the leaders. Eventually, the Magys' protectors parted, opening enough room for one of their visitors to talk with their leader. Thrawn believed the Magys wished to talk to him, but when he attempted to converse with her, she insisted on only talking with Thalias, whom she could sense had \"touched the Beyond.\" Thalias and the Magys conversed in Taarja, and the Caregiver peruaded the Magys to visit her homeworld to see if there were any survivors before ordering her refugees' deaths. The Magys agreed, on the condition that she could take one of her refugees as a companion and witness. Thalias lacked the authority to make such promises, but did so anyway, seeing no other means of preventing a mass refugee suicide. By making commitments she lacked the authority to promise, Thalias committed insubordination. Nevertheless, Thrawn was pleased with her initiative, and ordered all crew of the ''Springhawk'' to act as if Thalias were a high-ranking officer whenever the Magys or her companion were present. That way, the illusion of Thalias' high rank would be maintained. Additionally, being a high officer would explain Thalias' periods of unavailability, which were in fact when she performed her caregiver duties for sky-walker Che'ri.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nAs the Chiss departed Rapacc, Samakro and Thrawn discussed sending an update to Csilla. Rapacc had no long-range [[communications triad]] for the Chiss visitors to use, and the ''Springhawk'' was out of range for ship-to-ship communications. Mid Captain Samakro insisted they first travel within comms range of the Ascendancy before going to the Magys' homeworld so they could update Ba'kif and Ar'alani with their status. However, Thrawn pointed out that time was short before the Magys would give the suicide, and if the data had been wrong or units converted incorrectly, the actual amount of time left may be even shorter than they thought. (Indeed, this was later shown to be the case.) As a result, Thrawn insisted they travel straight to the world the refugees had fled, to which the first officer commented he hoped that place would be worth the effort. Thrawn replied that he thought it would be, \"unfortunately.\"<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n====A mercy mission====\n{{Quotetrans|As soon as we locate your world, we will learn its condition.

I choose to nurture hope.|Thrawn and the Magys discuss her homeworld.|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nThe ''Springhawk'' ventured to the refugees' homeworld in an attempt to prevent their mass-suicide. Thrawn's mission to prevent the Magys' people from committing suicide took the Senior Captain far out of Chiss space while the plot of the warlike and mysterious Grysk species to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy unfolded.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nUpon sighting the Magys' homeworld, Thrawn asked the alien the planet's name. The Magys refused to share her world's name with an \"outsider,\" so Thrawn nicknamed that planet \"[[Sunrise]]\", choosing a name symbolic of his hope and optimism for her people's future. Thrawn then ordered the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} helm officer Azmordi to perform an [[Microjump|in-system jump]] to 40,000 [[kilometer]]s above Sunrise's equator.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nShortly after completing that jump, the ''Springhawk'' was [[First skirmish over Sunrise|attacked]] by unidentified forces affiliated with the Grysk Hegemony. Fifteen missile boats attacked in three groups of five, each in a rosette formation. The ''Springhawk'' managed to fend off the unidentified gunboats when a [[Unidentified Battle Dreadnought|''Battle Dreadnought''-class warship]] appeared from hyperspace. Fortunately, just as the ''Springhawk'' came under attack, Lakinda's ''Grayshrike'' appeared in the system, having tracked Thrawn down to deliver a message from Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk on Csilla. Together the two Chiss heavy cruisers managed to destroy five of the missile boats and drive the Dreadnought back, forcing it to retreat. Just before jumping to hyperspace, the Dreadnought destroyed the ten remaining gunboats that had fought on its own side to prevent the Chiss from analyzing them.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe Dreadnought had been guarding a [[Unidentified nyix freighter|small ship]] the size of a freighter that Thrawn, Samakro and Lakinda sought to identify; believing that identifying the freighter's purpose would provide clues to what enemy had attacked them and presumably instigated Sunrise's civil war. The Chiss did not know it at the time, but the freighter had been transporting the valuable industrial metal [[nyix]] off the world for the Grysk Hegemony.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nAfter observing the destruction on her homeworld, the Magys ordered her companion to commit suicide. Likewise, she attempted to kill herself, but Thrawn arrested her for causing the death of an alien on his vessel; remanding her in a [[hibernation chamber]] and placing it in Che'ri and Thalias' [[sky-walker suite]]. Lakinda also delivered the transmission Ja'fosk had sent for Thrawn, summoning the Mitth Senior Captain back to Csilla for orders and debriefing.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n====Wild pirate chase====\n<!-- Thrawn being sent by the Defense Hierarchy Council to hunt alleged Vagaari pirates until he rendezvoused with the ''Grayshrike'' at the Agbui mining world (Hoxim).

She and the whole Xodlak family have a lot of politics going on at the moment.|Thrawn and Mid Captain Samakro|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nFrom Sunrise, Thrawn took the ''Springhawk'' back to Csilla, where Thrawn and Samakro had several meetings. First, the captains met with the full Defense Hierarchy Council to debrief about the skirmish above Sunrise. Second, they were questioned by a select committee of the Syndicure about their mission. Finally, they met Ba'kif in his office for one of the Supreme General's infamous off-the-record meetings. Ba'kif told the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} top commanders of allegations of an alliance between the Paataatus and Vagaari pirates. Thrawn believed such an alliance to be impossible, as their overwhelming defeat by Picket Force Six the prior year should deter the Paataatus from attacking the Ascendancy for at least a Paataatus generation, given as 17&ndash;25 years. Ba'kif did not believe the rumors of the alliance either, but nevertheless assigned the ''Springhawk'' to investigate them, as the Syndicure and Council had for once agreed on a common goal.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nSamakro questioned the Ruling Families' ulterior motives to assign Thrawn more operations against alleged Vagaari pirates. The official reports of the Vagaari pirate operations had been thoroughly redacted. Samakro inferred that some of the Ruling Families believed they could profit by sending Thrawn against the Vagaari again, referring to the correct rumors that Thrawn had acquired valuable technology from Lesser Space in his prior engagements against Vagaari pirates. Supreme General Ba'kif did not confirm or deny such motivations, and Ba'kif's complete lack of a reaction confirmed the Mid Captain's suspicions. Thrawn was assigned the mission and created a search pattern to follow in pursuit of the pirates. He shared his search pattern with Ba'kif, Ar'alani, and Lakinda so they could locate him if needed.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nBefore departing, Thrawn asked the General whether the ''Grayshrike'' would be sent back to investigate Sunrise and the force that had attacked the Chiss there. Ba'kif responded that many Aristocra were weary of sending a major warship so far from the Ascendancy, but did not explicitly say the cruiser would not return to the Magys' planet. At the time, the ''Grayshrike'' was undergoing repairs at [[Csilla Blackdock Two]], further from the surface than any of Csilla's [[bluedock]] facilities. From that, Thrawn correctly inferred that Lakinda's cruiser would be assigned a [[Second skirmish over Sunrise|follow-up mission]] to Sunrise and would be joined by Ar'alani's ''Vigilant''. The ''Grayshrike'' would later receive orders to assist in Thrawn's search for pirates and the ''Springhawk'' would be informed by comms triad, but Thrawn would be too far out of communications range at the time to acknowledge receipt of that information.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n=====Old enemies; new friends=====\n<!-- Skirmish above Nettehi; ''Greater Good'' Chapter 13 -->\n{{Quotetrans|Prince Militaire, this is Senior Captain Thrawn.

After entering the system, the ''Springhawk'' scanned twenty Paataatus fighters, six [[Paataatus enhanced cruiser]]s and one [[Paataatus heavy frigate]] orbiting Nettehi, apparently performing a combat exercise. Not long after, the ''Springhawk'' received a transmission from a Paataatus identifying himself as [[Unidentified Prince Militaire|Prince Militaire]], and who informed the Chiss that they were trespassing in \"holy Paataatus space.\" Thrawn and Samakro reasoned that \"[[Prince Militaire]]\" must be a title for a civilian and military official in the Paataatus government, and noted that the Paataatus seemed more talkative than typical in past bouts of combat between the Chiss and the Paataatus. Thrawn replied by identifying himself as Senior Captain Thrawn and his ship as the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet warship ''Springhawk'', declaring their peaceful intent, and telling the Prince that he came with a question for the Paataatus. Rather than asking his quesiton immediately, Thrawn chose to observe the Paataatus' behavior towards the ''Springhawk'' to learn about their tactical situation.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe Senior and Mid Captains observed the Paataatus vessels change from a sentry configuration to a more defensive posture. Samakro thus reasoned that the Prince Militaire was aboard the frigate, and Thrawn pointed out a repositioning of the cruisers atypical of Paataatus tactics. Paataatus fighters gathered as though to attack. Thrawn surmised that Nikardun forces were aboard one of the six cruisers, monitoring the conversation between Thrawn and the Prince Militaire, and threatening the Prince's frigate if the Prince were to appeal for Chiss help against the Nikardun. Thrawn reiterated his peaceful intentions, but also promised to display the full might of the Chiss Ascendancy if the Paataatus' situation remained unchanged. The Prince asked whether Thrawn was threatening the Paataatus people, to which Thrawn replied by affirming his prioir words. The Prince Militaire made aggresive statements towards the Chiss, to which Thrawn replied steadfastly. A [[Skirmish above Nettehi|skirmish]] ensued, seeing the Paataatus ally with the Chiss to successfully liberate their homeworld.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe ''Springhawk'' and the Paataatus made a show of pretending to attack each other, keying their spectrum lasers to ionize the [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] profile. As a result, the crossfire consisted of brightly visible laser bursts easily seen across the vacuum of space, yet which inflicted minimal damage upon impact. Mid Captain Samakro dubbed this fangless show-of-force a \"[[light show]].\" Thrawn identified the nearest Paataatus enhanced cruiser aft of the frigate as the one carrying Nikardun forces and ordered his weapons officer Afpriuh to fire at it. At that moment, all the Chiss and Paataatus warships concentrated fire upon the Nikardun-controlled frigate, neutralizing its threat to either faction and destroying it.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThankful for Thrawn's assistance liberating their homeworld, the Paataatus asked Thrawn what his question had been and allowed the ''Springhawk'' to use their long-range communications triad to reach the Ascendancy. Thrawn's question to the Paataatus was whether they had any leads on recent Vagaari pirate activity, which they denied. Armed with new information about the presence and absence of Nikardun and Vagaari forces, Thrawn updated his search pattern and sent his modified plan to Naporar. Thrawn used their triad to send his message, in the Chiss language [[Cheunh]], to the Syndicure and Defense Hierarchy Council. The Senior Captain encrypted the message using his personal encryption key, leading Supreme General Ba'kif to ensure other recipients that it could be trusted to originate with Thrawn, rather than as a Paataatus trick.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nAs a result of the liberation of Nettehi, the Paataatus and the Chiss developed much better diplomatic relations,<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> despite their prior acrimony.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n=====A freighter attacked=====\n{{Quote|Fsir intends to lure us into range of something large and powerful, and must wait until we're ready to oblige him.''\"<br />\"''That doesn't sound good.

Eventually, the ''Springhawk'' encountered a [[Watith]] captain named [[Fsir]] who claimed his freighter ''[[Saltbarrel]]'' was under pursuit by Vagaari pirates. In fact, the freighter remotely controlled three [[Watith gunboat]]s which appeared to attack the ''Saltbarrel'' but did no real damage. Thrawn later commented to Caregiver Thalias and Mid Captain Samakro that pilots would have to have implausibly bad aim to do such little damage if they wished to harm the freighter.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe ''Springhawk'' destroyed the three attacking gunboats in an ensuing skirmish, after which Fsir told the Chiss that he knew the location of a Vagaari pirate base from which the gunboats had attacked. The Watith captain insisted on leading the ''Springhawk'' to the system where the alleged Vagaari base was located, rather than simply providing the system's location. Thrawn was skeptical of the Watith's motives and claims of being attacked and insisted on remaining in their current system long enough to examine the debris from the destroyed gunboats. Further, the Chiss Senior Captain insisted on boarding the ''Saltbarrel'' to examine the Watith crew's competencies. Fsir objected to Thrawn boarding, but Thrawn eased the Watith's concerns by allowing them to hide their computer systems, reminding him that the Chiss would not understand labels written in the Watith's [[writing]] system, and rationalizing the visit as \"payment\" for saving the Watith crew and cargo. Fsir relented and agreed, after which Thrawn boarded the ''Saltbarrel'' along with several [[Chiss warrior]]s acting as guards. Upon boarding, Thrawn counted 23 crew members including Fsir, as well as 20 consoles that he surmised were used to remotely pilot the gunboats.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThrawn suspected the Watith were laying a trap but nevertheless agreed to escort them to the supposed Vagaari base. In fact, because the Expansionary Defense Fleet's primary mission was to evaluate threats to the Chiss Ascendancy beyond their own borders, Thrawn viewed it is all the more important to spring the trap and learn about an enemy bold enough to stage a deliberate attack on a Chiss warship. The ''Saltbarrel'' did not have a navigator aboard, so the two ships had to make a [[jump-by-jump]] journey to their target system; making short hyperspace jumps of a few star systems at a time and stopping to recalibrate. The ''Grayshrike'' had been given Thrawn's search pattern and sent by Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk to assist the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} hunt for alleged Vagaari pirates. Once the ''Springhawk'' was in the last system before the one that allegedly hosted the Vagaari pirate base, Mid Captain [[Csap'ro'strob]] \"Apros\" of the ''Grayshrike'' successfully made contact with the ''Springhawk''. Thrawn filled Apros in on their status and coordinated with the Mid Captain to lie in wait in the shadow of the planet which purportedly housed the Vagaari base.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n=====Reversing the trap=====\n{{Quotetrans|They see us! Senior Captain Thrawn, they ''see'' us!''\u00bb<br />\u00ab''So they do. Unfortunately for them, they have nowhere to go.|Captain Fsir panicking at the sight of hostile gunboats and Thrawn's confident reply|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nOnce the ''Springhawk'' and ''Saltbarrel'' arrived in the destination system, twenty gunboats awaited and [[Skirmish against the Watith|attacked them]]. Two of the gunboats sped off toward the planet below, and Fsir cried out that they must be seeking reinforcements from a Vagaari base and preparing to sound an alert. The Watith captain then insisted the Vagaari base was an orbital weapons platform. With eighteen gunboats between the ''Springhawk'' and the fleeing fighters, Thrawn would have to fight through all eighteen before destroying those allegedly seeking reinforcements. Senior Commander Kharill, who had been smiling, now chuckled.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThrawn ordered weapons officer Afpriuh to target the two closest gunboats with the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} spectrum lasers, and commanded Kharill to prepare a full spread of ionizing plasma spheres on all but the leading two gunboats. Kharill would supervise [[plasma sphere specialist]] [[Laknym]]'s aim and targetting, and they were not to fire the spheres until Thrawn gave the command. Sky-walker Che'ri, located in [[secondary command]], shuddered at the irregular order; recognizing that a combination of spectrum lasers, plasma spheres, and breacher missiles was typically required to destroy an enemy ship; even one as small as a gunboat. Afpriuh's lasers quickly destroyed the two leading gunboats, and their debris occluded the remaining gunboats' view of the ''Springhawk'' and the plasma spheres it launched. Nevertheless, the gunboats evaded the spheres' trajectories almost instantly, which would not have been possible for organic pilots aboard to do. As a result, the Chiss had proven the gunboats were operated remotely. Two of the sixteen gunboats were hit by glancing blows and rendered disabled but still intact, leaving fourteen gunboats operational on the plane of battle, plus the two heading toward the planet.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nAt that point, Thrawn had proven the Watith's culpability for the gunboats to his officers' satisfaction, and he ordered Laknym to fire plasma spheres to disable the ''Saltbarrel''. At the same time, Thrawn ordered his [[Communications Officer|communications officer]] [[Brisch]] to signal the ''Grayshrike'' to make its presence known. Mid Captain Apros ordered the unidentified gunboats to stand down or be destroyed, and the ''Saltbarrel'' tried to evade Laknym's sphere barrage to no avail. The ionizing energy from the plasma spheres disabled the Watith freighter's thrusters, and immediately caused not only the freighter but also the eighteen remaining gunboats to drift in space along their current vectors&mdash;including the two gunboats headed toward the planet. Thrawn ordered the officers of the ''Springhawk'' and ''Grayshrike'' to collect the ''Saltbarrel'' and the fourteen remaining Watith gunboats that were neither flickered nor heading toward the planet. Thrawn arrested the Watith crew and seized their assets. The Watith later confessed they had been hired to distract Thrawn from the internal events of the Ascendancy.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> Their employer, though not revealed to Thrawn at that time, was the Grysk Hegemony agent Jixtus.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nThe mood in the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} bridge and secondary command lightened after the Chiss victory over the Watith, but Thrawn warned his officers and warriors that the day may not be over yet. Thrawn asked Apros whether the Watith had been correct in their assertion of an orbital Vagaari pirate base in the planetary shadow. Apros confirmed that no Vagaari base, or indeed anything else, had been present on the far side of the planet, where his ''Grayshrike'' had been hidden for the beginning of the skirmish. Thrawn declared happily that, in that case, the day was indeed over, but was cut off by Apros raising what he called an \"urgent\" matter. Thrawn invited Apros to board the ''Springhawk'' and asked the ''Grayshrike''{{'s}} personnel's help gathering the Watith gunboats.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n====Stopping a war before it started====\n=====Alien jewelry=====\n{{Quotetrans|When all are gone, we have no future but to touch the Beyond.

Thrawn was extremely unsettled by this news, as he knew Lakinda to be a devoted and steadfast officer. The Senior Captain asked whether Apros knew anything about the circumstances of the emergency summons, but the ''Grayshrike''{{'s}} Mid Captain did not. Apros had tried to dissuade Lakinda from leaving her post, but she left promptly upon learning of the order and accompanied a Xodlak hyperdrive technician named [[Lakwurn]] to Celwis. Thrawn thus learned that whoever had declared the Xodlak emergency on Celwis must have wanted all military personnel of the Xodlak family to assemble, regardless of rank or position. Apros further revealed the results of his inquiry into the state of Celwis, describing two partially-crewed [[Xodlak cruiser|light cruisers]] and an un-crewed [[Chiss frigate|reserve frigate]] that the Xodlak had among their [[Chiss family#Family fleets|fleet]] at Celwis. The Mid Captain feared that the Xodlak might be setting up for a battle, but neither he nor the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} commanders knew who they might intend to fight.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nApros further informed the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} senior officers that they had received two additional encrypted transmissions issuing family emergency summons for members of two other [[Great Families]] of the Ascendancy. Defense Fleet personnel of the [[Erighal family]] were to assemble at the planet [[Copero]], and those of the [[Pommrio family]] were to assemble at [[Sarvchi]]. Like Celwis, Copero and Sarvchi were located in the Ascendancy's Southeastern region. The ''Grayshrike''{{'s}} weapons officer [[Erighal'ok'sumf]] \"Ghaloksu\" had informed Apros of the Erighal summons during a rest period the ''Grayshrike'' took for the benefit of its sky-walker [[Bet'nih]]. Ghaloksu had not requested leave for the summons, and Apros would not have granted it anyway as the ''Grayshrike'' was by then nearly to the alleged Vagaari base system and therefore in an \"imminent threat situation.\"<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThrawn noted that the party's current location was to the Southeast zenith of the Ascendancy's borders, near Celwis, Copero, and Sarvchi. He insisted on helping resolve whatever trouble was brewing. The Chiss heavy cruisers were to collect fourteen Watith gunboats and the ''Saltbarrel'', with the ''Grayshrike'' towing nine gunboats and the ''Springhawk'' hauling the other five as well as the Watith freighter. Samakro pointed out that it sounded like the Expansionary Defense Fleet had not been \"invited\" to whatever the three families might be up to, but the Mitth Senior Captain did not care. Before departing to help collect the gunboats, Apros remembered that he had come aboard the ''Springhawk'' to hand Thrawn a [[nyix brooch]]. He explained that those brooches had caused a great deal of \"official interest\" on Celwis, and a [[Xodlak'phr'ooa|Xodlak rancher]] on Celwis had acquired one. The rancher sent it to his cousin [[Lakbulbup]], an employee of the Expansionary Defense Fleet on Naporar. Lakbulbup had heard of Thrawn's brilliance at analyzing alien art and culture and insisted on sending the brooch to Thrawn. The rancher's cousin had then given the brooch to Lakwurn, a Xodlak junior officer on the ''Grayshrike'', when that ship docked at Naporar for repairs and provisions, and Lakwurn was to give it to Senior Captain Lakinda to give to Thrawn. However, because Lakwurn and Lakinda had taken leave to answer the Xodlak family emergency on Celwis, Lakinda entrusted the brooch to Apros to give to Thrawn. Apros relayed this information to the Mitth Senior Captain before departing.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nAfter the ''Grayshrike''{{'s}} Mid Captain returned to his ship, Samakro commented that each of the three Great Families involved were allied with a mutually-rivaled Ruling Family. Thrawn had not known that, but Samakro explained that the Xodlak were allied with the Irizi family, the Erighal with the [[Dasklo family]], and the Pommrio with the [[Plikh family]]. Tensions were already high between the Irizi, Dasklo, and Plikh families, to the degree that any altercation involving their allied Great Families would cause major discord in the Syndicure and throughout the Ascendancy. Samakro further commented derisively that he wished Apros could have been more helpful, but Thrawn saw the brooch as far more useful than his first officer did.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nA note affixed to the brooch explained its origin from aliens known as the Agbui who claimed to be cultural nomads. Thrawn inserted the note into his questis to learn about the brooch's history. The Senior Captain saw artistic similarities between the clothing of the Magys and the [[metal]] threads of the brooch Apros had just given him. At the time, the Magys was [[Prison|imprisoned]] in a hibernation chamber in the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} sky-walker suite, and Thrawn resolved to awaken her to inquire about the brooch. He and Samakro entered Thalias' and Che'ri's suite after making sure the sky-walker was fast asleep, and proceeded to initiate the end of the Magys' hibernation. While the machine deactivated, the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} captains filled Thalias in on the details of the brooch and the family emergencies. Thalias asked whether the Agbui might be some of the Magys' people, which Thrawn quickly assured was not the case. However, he could see artistically similarities between the brooch and the Magys' clothing and insisted that Thalias and Samakro could also see the relation. (In fact, neither could.)<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe Magys awoke furious, accusing the Senior Captain of betraying her people by denying her the \"right and weight of leadership.\" She insisted that her people were gone and her remnant had no right of \"lingering survival,\" and they must die to touch the Beyond. Thrawn tried in vain to reason with the Magys, but she insisted that she would commit suicide then and her people would follow later. Abruptly, Caregiver Thalias interjected, taking the brooch from Thrawn's hands and showing it to the Magys. The brooch was clean and beautiful, unblemished by the stains of war or degradation, suggesting its recent manufacture and distribution. The Magys instantly ceased her angry accusations and gained a new resolve. She explained that the brooch had undoubtedly come from her world of Sunrise, and only the [[artisan]]s of the [[Southern Mountains]] could craft such a beautiful trinket from metal wires. She had feared them all dead, as she feared of the rest of her planet's population, but Thalias and the brooch gave her new hope.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe Magys demanded that Thrawn take her to Sunrise immediately to reunite with her people. Thrawn promised he would do so soon, but she must wait a little longer. He explained that, if anyone outside the sky-walker suite learned that she was still alive and aboard, his superiors would call him back home to investigate his actions and study her, thus delaying her reunion and repatriation. The Magys was ready to passionately argue the point, but acquiesced to Thrawn's rationale after glancing in the direction where Che'ri lie asleep&mdash;a fellow Force-sensitive. The Magys then returned to stasis.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThalias apologized for her \"severely disrespectful\" behavior towards Thrawn in that exchange, but the Senior Captain did not mind. He reassured the caregiver that he cared far more about results than etiquette, and her actions were very productive. Thrawn was neither angry nor annoyed, but rather relaxed. He turned to Samakro to ask his executive officer's thoughts on the situation. The Mid Captain replied by questioning how the Agbui could possibly benefit from stealing jewelry from the Magys' people and passing it off as their own. Thrawn insisted they find out by asking the one person who might know: Senior Captain Lakinda.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n=====Coordinating with Lakinda=====\n{{Dialogue|Lakinda|What the ''hell'' is going on?|Thrawn|They're scamming you.

They then created the illusion they were mining the metal from an entirely different world.|attr=Senior Captains Lakinda and Thrawn and Mid Captain Apros realize someone sought to draw the Chiss into a civil war.|src=Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nThrawn, Samakro, and Apros called Senior Captain Lakinda, eventually reaching her on a repositioning stop of her jump-by-jump journey for her family. The calling officers informed Lakinda that they both had information for her and required information from her. Lakinda initially refused to disclose the details of her Xodlak family mission. Thrawn and Apros informed her that the Pommrio and Erighal families appeared to be gathering for unknown but similar purposes in locations close to Celwis, raising Lakinda's alertness, but not enough for her to change her mind and disclose her mission parameters. Apros then insisted he had \"one last question\" for the Xodlak captain: whether her mission had anything to do with \"alien jewelry.\" Thrawn and Apros explained the brooches' origins, both supposed (from the Agbui) and true (stolen from Sunrise), and Lakinda asked whether merely the jewelry's manufacture had originated on Sunrise or if its metal had as well. She told her colleagues the question was \"vitally\" important because one of the metals in the brooch was nyix, a valuable industrial metal used to fortify the hulls of warships.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe officers explained that the Agbui were scamming the Xodlak, and most likely the Pommrio and Erighal families as well. Lakinda informed the calling officers that she was in command of the Xodlak frigate ''[[Midsummer]]'' and light cruiser ''[[Apogee]]'' to claim the supposed Agbui mining world of [[Hoxim]] for the Xodlak family. The Agbui presented themselves as having such an abundance of nyix that they could waste it on cheap jewelry, and had even set up a [[Unidentified settlement (Agbui)|fake mining settlement]] on Hoxim to convince family officials such as Senior Aide [[Xodlak'ji'iprip]] of their mineral riches. The plot to incite a Chiss civil war clicked in Lakinda's mind, and she explained that the Agbui's goal was for three Great Families to fight to the death over a \"worthless rock.\" To Lakinda's chagrin, Thrawn declared the Agbui's coordinated operation \"exquisitely planned and timed.\" She told him to forget the \"artistic beauty\" of their plot and insisted on warning Csilla. However, Apros pointed out they were far out of range to hail the capital planet, and that even if they could, reinforcements from Csilla or Naporar could not arrive in time to prevent a battle between the families' task forces. Thrawn then asked Lakinda how much her officers knew about their mission, and she replied that they knew nothing as she was ordered not to disclose the details until they arrive. Thrawn was pleased to hear that, as it bought them time to prepare.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThrawn came up with a plan by which the ''Springhawk'', ''Grayshrike'', and Lakinda (secretly) would defuse the tense situation bound to occur between the Xodlak, Pommrio, and Erighal families. Those families, set to engage one-another in battle, would find the ''Springhawk'' \"under attack\" by unknown gunboats. The family fleets, crewed by Expansionary Defense Fleet officers and warriors, would be loyal to the Ascendancy first and each of their families second. In Thrawn's plan, they would form an alliance to destroy the gunboats attacking Thrawn's \"damaged\" cruiser and all receive praise and accolades. The ''Springhawk'' and ''Grayshrike'' would arrive before any of the three family fleets, and Lakinda would accelerate her journey to beat the Pommrio and Erighal task forces to Hoxim.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nBoth Mid Captain Samakro and Senior Captain Lakinda thought Thrawn's plan was crazy, but neither could come up with a better plan in time for the coming showdown. Lakinda insisted that the mission to prevent a Chiss civil war had the utmost precedence, and that if that required destroying her ships, to consider her life expendable. Apros, her first officer, objected, but she told him she would not hear any arguments. Thrawn, politically oblivious, asserted that he was not going to offer one. Nonetheless, he promised they would do everything they could to prevent a need for such sacrifice.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n=====The battle at Hoxim=====\n<!-- Basically, Chapters 24 and 25 of ''Greater Good'' -->\n{{Quote|Mid Captain Samakro, are you ready?''\"<br />\"''We're ready, sir. Officers and warriors: Go.''\"<br />\"''Make it look good. Remember, the ''Springhawk'' is in serious trouble.|Thrawn gives Samakro the order to initiate \"hostilities.\"|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nThrawn's ''Springhawk'' and Apros' ''Grayshrike'' reached position at Hoxim well before the [[Task Force Xodlak|Xodlak]], [[Pommrio fleet|Pommrio]], and [[Expeditionary Force Alpha|Erighal]] family task forces. The ''Springhawk'' was positioned on the far side of the planet from where the family task forces would arrive, where it would come under apparent attack by the fourteen Watith gunboats. The cruiser's electrostatic barriers would be down, its lights would flicker, and its thursters would only fire intermittently; all to make the ''Springhawk'' appear in distress. The arrival of the quarreling Great Family forces would therefore be seen as a reprieve, and they could thus [[Hoxim incident|\"rescue\" Thrawn's warship and crew]] from an \"alien attack.\" Thrawn's rationale for the plan was that the task forces were crewed by officers and warriors of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet whose oaths to the Ascendancy would supersede their need to bring glory to their individual families when they saw a fellow Chiss warship in peril.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nFourteen officers and warriors were chosen from among the crew of the ''Springhawk'' to remotely operate the captured Watith gunboats from their consoles aboard the ''Saltbarrel''. Each of those fourteen was a member of the Xodlak, Pommrio, or Erighal families; chosen because each Great Family required its Defense Force personnel to be familiar with the layout and operations of the ships of their family fleets. For example, a Xodlak serving in the Chiss Defense Force would know the strengths and weaknesses of a Xodlak cruiser better than anyone else; and would thus know how to target one with a \"maximum of ferocity but a minimum of actual damage.\" Only ''Springhawk'' crewmembers were chosen as operators; not out of favoritism or seniority over the crew of the ''Grayshrike'', but merely because the Watith freighter's remote piloting consoles were aboard the ''Saltbarrel'' which was itself moored to the ''Springhawk''. The two cruisers had spent several days in hyperspace while traveling to Hoxim, making the Saltbarrel and gunboats only accessible to the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} crew during much of the journey. The cruisers' engineers and technicians had tried but failed to move or replicate the Watith consoles aboard their warships, and thus the pilots had to control their gunboats from aboard the ''Saltbarrel''.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nIn the course of the journey, Mid Captain Samakro oversaw hours of remote combat training simulations aboard the ''Saltbarrel''. One of the officers chosen to pilot a Watith gunboat was plasma sphere specialist Laknym, a member of the Xodlak family. In the hours leading up to the coming battle, Laknym expressed misgivings about being asked to fire upon the vessels of his own family. Samakro gave Laknym an impromptu pep talk about the solidity of Thrawn's plan, reminding the lieutenant commander that he had volunteered for the assignment and as a Xodlak, he knew how to target Xodlak vessels without inflicting any serious damage. Laknym understood the reasoning but wondered whether Thrawn might have a political motivation for such a task. Senior Captain Thrawn was a member of the Mitth family, which was rivaled against the Irizi family. The Irizi were allies of Laknym's Xodlak family, so concerns of [[Chiss family#Family politics|family politics]] might reasonably lead Thrawn to want to embarrass the Xodlak. Samakro quickly shot Laknym's worries down, insisting that he had never met anyone as \"utterly incompetent\" at politics as Senior Captain Thrawn. The Mid Captain explained that when Thrawn came up with a plan, it was strictly military; nothing more and nothing less. He insisted that the plan would work, allaying the sphere specialist's fears and, to his surprise, even convincing himself that Thrawn's plan was good.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nUpon the arrival of the Great Families' task forces, sensor officer Dalvu informed the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} bridge crew of their arrivals and positions. The Xodlak, Erighal, and Pommrio family task forces were on the verge of attacking one-another to claim the planet below when they noticed the ''Springhawk'' derelict and imperiled just beyond the curve of the planet. Senior Captain Lakinda convinced the three families' forces to form a united front to defend the ''Springhawk''. Meanwhile, Thrawn ordered the gunboat operators to put on a convincing performance, appearing to attack with full force while minimizing damage inflicted on the Great Families' warships. Furthermore, the gunboats could not be taken out too quickly or too easily, as enough gunboats had to hold out for long enough for the ''Grayshrike'' to appear, come to the apparent rescue, and bring the battle to a close. The combined Xodlak, Pommrio, and Erighal forces amounted to one frigate, two light cruisers, and five patrol ships. The fourteen gunboats would presumably outmatch such a strike force, making the smart tactical move for each Chiss family to retreat and return with reinforcements. Thrawn's plan counted on each family's tenacious and even reckless desire to secure the supposed \"nyix mine\" for their family overruling their self-preservation, making them stay and fight a stronger force. Indeed, the families refused to retreat and regroup, deciding to stand and fight the Watith gunboats.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nControlled from the ''Saltbarrel'', the gunboats attacked the families' ships with apparent might but in fact choosing their targets to minimize damage. They targeted empty hull sections, targeting sensors, and other non-critical systems that could be repaired or circumvented with skilled crewers' manual aim. Thrawn's plan went successfully until the family task forces destroyed six of the gunboats, reducing the original fourteen gunboats to eight. At that point, Senior Captain Lakinda noticed a potentially fatal flaw she believed Thrawn would miss due to his ignorance regarding family politics. Each family task force had been sent to Hoxim to claim the world's supposedly abundant nyix mines. However, the mines were a ruse and Hoxim was mineralogically useless to the Chiss. Lakinda reasoned that the three Great Families would surely discover that after rescuing the ''Springhawk'', and at that point, the families would look for someone to blame for misleading them and wasting their time. As a result, Lakinda believed that inter-family tensions would become nearly as bad as if the three task forces had actually attacked each other. As a result, she made an excuse to leave the ''Midsummer''{{'s}} bridge to launch a tight-beam communication to warn Thrawn about the flaw in his plan. Lakinda warned the Mitth captain that the Agbui \"mining\" settlement on Hoxim must be destroyed in the battle. She suggested that someone would have to remain aboard the ''Saltbarrel'' to crash it into the \"mine\", which would cost that person's life. Thrawn could not reply to Lakinda even on a tight-beam channel without risking another of the family ships intercepting his reply. After sending her warning to the ''Springhawk'', Lakinda's officers mutinied, releaving her of command and restricting her to quarters pending an investigation of her alleged crimes and offenses against the Xodlak family. Lakinda protested that the Mitth were not their family's enemy, but her first officer countered that the Mitth were not their ally either. Lakinda worried that Thrawn had required her to remain in command to make changes to the battle plan as needed, and now he would not even know that she had been usurped until the battle had ended.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nSilence permeated the ''Saltbarrel'' as the remote gunboat operators took in Lakinda's implication that one of them must sacrifice their life to destroy the fake Agbui mine with the Watith freighter. The ''Springhawk''{{'s}} engineers had been unable to manufacture a remote-piloting system to control the ''Saltbarrel'' and had likewise failed to move the freighter's remote consoles aboard the ''Springhawk''. Laknym volunteered to sacrifice himself to crash the freighter into the mine while Samakro tried to find alternatives to loss of life. Thrawn messaged the ''Saltbarrel'' over the comm, saying Lakinda had been right that that the ''Saltbarrel'' must ''appear'' to be piloted. Laknym told his commander he understood, his throat tightening in tension as he accepted his fate, but no regret showed in the plasma sphere specialist's face or eyes. Thrawn disagreed, emphasizing the need for appearing to be piloted. Instead, the Senior Captain ordered Laknym to save him a gunboat for his personal use and ordered the people aboard the ''Saltbarrel'' to prepare to evacuate to the ''Springhawk'' upon his command.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nAdapting to Lakinda's warning, Thrawn urgently summoned caregiver Thalias and sky-walker Che'ri to the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} bridge. When they arrived, Thrawn was in communication with the first officer of the ''Midsummer'' who had mutinied against Lakinda. Thrawn told the officer that the ''Springhawk'' received a transmission from Lakinda but had been unable to open it because they had been boarded by attackers, from whom they and only just regained control. (Thrawn's statement to the mutinous officer was a lie). He asked the officer to allow Lakinda to re-send her message, but the officer refused. At that moment, Thrawn ordered comms officer Brisch to signal the ''Grayshrike'' to make its appearance. Five gunboats remained as Apros' heavy cruiser appeared, causing the remaining gunboats to flee. Prior to the ''Grayshrike''{{'s}} arrival, the gunboats fleeing would have appeared uncharacteristically cowardly and suspicious to the family task forces. However, the arrival of a Chiss heavy cruiser sufficiently upset the balance of power in the battle to mitigate any such suspicion. The ''Grayshrike'' eliminated three of the five gunboats as they passed, leaving two intact. At that moment, Samakro informed the bridge crew that the ''Saltbarrel'' had been evacuated and all its personnel were aboard the Springhawk. The Mid Captain released the freighter, unmooring it from the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} underside.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThrawn ordered weapons officer Afpriuh to target specific sections on and just off the freighter in a pattern of near-misses, both to give the appearance that the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} power had just been restored and its targeting systems remained less than fully functional and to cause the freighter's thrusters to release compressed gas to make it appear powered on and under command. Thrawn explained to his bridge crew that the three rival families were recording the battle, and they must convince anyone who would view the footage in the future that the skirmish's events could not possibly have been \"engineered\" by the ''Springhawk''. As such, he would set the freighter and two gunboats to collide and required Che'ri's gift of Third Sight to ensure they would crash into and destroy the Agbui mine below. Thrawn would have Afpriuh operate a tractor beam to slightly change the ''Saltbarrel''{{'s}} trajectory to make it hit the mine; guided by Che'ri's precognition to ensure the wreckage would destroy the target. The Mitth Senior Captain told his sky-walker that they would only have one shot, as the recorded footage would correctly identify additional attempts as tractor connections.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nChe'ri was to use her precognition to watch the tactical display several seconds in the future. Afpriuh operated the tractor beam, inactive and set to low power. If Che'ri foresaw the freighter making a certain yaw turn, she would tap Afpriuh's hand to signal the weapons officer to set the tractor beam's power to full and then activate it. Thereby, they would ensure the wreckage would have momentum with a vector that would destroy the Agbui settlement. Thalias objected on the grounds that Third Sight allowed Che'ri to prevent events from occurring, such as crashing into a star while in hyperspace. In contrast, Thrawn's current plan required Che'ri to foresee that an event would not occurr and then act to make it happen anyway. Thrawn reasoned that it should work as long as Che'ri was not directly influencing the event and as long as Afpriuh remained in control. Che'ri thought her task was like what she did all the time in the course of her duties as navigator, but Thalias continued to object. The caregiver asked what would happen if Che'ri did not perform Thrawn's task, to which the Senior Captain replied perhaps nothing, but perhaps \"serious trouble among the families.\" Thrawn said Che'ri would not have to do it if she felt uncomfortable, but the girl replied that she had not believed she could fly until Thrawn taught her and that if he believed in her, she could do anything. The girl then agreed to guide Afpriuh's hands.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThrawn had not informed Che'ri or Thalias that they were attempting to prevent a civil war, but Thalias suspected based on the tension on the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} bridge that Thrawn had understated the consequences of Che'ri declining the task. Che'ri waited until the right moment when she signaled Apros to fire the tractor beam to full. The ''Saltbarrel'' collided with the gunboats and exploded, and Dalvu confirmed that their combined vector would hit and destroy the mine. Che'ri did not respond for several moments after that, and Thrawn ordered her to undergo a full medical examination when she came to. Che'ri objected, as she and Thalias had been playing a game in their suite before Thrawn summoned them to the bridge. Thalias insisted their game would keep, before privately reflecting that Thrawn was playing a game too. Unlike her and Che'ri, Thalias doubted Thrawn's game had ended.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n====Aftermath of Hoxim====\n{{Quote|Would it help if I promised anything you say would be treated as confidential?''\"<br />\"''I'm sorry, Supreme General.

You'll have to ask Senior Captain Thrawn.|Supreme General Ba'kif tried to get Mid Captain Samakro to explain recent events, but the Mid Captain refused on the grounds of standing confidentiality orders on operations involving sky-walkers.|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nFollowing the skirmish above Hoxim, Supreme General Ba'kif was skeptical of the official explanation that had been offered. The Xodlak, Pommrio, and Erighal task forces had all shared the same story, as had the crews of the ''Grayshrike'' and the ''Springhawk''. According to their testimony, the ''Springhawk'' had been attacked, disabled, and boarded by alien enemies. The ''Grayshrike'' and family task forces had arrived at an opportune time to save Thrawn's cruiser from destruction, and the boarders had been found dead in the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} brig. The testimony continued that the boarders had been victims of small doomsday devices that their unknown employer had planted inside their bodies. An enemy freighter tried to escape but came into the path of the last two surviving gunboats; crashing, exploding, and falling to the planet below.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe Erighal, Pommrio, and Xodlak families all lionized Mid Captain Apros for his heroism, and the [[Csap family]] captain publicly and enthusiastically thanked the families for their timely arrival to rescue the ''Springhawk''. In turn, the families reminded everyone that they were all Chiss first and Xoldak, Erighal, or Pommrio second. However, no explanation had been offered for why the three families' defense ships had been so far out of the Chiss Ascendancy's territory to begin with.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe General debriefed Mid Captain Samakro and others present for the battle, seeking to understand what had truly happened. Samakro invoked secrecy protocols for missions involving Chiss sky-walkers; citing Che'ri's presence and actions on the mission as a reason he could not disclose details of the events to Ba'kif. Only Senior Captain Thrawn could choose whether to release the seal of secrecy on those events, and Ba'kif doubted he would ever learn the full truth. Under normal circumstances, the Supreme General would summon Thrawn to his office to demand the truth of the events above Hoxim. However, the Great Families' allied ruling families&mdash;the Irizi, Dasklo, and Plikh&mdash;actively tried to block Ba'kif from making an inquiry into events. Ba'kif was extremely puzzled at the turn of events, as those families were not friendly to Thrawn's Mitth family and many of their Syndics disliked the Mitth senior captain to the point of hatred.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThe Supreme General tried in vein to coax Samakro into divulging the events of the skirmish. However, Samakro cited standing orders he must obey, telling the general he would have to ask Senior Captain Thrawn directly. Ba'kif could tell that Samakro did not like his commanding officer, and Samakro asked for permission to speak freely. Upon being granted that permission, the Ufsa family mid captain launched into a short tirade denouncing what he perceived as Thrawn's personality flaws. However, Samakro then told the general that none of that mattered, as Thrawn was an excellent commander and strategist. Whatever the mid captain thought of Thrawn personally, he would follow him and his orders to the best of his ability. As Samakro departed, Ba'kif thought to himself that he would seek out the full truth of the Hoxim skirmish once the Syndicure became distracted by other matters. The involvement of the Expansionary Defense Fleet at Hoxim meant the Defense Hierarchy Council had the right to investigate the Agbui and their nyix jewelry, even if the families involved disliked it.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nShortly after the skirmish of Hoxim, Patriarch Thooraki died. The [[Patriel]]s of the Mitth family chose Syndic Prime Thurfian as his successor.

Following the Hoxim incident, Thrawn took the ''Springhawk'' to the [[Zyzek system]], a trading hub Southeast of the Ascendancy where he believed the Watith crew of the ''Saltbarrel'' had been hired. Thrawn announced in Minnisiat that he sought to return his 23 Watith prisoners to any Watith that may be present in the system. In truth, Fsir's crew had all died,<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" /> as the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} officers had testified to Supreme General Ba'kif,<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> but Thrawn did not announce that. He sought information on who may have hired the Watith, and chose the Zyzek system based on artistic patterns he had seen aboard the ''Saltbarrel''.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nAt [[Zyzek]], the ''Springhawk'' encountered a [[Kilji]] named [[Nakirre]], the [[generalirius]] and leader of the [[Kilji Illumine]]. Unbeknownst to Thrawn at the time, the Grysk Hegemony agent Jixtus was aboard Nakirre's flagship [[Kilji war cruiser]] ''Whetstone'' and advising the generalirius. After a conversation with Nakirre regarding the [[Kilji path]], ancient Chiss philosophy, and the Watith; Thrawn departed to the planet [[Sposia]] to deliver an artifact he had acquired from the ''Saltbarrel'': a lattice system that enabled the Watith crew to detect when a vessel would emerge from hyperspace. Thrawn and Samakro delievered the artifact the [[Universal Analysis Group]] (\"UAG\"), a secretive Chiss military research project based on Sposia<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" /> largely overseen by the Great and former Ruling [[Stybla family]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> Previously, Thrawn had presented the UAG with the gravity well projector he had acquired from the Vagaari pirate operations and the \"Republic energy shield\" he had siezed from the Separatist base on Mokivj. The UAG had not successfully reverse-engineered either of those devices yet, but Thrawn had nevertheless gained renown in the Ascendancy's upper echelons for acquiring valuable alien technology of interest to the Chiss Defense Force.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\nThrawn and Samakro deposited the Watith lattice artifact at the UAG's [[Vault Four]] on Sposia, where they met with Stybla Patriarch [[Stybla'mi'ovodo]] \"Lamiov\" and Supreme General Ba'kif. The military officials and the Stybla Patriarch discussed the artifact and its potential for defense operations. The ''Springhawk'' was then sent to return to Csilla for repairs and a debriefing on the Hoxim debacle.

Hiding on the edge of the encampment, Thrawn removed the [[sturm dowel]]s from his stolen blaster power packs and strapped them to the backs of small nocturnal creatures as improvised explosives. Drawn by the smell of the fermented [[Berry|berries]] in the makeshift scarecrow Thrawn had made of the pilot's flight suit, the creatures ran into the Imperial encampment, exploding and causing chaos within the base.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nIn response to the explosive berry mayhem, Captain Parck ordered another group of V-Wings to perform a grid search for the as-yet unknown assailant. Thrawn, realizing he would need to replace his stolen comm before they jammed it, managed to crash another V-Wing and swapped his stolen comm with the pilot's. Thrawn also stole the pilot's blaster, power packs, and concussion grenades, but did not remove the pilot's corpse from his flight suit. When Barris discovered that Thrawn had stolen the first pilot's comm, he ordered that particular comm shut down. Barris did not, however, discover that Thrawn had swapped the first stolen comm with the second pilot's, so Thrawn was still able to eavesdrop on Imperial communications.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:CaptiveThrawn.png|thumb|right|200px|Thrawn captured by Imperials]]\nDue to the chaos raining down on the Imperial forces, Colonel Barris ordered [[Imperial Navy Trooper]]s to join the search.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Imperial Navy Troopers wore a distinctive black helmet that showed the trooper's face,<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref> whereas Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s did not. Because Thrawn was a Chiss with blue skin and red [[eye]]s, armor or uniforms that showed his face would not be a suitable disguise to infiltrate the human forces of the Galactic Empire.<ref name=\"Thrawn comic 1\">[[Thrawn 1|''Thrawn'' 1]]</ref> Thrawn attacked the navy troopers with explosives throughout the night, hoping to goad the Imperials into sending stormtroopers into the forest to investigate. Once the stormtroopers were sent out in search of Thrawn, he used another explosive to dispatch [[Unidentified clone trooper (Thrawn)|one of the soldiers]] in order to study the [[stormtrooper armor]], while simultaneously [[Signal jammer|jamming]] the Imperials' comms in order to distract from the sound of the explosion.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Thrawn donned the [[phase II clone trooper armor]] of the [[Cloning|clone]] trooper he incapacitated.<ref name=\"Thrawn comic 1\" />\n\nAfter the screeching of the comms subsided, Barris decided that he had had enough of Thrawn's attacks and took Thrawn's hut aboard the ''Strikefast'' to study it onboard. While the UA protocols required Imperials to study possible first-contact with alien species, they did not explicitly require the studies to take place at the location of possible contact. As such, Barris justified taking Thrawn's makeshift shelter aboard the ''Strikefast''. Knowing the time had come for him to return to his camp, Thrawn silently killed another stormtrooper. Filling the stormtrooper's armor with explosives, Thrawn snuck the [[armor]] into the encampment and propped it up by the transport with sticks. While the Imperials were distracted by the exploding armor, Thrawn hid in a [[power generator]] casing from his camp. The casing was then loaded into a transport and taken, with the rest of Thrawn's hut and crates, to the ''Strikefast.''<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> While hiding in the power generator casing, the Chiss continued to wear the [[clone trooper armor]] he took from the trooper he neutralized.<ref name=\"Thrawn comic 1\" />\n\nOnce Thrawn was aboard the ''Strikefast'', he spent two [[standard hour]]s waiting in the casing before leaving his hiding place. Moving swiftly, but not so swiftly that he would not be seen, Thrawn crossed the [[hangar]] and boarded a [[Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle|''Zeta''-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle]]. When Parck sent troopers to intercept him, Thrawn allowed himself to be captured without resistance. Once he had willingly surrendered, Thrawn was brought before Parck and Barris. The senior officers asked Cadet Vanto to serve as a [[translator]] due to Vanto's fluency in Sy Bisti. Among all the Imperials, only Eli Vanto recognized Thrawn as a Chiss, and mentioned his the legends of the Chiss he had heard growing up on Lysatra. The captive Mitth'raw'nuruodo heard Vanto say the word \"Chiss\" and became keenly interested in what the human cadet had heard of his species.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nParck asked whether Thrawn spoke Basic or Sy Bisti, to which Thrawn replied that he knew a fair bit of Basic but was far more comfortable with Sy Bisti. Parck replied that the Chiss captive's comfort was not the issue at hand, and they would converse in Basic. Vanto served as Thrawn's translator for the remainder of the conversation, where Thrawn introduced himself as Mitth'raw'nuruodo, but said it would be easier for his human captors to call him by his core name \"Thrawn.\" He then told the Imperials of his exile and how he had crashed the V-Wings, attacked the camp unseen, and infiltrated the ''Strikefast''. Thrawn said he had to return to his native people, who faced untold dangers and needed him. Parck asked why Thrawn had been exiled if his people needed him so, questioning whether the Chiss leaders disagreed with Thrawn about Threats to their people. Thrawn said they agreed regarding the threats to the Chiss Ascendancy, but disagreed on a subject which he did not know the word for in Basic. Thrawn relayed it as \"''ezeboli hlusalu''\" in Sy Bisti, which Vanto gulped and translated as \"preemptive strikes.\" The conversation impressed Parck, to the point that he decided to present Thrawn to Emperor Palpatine himself.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn was sent to temporary living quarters on board the ''Strikefast'', and a separate meeting was held between Parck and Vanto. In this meeting it was determined that, due to his knowledge of the Chiss and Sy Bisti, Vanto would serve as Thrawn's translator and [[teacher]] of [[Galactic Basic Standard|Galactic Basic]] for the duration of the trip to Coruscant. Vanto resented his assignment but nevertheless complied with his orders.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Meeting at the Imperial Palace====\n{{Quote|Captain Parck, I'm told you bring me a gift.''\"<br />\"''I do, Your Majesty.

In addition to helping Thrawn with his basic, Vanto told him the legend of the Chiss that he had heard growing up on Lysatra. Thrawn was amused by the legends, finding them interesting and informative but at times false or over-exaggerated. The two also discussed the Empire, particularly the Empire's social hierarchy and [[Xenophobia|prejudices]] against [[alien]]s and those not from the [[Core Worlds]]. Vanto also told the Chiss of his career goal of becoming a [[Quartermaster|supply officer]] in the [[Imperial Navy]]. Although Thrawn initially took an interest in Vanto to learn of humans' legends of the Chiss, the exfiltrated senior captain saw untapped talent in Vanto's tactical and analytical abilities and sought to make the human cadet his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOnce the ''Strikefast'' reached Coruscant, Thrawn, Vanto, Barris, Parck, and several [[navy]] troopers and stormtroopers boarded a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]] for the flight to the [[Imperial Palace]]. Despite knowing the importance of the man he was about to meet, Thrawn did not feel daunted by the prospect of meeting the Emperor. Instead, Vanto noticed, he looked maddeningly confident. Attempting to calm himself down, Vanto told himself that they would not be seeing the [[Galactic Emperor]] himself, but only palace officials. The human cadet was, however, wrong.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nUpon debarking from the shuttle, Thrawn and the Imperials were guided by two of Palpatine's red-clad personal [[Emperor's Royal Guard|royal guardsmen]] to the [[Emperor's throne room (Imperial Palace)|Emperor's throne room]]. Once they had arrived before the Emperor, Parck presented Thrawn as a gift to him. Thrawn, however, offered himself as not a gift but a resource. He informed Palpatine that his native Chiss Ascendancy had discovered a mysterious threat in the Unknown Regions, offering his information on the threat in exchange for the Empire's help. In hope of convincing Palpatine that he was to be trusted, Thrawn offered the name of Skywalker as someone who could vouch for him, believing Skywalker to be a servant to the Emperor. The Emperor informed Thrawn that Skywalker had died at the end of the Clone Wars, but also that Skywalker had spoken highly of him before he had died. Accepting Thrawn's offer for information on the Unknown Regions, the Emperor offered something else in return: a role in the Imperial Navy. Thrawn accepted on the condition that he was allowed to keep Vanto as his translator.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nWishing to discuss the threat in the Unknown Regions further, Palpatine guided Thrawn to the privacy of his [[throne]] room's interior garden. Thrawn was impressed by the artistry of the garden, believing it to be indicative of power, subtlety, and depth of thought. Once within the garden, Thrawn and Palpatine discussed Palpatine's personal interest in the mysteries of the Unknown Regions. Palpatine decided that Thrawn did not need a translator, but Thrawn nevertheless requested Eli Vanto as his personal attach\u00e9. Secretly, Mitth'raw'nuruodo sought to develop Vanto's talents as a tactician and strategist. Emperor Palpatine agreed to Thrawn's request, decreeing that Thrawn would be assigned three months of training at Coruscant's [[Royal Imperial Academy]] with Vanto by his side. The three months of training corresponded to the remainder of Vanto's term as a cadet at Myomar Academy. Although Royal Imperial was the most prestigious of the [[Imperial Academy|Imperial Academies]], Vanto felt resentment for being reassigned without being asked his own wishes.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===Rising through the ranks===\n<!-- This section effectively covers Thrawn's life as an Imperial Cadet and officer prior to his main investigations into Nightswan -->\n====Education at the Royal Imperial Academy====\n{{Quote|His own mandate to the Academies is to turn out officers worthy of Imperial service.

I hope you'll prove good enough that he won't have to do that.|Commandant Deenlark to Thrawn|Thrawn (novel)}}\nUpon arriving at the Royal Imperial Academy, Thrawn and Vanto found their way to the office of [[Commandant]] [[Deenlark]], the Academy's top official. Thrawn was met with hostility there; Deenlark openly expressed contempt for the alien Thrawn and the fact that he had arrived in Deenlark's office by command of the Emperor. As the meeting with Deenlark drew to a close, Thrawn was informed that instead of graduating the academy as an [[ensign]] like Vanto, he would be graduating with the rank of lieutenant. Thrawn was given his lieutenant's [[rank insignia plaque]], which Deenlark secretly hoped would make Thrawn the target of bullying. On the way out of the office, Vanto informed Thrawn of Deenlark's intent, and Thrawn took the opportunity to learn more about the social hierarchy within the academy. Ultimately, Thrawn decided not to wear his rank plaque until it proved convenient to him, masquerading as a normal cadet.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nDuring their time at the academy, Thrawn and Vanto stayed in [[Barracks Two]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> The cadets trained in [[[hand-to-hand combat]], Imperial procedures and technology, equipment, and tactics.<ref name=\"Thrawn comic 1\" />\n\n[[File:ThrawnTuruyVantoRoyalImperialAcademy-Thrawn1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Thrawn spars with fellow cadets during a training exercise.]]\nFrom the start of their term at Royal Imperial, Thrawn and Vanto were plagued by incidences of bullying and harassment that were, for various reasons, not punishable. The culpability or intent could not be established, or the acts were made to look like accidents, or they merely did not cross a line into the realm of disciplinary action. Thrawn refused to respond, however, hypothesizing that the lack of response would embolden the bullies to act rashly and commit a punishable act of bullying. Thrawn's hypothesis proved true one month into the three-month term, when cadets [[Spenc Orbar]] and [[Rosita Turuy]] invited him and Vanto to play a card game called [[Highland Challenge]] in the metallurgy lab. Thrawn was aware that the offer was a trap intended to get the Chiss and Vanto caught [[gambling]] for [[credit]]s and being in a lab they were not authorized to be in, but chose to accept the offer anyway. Vanto protested Thrawn's decision, but Thrawn felt confident that he could twist the trap in his favor.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nArriving in the lab at the appointed time, Thrawn and Eli were quick to turn down Orbar and Turuy's offer to play for credits. Turuy was upset with their decision, but decided not to push the matter. The four proceeded to play a tense game of Highland Challenge, Orbar and Thrawn discussing the topic of traps in the context of hands of cards. As the round drew to an end and Orbar activated his trap by discreetly calling in an [[instructor]], Thrawn slipped on his lieutenant's rank plaque. The instructor, powerless to punish a lieutenant for being in the lab, was forced to reluctantly let Thrawn and Vanto go, much to Orbar and Turuy's chagrin. Confident that he had dismantled the trap and sufficiently embarrassed the two antagonistic cadets, Thrawn set down his hand of cards and declared that the game was over. Rather than seeking for the instructor to punish Turyu and Obrar, lieutenant Thrawn told the instructor that the cadets were running a metallurgical test and he and his translator Vanto were merely observing their progress. Once the instructor left, Thrawn said to the thoroughly embarassed Rosita and Spec that there was no guaranteed winning hand, a metaphor for both Highland Challenge and the trap in which they sought to ensnare Thrawn.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:RoyalAcademyAttack.png|thumb|left|280px|Thrawn fighting three attacking cadets while Vanto looks on the scene in horror]]\nThrawn and Vanto walked back to their barracks and Vanto expressed his admiration for Thrawn and how he had managed to subvert the trap with such precise timing. A moment later, Thrawn pushed Vanto into the bushes as he was assailed by [[Gimm (lieutenant)|Gimm]] and two other cadets who had been called to the scene by Orbar and Turuy. Thrawn fought off the assailants, allowing them to land a few hits in order to assess their combat skills before, with the help of a distraction from Vanto, injuring one of the assailants and causing all three to scatter.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAfter the assailants had fled the scene, Thrawn and Vanto returned to Deenlark's office to report the incident. Thrawn deduced that the attack had been masterminded by Orbar and Turuy, and informed Deenlark that the assailants were likely friends of the two cadets. When Deenlark protested that it would be impossible for him to punish the guilty cadets because of their influential parents, Thrawn suggested that rather than being punished, Gimm and the assailants should be transferred to [[Skystrike Academy]] for fighter pilot training. He explained that during the fight he had observed that all three had tremendous aptitude as fighter pilots and that it would be a waste of their potential if they were not transferred to Skystrike. Furthermore, Thrawn argued that the punishment would create paranoia, as Gimm and the assailants would live in fear that they would one day be punished, while Orbar and Turuy would be frightened by the fact that their friends had disappeared so suddenly. Deenlark agreed to carry out Thrawn's suggestion, and the matter was closed.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nTwo standard months later, Thrawn graduated the Royal Imperial Academy as a lieutenant. On the day of his graduation, Thrawn received a second rank insignia plaque, Deenlark having forgotten that he gave Thrawn his plaque the day he arrived at the school. Thrawn held onto his spare plaque for later use if he ever needed it. After the graduation ceremony, Thrawn briefly met Eli Vanto's [[Vanto (Mr.)|father]] and [[Vanto (Ms.)|mother]] who both expressed subtle discomfort around him. As they left, the Vantos mentioned wishing they could use their [[beckon call]], a technology that intrigued Thrawn greatly. After the Vantos were gone, Thrawn and Vanto reported to Deenlark's office for the first assignments of their careers.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn was assigned to be [[second weapons officer]] of the [[Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]] ''[[Blood Crow]]'', and Vanto was assigned the role of his [[aide]]. Though it was not unusual for high-ranking officers to have aides, lieutenants were not normally assigned one. Vanto and Thrawn boarded the transport and began their careers in the Imperial Navy.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Service aboard the ''Blood Crow''====\n{{Quote|The ''Blood Crow'' is scheduled for duty in border sectors where Sy Bisti may be spoken.|Lieutenant Thrawn, to Eli Vanto|Thrawn 1}}\n[[File:Blood-Crow.png|thumb|right|x240px|The ''Blood Crow'', where Thrawn and Vanto were first assigned after graduation]]\nFor the first eighteen months of his service aboard the ''Blood Crow'', Thrawn served under Captain [[Rik Virgilio]] hunting smugglers, aiding distressed vessels, and defusing political situations in the Mid and Outer Rims. Thrawn enjoyed his service under Virgilio, facing little to no discrimination and enjoying a quick promotion to [[First weapons officer]]. Additionally, Virgilio granted Thrawn use of the ''Blood Crow''{{'s}} previously unused Number Two storage bay to store the collection of Clone Wars&ndash;era technology that Thrawn was amassing. Thrawn was using the technology as a means to study the era and war, and by the end of the eighteen months, he had collected two [[doonium]]-shelled [[Mark One Pistoeka sabotage droid|Mark One]] [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|Buzz Droids]], a [[droideka]], half of a [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform]] (STAP), and most of a hyperdrive ring. This was not to last, however, as Virgilio was replaced suddenly and without explanation by Captain [[Filia Rossi]], who had previously served as first officer of an [[ore freighter]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn found himself at odds with Rossi not long after she first set foot aboard the ''Blood Crow''. Discovering Thrawn's stash of Clone Wars technologies while surveying the ship with First Officer [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Nels Deyland]], Rossi demanded a meeting between the three of them in the storage bay. Rossi, eager to assert her dominance as captain, demanded that Thrawn's collection be dumped or otherwise destroyed. Thrawn, who still had plans for his collection, argued that he should be allowed to keep his collection due to the value of the pieces that he had accrued with his own credits. With the help of Deyland, Thrawn managed to argue Rossi down to a compromise. She told Thrawn that he was allowed to keep his collection until the ''Blood Crow'' reached [[Ansion]]. In that time he would be allowed to continue to attempt to repair the buzz droids in order to bring them up to their maximum market value. At that point, the collection would be turned over to her and she would be allowed to sell it. Thrawn agreed to the compromise. Unbeknownst to Rossi, Thrawn had already managed to get the buzz droids back to full working order.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn found his service under Rossi notably more difficult than his service under Virgilio. Unlike Virgilio, Rossi was prejudiced against aliens and took offense to the fact that Thrawn was allowed an aide. As a result, Thrawn was assigned to every dirty, nasty, or undesirable job on the ''Blood Crow'' while working under Rossi.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====The ''Dromedar'' hijacking====\n{{Quote|A warrior may forget that even the task of identifying the enemy can be difficult. And the cost of that failure can lead to catastrophe.|Passage from Thrawn's journal|Thrawn (novel)}}\n[[File:Dromedar.png|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn approaches the ''Dromedar'' on his shuttle.]]\nAs a consequence of Rossi's tendency to assign him to the undesirable jobs, Thrawn was not surprised when he and Vanto were assigned to investigate the distress call coming from the cargo freighter ''[[Dromedar]]''. The freighter was carrying a valuable shipment of [[Static-locking|static-locked]] [[tibanna]] [[gas]], a locking mechanism infamous for generating incredible amounts of dirt and dust. Once the ''Blood Crow'' reached the adrift ''Dromedar'', Thrawn boarded a shuttle to the vessel alongside a boarding party which consisted of Vanto, Ensign [[Merri Barlin]], [[electronics technician]] [[Layneo]], and [[engineering technician]] [[Jakeeb]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOnce they had boarded the ''Dromedar'', Thrawn assigned Vanto, Layneo, and Jakeeb to investigate the engine section while he made his way to the bridge with Barlin. Several minutes later, Vanto signaled Thrawn that he had found someone in the central passageway. Thrawn instructed Vanto to return to the bridge with the prisoner.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAt this moment Thrawn met the man he would later come to know as [[Nevil Cygni|Nightswan]], currently operating under the alias \"Nevil Cygni.\" Thrawn asked Nightswan why he had threatened Vanto, Layneo, and Jakeeb, to which he replied that he had mistaken them for pirates. He explained to Thrawn that the ''Dromedar'' had been attacked by pirates hoping to make off with the tibanna gas and that they had taken the crew of the freighter hostage while they returned to their base to get a [[slicer]] to help them restart the ''Dromedar''{{'s}} hyperdrive. Assessing the situation, Thrawn commanded Vanto to contact Rossi and request a full operational team to either restart the hyperdrive or transfer the tibanna gas canisters to the ''Blood Crow''. Vanto protested that Rossi would not like Thrawn's request, but Thrawn did not change his mind. Once Vanto had gone to relay the message, Thrawn began a thorough examination of the ship.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs Vanto had predicted, Thrawn was not granted his requested full operational team by Rossi. Instead, Thrawn was granted the supplies he needed and up to three crew members aside from Vanto and himself. Additionally, they would be left to deal with the ''Dromedar'' situation on their own as the ''Blood Crow'' had been called to [[Moltok]] to deal with a [[Makurth]] [[Unidentified Makurth boss|boss]]' [[Crisis on Moltok|attack]] on a [[Ho'Din]] [[Unidentified Ho'Din settlement|settlement]]. Thrawn was fine with this arrangement, remaining on the ''Dromedar'' with Vanto, Barlin, Layneo, and Jakeeb as the ''Blood Crow'' voyaged to Moltok.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOn the ''Dromedar''{{'s}} bridge, Thrawn oversaw Barlin and Layneo's attempts to find an asymmetric backdoor code that would get the ship up and running again. As they worked, Thrawn moved with Vanto and Nightswan to the cargo bay. There, Thrawn unpacked one of his crates of supplies from the ''Blood Crow'', revealing one of his two Mark I Buzz Droids. Taking the buzz droid to where the tibanna canisters static-locked to the hull, Thrawn explained his plan to free the tibanna. The static-lock functioned to seal the canisters, but only from the cargo bay side. Thrawn intended to use his buzz droid to cut through the hull and free the tibanna canisters from outside the ship. Nightswan was impressed with the plan, shocked he had not come up with it himself and that it was not used more commonly. Thrawn admitted that his plan was not completely unheard of, but that it would require the sacrifice of one of the tibanna canisters; a sacrifice many were unwilling to make. This plan proved unnecessary, however, when Barlin and Layneo got the hyperdrive back in working order.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nWhen he turned back around to face Nightswan, however, Thrawn found himself staring down the barrel of Nightswan's second blaster. Nightswan had intended to [[Dromedar hijacking|hijack the ''Dromedar'']]. Calmly, Cygni requested that Thrawn order Barlin, Layneo, Jakeeb, and Vanto to surrender so that no one would have to be harmed. Before Thrawn could give the order, however, he found himself, Vanto, and Jakeeb surrounded by [[Angel (pirate)|Angel]] and his [[Culoss]] pirate crew. Nightswan gave Thrawn one more chance to surrender, and Thrawn obeyed, surrendering and commanding Barlin and Layneo to surrender via comlink.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn, Vanto, Barlin, Layneo, and Jakeeb were then taken, with the buzz droid, to Angel's ship [[Marauder (frigate)|''Marauder'']] to be with the prisoners from the ''Dromedar''. Nightswan, only interested in the tibanna and ''Dromedar'', demanded that Thrawn and the prisoners be dropped off unharmed at a predetermined rendezvous. Angel had wished to kill Thrawn but reluctantly agreed, locking up the Imperials with the ''Dromedar'' crew.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOnce they were locked inside the cell, Thrawn proceeded to wait silently until Nightswan and Angel had re-boarded the ''Dromedar'' and jumped to [[lightspeed]]. Once the ''Dromedar'' had gone, Thrawn set his plan into action. He asked Layneo if she could isolate the bridge and fly the ''Marauder'' from the control panel in the room, to which she replied that she could as long as she could reach the panel. Pleased with Layneo's answer, Thrawn removed his insignia plaque, revealing that he had turned the spare plaque from graduation into a beckon call for the buzz droids. Using the beckon call, Thrawn guided the buzz droid to attack the prison cell's locking mechanism. Drawn by the commotion, three pirates entered the lockup, and Thrawn redirected the buzz droid to attack them. While they were distracted with the buzz droid, Jakeeb kicked apart the damaged cell door, and the Imperials and prisoners rushed the pirates. The three pirates were subdued, and Thrawn directed his second buzz droid to cut the ship in half so that they could avoid a confrontation with the pirates in the forward portion of the vessel. Emergency airlocks sealed the sections of the ships from the vacuum. Once Layneo had used the control panel to gain control of what remained of the ship, Thrawn took command of the ''Marauder'', with the ''Dromedar''{{'s}} captain [[Fitz]] asking what course to set.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nBack aboard the ''Blood Crow'', Thrawn and Vanto were brought before Rossi to justify their actions aboard the ''Dromedar'' and the ''Marauder''. In the meeting, Thrawn revealed that he had realized Nightswan was deceiving him, had anticipated his betrayal, and had allowed himself to be captured in hopes of locating and rescuing the crew of the ''Dromedar''. Rossi was unhappy with Thrawn's report, berating him for choosing to save the crew instead over the more financially valuable tibanna gas. Thrawn was baffled by Rossi's assessment, believing that his decision to save the crew and capture some of the pirates was the correct one. Rossi, however, stuck by her original statement, believing the value of tibanna outweighed the value of the lives the Chiss second weapons officer had saved. As a punishment for Thrawn's failure in the eyes of the [[Imperial High Command]], Rossi sentenced Thrawn to suspension at Admiral [[Plor Wiskovis]]' [[Ansion Imperial base|base on Ansion]] while she waited for an official ruling from Coruscant regarding Thrawn's actions. Seeing this as his opportunity to get the ''Dromedar'' back, Thrawn subtly manipulated Rossi into sentencing Vanto to suspension along with him.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Aftermath of the ''Dromedar'' incident====\n{{Quote|You still saved the ship, along with almost half the tibanna and the ''Dromedar''{{'s}} crew. And you caught most of the pirates.''\"<br />\"''Considering the value the High Command places on tibanna, they may not consider that a sufficient victory.|Colonel Yularen and Thrawn discuss Thrawn's rescue of the ''Dromedar''.|Thrawn (novel)}}\nThanks to Thrawn's actions on Ansion, the ''Dromedar'' and its tibanna canisters were found and recovered although Nightswan managed to evade capture. Once the tibanna canisters were checked, however, it was discovered that Nightswan had managed to covertly steal the contents of twelve of the twenty canisters using a variation of the technique that Thrawn had suggested aboard the ''Dromedar''. This partial defeat vexed Thrawn greatly, kicking off his obsession and rivalry with Nightswan.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n[[File:Thrawn_interrogates_pirates_SWT2.png|thumb|right|300px|Thrawn interrogating the prisoners]]\n\nOnce on Ansion, Thrawn convinced Admiral Wiskovis to allow him to interrogate the three pirates they had captured, and to allow Vanto as a witness to the interrogation. The Chiss lieutenant correctly deduced that the pirates, who called themselves Culoss, were remnants from the crew of the [[Pirate king|pirate queen]] [[Q'anah (pirate)|Q'anah]], which had been known as [[Q'anah's Marauders]]. Thrawn threatened the three prisoners with a visit from [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]],<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> the man who had been responsible for the death of Q'anah and most of her crew as a leader of the [[Outland Regions Security Force]]<ref name=\"Tarkin\">[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']]</ref> in [[46 BBY]].<ref name=\"Qanah date\">[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] establishes that [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] was eighteen [[Standard year|years]] old when Q'anah [[Death|died]], and sixty-four years old at the time of his own death at the [[Battle of Yavin]], dated to [[0 BBY]] by ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''. Q'anah's death can therefore be placed in [[46 BBY]].</ref> The pirates, frightened by the prospect of being turned over to Tarkin, allowed Thrawn to tell them his deal. In exchange for the location of Nightswan, Angel, and the ''Dromedar'', Thrawn offered the pirates safe transport out of the [[sector]] before Tarkin and the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] (ISB) arrived for additional interrogations. Hoping to trick Thrawn, the pirates had a short conversation in Sy Bisti, a regional trade language of low prestige and poor regard in the galaxy's core, and one which they did not believe any Imperial officers would understand. In their Sy Bisti dialog, the Culoss pirates plannet to give Thrawn false information in order to secure their freedom. Speaking in Basic once more, the pirates told Thrawn that the ''Dromedar'' had been taken to [[Cartherston]] on the planet [[Keitum]]. Thrawn and Vanto, both of whom spoke Sy Bisti, understood that this was a lie, but Thrawn nevertheless noted Cartherston as a location of interest as he believed it had come up to quickly to truly be of no consequence to the pirates.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOut of the interrogation room, Thrawn, Vanto, and Wiskovis determined from the pirates' [[List of phrases and slang|slang words]] \"trapo,\" \"ub-dub,\" and \"squalsh\" to determine that the ''Dromedar'' had been taken to a trading post (\"trapo\") on the planet [[Uba]] in the [[Barsa sector]]. Hoping to save Wiskovis from any of the career fallout that Thrawn feared might accompany his actions, Thrawn volunteered to take full responsibility for the operation to Uba to rescue the ''Dromedar''. Interpreting this action as Thrawn attempting to hoard the glory, Wiskovis became angry and argued with Thrawn for several minutes before ultimately deciding to save the argument for later. Returning to the more pressing matter at hand, Thrawn and Wiskovis dispatched forces to Uba and Keitum to arrest the pirates and retake the tibanna gas. Hypothesizing that the stolen tibanna may be taken from Uba to the nearby tibanna producing planet [[Kril'Dor]], Thrawn also ordered a force be sent there as part of the reclamation effort.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Alisandre_Hotel_ballroom.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Driller MarDapp]] points out Thrawn.]]\nDespite the fact that the operation had been a strategic success, Thrawn found himself facing the threat of a [[court-martial]] from High Command due to his actions throughout the ''Dromedar'' incident. As such, Thrawn spent the following [[Ascension Week]] and [[Empire Day]] on Coruscant, touring parties and mingling with the influential elite alongside Vanto and ISB Colonel [[Wullf Yularen]]. Yularen believed that Thrawn's actions on Ansion had been justified and beneficial, and sought to aid Thrawn with the court marshal by introducing him to [[senator]]s and [[minister]]s that he felt could be an asset during the investigation. It was at one such Ascension Week party, the party in the [[Alisandre Hotel]]'s grand ballroom, where Thrawn met [[Arihnda Pryce]] for the first time, then an aide to [[Lothal]] Senator [[Domus Renking]]. The two spoke briefly, and Pryce correctly guessed Thrawn's purpose at the party; before Yularen, Thrawn, and Vanto moved on to speak to another senator.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn and Yularen's social strategy ultimately paid off, as Thrawn was cleared of all charges by the court-martial committee. Despite the committee's decision to officially close the ''Dromedar'' incident, Thrawn continued to be bothered by the incident's outcome and Nightswan's cunning. Additionally, he found Nightswan's knowledge of the Mark I Buzz Droid's value intriguing, asking Vanto if he could investigate supply and demand of the rare metal doonium in the galaxy. Thrawn had begun to suspect that the Empire was working on a [[Project Stardust|secret military project]] of some sort, and wished to discover the truth. It turned out that Nightswan shared similar suspicions of and interest in such a project.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAfter the court-martial committee made their decision, Thrawn received new orders from High Command. He was promoted from lieutenant to captain and assigned the role of First Officer aboard the [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser]] ''[[Thunder Wasp]]'' with Vanto still assigned as his aide. Thrawn was disappointed that Vanto was not promoted, having recommended Vanto for both a rank promotion and a combat position, but the two accepted their new assignments nonetheless.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Hunting down pirates and insurgents====\n{{Quote|What matters is the future of the Imperial Navy.

And I, too, have learned a great deal from you.|Alfren Cheno and Thrawn|Thrawn (novel)}}\nAfter being assigned to the ''Thunder Wasp'', Thrawn spent the next year hunting smugglers and pirates in the [[Mid Rim Territories]] under the guidance of Commander [[Alfren Cheno]]. During this time, Thrawn also made five visits to Coruscant, traveling to the Imperial Palace to help Emperor Palpatine map the Unknown Regions. Thrawn also paid a visit to Yularen during each of his five visits to Coruscant, working with him on an investigation of Nightswan's identity and activities in the galaxy.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nSometime towards the end of his first year of service aboard the ''Thunder Wasp'', Thrawn noticed a sudden uptick in the value of vulture droids while shopping for his collection. Hoping to investigate, Thrawn purchased another vulture droid part, sneaking a glimpse at the [[Rodian]] [[Unidentified Rodian merchant|salesman's]] order requests when the merchant focused his attention elsewehere. In the order requests, Thrawn discovered that Nightswan had purchased a large number of vulture droid parts from the merchant and paid with the rare metal [[Iridium (element)|iridium]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nNot long after, Thrawn and Vanto investigated and arrested a group of smugglers who had been smuggling iridium in the shells of [[Paklarn]] [[grist mollusk]]s. Looking into the matter further, Thrawn deduced that the smuggling operation had been masterminded by Nightswan and that Nightswan had used the smuggled iridium to pay for large shipments of vulture droids. Pressing the captured smugglers for details, Thrawn discovered that Nightswan had mentioned<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> the Expansion Region planet<ref name=\"Darkness on Umbara\">{{TCW|Darkness on Umbara}}</ref> [[Umbara]] when he had been instructing the smugglers. Eli Vanto dismissed Umbara as a false lead, believing that Umbara would not dare to try insurgency again after joining the Separatists and [[Battle of Umbara|suffering heavy losses]] during the Clone Wars. Thrawn, however, felt confident in his intuition and believed that an investigation of insurgent activity on Umbara was necessary.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn's intuition proved correct; insurgent activity was discovered on Umbara and the ''Thunder Wasp'' was dispatched to help put a stop to it with Admiral [[Carlou Gendling]]'s [[Carlou Gendling's task force|task force]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Battle over Umbara====\n{{Quote|It would seem we have found the reason for the attack. The purpose for a clearly futile assault upon an Imperial force. Nightswan wished for the Empire to take control of Umbara's mines.''\"<br />\"''Because its easier for him and his smugglers to cheat material past Imperial inspectors than past the Umbarans. I'll grant that it sounds like Nightswan's brand of deviousness. But we don't even know for sure that he was involved.''\"<br />\"''He was. He is. Who else would invite me here to demonstrate his handiwork?|Thrawn and Eli Vanto discussing Nightswan|Thrawn (novel)}}\n[[File:Umbara_TVE.png|thumb|right|200px|The planet Umbara]]\nThrawn spent the entirety of the passage to Umbara locked away in his cabin. He used the solitude to immerse himself in [[Umbaran]] art, surrounding himself with [[hologram]]s of Umbaran art through the ages. He noted the subtle differences between [[Republic Era|Republic]] and [[Imperial Era]] art, using the similarities and differences to extrapolate details of modern Umbaran culture and military doctrine.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn was interrupted mid-thought when Vanto entered his cabin to inform him that they had arrived at Umbara and that Cheno had requested his presence at the bridge. By the time Thrawn arrived at the bridge, the ''Thunder Wasp'' was in position and ready for battle, joined by Gendling's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial'' Star Destroyer]] (ISD) ''[[Foremost]]'' and two [[Raider-class corvette|''Raider''-class corvettes]]. As they stood on the bridge, Cheno joked with Thrawn that he hoped the Umbarans would attack so that he and the ''Thunder Wasp'' could finally get some recognition. Thrawn, however, felt it was unlikely that the Umbarans would attack.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn watched from the bridge alongside Vanto and Cheno as Gendling delivered his ultimatum to the Umbaran insurgents, demanding that they hand over their leaders within the hour or face reprisal. Even as Vanto declared the matter finished after Gendling's ultimatum, a [[battle over Umbara|battle erupted]] as four-hundred vulture droids appeared from behind [[Umbara's outermost moon]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs the battle began and Cheno commanded a counterattack against the vulture droids, Vanto was quick to point out to Thrawn that he had been wrong. Thrawn, however, stood by his original statement, deducing that the attack was not by the Umbarans and that they were merely watching it in hopes of deciding whether or not to join in.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs the battle continued and the ''Thunder Wasp'' sustained greater damage, Thrawn realized that Cheno was unable to command the battle and promptly seized control of the ''Thunder Wasp''. Moving Senior Lieutenant [[Hammerly]] to a [[turbolaser]] station, Thrawn sat down with Vanto at Hammerly's sensor station to study the attack patterns of the vulture droids. After several moments of watching the vulture droid attack patterns, Thrawn was able to deduce that the vulture droids were performing too effectively to be commanded by their pre-programmed swarm behavior. Instead, they were being controlled directly by a transmitting base.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Thrawn knew both from experience against vulture droids<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> and their geometry and artistry that they were designed for swarm tactics, which they were not presently employing, and explained his reasoning to Vanto.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nHaving taken control of Hammerly's sensor station, Thrawn's true goal at the moment was to infer the location of the transmitting base that was in control of the vulture droids. The Chiss captain had noticed that the droid fighters intermittently reverted to their programmed swarm tactics, which indicated their passage through a transmission shadow from other ships or objects blocking their line-of-sight to the controlling transmitter. As such, Thrawn used the sensors to pinpoint the location of the droids' transmitter tower, which was on the surface of Umbara. His analytical work done, Thrawn called out to Cheno, telling him to contact Gendling to inform him of the location of the base. Gendling, however, felt that Thrawn's assessment was merely guesswork and disregarded the advice. Vanto commented to himself that normally it would be reasonable not to fire at a population center, and many Imperial officers would not hesistate to do so, but this circumstance was different as Thrawn had proven it was the location of the enemy's transmitter and a surgical strike would quickly minimize the droids' combat effectiveness.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:CIS_Vulture_droid.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Vulture droids, which Nevil Cygni used to draw the Empire to take control of Umbara's mining operations]]\nFrustrated with Gendling's ineptitude, Thrawn ordered the Communications Officer to signal the remaining ships to attack the vulture droids when they passed through the transmission shadows. The other ships acknowledged Thrawn's strategy and shifted tactics, quickly turning the tide of the battle. By the end of the battle, one of the [[corvette]]s had been destroyed and the remaining corvette, ''Thunder Wasp'', and ''Foremost'' were all badly damaged, but the vulture droids had been destroyed and Umbara unconditionally surrendered. Vanto believed the Imperial warships all sustained far more damage than they would have if Gendling had listed to Thrawn.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nEven though Thrawn's strategy had won what had begun to appear to be a losing battle, Gendling was furious with both Thrawn and Cheno for their roles in the battle. His pride bruised, Gendling promised Cheno that the battle would be the end of his career. When Gendling turned on Thrawn, however, Cheno stepped in to save the Chiss captain's career. Once they were alone Cheno admitted that he believed Thrawn to be the future of the Imperial Navy, saying that it had been a privilege to be Thrawn's commander, even for a short time.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAfter departing from the meeting with Gendling and Cheno, Thrawn met with Vanto to discuss the possibility of Nightswan's involvement in the battle. Thrawn asked Vanto, who was a skilled numerical analyst, to analyze the value of Umbaran [[ore]] as well as the success rates of smugglers on Umbara versus smugglers on worlds where the Empire controlled mining and the supply line of metals. As the Chiss suspected, smugglers had significantly more success smuggling and skimming metals from planets with Imperial-controlled industry than those operated independently. Thus, Thrawn reasoned that Cygni had orchestrated the events on Umbara to ensure that the Empire took over Umbara's mines and facilitate his smuggling operations. Going even further, Thrawn concluded that Nightswan had purposefully allowed the iridium smugglers to be caught in order to draw the Imperials to Umbara. Impressed, Thrawn admitted that he would be forced to wait until Nightswan chose to resurface again to take further action against the insurgent leader.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs a result of the actions taken during the battle, Cheno was forced to retire by Gendling and High Command. This decision angered Thrawn greatly as he considered it nothing more or less than a foolish waste of resources. Surprised by Thrawn's reaction, Vanto informed him that Cheno was neither the first navy career Thrawn had destroyed nor was it the last career he would destroy. Thrawn was vexed by this, but resigned himself to the reality of his situation and his inability to control or even understand the Empire's military politics.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===Investigating Nightswan===\n<!-- Thrawn's time after the battle over Umbara and before the Batonn sector insurgency -->\n====Meeting with Yularen====\n{{Quote|One would think Nubia equally immune to such threats.

Yularen reported that the ISB had managed to connect Nightswan to metal smuggling, purchases of antiques, and political protests; but had not been able to determine the man's identity. Intrigued by the mention of political protesting, Thrawn asked Yularen to give him a list of the insurgent activities Nightswan was associated with. Pursuing his inquiry further, Thrawn asked Yularen about insurgent activity on Coruscant. Yularen brushed off his theory, believing that political unrest in the Imperial capital planet's lower-class lower levels would never be able to impact anything. Thrawn refused to relent, however, countering Yularen's disbelief by citing the [[Circle Bay mayor's office protest|protest]] in the [[Circle Bay]] [[Circle Bay mayor's office|mayor's office]] on [[Nubia]]. Yularen pointed out that the protest had only succeeded because the insurgents had managed to infiltrate the servant staff in the capital, and Thrawn deduced that insurgency on Coruscant could be equally effective if insurgents [[Imperial espionage operation|infiltrated]] the government via [[bodyguard]] training dojos. Yularen conceded that Thrawn had a point, and the three set off for an investigation of Coruscant's dojos.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Visit to the Yinchom Dojo====\n{{Quote|Excellent, Captain.

While waiting to speak with H'sishi, Thrawn once again found himself talking to Arihnda Pryce, now working for [[Higher Skies Advocacy Group]] and at the dojo for self-defense lessons and networking with senate guards.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAfter a brief conversation with Pryce, Thrawn spoke with H'sishi, obtaining records of the dojo's government contracts and trained guards. Seeking to learn more about the difficult-to-read Togorian in front of him, Thrawn challenged H'sishi to an advanced stick fighting duel under the guise of searching for an instructor for an urban combat unit. In truth, Thrawn hoped to learn of her possible connection to subversive activities through her behavior and tactics in combat. Just prior to the duel, Thrawn asked Pryce for the name of her advocacy group, paying attention to the reactions of those around him when Pryce revealed the name of her organization. As the two dueled, Thrawn observed not only H'sishi but also Pryce and her friend [[Juahir Madras]], observing Madras' nervousness and H'sishi's single-minded focus on combat. After the duel, Thrawn complimented H'sishi's Togorian-inspired style of stick fighting, expressing his interest in one day learning it from her.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOutside the dojo, Thrawn shared his findings with Vanto and Yularen, reporting that he believed there was more to Higher Skies than met the eye and that while H'sishi was undoubtedly innocent, Juahir Madras was likely complicit. Thrawn wished to pursue the investigation further, but new orders from High Command prevented that wish from becoming a reality.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn had been commanded to spend the next four weeks at the Imperial Palace, charting the Unknown Regions with Emperor Palpatine while the ''Thunder Wasp'' underwent repairs. Once the repairs were finished, Thrawn was once again assigned to patrol the Mid Rim and Outer Rim, but he had been promoted to a commander and the captain of the ''Thunder Wasp'' following Cheno's imposed retirement.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Covert meeting with Pryce====\n{{Quote|You're to good for those who dislike you to attack directly.

Ghadi believed the Higher Skies advocacy group sought to destroy him, and sought to force Pryce to counter-spy on the group itself under threat of turning her into the ISB on false charges if she refused. Further, the Moff wished to blackmail Pryce into blackmailing other Imperial officials on his behalf, including Ghadi's arch-enemy Grand Moff Tarkin.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn wore [[glasses]] and a hood to conceal his identity and masquerade as a [[Pantoran]], meeting Pryce in the [[Gilroy Plaza Diner]] to discuss Ghadi's trap and how to dismantle it. Pryce handed Thrawn a [[datacard]] filled with evidence of Ghadi's corruption, requesting that he hand it along to Yularen and ensure that only Yularen knew that it came from her. While extorting Pryce, Ghadi inadvertently revealed to her that one of his mines&mdash;a mine rich in doonium&mdash;had recently been attacked by insurgents. Notably, Ghadi's mine was unregistered and the Moff was using it to sell metals on the black market without paying proper taxes and duties.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn agreed to do as she asked, but refused to hand Pryce's blackmail dossier to Yularen until the best possible moment, deducing that the longer it stayed in the ISB, the more likely it was that Ghadi would use personal agents within the ISB to acquire or sabotage the information. Pryce argued that she was unwilling to wait, attempting to bribe Thrawn to give it to Yularen as quickly as possible. The two discussed the politics of military promotions and ship repairs, with Pryce offering to use her contacts to both speed up the repairs of the ''Thunder Wasp'' and to get Vanto his long-denied promotion. Thrawn was receptive to Pyrce's offers, placing a high value on Vanto's promotion and his ship's repairs. As his end of the bargain, Thrawn offered Pryce some military advice; he advised her to use Ghadi's hatred of Tarkin to her advantage to either ally herself with Tarkin or use Tarkin to force Ghadi to ally himself with her.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nBefore he left the diner, Thrawn asked Pryce if she would be willing to turn on the Higher Skies group if it was discovered that they were involved in insurgent activity. Pryce replied that she would absolutely turn her back on them if that should be required for her to have Yularen's protection from Ghadi.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Afe Clan land dispute====\n{{Quote|So what's this one about, sir?\"''<br />''\"It appears to be a land dispute, Ensign. On one side is the Afe clan of the native Cyphari. On the other side is a group of human colonists in an enclave pressing up against Afe territory.|Eli Vanto and Thrawn|Thrawn (novel)}}\nSome time after Commander Thrawn and ensign Vanto returned to patrol duty on the ''Thunder Wasp'', the ''Arquitens''-class [[light cruiser]] was assigned the investigation of a [[Cyphar Incident|land dispute]] on the planet [[Cyphar]] between the native [[Cyphari]] and human colonists. Thrawn had requested the assignment to investigate, mediate, and solve the dispute. Thrawn noticed an uptick in [[shellfish]] exports from Cyphar reminiscent of the Nightswan-led smuggling operation that had led him to Umbara, and correctly saw the shared motif as an invitation from Nightswan to mediate the dispute. Thrawn spent the passage to Cyphar discussing his Nightswan theories with Vanto, particularly his belief that Nightswan was connected to the sharp increases in doonium theft, land disputes, and general unrest that had begun to spread the Empire's military thin.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Thrawn_4_Cyphar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn and Vanto onboard a shuttle as it approaches Cyphar]]\nOnce on Cyphar, Thrawn and Vanto attended a meeting with the colonists of the human colony, [[Hollenside Enclave]], involved in the dispute. The Imperial officers discussed the dispute's circumstances [[mayor]] [[Pord Benchel]] and other colonists including [[Lenora Scath]], [[Brigte Polcery]], [[Clay Tanoo]], and a small committee of other concerned citizens. The meeting was brief and hostile, with Polcery and Scath in particular finding it ridiculous that Thrawn wished to hear both sides before making his decision. The dispute between the humans and the Cyphari [[Afe clan]] was not Thrawn's top priority during the meeting, however. Thrawn had deduced that the entire land dispute was an elaborate cover-up for smuggling operations and spent the meeting studying Benchel, Scath, Polcery, and Tanoo for signs of guilt or innocence in a scheme that the dispute was designed to hide.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn and Vanto took a shuttle to meet the Cyphari [[Chief]] [[Joko (Cyphari)|Joko]] of the Afe Clan, during which the Chiss  discussed his findings with his human assistant. The two had come to the same conclusion: Scath, Polcery, and Tanoo were all involved in the smuggling activity, but Mayor Benchel was oblivious to everything besides what had been reported to him about the land dispute. The two officers visited the mobile [[Afe clan meetinghouse]] to speak with Joko. Joko pleaded his case to Thrawn, telling him that the dispute had started when humans from the Hollenside Enclave had invaded Afe land and that all issues since then had either been self-defense or acts of retaliation. While in the meetinghouse, Thrawn subtly studied the artwork on the walls, ascertaining information on Afe culture and strategy. Thrawn gleaned from the art that the Cyphari would harbor intense guilt if they killed an opponent in combat.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nJoko then showed Thrawn the [[grain]] field where the incursions had occurred, along with a [[holo-map]] of likely [[airspeeder]] travel paths and the sites of both the human attacks on the Afe lands and the Cyphari counterattacks on Hollenside. Thrawn studied both the damaged grain and the attack locations, quickly discerning patterns and developing a plan to combat the invaders. Thrawn cautioned Joko against attacking Hollenside again, promising Joko that the situation would be resolved that night if he followed Thrawn's orders. Thrawn resolved to spend the night at the meetinghouse with Vanto, offering Joko stormtroopers for protection and ordering him to evacuate the surrounding area. Joko was hesitant, but followed Thrawn's commands after Thrawn promised once more that he would resolve the situation in a single night. Thrawn was confident in his promise that he could fix it that night; he had deduced that the colonists would see that evening as their final chance to advance the smuggling operation until the investigation was closed.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Thrawn_4_Cyphar_land_dispute.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn watches as Vanto stuns Tanoo's team.]]\nThat night, Thrawn and Vanto observed from a distance as three landspeeders full of humans, led by Tanoo, arrived on Afe Clan land and began digging for ore. Thrawn immediately focused his attention on Tanoo, asking Vanto to pull up Tanoo's full record on his [[datapad]]. Vanto revealed that Tanoo had studied organic chemistry, and that his [[Clay Tanoo's brother|brother]] had been arrested for possession of [[spice]] derived from [[Scarn (spice)|scarn]]. Thrawn found what he was looking for in the information about scarn, calling in stormtroopers and an escort of [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] led by Lieutenant Gimm to their location. Unbeknownst to Gimm, Thrawn had been the reason he was transferred from Royal Imperial to Skystrike Academy and thus became a starfighter pilot.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nHoping to stop the human perpetrators from escaping before they could be arrested, Thrawn drew his blaster and opened fire, destroying the repulsorlifts of two of the landspeeders. After a short firefight, Thrawn and Vanto managed to [[stun]] all of the perpetrators and arrest Tanoo, interrogating him at gunpoint in the speeder he had attempted to escape in. Tanoo admitted that Polcery had designed the scarn smuggling plot and that he had been forced to participate as the chemist. Thrawn was unsatisfied with his answer, however, pointing out to Tanoo that he could have easily changed the formula slightly to make a far less potent and illegal version of scarn that Polcery would never notice. Tanoo, trapped by Thrawn's logic, admitted that Thrawn was too clever for his lie but quickly added that he had done nothing that Thrawn had enough evidence to arrest him for. Thrawn then inquired about Nightswan, and Tanoo admitted that Scath had sought out Nightswan as a legendary smuggler to facilitate the expansion of their spice-trafficking operation.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nHaving nothing to charge Tanoo with but unwilling to accept defeat, Thrawn studied Tanoo's scarn sensor and quickly formulated a plan to end the scarn production, even without due cause to arrest Tanoo. Meeting with Gimm, Thrawn delivered him the sensor and commanded him to fly close to the ground, using it to follow the underground scarn vein. As Gimm flew along the vein, Thrawn ordered [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Osgoode]] to use the ''Thunder Wasp''{{'s}} turbolasers to obliterate the scarn vein behind him. Once the night was over, Thrawn's plan had succeeded and the scarn had been scorched out of existence.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn's plan, though successful, was met with backlash from both High Command on Coruscant and Joko on Cyphar. While Thrawn had nullified the reason for the humans' incursions into the Afe clan's lands, he had also damaged their cropland. In a final confrontation with Joko before he departed, Joko promised to appeal Thrawn's actions in hopes of securing yet another court-martial of the Chiss commander. Thrawn expressed no regret for his actions, however, believing that he had done the best he possibly could have in the situation. He felt complete apathy towards High Command's disdain for him, believing that they wanted him to be a yes-man but that there were some situations that could simply only be solved by his particular brand of strategy.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Promotion to Commodore====\n{{Quote|Never has any officer of the Imperial Navy achieved such success in so short a time.|An Imperial Navy admiral just before announcing Thrawn's promotion to commodore|Thrawn (novel)}}\n[[File:Tarkin_s_bonus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn is promoted to Commodore.]]\nFollowing Chief Joko's appeal to Imperial High Command, Thrawn was once again cleared of all charges of misconduct. He and the ''Thunder Wasp'' returned to hunting for smugglers and illicit activity connected to Nightswan. Using Vanto's knowledge of supplies and logistics, Thrawn was able to uncover and stamp out several doonium smuggling operations, at least two of which were connected to Nightswan. Frustrated that Nightswan was still slipping through the Empire's fingers, Thrawn contacted his fellow officers with warnings about Nightswan, but his warnings were generally not taken seriously. Additionally, Thrawn continued to be perplexed by the Empire's excessively high demand for doonium, having still found no answers despite his and Vanto's continued investigation.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nEventually, Thrawn and Vanto were surprised by a summons from High Command on Coruscant. Once on Coruscant, Thrawn and Vanto found themselves in the center of an award ceremony attended by various admirals and Grand Moff Tarkin. For his outstanding record of successes and his string of unusually fast promotions, Thrawn was promoted from commander to the rank of commodore and given command of the ISD ''[[Chimaera]]''. Additionally, Vanto was promoted from ensign to lieutenant commander, a decision that greatly pleased Thrawn. After the ceremony concluded, Thrawn briefly spoke with Tarkin, discussing Pryce's recent promotion to [[Governor]] of Lothal and subtly thanking Pryce for her role in Vanto's promotion. After Tarkin had departed, Thrawn briefly exchanged a heartfelt congratulations with Vanto before the two set off for their career aboard the ''Chimaera''. The ''Chimaera''{{'s}} prior first officer Commander [[Karyn Faro]] stayed on and retained her role.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Mission to aid the ''Sempre''====\n{{Dialogue|Thrawn|The attacking ships were reported stolen eight weeks ago.|Eli Vanto|By Nightswan?|Thrawn|Possibly.

Meeting on the bridge of the ship to discuss the mission with Commander Eli Vanto, [[senior communications officer]] [[Lomar]], [[Stormtrooper Commander]] [[Ayer]], and his first officer Karyn Faro, Thrawn discussed his belief that Nightswan was behind the theft of the frigate ''[[Castilus]]'' and [[V-19 Torrent starfighter]]s that had [[Attack on the Sempre|attacked]] the ''Sempre'', but not behind the attack itself. Thrawn also called into question the motivation behind the attack, as Ayer revealed that the ''Sempre'' was not in fact transporting stormtroopers when it was attacked. Ayer refused to divulge more, firmly asserting that the mission of the ''Sempre'' was classified and that only he and his troopers would be allowed aboard to combat the threat. Thrawn took this news in stride, calmly commanding Faro to check the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} weapons and Vanto to ensure that they were going at the quickest possible speed.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Sempre_aftermath.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn investigates the attack on the ''Sempre''.]]\nAlmost two hours later, Thrawn arrived at the site of the attack to discover that the crew of the ''Sempre'' had been completely massacred and that the ''Castilus'' and V-19 starfighters were long gone. Commodore Thrawn stated that Ayer's orders for complete secrecy were no longer relevant in the face of their failure to reach the ''Sempre'' in time to save the Imperials aboard. Thrawn and Vanto boarded the ''Sempre'' to observe the carnage for themselves. Moving carefully through the ship, Thrawn observed that only a few of the dead had blaster burns while the rest appeared to have been brutally beaten to death. Studying the bloodstains on the walls, Thrawn noted several that appeared to have been written glyphs or attempts at words. Moving deeper into the ship, Thrawn sought to enter the troop quarters, but was blocked by one of Ayer's men. Curious what the Empire was hiding, Thrawn commanded the stormtrooper to stand aside, asserting that in order to deliver justice for the murdered [[soldier]]s, he had to see the contents of the troop quarters.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThe stormtrooper continued to insist that the room and its contents were classified. At that point, the Chiss commodore raised his voice, shouting in apparent anger for the stormtrooper to step aside. The trooper sheepishly complied. Vanto was surprised by Thrawn's uncharacteristic anger, but once inside the troop quarters, Thrawn explained that it had been a pragmatic choice to appear angry in order to cut the conversation short. The Chiss remarked to his aide that when an adversary grows accustom to a warrior's normal behavior, it could be tactically advantageous to disorient the adversary by acting in a different way than expected. Inside the room, Thrawn discovered what the Empire had been trying to hide: the ''Sempre'' had been used to transport [[Slavery|slaves]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nBack on the bridge of the ''Chimaera'', Thrawn met once more with Vanto, Faro, and Lomar to discuss the matter further. After Faro revealed that the attacking V-19s had destroyed the ''Sempre''{{'s}} shield generators, hyperdrive, and [[sublight engine]]s, Thrawn deduced that the intention of the attack had been to free the slaves, not to take command of the ''Sempre''. Focusing instead on the slaves, Thrawn asked what species the ship had been transporting, to which Lomar replied that he had used the ship's audio and the size of the restraints to determine that the slaves had been [[Wookiee]]s. Utilizing the Wookiee homeworld of [[Kashyyyk]] as a starting point and the ''Sempre''{{'s}} location as an endpoint, Thrawn and Vanto pinpointed the location of the Empire's secret slave-processing center as [[Lansend Twenty-Six]], an old Separatist [[staging area]] from the Clone Wars. Identifying the [[blood]] marking on the wall as a Wookiee clan symbol signifying defiance, Thrawn deduced that there was a [[saboteur]] on Lansend Twenty-Six and that rescued Wookiees and freedom fighters would attack there next in an effort to free more of the Empire's slaves. Determined to defend Lansend Twenty-Six where they had failed to protect the ''Sempre'', Thrawn commanded radio silence as the ''Chimaera'' approached the processing center.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nWhen the ''Chimaera'' arrived at Lansend Twenty-Six, the station had already [[Battle at Lansend Twenty-Six|fallen under attack]] by the ''Castilus'' and its [[squadron]]s of V-19s. Thrawn quickly deployed a squadron of TIE fighters to deal with the threat, ordering them to disable the ''Castilus'' without destroying it. He also ordered a signal be sent to the Empire's nearby [[Baklek Base]], asking for assistance. Next, Thrawn contacted Colonel [[Zenoc]] of Lansend Twenty-Six,\u00a0from whom the commodore learned that the saboteur had already been captured, and requested a holo-map of the station. Using the map to track the positions of the escaped slaves and attackers, Thrawn fired on the station, destroying sections of it to trap the escapees unharmed in [[section B-five]]. The threat within the station neutralized, Thrawn turned the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} attention back to what remained of the attacking frigate and V-19s.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Lansend_26_aftermath.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Insurgents and Wookiee slaves are rounded up after the attack on Lansend twenty-six.]]\nAs the battle drew to a close, Vanto approached Thrawn, asking him what would happen to the Wookiee slaves. Thrawn replied that the Wookiee slaves would be left with Zenoc on Lansend, prompting Vanto to express his discomfort with the idea of the Empire using slaves at all. Thrawn replied that it was entirely possible that they were actually indentured servants, prisoners, or had sold themselves into slavery voluntarily to pay off debts. Vanto questioned his commodore's rationalization of Imperial slavery, and Thrawn admitted that it was unlikely that the Wookiees were anything but innocent people captured as slaves. Thrawn concluded that the enslaved Wookiees' origins ultimately did not matter. In the commodore's eyes, the Wookiees were now Imperial assets and had to be treated as such, even as his tone hardened from discomfort.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Botajef Insurgency====\n{{Quote|This is Governor Quesl of the free system of Botajef. You have intruded into Jefi space.

The Empire feared that such declarations and insurgencies could lead to another [[Separatist Crisis]], and thus commanded Thrawn to put down the revolt by any means necessary before any other systems thought to act similarly. Setting course for Botajef immediately, Thrawn turned to Vanto, Faro, and Senior Lieutenant [[Pyrondi]] to discuss the matter further. Pyrondi offered her disbelief that Quesl would lead a rebellion without other star systems as allies, arguing that the planet's governor was well aware that the military might of the ''Chimaera'' alone could stop the world's rebellion dead in its tracks. Commander Faro replied that she feared that Botajef may just be the first of many worlds preparing to secede from the Empire. Thrawn listened to their theories without offering any of his own, listening intently as Pyrondi described to him the follower nature of the native [[Jefi]] people. Carefully noting the Jefies' tendency to follow anyone who presented themselves as a capable leader, Thrawn suggested that the best overall strategy may be to overthrow Quesl in favor of a new, non-insurgent leader. After the conversation ended, Thrawn retired to his quarters and left Faro in charge of the bridge.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn spent the rest of the fourteen-hour journey to Botajef in his quarters, studying Jefi artwork. Thrawn felt that the low-contrast sculpts showed a self-awareness of their shortcomings, whereas their tressiles depicted their belief in the stability of their political system. Indeed, that planet had a history of long periods of passive allegiance punctuated by short bouts of revolutionary violence.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nTwo hours prior to the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} arrival at Botajef, Vanto arrived in Thrawn's quarters to discuss his growing concerns about the mission. Vanto feared that the mission was a set up by government officials and High Command designed to make Thrawn look bad by either painting him as a war-crazed alien who wiped out a planet of innocent followers or as a coward unable to defeat the [[Botajef Defense Force]] and forced to retreat. Nevertheless, Thrawn felt confident that he would be able to avoid falling into such a trap. Vanto warned that, in the event of failure, Thrawn and he might be demoted to commanding an ore carrier like their former commander Filia Rossi's previous assignment. Nevertheless, Thrawn changed the topic.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Death_Star-RO_U_Visual_Guide.png|thumb|right|250px|The Death Star, the battle station project which Thrawn, Vanto and Nightswan had all taken an interest in. Each man had reasoned that a massive millitary project was the destination of the doonium and other metals the Imperial Navy had been buying in bulk, though none of them knew precisely what the project was at the time.]]\nThrawn brought up his and Vanto's investigation into the Empire's secret military project, which they speculated to be the destination of the doonium and other metals whose prices and supply had shown recent marked changes. Sharing his most recent research with Vanto, Thrawn revealed that he had deduced that it was a single large military installation on a scale the Empire had never before seen, and that it must be equipped with a hyperdrive. The Chiss commodore admitted to his human friend that he believed the project was a foolish waste of resources and expressed his belief that it would be wiser for the Empire to pour their resources into a more flexible and mobile navy of [[capital ship]]s and versatile starfighters. Hoping to check out the project for himself, Thrawn revealed to Vanto that he had used the vectors from the Wookiee slave ships and Rossi's doonium transports from [[Socorro]] to discover the likely location of the secret project's construction site. Thrawn told Vanto that once the opportunity presented itself, they would investigate it further.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn brought the conversation full-circle, returning to the insurgency on Botajef that awaited them upon exit from hyperspace. The Chiss commodore pulled up a hologram of Quesl declaring the [[Botajef system]]'s independence from the Empire. Pointing out Quesl's mannerisms, Thrawn noted that he seemed to be daring the Empire to respond with military force to quash his declaration of independence. He theorized that the capital would be heavily fortified and that Botajef's substatial [[planetary defense forces]] would be deployed to keep the ''Chimaera'' at a distance. Closing the holo, Thrawn and Vanto returned to the bridge to discuss strategy further.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nUpon arriving at Botajef, Thrawn discovered that his theory about the planet's defenses had proven correct. The planet was defended from space by two [[CR90 corvette]]s as well as five squadrons of V-19s dispatched from Botajef's [[north-polar base]] and two squadrons from its [[south-polar base]]. The [[governor's palace]] was fortified by five ground-based turbolasers. Confident in his ability to handle the situation, Thrawn ordered [[Starfighter Commander]] [[Yve]] to launch the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} complement of TIE fighters to perform flybys past the corvettes and to form a screen between the ''Chimaera'' and the V-19s. A moment later, Thrawn received a call from Quesl, who asserted that the ''Chimaera'' was invading Jefi space and was required to either vacate or be fired upon. Thrawn responded calmly, buying time by contriving a fictitious Clone Wars-era treaty which Botajef had supposedly signed at the end of the war. Thrawn told Quesl that his secession from the Empire was a direct violation of the supposed treaty. As he spoke, Thrawn watched the TIE flybys of the corvettes, noting that the starboard corvette slightly twitched as the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} TIEs drew near whereas the portside corvette did not react.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nHaving ascertained all the information he needed, Thrawn proceeded with his plan; ordering Yve's special unit of TIEs to destroy Quesl's groundside turbolaser placements near the governor's palace. Yve's bombing run on the palacial turbolaser batteries distracted governor Quesl. In the meantime, Thrawn navigated the ''Chimaera'' closer to the corvettes, capturing the starboard corvette in the [[Star Destroyer]]'s tractor beam. As the tractor beam drew the corvette in, Quesl gasped and stumbled over the hologram, confirming Thrawn's theory: Quesl and the valuable Jefi art were on the starboard CR90 corvette. The Imperial commodore had predicted that Quesl had staged the system's insurrection and secession to facilitate his theft and illicit sale of valuable Jefi artworks. The governor had intended for Thrawn to destroy the palace to conceal the theft while he slipped away in the ensuing battle. Thrawn also revealed to Quesl that the flyby had revealed that the starboard corvette had a human crew while the portside corvette had a Jefi crew; he had surmised that Quesl was on the human-crewed corvette as it was unlikely that a Jefi crew would aid in the theft of their own art. Thrawn drew the corvette in, promising Quesl he would face trial for his actions before cutting the transmission. Ordering that the prisoners be apprehended and the art be returned to the Jefies, Thrawn commanded Vanto to inform High Command that the situation had been resolved.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Following his victory at Botajef among other successes, Thrawn was promoted to Admiral and Vanto to Commander.<ref name=\"Thrawn comic 4\">[[Thrawn 4|''Thrawn'' 4]]</ref>\n\n===Insurgency on Batonn===\n<!-- The section \"Insurgency on Batonn\" effectively covers the climax of the novel ''Thrawn'' and its immediate lead-up -->\n====Prelude to the battle====\n{{Quote|Destroying the island would also kill the hostages.

Inside the meeting room, Thrawn was greeted by Yularen, Donassius, Admiral [[Durril]] of the [[One Oh Third Task Force]], and Admiral [[Kinshara]] of the [[One Twenty-Fifth task force|One Twenty-Fifth]]. The planets of [[Batonn]], [[Denash]], [[Sammun]], and Lothal were deemed at-risk for the growing insurgencies against the Empire, and as such, their governors were present as well. Respectively, the governors were [[Restos]] of Batonn, [[Wistran]] of Denash, [[Estorn]] of sammun, and Pryce of Lothal. Taking his seat at the table, Thrawn listened as Yularen described the situation: a series of coordinated insurgencies had sprung up on the represented planets, indicating the potential for rebel cell activity. The Empire sought to prevent the rebel cells from coordinating, integrating, growing, or coalescing into a unified rebel movement.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nYularen moved forward to inform the admirals and governors that the Lothal insurgency was being handled by Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> He then briefed the officials present on the rebel activity on Batonn's [[Scrim Island]]. Colonel Yularen explained that the [[Scrim Island Imperial garrison]] had been overrun by [[Batonn insurgents|insurgents]] who had taken more than a hundred people hostage and seized control of the island's energy shield and [[ion cannon]]s.<ref name=\"Thrawn comic 4\" /> The admrials initially assigned Thrawn and the Ninety-Sixth Task Force to end the rebel activity on Batonn and Scrim Island. However, Yularen had incomplete information regarding which of the island's ion [[cannons]] were operational, and Thrawn noted that the available information about the island's defenses was inadequate for him to plan a guaranteed victory without endangering the Imperial hostages held by Scrim Island's insurgents.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThe Chiss admiral asked for more time to study the island's defensive capabilities so he could formulate such an ironclad plan without collateral damage. Fleet Admiral Donassius sharply cut into Thrawn at the notion, positing that they had no time to study the situation without taking action. Thrawn declined the assignment on the grounds that he refused to put the hostages' lives at risk. Instead, the Chiss admiral was assigned the pacification of an [[Battle of Sammun|insurgency on Sammun]], while the duty of retaking Scrim Island fell to Durril and the 103rd Task Force.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAfter the meeting, Thrawn and Vanto discussed the repercussions of Thrawn's decision to openly disrespect the assignments of High Command. Thrawn asserted with confidence that any detriment he had incurred in High Command's perception of him was a temporary setback, and he would soon recover their esteem and more. He was confident that the [[Battle of Scrim Island|attack on Scrim Island]] would go poorly for Durril and the 103rd; and moreover, that he would be asked to clean up Durril's mess and deliver success. Coldly disinterested in the impact Durril's impending embarrassment would have on the other admiral's career, Thrawn abruptly ended the conversation and spent the rest of the walk to the landing platform silently studying Sammuni art.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOnce he and Vanto reached the landing platform, Thrawn contacted Commander Faro aboard the ''Chimaera'', directing her to take the ''Chimaera'' and the Ninety-Sixth Task Force to Sammun. The admiral gave his first officer a strategy to swiftly crush the Sammuni insurgency, informed by the Sammuni artwork and culture he had just studied. Additionally, Thrawn requested that she detach the ''Arquitens''-class light cruiser [[Shyrack (Arquitens-class light cruiser)|''Shyrack'']] and Captain [[Brento]] from the bulk of the Ninety-Sixth Task Force for his and Vanto's personal use. Faro agreed to Thrawn's directives, promising to contact him once the Sammun insurgency had been defeated. Vanto expressed concern with Thrawn's choice to stray once again from his assigned mission, but Thrawn was calm in the face of potential backlash from High Command. He confidently asserted once more that all would end up as planned, informing Vanto that while Faro handled the Sammun job; they would be observing Durril's attack on Scrim Island. Donassius had ordered the Ninety-Sixth Task Force to pacify Sammun, but he did not specifically order Thrawn and Vanto to be present with the rest of the task force. Boarding the nondescript [[light freighter]] ''[[Slipknot]]'', Thrawn set course for Batonn.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Studying Scrim Island====\n{{Quote|First salvo away.

From the ''Slipknot'', Thrawn watched as the insurgents carried out their strategy and left Durril flailing. The insurgents' positions were protected by an energy shield that encompassed most of Scrim Island, protecting the island from orbital bombardment. The rebels on the island contracted the shield briefly to fire their ion cannons to incapacitate the ships of Durril's task force.<ref name=\"Thrawn comic 5\">[[Thrawn 5|''Thrawn'' 5]]</ref> Thrawn also observed eight small space freighters flying close to the sea between Scrim Island and [[Batonn's main continent]] to avoid detection. As he watched, seven of the freighters continued towards the continent while the eighth slipped off to space. Temporarily shifting his attention back to Scrim Island, Thrawn noted that the insurgents were in possession of a turbolaser emplacement that Yularen's intel had not mentioned.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nHis interest piqued by the freighter attempting to flee, Thrawn directed Vanto to hail it with a tight-beam comm signal before it could jump to lightspeed. Instructing Vanto to use the pseudonym \"Horatio Figg,\" Thrawn explained that he wanted Vanto to convince the insurgents on board that they were weapons smugglers. Posing as arms traders, Thrawn hoped they would gain access to the insurgents' base. The Chiss admiral was correct: the\u00a0smugglers aboard the escaping freighter provided Vanto with their base's coordinates.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn commanded Vanto to make the jump, leaving Durril and the 103rd to their fate. Vanto expressed unease with Thrawn's choice, but Thrawn assured him that he had already sent out a distress call on Durril's behalf and that he had seen more than enough of the Scrim Island insurgents' tactics to formulate a strategy of his own for the Ninety-Sixth's eventual deployment to Batonn. Leaving Brento and the ''Shyrack'' to track the movements of the seven freighters remaining on Batonn, Thrawn jumped to the coordinates that the eighth freighter had given Vanto.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Infiltrating the smugglers' starship====\n{{Quote|You were taken to their leader, I assume. Was it Nightswan?''\"<br />\"''Yes. You ''knew'' it would be him?''\"<br />\"''I didn't know for certain. But I suspected.|Thrawn and Vanto after escaping the smugglers' base|Thrawn (novel)}}\nAt the coordinates, Thrawn discovered a large Clone Wars-era [[Nomad (starship)|Nomad starship]] that the smugglers had set up as their mobile base of operations. Prepping Vanto for the infiltration, Thrawn removed his [[Imperial military uniforms|uniform]] tunic and shot it to make it appear as though Vanto had killed an [[Imperial officer]] and stolen his uniform. Additionally, he had affixed his old rigged lieutenant's plaque to the uniform, telling Vanto to press the tile closest to the center of his chest when the time comes. Promising to spend the time while Vanto is gathering information engineering their escape, Thrawn sent Vanto out to the smugglers and proceeded with his portion of the plan.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOnce Vanto had been brought to the insurgents' leader, Thrawn created a bomb out of gimmicked blaster packs, much like he had done years prior on the planet of his exile to gain access to the ''Strikefast''. Falsifying a [[radiation]] leak warning and hiding in the ''Slipknot''{{'s}} escape pods, Thrawn set off his bomb when a boarding party boarded the ''Slipknot'' to investigate the leak. Escaping the damaged ship in the confusion, Thrawn triggered the Nomad's abandon-ship alarm. Reuniting with Vanto in the frenzied chaos of the Nomad's repair bay, Thrawn led Vanto into one of the insurgents' freighters.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Infiltrating_the_smugglers_starship_SWT5.png|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn and Vanto discuss their successful infiltration of the smugglers' ship.]]\nSettling into the pilots seat, Thrawn explained to Vanto that he hoped that by stealing one of the insurgents' freighters they would be able to gain any data that had been left on the ship's [[computer]]. Inquiring about Vanto's time on the ship, Thrawn learned that he had surmised correctly that Vanto had spoken to Nightswan, and that Nightswan was the man behind the Scrim Island Operation. Having accomplished all that he could on the Nomad, Thrawn used the insurgent freighter to return to Batonn.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Reassessing the battle====\nArriving back at Scrim Island, Thrawn discovered that Durril had survived and with the help of Brento and the ''Shyrack'', had made it out of harm's way. The battle paused, Thrawn met via holographic projection with Donassius, Kinshara, and Durril. During this meeting, Kinshara reported his [[Battle of Denash|success on Denash]] while Thrawn reported the Ninety-Sixth's success at Sammun. Displeased with Durril's loss at Scrim Island, Donassius ordered Durril to take the ''Judicator'' and 103rd to the [[Marleyvane shipyards]] for repairs. Turning to Thrawn, Donassius asked how much longer Thrawn would need to study the insurgents before he could make an attack. Confident in his ability to handle the situation, Thrawn replied that he had already gathered the information he needed. With that, Donassius officially returned the Batonn Operation to Thrawn and the Ninety-Sixth. His new mission in hand, Thrawn prepared the ''Chimaera'' for battle.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Retaking Scrim Island====\n[[File:96th_Task_Force.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The ''Chimaera'' and the cruisers fire on Scrim Island's defenses.]]\nMoving into position around Scrim Island, Thrawn briefed Faro, Vanto, and the commanders of the ''Shyrack'', ''[[Flensor]]'', and ''[[Tumnor]]'' on the strategy he had come up with to deal with the insurgents. Ordering the three light cruisers into position, Thrawn watched as they bombarded Scrim Island's shields before being disabled by the island's previously unseen fourth ion cannon. Thrawn, however, was not surprised by the fourth ion cannon and had built his strategy around it. Speaking to Captain [[Yelfis]] of the ''Tumnor'', Thrawn learned that the cathtron tube of the fourth ion cannon was in the process of dying.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nMoving forward with his strategy, Thrawn began the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} descent towards Scrim Island, using the partially disabled light cruisers as cover against the ion cannons. Once the ''Chimaera'' reached optimal firing position, Thrawn opened fire, shooting into the ocean off Scrim Island's shore. Thrawn's gambit worked, sending a tsunami crashing into the western shoreline of Scrim Island. Firing at a second target in the sea, the ''Chimaera'' created a second tsunami that managed to hit the turbolaser emplacement. Alternating fire between targets one and two, Thrawn slammed Scrim Island with tsunami after tsunami until the water shorted out the island's turbolasers. Contacting the island, Thrawn ordered them to either lower their shields or risk the death of those operating the shoreline defenses. When the shields did not lower, Thrawn sent two more tsunamis at Scrim Island.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nFaced with destruction, the insurgents of Scrim Island lowered their shield and surrendered to Thrawn. Accepting their surrender with the terms that any further resistance would be met with lethal force, Thrawn directed Vanto to send word of their victory at Scrim Island to Coruscant. Humble in the face of Faro's praise, however, Thrawn admitted that there was more to be done before the battle for Batonn was over. Asking Faro to inform him when the island had been secured, Thrawn retired to his cabin.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Between the battles====\nSometime later that day, Thrawn hosted Pryce and Yularen aboard the ''Chimaera''. Settling into the Star Destroyer's conference room with Vanto and Faro, the group discussed the situation on Batonn's main continent. Thrawn revealed that he had discovered the location of the insurgents' stronghold to be the [[Creekpath Mining and Refining complex]] outside [[Paeragosto City]]. Thrawn then informed Yularen and Pryce of his plan to invade the complex via ground [[troop]]s as the complex was both shielded and home to 30,000 innocent civilians. Worried about her parents, Pryce suggested that she should go into the complex first to scope out the area and potentially take out the shield generator. Yularen explained further that Pryce would enter the complex with ISB [[Agent]] [[Gudry]] and tell her family that she was looking for a friend who got lost in the mines to gain access to the insurgent base. Thrawn was hesitant to accept Pryce's plan but ultimately conceded, knowing that he was likely unable to stop an Imperial governor backed by the ISB even as an admiral. Yularen went on to explain that they would send Pryce and Gudry in disguise to the planet [[Dennogra]] and have them take a [[planet hopper]] from there to Batonn. Though he was forced to accept the plan, Thrawn was vocal about his disapproval of it, thinking it to be both unsafe and dubiously effective. His feelings aside, Thrawn wished Pryce luck on her mission.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs repairs were conducted on the ''Tumnor'', ''Flensor'', and ''Shyrack'', Thrawn positioned them in a wide equilateral triangle around a hundred kilometers away from the ''Chimaera'', a strategic positioning that worried both Vanto and Yularen.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Parley with Nightswan====\n{{Quote|I see reality.

They would be cut down like grain in a field, their voices silenced before they were ever heard.|Thrawn and Nightswan|Thrawn (novel)}}\nAs twilight fell on Paeragosto City, Thrawn sat in his office aboard the ''Chimaera'' surrounded by holograms of Batonnese art. Even as he studied the art as always, Thrawn felt the pressure of each passing moment, knowing that his time with Nightswan was rapidly approaching its end. Keying a comm frequency that he had discovered aboard the stolen freighter, Thrawn contacted the insurgents as requested to speak with Nightswan. Once Nightswan was on the comm, Thrawn requested a face to face meeting in the field two kilometers to the north of the Creekpath facility. Nightswan met Thrawn's request with caution, prompting Thrawn to promise that his guards would stay out of firing distance. Additionally, Thrawn informed Nightswan that he was valueless to Thrawn dead or captured. His interest piqued, Nightswan asked Thrawn why the Chiss thought he would not try to kill Thrawn, to which Thrawn replied that he knew that Nightswan valued life too much to try to kill him. He asserted that his life was the only thing keeping the Imperials from destroying the Creekpath facility and killing the civilians inside because he was the only Imperial commander that would go out of his way to prevent casualties. Pained, Nightswan admitted that he had never wanted civilians to endanger themselves by living within his base. Thrawn revealed that he felt the same drive to prevent the deaths of innocents. After a pause, Nightswan agreed to Thrawn's invitation to parley in one hour.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nWhen Thrawn arrived at the field an hour later, he found that Nightswan was waiting for him. Nightswan mused that Thrawn could kill him at any moment, leading Thrawn to reiterate that he had no use for Nightswan dead. The two began discussing the ''Dromedar'' incident, Nightswan revealing that he was the reason that Thrawn had a Buzz Droid that day and Thrawn countering by revealing that he had two Buzz Droids; so even if Nightswan had not assisted, he still would have escaped. Shifting the conversation, Thrawn revealed that he knew that Nightswan was a part of the [[Mining Guild]], having deduced it from Nightswan's knowledge of precious metals and the fact that he had been to the Thrugii [[asteroid]] belt. In response, Nightswan revealed that his activism had begun when the Imperial demand for metals had led to him joining a splinter group of the Mining Guild dedicated to helping out the small businesses hurt by the rapidly forming Imperial metal monopoly. He went on to tell Thrawn that the corruption had eventually spread to the splinter group so he had set off on his own and become the [[mercenary]] Thrawn had met on the ''Dromedar''. Nightswan closed his speech by telling Thrawn that once he heard rumors of the Imperials' secret military project, he joined the insurgents. His interest piqued by the mention of the Imperials' secret weapon, Thrawn demanded to know everything Nightswan knew about the project. Nightswan, however, refused to divulge unless Thrawn joined him. Changing the subject, Thrawn learned that Nightswan had purposefully sabotaged the Cyphar scarn operation due to being strictly against spice and that Nightswan had never approved of the assassination attempts conducted by Higher Skies' indoctrinated recruits.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAfter another brief discussion about the military project, Thrawn complimented Nightswan's talents as a leader and tactician. In response, Nightswan revealed that he had tried to unit the rebel cells into a Rebel Alliance but distrust and infighting had prevented his plan from coming to fruition. Hoping for equal honesty from Thrawn, Nightswan asked him why he was perpetuating the Empire's evils. In a moment of honesty Thrawn revealed the truth of his situation to Nightswan, telling him about his meeting with the Neimoidians, the Chiss Ascendancy's plans for the Empire, and that he had completely faked his exile in order to infiltrate the Empire. Thrawn revealed that the Ascendancy had given him a single task: either use the Empire as an ally against the threats in the Unknown Regions or collapse them from the inside as easy prey. Discussing political ideals with Nightswan, Thrawn revealed that he believed that the Empire's tyranny was necessary to keep the galaxy in a state of order rather than chaos. The rebellion, he believed, would bring about a dangerous chaos that could allow the threat in the Unknown Regions to overtake everything. Taking a more optimistic tone, Thrawn reminded Nightswan that Emperor Palpatine would one day die and that when that day came there was hope that the Empire would choose a more tolerant and just leader.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Parley_with_Nightswan_SWT6.png|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn's parlay with Nightswan]]\nReturning once more to Nightswan's tactical prowess, Thrawn made Nightswan an offer the human had not expected. The Grand Admiral asked Nightswan to use his skills to aid his native Chiss Ascendancy in their battle against the evils far worse than the Empire. Furthermore, he promised Nightswan that if the people of Batonn put down their weapons, no harm would come to them. Believing Thrawn's promise to be impossible to keep, Nightswan declined his offer. He believed that he and Thrawn had the same vision for the future, but vastly different paths to get there.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nIn a final effort to get Nightswan on his side, Thrawn offered to take Nightswan to his deduced construction site for the Imperial project so that they might investigate it together. Nightswan was intrigued to the point of nearly agreeing, but once again found his obligation to the people of Creekpath forcing him to decline; he knew that surrendering would mean that the people would continue to suffer despite Thrawn's promises.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs he departed, Nightswan admitted that he knew his stand at the Creekpath mine would fail. Thrawn promised to order the soldiers to capture him alive, but Nightswan assured him that the soldiers would [[Death penalty|execute]] him anyway. Thrawn made one final attempt to save Nightswan's life by arresting him then and there, but Nightswan once more declined stating that he would hold to his ideals and protect his followers even if it led to his death.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs Thrawn watched him go, Yularen approached him from behind, threatening to shoot him as a traitor to the Empire. Having overheard none of the conversation that had occurred between Thrawn and Nightswan, Yularen demanded to know why the two had met alone in the field to talk. Thrawn was honest, openly admitting his intentions to recruit Nightswan to the Chiss Ascendancy. Accepting Thrawn's answer, Yularen returned to the matter of Thrawn's unconventional light cruiser positioning, and Thrawn explained that he had positioned the cruisers as he had in hopes of deterring any attempts by the insurgents to steal them. With this, Yularen was satisfied and the two briefly discussed Pryce's mission.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nNo longer seeing a reason to remain on Batonn, Thrawn and Yularen returned to the ''Chimaera'' to prepare for the remainder of the conflict.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====The Battle of Batonn====\n{{Quote|If any break off and run, let them go.

As time wore on and Pryce and Gudry failed to check in, Thrawn commanded Yularen to dispatch a special-duty squad to search Pryce's parents' house for Pryce, Gudry, or clues to find them.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThe ground battle accounted for and suspecting that the space portion of the battle would begin at any moment, Thrawn ordered Faro to prepare the ''Chimaera'' for combat. Even as he did so, ten mid-sized ships emerged from hyperspace and moved at attack speed towards the ''Shyrack'', followed shortly after by two more groups of eleven ships also targeting the cruisers. As the ships closed in on the cruisers, Thrawn calmly commanded the ground troops to send harassment fire in the direction of Creekpath.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n[[File:Thrawn_6_Batonn_Space_battle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Chimaera'' fires on the insurgent ships.]]\nAs the ships reached the cruisers, however, they passed them by without firing, heading in the direction of the ''Chimaera''. Thrawn remained placid in the face of the imminent attack, ordering the cruisers to free themselves from the repair barges so that the repair barges could release their stowed squadrons of TIE fighters. Using a combination of the TIE fighters attacking from behind and the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} turbolasers, Thrawn easily neutralized the threat of the mid-sized insurgent ships.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nOn the planet's surface, Gudry tried to evacuate Pryce without her parents. As a result, she murdered Gudry. To cover up her crime, Lothal's governor set off an explosion. Thrawn watched from the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} bridge as the explosion destroyed the Creekpath facility and consumed the civilian houses in the vicinity. Thrawn was disgusted and unnerved by the loss of civilian life, but strode to hide it. Thrawn attempted to maintain a calm fa\u00e7ade as he commanded his ground troops to enter Creekpath to act as a search and rescue team for civilians and insurgents alike. Faro reminded Thrawn that a few mid-sized insurgent ships remained. The admiral decided to allow those ships a chance to flee unharmed, destroying those who stayed to fight.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===Aftermath of Batonn===\n<!-- The section \"Aftermath of Batonn\" covers the falling action of the novel ''Thrawn'' and its setup for ''Rebels'' and the rest of the Canon Thrawn Trilogy. -->\n====Dealing with Pryce====\n{{Quote|Governor Pryce just left.

Not sure she's the right one for the job, though.|Eli Vanto and Thrawn|Thrawn (novel)}}\nIn the wake of the massacre at Creekpath, Thrawn held a meeting with Yularen, Pryce, and Vanto to discuss the events that had transpired. Thrawn and Yularen interrogated Pryce, asking her to explain the events leading up to the explosion. Pressing further, Thrawn asked Yularen to confirm Nightswan's death in the explosion. Yularen confirmed, and Thrawn silently reflected that the galaxy was worse off because of his death. Shifting the conversation, Pryce informed Thrawn that Emperor Palpatine was pleased with what had occurred at Batonn and, as if on cue, Faro signaled on the intercom that Palpatine requested his presence on Coruscant. The meeting over, Thrawn requested a word with Pryce once Vanto and Yularen had left the room.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nQuick to protect herself from the repercussions of her actions on Batonn, Pryce proposed a deal to Thrawn. In return for him dropping his Batonn suspicions and helping her with [[Phoenix Cell]] on Lothal, she would guarantee him Fleet Admiral [[Sartan]]'s job as the commander of the [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]]. Additionally, she promised to help him navigate politics, something that she considered to be his major weakness. Tempted by her offer, Thrawn agreed to consider it and allowed Pryce to depart the board room. Eighteen minutes later, Vanto returned and reported Pryce had departed before asking what they had discussed. After Vanto noted Thrawn's political adviser could be someone else, they both agreed she had likely played a role in the events at Creekpath, though they had no evidence to use against her. Clarifying that they would head to Coruscant, Vanto suggested Thrawn act grateful for his promotion, making Thrawn smile as Pryce had suggested the same. Thrawn then allowed Vanto to see if there was any remaining information groundside. When Thrawn expressed hope that Vanto and the others would get credit, Vanto doubted as such and stated he was content with staying his aide. Thrawn, however, then implied he could have a different future.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Promotion to Grand Admiral====\n{{Quote|Congratulations, Grand Admiral. An excellent day for you.

In the throne room, Palpatine presented Thrawn with a [[Grand Admiral uniform|new uniform]], a white one with gold shoulder bars and a silver collar insignia along with a rank insignia plaque indicating his promotion to [[Grand Admiral]]. Thrawn noted the Emperor's face held satisfaction with undertones of amusement and malice. Before he would take the promotion from the Emperor, however, Thrawn demanded to know about the [[Death Star]]. Thrawn explained that his concerns with the Death Star were twofold; he feared that Palpatine might use it against the Chiss and he believed that Palpatine was diverting too many resources that would be better served elsewhere into a single military project. Palpatine assured Thrawn that he had no plans to use the Death Star on the Chiss, mentioning that he had noticed that Thrawn had left the locations of Chiss worlds and bases off his maps of the Unknown Regions. The Emperor informed Thrawn that he did not begrudge the Admiral for seeking to protecting his own people by leaving their locations off the maps he provided. Additionally, he expressed complete confidence in the Death Star's ability to suppress all opposition, making it worth the cost. This said, Palpatine offered the Grand Admiral's rank plaque again and this time, Thrawn accepted.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs Thrawn accepted his rank insignia plaque, [[Darth]] Vader entered the throne room. As the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] approached, Thrawn analyzed Vader's confident gait, stance, and voice.

Gifting Vanto his [[Thrawn's journal|journal]], Thrawn directed Vanto to a set of coordinates in the Unknown Regions.

He attended a briefing with Pryce, Agent [[Alexsandr Kallus]] of the ISB, Konstantine and Grand Moff Tarkin, where they discussed that the rebels had attacked Mining Guild ships at the [[Sereeda Waypoint]]. Thrawn deduced that the rebels were planning an [[Mission to Reklam Station|operation]] on [[Reklam Station]] in the [[Yarma system]]. The Grand Admiral declared that he would pull the rebels apart piece by piece, ensuring that they would be the [[architect]]s of their own destruction. The Imperial garrison there was alerted to the potential rebel threat.<ref name=\"Steps Into Shadow\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the rebels' operations, they stole a number of Republic [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing starfighters]] that were left over from the Clone Wars. A group of rebel ships arrived to assist, and Thrawn allowed them to escape. While some officers, such as Konstantine, believed that these ships were the rebel fleet; both Thrawn and Pryce knew that there was a larger resistance movement growing in the galaxy. Both the Grand Admiral and Lothal's governor believed they could send a message to all the disparate anti-Imperial insurgent groups in the galaxy by destroying the rebel cell active at Reklam Station. Complete destruction of Phoenix Cell would intimidate other rebel groups and prevent a large alliance from forming, in the view of Thrawn and Pryce.<ref name=\"Steps Into Shadow\" />\n\nAt some point after his promotion to Admiral, Thrawn met the Imperial Governor [[Derantus]] who had purchased a counterfeit [[painting]] from the [[Trandoshan]] smuggler and [[thief]] [[Feresk Tssat]].

''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the completion of the [[Death Star]] to [[0 BBY]], meaning the TIE/D Defender program was initialized in [[2 BBY]].</ref> Grand Admiral Thrawn proposed an initiative to develop a new starfighter in the [[TIE line]] with improved offensive and defensive capabilities: the [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter]], known as the \"TIE Defender.\" Unlike most of the models of [[Sienar Fleet Systems]]' TIE series, the TIE Defenders would come equipped with deflector shields and a hyperdrive. Imperial Security Bureau agents had captured and interrogated renegade [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]] who sought to defect to the Rebellion. The agents' briefings showed that all the captured would-be defectors were reluctant to pilot fighters that lacked energy shields or hyperdrivers. As a result, the Defender would not only be more effective at defeating rebel fighters, but also increase loyalty among Imperial pilots.<ref name=\"TIE Owners' Manual\">''[[TIE Fighter Owners' Workshop Manual]]''</ref>\n\nThrawn petitioned Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin for authorization to develop his proposed TIE Defenders. The Outer Rim governor held the view that unshielded TIE fighters, which were cheap to manufacture and reduced pilots' independence, were a more economical means of maintaining control over TIE pilots. Nevertheless, Tarkin authorized Thrawn to proceed with the Defender initiative and meet with Sienar's engineers and designers at the [[Sienar Systems Advanced Projects Laboratory]] on Lothal. The Chiss Grand Admiral was heavily involved with Sienar's development of the TIE/D; personally submitting designs for some of the fighter's modules and components.<ref name=\"TIE Owners' Manual\" />\n\nThrawn's TIE/D Defenders were faster than any previously manufactured model of the TIE line, and computer simulations confirmed they would be faster than rebel Y-wings. Furthermore, the Defenders' wings angled away from the cockpit to give TIE Defender pilots a broader field of vision than TIE Interceptors provided. Some accounts from the Advanced Projects Laboratory recorded Thrawn bringing a rare [[Kamino saberdart]] to the ship designers, which he utitilzed to convey several of his proposals for systems and modules. According to those accounts; Thrawn used the saberdart to demonstrate the Defenders' proposed wing shapes and positions, the heightened speed and maneuverability TIE Defenders would have over other fighter craft, and the \"unparalleled\" visibility the design would provide TIE/D pilots. The heavy armaments of the defender, together with its high degree of maneuverability and speed, classified it as a fighter-[[bomber]].<ref name=\"TIE Owners' Manual\" />\n\n====Occupation of Ryloth====\n{{Quote|War.

But you&hellip; You were forged by it.|Thrawn to Hera Syndulla|Hera's Heroes}}\nAt some point after the mission at Reklam Station, Thrawn fought against the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] led by [[Cham Syndulla]]. The Empire had been cracking down on [[Ryloth]], the homeworld of the [[Twi'lek]] species, since the end of the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"Battles\">''[[Star Wars: Battles that Changed the Galaxy]]''</ref> While the planet was nominally called the \"Free and Independent Protectorate of Ryloth,\"<ref name=\"Lords of the Sith\">''[[Lords of the Sith]]''</ref> the Empire cracked down on the planet and gained control of more provinces over time. Unlike most Imperial commanders who merely sought to pacify Ryloth, Thrawn took a keen interest in Twi'lek culture. By studying Twi'lek art, culture, and history, the Grand Admiral was better able to counter and defeat the forces of the Free Ryloth Movement than other Imperial leaders.<ref name=\"Battles\" />\n\nThrawn joined the occupation to counter the [[Ryloth Insurgency]] after the Spectres helped the Free Ryloth Movement secure a previous victory before capturing a [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier]], which they dubbed ''[[Phoenix Nest]]''. That rebel victory had persuaded the Empire to accelerate its plans for occupying Ryloth.<ref name=\"Battles\" /> The Twi'leks, who had found previous success fighting against the Imperial occupation of Ryloth under Captain [[Slavin]], underestimated Thrawn's abilities and battle strategies. When combating the Twi'leks, Thrawn used far more precise tactics compared to other Imperial officers Syndulla had encountered.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\">{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}</ref> Under the authority of Thrawn, the Empire began to forcibly bring the population to its knees.<ref name=\"Battles\" /> Knowing it was Syndulla's home, Thrawn established a base of operations on Ryloth in the [[Tann Province]], where he spent time studying their culture to better understand them.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\n[[File:Hera_meet_Thrawn.png|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn's first interaction with Hera Syndulla]]\nOne day, Thrawn spoke with Slavin in his headquarters inside the [[Syndulla residence]] about his security arrangements. Thrawn knew that Syndulla would come for her family's [[Kalikori]], a sacred relic in Twi'lek culture honoring the living and dead members of a clan. Thrawn and Slavin then ran into [[Hera Syndulla]], disguised as a servant who tried to steal the Kalikori. The Imperial forces took Hera into questioning. There, Thrawn was able to deduce from the sentimental value of the Kalikori to a single Twi'lek family and the Syndulla family portrait that she was in fact Hera Syndulla, Cham's daughter and a noted rebel. Thrawn was also able to see that the [[scout trooper]] on guard was actually the Jedi [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]], whom he stunned. Slavin asked Thrawn how he knew that the trooper was actually a rebel. Thrawn stated that if trouble brewed, Bridger's fellow rebels would quickly come to his aid. After locking them up, Thrawn asked Captain Slavin to have the Kalikori transferred to his ship, which Slavin derisively called a \"piece of Twi'lek trash.\" Enraged at the philistine remark, Thrawn seized the captain by the front of his tunic in an uncharacteristic display of emotion, but released him after a moment and apologized for forgetting that not everyone appreciated art like he did.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nThrawn then went aboard an ''Arquitens''-class command cruiser and watched as Slavin oversaw a prisoner exchange between Syndulla and his daughter. However, Syndulla and the Rebels were able to escape from Slavin's forces by [[Second mission to Ryloth|detonating the Syndulla residence]], with a mildly impressed Thrawn watching from a distance. Thrawn then allowed the rebels to have their victory.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" /> As Thrawn's campaign against Ryloth continued, the Free Ryloth Movement found itself fighting without much help from the larger Rebel Alliance, just as it had before.<ref name=\"Battles\" />\n\n====Testing Konstantine====\n{{Quote|No, Admiral, I want you to handle it yourself.

After learning that a local rebel cell called the [[Iron Squadron]] had [[Skirmish over Mykapo|attacked]] an Imperial patrol with the help of the ''[[Ghost]]'', Thrawn deduced that the rebels were evacuating Mykapo's treasonous inhabitants. Curious about the Iron Squadron, Thrawn dispatched Konstantine to deal with the rebels there.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\">{{Rebels|Iron Squadron (episode)|Iron Squadron}}</ref>\n\nWhen Konstantine announced that he would depart with a full squadron, Thrawn insisted that the Admiral only deploy a single light cruiser. He reasoned that one ship would be sufficient for a man of his talents. The Admiral was unhappy but complied after Thrawn insinuated that he was not up to the challenge. Konstantine managed to trap the Iron Squadron's leader [[Mart Mattin]] and cripple his ship ''[[Sato's Hammer]]'' and attempted to use him to lure his rebel rescuers into a trap. However, the Spectres circumvented Konstantine's plan and managed to rescue Mart with the help of his uncle Commander [[Jun Sato]]. In desperation, Konstantine sent a call for reinforcements to Thrawn.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nThrawn arrived in his Star Destroyer shortly after the rebels damaged Konstantine's light cruiser. The rebels nearly collided with his ship but managed to flee under the ventral hangar. Speaking to Thrawn over the com, Sato vowed to meet him again. Thrawn replied in a similar fashion and allowed the rebels to escape. Thrawn then turned his attention to Konstantine and asked whether he had contacted him for assistance. Konstantine tried to deny it by claiming he had called to report that he had driven the rebels from the system. However, Thrawn realized that Konstantine was lying after seeing his blazing cruiser and noted that the planet's treasonous inhabitants had already escaped.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\n====Identifying subversives====\n{{Quote|When we find our spy, and we will find them, we shall turn them from an obstacle to an asset.|Thrawn on locating a possible Imperial spy|An Inside Man}}\nAfter a surge of defective vehicles at the Lothal [[Imperial Armory Complex]], Imperial High Command dispatched Grand Admiral Thrawn to investigate the presence of subversives at the factory. In fact, a [[Lothal resistance group|small rebel cell]] led by the former Governor [[Ryder Azadi]] had been infiltrating the [[factory]] and sabotaging vehicles. By that time, Thrawn had also initiated a new starfighter initiative to develop the TIE Defender, a starfighter equipped with deflector shields. Thrawn believed that this starfighter would contribute to the Empire's counterinsurgency efforts against the rebellion.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n[[File:An_Inside_Man_thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn addressing the Lothal factory workers]]\nIntelligence of the starfighter project was leaked to the rebellion. While not the full details of the project, this information led the Phoenix Squadron to send Bridger, [[Kanan Jarrus]] and the astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]] to spy on the factory and link up with Ryder's cell. The Rebel [[Infiltration of the Imperial Armory Complex|mission]] coincided with Thrawn's crackdown on the factory. After berating the workers for their poor craftsmanship, Thrawn forced the worker Morad Sumar to demonstrate how fast a [[614-AvA speeder bike]] could reach maximum speed. Sumar had earlier inspected the vehicle. Unknown to Thrawn, he was part of Ryder's rebel cell and a saboteur.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nThe speeder bike began to overheat and Sumar begged Thrawn to end the simulation. However, Thrawn was not satisfied and set the [[speeder bike]]'s engines to full speed. The faulty bike exploded and killed Sumar. Thrawn's actions horrified Bridger, Jarrus, the workers, Kallus and even [[Yogar Lyste]]. Thrawn took this as an opportunity to warn the workers that they would be personally testing every vehicle they built, expecting a substantial drop in the malfunction rate as a result. Thrawn then ordered Pryce, Kallus, and Lieutenant Lyste to question each of the workers. As a precaution, the Empire also jammed the factory's communication signals.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nHowever, Bridger and his [[Spectres|team]] managed to slip away and reach Section A2, which stored the blueprints for Thrawn's weapons. Meanwhile, Thrawn reassured Pryce that he had secured the chamber by ordering the sentries to shoot anyone trying to enter the facility without his personal code on sight. When Kallus expressed skepticism that Thrawn's new fighter initiative would make a difference, Thrawn responded that victory and defeat depended on the smallest details. He then ordered another worker to demonstrate his [[All Terrain Defense Pod]] (AT-DP) [[walker]]. When the walker collapsed, Thrawn gestured for his stormtroopers to arrest the man.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n[[File:Thrawns_Office_AIM.png|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn studying his enemies' art]]\nThrawn later summoned Lyste and Kallus to [[Thrawn's Office|his office]] at the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial headquarters]]. The office was decorated by holographic displays of the Spectres, [[Sabine Wren]]'s [[graffiti]], [[Mandalorian]] art and a [[Jedi Temple Guard]]'s helmet. Thrawn then showed his subordinates one of Wren's [[Starbird (symbol)|starbird]] graffiti paintings. While Lyste merely dismissed the painting as a retaining wall, the more perceptive Kallus recognized the [[starbird]] as a creature of light that had been re-appropriated as a symbol of the Phoenix Squadron. Thrawn deduced that the crew of the ''Ghost'', whom he had encountered on Ryloth, had a special connection to Lothal.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nWhen Thrawn inquired about their crackdown, Lyste informed the Admiral that two of the workers had disappeared following his speech and that they had left behind their uniforms. Kallus advised issuing an alert but Thrawn countered that the rebel infiltrators had already found new disguises and were after his secret starfighter project. Thrawn ordered Kallus and Lyste to secure Section A2 but the Rebels managed to escape the factory with the help of their secret informant, who allowed the rebels to escape on an AT-DP walker at the east gate's hangar bay. The Rebels' escape coincided with a diversionary attack launched by Ryder at the east gate.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nReasoning that the Rebel infiltrators would take advantage of the attack to make their escape, Thrawn ordered the [[AT-AT pilot]]s aboard the [[All Terrain Armored Transport]] (AT-AT) walkers \"[[Walker 271|271]]\" and \"[[Walker 414|414]]\" to attack the Rebel's stolen AT-DP walker. Despite the efforts of Thrawn, the Rebel infiltrators managed to escape with the stolen plans. Later, Thrawn heard a report on the skirmish from Lyste. Satisfied, he dismissed him and then turned to talk with Pryce and Kallus. Thrawn voiced his suspicions that the Empire had a mole within their ranks who was supplying the rebellion with information. When Pryce suggested questioning all Imperial personnel, Thrawn suggested setting up a trap for the traitor.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n====Strike on Lothal====\n{{Quote|Is Admiral Thrawn there?''\"<br />\"''We have reports of an increase in capital ships, but no confirmation.|Sabine Wren and Hera Syndulla about Thrawn's presence on Lothal|Visions and Voices}}\nUsing the information stolen by Chopper, Bridger, and Jarrus, Syndulla was able to plan a strike on the Lothal Imperial Factory. She planned to deploy a fraction of Phoenix Squadron and assigned Bridger to carry out reconnaissance work on Imperial military positions. When Wren asked if Thrawn was there, Syndulla replied that there had been an increase in Imperial ships above Lothal but that they did not know for sure. Syndulla was forced to relieve Bridger of his duties after he experienced a Force vision of the former Sith Lord [[Maul]] and attacked a Rebel crewman.

Under his command, [[E-XD-series infiltrator droid]]s were dispatched to Outer Rim worlds to search for the bases. One of these droids, [[EXD-9]], stumbled upon Chopper Base and was adopted by the [[Lasat]] [[Garazeb Orrelios]] and the [[RA-7 protocol droid]] [[AP-5]], who mistook him for a [[protocol droid]]. Kallus, using the pseudonym [[Fulcrum]], managed to warn Orrelios who disabled and reprogrammed the droid with the help of AP-5 and Chopper. The rebels then sent EXD-9 back to the Empire as an improvised bomb which destroyed an Imperial Star Destroyer.<ref name=\"Warhead\">{{Rebels|Warhead (episode)|Warhead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Star Destroyer, Thrawn met with Kallus aboard the ''Chimaera''. When Thrawn asked how the explosion happened, Kallus responded that he believed that the rebels reprogrammed the infiltrator droid to explode upon returning back to the ship. Despite the setback, Thrawn remained in good spirits because the incident greatly narrowed down the planets that could be housing the rebel base from a thousand to ninety-four systems.<ref name=\"Warhead\" />\n\n====Discovering Fulcrum====\n{{Quote|I believe Agent Fulcrum will prove far more useful to the Empire than Kallus ever was.|Thrawn reveals his discovery of Fulcrum's identity.|An Inside Man}}\n[[File:Thrawn_Sparring_TIE.png|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn sparring with specially-programmed sentry droids]]\nThrawn intercepted a transmission beamed out under the code phrase \"by the light of Lothal's moons\" and discovered that the rebel mole went by the codename \"Fulcrum,\" and that it was the reason for recent rebel successes. Thrawn and Pryce listened in on Fulcrum's next transmission to learn his true identity. Because only Imperial officers who were Sector Command staff or higher had access to the intel Fulcrum sent in the transmission, Thrawn realized that Fulcrum was not only a Rebel spy and an undercover saboteur but also a traitor to the Empire as well. To ferret out the traitor, Thrawn enlisted the help of the Head of the Imperial Security Bureau Colonel Wullf Yularen to screen the Lothal Sector's Command staff. Agent Kallus and Lieutenant Lyste were summoned to the ''Chimaera'', where they encountered [[Sector Command (Galactic Empire)|Sector Command]] staff en route to Thrawn's office. Kallus and Lyste encountered Thrawn as he was practicing hand-to-hand combat with a pair of [[DT-series sentry droid]]s, and then continued to the office and met with Yularen and Admiral Konstantine. Thrawn then met with the group and, along with Yularen, briefed Lyste and Kallus about the danger posed by Fulcrum. During the meeting, Thrawn also revealed that he had narrowed the search for the rebel base by analyzing Rebel attack patterns on Imperial installations and ships, and most importantly their proximity to the planet Lothal. When Lyste expressed his enthusiasm in hunting Fulcrum, Thrawn warned him that nobody was above suspicion.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\" />\n\nAfter dismissing his guests, Thrawn met with Pryce, who had come to inquire about progress in determining the Rebel base's location and the identity of Fulcrum. Thrawn told her he had set a trap by asserting that the Rebel spy in question was present for the meeting and that they now needed to wait for the spy to pass on the information they learned. Yularen then informed Thrawn that a coded message had been beamed off the ''Chimaera'' following the transfer of the shuttle thief that Lyste had apprehended above Lothal. Thrawn decided to visit the prisoner for himself.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\" />\n\nWhen Thrawn along with Pryce and Yularen arrived at the detention block, they discovered that the prisoner had escaped. After Yularen discovered that Lyste was the last person to access the detention block, Thrawn came to suspect that Lyste was the rebel agent Fulcrum.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\" />\n\nThrawn returned to his office and was informed by the stormtrooper sentry outside that Lyste was waiting inside his office. Already suspicious, he beckoned for two stormtrooper guards and cautiously entered his office. By this time, \"Lyste\" and Chopper had deleted the [[Atollon system]] from his charts and were hiding behind one of his exhibits to avoid detection. Meanwhile, Fulcrum reprogrammed two of Thrawn's [[sentry droid]]s into [[assassin droid]]s and set them to Thrawn's office. The droids entered the room and knocked out the guards. Thrawn attempted to disable the droids with the command \"Override Code [[Rukh]],\" but failed. Following a fierce struggle, Thrawn destroyed the droids by shooting them in their chests. Thrawn also caught sight of \"Lyste\" fleeing his office. Believing that Lyste had tried to assassinate him, Thrawn contacted Yularen and instructed him to proceed to the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} hangar bay.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\" />\n\n[[File:Yularen_and_Thrawn_TIE.png|thumb|left|250px|Yularen and Thrawn discuss the real Fulcrum.]]\nThe rebels managed to escape, but Lyste was arrested as Fulcrum. Following Lyste's arrest, Thrawn and Yularen interrogated him and quickly ascertained that he was not Fulcrum. Despite being aware that Lyste was innocent, Thrawn told Kallus and Pryce that Fulcrum was apprehended, before dismissing the two. In private, Yularen expressed his dissatisfaction with how easy the conclusion was made and how Lyste was too inexperienced and naive to be capable of what he's been accused of. Thrawn agreed with Yularen's assessment. They then analyzed the helmet the shuttle thief had left behind, which was inscribed with an [[artist]]ic depiction of a [[Loth-cat]]. Thrawn recognized the art style as belonging to Wren and identified Bridger as the owner of the helmet. When Yularen asked why Kallus did not report Bridger's capture, Thrawn concluded that Kallus was the real Fulcrum and had framed Lyste for the crime. Thrawn's plan was to manipulate Kallus into revealing the location of the rebel base in the Lothal sector.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\" />\n\n====Hunt for Mon Mothma====\n{{Quote|She could be our key to locating the true rebel fleet.|Grand Admiral Thrawn on the possible capture of Mon Mothma|Secret Cargo}}\nAfter Senator [[Mon Mothma]] resigned from the Imperial Senate and gave a fiery speech denouncing the [[Ghorman Massacre]] placing the blame upon Palpatine, Thrawn received intelligence that Mothma and the Spectres rebel cell were planning to travel through the [[Archeon Nebula]] to avoid Imperial detection. Based on his knowledge of [[Phoenix Leader]] Syndulla, Thrawn anticipated that Syndulla would be risky enough to travel through the [[Archeon pass]]. In response, he deployed his prototype TIE Defender, piloted by Imperial Commander Vult Skerris and escorted by two TIE Interceptors, to flush the rebels out of the nebula. Thrawn also tasked Pryce and Konstantine with positioning two Star Destroyers outside of the Archeon Nebula to capture them when Skerris drove them out. Despite Thrawn's planning, Syndulla and the Spectres managed to escape with Mothma and her entourage following a [[Operation Handoff|brief skirmish]] in the Archeon Nebula. Following her escape, Mothma and other rebel leaders formally established the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] above the planet [[Dantooine]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\">{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}</ref> The TIE Defender's deflector shields allowed it to endure the Archeon Nebula's ionized dust far longer than a standard TIE fighter would have.<ref name=\"TIE Owners' Manual\" />\n\n====Locating Atollon====\n=====Spy droids=====\n{{Quote|I believe this C1 astromech is the droid infiltrator Grand Admiral Thrawn referenced in his memo about the rebels of Phoenix Squadron.|LT-319 on capturing Chopper|Double Agent Droid}}\n[[File:ThrawnStarMap-AIM.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Grand Amdiral Thrawn sought the location of the rebels' Chopper Base in the Lothal Sector.]]\nAs part of his counterinsurgency efforts, Thrawn also utilized the services of a team of [[Imperial Information Office]] [[intelligence officer]]s based aboard an [[IGV-55 surveillance vessel]]. This team was led by Imperial [[Controller]] [[LT-319]] and were tasked with gathering intelligence and monitoring rebel activities. These individuals were fitted with [[AJ^6 cyborg construct]] implants and gave up part of their autonomy in the Empire's service.<ref name=\"Rebels Recon #3.19\">{{SW|url=video/rebels-recon-inside-double-agent-droid|text=Rebels Recon: Inside \"Double Agent Droid\"}}</ref> As part of their intelligence operations, these spies were tasked with keeping an eye out for rebel droids such as Chopper, who had taken part in numerous undercover missions.<ref name=\"Double Agent Droid\">{{Rebels|Double Agent Droid}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Spectre rebel cell's [[Mission to recover Imperial codes|mission]] to [[Killun Station]], LT-319's team detected Chopper's presence at the ISB base. Using a [[network terminal]], the team reprogrammed Chopper into a double agent droid and tried to use him to discover the location of Chopper Base. As part of the operation, Chopper hijacked the rebel ship ''Ghost'' and used a [[Computer spike|data spike]] to transfer data from the ship's navigation computer to the surveillance vessel. Before the download could be completed, the rebels retook control of their ship and removed the Imperial programming from Chopper. Syndulla then destroyed the surveillance vessel by sending back their data feed, causing a data surge that blew the vessel apart.<ref name=\"Double Agent Droid\" />\n\n=====Blockading Chopper Base=====\n{{Quote|I do not require glory, only results for my Emperor.|Thrawn's response to Kallus after he derided Thrawn for holding his capital ships|Zero Hour}}\n[[File:ThrawnDeathTroopers-SWRS03E21.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn arrives at the Imperial Complex flanked by his death trooper guards.]]\nLater, Thrawn acquired the services of a six-man [[Thrawn's guard|squad]] of [[death trooper]]s that became his personal guard.<ref name=\"Everything, Updated\">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> He flew his ''Lambda''-class shuttle to the Imperial Complex in Lothal's [[Capital City]] for a private meeting with Pryce and Konstantine. Inside the briefing room, Thrawn closed the blinds and warned them that they still had a traitor in their midst. He also initiated a hologram conversation with Tarkin and warned that the Phoenix Squadron and General [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group]] were planning to attack the TIE Defender factories on Lothal. While Thrawn had not determined the location of the Rebel base yet, he vowed to capture the Rebel leadership at Tarkin's request.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>\n\nAgent Kallus was listening to Thrawn's conversation and traveled to Bridger's [[LothalNet comm tower E-272|former home]], which had a [[transmitter]] which he had used to send his Fulcrum transmissions to the rebels. Aware that the traitor had listened in on the briefing, Thrawn followed him. When Kallus tried to inform the rebels, Thrawn startled him and revealed a communications jammer in his hand. Following a brief hand-to-hand scuffle, Thrawn managed to defeat the rogue agent, though Kallus destroyed his jammer and was able to warn the rebels. Kallus was taken captive by two death troopers and brought to Thrawn's command center. Thrawn coolly stated to Kallus that by looking at both the trajectory of General Dodonna's fleet and the agent's transmission, they pointed at a spot that was not shown on Imperial charts. Thrawn was aware that it was not on the charts, as it had been deleted by Bridger. However, the Grand Admiral examined the ancient art of the people in the sector and instantly discerned that the rebel base was in the Atollon system.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" /> The Grand Admiral incorrectly believed that the entire [[Rebel Alliance Navy]] was based on the planet [[Atollon]], which he placed under a blockade. Grand Admiral Thrawn sought to destroy all rebel forces on Atollon and cripple the Alliance's morale by delivering a crushing defeat.<ref name=\"Battles\" />\n\n[[FIle:Thrawn_addresses_Rebels_ZH.png|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn addresses the Rebels on Atollon.]]\nThrawn ordered Konstantine to blockade the Atollon system with the Seventh Fleet, cutting off any escape with two [[Interdictor vessel]]s. He then traveled to Atollon aboard the ''Chimaera'' with Pryce and the captive Kallus in tow. Thrawn then issued a hologram transmission to Syndulla, Sato, and Dodonna, stating that negotiations were off the table and vowing to crush them. The rebel fleet tried to break the blockade, but Thrawn's Star Destroyers and TIE fighters inflicted heavy casualties.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" /> Rebel Y-wings only inflicted light damage on the Star Destroyer ''[[Dark Omen]]'' commanded by Captain [[Corf Ferno]]. The Alliance had several [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]]s present above Atollon. While Nebulon-B frigates were formidable against enemy starfighters, they could not withstand sustained long-range fire from ''Imperial'' Star Destroyers. Several rebel Nebulon-B's were destroyed before they could organize a coordinated response to the Empire's blockade.<ref name=\"Battles\" />\n\nThe rebels only managed to find a gap in Thrawn's blockade after Konstantine disobeyed orders to intercept Sato's ''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier ''Phoenix Nest'' in an attempt to gain personal glory. Sato rammed his ship into [[Konstantine's Interdictor-class Star Destroyer|Konstantine's ''Interdictor''-class Star Destroyer]], destroying both vessels and allowing the rebels Bridger and Chopper to flee on a [[Kom'rk-class fighter/transport|''Kom'rk''-class fighter/transport]] into hyperspace. Thrawn witnessed the debacle and hoped that Konstantine's folly would not undermine his battle plan.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" /> Sato sacrified his own life and that of his cruiser-carrier to buy the young rebel Padawan time to escape and seek reinforcements. In the mean time, General Dodonna ordered the remaining rebel forces to retreat to Atollon's surface.<ref name=\"Battles\" />\n\n=====The ground assault=====\n{{Quote|You cannot see. But I can.''\"<br />\"''What? What do you see?''\"<br />\"''I see your defeat. Like many arms surrounding you in a cold embrace.|The Bendu and Thrawn|Zero Hour}}\nDespite this setback, Thrawn's forces had inflicted heavy casualties on the two rebel groups.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" /> Grand Admiral Thrawn nearly realized his goal of destroying the Rebel Alliance at the [[battle of Atollon]].<ref name=\"Battles\" /> After forcing the rebels back to the surface, Thrawn ordered his fleet to bombard Chopper Base from orbit. However, the rebels had activated Wren's prototype deflector shield generator,<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" /> which prevented serious damage from the [[orbital bombardment]].<ref name=\"Battles\" /> To give the rebels the impression that their shield could withstand orbital bombardment, Thrawn ceased the attack. He then delegated command of the Seventh Fleet to Pryce while he led the ground assault on Chopper Base. Thrawn deployed both AT-DP and AT-AT walkers for the ground assault.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nIn order to learn the rebels' strength, Thrawn sent his AT-DP walkers into the canyon leading to Chopper Base first. The walkers were destroyed by the former [[clone commando]] [[Rex]] and Orrelios' [[detonator]]s and a [[Missile launcher|rocket launcher]]. Thrawn then deployed several AT-AT walkers that were protected by shield generators. These walkers destroyed the remaining detonators, forcing the rebels to retreat. Thrawn and his death troopers then entered the base, while ordering his stormtroopers to advance.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nOne of Thrawn's AT-AT walkers managed to destroy a rebel [[GR-75 medium transport]] fleeing offworld. Thrawn and his troops then surrounded Syndulla, Dodonna and several rebels. When Syndulla refused to surrender, Thrawn threatened to kill them one by one beginning with Jarrus. However, Thrawn was interrupted by the mysterious Force entity known as [[Bendu]], who had arrived after being provoked by Jarrus. Bendu used lightning to destroy the base and strike down one of Thrawn's troopers and a walker. This gave the rebels the window needed to flee into space with their comrades.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n[[File:Thrawn_Bendu_ZH.png|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn stands before the wounded Bendu.]]\nUndaunted by this new enemy, Thrawn ordered his soldiers to fire at the Bendu, effectively ending its rampage. Back in space, Bridger, Wren and their [[Clan Wren|Mandalorian allies]] were able to destroy the second Interdictor, allowing the remains of the rebel fleet to escape into hyperspace. While he was unable to capture the rebel leadership and crush the rebellion completely due to Konstantine's folly, Thrawn viewed the battle as an Imperial victory.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nFollowing the battle, Thrawn confronted the fallen Bendu. When Thrawn asked Bendu what manner of creature it was, the Bendu replied that it was beyond Thrawn's power to kill. The Bendu also predicted Thrawn's defeat, describing it as \"many arms surrounding you in a cold embrace.\" Undaunted, Thrawn attempted to kill the Bendu, but by the time he fired, it was already gone. Thrawn could still hear the Bendu's laughter ringing in the air. Meanwhile, the surviving rebels fled to [[Yavin 4]].<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle and because of Thrawn's victory, the Rebel Alliance had come to believe that they were not ready for open warfare against the Empire, and their mission to liberate Lothal would have to be postponed.<ref name=\"In the Name of the Rebellion\">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref><ref name=\"The Occupation\">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref> The battle was considered a crushing defeat for the Rebel Alliance; but the actions of Sato, Bridger, and Wren enabled some forces to escape and prevented a disastrous total rout.<ref name=\"Battles\" />\n\n====Alliance with Darth Vader====\n<!-- Present events of ''Thrawn: Alliances''. Needs expansion. -->\n{{Quote|The invasion is coming, Lord Vader. But I have now bought the Empire time to prepare.|Thrawn to Darth Vader, on the threat posed by the Grysk Hegemony to the Empire|Thrawn: Alliances}}\nFollowing the battle at Atollon, which Vader and Emperor Palpatine viewed as a failure on Thrawn's part, the Grand Admiral spoke with the Emperor and Vader on Coruscant. The Emperor was displeased with how some rebels escaped. Nevertheless, Palpatine considered Thrawn and Vader to be his two most useful servants.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nThrawn was tasked with traveling with Vader to the planet Batuu to deal with a [[disturbance in the Force]] felt by Palpatine. During their trip, Thrawn took multiple occasions to taunt Vader about him being the very same Anakin Skywalker he fought alongside on Batuu many years ago. After arriving above the planets surface aboard the ''Chimaera'', Thrawn and Vader took a shuttle down to the surface. They entered a bar and encountered a species called the [[Darshi]]. Following the [[Skirmish on Batuu|skirmish]], Imperial forces became involved in a [[Imperial\u2013Grysk conflict|conflict]] with the warlike Grysk species. Though Thrawn sought to serve both the Chiss Ascendancy and the Empire, he introduced himself to the Grysk forces by his full Chiss name \"Mitth'raw'nuruodo\". As Thrawn knew they always attacked the closer foe first, the Grand Admiral thus gave the Empire time to prepare. They also returned young Chiss girls who had been kidnapped by the Grysks to Admiral Ar'alani. These children were Force-sensitive navigators, and the Grysks had kidnapped them in an attempt to replicate this Chiss tactic. The children's fear was the disturbance Palpatine had sensed.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nHowever, Vader also spotted a courier ship, which the Sith Lord deduced belonged to the Chiss, escape, and saw that personal cloaking devices worn by the Grysks were the same in function as Thrawn's assassin, the [[Noghri]] Rukh. The [[Sith Lord]] told Thrawn he believed they were both of Chiss design, and Thrawn confessed it was a Chiss craft and that the devices were from his people. Thrawn claimed his message to the Grysks was still important to the Empire, though Vader questioned if the message was not to warn the Grysks away from them, but instead to warn the Chiss working with the enemy that the Grand Admiral knew about them. The Chiss officer answered by implying it could be both, though did not state if that was truly the case, and told the Sith about the political stirrings from when he had left the Chiss Ascendancy. Thrawn speculated the Aristocras had failed to settle their differences or that the Grysks had made deeper inroads to their culture than he had hoped. Thus, as Vader pointed out, Thrawn, despite having openly criticized the way the Republic had handled the Clone Wars, could soon be facing a civil war. Thrawn even speculated that, if the Grysks had gained control of one Chiss faction, the first actions of such a conflict had already begun and that the attempted closing of the border was to stop him bringing the Empire to interfere.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nStill, Thrawn promised Vader that, while he would eventually return to the Chiss Ascendancy, he would not take the ''Chimaera'' away to help his people. The Chiss cited his pledge to serve Emperor Palpatine, promising he would not leave until he had completed his service to the Empire by neutralizing threats to the Empire. Thrawn compared his service to the Emperor to his pledge to help Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars. When Vader again stated that Skywalker was dead, Thrawn said that he now knew, having come to believe that Vader was a mentally separate person from his old ally. After this, Vader, who had piloted a TIE Defender during the battle, complimented Thrawn on the starfighter, stating he would speak to Palpatine on behalf of the project. The Sith Lord also suggested several improvements to the craft, which Thrawn promised would be transmitted to the Lothal factory when they returned to Coruscant.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nAfter Lord Vader informed Emperor Palpatine of his support for Thrawn's TIE Defender project, the Sith apprentice submitted proposed improvements to the Defender to the Sienar Advanced Projects Laboratory on Lothal. Darth Vader recommended the new Defender should be faster and more heavily armed than the original TIE Defender, as well as have simplified controls for pilots. Sienar Fleet Systems named the new prototype the [[TIE/D Defender Elite]]. According to many Imperial pilots and sources within Sienar, the Defender Elite's speed and maneuverability exceeded nearly every other starfighter available in production at the time. Thrawn wished to mass-produce the TIE Defender Elite at Lothal's Imperial Armory Complex.<ref name=\"TIE Owners' Manual\" /> The first TIE Defender Elite prototype was tested by [[ace]] TIE pilot Vult Skerris.<ref name=\"TIE/D Elite DB\">{{Databank|tie-defender-elite|TIE defender elite}}</ref>\n\n====Civil war on Mandalore====\n{{Quote|Effective, yes, but you miss the true artistry of this weapon, Governor Saxon.

This [[Skirmish on Krownest|event]] saw the death of Governor [[Gar Saxon]] and all-out conflict engaged on Mandalore. Acting on the Emperor's behalf, Thrawn contacted Saxon's brother and successor as Governor, [[Tiber Saxon]], instructing him to end the uprising as swiftly as possible. Saxon assured Thrawn that he would succeed in ending the conflict and promised that he would unveil a new weapon prototype that would prove invaluable to the Empire.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\">{{Rebels|Legacy of Mandalore}}</ref>\n\nA short time after the weapon had been tested for the first time during a battle with Clan Wren, Saxon showed Thrawn, present via hologram, the efficiency of the [[Arc Pulse Generator]], also known as \"The Duchess.\" Thrawn was shown the successful test of the Duchess against Clan Wren's warriors, and asked how his brother would feel if he saw him using such a weapon. Despite being impressed by the Duchess's abilities to target the [[Beskar]] metal in [[Mandalorian armor]], Thrawn expected the range to be greater. Though Saxon tried to defend that he had managed to rebuild the weapon from what fragment remained, the Grand Admiral bluntly stated that Saxon could not use the Duchess to its fullest potential because he did not truly understand it.

Upon arriving, he was greeted by TIE pilot Vult Skerris who had promised to show the Grand Admiral the fighter's capabilities. During the visit, a TIE pilot caught Ezra off guard, causing him to be spotted by Thrawn and Pryce. Thrawn was surprised to see the rebels here, and ordered his Death troopers to secure the prototype, before watching the young Jedi's antics with vague curiosity and responding to Bridger's casual greeting with a dry remark, sounding unsurprised.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\">{{Rebels|Flight of the Defender}}</ref>\n\nEzra was merely distracting the Imperials for his friend Sabine, as she was inside the Defender Elite attempting to steal its [[flight data recorder]]. Seeing Ezra pinned down, she lifted off in the fighter and helped him inside before destroying most of the depot's parked fighters and even strafing the area where Thrawn was standing. Unfazed by the powerful bolts scorching the ground inches from him, Thrawn calmly stood his ground and fired up at the rogue fighter with his blaster even as his fellows scurried for cover until it went screaming over his head. The fighter then proceeded to blow up the shuttle Thrawn had arrived in and strafed the command tower before screeching off into the grasslands. Still calm, Thrawn dryly inquired if the debacle had been part of the aforementioned demonstration. Pryce offered to activate the Defender Elite's [[kill switch]], but Thrawn instead saw a perfect opportunity to test the ship's combat abilities and ordered Skerris to deploy three TIE Interceptors in pursuit.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\nAfter two of the Interceptors were destroyed in short order, Skerris surmised that Syndulla was piloting the Defender Elite. Thrawn stated that it was unlikely, as she would have destroyed all three Interceptors much earlier. When the Defender Elite's transponder was disabled, Thrawn noted that it has been done in record time and correctly inferred that Sabine was also aboard the Defender Elite with Ezra. In spite of the Imperials' failure to retrieve the Defender Elite's hyperdrive and flight recorder, Grand Admiral Thrawn considered the day's events a success for its original purpose: demonstrating the prototype Defender Elite's capabilities. He reasoned that Ezra Bridger was an unexceptional pilot and had been able to defeat three trained Imperial pilots because the TIE Defender Elite was such a formidable vehicle. Even though Vult Skerris had not been the one to demonstrate the prototype fighter's strenghts, Thrawn was nevertheless highly satisfied with the results. The Grand Admiral believed the Defender would give the Empire a decisive advantage against the Rebel Alliance<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" /> once mass-produced,<ref name=\"TIE Owners' Manual\" /> and authorized Pryce to activate the Defender Elite's kill switch. He promised her ground reinforcements to secure the crash site and help find Ezra and Sabine. However, a [[Loth-wolf]] led the young rebels to safety, so Thrawn's reinforcements were not able to locate Wren and Bridger.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\n[[File:Pryce_reports_to_Thrawn_FotD.png|thumb|left|250px|Pryce updates Thrawn on the missing Defender components.]]\nHaving secured the crash site, Pryce contacted Thrawn and informed him that both the flight data recorder and hyperdrive were missing from the wreckage. This led Thrawn to deduce that they would try to get the data to [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]], and so he dispatched his own personal agent, Rukh, to stop them. When Pryce protested that such help was unnecessary, Thrawn pointed out that the rebels' presence on Lothal and the theft of the Elite as testaments to the contrary. Despite Rukh's efforts, the rebels nonetheless escaped. Attaching the stolen hyperdrive to an aging [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]], Captain Hera Syndulla eluded Thrawn's massive blockade by jumping to lightspeed through the hangar of an Imperial construction module, leaving Thrawn visibly annoyed.<ref name=\"Kindred\">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>\n\nAfter Syndulla returned to Yavin 4 with the data recorder, the rebel leaders were reluctant to commit to an attack because of Thrawn's tactical brilliance.

Reasoning that the rebels would most likely target the TIE Defender factory and [[Lothal City fuel depot]] in Capital City, Thrawn contacted Governor Pryce and ordered her to shore up ground defenses. When the rebels on Lothal managed to destroy the anti-air batteries on the ground, Thrawn ordered Commander Skerris to join the fray and prevent any rebels from reaching the surface. Skerris, piloting a new TIE Defender Elite, destroyed two rebels in quick succession but was unable to resist pursuing the now General Syndulla after she revealed herself. Unable to match the Elite's speed, Syndulla instead headed straight for Thrawn's flagship, the ''Chimaera''.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\">{{Rebels|Rebel Assault}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thrawn_Rukh_RA.png|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn orders Rukh to capture any surviving rebel pilots.]]\nRealizing she was attempting to lure Skerris into a trap, Thrawn ordered him to cease his pursuit but was refused, as Skerris believed that he almost had her. Thrawn was disappointed by this and told his gunners to open fire, the blasts struck both Skerris' Defender Elite and Syndulla's X-wing, disabling their shields. Hera then damaged the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} targeting array, briefly hid in the smoke produced by the subsequent explosion, and fired on Skerris' now vulnerable fighter, damaging its wing assembly and sending it spinning into an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]]. The crippled light cruiser in turn then crashed into a Star Destroyer and sheared through its bridge tower, allowing the strike force to make a break for the planet surface. Before they were able to reach their targets, Thrawn had ordered the second wave of TIE fighters to intercept them, and they managed to destroy the entire strike force. Upon being informed that by Commander [[Woldar]] that several X-wings crashed in and around the Capital City, Thrawn contacted Rukh on the ground and ordered him to locate and capture any survivors, particularly Syndulla.

Upon his arrival, Thrawn met with Tarkin, Grand Admiral Savit, Director Krennic, and Emperor Palpatine (who attended via hologram). There, he listened to Krennic complaining about the [[gralloc]]s attacking power cables and couplers at a equipment transfer point for his Project Stardust, which was the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star station]] Thrawn had learned of. To settle the dispute between Thrawn and Krennic, Tarkin and the Emperor agreed to continue funding the Defender project if Thrawn dealt with Krennic's gralloc problems within one week, with which Thrawn agreed. During this time, Thrawn reunited with Eli Vanto, Admiral Ar'alani, and the Chiss, helping them combat a Grysk task force that had entered Imperial space. During the [[skirmish against the Third Fleet]], the Grand Admiral and Commodore Faro also defeated Savit, who was behind the gralloc crisis, as he had been using them to allow starships to disappear and steal components from the Death Star. After this and the Chiss [[Skirmish with Grysk warships|defeating]] a pair of [[Grysk warship]]s, Vanto learned that his numerical analysis assignment for the Ascendancy was in fact to discover patterns among the characteristics of Chiss navigators and their powers. Recognizing the vital importance of navigators to the Chiss people, Vanto finally understood why Thrawn had sent him away.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\nShortly afterwards, Tarkin and Krennic contacted Thrawn and [[Assistant Director]] [[Brierly Ronan]], a strong believer in and member of Project Stardust. Ronan, though initially conflicted on what to say, told the two officers that Thrawn had failed his side of the agreement, as he had technically not destroyed the grallocs. Despite this loss to the defender project, Tarkin claimed it would be a priority after the Death Star was complete. Before the conversation ended, however, Thrawn recommended that Darth Vader be assigned to Stardust, claiming Lord Vader was the only Imperial who could recognize and deal with all threats to Stardust. Tarkin agreed with Thrawn's idea, and, after the discussion ended, the Grand Admiral used this to force Ronan to join the Chiss. Ronan would have been unable to hide his contempt for Palpatine from Vader, and Thrawn felt the Imperial official would be useful in the Ascendancy's coming war against the Grysks.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n====Return to Lothal====\n[[File:Family-Reunion-and-Farewell.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Thrawn's return to Lothal]]\nThrawn learned that Governor Pryce had destroyed the fuel depot outside of Lothal's capital in an attempt to prevent the [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|rescue of Hera Syndulla]]. Though the resulting explosion had killed the rebels' leader Kanan Jarrus, it also crippled the Imperials by destroying all of their fuel on the planet, bringing the Defender program to an indefinite halt. Thrawn chastised the governor for having the audacity of holding a parade to hide the magnitude of the disaster. Cutting off her protests, the Grand Admiral coldly informed Pryce that he would deal with her upon his return to Lothal, but in the meantime, he felt that without Kanan's leadership, the rebels&mdash;particularly Ezra&mdash;would be aimless, and attack recklessly.

He was a brilliant military strategist, known for his anticipation of enemy attacks and his own tactical precision. He was known to speak at least six languages: Cheunh, his native tongue; Sy Bisti, Meese Caulf, [[Minnisiat]], and Taarja, which were trade languages used by the Chiss; and Galactic Basic fluently after joining the Empire. Despite swearing loyalty to the Empire,<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> he also remained loyal to the Chiss, believing Emperor Palpatine only commanded the loyalty of his actions. The loyalty of the Grand Admiral's heart and mind remained with the Chiss Ascendancy.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\nThrawn worked to perfect the art of war. He had respect for his enemies, believing that in order to defeat a worthy opponent, one must understand them in every aspect, including their history and philosophy. In particular, Thrawn had a strong appreciation for art, and he believed that studying it could allow him to delve into the psyche of the people of the cultures that the artists belonged to,<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" /> even though his study of art made him the target of many jokes in the Imperial Navy's upper ranks. The critics of the Grand Admiral falsely thought he just enjoyed beautiful pictures, while Thrawn's supporters knew it helped him learn enemy tactics.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" /> Other Chiss never understood Thrawn's ability to build detailed tactical knowledge from what was viewed to be insignificant or obscure details, but Thrawn believed anything in a species' art was important. To Thrawn, all threads tied together, every brushstroke spoke to him, and the light curves told the artist's story. While he knew that every artist was an individual, Thrawn knew that they were the product of a culture, so Thrawn could use art to begin to deduce the \"fundamental pattern\" of a species. He also could find the relationships between a species' art, culture, and military doctrine, which allowed him to anticipate and counter them on the battlefront.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===Respect for life===\n====Noted for his concern====\n{{Quote|All lives are important, and I resist the thought of standing by and watching two hundred possibly needless deaths.|Senior Captain Thrawn to Senior Captain Lakinda and Mid Captain Samakro|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\n[[File:Nevil_Cygni.png|thumb|left|250px|Thrawn respected his adversaries, including the insurgent leader Nevil Cygni, better known as \"Nightswan.\"]]\nThrawn had a strong dislike for civilian casualties, although during his service to the Empire he sometimes acquiesced to operations that harmed civilians. Throughout his service to the Chiss Ascendancy and the Galactic Empire, Thrawn sought not only to protect the civilians loyal to the regimes he served, but also civilians of other factions. His regard for the lives of civilians, including aliens, was noted by several individuals including Senior Captain Lakinda,<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> Lothal Governor Arihnda Pryce, and Commander Eli Vanto.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nDuring his service in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, Thrawn maneuvered to save the lives of civilians of other species on numerous occasions; even at times bending the Ascendancy's non-intervention protocols. During his service to the Ascendancy, Thrawn's primary loyalty was to his own Chiss people. As such, he typically had motives related to learning about threats to the Chiss when protecting civilians of other factions, but notably did not during the Stivic incident.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> During Haplif and Jixtus' plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy, Senior Captain Lakinda reflected with disdain that Thrawn had \"exaggerated concern\" for non-Chiss \"aliens\" for whom the Chiss Ascendancy had no business caring about. She had no doubt that Thrawn would intervene in a civil war in which the Chiss had no stake to try to stop the hostilities, and believed there would be negative repercussions for the Chiss's involvement in that war.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nWhile serving the Empire, Thrawn angered his captain Filia Rossi by saving the people aboard the ''Dromedar'' rather than saving all the tibanna gas in the hijacking of that vessel.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Later, during the skirmish against the Third Fleet, Thrawn promised the treasonous Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit that he would defeat the Third Fleet with no deaths in either Grand Admiral's command, and together with Commodore Karyn Faro, succeeded in doing so.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n====Respect for his enemies====\n{{Quote|I will seek to preserve all the lives under your leadership, combatant or otherwise, to the best of my ability.

Thrawn offered clemency to Nevil Cygni, known as Nightswan, and offered the rebel a position in his native Chiss Ascendancy, believing his adversary's skills would be of great benefit to his people. Thrawn sought in vain to prevent a mass slaughter at Batonn's Creekpath Mining and Refining complex by seeking his foe's surrender, promising Nightswan that he was the man's \"only guarantee\" that the civilians crowded within the stronghold would not be slaughtered, which other Imperials would be happy to do.

She violated her orders in doing so, but secured an Imperial victory over the rebel insurgents of that planet. Thrawn and Yularen suspected Pryce's guilt in the matter but could not prove it. However, the Imperial High Command on Coruscant saw the result as a major victory and did not mind the death of civilians. They promoted Thrawn, whom they believed responsible for the attack, to Grand Admiral for leading the major victory on Batonn. Thrawn had strong misgivings about accepting a promotion for an attack he abhorred and which he had not conducted or authorized. However, Pryce persuaded Thrawn into accepting the resulting acclaim by arguing that someone would command the Seventh Fleet, and very few other high Imperial officers would seek to minimize civilian deaths with that Fleet.

One such ally was Arihnda Pryce.]]\nFor all of his tactical skill, Thrawn was known to miss the political subtleties of situations. Thus, while he would focus on what outcome would create a victory, the outcomes of his actions had a habit of making politicians unhappy. Though Thrawn considered politics another form of warfare, Ar'alani believed Thrawn's failings in the category were a result of politics having constantly and easily changing goals and alliances. In contrast, military warfare was relatively straightforward, with changing alliances slowed down by the time it took to change battle lines. Though he claimed to be confident in his ability to master the field of politics, Ar'alani doubted his chances.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn often said things that were politically inexpedient, with no malicious intent. When Senior Captain Lakinda expressed her willingness to sacrifice her life if the skirmish above Hoxim should require it, Lakinda's first officer Mid Captain Apros protested. Lakinda told Apros and Thrawn that she would hear no objections. Thrawn told her he would not have raised any.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> Similarly, Thrawn made an unintentionally impolite remark to Wullf Yularen after the ISB colonel confronted Thrawn about his parlay with Nightswan. Thrawn complimented Yularen on the colonel's tactical abilities, saying they were equal to his protege Eli Vanto's. The Chiss admiral then added that he did not know whether Yularen also possessed Eli's acumen leadership.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n===Support for his subordinates and colleagues===\n{{Quote|Lieutenant Commander Laknym, do you feel qualified to handle secondary command weapons control?''\"<br />\"''Me, sir?

This support also extended to his superior officers when they were maligned or overlooked. This was observed by individuals including Eli Vanto,<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Supreme General Ba'kif, Mid Captain Samakro,<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> and Commander [[Kimmund]]. In particular, Kimmund noted that all of Thrawn's senior officers was intent on working together to perform their duties to the best of their ability, and knew this was because of Thrawn's leadership style. He noted that Thrawn never used his genius to humiliate anyone, and that he demanded results but never perfection. Thrawn cared about those under his command, even to the point of standing up to men like Darth Vader to defend them. Kimmund wished that Thrawn's leadership style would become the standard within the Imperial military, and believed that if that were to happen, the Empire would stand forever.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nThrawn did not want his subordinates and partners to take the flak for his failures, but was happy to share credit and acclaim. He often set his subordinates up for professional growth and development, even without their knowledge, as he did with Lieutenant Commander Laknym,<ref name=\"Greater Good\" /> Eli Vanto,<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> and Karyn Faro.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n===Toleration of insubordination in the name of victory===\n{{Quote|My apologies, Senior Captain.

Certainly you should know by now I consider results far more valuable than etiquette.|Caregiver Thalias apologizes to Thrawn for stepping out of line. Thrawn was unfazed.|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nThrawn cared more about results than etiquette. Thrawn was both willing to perform acts of insubordination to achieve major victories, and to permit such acts from his subordinates when they succeeded. When Caregiver Thalias went out of line during the Chiss Ascendancy's mission to Rapacc, Thrawn was pleased that Thalias succeeded in postponing the Magys from ordering the mass suicide of her people. Thereafter, he ordered all the staff of his ''Springhawk'' to act as though Thalias was a commanding officer on the vessel whenever the Magys and her companion were present, in order to maintain the illusion.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nThrawn also usurped command to achieve victory on at least two occasions during his rise through the Imperial Navy. First, Thrawn acted insubordinate toward Admiral Wiskovis in the aftermath of the ''Dromedar'' hijacking, which helped the Empire track the pirates and insurgents responsible. Later, Thrawn defied the orders of the incompetent Admiral Carlou Gendling during the battle over Umbara. There, Thrawn managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat at the battle over Umbara using his brilliance and his tactical skills. Thrawn hoped that his Captain Alfren Cheno would be given credit for the victory, allowing him to retire with one final glorious victory. Instead, Admiral Gendling lashed out at Cheno, believing the insubordination to have originated with the Captain. Thrawn was about to object and take the blame himself when Cheno told the Chiss that he saw great potential in him and he would take the fall to protect Thrawn and allow Thrawn to grow in the Imperial Navy.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nDuring the skirmish against the Third Fleet, Thrawn instructed Commodore Faro to declare that Grand Admiral Savit's TIE pilots had staged a mutiny against Savit over his treasonous actions, and encouraged the remainder of the Third Fleet to join them. In reality, the \"mutineers\" piloting the ''Firedrake''{{'s}} TIE's at that point were Thrawn's own death trooper guard, who had commandeered Savit's TIE fighters to appear mutinous. Central to Thrawn and Faro's victory over Savit was convincing Savit's forces, including Captain Gilad Pellaeon, to commit insubordination against their treacherous Grand Admiral. This demonstrated both Thrawn and Faro's brilliance, and their refinement of insubordination into a tactical weapon against their treasonous enemy.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n===Calm and respectful demeanor===\n{{Quote|Looks like you lose, Thrawn.''\"<br />\"''A momentary setback.|Ezra Bridger and Thrawn|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}\n[[File:Slavin_Thrawn_and_Hera.png|thumb|right|250px|Thrawn maintained a calm, respectful composure in all but the most pressing situations, even when dealing with his adversaries or enemies such as Hera Syndulla.]]\nThrawn's calm demeanor and suave sophisticated mannerisms masked his ruthlessness. Thrawn rarely wavered in his generally cool temperament, though at one point, he furiously grabbed Slavin by his uniform for regarding his collectible Kalikori as Twi'lek trash. He quickly regained his composure, however, and apologized to him for his emotional outburst.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" /> This display may not have been an emotional outburst, however, but rather a calculated tactic on Thrawn's part. In a similar incident years earlier, Thrawn had apparently shouted in anger at a stormtrooper refusing to listen, but as he explained to his aide Eli Vanto, he had in fact not been angry but had only broken his usual pattern of behavior, which he believed was an effective tool in dealing with people who would not listen to reason or change their normal pattern of behavior.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn was also polite and respectful, even towards his enemies, whom he generally tended to admire. Even when interrogating Hera Syndulla, he showed mannerly behavior despite their antagonistic relationship.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" /> Thrawn did not have a high opinion of Konstantine and once sent him on a mission to deal with the Iron Squadron in the [[Mykapo system]]. Thrawn set a test for Konstantine by ordering the Admiral to depart with only a light cruiser in order to test his mettle. Konstantine underestimated the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the rebels there. Thrawn was astute enough to discern that Konstantine was lying when the latter tried to save face by claiming to have driven the rebels from the system. In fact, Thrawn was aware that the rebels had already evacuated their sympathizers from the system.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nThrawn's respect for General Syndulla led him to visit her while she was being interrogated by Governor Pryce. While Thrawn regarded looking after her Kalikori as a sign of respect, Syndulla was insulted that her enemy would hold a valuable family heirloom. Thrawn believed that his TIE Defender project was a better investment than Orson Krennic's Death Star project and traveled to Coruscant to lobby the Emperor.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\n[[File:ThrawnPryceJarrusLightsaber-DUME.png|thumb|left|250px|Pryce's misjudged actions frustrated Thrawn greatly.]]\nThrawn's efforts to mass-produce TIE Defenders on Lothal came to naught when Governor Pryce destroyed the Lothal City fuel depot. Pryce, who sought to destroy the Spectres, damaged the TIE Defender factory and destroyed the fuel depot in the process. While Pryce managed to kill Kanan Jarrus, Thrawn believed that the loss of the TIE Defender factory outweighed the Jedi Knight's death. Frustrated with Pryce's incompetence, Thrawn resolved to deal with her when he returned to Lothal.<ref name=\"DUME\" />\n\nWhen Ezra Bridger's purrgil allies attacked Thrawn's Fleet and latched onto the ''Chimaera'', the Grand Admiral displayed fear, anger, and frustration. The Lothal Rebels' purrgil reinforcements marked a rare instance of Thrawn's strategy and tactics being bested. In the past, Thrawn could almost always anticipate his adversaries' tactics and counter them, making that battle stand out in his record. Before the arrival of the purrgil, Thrawn stated the rebels had only created \"a momentary setback,\" implying that the defeat may have been turned into an Imperial victory. However, the unexpected arrival of the purrgil halted any possible Imperial retaliation.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\nAfter briefly losing his composure in the purrgil attack, and even amid purrgil [[Limb|tentacles]], Thrawn accepted his fate and regained a steely resolve, telling Ezra that the same fate awaited him.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\n===View of morality and power===\n====View of necessary evils====\n{{Quote|Certainly the Empire is corrupt.

He viewed those traits as negative, but believed a strong, ruthless galactic government would be necessary to protect the galaxy from threats he called \"far more evil than the Empire, and far more dangerous to all living beings.\" During their meeting on Batonn, Insurgent leader Nevil Cygni asked Thrawn why he willingly served a tyrannical regime, to which Thrawn replied the strength of such a regime would be a necessary bulwark against evil threats to the galaxy. Cygni implored the Chiss Admiral, asking how long Thrawn would accept tyranny as a necessary part of Imperial rule. Thrawn replied that Emperor Palpatine would not live forever, and he believed his position as a senior officer would allow him to influence the choice of a successor who would be less tyrannical while maintaining defensive strength.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nDuring the two men's conversation, Thrawn revealed to Cygni the true purpose that led to his service to the Empire. Thrawn's native Chiss Ascendancy knew of dangerous threats in the Unknown Regions<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> including the Grysk Hegemony<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" /> and sought relations with other galactic powers as allies, bait, or both. The Ascendancy had deemed that the Republic which Thrawn had encountered during the Clone Wars would not be a suitable ally against those threats as they deemed it too weak, mired in bureaucratic processes, corrupt, and of disparate and clashing interests. Thrawn told Cygni that the Ascendancy needed to know whether the Empire that was \"rising from the ashes\" of the Clone War could be a better ally or bait. He explained that he had been sent on a simple reconnaissance mission, never expecting to be taken before the Emperor and made an officer in the Imperial Navy.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> However, Thrawn considered his new circumstances to be an opportunity to be of even more use to his native Chiss than his original assignment, and thought he could best serve the peoples of both the Ascendancy and the Empire in his Imperial Navy role.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n====Philosophy regarding peace====\n{{Quote|You realize, of course, that peace has several different flavors.

During his meeting with Nevil Cygni on Batonn, Thrawn explained his belief that a tyrannical but ironclad Galactic Empire was better equipped than a galaxy at war to protect life and liberties from such threats. Thrawn reasoned that if some of the threats \"far more evil\" than the Galactic Empire were to conquer the Galaxy, liberty and hope would be permanently extinguished. As such, he saw maintaining order in the Empire as serving the greater good of the peoples of the galaxy, even when the actions to maintain order meant tyranny. Nevertheless, Thrawn sought to minimize civilian and combatant deaths, which was a rare trait among Imperial officers.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nWhile leading the Chiss Ascendancy's ''Springhawk'' against the Nikardun conquests as a Senior Captain, Thrawn's bridge officers discussed a desire for peace. Thrawn appeared, asking how peace should be achieved. The Senior Captain presented scenarios that would count as peace but be unacceptable to the Chiss, including being destroyed or enthralled to a hostile conquering power. Thrawn noted that peace could be achieved in a number of ways, which could range from an alien conquest of the Ascendancy to Chiss conquest of others. He and his first officer Samakro eventually settled on the best method of ensuring peace, at least for their present situation, was to prove beyond any doubt that the Ascendancy could and would respond to attacks with overwhelming force.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n====Who deserved what====\n{{Quote|Who deserves what is irrelevant.

Intending to destroy Lothal, Thrawn collected Sabine's art, since he regarded her as a talented artist and believed that he was safeguarding her legacy. Similarly, he believed that all that ultimately mattered was not who had moral justification, but who had power. Thrawn believed that the Jedi had made a mistake doing what they believed to be morally correct at the cost of strategic soundness, ultimately leading to their [[Great Jedi Purge|near-extinction]] and the reduction of their ranks to \"poorly-trained children\" in hiding, such as Ezra Bridger.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\n===Relationships===\n====Ar'alani====\n{{Quote|Let's go someplace a little quieter, and you can buy me a celebratory drink.

The two Chiss trusted each other strongly, and Ar'alani viewed Thrawn as a brilliant and reliable subordinate officer to have at her side. As a cadet, Thrawn impressed Irizi'ar'alani, a Senior Cadet three years his senior, through his tactical insight by analyzing her art. He caused her to blush by correctly inferring that she was too honorable to play dirty tricks on him. After the rescue of the luxury liner by the ''Boco'' and ''Parala'', Senior Captain Ziara entrusted Thrawn with the truth of Csilla's fa\u00e7ade of habitation, a secret classified and off-limits to an officer as low rank as Thrawn; who was a Senior Commander at the time. Furthermore, she invited him to stay at her Irizi family homestead despite his membership in the Irizi's rival Mitth family. Thrawn initially resisted her offer, but she told him that her grandfather had been an avid art collector and he could examine his repertoire; to which Thrawn replied that she know how to exploit her enemies' weaknesses.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nFollowing her promotion to Commodore, Ar'alani and Thrawn continued to hold each-other in confidence and seek each-other's advice, including as to whether Thrawn should accept a rematching offer as a Trial-born of her former Irizi family. Once the celebration following her promotion was clear, the newly minted commodore invited her junior officer to buy her a drink and discuss their goals somewhere more private, touching him on the arm.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThrawn and Ar'alani maintained some degree of contact during Thrawn's time serving the Galactic Empire. The Grand Admiral sent his friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Eli Vanto to join the Chiss Ascendancy by rendezvousing with Ar'alani just after the Batonn insurgency.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Although Grand Admiral Thrawn told Darth Vader that he would eventually return to the Chiss Ascendancy once he had eliminated threats to the Empire,<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> Ar'alani felt bitter during the Grysk\u2013Imperial conflict that Thrawn had remained with the Empire for so long.

Irizi Syndic Zistalmu noted that Thrawn had been close with Thrass, even though Thrawn's Vagaari pirate operations had led to Thrass' death. Syndic Prime Thurfian viewed Thrawn with great ire, in part because he believed the Senior Captain's actions had led to Thrass' untimely death.

The General had long acted as a mentor, benefactor, supporter, and occasional detractor and critic to the younger officer. Well aware of Thrawn's controversial reputation among the Fleet by the attack on Csilla, Ba'kif nevertheless only trusted Senior Captain Thrawn to identify the threat to the Ascendancy who had massacred the unknown alien refugees at the edge of the Dioya system. Ba'kif knew Thrawn to be both brilliant and cocky, believing the Senior Captain's positive attributes outweighed his downsides, but nevertheless sought to mitigate the negative effects that Thrawn's adventurism, audacity, or political miscalculations could cause.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nWhen General Yiv sought to hunt and capture Thrawn and Thalias following the Primea diplomatic reception and Thrawn fell out of communication, Supreme General Ba'kif proposed safely extracting Thrawn from Primea before Syndics Zistalmu and Thurfian could berate the Senior Captain with accusations of negligence and interference in Garwian politics. The Irizi Syndic thought that Thrawn should be able to get himself out of that mess as he had gotten himself into it, but Ba'kif questioned whether that was truly what Zistalmu wanted. Mitth Syndic Thurfian, also present at the meeting, inferred Ba'kif's implicit warning: allowing Thrawn to find his own way out of trouble might lead to even worse political and diplomatic consequences for the Ascendancy than merely sending an official ship to retrieve him. Ba'kif advocated the direct approach of sending the ''Vigilant'' to pick Thrawn up at Primea, reasoning that there would be no problem as the Vak Combine had no quarrel with the Chiss Ascendancy.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n====Samakro====\n{{Quote|You don't like Thrawn, do you, Mid Captain?''

Mid Captain Samakro had only recently been given command of the ''Springhawk'' as a result of the Defense Hierarchy Council's disapproval of Thrawn's actions during the Vagaari pirate operations, and was furious that the fleet saw fit to reverse his fortune by reinstating Thrawn as the ship's commander. However, Samakro highly valued the chain of command and the orderly operation of his warship, so despite sharing Senior Commander Kharill's rage at what had happened; Samakro ordered the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} second officer to stand down and obey all of Thrawn's orders.

Thrawn informally mentored Samakro on tactical analysis over the course of the Nikardun conquests,<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> the Nikardun campaigns, and the Agbui plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy.

During Thrawn's mission to Batuu and Mokivj, Thooraki covertly watched over Thalias' Trials. At the top of a [[Unidentified mountain|mountain]] amongst the Mitth family's [[memorial staff]]s, he tasked Caregiver Thalias with looking out for Thrawn and helping the politically-challenged tactician assemble his friends and allies when the time was right.

Vanto was originally assigned to translate for and tutor the Chiss in Galactic Basic. Upon hearing Vanto's awareness of the myths of the Chiss and observing the cadet's analytical potential, Thrawn requested Vanto be assigned with him permanently. Although Eli Vanto initially resented being stuck with, and often in the shadow of, an alien from the Unknown Regions, Thrawn mentored Vanto in tactical analysis and made sure his subordinate received credit and acclaim. Over the course of their time together, Eli Vanto came to view Thrawn as a mentor and a friend, overcoming his initial xenophobia and indignation. Thrawn recognized untapped potential within Vanto, leading him to send his friend to serve the Chiss Ascendancy, where Vanto's talents could flourish.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAfter the Seventh Fleet's skirmish against the Third Fleet, Admiral Ar'alani revealed to Vanto what his true purpose analyzing numerical data had been. Eli'van'to's numerical genius had been applied to identifying the patterns in Chiss sky-walkers, and the human Lieutenant Commander might be able to discover ways to inculcate more or prolong their Third Sight. Upon learning that the very future of the Ascendancy's ability to navigate the Unknown Regions lie in his hands, Vanto felt ever more appreciative of both Thrawn and Ar'alani for entrusting him with such an important role in the Chiss Defense Force.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\n====The Emperor====\n{{Quote|Your thoughts are laid bare, Mitth'raw'nuruodo.

Over the course of his service to the Empire, Thrawn was often summoned to the Imperial Palace on Coruscant to discuss matters of the Unknown Regions with the Emperor directly.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThe Emperor found both Thrawn's knowledge of the Unknown Regions and his tactical genius extremely useful to his plans for Imperial expansion and pacification of insurgencies. After the Batonn insurgency was put down, the Emperor promoted Thrawn to the rank of Grand Admiral. Palpatine, who was secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious and [[Sith Master]] to Lord Vader, sensed Thrawn's fear that he may betray the Chiss and turn the nascent Death Star against the Chiss Ascendancy. Sidious, aware that Thrawn had been keeping the locations of Chiss Ascendancy planets secret from him, allayed Thrawn's fears by promising the new Grand Admiral that he had no designs against the Chiss.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> By shortly after the Battle of Atollon, Emperor Palpatine considered Thrawn one of his two most useful servants along with Darth Vader. When he sensed a disturbance in the Force emenating from the anguish of young Chiss ''ozyly-esehembo'' girls captured and enslaved by the Grysks at Batuu, he sent the men on as partners on a mission to investigate the disturbance. In doing so, Palpatine would also test Thrawn's loyalty to the Empire versus his own Chiss people and his Sith apprentice's ability to separate his present as Lord of the Sith from his past as the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nBy the time of Thrawn's skirmish against the Third Fleet, Darth Sidious had begun to question the Chiss Grand Admiral's ultimate loyalty. Indeed, Grand Admiral Thrawn had promised Admiral Ar'alani of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet that the ultimate loyalty of his heart and mind was to the Chiss, whereas Palpatine and his Empire only commanded the loyalty of his actions. Following the arrest of the treasonous Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit, Palpatine dispatched Thrawn to Lothal but ordered the Chiss to return to Coruscant for a long, private discussion immediately after putting down the Lothal rebels. By that point, the Emperor had begun to conceive of himself as ruling both the Galactic Empire and the Chiss Ascendancy, in spite of the promise he had made to Thrawn in the aftermath of the battle of Batonn.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\nThrawn's disappearance was considered a major setback to Emperor Palpatine, who believed Thrawn would have been perfect for the task of hunting down the rebel fleet following the Battle of Hoth. Because Grand Admiral Thrawn was gone, the Emperor tasked Darth Vader with the job, although Vader ultimately deligated it to Grand Moff Tarkin's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Ellian Zahra.<ref name=\"SW (2020) 8\" /> In spite of Thrawn's disappearance at the Liberation of Lothal, his knowledge continued to serve Emperor Palpatine's machinations; heavily informing the computers of the [[Observatory]] on the [[desert]] planet Jakku how to safely navigate the Unknown Regions and prepare for the Contingency and eventual formation of the First Order.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n====Karyn Faro====\n{{Quote|I presume you were unhappy to hear from Assistant Director Ronan that I had recommended against your appointment as commander of Task Force 231.''

She had been the first officer of the ''Chimaera'' when Thrawn was given command of that Star Destroyer, having the rank of commander at the time. According to Eli Vanto, prior to the Batonn insurgency, Commander Faro toed the line between overt insubordination and permissible behavior to her superior officer. Vanto further reflected that Faro was willing to publicly question Thrawn's comments in a manner he believed was unacceptable in the Imperial Navy.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nThrawn believed Faro was too talented to command [[Task Force 231]], instead recommending her to take charge of the [[Eleventh Fleet]]. Despite Faro only being ranked a commodore, Thrawn believed his human prot\u00e9g\u00e9e's talents would be wasted on anything less than command of a full Imperial Navy fleet.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n====Gilad Pellaeon====\n{{Quote|You have three [Star Destroyers] here at hand.

Upon receiving evidence of treason on the part of his commander Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit, Pellaeon chose Empire over his Admiral and demanded Savit surrender. Captain Pellaeon subsequently joined Thrawn's Seventh Fleet, as part of which he participated in the blockade of Lothal.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n====Nightswan====\n{{Quote|We have the same sense of duty, Admiral Thrawn.

Even though they were frequently at odds, Thrawn recognized that his human adversary had a strong sense of justice, duty, and service, as well as skills and knowledge that would be useful to his native Chiss Ascendancy. Thrawn surprised Cygni by offering to meet him covertly for an honest discussion on Batonn, where he offered the rebel a position fighting threats to the galaxy he described as \"far more evil\" than the Galactic Empire. Cygni, who had made it his goal to understand and subvert the Death Star project, considered Thrawn's offer before ultimately deciding his duty was to the combatants and civilians of the Creekpath Mining and Refining complex.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nWhen Cygni was confirmed dead by Thrawn's search and rescue troops in the aftermath of the battle of Batonn, Thrawn considered the galaxy to be a darker place without his adversary.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\n====Hera Syndulla====\n{{Quote|It is a pity our first encounter might well be our last.|Grand Admiral Thrawn, to Hera Syndulla|Hera's Heroes}}\n[[File:Heras_Heroes_thumb.png|thumb|left|240px|Hera Syndulla and Grand Admiral Thrawn frequently found themselves at odds.]]\nDespite serving on opposing sides in the Galactic Civil War, Thrawn maintained a cordial and professional respect for Hera Syndulla. He respected her piloting and tactical abilities, and believed her to be a shrewd and intelligent leader. After her destruction of her own family's home during a prisoner exchange on Ryloth, Thrawn accepted that the Imperials had been outmaneuvered and insisted that they should allow the rebels their victory, despite the protests of Captain Slavin.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n===A great military mind===\n{{Quote|Art mirrors the soul, from which tactics arise.

In fact, if one has a sufficient variety of art to study, one can extend and extrapolate to the strengths, weaknesses, and tactics of entire cultures.|Thrawn|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nThrawn was a seasoned military commander and accomplished tactician who was known to be thorough and respected by his subordinates.<ref name=\"Steps Into Shadow\" /> Thrawn wielded a [[RK-3 blaster|RK-3]] [[blaster pistol]] on some occasions, for instance when he stunned the rebel fighter Ezra Bridger, who had disguised himself as a scout trooper,<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" /> and tried to execute Bendu with it before Bendu disappeared.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" /> Thrawn also had considerable skill with hand-to-hand combat, often practicing with a pair of sentry droids. Thrawn used his combat skills to survive at least one assassination attempt by Kallus, who had reprogrammed his sentry droids.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\" /> During a mission on Batuu with Darth Vader, they both were attacked by Darshi, and Thrawn used a combat [[baton]] to \"disable\" them for integration. During the Clone Wars, Thrawn utilized a [[lightning gun]] to take out [[B2-series super battle droid]]s that had their armor covered in cortosis. The [[Marg Sabl]], a tactic Thrawn learned about during his time with Anakin Skyalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala during the Clone Wars,<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" /> was one of his best-known maneuvers by his time as a Grand Admiral.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n[[File:Grand_Admiral_Thrawn_DoR.png|thumb|right|220px|Thrawn was a master strategist.]]\nThrawn was physically fit and agile. He was adept at unarmed combat and was familiar with the limitations of Imperial Academy martial arts. Thrawn managed to defeat Kallus in unarmed combat. As a Grand Admiral, Thrawn was familiar with the various rebel tactics including the Danaan formation. To prevent the rebels from escaping, he reinforced the center of the Seventh Fleet with Konstantine's interdictor cruiser. While this tactic prevented the rebels from escaping, it came undone when Konstantine ignored Thrawn's orders and decided to engage Sato's flagship.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nAs a military commander, Thrawn devised a strategy to intercept and trap General Syndulla's X-wings. While Thrawn's fleet succeeded in wiping out much of the rebel assault force, his plan was undermined when Commander Skerris defied his orders to cease pursuing Syndulla and created an accident, which allowed Hera and some rebels to escape to the planet's surface. However, Thrawn had prepared a contingency force of TIE fighters which shot down these fighters, leading to Hera's capture.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\n[[File:Thrawn_Sparring_TIE.png|left|thumb|250px|Thrawn was an impressive fighter, with great skill in armed and unarmed combat.]]\nWhile Thrawn was an effective communicator, his plan to encourage the Emperor to support his TIE/D Defender project was fatally undermined when Governor Pryce destroyed Lothal's fuel supply in order to kill the Jedi Kanan Jarrus.<ref name=\"DUME\" />\n\nThough the rebels managed to capture the Dome and lure the Imperial garrison aboard, Thrawn devised a counter-strategy which involved Rukh and his Imperial forces sabotaging the Dome's shield generators. This enabled Thrawn to bombard Lothal's Capital City in a successful effort to force Ezra to meet him to discuss his unconditional surrender. As a commander, Thrawn maintained an iron resolve when confronting the rebels and preferred to set the conditions of the battlefield.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\nDespite his skills as a commander, Thrawn's strategy during the Liberation of Lothal was challenged by the rebel resolve to restart the Dome's shield generators and Ezra's ingenious contingency plan of summoning a pod of space-faring purrgil to attack and carry his fleet away into uncharted space, which was a plan Thrawn had no way of predicting.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\n===A great tactician===\n{{Quote|When I saw the size of the attacking force, I realized the best strategy would be to draw as many of them as possible away from the rest of our ships before they were able to inflict significant damage.''\"<br />\"''As well as drawing them into a tighter cluster that our gunners and targeting computers would have less trouble with.\u201d''\"<br />\"''Correct.

This led to him being considered a prodigy by General Ba'kif and Mitth family Patriarch Thooraki, among others at the Taharim Academy and the Chiss Defense Force. Thrawn demonstrated his abilities to invent tactics as early as his charge of cheating as a cadet at the Taharim Academy, where he invented a stealth maneuver he would later employ while investigating the dead Paccosh refugees in the Rapacc system. Thrawn was able to learn, predict, counter, and best his enemies' tactics after brief observation&mdash;either of the opponents in combat itself or even of their art, history, philosophy, and culture. From besting Senior Cadet Ziara at combat with soft-coat sticks after inferring her tactics from her sculptures of [[groundlion]]s, to understanding how to distract, feignt, and make vulnerable the Paataatus to turn the tide of Picket Force Six's attack on Nettehi, to recognizing that the Lioaoin Regime had allied with the Nikardun Destiny simply because of their unusual starfighter tactics and behavior upon hearing his name; Thrawn demonstrated supreme tactical capabilities as a Chiss officer.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nDuring his service to the Empire, Thrawn continued to uncover and exploit his adversaries' cultural biases and blindspots, including through their art, word choice, and actions. He traced the Culoss pirates to the Uba system by recognizing their slang in Sy Bisti, detected Botajef Governor Quesl's fa\u00e7ade of resolve against the abuses of the Empire, and uncovered the human colonists' conspiracy to grow scarn on Cyphar because Nevil Cygni had left him clues in the form of shellfish.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" /> Shortly before the end of the Lothal campaign,<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason date\" /> Thrawn was able to discern his fellow Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit's preferred battle tactics and orders for his Third Fleet by studying recordings of Savit conducting his orchestral compositions. The Chiss Grand Admiral saw so deeply into the human's personality and biases that he managed to instruct his Seventh Fleet on how to defeat Savit's Third Fleet, remotely, with no deaths and minimal damage to Imperial vessels.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\nAs a tactician, Thrawn sponsored a new initiative to develop starfighters that were equipped with deflector shields. He believed that this feature would give the Empire an edge over their rebel opponents, as he stated that even the smallest features can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Thrawn disliked incompetence and shoddy craftsmanship, personally engineering the death of rebel agent [[Morad Sumar]], whom Thrawn was at first not sure was a rebel agent, by forcing him to ride a faulty speeder bike. After Sumar's death, Thrawn informed the workers present at the scene that they would be personally testing each machine they built.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nThrawn was willing to take high risks, as shown when he dispatched E-XD infiltrator droids to hunt for the Phoenix Squadron's Chopper Base. Despite the loss of a Star Destroyer, Thrawn succeeded in narrowing the search for the rebel base from possibly thousands to 94 worlds.<ref name=\"Warhead\" /> Agent Kallus later tried to elude Thrawn's hunt for Fulcrum by planting clues that incriminated Lieutenant Lyste. However, Thrawn discovered Kallus' deception and decided to manipulate the traitorous ISB agent into helping him find the rebel base.<ref name=\"Imperial Eyes\" />\n\nWhile other Imperial commanders overlooked the threat posed by rebel droids such as Chopper, Thrawn kept a catalog on these droids, which he circulated to his intelligence operatives. This information enabled LT-319 to embark on an ambitious plot to hijack the ''Ghost'' and find the location of Chopper Base.<ref name=\"Double Agent Droid\" />\n\nIn an effort to find the location of Chopper Base, Thrawn set a trap for Kallus by revealing that his spies were aware that the rebels were planning to attack Lothal. Cross-referencing his knowledge of ancient art with the trajectories of Dodonna's Massassi Group and Kallus' Fulcrum transmissions, Thrawn deduced that Chopper Base was in the Atollon system. As a career officer, Thrawn was not interested in personal glory but was only concerned with yielding results for his Emperor. His interest in the bigger game irked Konstantine, who was only interested in personal glory. Thrawn was angered by Konstantine's incompetence, as his folly ruined Thrawn's chance of crushing the rebellion once and for all.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nWhen General Syndulla attacked Lothal with a strike force of X-wings, Thrawn unleashed the power of his Seventh Fleet on them. Despite using his ships to form a blockade, Thrawn's plan was undermined when Commander Skerris defied his orders to cease pursuing Hera's X-wing. Due to Skerris' insubordination, Hera was able to destroy his TIE Defender Elite, causing it to crash into an Imperial light cruiser, which collided with a Star Destroyer. This created a gap which allowed Hera and a few rebel pilots to land in Capital City. Thrawn was not worried that a few ships escaped his blockade, because many of the ships were destroyed, and Thrawn personally had a second wave which consisted of TIE fighters and turbolaser cannons.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\" />\n\nAs a tactician, Thrawn detected a flaw in Ezra's plan to trap the Imperial garrison in the \"Dome,\" a mobile Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility. With his army in a safe position, Thrawn used the ''Chimaera'' to bombard Capital City. Knowing Ezra's Jedi training made him put others first, Thrawn was willing to kill civilians and destroy buildings in order to force Ezra to meet him aboard the ''Chimaera'' to discuss his surrender.<ref name=\"Family&Farewell\" />\n\n===Gaining tactical insight from art===\n{{Quote|I wish I could explain it, Senior Captain. I can see it. I can understand it. But I can't really put it into words.|Senior Captain Thrawn tells Senior Captain Wutroow he can't explain his tactical insights from art and clothing.|Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising}}\nThroughout his service to the Chiss Ascendancy and the Galactic Empire, Thrawn was gifted at uncovering insights about societies, cultures, and individuals from the art, clothing, and architecture they produced, admired, and collected. These insights applied to understanding his adversaries' tactics in combat as well as tracing connections between groups that others could not. As a Mid Commander of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, Thrawn studied Senior Captain Irizi'ar'alani's sculptures and correctly discerned her baton combat style, thus besting her. Years later, Thrawn confirmed that the Rapacc system was the origin of the Paccosh refugees found dead in the Ascendancy's Dioya system because a mining station there had architectural similarities to the refugees' clothing. This was confirmed when he met living Paccosh aboard the station.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> Approximately 19 years after that,<ref name=\"Chaos Rising date\" /><ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason date\" /> Thrawn studied the way Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit constructed orchestral music performances. From that study, he was able to discern Savit's tactics in combat well enough for his Seventh Fleet to defeat Savit's Third Fleet&mdash;with no deaths, and without even being present to command his forces. Thrawn provided his correct predictions and instructions to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Commodore Karyn Faro, who led the Seventh to victory in the skirmish against the Third Fleet.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Treason\" />\n\n===Effective ground commander===\n[[File:GAThrawnSW_-_FA.png|thumb|left|275px|Grand Admiral Thrawn]]\nThrawn was an excellent ground commander. To test the mettle of the rebels, he orbitally bombarded Chopper Base. When it was still standing due to a shield generator, Thrawn decided to test their strength by sacrificing several AT-DPs. Thrawn was skilled at coordinating both his ground and starfighter forces and also preferred to lead his men from the front. As a scientifically minded man, Thrawn was unperturbed by mystical threats like Bendu, as seen when he used the combined firepower of his troops and walkers to bring down the mystical Force-being. Thrawn was not intimidated by Bendu and tried to destroy the Force-wielding being by shooting him with his blaster, only to be surprised and unnerved by his sudden disappearance and mocking laughter.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nAs a seasoned military commander, Thrawn advised Governor Tiber Saxon to capture Sabine Wren in order to utilize the Arc Pulse Generator's full potential. While impressed by the weapon's ability to incinerate Mandalorian warriors by reacting with the beskar alloy in their armor, he believed that Saxon did not know how to utilize the weapon's full potential.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\nDue to his combat experience, Thrawn was unfazed when Ezra and Sabine flew their stolen TIE Defender Elite inches above him. Maintaining a steely resolve, Thrawn instead fired back. Thrawn was not upset by the loss of the TIE/D Defender Elite prototype and instead used the rebels' theft as an opportunity to test the fighter's flight capabilities and weapons systems against TIE/IN Interceptors.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" /> Thrawn's growing frustration with Governor Pryce's inability to capture the Spectres and Ryder Azadi's cell and stop the theft of the TIE/D Defender Elite led him to dispatch the Noghri assassin Rukh to hunt down and eliminate the insurgents.<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quotetrans|Fortunately, Chiss uniforms are designed to absorb and disperse as much energy as possible.

He was also proficient with a lightning gun, which he utilized to destroy cortosis-armored B2 super battle droids during his mission to Mokivj with Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Also on Mokivj, Thrawn demonstrated proficiency with Padm\u00e9's grappling gun as well as Anakin's lightsaber.<ref name=\"Thrawn: Alliances\" />\n\nThrawn believed it was always worth \"taking precautions\" when facing uncertain situations; a belief which extended to his equipment. Prior to his mission to Primea, Thrawn knew he would have to steal a ship from the Vak [[spaceport]] to escape. He thus brought an aerosol of the \"sleepwalking drug\" tava mist to temporarily disable the pilot without causing permanent damage, as well as nostril filters for himself and Thalias to prevent the drug from affecting them.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> Years later during his service to the Empire, Thrawn brought the buzz droids he collected, repaired, and upgraded with a beckon call aboard the ''Dromedar'', which he used to rescue himself and others from pirate captivity.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs a Grand Admiral of the Galactic Empire, Thrawn was closely associated with his flagship ''Chimaera'', a modified [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] bearing a depiction of a chimaera,<ref name=\"Steps Into Shadow\" /> his adopted personal symbol.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Most of the Imperial leaders we see in the movies rule through a combination of fear and manipulation.

Having established the need for Force-sensitive navigators to travel safely through the Unknown Regions, Zahn expanded the notion to develop the Navigators' Guild and other groups of Force-sensitive navigators in the Chaos.
