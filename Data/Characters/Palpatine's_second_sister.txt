After the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] left the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], Palpatine slaughtered his family and the bodyguards using the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of the [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], leaving no survivors.\n\nPalpatine remembered the lifeless forms of his siblings slumped on the starship floor every time his Sith master, [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]], urged him to recall the murders in vivid detail as part of his training in the dark side.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']] {{1st|[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Palpatine family]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified nobility]]\n[[Category:Unidentified sisters]]"}}}]}}}}
