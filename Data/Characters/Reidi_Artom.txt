Additionally, she rediscovered the [[Cularin system]] (initially Reidi Artom VI) in [[232 BBY/Legends|232 BBY]].<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\n==Biography==\nReidi Artom belonged to a long-lived [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] [[Species/Legends|species]]. Her people generally stayed on their own [[Planet/Legends|planet]], something a young Artom did not understand. She loved excitement, adventure, and the thrill of exploration, so she escaped her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] early in her life. For years, she wandered aimlessly, working whatever jobs would allow her to get from one place to another.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nArtom gained her exploring vessel, the ''[[Trailblazer]]'', in a unique manner. After she stowed away on the [[scout vessel]], the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] came under attack. After the [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] was killed, nearly instantly, the ship was left floating in space. She made repairs and, after using the [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] to get to a [[Spaceport/Legends|starport]], [[Transponder code|registered]] the ship in her own name. In an effort to explore new [[Star system/Legends|systems]] and undiscovered space while getting paid for it, Reidi became a [[Scout/Legends|scout]] for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Although many scouts explored the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] or the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]], Reidi surveyed the [[Exploration Region]] to find planets that had been overlooked. She was credited with the renewed interest that followed her explorations in at least eight systems.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nDuring her first scouting in the Cularin system in 232 BBY, Artom visited the system from the outer to the inner planets. As such, she found the [[Almas Sith fortress]] in [[Almas]]; the [[Crystal Snare]] in the [[Cularin system asteroid belt]], and the mysterious lava-like creature of [[Rennokk]] in her second visit to the [[Moon/Legends|moon]]. She also befriended the [[Tarasin]] native species of [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] to the extent that she was taken to the [[Sacred Ch'hala Tree Grove]] &mdash; a honor that was bestowed to few outworlders since.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nArtom spent nearly twenty-five years charting the Cularin system. She and her crew were credited with founding the settlement of [[Gadrin]] on Cularin. She was last seen heading off to explore the Unknown Regions in [[207 BBY]]. Due to the length of her people's lives, as of [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]] it was believed that she could still possibly be alive and exploring.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nReidi Artom's impact was clear within the Cularin system, as time was measured on both [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] and [[Almas]] by the A.A. (\"[[After Artom]]\") time system. This time system measured its starting point at the discovery of the system.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nA 60 meter-tall statue of Artom stood in front of a museum dedicated to her in Gadrin; the statue was visible from [[House Hirskaala]],<ref name=\"TRW\">''[[The Resistance Within]]''</ref> and was used for a medal ceremony organized by [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Barnab Chistor]] of Gadrin in 31 BBY.<ref name=\"ARv\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref>\n\n[[Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren|Lavina Wren]], the Republic [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] for Cularin was rumored to be a distant descendant of Artom.<ref>{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20011206a_oblivion&c=swlfc|text=Cularin's Lady Senator, Lavina Wren|int=Cularin's Lady Senator, Lavina Wren|archivedate=20030803003114}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Cularin Presence]]'' {{C|Statue}}\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{C|Statue}}\n*''[[A Revelation]]'' {{C|Statue}}\n*''[[An Uneasy Peace]]'' {{C|Statue}}\n*''[[Find the Lady]]'' {{C|Statue}}\n*''[[Quarters]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Holes]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Philology]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Shadows in Green]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[At Your Service]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[In the Name of the Maker]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Cloak and Vibroblade]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Plea Bargain]]'' {{C|Statue}}\n*''[[The Eye]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20011206a_oblivion&c=swlfc|text=Cularin's Lady Senator, Lavina Wren|int=Cularin's Lady Senator, Lavina Wren|archivedate=20030803003114}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020124a_wren&c=swlfc|text=Senator Wren's Social Calendar|int=Senator Wren's Social Calendar|archivedate=20021001234337}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020725agalaxy&c=swlfc|text=A Changing Galaxy|int=A Changing Galaxy|archivedate=20030813173039}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlfalmas|text=Almas|int=Almas (article)|archivedate=20090603073011}} {{1stm}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030508republic|text=Long Live the Republic|int=Long Live the Republic|archivedate=20060314165340}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20031002cularin|text=Cularin at Night|int=Cularin at Night|archivedate=20090603045459}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040115manifesto|text=Reidi Artom's Expansion Manifesto|int=Reidi Artom's Expansion Manifesto|archivedate=20080503151205}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040318manifesto|text=Manifesto My Foot|int=Manifesto My Foot|archivedate=20080503151230}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040429memoirs|text=A Mother's Memoirs, Continued|int=A Mother's Memoirs, Continued|archivedate=20091016060254}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040325wisdom|text=Home of Wisdom|int=Home of Wisdom (article)|archivedate=20090603045407}}\n*''[[The Replacements]]'' {{C|Under ''Player Handout 1-D''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20050707ballcomers|text=All Comers|int=All Comers|archivedate=20090603045815}}\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|Under ''Gadrin''}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Artom, Reidi}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Near-Humans]]\n[[Category:Space explorers]]"}}}]}}}}
