Gramm was the [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] of [[Mos Taike/Legends|Mos Taike]], a small city on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:TemplateEntertainer.png|250px|thumb|Randomly generated depictions of Chastina Rile, including one male depiction deemed non-canon in ''Legends'']]\nChastina Rile was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]]. The game was shut down on [[December 15]], [[2011]]. Due to the nature of many older [[:w:c:swg:Quest|quests]] in ''Star Wars Galaxies'', the [[Species/Legends|species]] of Chastina Rile changed each time a player performed this quest. Under her spawn template, she would either appear as a [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Hair/Legends|haired]], brown [[Eye/Legends|eyed]] Human female, or as a yellow eyed female [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]]. The quest dialogue given by Gramm Rile established Chastina as his wife. Although Gramm Rile was a Human, it cannot be said with absolute certainty that the Human depiction of Chastina is [[canon]]. In the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[In-universe|universe]], it is not unheard of for Humans to mate with other species, including Twi'leks. Therefore, Chastina could have either been a Human or a Twi'lek.\n\nTargeting Chastina simply identified her as Mrs. Rile, yet Gramm Rile referred to his wife as Chastina in the quest dialogue. Therefore, the full name of Chastina Rile can be inferred. Furthermore, although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining her revealed her to be an [[entertainer]]. However, it should be noted that this was primarily due to game mechanics, as a result of Chastina being placed under the randomized entertainer spawn template appearance.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rile, Chastina}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
