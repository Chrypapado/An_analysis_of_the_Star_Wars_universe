There can now be no doubt that our prince has returned. All praises be to Denid, Crown Prince of Velmor!|Chozz Wardle|Velmor: Royalty and Rebellion}}\n'''Denid''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who took the throne of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Velmor]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], after a prolonged succession crisis. The elder son of [[King/Legends|King]] [[Lorac]] and [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Denira]], Denid survived a [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Great Revolt|coup]] in [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]] which aimed to put his younger brother [[Anod]] on the throne, surviving the next 20 years on the isolated [[Jungle/Legends|jungle]] world of [[Tantajoc V]]. Denid returned home in 3 ABY with the help of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] leaders [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], interrupting his brother's coronation and restating his claim&mdash;Denid fell in love with Organa during this time, and tempted her with an offer of [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]]. Denid's arrival on Velmor led to a series of [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] plots that resulted in Anod's death, and Denid soon took the title of King of a newly Rebel-aligned Velmor.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|No further, citizen! Would you presume to interrupt the coronation of your king?\"<br />\"If the king is a true leader, the presence of his people cannot be a presumption! But the point is moot, in this instance... for I am Prince Denid, son of Lorac, King of Velmor.|Prince Denid returns home|Star Wars (1977) 49}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Denid was born in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] and grew up as royalty on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Velmor]], the elder son of [[King/Legends|King]] [[Lorac]] and [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Denira]].<ref name=\"wotc\" /> Groomed to eventually take the throne as crown [[Prince/Legends|prince]], by the time he was 15 years old Denid had become betrothed to a young noblewoman named [[Loren (noble)|Loren]].<ref name=\"marvel49\" /> Denid was a teenager when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] rose to power, and in [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]], Imperial agents learned that King Lorac held rebel sympathies.<ref name=\"wotc\" /> In response, the Imperials stirred up a [[Great Revolt|riot]] on Velmor, where a mob stormed the royal palace and [[Death/Legends|killed]] Denid's parents&mdash;Denid was marked for death as well, as royal regent [[Zelor]] had made a deal with the plotters for Denid's weak-willed younger brother, [[Anod]], to ascend to the throne as an Imperial-friendly monarch.<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\nIn the face of an oncoming mob, Denid and Loren were saved by the king's trusted advisor, [[Jedidiah]], a [[Velmoc]] who had been a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] prospect in his youth. Jedidiah rescued the young lovers and took them a small escape craft, which only had a week's supplies and an inadequate [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] for the journey to come. Their poorly outfitted vessel crashed on the nearby [[Jungle/Legends|jungle]]-covered world of [[Tantajoc V]], an accident Loren did not survive. Jedidiah was also severely wounded&mdash;after pulling Denid to safety from the destroyed [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the Velmoc attempted to return to the craft to salvage supplies, only to be struck on the head by a piece of falling debris that caused serious brain damage. Although Jedidiah's traumatic injury sent him into a delusional mental state where he could only remember his lost dream of serving the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]&mdash;and his duty to protect the prince&mdash;Denid and Jedidiah survived for the next 20 years in a harsh, wild environment.<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\n[[File:DenidReturns.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Denid returns home to Velmor after 20 years in exile.]]\nDenid grew into a strong, capable man in his [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]], but a crucial date approached all the while: Velmorian tradition required 20 years to pass before Denid could be ruled dead, at which point his right to the throne would no longer apply and the crowd would pass to Anod.<ref name=\"wotc\" /> That deadline was scheduled to pass in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], as the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] between the Imperials and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] was reaching its height. With Anod's coronation approaching, Denid finally received a ticket off Tantajoc V when his long-crashed craft's faint distress signal was picked up by Rebel leaders [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], who saw Denid as a potential avenue to turn the [[Velm system]] to the Alliance.<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\nOrgana and Skywalker returned Denid and Jedidiah to Velmor in time to interrupt Anod's coronation ceremony, arriving only moments before the royal crown was to be placed on Denid's brother's head. So as to conceal the Alliance's involvement, Organa dyed her hair [[Color/Legends|blonde]] and claimed to be Loren, while Skywalker went under the disguise of a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named Korl Marcus. Denid's identity was swiftly confirmed, instantly prompting massive celebrations of the return of the rightful heir to the throne. Having developed feelings for Organa during their time together, Denid proposed [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]] to the Rebel leader, sharing a kiss that night with the woman he desired to be his queen.<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\nHowever, the forces that had pushed Denid into exile had no intention of giving up that easily. Under the guise of \"Marcus,\" Skywalker uncovered a plot from Anod, Zelor and Imperial [[Imperial Diplomatic Corps|diplomat]] [[Zeta Traal]] to assassinate Denid and \"Loren\" and keep Anod in line for the throne. Skywalker warned Denid and Organa of the Imperial plot the next day at the traditional [[Mrid Hunt]], although Anod still managed to get the drop on them and shot both of them with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] mistakenly set to stun. The ensuing firefight ended with Anod and Jedidiah dead and Zelor and Traal imprisoned, clearing the way for Denid to take the throne shortly after. Denid parted ways with Organa and Skywalker shortly after, the [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]ian princess amicably turning down his proposal, and affirming Velmor's new allegiance to the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I love you, Leia! Marry me and rule with me as my queen!|Denid, to Leia Organa|Star Wars (1977) 49}}\nDespite spending much of his life living in the wilderness, Denid emerged as the very picture of an ideal nobleman: strong, intelligent, charismatic, self-assured and well-spoken. A master huntsman and tracker, Denid grew into terrific physical and mental health in the jungles of Tantajoc V&mdash;examinations by Royal Physician [[Chozz Wardle]] indicated that Denid was even immune to the [[Velmoc flu]], which Wardle theorized he had contracted during his exile.<ref name=\"wotc\" />\n\nAnti-Imperial in his sympathies, Denid jumped at the opportunity to aid the Rebel Alliance, and fell in love with Rebel leader Leia Organa. But while Organa was flattered by his feelings, she chose her duty with the Alliance over marriage to Denid, and the two parted on good terms.<ref name=\"marvel49\" /> Considered to have the promise of a monarch to lead Velmor into a new golden age, Denid was skilled at the duties expected of the King of Velmor, becoming a proficient [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomat]] and developing a high level of capability with the traditional Velmor [[energy sword]].<ref name=\"wotc\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDenid first appeared in [[Star Wars (1977) 49|''Star Wars'' (1977) 49]], written by [[Mike W. Barr]] and released in [[1981]]. In the comic, he was illustrated by [[Walter Simonson]].<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 49|''Star Wars'' (1977) 49]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030306velmor|text=Velmor: Royalty and Rebellion|int=Velmor: Royalty and Rebellion|archivedate=20100224213014}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[King/Legends|King]] of [[Velmor/Legends|Velmor]]<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n|years=[[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]]&mdash;<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n|before=[[Lorac]]<ref name=\"marvel49\" />\n|after=\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kings]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Velmorians]]"}}}]}}}}
