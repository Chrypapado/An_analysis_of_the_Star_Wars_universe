Her family managed an underground [[Hydroponics/Legends|hydroponic]] garden on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], and bought most of their water from [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen Lars's]] farm. She hung out at [[Tosche Station/Legends|Tosche Station]] with [[Janek Sunber|Janek \"Tank\" Sunber]], [[Laze Loneozner/Legends|Laze \"Fixer\" Loneozner]], [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]], and Skywalker.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Camie2-MOSW.png|thumb|left|180px|Camie]]\nCamie was involved with Laze Loneozner, whom she eventually married when Luke Skywalker and Biggs Darklighter left Tatooine. Laze Loneozner built an illegal [[Podracer/Legends|podracer]] to sell in order to raise enough funds for a lavish wedding party for her.<ref name=\"InsideSWT\">''[[Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy]]''</ref>\n\nAfter the deaths of [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen]] and [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru Lars]], some of the locals believed that their nephew had murdered them. Camie Loneozner, having spent much time with him, didn't believe those rumors at all. After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], she told this to historian [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]] in an interview.<ref name=\"GG1\">''[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope]]''</ref>\n\nWhen [[Tagge Company|TaggeCo]] decided to test their [[Omega Frost/Legends|Omega Frost]] technology on Tatooine, they bought up a number of the local [[Moisture farm/Legends|moisture farms]]. The Loneozners took over the operations of the old [[Darklighter family|Darklighter]] farm and were hired by the Tagges to take care of all of the local properties.<ref name=\"MC31\">[[Star Wars (1977) 31|''Star Wars'' (1977) 31]]</ref>\n\nThe two Loneozners ran into Luke Skywalker when he returned to Tatooine on a mission for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]]. They feared that Skywalker might cause trouble and ruin their relationship with the [[House of Tagge/Legends|Tagges]], and so they reported him to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]]. However, Fixer Loneozner had second thoughts about turning in his old friend and decided to warn Skywalker about the Imperials, allowing the young Rebel to escape capture.<ref name=\"MC31\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:CamieLoneozner.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Camie]]\nCamie was portrayed by [[Koo Stark]] in ''A New Hope'', though her scenes were not used in the final film release. Her deleted scenes appeared in the first issue of the [[Star Wars (1977)|''Marvel Star Wars'']] comics adaptation of ''A New Hope'', and she also appeared in [[Star Wars (1977) 17|''Star Wars'' (1977) 17]] and [[Star Wars (1977) 31|''Star Wars'' (1977) 31]]. The lost scenes from ''A New Hope'' can be seen in ''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''.\n\nShe was portrayed by [[Stephanie Steele]] for the [[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars Radio Drama'']] on National Public Radio.\n\nHer name has sometimes been misspelled as \"Cammie\".\n\nAn action figure released by Hasbro in 2010 gave Camie the last name \"Marstrap\", a name that was once given to another of Luke Skywalker's friends, [[Windy Starkiller|Windy]]. Windy was later given the last name \"Starkiller\", which was considered canonical in the continuity of [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi|story=The Pit (short story)|stext=The Pit}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|text=''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi'', Second Edition|story=The Pit (short story)|stext=The Pit}}\n*[[Empire 8|''Empire'' 8]]\n*''[[Star Wars Journal: The Fight for Justice]]'' {{C|Identified as Cammie}}\n*[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' novel]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{C|Deleted scene}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{C|Identified as Cammie}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 1|''Star Wars'' (1977) 1]]\n*''[[We Don't Do Weddings: The Band's Tale]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Rebel Force: Renegade]]''\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 17|''Star Wars'' (1977) 17]] {{Flash}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 31|''Star Wars'' (1977) 31]]\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope|story=Camie's Story|stext=''Camie's Story''}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]'' {{Flash}}\n*[[Darksaber (novel)|''Darksaber'']] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Camie_Galaxy_2.jpg|thumb|110px| Camie in 0 BBY]]\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]''\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope]]''\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Screen Entertainment]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{CCG|set=Premiere Two-Player Introductory Set|cardname=Luke}}\n*{{CollectorCite|7|ComicScan|ComicScan: Luke-ing for Love in all the Wrong Places}}\n*{{InsiderCite|32|Rebel Pilot Reunion}} {{Imo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|35|Anchorhead: The Lost Scenes}}\n*{{CCG|set=Special Edition Limited|link=SpecialEdition-Light/large/camie.gif|cardname=Camie}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{FFCite|9|ELE1, ''Electrobinoculars''}} {{Imo}}\n*{{CollectorCite|7|ComicScan|ComicScan: Luke-ing For Love In All The Wrong Places}}\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2005)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Special Edition]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|94|You Said It, Chewie!}}\n*{{SWPM|set=Scum & Villainy|link=http://www.swpocketmodels.com/images/cardsv021.jpg|cardname=Biggs Darklighter}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 2]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|128|A Blu Hope!}}\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Vintage Collection|text=''Star Wars: The Vintage Collection''|pack=Camie Marstrap & Laze \"Fixer\" Loneozner|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/tvcEXC5_Camie-Fixer.asp|archivedate=20191230130530}}\n*{{DB|character|camie|Loneozner, Camie|archivedate=20100327223523}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2013 Topps Star Wars Illustrated: A New Hope|cardname=Back at Tosche Station|link=https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/87473/cid/6296469/2013-Topps-Star-Wars-Illustrated-A-New-Hope-2-Back-at-Tosche-Station|archivedate=20210908160720}}\n*{{Topps|set=2013 Topps Star Wars Illustrated: A New Hope|cardname=\"That's no battle\"|link=https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/87473/cid/6296474/2013-Topps-Star-Wars-Illustrated-A-New-Hope-7-|archivedate=20210908160310}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Camie Loneozner}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/11/photoreceptor20041117.html|text=Camie Closeup}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/12/photoreceptor20041201.html|text=Cool Reception}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/09/photoreceptor20040903.html|text=Wormie's Seeing Things}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2004/06/photoreceptor20040611.html|text=The Girl Next Door}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Camie Loneozner\n|es=Camie Loneozner\n|hu=Camie Loneozner\n|ka=\u10d9\u10d4\u10db\u10d8 \u10da\u10dd\u10dc\u10dd\u10d6\u10dc\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\n|nl=Camie Marstrap\n|pl=Camie Loneozner\n|ru=\u041a\u044d\u043c\u0438 \u041b\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0440\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Loneozner, Camie}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
