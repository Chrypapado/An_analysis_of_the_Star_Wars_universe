I like you, you aren't half bad for a human. I only make fair deals.|Vogga the Hutt|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Vogga''' was a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] crime lord operating on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta's]] moon, in the years following the [[Jedi Civil War]]. His business included managing shipments of fuel from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Sleheyron/Legends|Sleheyron]], the largest fuel source in that part of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] after the destruction of [[Peragus II]].\n\nHowever, Vogga was in competition with [[G0-T0|Goto]], the leader of the criminal [[Exchange]] organization on Nar Shaddaa. Goto tracked and intercepted Vogga's fuel freighters, rendering it impossible to trade the fuel. Vogga hired many [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] to kill Goto, but Goto refused to reveal himself publicly.\n\nIn [[3951 BBY]], Vogga met with the exiled [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Meetra Surik]]. Vogga agreed to ship fuel to [[Citadel Station]], the base of the [[Telosian Restoration Project|Project]] to restore the dying world of [[Telos IV|Telos]], if Surik stopped Goto from hijacking the fuel freighters.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|Vogga's sitting on the biggest supply of fuel in the Outer Rim, now that Peragus has been wiped off the charts.|A bith negotiator to Meetra Surik regarding Vogga's fuel shipping business|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nVogga was a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] entrepreneur and crime lord from [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]], [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Vogga's business included shipments of engine-grade fuel from [[Sleheyron/Legends|Sleheyron]], its largest source in that part of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] after [[Peragus II]].\n\nOver time, however, Vogga found his freighters being hijacked by the mysterious Goto, one of the [[Exchange]] crime lords. His dock manager [[Fassa (Twi'lek)|Fassa]] was forced to hold Vogga's freighters on Nar Shaddaa, further choking his business.\n\nThe intentions of \"Goto,\"&ndash; [[G0-T0]]&ndash;were simple: he thought that any deals with the Hutts would bankrupt the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He therefore made sure that the [[Telosian Restoration Project]] and [[Citadel Station]] relied on Peragus for obtaining fuel. Even after the Peragus Mining Facility had been destroyed, G0-T0 continued disrupting Vogga's business: he thought that, as tragic as the supposed destruction of Telos and Citadel Station could be, it was still a lesser evil for the Republic than striking a deal with a Hutt.\n\nTo get rid of G0-T0's influence, Vogga hired [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], in particular [[Hanharr]]. He also entered a deal with [[Visquis]], Goto's underling, promising him more power on Nar Shaddaa, if Visquis could lure Goto into a trap.\n\nEventually, [[Meetra Surik]]'s companions used the confrontation between Vogga and Goto to their advantage. When Meetra herself was caught by Goto, they changed the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''{{'s}} ID signature to that of one of Vogga's freighters; when the ship left Nar Shaddaa, it was immediately intercepted by Goto's cloaked yacht, allowing Meetra's friends to rescue her.\n\nFollowing the yacht's destruction, Meetra, on behalf of lieutenant [[Dol Grenn]] of the [[Telos Security Force]], struck a bargain with Vogga, who, with his business secured, agreed to ship Sleheyron fuel for the Telos reconstruction.\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nHowever, in order to gain an audience with Vogga, Meetra was forced to help Vogga's [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] majordomo by donning a [[Huttese slave-girl costume]] and accepting the role as Vogga's new dancing girl. Vogga found this very amusing, but during the dance Vogga fell asleep and his [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] were put to sleep with [[Juma Juice]] by Meetra, allowing her to escape with Vogga's more valuable belongings.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n== Personality ==\nNot much is known about Vogga generally, but he possessed a great hatred of GO-TO for hijacking his freighters, hiring almost any bounty hunter he could find to locate and kill GO-TO. This hatred seemed to extend to the Exchange in general, as he likened them to a \"Hutta fungus,\" and he was deeply annoyed by their disregard for the Hutts in their business practices, viewing them as upstarts to \"the true lords of Nar Shaddaa.\"<ref>Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords</ref> \n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the game, there are four more or less separate quests involving Vogga:\nMeetra can eavesdrop on the conversation between two [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] thugs in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] ([[Entertainment Promenade]]), and learn that people who get easily admitted to Vogga are those who mention G0-T0 or his elimination to him.\n\nYou can also eavesdrop on the conversation of two other thugs, ([[Nar Shaddaa Docks]]) and learn the way to sneak into Vogga's private 'treasure room' (a dancer to make Vogga sleep, juma juice to the kath hounds to put them to sleep as well).\n\nThe player can perform as a dancing girl (by convincing Vogga's majordomo of her skills), this is the first step of getting to Vogga's treasures, and/or of getting an audience from him without mentioning G0-T0, but it can be done independently, without hearing the hints of the above-mentioned thugs. The player can also perform after negotiating the fuel supply, as it is still the only way to raid the treasure room. You would also unlock the slave outfit.\n\nIf playing as a male character, Surik can persuade [[Brianna]] or possibly [[Mira]] to wear a metal bikini and dance in order to have Vogga fall asleep. The Twi'lek domo might suggest that [[Visas Marr]] dance (if she is in your party), but she will flat-out refuse. You can ask if Kreia could dance for Vogga, but it wouldn't be allowed due to her age.\n\nAfter being admitted (either by mentioning G0-T0 to the doorguard, or by dancing), you can negotiate about the fuel supply of Telos. The only thing Vogga wants in return is to eliminate G0-T0. Consequently, the sequence of events mentioned above is only one of the several possible ones.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vogga\n|es=Vogga\n|fi=Vogga\n|ru=\u0412\u043e\u0433\u0433\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
