We are rebels. Fighting for the people. Fighting for you.|Ezra Bridger|Call to Action}}\n'''Ezra Bridger''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Gender|male]], was a [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]], a [[Spectres|freedom fighter]], and a revolutionary leader in the [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|early rebellion]] against the [[Galactic Empire]]. He was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Empire Day]] in [[19 BBY]] to [[Ephraim Bridger|Ephraim]] and [[Mira Bridger]]. His parents' public criticism of the Empire led to their [[Prisoner|imprisonment]], leaving Bridger an orphan on the [[planet]] [[Lothal]] as a [[Youngling|child]]. He joined the rebel crew of the ''Ghost'' in [[5 BBY]] and was [[Jedi training|trained]] in the ways of [[the Force]] by [[Kanan Jarrus]]. Bridger's [[Force power|abilities]] grew quickly, and a [[Ezra's broadcast|message of hope]] he broadcast in the [[Lothal sector]] inspired a number of rebel cells to begin working together to fight the Empire.\n\nIn [[4 BBY]], Bridger learned that his [[parent]]s were [[Death|killed]] while attempting to [[Revolt in an Imperial prison|escape]] from [[prison]]. The young Jedi, already having struggled with his [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]], became more conflicted, coming to a head on the ancient [[Sith]] world of [[Malachor]] where he recovered a [[Sith holocron]] in the hopes of destroying the Sith. He also encountered the former [[Sith Lord]] [[Maul]], who hoped to make Bridger his apprentice&mdash;particularly once Bridger used the dark side to open the [[holocron]]. This briefly strained his apprenticeship with Jarrus, who was blinded by Maul on Malachor, but the two repaired their relationship and continued to progress as Jedi.\n\nWith his powers growing stronger, Bridger took on more leadership roles in the rebellion, including helping [[Captain]] [[Rex|CT-7567]] \"Rex\" and a surviving [[battalion]] of [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]] [[battle droid]]s make peace and bring a sense of closure to the unresolved [[Clone Wars]]. Bridger also came into conflict with [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], helped fellow crewmate [[Sabine Wren]] in her quest to reunite the [[Mandalorian]] people, and sought to find [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], whom Bridger believed was key to destroying the Sith.\n\nIn [[0 BBY]], Bridger managed to free his people from the Empire's control during the [[Liberation of Lothal]]. Towards the end of the battle, he and Thrawn were taken into [[hyperspace]] by the [[purrgil]]. This opening allowed the [[Lothal resistance group]] on the ground to free the planet by destroying the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial dome]]. After the fall of the Empire, Wren and [[Ahsoka Tano]] set off on [[Search for Ezra|a journey]] to find Bridger and bring him home.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\n{{Quote|I've been on my own since I was seven, okay? If I'd let myself believe my folks were alive, if I let myself believe they'd come back and save me, I'd never have learned how to survive.|Ezra Bridger|Gathering Forces}}\n[[File:Bridger_family.png|thumb|left|180px|A young Ezra with his parents]]\nEzra Bridger was born in 3258 [[Lothal Calendar|LY]],<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> on the [[Empire Day|day]] of the [[Proclamation of the New Order|inception]] of the [[Galactic Empire]],<ref name=\"Meet Ezra\">{{SW|url=video/star-wars-rebels-meet-ezra-the-street-smart-hero|text=Ezra, the Street-Smart Hero}}</ref><ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> and grew up on the [[planet]] [[Lothal]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]]. Hoping to make the galaxy a better place for him, his parents [[Mira Bridger|Mira]] and [[Ephraim Bridger]] set up public broadcasting transmissions to speak out against the Empire's harsh rule<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> in [[14 BBY]]<ref name=\"Star Wars: Galactic Atlas\" /> The Bridgers' anti-Imperial activities began years earlier, around [[18 BBY]]<ref name=\"Timeline\">In ''[[Adventures in Wild Space: The Steal]]'', Ezra Bridger is an infant. Since Ezra was born on the first [[Empire Day]] (which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' cites as [[19 BBY]]), the ''[[Star Wars: Adventures in Wild Space]]'' series (the books of which take place in close proximity to each other) must be set around [[18 BBY]].</ref> when Ezra was only an infant and his [[parent]]s gave shelter to [[Lina Graf|Lina]] and [[Milo Graf]], a pair of [[Youngling|children]] whose own [[Rhyssa Graf|mother]] and [[Auric Graf|father]] were abducted by the Empire. While the Graf children were in the [[Bridger family]] home, the infant Ezra's giggles drew the attention of Milo, who presented him with his finger to hold and commented that the baby was cute. According to Mira, at that age Ezra was cute when he was not screaming, which he was prone to doing as a baby.<ref name=\"Adventures in Wild Space: The Steal\">''[[Adventures in Wild Space: The Steal]]''</ref> Over the course of his early childhood, Ezra came to know multiple acquaintances of his parents, including the [[Rodian]] [[Tseebo]]<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> and Lothal [[Governor]] [[Ryder Azadi]].<ref name=\"Legacy\">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>  At the same time, his parents continued their broadcasts encouraging resistance against the Empire, however this would eventually cost them their own lives. By [[12 BBY]], his parents were found and taken away by the Empire,<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> leaving Ezra to live largely on his own for the next eight years and find work as a [[con artist]] and thief, stealing technology and reselling it on the black market, while unknowingly using [[the Force]] to occasionally get himself out of tough situations.<ref name=\"Meet Ezra\" /><ref name=\"Property\">''[[Property of Ezra Bridger]]''</ref> Eventually, he would come to live in the abandoned [[LothalNet comm tower E-272]], where he would keep a collection of stormtrooper helmets.<ref name=\"Property\" /><ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref><ref name=\"Ezra's Gamble\">''[[Ezra's Gamble]]''</ref>\n\nBridger would later be apprenticed to a [[Xexto]] named [[Ferpil Wallaway]], who was the owner of a [[Wallaway's Pawn Shop|pawn shop]] in Lothal as well as a skilled pickpocket who had various underworld connections. The Xexto taught the boy everything he knew, and they would try to pick each other clean for fun. The boy worked for him, doing jobs like scamming wealthy-looking tourists and trick them and selling them stuff. Bridger would also befriend [[Moreena Krai]], a girl of the same age as him, who knew of his under-handed skills.<ref name=\"Ezra's Gamble\" />\n\n====Gladiator night====\n{{Quote|I hate to say so, Mr. Bossk, but I have a bad feeling about this.|Ezra Bridger|Ezra's Gamble}}\n[[File:EzraBridger.png|thumb|right|Ezra as a pickpocket on Lothal]]\nOne day at [[Capital City]]'s [[Capital City spaceport|spaceport]], Bridger was selling tickets for a [[Gladiator Night]] between a [[Houk]] and [[Feeorin]] when Krai told him her family and her were leaving for [[Alderaan]] to live with [[Moreena Krai's grandmother|her grandmother]] due to the Empire, and bade farewell to the boy. Later that day, Bridger caught sight of the ''[[Hound's Tooth]]'' and met [[Trandoshan]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], who hired him as a guide to [[Ake's Tavern]]. As they reached their destination, Bossk sent Bridger instead to lure his prey, [[Gronson Takkaro|Gronson \"Shifty\" Takkaro]], out; soon enough, however, a confrontation between Bossk and the [[assassin]]s [[Angrigo]] and the [[Unidentified Kratchell twin (blaster pistols)|Kratchell]] [[Unidentified Kratchell twin (disruptor rifle)|twins]] ensued, in which Bridger [[stun]]ned Takkaro, and Bossk killed the assassins, only for Imperial authorities to surround them. Aware of a likely set-up by [[Lieutenant]] [[Herdringer]], Bossk was forced to leave Takkaro and follow Bridger, and the two escaped from the Imperials on a [[speeder bike]]. During their escape, however, Bossk was injured and convinced Bridger to help him by offering the boy all the content of his strongbox onboard the ''Tooth''.<ref name=\"Ezra's Gamble\" />\n\nIn the course of an hour, Bridger took the Trandoshan to his tower and tended to his wounds, before the bounty hunter woke up, \"disguised\" himself as a blind Trandoshan and almost immediately prompted Bridger into leading him to a posting agency at the [[spaceport]], where he accessed the [[Imperial Enforcement DataCore]] to check records on Herdringer. However, they discovered Herdringer had been dead for months, and Bossk surmised that his replacement, [[Jenkes]], had been the one to set him up, now also aware that he and Takkaro had worked together in [[Nyriaan gladiator arena|gladiator arena]] in [[Nyriaan]] years before. Their search, though, attracted Jenkes' attention, who sent troopers to attack them, but Bridger and Bossk managed to slip away again, and they went to Wallaway's pawn shop, where they saw from afar as Jenkes shot Wallaway and took his money.<ref name=\"Ezra's Gamble\" />\n\nOnce Jenkes left the shop, Bridger and Bossk entered the place, only for Wallaway to die on Bridger's arms. Convinced by Bossk, he accompanied the Trandoshan to [[Monad Outpost]] during Gladiator Night, where they faced Jenkes. During the confrontation, Bridger used his stolen Imperial comlink to alert Jenkes' superiors, while Bossk told everyone on the arena of Jenkes' actions. Bridger, then, proceeded to stun the Imperial before he could flee the arena, just before Imperial forces arrived and swarmed the arena. The next morning, as promised, Bossk gave Bridger the contents of his strongbox, which turned out to be just seventy-five credits, and the Trandoshan bade him farewell.<ref name=\"Ezra's Gamble\" />\n\nOn his way home, Bridger was walking through the fields around his tower when a [[Ghost|freighter]] shot down a TIE fighter, which crashed not far from him. As Ezra tried to help [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron]] [[Valen Rudor]], he was rebuked for touching the starfighter. After successfully opening the top of the cockpit, Brdiger hopped inside and managed to trick the unlucky pilot into thinking he was helping get his armor unstuck, when in fact, he was actually stealing bits of equipment. After grabbing Rudor's [[helmet]] for his collection, Bridger quickly left the wreckage, while revealing his thievish intentions. Rudor, not meaning to be outsmarted by a kid, attempted to kill him with his fighter's lasers, but the boy's latent Force-sensitivity alerted him to a laser blast from the vengeful pilot. While the pilot was bewildered at how Bridger managed to survive the shot, the boy knocked him out with his [[energy slingshot]], and strutted away with his prize.<ref name=\"Property\" /><ref name=\"Ezra's Gamble\" />\n\nAmong the contents taken from the fighter, Ezra found a confidential memo mentioning and displaying the images of a [[Kanan Jarrus|human leader]] and a [[Hera Syndulla|Twilek pilot]] of a Rebel fighter ship.<ref name=\"Rebel Journal\">''[[Rebel Journal by Ezra Bridger]]''</ref>\n\n===Joining the Spectres===\n====Early encounters with the Spectres====\n{{Quote|Who ''is'' that kid?|Kanan Jarrus, on Ezra Bridger|Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion}}\nIn 3272 LY,<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> after a [[Star Destroyer]] flew over in Lothal's Capital City, Bridger went to the city and prevented a merchant from being imprisoned by Imperials, just before witnessing Kanan Jarrus and his team executing [[Heist in Capital City|a heist]], and intervening to steal one of the crate-carrying [[614-AvA speeder bike|speeder bikes]] they were after. As he fled with the stolen goods, he met [[Sabine Wren]], who proceeded to recover one of the crates.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" />\n\n[[File:Ghost_Hovers_Over_Ezra.png|thumb|left|220px|Jarrus offering Bridger an escape route]]\nChased through the streets and a roadway out of the city, Bridger had to board the ''Ghost'' as a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] closed-in on him. As the boy unknowingly used the Force to leap into the hovering ship with his crate, Jarrus was made aware of his Force-sensitivity. Inside the [[Starship|ship]], he met [[Garazeb Orrelios|Garazeb \"Zeb\" Orrelios]] and Hera Syndulla. Forced to remain with them for a while longer, Bridger was taken to [[Lothal re-settlement camp 43|Tarkintown]], where he helped deliver the stolen crates. Later, he returned to the ''Ghost'' and entered Kanan's quarters where he stole the former [[Jedi]]'s [[Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber|lightsaber]] and [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron|holocron]]. Bridger returned the [[lightsaber]], but kept the [[holocron]] to himself, thinking Jarrus hadn't noticed.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" />\n\nDuring the team's [[Mission to free Wookiee prisoners|operation]] to free [[Wookiee]]s, he stayed behind with Syndulla but was convinced to board a [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]] to alert Kanan, Sabine, Zeb and [[C1-10P|Chopper]] of an incoming Star Destroyer. However, he was captured by [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] and abandoned by Orrelios. In his cell, he was able to open Jarrus' holocron and see [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s message, before escaping from his prison and learning of the Wookiees' location.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" />\n\n[[File:Ezra_saving_Kitwarr.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ezra in an attempt to save Kitwarr's life from a stormtrooper]]\nOnce the ''Ghost'' returned, he boarded the ship along with everyone and revealed what he had learned, prompting the rebels to go to the [[Spice mines of Kessel|spice mines]] of [[Kessel]]. There, while the others kept the [[stormtrooper]]s busy, he freed the Wookiees and watched as Jarrus publicly revealed himself to be a Jedi. He rescued [[Kitwarr]], only to be saved from Kallus by Jarrus' sudden appearance on the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" />\n\nAfter sending the Wookiees on their way, Ezra stole Kanan's lightsaber once again, but returned the holocron before departing to his tower. Shortly after entering his room, Jarrus gave him two choices\u2014to keep the lightsaber and remain on Lothal, or return to the ship and become his Padawan and a member of the ''Ghost''{{'s}} crew. After taking some time to think on the offer, Ezra returned the lightsaber to Kanan, and became his apprentice.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" />\n\n====Mission to steal Imperial weapons====\nHis training, however, only began after a [[mission to steal Imperial weapons]] on the nearby planet of [[Garel]], involving the droids [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]]. During the mission, Bridger\u2014along with Jarrus, Orrelios, Wren and Chopper\u2014boarded the same [[Star Commuter 2000|star commuter shuttle]] where [[Amda Wabo]] and [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]] negotiated their agreement while on their way to Garel. Once there, Bridger infiltrated Bay Seven to open the door to the rest of the team, who managed to steal the [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s, and returned to Lothal. There, Syndulla told the boy of [[Siege of Lasan|Lasan's fall]]. During the unsuccessful transaction with [[Cikatro Vizago]] due to Kallus' arrival, Ezra saved Zeb after his duel with the [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] Agent. His use of the Force prompted Jarrus to begin his training the following day.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref>\n\n====The meiloorun hunt====\n[[File:Grafitti_zeb_and_ezra_room.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sabine Wren's depiction of Chopper's prank]]\nSome time later, Bridger accidentally angered Orrelios due to Chopper's actions and ended up making a mess in the cargo hold. Exasperated, Syndulla sent them both to town for a supply run, with a list that included the rare [[meiloorun fruit]]. The boy and the [[Lasat]] went to [[Kothal]], where they resolved to steal the fruit from an Imperial convoy. However, Bridger and Orrelios were forced to split up, with the Lasat stealing a TIE fighter to escape and save Bridger. Once aboard, the two contacted Syndulla and Jarrus, who ordered them to destroy the fighter and proceed to a rendezvous point.\n\nBefore doing so, Bridger asked Orrelios to check out a rising column of smoke on the horizon, which they discovered to be [[Morad Sumar]]'s freshly-destroyed farm. The pair decided to help the farmers, who were being held as [[prisoner]]s aboard an [[K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport|Imperial Troop Transport]]. After a [[Attack on Imperial Troop Transports|small confrontation]], the pair managed to save Sumar and two other prisoners from [[Yogar Lyste]], and retrieve a meiloorun fruit. Afterwards, they hid the stolen TIE fighter,<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref> but claimed to have destroyed it, to Jarrus and Syndulla's approval. Back aboard the ''Ghost'', Wren showed them her new work of art, depicting Chopper's prank.<ref name=\"Fighter Flight\">{{Rebels|Fighter Flight}}</ref>\n\n====Stygeon Prime====\n{{Quote|I don't want to dump you. Look, I just wanted you to have the best teacher.''\"<br />\"''Well, I don't want the best teacher! I want you.|Kanan and Ezra|Rise of the Old Masters}}\n[[File:Ezra_Trains_on_Ghost.png|thumb|right|220px|Ezra training on the top of the ''Ghost'']]\nAfter struggling with his Jedi training under a master full of self-doubt, Bridger saw one of [[Senator]] [[Gall Trayvis]]'s [[HoloNet|broadcasts]] for the first time, and was upset to hear that Jarrus wanted the imprisoned Jedi Master [[Luminara Unduli]] to teach Bridger and willing to free the [[Mirialan]] from the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]] on [[Stygeon Prime]]. Nevertheless, the boy took part of the operation and accompanied Jarrus to Unduli's cell, only to discover that she had been dead for years and was being used by [[the Grand Inquisitor]] as bait to lure any surviving Jedi to their end. Bridger tried to help Jarrus on his duel against the [[Pau'an]], who tried to lure the boy to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]]. After a difficult escape and their return to Lothal, Kanan promised him he would no longer try to teach Ezra, but to do with newfound resolve.<ref>{{Rebels|Rise of the Old Masters}}</ref>\n\n====The Imperial Academy====\nSometime later, Kanan sent Ezra on [[Mission to destroy a kyber crystal|mission]] to steal a decoder containing the location of a [[kyber crystal]] at [[Academy for Young Imperials|Lothal's Imperial Academy]]. Ezra was also supported by Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb. Chopper infiltrated the Academy disguised as an Imperial astromech droid while Sabine and Zeb waited outside the Academy in a [[landspeeder]] to pick Ezra up. Meanwhile, Kanan and Hera waited in space on the ''Ghost'' to launch their strike on the Imperial convoy carrying the kyber crystal.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\nFor this mission, Bridger posed as \"Dev Morgan,\" a transfer [[Cadet]] from the [[Pretor Flats Academy]] on the far side of Lothal. Upon arriving, Dev was assigned to [[Unit Aurek]], a four-member unit in Squad [[LRC077]]. While Dev quickly befriended [[Jai Kell]], he was disliked by [[Nazhros Oleg]] and [[Zare Leonis]]. The latter disliked Dev's braggadocio and carefree attitude and suspected that he was a spy or part of the plot that ensnared his sister [[Dhara Leonis]]. Unknown to Ezra, Leonis was a rebel sympathizer who had infiltrated the Academy to find his sister.<ref name=\"Rebel in the Ranks\" />\n\nBridger's arrival coincided with Squad LRC077 participating in a series of assessments run by [[Commandant]] [[Cumberlayne Aresko]] and [[Taskmaster]] [[Myles Grint]]. Due to his Force powers, Ezra was able to win five consecutive assessments over a period of two days. This caught the attention of not only the Imperial authorities at the Academy but Zare himself, who noted that Dev always seemed to be \"in the right place at the right time.\" During the sixth exercise, Dev and the other cadets had to leap onto floating [[repulsorlift]] platforms in order to climb out of the Well. After struggling with Oleg, Bridger was the first to reach the top, followed by Kell and Leonis respectively. As a reward, the three Cadets were assigned to work as aides at the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]] on Lothal.<ref name=\"Rebel in the Ranks\" />\n\nWhile working in the Imperial Complex, Ezra infiltrated Agent Kallus' office and stole the decoder. Before he could leave, he was intercepted by Leonis, who shoved Bridger back into the room. To Bridger's surprise, Zare helped him by revealing that the device had a built-in sensor which would cause the facility to go into lockdown if it was illegally taken out of the room. Later that night, Zare asked Dev why he needed the decoder. While not revealing his true identity, Ezra revealed that his friends needed it to stop an Imperial shipment. When Ezra asked Leonis how he knew about the sensors, Zare told him about his missing older sister Dhara. While the Empire claimed that she had run away, he believed that the Empire was not telling the truth.<ref name=\"Rebel in the Ranks\" />\n\nDuring their meeting, the two boys reached an agreement that Zare would help Dev to steal the decoder from Kallus' office. After Dev and his rebel associates had finished using the decoder, they would provide it to Leonis' girlfriend [[Merei Spanjaf]], a hacker who was trying to access classified Imperial files about Dhara. In order to work in the Imperial Complex, both boys resolved to win the next assessment in the Well. This time, the assessment involved the Cadets using [[E-11 blaster rifle|E-11 rifles]] to shoot targets in order to activate the panels necessary to climb out. During the exercise, Ezra was forced to shove Jai in the back in order to maintain his place. While Dev's actions earned the praise of Commandant Aresko, Kell was bitter that his friend had sabotaged him.<ref name=\"Rebel in the Ranks\" />\n\nWith Merei's help, Dev and Leonis managed to forge a fake requisition order for [[podracer]] parts. While Leonis distracted Kallus with the fake order, Ezra crept into the ISB agent's room through the ceiling and used the Force to levitate the decoder. However, Ezra also discovered that Commandant Aresko had taken an interest in himself and Jai Kell, who met the [[Grand Inquisitor]]'s \"[[Force-sensitive|special criteria]].\" The Inquisitor responded that he would visit the Academy the following day to assess the two Cadets and take them into custody. When pressed by Zare, Dev admitted that he was Force-sensitive. Both resolved to prevent Kell from meeting the same fate as Dhara.<ref name=\"Rebel in the Ranks\" />\n\nEzra managed to pass the stolen decoder to Chopper and also recorded a message for Sabine and Zeb. In that message, he told his fellow rebels that he had to stay in the Academy to protect Kell from being kidnapped by the Inquisitor. He also told Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb to attack the Academy in the morning in order to create a diversion for them to escape.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" /> That night, Dev and Leonis woke up Kell and convinced him to escape with them. While Kell was initially distrustful, Leonis managed to reason with him by telling him about his sister. The three Cadets then resolved to escape the Academy by winning the next training exercise in the Well so that they could ride on the [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walker]].<ref name=\"Rebel in the Ranks\" />\n\nThe following day, their plan encountered an unexpected setback when Ezra was knocked down by a blast fired by Oleg. Thus, Kell, Leonis, and Oleg were designated as the winners and allowed to ride on the AT-DP walker. Despite this problem, Dev told his fellow Cadets to stick to the plan. As part of the escape plan, Chopper planted a detonator on a nearby AT-DP walker, causing it to crash to the ground. This gave the signal for Jai to stun the walker's [[Imperial combat driver]] and Oleg with his blaster. The hijacked AT-DP walker then exchanged fire with an Imperial Troop Transport. During the chaos, Ezra used his Force abilities to climb onto the walker under the ruse of fighting the hijackers.<ref name=\"Rebel in the Ranks\" />\n\nWith much difficulty, the AT-DP walker managed to exit the Academy's gates. There, Ezra and Kell were picked up by the other rebels. However, Leonis opted to stay behind in order to find out about his sister and told him they would stay in touch. After Syndulla and Jarrus' return to Lothal, the rebels agreed to help Kell and his [[Jai Kell's mother|mother]] hide from the Empire. Following the rebel attack on the Academy, the Inquisitor quickly realized upon examining a picture of \"Dev Morgan\" that he had encountered Ezra and his Master before.<ref name=\"Breaking Ranks\" />\n\n====Disaster at Fort Anaxes====\nLater on, Bridger accompanied Syndulla and Wren aboard the ''Phantom'' for an assault on a Imperial convoy, but the damage done to the shuttle had to be repaired. Assigned along with Orrelios and Chopper to repair it, they never finished due to another of their scuffles, thus leaving Wren and Syndulla temporarily trapped on their mission to [[Fort Anaxes]]. After rescuing them, the boy and the Lasat apologized.<ref name=\"Out of Darkness\">{{Rebels|Out of Darkness}}</ref>\n\n====Empire Day====\n{{Quote|I am ready. Wait. Ready for what?''\"<br />\"''For a test, a real challenge one that could determine if you're meant to be a Jedi or not.|Bridger and Kanan Jarrus|Path of the Jedi}}\nOn Bridger's fifteenth birthday, Jarrus began training Bridger to use the Force to influence animals, but they soon went to [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]] to learn of the Empire's search for an old friend of Bridger's parents, the Rodian Tseebo. Wanting to be alone for a while, Bridger returned to his tower only to meet up with Jarrus, Wren and Orrelios after they ruined the Imperial parade by detonating a bomb in the recently-unveiled [[TIE Advanced v1]].<ref name=\"Empire Day\" />\n\nDuring their escape, Bridger guided Jarrus and Wren into his old residence, where they found Tseebo and the boy told them of his past. Considering the valuable information the Rodian possessed, the three rebels decided to smuggle him out of Capital City in a stolen Imperial Troop Transport, and later aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> Despite being pursued by both Kallus and the Inquisitor, the ship managed to jump into hyperspace after Tseebo transmitted the [[hyperspace]] coordinates to the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' hyperdrive. Later, when the crew were discussing what to do with Tseebo, Ezra expressed hostility and indifference since Tseebo had not helped his parents when the Empire came after them.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}</ref>\n\nEzra briefly recounted how he had been living on the streets of Lothal for the past eight years until he encountered the crew of the ''Ghost''. Kanan warned his apprentice that he could not move forward if he was unable to let go of his past. In the middle of the meeting, Tseebo detected the presence of a [[XX-23 S-thread tracker|tracking beacon]], which Chopper quickly deduced was located on the ''Phantom{{'s}}'' hull. Sensing that the Inquisitor was pursuing them, Kanan decided that he and Ezra would depart on the ''Phantom'' in order to lure the Imperials away from the ''Ghost''. Prior to departing, Ezra was still unable to forgive Tseebo.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\nAfter exiting hyperspace, Ezra and Kanan took the shuttle to [[PM-1203]], the asteroid which hosted the former Republic base Fort Anaxes. Earlier, Hera and Sabine had been stranded on Fort Anaxes and accosted by the local [[fyrnock]]s after the ''Phantom'' experienced a fuel leak. Once in there, Jarrus prompted Bridger to let go of his fear, so that he could connect with the fyrnocks. After accepting his fear and forgiving Tseebo, Bridger learned how to influence the creatures. When the Inquisitor and his stormtroopers arrived on the asteroid, Ezra unleashed the fyrnocks on them. As Jarrus dueled the darksider, Bridger commanded the fyrnocks to attack the remaining stormtroopers.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\n[[File:Gathering_Forces_thumb.png|thumb|left|220px|Ezra briefly gives into the dark side of the Force.]]\nHowever, as the Pau'an managed to knock out Jarrus and cornered Bridger, the boy tapped into the dark side and controlled an enormous fyrnock that attacked the Inquisitor. However, this momentarily knocked Bridger out, forcing his master to carry him to the ''Phantom''. On their return to the ''Ghost'', Jarrus explained to him what happened and apologized for not teaching him what he needed to know. Then, Bridger spent some time alone until Wren gave him a birthday gift\u2014a disk containing a picture of Bridger and his parents together\u2014, and proceeded to stare at the picture for a while. Unknown to Ezra, Hera had a brief conversation with Tseebo prior to him departing into hiding with the mysterious rebel leader known as [[Ahsoka Tano|Fulcrum]]. He revealed the true fate of Ezra's parents and Hera promised to tell Ezra the truth when he was ready.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" />\n\n====Jedi Trials====\n[[File:Ezra_guided_by_Yoda.png|thumb|right|220px|Yoda appears to Bridger as a guiding light]]\nSome time after his dangerous connection with the Dark Side on Fort Anaxes, Bridger missed training for showing Wren the TIE fighter he had stolen during an earlier adventure with Orrelios.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" /> Kanan then decided to put his apprentice through a challenge to determine if he was worthy of being a Jedi. To do so, he instructed Bridger to locate a [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]], which to their surprise was on Lothal. Once inside the temple, Bridger continued alone and was faced with several illusions.<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\">{{Rebels|Path of the Jedi}}</ref>\n\nFirstly, he saw the Inquisitor striking Jarrus down. Secondly, he heard the rest of crew speaking about Bridger as if they had little faith in him, only for them to be killed by the Inquisitor. Thirdly, Ezra was forced to confront the Inquisitor alone. However, the boy managed to see through the illusions and overcome his fear. After passing through his trials, Ezra heard the voice of the Jedi Master [[Yoda]]. The Jedi Master guided him through the ancient temple and asked him a series of questions. When asked why he wanted to become a Jedi, Bridger admitted that he desired revenge against the Empire. When corrected by Yoda, Ezra expressed his desire to protect others. Pleased by Ezra's answers, Yoda gifted him a kyber crystal and wished Ezra well in his Jedi path.<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\" />\n\nReturning to entryway and meeting up with Jarrus, his master explained that the small crystal he had received could be used to build a lightsaber. Over the course of several weeks, Bridger built [[Ezra Bridger's lightsaber|a lightsaber]] with the help of the crew. Jarrus gave him spare lightsaber parts that he had found over the previous fifteen years, Wren donated modulation circuits and an energy gate, Chopper donated a power cell and Syndulla likewise provided additional technology based on Bridger's specifications.<ref name=\"SWR:TVG\" /> With all of the rebels assembled, the boy presented the finished weapon to Jarrus, who thought the design fit his apprentice. When he returned it, Bridger ignited the lightsaber for the first time.<ref name=\"Path of the Jedi\" />\n\n====Dealing with Lando====\nAfter Orrelios and Jarrus lost Chopper in game of [[sabacc]] to [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], they reluctantly struck a deal to help him [[Smuggler|smuggle]] goods to Lothal. During their job run for Calrissian, Bridger quickly took a dislike for Calrissian after the \"galactic entrepreneur\" flirted with the young [[Mandalorian]]. After the smuggler received a [[puffer pig]] from [[Azmorigan]] and Syndulla returned to the ''Ghost'', Bridger and Orrelios scared the pig, causing the creature to inflate. This left Hera and the rest of the crew trapped outside the bridge. In the meantime, Kanan was forced to take the helm of the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>\n\nTo make matters worse, Bridger climbed over the puffer pig, causing the animal to inflate even more and accidentally pushing Orrelios to deactivate the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' signature mask. The ''Ghost'' was then pursued by several TIE fighters but Kanan managed to loose them following a brief dog-fight. Upon landing at [[Lando Calrissian's farm]], the rebels were immediately accosted by Azmorigan and his henchmen, who had come for retribution against Calrissian. However, the rebels fought them off and drove them away. During the fight, Ezra used his lightsaber to fire shots at Azmorigan's henchmen. After saving Lando, the crew departed on the ''Ghost'' with Chopper stealing Calrissian's [[fuel]] canisters as compensation for their risky job.<ref name=\"Idiot's Array\" />\n\n====The false rebel====\n[[File:Rebels_protect_Trayvis.png|thumb|left|250px|Bridger and Jarrus attempting to protect Trayvis from Imperial forces]]\nAfter a training session on deflecting blasters, Ezra experienced a [[Force vision|vision]] that involved Gall Trayvis. Later, he and his comrades saw Trayvis's broadcast inviting the rebels to meet him at the [[Lothal City Capitol Building]] in Lothal's Capital City. Despite his eagerness, Jarrus' suspicions made Bridger verify some intel with his old friend Zare Leonis, who then informed him know that he was being transferred to [[Arkanis Academy|Officer's Academy]] in [[Arkanis]]. Feeling guilty, Bridger then revealed \"Morgan\" was an alias, but as stormtroopers interrupted their meeting, he was unable to tell Leonis his real name.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\">{{Rebels|Vision of Hope}}</ref>\n\nLater, Bridger rejoined the rest of the team and met Trayvis at the Senate Building, only to be cornered by Agent Kallus and Minister Maketh Tua. Escaping through the sewers, the rebels split into two groups. Kanan along with Sabine and Zeb departed in one direction. Meanwhile Bridger, Syndulla and Trayvis reached a dead end, blocked by a fan. At this opportune moment, the Senator revealed his true colors as an Imperial agent. Syndulla, however, knocked him out just as they were rejoined by Wren, Orrelios and Jarrus. They then linked up with Chopper and fled aboard the ''Ghost''. After escaping, Bridger was very disappointed for interpreting his vision incorrectly, which Jarrus said was because of his emotions, but Syndulla encouraged the boy to have hope.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\" />\n\n====Confronting Tarkin====\n{{Quote|Stand up together. Because that's when we're strongest\u2014as one.|Ezra Bridger|Call to Action}}\nAfter a [[raid near Jalath]], the turncoat Senator Trayvis gave a public broadcast on HoloNet reaffirming his loyalty to the Empire and condemning the Spectres. In response, Kanan decided to hijack the [[Imperial Communications Center]] near [[Jalath]] to broadcast their own counter-propaganda. Bridger participated in this mission and accompanied Jarrus, Wren, Zeb, and Chopper on their mission to infiltrate the tower. Despite destroying a [[dwarf probe droid]], [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] was alerted to their presence and ordered the Inquisitor and Agent Kallus to launch their trap. Tarkin had arrived on Lothal to implement a permanent solution to the Lothal rebel presence.<ref name=\"Call to Action\">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref>\n\nDespite Ezra's concerns, he took part in the mission to secure the tower. Chopper uploaded a data spike which allowed the rebels to control the tower. When the rebels were cornered by Imperial forces, Kanan ordered Bridger and the other rebels to escape up the lift to the top of the tower while he confront the Imperials alone. After destroying an Imperial [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|patrol transport]], Ezra and his companions reluctantly escaped with Hera aboard the ''Phantom''; leaving Kanan behind. Following Kanan's capture, Bridger [[Ezra's broadcast|spoke]] to the people of Lothal at sunrise, encouraging them to stand up against the Empire. He finished his message just as Tarkin ordered his patrol transports to destroy the tower.<ref name=\"Call to Action\" />\n\nDetermined to [[Action at Mustafar|rescue Jarrus]], Bridger disobeyed Syndulla's orders to stop searching for the former Jedi and enlisted Chopper, Wren and Orrelios' help to escape on the ''Phantom''. While Chopper kept Hera preoccupied, Ezra along with Wren and Orrelios met up with the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] Vizago. After revealing to his Force powers to Vizago, the crime lord revealed that the Imperials were using [[courier droid]]s to transport classified information in the light of the comm tower's destruction. With Syndulla's approval, he conceived a plan and they sent a disguised Chopper to retrieve Jarrus' location, only to learn at the droid's return that Jarrus was being held aboard Tarkin's Star Destroyer ''[[Sovereign]]'', which was due to travel to the [[Mustafar system]].<ref name=\"Rebel Resolve\">{{Rebels|Rebel Resolve}}</ref>\n\nTo approach the ''Sovereign'', the rebels stole [[Evac One|an Imperial transport ship]] and used their stolen TIE fighter to infiltrate the Star Destroyer. Once inside, Bridger separated from the others and rescued Jarrus from his cell, helping him walk to the [[Reactor|reactor core]] where they were confronted by the Inquisitor. Though he tried to assist Jarrus in his duel with the Pau'an, Bridger was quickly overpowered by the darksider and fell onto another platform\u2014his apparent death prompting Jarrus to lose his fear and fight with renewed resolve.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\nAfter receiving a message from Syndulla, Bridger reunited with his master, who had just defeated the Inquisitor once and for all. The two, then, told Syndulla to part with Orrelios and Wren while they took [[The Inquisitor's TIE Advanced|the Inquisitor's TIE]] to join them. However, the rebels could escape only when Chopper and a fleet of [[blockade runner]]s jumped from hyperspace and attacked the pursuing TIE fighters. Afterwards, the rebels docked with the ''Ghost'' and escaped the Mustafar system, Syndulla revealed that their cell was part of a wider rebel network. They were also greeted by a hologram of Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and [[Fulcrum]], who revealed herself as the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. She then informed them that Bridger's message had given people hope and that a new chapter in the boy's life was about to begin.<ref name=\"Fire Across the Galaxy\" />\n\n===The rebellion===\n====Raid on Area Null====\n[[File:RescueofDharaLeonis.png|thumb|right|220px|Bridger and his fellow Spectres storming Area Null]]\nFollowing Kanan's rescue, Ezra Bridger and two of his fellow rebels Zeb and Sabine participated in a [[Rescue of Dhara Leonis|mission]] to rescue Zare Leonis, a cadet at the Lothal Imperial Academy that Ezra had befriended during a mission to steal a [[decoder]] from Agent Kallus. Earlier, Ezra's companions had picked up several fugitives including Zare's girlfriend Spanjaf, a slicer who had managed to hack into the Imperial data network on Lothal. Merei also discovered that Zare had been exposed as a traitor while training at the Arkanis Academy and was scheduled to be tried before a military tribunal. Merei convinced Ezra and her companions to help her.<ref name=\"Secret Academy\">''[[Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy]]''</ref>\n\nTogether with Merei and her mother [[Jessa Spanjaf]], Ezra, Zeb, and Sabine traveled to the planet Arkanis on the ''Ghost'', which they had borrowed from Hera without seeking her permission. After learning that Zare was being held at a secret Imperial facility known as [[Area Null]], Ezra and his companions landed the ''Ghost'' on the facility's rooftop. Making their way downstairs, they encountered Zare and another prisoner named [[Beck Ollet]], who had already succeeded in freeing themselves and had planed to free Zare's sister Dhara, who had been forcibly inducted into [[Project Harvester]]. While Ezra guarded the rooftop, his companions rescued Dhara and locked Imperial reinforcements out of the facility. After achieving their objectives, they returned to Garel and reunited Zare and Dhara with their parents, who had also fled into hiding.<ref name=\"Secret Academy\" />\n\n====Rescuing a defector====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Hera_rebellion_talk.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra watches as Kanan and Hera discuss their differences]]\nFollowing the rescue of Kanan, Ezra learnt that his rebel cell was part of a larger rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Ezra and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' joined the [[Phoenix Cell]] fleet and took part in a [[Mission to steal Imperial shield generators|mission to steal]] [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]] from the Empire to help defend the fleet. The rebels ambushed a group of Imperial [[freighter]]s and stole several fuel supplies from one of the vessels. After the ''Ghost'' secured the cargo, the rebels fled into hyperspace after the arrival of several Imperial [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|light cruisers]]. In response to the increased rebel activity around the Lothal system, the Emperor dispatched his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], to stamp out this threat.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>\n\nLater, Ezra was present on the bridge of the rebel command ship ''[[Phoenix Home]]'' when the Phoenix rebel leadership received a holographic transmission from the disillusioned Imperial Minister Tua, who wanted to defect from the Empire. In exchange for asking the rebels for help, she offered to reveal vital Imperial information&mdash;including the names of rebel sympathizers on Lothal and nearby star systems, as well as intelligence regarding the Empire's true mission on Lothal. During the ensuing discussion, Ezra successfully convinced his rebel comrades that they had an obligation to help her. In the end Kanan, Hera, Ahsoka, and the Phoenix cell leader Commander [[Jun Sato|Sato]] approved the mission. Ezra was also aware of a disagreement between Hera and Kanan. While Hera supported the rebellion, Kanan was reluctant to involve the crew of the ''Ghost'' in a military operation and wanted them to return to their previous mission of robbing from the Empire and giving to the needy.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nAs part of their mission, the crew of the ''Ghost'' infiltrated Lothal on a Star Commuter 2000 shuttle. While passing through the Imperial security cordon around Lothal, Ezra noted the increased presence of Imperial Star Destroyers above Capital City. While Zeb and Chopper stayed behind to man the shuttle, Ezra and the other rebels headed to their pre-arranged rendezvous point to pick up Minister Tua. The Imperial Minister had arranged for them to meet at a landing bay where an Imperial shuttle was waiting to take her for a private audience with Grand Moff Tarkin. Ezra, Sabine, and Hera hid among the rooftops while Kanan infiltrated the facility disguised as a [[Stormtrooper Commander]]. Unknown to the rebels however, Agent Kallus had set a trap for them and arranged for Minister Tua to be killed in a shuttle explosion. The rebels were blamed for the bombing and were forced to flee.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nEzra and his fellow rebels attempted to escape on their Star Commuter shuttle, but it was shot down by an AT-DP walker. In response, Darth Vader ordered the Imperial forces on Lothal to place the planet on lockdown and to hunt down the rebel cell. The Spectres sought shelter in Ezra's former family home but Imperial stormtroopers quickly caught up with them and the rebels barely managed to escape with their lives. During the ensuing flight, Ezra's former home was destroyed by an Imperial [[thermal detonator]]. With Imperial forces spread out throughout Lothal, the rebels decided to infiltrate the Imperial headquarters in Capital City and escape offworld. While Ezra and Kanan posed as an [[Imperial cadet]] and stormtrooper, the other rebels hid in crates. Their ruse worked and they managed to infiltrate the Imperial headquarters.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\n====Escaping Darth Vader====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Ezra_face_Darth_Vader.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra and Kanan confront Vader on Lothal]]\nThe rebels managed to steal several shield generators and began loading them onto an Imperial shuttle. However, they were then cornered by Darth Vader who was accompanied by several stormtroopers. Ezra and his Master sensed the strong presence of the Dark Side around their new adversary. They attempted to engage the [[Sith Lord]] in lightsaber combat but found themselves outmatched by Vader, who even used the Force to summon Ezra's lightsaber towards the Padawan's neck. Only the timely intervention of Kanan saved Ezra's life. After a protracted skirmish, Ezra and his fellow rebels managed to escape the Imperial headquarters in their stolen shuttle. Following their encounter with Darth Vader, Ezra and his master Kanan conceded that this Sith Lord was much more powerful than the Inquisitor they had previously encountered and that they were lucky to escape with their lives.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nKnowing that Darth Vader had a blockade in orbit waiting for them, the Spectres decided to smuggle themselves offworld with the help of an old acquaintance: Lando Calrissian. Calrissian, who was offworld at the time, agreed to help them in exchange for obtaining three of their shield generators and instructed the rebels to visit his farm where his droid [[W1-LE]] would assist their escape arrangements. Shortly after arriving at Calrissian's farm, Ezra noticed smoke coming from the nearby settlement of Tarkintown and went to investigate. Upon arriving, Ezra discovered that the Imperials had rounded up the settlement's population as punishment for accepting assistance from the Spectres. Shortly later, Ezra was joined by his master Kanan who surmised that Tarkintown had been destroyed to spread fear on Lothal. Both Jedi agreed that things were getting worse in the galaxy but disagreed over whether they could make any difference.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nBack on Calrissian's farm, Sabine and W1-LE managed to improvised several sensor buoys that would replicate the shuttle's signal and scatter the Imperial forces trying to track them down. The rebels also resolved not to return to Lothal in order to avoid bringing further danger to its people. This ploy worked and the rebels managed to escape offworld undetected. However, Darth Vader had secretly planted a tracking device on their shuttle with the aim of tracking down the Phoenix rebel fleet. Shortly after rejoining the rebel fleet, the rebels were attacked by a lone [[TIE Advanced x1]] starfighter piloted by Vader himself. The Sith Lord proceeded to wreck havoc among the rebel ships and inflicted heavy damage on the flagship ''Phoenix Home''. During the space battle, Ezra sensed Vader's presence. Tano also sensed the Dark Lord's presence and quickly discovered that he was none other than the former [[Jedi Knight]] Anakin Skywalker. Vader was then joined by two Star Destroyers but the ''Ghost'' and the surviving Phoenix rebels managed to flee into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nFollowing the [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (4 BBY)|battle]], Ezra and Kanan related their earlier confrontation with Darth Vader to Ahsoka Tano. When Ezra questioned her about whether she knew who the Sith Lord was, Tano feigned ignorance due to the sensitive nature of the topic. Despite the odds against them, the three Jedi resolved to fight against Vader and anyone else seeking to destroy them.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\n====Meeting the lost commanders====\nIn the wake of the destruction of the ''Phoenix Home'', the rebellion faced a shortage of bases and facilities. When Ezra suggested that the Phoenix Squadron seek shelter on a remote system, Ahsoka counseled Ezra and his companions to seek out an old friend, the former [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]]. Ezra and the crew of the ''Ghost'' traveled to the desert world of [[Seelos]] to seek out Ahsoka's friend. Upon exiting hyperspace, the ''Ghost'' was damaged. While Hera and Chopper stayed behind to repair the freighter, Ezra and the other rebels traveled down to Seelos on the ''Phantom''.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref>\n\nAfter traveling for some distance, the rebels spotted an antiquated [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TE walker]] in the distance. After disembarking from the ''Phantom'', Ezra and his fellow rebels went to meet the occupants of the walker, whom they discovered were Clone commanders. Following a near conflict sparked by Kanan's distrust of Clone troopers, they were greeted by Rex who promptly broke up the fight. After Ezra mentioned that he and his companions had been sent by Ahsoka to look for Rex, Rex welcomed them as friends and introduced his companions, [[Wolffe]] and [[Gregor]]. While Rex and Gregor were friendly, Wolffe remained hostile to the rebels.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" />\n\nInside the walker, Ezra tried to convince the Clone commanders to join their fight against the Empire. Rex refused, stating that his life as a soldier was over. Kanan then asked the Clones whether he knew about any abandoned bases and facilities that the rebellion could use. Gregor offered to supply them with the information in return that the rebels participated in a hunt for [[joopa]]s. While Kanan remained aloof and distrustful of the clones, Ezra advised his master to trust them. When Kanan recounted the [[Great Jedi Purge]], Rex assured the two Jedi that he and his fellow clones had removed their [[brain]] [[behavioral modification biochip]]s, which allowed them to ignore [[Order 66]].<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" />\n\n[[File:Rex_confronts_Kanan.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra watches as Rex confronts Kanan about the Jedi Purge]]\nAfter a dangerous but successful hunt for a joopa, the rebels reluctantly stayed for dinner. Sabine then discovered that Wolffe had secretly contacted the Empire and hidden Ahsoka's communications with the clones. Wolffe had acted on a mistaken belief that he was protected his fellow clones from Imperial retribution. Rex confronted Wolffe and convinced him that the rebels were their friends. Shortly later, an Imperial [[probe droid]] damaged the ''Phantom'' before Rex managed to destroy it. With the Empire now alerted to their presence on Seelos, the rebels made preparations to leave.<ref name=\"The Lost Commanders\" />\n\nAs agreed, Rex supplied the rebels with a data chip listing Republic bases in the Outer Rim. While Ezra tried to convince the clones to accompany them on the ''Phantom'', Rex and his comrades insisted on staying behind to hold back the Empire. Shortly later, Agent Kallus arrived with three [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]], which outgunned and outnumbered the clone's lone AT-TE walker. This [[Assault on Seelos|assault]] coincided with the arrival of a sandstorm, which prevented the rebels from departing.<ref name=\"Relics of the Old Republic\">{{Rebels|Relics of the Old Republic}}</ref>\n\nWhile the clones and Imperials were blinded by the sandstorm, Ezra and Kanan could still see through the Force. While Kanan guided the clones in their AT-TE walker, Ezra used the walker's main cannon to destroy one of the AT-AT walkers with one blast to the neck. After the dust-storm had cleared, the rebels left on the ''Phantom''. However, Ezra persuaded Kanan to return and help the clone commanders, arguing that the clones would fight to the death. While Sabine flew the ''Phantom'', Ezra along with Kanan and Zeb commandeered one of the AT-AT walkers and used it to damage Kallus' walker, which was trapping the clones' AT-TE walker. Kallus and the surviving Imperials were to forced to retreat. Out of gratitude, Rex and the clones saluted Ezra and Kanan and agreed to join the Rebellion. Ezra was present during Rex's reunion with Ahsoka.<ref name=\"Relics of the Old Republic\" />\n\n====Encountering double trouble====\n[[File:Sabine_battles_Inquisitors.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Bridger and Wren hold off an Inquisitor attack]]\nFollowing their adventure on Seelos, Ezra continued his Jedi instruction under Kanan. During one lesson, he was instructed to levitate Chopper with the Force. However, Chopper and Sabine had decided to play a trick on the young Jedi by locking Chopper's feet to the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' metallic floor. Despite Ezra's best efforts, he was unable to lift the astromech droid. In frustration, Ezra gave up only for Rex to expose Chopper and Sabine's prank. When Ezra called the trick unfair, Kanan reminded him that a real fights are rarely ever fair. While Kanan and Rex argued about how to best instruct Ezra, the young Padawan sneaked off with Sabine, Chopper, and Zeb on a mission to salvage medical supplies from an abandoned Republic medical station in space.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>\n\nThe rebels had gained access to intelligence on Old Republic military installations provided by Rex. The four rebels departed on the ''Phantom'' for the abandoned station. After Chopper powered up the station, Ezra, Sabine, and Zeb searched for the supplies while Chopper stayed behind in the command center. Unknown to the four rebels, their presence on the station had attracted the attention of two [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] known as the [[Seventh Sister]] and the [[Fifth Brother]]. After the Sister's [[ID9 seeker droid]]s incapacitated Chopper, the Seventh Sister lured Ezra and Sabine into a hallway.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\" />\n\nAt first, Ezra mistook the Sister for a bounty hunter but quickly realized she was an Inquisitor when she ignited her twin-bladed lightsaber. Bridger took on the Seventh Sister but proved no match for the Dark Sider. While fleeing, the two Jedi bumped into the Fifth Brother, who joined the fight. After opening a shut door, Ezra was captured by the Sister's seeker droids. To protect Sabine, he shut the door after she had fled. The Fifth Brother wanted to kill Ezra but the Seventh Sister convinced her companion to use him as a bait to capture the others.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\" />\n\nWhile the Fifth Brother hunted for Sabine and Zeb, the Seventh Sister interrogated the young Jedi. The Inquisitor attempted to flatter Bridger by praising his skills as Jedi and offering to teach him more. She added that his Master Kanan had never attained the rank of Jedi Knight and was thus unqualified to instruct a Padawan. When Bridger mentioned that Kanan had defeated the Grand Inquisitor, the Sister remarked that this setback presented the other Inquisitors with \"new opportunities.\" The Seventh Sister then interrogated Ezra about the rebel fleet and Ahsoka Tano but Ezra refused to cooperated and feigned ignorance.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\" />\n\nBefore the Sister could continue with her interrogation, the Fifth Brother turned up with a captured Sabine in two. The Seventh Sister then tried to coerce Ezra into contacting his fellow rebels but he refused. Meanwhile, Zeb succeeded in rescuing Chopper and retrieving the medical supplies. The Lasat concocted a plan to rescue Ezra and Sabine. Posing as \"Commander Meiloorun,\" Zeb contacted Ezra, offering them support. To avoid endangering Zeb, Ezra refused to reply. However, the Fifth Brother threatened to behead Sabine and he reluctantly complied.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\" />\n\nEzra and Sabine were herded into hangar bay six by their Inquisitor captors. Upon arriving there, Bridger and Wren spotted Zeb in the ''Phantom'', which was hanging upside down on the ceiling. When one of the Seventh Sister's seeker droids spotted the Lasat, Zeb created a commotion that enable Ezra and Sabine to break free of their captors' clutches and board the attack shuttle. Following a brief struggle, the four rebels managed to escape with the medical supplies back to the rebel fleet. Upon returning to the ''Ghost'', they informed Kanan, Hera, and Rex about their encounter with the two Inquisitors. This news came as a shock to Kanan who was unaware that there was more than one Inquisitor.<ref name=\"Always Two There Are\" />\n\n====Working with a pirate====\nLater, the crew of the ''Ghost'' and Rex set up base on Garel. On one occasion, Ezra skipped one of his Jedi lessons with Kanan to attend a blaster training session taught by Rex. During the lesson, Ezra used a stormtrooper helmet held up by Chopper as a target but constantly missed. Shortly later, Kanan interrupted the lesson and reprimanded his apprentice for missing his Jedi lesson. When Rex and Kanan argued about whether Ezra's future lay as a soldier or Jedi, Ezra responded that he may not wish to be either. At that point, Sabine announced that the rebels were convening a meeting on the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\">{{Rebels|Brothers of the Broken Horn}}</ref>\n\nDuring the meeting, Hera announced that the rebels would be embarking on a mission to supply power fuel cells to the frozen planet of [[Rinn]], which was experiencing an energy crisis. The other ''Ghost'' crew would search Garel for the fuel cells but Ezra and Chopper were ordered by Hera to stay behind to clean up the ''Ghost''. While cleaning the ship, Ezra complained about his new responsibilities and yearned for the days when he was living on the streets. At that point, Ezra and Chopper received a distress call from the Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizago. Seeing this as an opportunity to skip chores and to return Vizago a favor, Ezra and Chopper departed on the ''[[Phantom]]''.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\nFollowing a rough take-off, Ezra and Chopper managed to locate Vizago's ship, the ''[[Broken Horn]]'', in space. After docking the ''Phantom'' in the ''Broken Horn{{'s}}'' hangar bay, the two rebels parted and explored the ship. While Chopper found several power generators, Ezra headed to the bridge where he encountered the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Ohnaka claimed that he had won the ''Broken Horn'' from Vizago during a game of sabacc. In reality, Ohnaka had incapacitated the Devaronian with a stun [[blaster]] and locked him in one of the ship's holding cells.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\nDistrusting Ohnaka, Ezra claimed to be \"Lando Calrissian,\" which delighted Ohnaka. Shortly later, an Imperial ship attacked the ''Broken Horn''. Ezra managed to power up the engines while Chopper managed to make the ship jump into hyperspace. After escaping the Imperials, Ezra agreed to help Ohnaka sell several power generators to a buyer on the frigid planet of [[Nixus]] in return for obtaining two of the generators and sharing half of the proceeds. Unknown to Ohnaka, Ezra also stole the controller for Vizago's droids and handed it to Chopper for safekeeping.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\n[[File:Brothers_of_the_Broken_Horn_thumb.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bridger and Hondo Ohnaka working together]]\nUpon arriving at Nixus, Ezra and Hondo quickly discovered that the buyer was an old enemy, Azmorigan, who had been expecting Vizago instead. Seeking to settle scores with both his foes, the [[Jablogian]] crime lord had them loaded into a loading dolly with the intention of firing them into space. Ezra contacted Chopper for helped. Before Azmorigan could carry out his plan, Chopper came to the rescue and toppled one of the generators over several of Azmorigan's men. During the commotion, Ezra managed to free himself and used his lightsaber to deflect Azmorigan's blaster shots. The young Padawan also used the Force to save Ohnaka from being fired into space, revealing his identity as a Jedi.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\nAfter escaping Azmorigan, Ezra, Chopper and Hondo departed Nixus on the ''Broken Horn'' and traveled back to Garel. On the way, Bridger revealed his true identity as a Jedi and rebel to Hondo and confided his anxieties about his new responsibilities. In response, Ohnaka suggested that Ezra becoming a \"pirate Jedi.\" Shortly later, Ezra and Chopper ventured into the ship's brig where they discovered that Vizago was locked inside one of his cells. After revealing the truth about Ohnaka's takeover, the two rebels freed Vizago and together confronted Ohnaka on the bridge.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\nEzra proposed a deal between the two criminals: him taking the generators and the two criminals sharing the proceeds among themselves. However, Vizago had secretly taken back his droid controller and used it to summon his droids to attack the three intruders. During the fighting, Ohnaka escaped aboard the ''Phantom'' and fled into space with the stolen proceeds. After reclaiming his ship, Vizago dispatched Ezra and Chopper back to Garel on an [[escape pod]]. Upon returning to the ''Ghost'', Ezra and Chopper found Ohnaka among the rebels and discovered that the ''Phantom{{'s}}'' autopilot had been programmed to return to its mother ship. The rebels allowed Ohnaka to keep his proceeds but took the power generators. After bidding the pirate farewell, Ezra rejoined his rebel companions.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\n====Lightsaber training with Ahsoka====\n{{Quote|So you needed your weapon after all.''\"<br />\"''No. I learned that if I focus, I can evade you without it.|Ahsoka Tano and Ezra Bridger|A Disarming Lesson}}\n[[File:Ezra_blocks_Ahsoka_attack-ADisarmingLesson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ezra blocks Ahsoka's attack]]\nAt some point after his first meeting with Ahsoka, Ezra was practicing alone with his lightsaber on a [[grass]]y planet, and she approached him and asked where he got his lightsaber. He explained that he built it himself, and gained his kyber crystal at the Lothal Jedi Temple with Master Yoda's guidance. Ahsoka examined the lightsaber, removing the crystal and asked him how it felt to have a lightsaber. Ezra responded that it made him feel powerful, and Ahsoka asked him if he still felt powerful without his lightsaber, before throwing his kyber crystal far into the grass. When a shocked Ezra asked her why she threw it away, she returned his crystal-less lightsaber and asked if he still felt powerful. He responded that he did not, which prompted Ahsoka to comment that she thought his weapon made him powerful. Ezra explained it did not make him feel powerful without the crystal.<ref name=\"A Disarming Lesson\">{{FOD|A Disarming Lesson}}</ref>\n\nAhsoka then advanced upon Ezra, igniting one of her own white lightsabers and a frightened Ezra asked her what she was doing as she approached. She swiped at his torso, which he dodged, and declared that she was teaching him. Ezra protested that Kanan never taught him this way, and she replied that it could be a new lesson and resumed her attack. Ezra dodged Ahsoka's lightsaber several times and complained he had no way to defend himself, to which Ahsoka retorted, \"Don't you?\" Ezra then began to scan his surroundings for the kyber crystal, while narrowly avoiding her assault. He asked how he could concentrate on finding his crystal while she kept attacking him, and Ahsoka agreed. Beginning to understand the lesson, he stopped frantically dodging the blows, closed his eyes and allowed the Force to guide him. Ezra evaded Ahsoka's next several strikes with ease before using the Force to [[Force jump|jump]] out of her range and near his kyber crystal. As Ahsoka advanced to his new position, he was able to find the crystal and insert it back into his lightsaber in time to ignite it and block her final attack. She observed that he needed his weapon after all. Ezra retorted that he hadn't needed it and explained to Ahsoka that she helped him that learn that if he focused, he could evade her without it. When asked why he got back his crystal in spite of that, Ezra admitted that he was getting tired and the pair shared a laugh together.<ref name=\"A Disarming Lesson\" />\n\n====Mission to Ibaar====\nLater, Ezra and his fellow rebels participated in a mission to transport relief supplies to the planet [[Ibaar]], which was blockaded by an Imperial fleet commanded by Agent Kallus. Following the failure of the first attempt which resulted in the destruction of a rebel transport and the death of the [[Phoenix Leader (Ibaar)|Phoenix Leader]], the crew of the ''Ghost'' embarked on a mission to contact the [[Mon Calamari]] engineer [[Quarrie]], who lived on the planet [[Shantipole]], which was inaccessible for many spacers. Quarrie had developed a prototype starfighter known as the [[Prototype B6|Blade Wing]], which could break the blockade. While Hera, Sabine, and Zeb traveled down to Shantipole on the ''Phantom'', Ezra along with Kanan and Chopper rendezvoused with a transport ship to pick up supplies for their second attempt to break the Imperial blockade at Ibaar.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\">{{Rebels|Wings of the Master}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jun_Sato_and_Quarrie.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bridger and his comrades with Quarrie after the blockade run on Ibaar]]\nWhile picking up supplies, Kanan told Ezra that in the event that Hera did not return, the ''Ghost'' would be used to transport the supplies. This alarmed Ezra since it would make the ''Ghost'' a target for the Empire. Despite the dangers, Kanan argued that the people of Ibaar was counting on them and they could not give up. Despite Kanan coming Hera, there was still no sign of her and the other crew when the ''Ghost'' and the rest of the Phoenix fleet converged on Ibaar. Fortunately for Ezra and the other ''Ghost'' crew, they were quickly joined by the ''Phoenix'', which was carrying the Blade on its back. Using the Blade Wing, Hera destroyed an ''Arquitens''-class light cruiser. This enabled the ''Ghost'' to travel through the gap in the Imperial blockade and drop its supplies down to the Ibaarians. Following the successful relief of Ibaar, Hera was promoted as the new [[Phoenix Leader]] at the recommendation of Kanan.<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" />\n\n====Mishap at Garel City====\nLater, Hera assigned Ezra to accompany Sabine and Chopper on a mission to pick up a courier carrying sensitive information at [[Garel City]]'s [[Garel City Spaceport|spaceport]]. While they did not know how the courier looked like, the rebels were told that the individual would respond to the code phrase: \"It's a long way to Alderaan.\" They were ordered to deliver the courier to a place called [[Havoc Outpost]]. On the way to the spaceport, Bridger voiced his views about Sabine's personal habits to her. He noted that she seemed to be a loner because she usually handled her missions alone and stayed in her room a lot. She also preferred to eat alone. However, Sabine did not respond since she was preoccupied with the mission. Sabine also noticed a strange but familiar symbol on the spaceport's wall.<ref name=\"Blood Sisters\">{{Rebels|Blood Sisters}}</ref>\n\nFor the next few hours, Ezra and Sabine greeted several disembarking passengers with the phrase \"It's a long way to Alderaan\" only to be met with blank stares. At the eleventh hour, Ezra discovered that the courier was a [[GNK-series power droid]] named [[EG-86]], who had come with the cargo. However, the three rebels were then cornered by the bounty hunter [[Ketsu Onyo]], a former friend of Sabine, who helped her escape the [[Imperial Academy of Mandalore|Imperial Academy]] on [[Mandalore]] and had fallen out with Sabine. Ketsu was now working for the crime syndicate [[Black Sun]] and had come to collect EG-86.<ref name=\"Blood Sisters\" />\n\n[[File:Hera_talks_to_Ketsu_and_Sabine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bridger and Syndulla greet Wren and Chopper as they return with Ketsu Onyo.]]\nHowever, Sabine was unwilling to allow Ketsu to take EG-86. Before a showdown could take place, the two parties were visited by a squad of stormtroopers. A three-way battle broke out and the rebels managed to board a shuttle with EG-86. While taking-off, Ezra was hit by laser fire and fell out of the shuttle's side door. While Sabine and Chopper continued the mission and managed to reach a truce with Ketsu, Ezra managed to escape the stormtroopers and make his way back to the ''Ghost''. After Sabine and Chopper completed the mission with Ketsu's help, Ezra and Hera were present to greet them at their Garel base. When Ezra tried to make conversation with both Sabine and Ketsu, the two girls indicated that they wanted to talk in a clique and kept Ezra out of the conversation.<ref name=\"Blood Sisters\" />\n\n====Escaping the Imperial Interdictor====\nFollowing the disappearance of a rebel patrol in the [[Del Zennis system]], Ezra accompanied [[Commander]] Jun Sato on a mission to find the lost patrol. Sato had brought Bridger along after Hera Syndulla suggested that his Jedi powers would be of help to the mission. While traveling through hyperspace, Bridger sensed a sudden disturbance in the Force. Shortly later, Sato's [[CR90 corvette]] [[Liberator (CR90 corvette)|''Liberator'']] was pulled out of hyperspace by an [[Imperial Interdictor]], a prototype warship equipped with four [[gravity well projector]]s. Commander Sato managed to send a distress signal before the corvette lost all power.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref>\n\nThe CR90 corvette was then dragged into the ventral hangar of the Imperial Interdictor and boarded by Imperial forces, who took them prisoner. Bridger and Commander Sato were then escorted by stormtroopers to the Interdictor's command bridge where they encountered the ship's commanding officer, [[Admiral]] [[Brom Titus]]. While Sato protested that they were members of the [[Corporate Alliance]], Titus was not fooled and quickly recognized him as Commander Sato. When Titus turned his attention to Bridger, the young rebel claimed that he was [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]]. However, Titus recognized him as Ezra Bridger and informed Agent Kallus of his catch.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\n[[File:Stealth_Strike_ep_guide.png|thumb|left|250px|Kanan and Rex reveal themselves to Ezra]]\nDespite Kallus' warnings not to underestimate the teenage Jedi, Admiral Titus was skeptical that Ezra could pose a threat to his ship and crew. However, he ordered three stormtroopers to escort Bridger to a secure cell. On the way, Bridger managed to free himself by using the Force to levitate his lightsaber-blaster from the leading stormtrooper's belt. After overpowering the stormtroopers, he locked them in his cell. Almost immediately, Ezra was approached by two stormtroopers and stunned them with his lightsaber-blaster. When Bridger spotted a disguised Chopper, he quickly realized that he had knocked out his master Kanan and the former Clone trooper Rex, who had been sent by Phoenix Leader Hera to rescue him, Sato, and Sato's crew.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\nWhen Kanan and Rex awoke, Bridger attempted to save face by claiming that they had been knocked out in a massive fire fight. However, Chopper rebutted his story by playing a recording of Bridger shooting them. While Kanan was outraged that his apprentice had shot him, Rex laughed it off. When Kanan and Rex got into an argument about how to proceed with their rescue mission, Ezra left to accompany Chopper on his mission to sabotage the Imperial Interdictor's gravity well projectors. Together, Ezra and Chopper reached the reactor core for the gravity wells.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\nSince the reactor core was being manned by several Imperial technicians, Chopper instructed Ezra to distract them. While Ezra grappled with the technicians, Chopper managed to access one of the terminals and turned off the gravity; preventing the technicians from firing on Ezra. After Chopper had completed his handy work, the droid switched back the gravity. The technicians plummeted but Ezra managed to grab a platform. Despite having his hand run over by Chopper's wheel, Ezra managed to keep up with his fellow rebel. Together, the two droids rejoined Kanan, Sato, and the other crew. While Kanan went back to rescue Rex, Ezra, Chopper, and the other rebels returned to the ''Liberator''.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\nOn Kanan's instructions, Sato disengaged his corvette from the Imperial Interdictor. After being joined by Kanan and Rex, the rebels prepared to jump into hyperspace. However, Admiral Brom ordered his crew to activate the Interdictor's gravity well projectors; pulling them out of hyperspace. When Ezra and the other rebels confronted Chopper, the astromech droid told them to wait. The Imperial Interdictor's gravity well projector then malfunctioned; causing two nearby Imperial light cruisers to collide with the warship and destroying them. Ezra and the rebels managed to avoid the ensuing explosion and fled into hyperspace. When Commander Sato thanked Kanan, Rex, and Ezra for saving him and his crew, Chopper pointed out that he had done most of the work. In response, Ezra mollified the astromech droid by telling him it was a team effort as well.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" />\n\n====Rescuing infants====\nLater, the Jedi Ahsoka Tano visited the crew of the ''Ghost'' on Garel. When she and Kanan withdrew to his private quarters, Ezra eavesdropped on their conversation. He learned that Ahsoka had been investigating the Inquisitors and had discovered that their secondary mission was to kidnap Force-sensitive infants. She had obtained two sets of coordinates. While she went to investigate the first, she assigned Kanan to look at the second set. Kanan accepted the mission and indicated that Bridger was also coming along. Ezra needed no briefing since he had been eavesdropping on Tano and Kanan's conversation.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\">{{Rebels|The Future of the Force}}</ref>\n\nAlong with Zeb and Chopper, Ezra and Kanan traveled on the ''Phantom'' to the planet [[Takobo]]. They quickly discovered that their coordinates led them to a housing unit in the settlement of [[Hammertown]]. While Ezra and Kanan went to investigate the housing unit, Zeb and Chopper stayed behind at the spaceport to search for any sign of the Inquisitors. Upon arriving there, they discovered that the housing unit was home to an [[Ithorian]] mother name [[Oora]]. Two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister had ransacked her home but she had sent her infant son [[Pypey]] into hiding with a courier [[droid]]. Ezra vowed to bring back her son.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\" />\n\nAfter Kanan commed Zeb, the two Jedi learned that Zeb and Chopper had discovered the Inquisitors' TIE Advanced v1 starfighters and rescued another infant named [[Alora]]. While Chopper babysat Alora, Zeb went to intercept the courier droid before the Inquisitors could get their hands on Pypey. Zeb managed to recover Pypey but was then pursued by the Inquisitors. Zeb fled to an apartment block and contacted Kanan and Ezra, who quickly traveled there to rejoin their companion. Upon arriving, Ezra spotted one of the Seventh Sister's ID9 seeker droids hovering nearby.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\" />\n\n[[File:Surrounded_by_Inquisitors.png|thumb|right|250px|Bridger, Jarrus, Orrelios, and Pypey being attacked by the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister]]\nAfter evading the seeker droid and the Inquisitors, Bridger and Kanan manged to rendezvous with Zeb in an apartment room. However, Bridger's presence unsettled the child since he could sense the teenager's fear. Alerted to their presence, the Inquisitors poked their lightsabers through the floor of the apartment. As they fled to the next room, Ezra struggled to calm the baby. The rebels then decided to split up. While Kanan and Zeb went to confront the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother, Ezra climbed into the ventilation shaft with Pypey, who was still wailing. Ezra finally managed to calm the child by connecting with Pypey through the Force.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\" />\n\nHowever, the Inquisitors had by that stage pinpointed his location and attempted to flush him out with their lightsabers. Before the Inquisitors could finish off their work, Kanan and Zeb arrived and took on them; giving Ezra the opportunity to escape the building with Pypey. While exiting the apartment block, Ezra commented that the child was welcome to visit them on Garel. Unknown to Bridger, his comments were picked up by the Sister's seeker droid. Ezra managed to reunite with Kanan and Zeb at the spaceport. Despite comming Chopper, they were unable to open the gates.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\" />\n\nThe Inquisitors then caught up with them and bested them in combat. Despite being outmatched, Ezra refused to give up Pypey. Before the Inquisitors could deal with him, Ahsoka exited the spaceport and bested the Inquisitors in a [[lightsaber duel]]. In the meantime, Ezra and his companions took the opportunity to flee aboard the ''Phantom''. They then rescued Ahsoka from an Imperial patrol and fled into hyperspace. While in space, Ezra learnt from Tano that a [[Children of the Force|similar attempt]] had been made to abduct children during the Clone Wars. Unknown to Ezra, the Inquisitors had learned through his offhand remark that the rebels were hiding on Garel.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\" />\n\n====Return to Lothal====\nWhile sleeping on his bunk aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra experienced a Force vision of his parents Ephraim and Mira Bridger and of an impending Imperial attack on Garel. During the vision, he also saw a [[White Loth-cat|white]] [[loth-cat]]. After falling out of his bed, Ezra alerted Hera and Kanan. Hera finally agreed to disclose what Tseebo had told her about Ezra's parents: his parents were alive but were imprisoned within the vast network of Imperial [[prison]]s that spanned the [[galaxy]]. Despite calling every favor from smugglers, rebels, and their contacts, Hera had been unable to pinpoint the exact location of Ezra's parents. Ezra thanked Hera for sharing this information and returned to his bunk to view a hologram of his parents.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nLater that morning, Hera and Kanan received word from Commander Sato that there had been a breakout at the Imperial prison on Lothal. The rebels had also obtained a list of the prisoners at the facility. Believing that one of the prisoners could help them find Ezra's parents, Kanan instructed his apprentice to use the Force to probe the list. Ezra closed in on an inmate known as Prisoner X-10. After Sabine informed that that she had received intelligence that the Imperial fleet was withdrawing from Lothal, Ezra took it as a sign that he should go to Lothal. Kanan convinced Ezra to let the rest of the crew of the ''Ghost'' come with him.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nSabine then commed the two remaining Spectres, Zeb and Chopper, to tell them to come aboard. Shortly later, Zeb and Chopper were pursued by several stormtroopers. This coincided with the appearance of an Imperial fleet above Garel City which had come to crush the rebel presence there. Ezra and Kanan helped Zeb and Chopper to board the ''Ghost'' by exchanging fire with their stormtrooper pursuers. When Agent Kallus arrived, Ezra used the Force to hurl Kallus and his men against the wall. At that point, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother arrived and goaded Ezra into attacking them. Before Ezra could strike them, Kanan used his blaster to shut the blast doors; separating the Inquisitors. This gave Ezra and his fellow Spectres the window they needed to escape aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nOnce airborne, Ezra along with Kanan and Chopper entered the ''Phantom'' and detached from the ''Ghost''. After spotting a gap in the Imperial fleet, the rebels took the chance to flee into hyperspace. After exiting hyperspace, Ezra and his companions landed the ''Phantom'' in Lothal's Capital City. They visited his old home only to discover that the Empire had razed it to the ground. While meditating through the Force, Ezra sensed the presence of the white loth-cat he had seen in his vision. He approached the cat, but the animal led him on a wild pursuit through the streets of Capital City. During the pursuit, Ezra used the Force to leap over buildings. Before Ezra could corner the animal, however, it fled on the back of a speeder bike into the wilderness. However, the Padawan managed to plant a [[locator]] on the speeder before it disappeared.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\n[[File:Ezra_sees_his_parents_through_the_Force.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra sees his recently deceased parents through the Force]]\nUsing the locator, Ezra and his rebel companions tracked the speeder bike and the loth-cat to a cluster of large hives outside Capital City. Shortly later, a hooded man whom Ezra recognized as Prisoner X-10 opened fire on him and Kanan. Ezra managed to placate the man by revealing he was the son of Ephraim and Mira Bridger. The man revealed himself as Ryder Azadi, the former Governor of Lothal who had been imprisoned for supporting the Bridgers' anti-Imperial broadcasts. Azadi revealed that Ezra's parents had heard his broadcast and had been inspired by it to stage a prison breakout. However, they had died during the escape attempt. Later that night, Ezra experienced another Force vision where he was visited by both his parents, who commended him for his achievements and urged him to stay strong. When Ezra related his vision to Kanan, his mentor told him that the Jedi believed that life did not end with death, but merely changed form in the Force. He also consoled Ezra by telling him that his parents would always be with him.<ref name=\"Legacy\" />\n\nFollowing their encounter with Ryder Azadi, Ezra and his master Kanan received instructions that Senator Bail Organa was delivering three [[Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette|''Sphyrna''-class Hammerhead corvettes]] to reinforce the Phoenix rebels' depleted forces. Since the [[Alderaanian]]s could not be seen directly supporting the rebels, Organa had sent his adopted daughter, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], to deliver the ships to the rebels on Lothal. As part of the plan, the crew of the ''Ghost'' would \"steal\" the ships while Leia was visiting Lothal under the pretext of carrying out a mercy mission. For this mission, Ezra disguised himself as an Imperial cadet while Kanan impersonated a stormtrooper.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>\n\nRyder elected to stay behind with Chopper in order to avoid drawing attention to himself. Ezra and Kanan headed to the Imperial depot at Jalath where they mingled among the garrison. Their mission was further complicated when the Imperial [[Supply Master]] Lyste fitted the Hammerhead corvettes with [[gravity lock]]s in an effort to deter thefts. Despite this unexpected setback, They managed to make contact with Leia and accompanied the Princess as she traveled on a rented [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] to carry out her relief mission. They then traveled back to Azadi's hiding place only to discover that several stormtroopers had arrested Ryder and Chopper.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nShortly later, Ezra's fellow rebels Zeb and Sabine arrived on the ''Ghost'' and a skirmish broke out with Imperial forces. During the fighting, Ezra managed to signal Sabine and Zeb that he and Kanan were disguised as an Imperial cadet and stormtrooper; thus avoiding being killed by friendly fire. To perpetuate the ruse that Princess Leia was still a loyal Imperial citizen, Ezra and his rebel comrades arranged for Ryder to \"kidnap\" Leia. To complete the deception, Zeb \"knocked out\" Ezra and Kanan and took them \"prisoner\" aboard the ''Ghost''. This development startled the Imperials who wondered whether the rebels had begun to take prisoners.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_and_the_Ghost_crew.png|thumb|right|250px|Bridger and the crew work alongside Princess Leia Organa]]\nBack aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra informed Hera, Sabine, and Zeb about the fate of his parents. While Ezra was gazing at a holographic image of his parents, Leia came and encouraged him by telling Ezra that she fought for those who could not fight. Galvanized by the princess' words, Ezra joined the other rebels in discussing their plan to \"steal\" the Hammerhead corvettes. Due to his expertise with gravity locks, Ryder agreed to assist with their operation. In order to infiltrate the Imperial depot, Ezra, Kanan, and Leia traveled there in the ''Phantom''. Still wearing their Imperial disguises, Ezra and Kanan claimed that they had rescued Leia from the rebels. Leia then perpetuated the hoax by telling Lyste that Kanan had saved her life and recommended that he receive a medal.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nMeanwhile Chopper, Sabine, and Ryder sneaked out of the ''Phantom'' and began disabling the gravity lock on the first ship. After disabling the lock, Sabine departed on the ship; sparking a [[Mission on Lothal|skirmish]] with the Imperial garrison. When Lyste and his Imperial troops spotted Chopper and Ryder, Ezra and Kanan used the Force to knock out the Imperials before they could fire on their comrades. This enabled Chopper and Ryder to unlock the second corvette; allowing Kanan to depart into space with the ship. Ezra protected Chopper while he was working on the third gravity lock by using the Force to snatch blasters from two stormtroopers. Leia then came to Ezra's aid by stunning the stormtroopers with her blaster. Ryder managed to depart on the third Hammerhead corvette.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\nAfter \"stealing\" the Hammerhead corvettes, Ezra bid farewell to Leia and promised that they would see each other again. To hide her rebel connections, Leia instructed Ezra to stun her, which he complied with. Ezra and Chopper then departed aboard the ''Phantom'' where they rejoined the Phoenix fleet, whose ranks had also been augmented by Ryder, who had had decided to join the rebel cause for the sake of both Ezra and his parents.<ref name=\"A Princess on Lothal\" />\n\n====Trouble at Concord Dawn====\n[[File:Concord_Dawn_planning.png|thumb|left|250px|Bridger present at the planning of the mission to Concord Dawn.]]\nEzra and Zeb were present in the command room of the ''Liberator'' when the crew of the ''Ghost'' received news of Hera and Sabine's failed [[Dogfight over Concord Dawn|mission]] to seek permission from the [[Mandalorian Protectors]] for safe passage through the [[Concord Dawn system]]. However, the Protectors' leader [[Fenn Rau]] had allied the Protectors with the Empire and had attacked Hera's mission, destroying several [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]]s. Hera was badly wounded during the attack and had to be hospitalized.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\">{{Rebels|The Protector of Concord Dawn}}</ref>\n\nWhen Sabine suggested destroying the Protectors' [[Fang-class|Fang fighters]] on the [[Third moon of Concord Dawn|third moon]] of [[Concord Dawn]], Ezra and Zeb expressed interest in accompanying Kanan for that mission. However, Kanan insisted only with Chopper to avoid endangering the other rebels. While Ezra and Zeb were upset, they complied with Kanan's orders. Chopper grumbled at the mission and punched Ezra with one of his arms in protest. Despite Kanan's orders, Sabine came along. Ultimately, the [[Mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|mission]] was a success and the rebels succeeded in not only destroying the Protectors' starfighters but also capturing Rau.<ref name=\"The Protector of Concord Dawn\" />\n\n====Rediscovery of Lira San====\nLater, Ezra received a tip from the pirate Hondo Ohnaka about two [[refugee]]s arriving on [[Nixus Hub 218]]. Hondo had supplied Ezra with a [[transmitter]] in order to keep touch with his former \"business partner.\" Ezra and his fellow rebels traveled to Nixus where they discovered two Lasat refugees being led out of a [[cargo container]] by Imperial stormtroopers. The crew of the ''Ghost'' quickly attacked the Imperials and freed the two Lasat, who turned out to be the female mystic [[Chava|Chava the Wise]] and the former [[Lasan High Honor Guard]]sman [[Gron]]; refugees who had survived the siege of Lasan. The two Lasat recognized Zeb as a former [[captain]] in the Lasan Honor Guard; something that Ezra and his fellow rebels were unaware about. Shortly later, Hondo turned up and identified himself as Ezra's contact.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\">{{Rebels|Legends of the Lasat}}</ref>\n\nWith Imperial reinforcements bound to appear, Ezra and his rebel companions made their way back to the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' hangar bay. When Ohnaka asked for the payment he was promised, Ezra refused; making Hondo \"proud\" of his young friend. While on their way to the ''Ghost'', Ezra asked the two Lasat about their travels. Chava told him that she and Gron were traveling to [[Lira San]], a legendary world described in an [[Prophecy of the Three|ancient prophecy]] as a safe system where the Lasat could start anew. Zeb scoffed at the prophecy and was despondent about his people's future. Ezra then received a message on his transmitter from Hondo warning him about Imperial stormtroopers. Shortly later, Ezra and his rebel companions were attacked by stormtroopers. The rebels fought back and managed to board the ''Ghost'' with the help of Ohnaka, who sealed several exits in order to delay the Imperials.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nThe ''Ghost'' then jumped into hyperspace before an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] captained by Agent Kallus could intercept it. Once the ''Ghost'' was in hyperspace, Chava embarked on a ritual designed to reveal the location of Lira San, a fabled world which did not appear in any official star charts. Chava believed in an ancient Lasat prophecy that Lira San would only be revealed if the \"child of prophecy\" saved the \"warrior\" and the \"fool.\" While Ezra was willing to participate in the ritual, Zeb would have none of it and retired to his quarters. Puzzled by his friend's reluctance, Bridger went to talk with Zeb, who confided his guilt in failing to protect his people and the [[Royal family of Lasan]] during the Fall of Lasan. Ezra comforted Zeb by telling him that he could still protect his people by helping Chava and Gron find Lira San.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\n[[File:Legends_of_the_Lasat_thumb.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra with his fellow rebels and their Lasat passengers Chava and Gron]]\nDue to Ezra's encouragement, Zeb reluctantly agreed to participate in the ritual. As part of the ritual, Chopper displayed a holographic projection of [[the galaxy]]. Chopper then activated his [[bo-rifle]] in the ancient Lasat style, causing it to fire a beam that interacted with Chava's staff. This beam created a surge of energy on Chopper's map that pinpointed to a set of coordinates in [[Wild Space]], an uncharted region beyond the Outer Rim Territories. Ezra and his fellow crew then traveled to the coordinates only to find their path obstructed by a collapsed [[star cluster]]. Any starship approaching that maelstrom could be destroyed by the gravitational pull of the star cluster.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nThe rebels' problems were further compounded when Agent Kallus' light cruiser resurfaced and issued an ultimatum that the rebels surrender or be destroyed. At that point, Zeb realized that it was his destiny to lead the way to Lira San. He used his bo-rifle to take control of the ship's controls and shepherd the ''Ghost'' through the maelstrom. Kallus sent two TIE fighters to pursue the ''Ghost'' but these were ripped apart by the gravitational tide of the star cluster. The Imperial light cruiser also opened fire on the ''Ghost'' but each of its blasts missed the rebel ship. Upon approaching the star cluster, the ''Ghost'' miraculously jumped into hyperspace. Ezra and his fellow crew were knocked unconscious by the bright blast of the cluster.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\nUpon awakening, Ezra and his companions found themselves in unknown space but sighted Lira San in the horizon. Ezra was woken up by Chopper who rolled over his hand with one his wheel-legs. While Ezra and the other rebels stayed aboard the ''Ghost'', Zeb along with Chava and Gron traveled to Lira San. There, they discovered that the planet was the original Lasat homeworld and that it was already home to millions of Lasat. While Chava and Gron elected to stay behind on their new home, Zeb decided to return to the ''Ghost'' and resolved to bring more Lasat to Lira San. Ezra and his companions then departed Lira San via a safe route that Hera had plotted through the star cluster.<ref name=\"Legends of the Lasat\" />\n\n====Joining forces with the purrgil====\nEzra and his fellow rebels traveled to a [[Mining Guild]] [[Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery]] to obtain fuel supplies for the ''Ghost'' and the fleet. While traveling to their destination, Ezra heard high-pitched cries around the ''Ghost''. Ezra and his fellow crew quickly realized that the cries were coming from a herd of [[purrgil]], space creatures that were capable of traveling through hyperspace. The purrgil surrounded the ''Ghost'' and unnerved Hera, who had a dislike for the space creatures. However, Ezra instead convinced Hera to travel in the same direction as the purrgil. This had the effect of calming the space creatures.<ref name=\"The Call\">{{Rebels|The Call}}</ref>\n\nThrough the Force, Ezra sensed that the purrgil were sad and were trying to communicate with the crew. Shortly later, the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' sensors picked up two [[TIE/mg Mining Guild starfighter]]s which proceeded to attack the purrgil herd. At Kanan's insistence, the crew of the ''Ghost'' came to the aid of the purrgil. During a brief dogfight, Ezra managed to shoot down one of the TIEs while his master claimed another. After Sabine tracked down the TIEs to the asteroid gas refinery, Ezra and his fellow rebels quickly realized that the purrgil were also traveling to the same destination.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nIn private, Hera confided with Ezra about her prejudices towards the purrgil. She disliked the purrgil because they endangered hyperspace travel by colliding into starships. Hera also told Ezra that she had lost more than one friend to them. In response, Ezra suggested that purrgil were ignorant of the damage they were causing. Shortly later, the crew of the ''Ghost'' arrived at an asteroid overlooking the gas refinery and parked there. Ezra also attended the briefing where Hera and Sabine outline their plans to infiltrate the facility and steal the gas canisters. The rebels would also destroy the facility by using [[detonator]]s to ignite the volatile [[Clouzon-36]] gas around the refinery in order to deny it to the Empire. Ezra was too distracted by the purrgil to concentrate on the briefing. Before leaving, he attempted to tell Hera that the purrgil were interested in the gas but the captain told him to focus on his mission.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nWhile at the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' gangplank, Ezra asked how they were going to get down; prompting a reprimand from Sabine for not paying attention. Since they were jumping into a toxic atmosphere in the [[Unidentified planetoid (Mining Guild)|planetoid]] below, Ezra and the other rebels with the exception of Chopper had to don helmets. Together with Kanan, Chopper, and Sabine, Ezra jumped onto the refinery below. While the other rebels managed to land on the bridge, Ezra miscalculated and almost fell into the gassy atmosphere below. However, Kanan used the Force to pull him up and reprimanded his apprentice.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\n[[File:The_Call_thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra was able to bond with the purrgil through the Force.]]\nShortly later, Ezra and his fellow rebels were attacked by several Rodian Mining Guild guards. Under Kanan's orders, Sabine activated the detonators but was stopped by Ezra. As they made their way through the facility, Ezra uses the Force to throw down a Rodian gunner. When confronted by his comrades, Ezra told them that the purrgil were connected to the gas. Changing their plans, Kanan ordered Ezra to man the gun emplacement while the other rebels secured the landing zone. During the ensuing skirmish, Ezra used his cannon to knock out one of the other gun emplacements and to drive away the security guards. This enabled his fellow rebels to secure the landing platform and Hera and Zeb to land.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nWhile the other rebels were loading the gas canisters and recharging the ''Ghost'', Ezra was hit by a laser blast and plummeted into the gassy atmosphere below. When he awoke he found himself in a toxic atmosphere. Ezra tried to reach for his helmet but it toppled into the abyss below. However, a tentacle grabbed it and Ezra discovered that he had been rescued by the [[Purrgil King]]. After donning his helmet, Ezra stared into the eyelid of the Purrgil King and was able to make a Force connection with it. Through this connection, Ezra learned that the purrgil depended on the Clouzon-36 gas to survive and to travel into hyperspace.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\nTogether with the purrgil herd, Ezra came to his fellow rebels' rescue and managed to defeat the Mining Guild security forces. Ezra's arrival was timely since the Mining Guild [[Boss]] [[Yushyn]] was on the verge of crushing the rebels. While riding on the Purrgil King, Ezra used his lightsaber to slash off the wing radiator of a TIE fighter, causing it to explode. After stealing the gas canisters, the crew of the ''Ghost'' destroyed the gas refinery and fled into space. Ezra and the purrgil herd later rejoined the rebels in space. He greeted his Master Kanan and informed of the bond that he managed to established with the purrgil. Once safely aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra and his fellow crew watched as the purrgil jumped into hyperspace. Since Hera had overcome her animosity towards the space creatures, she announced that the ''Ghost'' would travel with them.<ref name=\"The Call\" />\n\n====Mission to Ryloth====\n[[File:The_crew_of_the_Ghost.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ezra (second from the right) and his fellow rebels following the successful Ryloth heist]]\nFollowing the loss of the [[starfighter]] pilot [[Phoenix Two]] during a skirmish with Imperial forces, the group's leadership realized that it needed a safe place to land their starfighters. After Commander Sato received intelligence that an Imperial [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|fighter carrier]] was orbiting the [[Twi'lek]] homeworld of [[Ryloth]], Ezra took part in a [[Mission to Ryloth (Phoenix Squadron)|mission]] to steal the fighter carrier. For this operation, the Spectres teamed up with [[Cham Syndulla]], the leader of the [[Free Ryloth Movement|Ryloth rebels]] and Hera's father. Cham was also accompanied by two comrades [[Numa]] and [[Gobi Glie]]. The two rebel cells rendezvoused in space aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Homecoming\">{{Rebels|Homecoming}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the meeting, Ezra's master Kanan was tense about meeting Hera's father and took it out on Ezra. Kanan's initial anxieties were dispelled when Cham praised Ezra and his fellow rebels as a \"fine group of fighters.\" Ezra later attended a briefing where Hera outlined her plan to steal the fighter carrier, which involved using a stolen [[TIE/sa bomber]] to infiltrate the starship. However, Cham urged the rebels to destroy the fighter carrier since it had been used to terrorize Ryloth and to demonstrate the Ryloth rebels' strength. In the end, Cham agreed to support Hera's plan after Hera pointed out that the two cells depended on each other for the mission to succeed.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nFollowing the briefing, Ezra asked Hera about her relationship with her father while she was repairing Chopper. Hera revealed that she and Cham had not spoken for years due to their differences about her joining the rebellion rather than fighting for Ryloth's freedom. She explained that Cham had spent his whole life fighting both the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]] and the Galactic Empire. After her [[Eleni Syndulla|mother]] died, Cham devoted his whole life to freeing Ryloth from Imperial rule and neglected his own daughter. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Cham, who informed the rebels that they should be getting ready for their mission. Ezra then exited the room but not before muttering that family was always more important.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nLater, as the two rebel groups traveled to Ryloth, Cham regaled Ezra and the other rebels with stories about his exploits during the Clone Wars. After exiting hyperspace, the rebels moved into their TIE bomber and flew towards the fighter carrier. As planned, two A-wing fighters emerged from hyperspace and attacked the rebel TIE bomber. Feigning distress, Hera was able to secure landing rights on the carrier. After they crash-landed on the hangar bay, Cham and his comrades turned on Ezra and the other rebels and stunned them. The Ryloth rebels then proceeded with their original plan to destroy the fighter carrier.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nAfter they awoke and managed to free themselves, Ezra and Sabine informed Hera that they had spotted the Twi'leks carrying a bag of detonators. The rebels then resolved to stop Cham and his associates from destroying the carrier. While Sabine and Zeb went to deal with Numa and Gobi, Ezra and the other rebels made their way to the command bridge after dodging several stormtroopers and [[blast door]]s. Having reached the command bridge, Ezra used a Jedi [[mind trick]] to force the Imperial commander to order a general evacuation of the ship. Meanwhile, Sabine and Zeb managed to subdue Numa and Gobi.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nLater, Ezra and his companions encountered Cham on the command bridge, who had sabotaged the ship's [[hyperdrive]]. Following a lengthy argument, Hera managed to win over her father by telling her that he had inspired her to join the rebellion. The two rebel groups subsequently abandoned their differences and joined forces to keep Imperial reinforcements from retaking the ship. While Chopper repaired the hyperdrive, Ezra and Cham headed to the hangar bay where they joined forces with Sabine to shove a TIE bomber into the direction of an approaching Imperial light cruiser. The bomber collided with the light cruiser's magazine section, causing the Imperial ship to explode. Meanwhile, the rebels escaped with the fighter carrier safely into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\nAfter stealing the Imperial fighter carrier and bringing it into deep space, Ezra and the other rebels bid farewell to Cham and his Twi'lek rebels in the carrier's hangar bay. Hera and her father had reconciled and the two rebels had put aside their differences. As a result of their joint cooperation, the Spectres developed ties with the Ryloth resistance movement.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" />\n\n====Mission to Geonosis====\n[[File:The_rebels_arrive_at_Geonosis.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra and the rest of the ''Ghost''s crew arrive at the Geonosis construction field]]\nLater, Ezra and his fellow rebels along with Rex participated in a [[Ambush on an Imperial construction module|mission]] to [[Geonosis]] to investigate an [[ICM-092792|Imperial construction module]]. After arriving in the system, Chopper picked up no life readings from Geonosis; a planet that was home to billions of [[Geonosian]]s. Ezra then sensed through the Force that all life on Geonosis had somehow been extinguished. Upon landing in the seemingly abandoned station, Ezra along with Kanan, Zeb, and Sabine ventured inside while Hera, Rex, and Chopper stayed aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\">{{Rebels|The Honorable Ones}}</ref>\n\nEzra and his fellow rebels quickly discovered that they had stumbled into an Imperial ambush set by Agent Kallus, a perennial foe of the Spectres. Following a skirmish, Ezra along with Kanan and Sabine managed to escape back aboard the ''Ghost'' due to the efforts of Chopper to unlock the blast doors. However, Zeb was separated and ended up with Kallus in an escape pod. Once in space, the ''Ghost'' led Imperial forces on a pursuit around Geonosis. After escaping the Imperials, Ezra told Chopper to scan Zeb's trajectory. When the astromech droid protested, Ezra slammed his metal head and told Chopper not to be a \"sleemo.\"<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\" />\n\nLater, Ezra flew with Kanan in the ''Phantom'' on a sweep of Geonosis but were unable to find any sign of Zeb. Meanwhile, Zeb and Kallus managed to land safely on the icy moon [[Bahryn]] where they struck up an unlikely friendship to survive the cold and several [[bonzami]] predators. After repairing his [[Escape pod transponder|transponder]], Zeb was detected by his fellow rebels who traveled to Bahryn to pick him up. Ezra and his fellow rebels greeted Zeb on the gangplank. When Bridger complained about the cold, Zeb responded that he had only been there for two seconds; prompting Ezra to respond that two seconds was already too long for him.<ref name=\"The Honorable Ones\" />\n\n====Return to the Lothal temple====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Ezra_fight_the_Inquisitors.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra and Kanan duel the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister on Oosalon]]\nEzra along with Kanan and Chopper traveled to the stormy planet of [[Oosalon]] to scout for a permanent base that the rebellion could use. However, their mission was complicated by the arrival of the two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister who [[Duel on Oosalon|clashed]] with them. During the duel, Ezra was knocked over the edge of the cliff by the Fifth Brother but he managed to cling on to Kanan. The two Jedi managed to escape after Ezra used his Force powers to summon a [[tibidee]] which carried them to safety. Shortly later, Chopper arrived with the ''Phantom'' and picked them up.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\">{{Rebels|Shroud of Darkness}}</ref>\n\nOnce in space, Ezra and Kanan discussed the threat of the Inquisitors to their efforts to help the rebellion to establish a permanent base. To avoid endangering the fleet, Kanan arranged for the ''Ghost'' to rendezvous with the ''Phantom'' in deep space. After returning to the ''Ghost'', Ezra met up with Ahsoka Tano in a cabin. Ahsoka showed Ezra a holographic recording of her late master Anakin Skywalker, who was skilled in [[lightsaber combat]]. Shortly later, Kanan entered the room and discussed the threat posed by the Inquisitors to the rebellion. After some discussion, Kanan and Ahsoka decided that they should visit the Jedi Temple on Lothal to seek answers.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\nUpon arriving on Lothal, Ezra and the other Jedi made their way to the Jedi Temple while Chopper stayed behind to guard the ''Phantom''. Ezra and Kanan used their Force powers to levitate the Temple open, causing it to reveal another entrance. Once inside the Temple, the three Jedi experienced different visions of the Force depending on their needs and circumstances. While Kanan encountered several spectral [[Jedi Temple Guard]]s, Ezra asked Ahsoka about her recollections of Yoda; he had heard Yoda's voice the last time but had never seen Yoda face to face. While they were speaking, Ezra disappeared and found himself in the same chamber where he had spoken to Yoda earlier.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\n[[File:Ezra_speaks_with_Yoda.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra seeks guidance from Yoda]]\nSince his Force powers had grown, Ezra was able to see Yoda this time; recognizing him as a small, green-skinned alien. Yoda noted that Ezra's powers were growing but warned the young Padawan that it would also attract danger. When Ezra asked Yoda whether he had the power to destroy Vader and the Inquisitors, Yoda related how the Jedi Order's eagerness to participate in the [[Clone Wars]] had brought about its demise. When Ezra asked whether it was wrong for a Jedi to fight or to protect his friends, Yoda explained that he too had fought for many years but was consumed by fear. After Ezra expressed surprise that Yoda was once consumed by fear, Yoda counseled him that it was a lifelong challenge to prevent fear from bending into anger.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\nEzra's conversation with Master Yoda was interrupted by the arrival of the Inquisitors, who used their dark side powers to force the temple open. Before leaving, Ezra asked Yoda how the Jedi could expect to win if they do not fight back. Yoda responded that the real question was how a Jedi should choose to win, to which Ezra responded that they had already chosen to fight. Yoda then reluctantly told Ezra to find [[Malachor]] before leaving. After awakening from his vision, Ezra joined his companions in fleeing the Jedi Temple before the Inquisitors closed in on them. Fortunately for them, the Inquisitors were held back by several spectral Temple Guards.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\nAfter escaping the Temple, Ezra and his fellow Jedi were picked up by Chopper in the ''Phantom''. Once aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra told Kanan and Ahsoka that Master Yoda had told him to find Malachor and asked who Malachor was. Ahsoka responded by revealing that Malachor was not a person but rather a planet. Ezra and his companions' visit to Lothal attracted the attention of Darth Vader who vowed to stop the Jedi.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" />\n\n====Heist at Horizon Base====\n[[File:Horizon_Base.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra took part in a heist at Horizon Base.]]\nWith the Phoenix Squadron's fighter-carrier lacking sufficient fuel to travel to the [[Yost system]], Ezra and his fellow rebels took part in a [[Heist at Horizon Base|mission]] to raid an Imperial depot at [[Horizon Base]] for fuel. Earlier, the rebel leadership had identified [[Berzite]]'s [[Berzite's moon|moon]] in the Yost system as a prospective location for a rebel base. While Ezra and the other rebels made their way to the depot, Chopper was instructed to stay with the ''Ghost'' and keep any eye for Imperial activities. When Chopper coveted a [[Ambulatory strut|droid leg]] on sale at a nearby stall, Ezra and Zeb taunted the droid; with Ezra making a snide remark about Chopper going \"shopping.\"<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\">{{Rebels|The Forgotten Droid}}</ref>\n\nEzra and the other rebels approached the depot and found it heavily guarded. Despite Kanan's orders to get the fuel \"quietly with no complications,\" Ezra and his companions still managed to attract the attention of the local stormtrooper garrison. They managed to flee back to the ''Ghost'' with enough fuel supplies. However, Chopper was nowhere to be found since he was visiting the stall. With the Imperials closing in on them, Ezra and his companions were forced to leave Chopper behind.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nDespite his acrimonious relationship with Chopper, Ezra was still concerned enough to speak up for the astromech droid. While traveling through hyperspace, Ezra urged the crew to go back for Chopper. However, Hera ruled that out because she was angry with Chopper's selfishness and was more concerned about getting the fuel back to the fleet. Upon arriving, they discovered that the Phoenix rebel fleet was under [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (3 BBY)|attack]] by Imperial forces under Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]]. Despite intense enemy fire, the ''Ghost'' managed to dock in the fighter-carrier with the help of Ketsu Onyo, Sabine's friend.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\nAfter disembarking, Ezra and Zeb helped to unload the fuel canisters. Shortly later, Hera was contacted by Chopper, who had managed to befriend the Imperial [[inventory droid]] [[AP-5]] and hijack an [[Class four container transport|Imperial cargo ship]]. AP-5 managed to warn the rebels that the Empire had set a trap in the Yost system and instead gave them the coordinates for an alternative world called [[Atollon]], which lacked an Imperial presence. Using this information, the rebel fleet was able to flee to Atollon. Ezra and his companions including Chopper were later present when Sabine finished her repairs to AP-5 by using spare parts from Chopper's stolen droid leg. Ezra also witnessed a brief verbal exchange between Chopper and AP-5.<ref name=\"The Forgotten Droid\" />\n\n====Establishing a new base====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Ezra_lightsaber_practice.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra and Kanan practicing with their lightsabers]]\nFollowing the discovery of Atollon, the Phoenix Squadron established a rebel base on the planet called [[Chopper Base]]. Ezra and his fellow crew aided in the establishment of the base by ferrying power generators from the fleet down to the planet. While the ''Ghost'' was delivering power generators to Chopper Base, Ezra and his master Kanan took the opportunity to practice their lightsaber skills. The training session ended in a draw but his master reminded him there was no such thing in a real fight. When Ezra remarked that they won by killing Inquisitors, Kanan responded that they did so by staying alive.<ref name=\"Mystery\">{{Rebels|The Mystery of Chopper Base}}</ref>\n\nEzra was annoyed when Sabine said that his lightsaber skills were getting better since it implied that he was still not good enough. Hera then reassured Ezra that he was good with the lightsaber. Kanan then interrupted the conversation to remind his apprentice not \"to turn his back on the enemy.\" The two Jedi then returned to their lightsaber sparring session. After landing at Chopper Base, the Spectres delivered their power generators to AP-5, the former Imperial inventory droid who had now joined the rebellion.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nLater that day, Chopper bumped into Ezra on the ''Ghost'', causing him to stumble. When Ezra asked where Zeb was, the astromech droid pointed in the direction of nearby cliff overlooking the desert. Upon arriving there, Ezra found Zeb relaxing and listening to some music while watching the sun setting. When Ezra told Zeb that he was about to leave and confided his fears that they would never meet again, Zeb reassured the young Jedi by joking that the rebels would have overthrown the Empire by the time that Kanan and Ezra had returned. He suggested that they could share war stories after their return.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nThat evening, Ezra and his fellow rebels responded to a distress call from Sabine and Rex, who were checking the northern perimeter. Another rebel named Lieutenant [[Dicer]] had disappeared while planting a [[sensor beacon]] there and Sabine and Rex had gone to investigate. Upon arriving, the rebels had found themselves under attack from the [[krykna]], large spidery creatures that inhabited the tunnels beneath the deserts of Atollon. Ezra and his companions managed to rescue Sabine but Rex was captured by the krykna.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nWhile exploring the tunnels, Ezra and Kanan split up from the other rebels to search for Rex. Ezra and his master quickly ran into a krykna. Ezra attempted to establish a Force connection with the creature but the creature attacked them; forcing Kanan to kill it. When Ezra protested, Kanan chastised his apprentice for lacking common sense. Ezra and Kanan managed to rejoin their companions who had managed to rescue Rex from the lair. After fighting off krykna pursuers, the rebels managed to escape back to the ''Ghost'' where they rejoined Chopper, who was guarding the ship.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nThe rebels attempted to escape aboard the ''Ghost'' but they were held down by a large web woven by the krykna. As the spider-like creatures attempted to storm the ship, Ezra along with Kanan and Zeb used the ship's [[laser cannon]]s to fight off the intruders. With the ship trapped under the krykna's webs, Ezra suggested venturing out of the ship to slice through it. When Zeb expressed a reluctance to face the krykna, Ezra angrily retorted that he did not want the last Jedi in the galaxy to end up in the belly of the creatures. After Sabine realized that the krykna avoided the sensor marker, the rebels came up with plan to distract the creatures while they escaped.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nPutting their plans into action, Ezra and Kanan used the Force to hurl Sabine towards the sensor marker. However, they over-calculated and the Mandalorian fell into a nearby pit. Despite falling into the pit, Sabine managed to return to the ''Ghost'' with the sensor marker. Ezra and his master then used their lightsabers to slice through the krykna webs. Their actions allowed the ''Ghost'' to break free of the web and return to the safety of Chopper base. Unwilling to give up the base, the rebels decided to fence off the northern perimeter with sensor markers to keep the krykna at bay.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\nThe following day, Ezra made a second attempt to make contact with the krykna but the Force had no effect on them. Shortly later, he was joined by Ahsoka, who explained that the Force became more mysterious as one learned more about it. After chatting, the two returned back to the camp to make preparations with Kanan for their journey to Malachor.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />\n\n====Mission to Malachor====\n=====The \"Old Master\"=====\nTogether with Ahsoka, Kanan, and Chopper, Ezra traveled on the ''Phantom'' to the planet Malachor to seek knowledge on how to defeat the [[Sith]]. During the hyperspace journey, Ezra asked his master Kanan why their friend Rex was worried about them going to Malachor. Kanan and Ahsoka explained that Malachor was considered off-limits by the Jedi. When Ezra queried why Master Yoda would send them to such a place, Kanan suggested that Malachor might have something that would help them to stop the Inquisitors. Tano then added that they were seeking knowledge that would help them to defeat the Inquisitors' Sith masters.<ref name=\"Twilight\">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>\n\nAfter descending into Malachor's atmosphere, Chopper reported the presence of another starship. As soon as the ''Phantom'' had passed through the clouds, Ezra spotted a circular stonehenge of monoliths in the distance. Upon landing, Ezra along with Kanan and Tano inspected the monoliths, which were inscribed with writings in an [[Unidentified ancient script|ancient tongue]]. Despite Ahsoka's warnings, Ezra touched one of the monoliths; causing the Jedi and Tano to slide into an underground cavern. There, the three travelers spotted a large pyramidal [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith temple]] in the distance. When Chopper issued a belated warning about the slip-in, Ezra sarcastically thanked the droid.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n[[File:The_temple.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ezra, Kanan, and Ahsoka find the Sith temple]]\nWhile approaching the Sith temple, Ezra and his mentors stumbled upon an ancient battlefield from the [[Great Scourge of Malachor]]. The battlefield was littered with fallen lightsabers and the statue-like corpses of the belligerents. From Tano, Ezra learned that the Jedi and Sith had fought on Malachor a long time ago and that both sides had been destroyed. When Kanan hurried them, Ezra was about to make a snide remark about his master when he suddenly spotted one of the statues moving. This \"statue\" turned out to be the Inquisitor known as the [[Eighth Brother]]. The Inquisitor attacked Ezra and his companions.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nDuring the fighting, the Inquisitor fired several bolts with his [[Double-bladed spinning lightsaber]]; causing the ground beneath Ezra to cave in. Ezra was separated from his companions, who pursued the Eighth Brother. Once underground, Ezra encountered a mysterious elderly man who called himself the \"Old Master.\" This Old Master was actually the former Sith apprentice [[Maul]], who had become stranded on Malachor several years earlier after his ship crashed. While Ezra initially distrusted the stranger, he agreed to let the Old Master leader him to the temple after he revealed that he was also after the same knowledge that would allow them to destroy the Sith.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n[[File:Maul_and_Ezra.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra meets the \"Old Master\"]]\nWhile traveling, Ezra befriended the Old Master, who described himself as an enemy of the Inquisitors and their Sith masters. Ezra was able to relate Maul's tragic experience with the Sith to his own experience with the Empire. Upon reaching the temple, the two Force-wielders used their Force powers to force its heavy stone doors open, which Maul realize upon seeing Ezra that they must embrace [[Rule of Two]]. At the urging of Maul, Ezra tapped into the dark side in order to force their way inside the Temple. One inside the temple's sanctum, Ezra and Maul teamed up to reach the [[Sith holocron (Malachor)|Sith holocron]], which was nestled on a high altar. After a challenging physical ordeal, the two managed to acquire the holocron. Ezra also came to trust Maul after the Force-wielder used his Force powers to levitate him to safety after he had jumped down from the altar.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n=====A brush with the dark side=====\nAfter obtaining the holocron, Ezra and Maul encountered Kanan and Ahsoka fighting the Eighth Brother and two other Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister. Despite driving off the Inquisitors, Kanan and Tano were distrustful of Maul. However, Ezra defended Maul and argued they could trust him because he believed Maul's claim that he wanted to use the holocron's knowledge to destroy the Sith. Maul convinced the Jedi and Tano to join forces to bring the holocron to the top of the temple to access this knowledge and to fight Darth Vader, who had been alerted by the Inquisitors to the presence of the Jedi and Maul.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nWhile making their way to the top of the Sith temple, Kanan pulled Ezra aside at an opportune moment and warned his apprentice that Maul could not be trusted. In response, Ezra defended Maul for realizing his potential as a Force-wielder and accused Kanan of holding his Jedi training back. Shortly later, Ezra was attacked by the Eighth Brother who tried to obtain the Sith holocron. Maul drove off the Inquisitor and convinced the Jedi to split up so that they could delay their opponents. Despite Kanan's disapproval, Ezra agreed to accompany Maul to the top of the Sith temple.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n[[File:Seventh_Sister_choked.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Maul commands Ezra to strike down the Seventh Sister]]\nDuring the journey, Maul tried to sow discord between Ezra and Kanan by telling the boy that he understood his potential. On the way, they were attacked by the Seventh Sister and her ID9 seeker droids. Ezra and Maul managed to defeat the Sister and her droids. Holding her in a Force-grip, Maul urged Ezra to strike the Inquisitor. When Ezra refused, the former Sith killed the Seventh Sister and then admonished Ezra for his hesitancy; warning him that it could cost him or his friends their lives next time. Maul then told Ezra to continue his journey to the temple's obelisk while he went to \"help\" Kanan and Ahsoka deal with the other Inquisitors.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nEzra complied with Maul's instructions and managed to reach the top of the Sith temple. There, he planted the holocron into the obelisk and was greeted by a feminine entity known as the \"[[Presence]]\"; who told him that the Temple contained the power to destroy all life. When Ezra protested that this was not what he wanted, Presence told him that she would share the power with someone else more worthy. As Ezra attempted to flee, he was cornered by Darth Vader, who had arrived in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter to access the Temple's knowledge on behalf of the Sith.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n[[File:InfuseTheForce-CM.png|thumb|left|250px|Together, Ezra and Kanan remove the holocron from the obelisk.]]\nEzra briefly fought with Vader but was overpowered by the Sith Lord, who destroyed his lightsaber. Before Vader could finish Ezra off, he was joined by Ahsoka. Earlier, Maul had killed the Inquisitors but then betrayed Kanan by blinding him. Despite his blindness, Kanan managed to used his Force powers to push Maul into a chasm. Kanan also instructed Ahsoka to help Ezra. While Vader and Ahsoka fought with their lightsabers, Ezra and his blinded master Kanan worked together to remove the holocron from the temple's explosive; triggering a chain reaction that led to the Sith temple's implosion.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nAs the Sith temple closed in on itself, Ezra and Kanan tried to reach Chopper and the ''Phantom'' but were held back by Vader. However, Ahsoka intervened and gave enough time for Ezra and his companions to escape on the ''Phantom''. Ahsoka, however, was unable to join them and was trapped inside the temple with Vader. After the temple imploded, Ezra and Kanan assumed that Tano had perished. During the journey, Ezra wept, prompting Kanan to comfort him. Upon returning to Chopper Base, Ezra and Kanan greeted their fellow rebels including Rex who were saddened by the loss of Ahsoka. Later, after settling back on the ''Ghost'', Ezra opened the Sith holocron in his room.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n====Rescuing Hondo====\n[[File:Rebels_Season_3_Crash_Course.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra led a mission to rescue Hondo.]]\nTwo years before the [[Battle of Yavin]],{{Fact}} Ezra Bridger led the Spectres on a mission to free his one-time partner, Hondo Ohnaka, from the [[Naraka prison|Imperial prison]] on the planet [[Naraka]]. Hondo had promised to supply the rebels with valuable intelligence in return for his rescue. While Hera waited aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra and his team climbed under the bridge leading to the prison. After Ezra and Zeb dispatched two stormtroopers, he signaled for Chopper to join them and Sabine. To avoid triggering the Imperial sensor lights, Chopper threw himself down the cliff instead of activating his thruster. Ezra managed to levitate the droid above the light using the Force before letting him go and allowing Zeb to catch him.<ref name=\"Steps\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>\n\nTogether, the rebels made their way inside the prison and found Hondo's cell. Upon opening the cell, Ezra and his team learned that Hondo had an [[Ugnaught]] companion named [[Terba]], who had been the original source of his information. After a brief exchange, the rebels were attacked by stormtroopers, prompting Ezra to contact Hera and tell her to bring the ''Ghost'' to the landing platform for a \"[[44 scoop]].\" The rebels soon fled down a [[turbolift]], and after exiting, Ezra and Sabine shot down several stormtroopers. Ezra also used his [[Ezra's second lightsaber|new green lightsaber]] to cut down several stormtroopers who were blocking their way out. The rebels continued on to the exit but Terba broke away from the company and ran ahead. Exiting the building into the view of an AT-DP, the Ugnaught was struck dead by a blast from the walker's cannon.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nThe rebels found themselves trapped between Imperial forces on both sides. While Sabine and Chopper dealt with the Imperials behind them, Ezra used the Force to control the AT-DP's pilot, forcing him to attack his own comrades and jump off the edge of the platform. When Sabine asked when Kanan had taught him that power, Ezra replied that he had not. In secret, he had been delving into the Sith holocron and learning the powers of the dark side. After Imperial reinforcements arrived from inside the prison, Ezra ordered his team to jump onto the ''Ghost''{{'s}} hull while it flew under the platform, allowing the group to escape the planet.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nOnce safely aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra and Zeb met with Hera in the cockpit. Zeb told Hera indirectly that the youth had used a mind trick to manipulate the AT-DP pilot. When Hera chastised Ezra for losing Terba, Ezra responded that he was only responsible for the details that he knew and proceeded to storm out. Once inside his room, Ezra blamed Terba for causing his own death and mused that the operation would never have succeeded without him. Noticing the Sith holocron had activated, Ezra took it out of the Imperial cadet helmet he was hiding it in and held it in his hand. The entity Presence told him that his anger gave him strength, and Ezra exclaimed that he wanted to become stronger and more powerful so that nobody could hurt his friends again.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\n====Heist at Reklam Station====\n=====Stealing starfighters=====\n[[File:Rebels_on_Reklam_Station.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra and his fellow rebels on Reklam Station.]]\nAfter returning to Chopper Base, Ezra was present for a briefing where Hondo shared his information about an Imperial [[salvage yard]] called [[Reklam Station]], which resided in the atmosphere of the planet [[Yarma]], and that thousands of decommissioned [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] [[BTL Y-wing starfighter|Y-wing starfighters]] were being dismantled there. After Rex suggested that the Y-wings would be good starfighters for the rebellion, Ezra advocated going ahead with a recovery mission. As a compromise, Hera suggested sending a recon part to scout the station. Because of Ezra's success in rescuing Hondo, Commander Sato promoted the young rebel to [[Lieutenant Commander]] and put him in charge of the [[Mission to Reklam Station|mission]]. With the meeting concluded, Hera assured Ezra that Kanan would be proud, to which Ezra told her it didn't seem that way considering his master's constant absence. Since his blinding, Kanan had become very detached, distancing himself from both his friends and the Force.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nLater, Ezra was in his bunk when Kanan entered. An argument quickly broke out between Padawan and Master when Kanan reprimanded his apprentice for dabbling with a Sith holocron, and proceeded to take the device. In a moment of anger, Ezra told his master that he did not need him or the Holocron.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nFor the mission to Reklam Station, Ezra, accompanied by Sabine, Zeb, Chopper, Rex, and Hondo, traveled to Yarma in the ''Phantom''. On the way, the rebels exited at [[Sereeda Waypoint]] where they were attacked by a Mining Guild patrol for failing to reduce their speed. When Ezra suggested destroying the entire patrol, Sabine disagreed and pointed out that the patrol would have already alerted the Empire. The rebels then continued their journey to Yarma. Once inside the planet's atmosphere, the rebels managed to find Reklam Station, but discovered there were few Y-wings that remained intact, a number that was reducing at an alarming rate. Seconds later, the rebels discovered that the ''Phantom'' was being pursued by two Imperial [[DTS-series Dismantler Droid]]s, which inflicted damage on the ship. Destroying the droids, Sabine manage to evade the station's scanners and park the ship under the floating scrapyard.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nAfter infiltrating Reklam Station, the rebels encountered several Ugnaught laborers. Ezra demanded they get out of their way, but Hondo managed to convince the workers to assist the rebels in stealing the Y-wings in exchange for their freedom. Having disabled the conveyor belts, Ezra ordered his team to get the Y-wings back to the rebellion. However, Sabine pointed out that the starfighters needed to be refueled first. The rebels had nearly finished refueling the fighters when they were spotted by a third dismantler droid. The station's Commander, Brom Titus, who Ezra had encountered earlier, reactivated the conveyor and engaged the [[magnetic lock]]s on the Y-wings; preventing the bombers from getting airborne. In response, Ezra and Rex headed to the command tower to override the locks.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nWhen the third dismantler droid attacked Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb, Rex went back to rescue them. Ezra continued alone and defeated a squad of stormtroopers in the station's [[hangar]] bay. In the middle of the fight, he was contacted by Hera, who inquired about the progress of the \"recon mission.\" Ezra claimed that things were going well but Hera quickly deduced he had disobeyed his orders. When Hondo arrived with the Ugnaughts, the pirate told Ezra that he would guard the Imperial landing craft there in case they needed a quick escape.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\n[[File:Ezra_wields_a_lightsaber_on_Reklam_Station.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra wielding his second lightsaber on Reklam Station.]]\nOnce inside the control tower, Ezra knocked down several stormtroopers with deflected blaster bolts before confronting Commander Titus. The two quickly recognized each other from their earlier encounter aboard the Imperial Interdictor. After a brief verbal exchange, Ezra demanded that Titus release the magnetic locks. When the commander revealed that he had sabotaged the control unit, Ezra decided to disable the station's power with his lightsaber despite the risks to everyone aboard. Ezra struck down the power unit with his lightsaber; freeing the starfighters but sending Reklam Station towards the surface of Yarma.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\n=====Escaping Reklam Station=====\nNoticing Hondo fleeing the salvage yard, Ezra contacted the pirate and jokingly asked him why he was leaving, realizing it was typical of the Weequay's behavior, to which Hondo replied he was making his quick escape, noting another successful adventure. Returning to the conveyor platform, Ezra commanded his rebel comrades to escape with the Y-wings while the young Jedi tried to reach the ''Phantom''. However, Reklam Station had began falling apart and the starship was knocked off by a falling crane. Unable to escape offworld or establish communications with the rest of his group, Ezra called on his master for help through the Force. Meanwhile, the rebel Y-wings were intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer commanded by Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]]. Fortunately for Ezra and the rebels, the Phoenix fleet arrived with the ''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser carrier ''[[Phoenix Nest]]'' and the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nWhile ''Phoenix Nest'' evacuated the stolen Y-wings, Hera and Kanan traveled on the ''Ghost'' into the depths of Yarma's atmosphere. With Hera flying alongside the plummeting structure, Kanan managed to pluck Ezra to safety after convincing him to have trust in him and let go of the station. Once aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra tried to tell Hera about the ''Phantom'' but the captain was preoccupied with getting the ship to safety. The rebel ships managed to escaped into hyperspace after [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] ordered Pryce to let them go. Back at Chopper Base, Hera reprimanded Ezra for disobeying his orders, endangering his team, and getting the ''Phantom'' destroyed. As punishment, his command was suspended.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nLater that night, Ezra apologized to Kanan for using the Sith holocron. When Ezra asked his master what he did with it, the older Jedi told him that it was safe. Ezra then thanked Kanan for saving him, to which his master told him that he would always come back, reconciling their relationship.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\n====The two holocrons====\n[[File:The_Holocrons_of_Fate_Episode_Guide.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra and Maul opening the holocrons]]\nWhile traveling aboard a CR90 corvette through hyperspace, Ezra and his master Kanan stumbled on a derelict Hammerhead corvette, that was part of the Phoenix cell. The two discussed their disagreement about the Sith holocron and the significance of their mission to Malachor. Once aboard, the two encountered a wounded crew member who informed them that a red blade was after him and that the ''Ghost'' was in danger. Ezra and his master contacted the ''Ghost'' only to learn that Maul had taken Hera, Chopper, Zeb, and Sabine captive. Maul then demanded that the two Jedi hand him the Sith holocron and Kanan Jarrus' holocron in return for the safety of their friends. The Jedi reluctantly acceded to his demands and made preparations to retrieve the Sith holocron, which was in the care of [[Bendu]]; a powerful Force-wielder who had befriended Kanan.<ref name=\"Holocrons\">{{Rebels|The Holocrons of Fate}}</ref>\n\nReturning to Atollon, Ezra and Kanan traveled on a [[Kanan's Joben T-85 speeder bike|speeder bike]] to the lair of Bendu, which lay in an outcrop of mesas. After hearing no responses, Ezra remarked that Kanan was hearing voices in his head. Suddenly, the two were surrounded by krykna spiders. While Kanan had made peace with the creatures, Ezra was still startled and ignited his lightsaber against his master's wishes. The krykna fled when Bendu finally stirred. When Bendu asked why they had come, Ezra explained their predicament with Maul and the Sith holocron. Bendu counselled the two Jedi that the [[Holocron fusion|convergence]] of the holocrons would be dangerous. From Bendu, Ezra learned that the holocrons were not merely libraries but that they also granted clarity. Bendu also warned that the convergence of holocrons could lead to chaos and that the Sith holocron was a source of imbalance between Ezra and his master.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nBendu reluctantly allowed Ezra to reclaim the holocron but set a task for the apprentice. In order to reclaim the holocron, Ezra had to travel inside a cave that was inhabited by krykna spiders. At Kanan's request, Ezra left his lightsaber behind and kept in touch with his master via [[comlink]]. Ezra kept in touch with his master but soon lost contact after being surrounded by several krykna. As they ventured deeper, Ezra took the opportunity to apologize for the recent troubles but Kanan assured his apprentice that it was not his fault. After Ezra forgave himself, apprentice and master reconciled. They eventually found the Sith holocron inside a deep chamber inhabited by krykna. At Kanan's urging, Ezra stayed calmed as he used the Force to levitate the object towards them. Their presence did not startle the krykna.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nUpon emerging, Bendu expressed his pleasure that the imbalance between Ezra and his master had been fix but warned them that their true test had just begun. Since Maul was unable to open the Jedi holocron, Bendu warned them that it would fall to one of them. When Ezra suggested that they could wield the power of both holocrons, Bendu warned them that secrets could not been unknown once they had been discovered. Together, Kanan and his master traveled on an [[RZ-1T trainer]] to rendezvous with Maul. When Maul asked Ezra to open the holocron, Ezra replied that he preferred to listen to his master. When Ezra asked Kanan what their plan was, Kanan replied that they would think by \"ear.\" Kanan also counselled his apprentice not to give in to fear and despair.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nTheir destination turned out to be the former Mandalorian asteroid colony, [[Vizsla Keep 09]]. Upon arriving, the two Jedi were greeted by Maul who asked Ezra if he found the Sith holocron illuminating. While Maul dealt with Kanan, Ezra was escorted by two repurposed [[RIC-1200|tour guide droids]] to the command center. Despite promising to spare his friends, Maul ordered his droids to kill the captives and made a second attempt on Kanan's life. When Maul returned, the two opened the holocrons and brought them together. While Ezra wanted to destroy the Sith, Maul only sought hope. The two were quickly bathed in a bright pink blaze of light. Ezra experienced a vision of [[Tatoo I|twin]] [[Tatoo II|suns]] while Maul realized that his old enemy Obi-Wan Kenobi still lived. Before they could proceed further, Kanan arrived with the other rebels and convinced Ezra to let go. Ezra closed his eyes and the vision ended.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\nEzra was knocked unconscious due to the power of the holocrons. Maul took the opportunity to flee on his starfighter [[Nightbrother (Gauntlet fighter)|''Nightbrother'']] but left the holocrons behind. After coming round, Ezra told Kanan that he had experienced strange visions of the future but was not sure whether they were things that Maul wanted him to see. Kanan assured Ezra that they would find out together.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" />\n\n====Waiting for Sabine====\n[[File:FulcrumContact-TAA.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra and his fellow rebels attending a briefing]]\nAfter Imperial forces [[Massacre near Teralov|destroyed]] a rebel convoy near [[Teralov]], Ezra and his fellow rebels attended a briefing chaired by Commander Sato to discuss the recent losses. During the meeting, Ezra asked how many pilots survived and remarked that at this rate there would no pilots flying for the rebellion. When Sato informed the rebels that a source called Fulcrum had information on Imperial cadets wanting to defect from the elite [[Skystrike Academy]], Ezra asked whether Ahsoka Tano was still alive. Hera then explained that Fulcrum was a codename for the rebellion's many undercover agents.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\">{{Rebels|The Antilles Extraction}}</ref>\n\nWhen Hera assigned Sabine an [[Escape from Skystrike Academy|undercover mission]] to infiltrate the Academy disguised as a cadet, Ezra asked why he was not involved in the mission. Sabine responded that she was once a real cadet while Hera added that Ezra was too well known to the Empire. Instead, he along with Kanan and Chopper were assigned to escort Sabine to the Academy and to evacuate her and the cadets when necessary.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\" />\n\nWhile waiting aboard a rebel CR90 corvette, Ezra and Kanan received word that Sabine had managed to infiltrate the Academy. Despite Kanan's efforts to reassure him that Sabine would be fine, Ezra still voiced his dislike for solo missions. After Sabine had managed to identify the defecting cadets [[Wedge Antilles]], [[Derek Klivian|Hobbie]], and [[Rake Gahree]], Sabine contacted Ezra to rendezvous with them in space. The four cadets flew towards the corvette but Governor Pryce deactivated their [[solar collector]]s; leaving them stranded in space. Ezra's corvette then came under heavy fire and was forced to retreat by Kanan.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\" />\n\nAfter Sabine along with Wedge and Hobbie escaped in a TIE bomber, Ezra's CR90 corvette flew into the planet's atmosphere and picked them up. They then managed to escape Captain [[Vult Skerris]]'s [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE interceptor]]. Once inside the command bridge, Sabine asked Ezra why he not left. Ezra responded that he stuck around just in case. Having completed their mission, the rebels fled into hyperspace. Back at Chopper Base, Ezra was present when Commander Sato formally welcomed Wedge and Hobbie into the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Antilles Extraction\" />\n\n====Return to Ryloth====\n[[File:Heras_Heroes_thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra disguised as a scout trooper on Ryloth]]\nLater, Ezra and his fellow rebels returned to Ryloth to deliver supplies to Hera's father Cham Syndulla, the leader of the Free Ryloth movement. The Spectres rescued Cham and Numa from being pursued by Imperial forces and evacuated them and their [[Blurrg]] steeds aboard the ''Ghost''. [[Unidentified scout trooper (Ryloth)|One]] of the pursuing [[scout trooper]]s followed them but Zeb knocked him out. Ezra then took possession of his [[Scout trooper armor/Canon|armor]]. Ezra and the other rebels then attended a briefing where Cham recounted the recent events on Ryloth; a new Imperial commander Grand Admiral Thrawn had occupied [[Tann Province]] and the [[Syndulla residence]].<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\">{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}</ref>\n\nEzra and the other rebels including Cham volunteered to help Hera recover her mother's [[Kalikori]], a priceless heirloom, from the Syndulla residence. For the mission, Ezra disguised himself as a scout trooper. Together with Hera, they infiltrated the Twi'lek settlement in a stolen 614-AvA speeder bike. Meanwhile, the other rebels staged a diversionary attack in the [[Tulara Ravine]]. Ezra managed to bluff his way past the Imperial sentries by posing as a scout trooper taking a captured rebel into Imperial custody. At the Syndulla residence, they rendezvoused with Chopper, who was disguised as an Imperial astromech droid.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nThe two rebels managed to find Cham's former office and recover the Kalikori. They tried to escape through the front door but found it blocked by stormtrooper sentries. The two rebels also had their first glimpse of Thrawn and his subordinate Captain [[Slavin]] with Ezra wondering who the [[Chiss|\"blue guy\"]] was. Hera and Ezra then tried to escape through the basement but found that the Imperials had set up a command center. With Chopper's help, the two rebels tried to get pass the stormtrooper sentries at the front door. While Ezra covered for her behind the wall separators and Chopper distracted the stormtroopers, Hera tried to sneak out through the front door.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nHowever, Hera was accosted by Slavin and Thrawn, with the latter wanting to question her. At Thrawn's orders, Ezra pretended to apprehend Hera and followed them to Thrawn's office. There, Thrawn examined the Kalikori and determined that Hera was Cham's daughter and a rebel operative. With Hera's cover blown, Ezra tried to shoot Thrawn. However, the Grand Admiral stunned him first. Ezra later awoke in a cell with Hera where Thrawn took the Kalikori into his possession and left Slavin to deal with the prisoners.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nSlavin then contacted Cham and offered to spare Hera and Ezra if he agreed to surrender by dawn. If he refused, Slavin threatened to execute the two prisoners. Cham accepted Slavin's offer. When Hera apologized for endangering her team, Ezra assured her that he would have done the same for her. Chopper then entered the cell to inform them of Cham's offer to surrender. Ezra then advocated escaping but Hera counseled against it because there were too many guards. Instead, she got Chopper to plant explosives all over the building to create a distraction; something that surprised Ezra.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\nAt dawn, Slavin took Ezra and Hera outside the Syndulla residence to facilitate the exchange. As expected, Cham arrived and disembarked from the ''Ghost''. At that point, Chopper emerged and activated the explosives under Hera's orders. This created an explosion which disoriented the Imperials and enabled all of the rebels to escape aboard the ''Ghost''. The rebels were allowed by Thrawn to escape as part of his \"experiment.\" Later, Ezra joined the other Spectres and Cham's rebels aboard the ''Ghost'' in Ryloth's wilderness. While listening to Hera affirm her love for her father, Kanan, and her crew, Ezra was hugged by Zeb.<ref name=\"Hera's Heroes\" />\n\n====Peacemaker on Agamar====\n[[File:Ray_shielded_rebels_stunned.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra and his fellow rebels are trapped by Separatist droids]]\nFollowing the events on Ryloth, Ezra accompanied Kanan, Zeb, Chopper, and Rex on a [[Mission to Agamar (2 BBY)|mission]] to salvage [[proton bomb]]s from a wrecked [[DH-Omni Support Vessel|Separatist supply ship]] on [[Agamar]]. From Rex, Ezra and the other rebels learned more about the Clone Wars. When Ezra picked up a [[B1-series battle droid]]'s head and opined that the droid did not look dangerous, Rex responded that those \"clankers\" killed many of his friends. Eventually, Ezra and his team found that the transport's munitions depot was still full of proton bombs. Ezra and his team soon found themselves trapped inside a [[ray shield]] and were captured by several battle droids led by [[B1-268]]. The battle droids stunned Ezra and his companions and took them captive.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\">{{Rebels|The Last Battle}}</ref>\n\nWhen Ezra and his companions awoke, they found themselves captives of the [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] [[Kalani]], who revealed that he had prevented the shut-down order that occurred after Order 66. Realizing that Rex was a Clone trooper, Kalani was determined to finish the Clone Wars as a victory for the [[Separatist Droid Army]]. Rex, Kanan, and Zeb refused to fight but Ezra saw an opportunity to obtain the proton bombs that the rebellion was after. In return for participating in the combat simulation, Ezra secured an agreement from Kalani to free Zeb, who had been designated as a hostage, and to give them the proton bombs if they won the match. Kalani accepted the deal and gave orders for his droids to assume position.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\nEzra, Kanan and Rex waited outside the hangar bay while Kalani briefed them that their objective was to reach the command bridge. Kalani dispatched a wave of battle droids. With Rex taking the lead, Ezra and Kanan utilized the Sword and Shield maneuver which involved deflecting blaster bolts and hurling grenades at the advancing droid columns. Working together, the rebels managed to scatter the first assault wave and reached the hangar. Once inside the hangar, the three rebels found themselves under attack by several [[droideka]]s. Unable to break through their [[deflector shield]]s, Ezra proposed collapsing a catwalk on them. Rex agreed and ordered Ezra to carry out the task while he and Kanan provided covering fire. On the way, Ezra encountered Chopper, who had managed to send a distress signal and find a [[Sheathipede-class transport shuttle|Neimoidian escort shuttle]]. Chopper wanted to leave but Ezra told him to get the shuttle ready while he fetched the others.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\nUsing his Force powers, Ezra managed to collapsed the catwalk on the droidekas. Despite his success in knocking out the droids, Ezra was reprimanded by Rex for taking too long and endangering the rest of the team. Kanan then reassured Ezra that Rex was still haunted by the Clone Wars. After knocking out another droideka, Ezra and the other rebels forced their way into the command bridge and declared victory. However, Kalani refused to accept victory on the grounds that the dilapidated state of his droid forces had prevented a fair fight. Before he could execute Zeb, Ezra managed to reason with Kalani and convince him that the clones and Separatists shared a common enemy in the form of the Galactic Empire; the successor to the Republic. Based on this logic, this made the rebels and Separatist droids allies. Ezra's arguments managed to sway Kalani after Imperial forces arrived and attacked a battle droid patrol led by B1-268.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\nWorking together, the rebels and Separatist droids decided to delay the advancing Imperial [[All Terrain Armored Transport (original)|AT-AT]] and AT-DP walkers. At Kalani's direction, the battle droids fired their bolts at Ezra and Kanan, who deflected them at several proton bombs. These proton bombs were then thrown into the path of an advancing AT-AT walker and damaged its front legs. The rebels and droids then fled on three Neimoidian shuttles that had been prepared by Chopper. While one of the shuttles was shot down, the rebels' and Kalani's shuttles manage to reach space. Aboard the shuttle, Rex praised Ezra for ending the Clone Wars; something that had eluded the [[Galactic Senate]], the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and the Droid Army. Kalani agreed with Rex's sentiments but believed that the rebels had a poor chance of success against the Empire and departed for parts unknown. Shortly later, the rebels were contacted by Hera. Rex informed Hera that the rebels had not found new proton bombs but had found a [[Phantom II|new transport]] for the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"The Last Battle\" />\n\n====Mission to Concord Dawn====\n[[File:Imperial_Supercommandos_thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Ezra Bridger, Chopper, and Sabine fleeing the Imperial Super Commandos]]\nAfter the Phoenix rebels lost contact with the Mandalorian Protectors on the third moon of Concord Dawn, Hera assigned Ezra and Chopper to escort Sabine and Fenn Rau, the leader of the Protectors, on a [[Second mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|recon probe]] of the moon. During the journey, the rebels traveled on the ''Phantom II''. Sabine assigned Ezra with the task of watching over Rau, who was handcuffed. When Ezra saw the fractured planet of Concord Dawn for the first time, he asked Rau what happened to the planet. Rau told him that the Mandalorians had fought for centuries.<ref name=\"ISC\">{{Rebels|Imperial Supercommandos}}</ref>\n\nWhile Ezra was distracted, Rau freed himself from his [[Magnetic binders]] and stunned Ezra and Sabine. Ezra was later woken up by Chopper, who slapped him out of unconsciousness. Chopper also freed Ezra and Sabine from their restraints. Upon exiting the shuttle, the rebels found Rau on top of a hill. Ezra used the Force to snatch Rau's pistol out of his hand. The rebels soon discovered that another Mandalorian faction had attacked the Protectors and slaughtered them. While Sabine and Rau argued, Chopper sensed that someone was coming.<ref name=\"ISC\" />\n\nThe rebels were then attacked by a [[Viper probe droid]]. Ezra tried to use the Force to grab it but Sabine managed to shoot down the droid. Rau wanted to bargain with the Empire, prompting an argument with Sabine. However, the visitors turned out to be a group of Mandalorian [[Imperial Super Commando]]s led by the Imperial [[Viceroy]] of Mandalore, [[Gar Saxon]]. Ezra and the others fled but he was quickly captured by Saxon and his men. Since Rau had taken his lightsaber, he was unable to fight back. The Imperials Super Commandos also captured Chopper and the ''Phantom II''.<ref name=\"ISC\" />\n\nWhen interrogated, Ezra tried to mislead his captors by claiming that he and Chopper were scavengers who worked for Hondo Ohnaka. However, Saxon did not believe Ezra and fired shots around Chopper to force his cooperation. Ezra then claimed that he was named Lando Calrissian. Unsatisfied, Saxon continued the interrogation and forced Ezra to reveal that Fenn Rau had sent him. When Ezra said that he did not know where Rau was, Saxon tried to shoot Chopper. Using his Force powers, Ezra managed to deflect the bolts twice. However, Saxon realized that he was a Jedi.<ref name=\"ISC\" />\n\nBefore Saxon could continue his interrogation, Sabine threw smoke grenades into the building. The three rebels then fled back to the ''Phantom II'' only to discover that Rau had stolen the ship. Ezra and his comrades were then surrounded by Saxon and his Super Commandos. Saxon attempted to force Sabine to yield to him but she used the Frequency 337 on her helmet to escape. Ezra and Sabine shared a [[jetpack]] with the youth clinging onto to Sabine for dear life. The three rebels fled into a canyon with the Super Commandos in pursuit.<ref name=\"ISC\" />\n\nThe Spectres decided to find Saxon's ship in order to get offworld. With a Super Commando closing in on them, Sabine was forced to fly low and Ezra narrowly avoided hitting a rock. Sabine then lowered Ezra on top of a rock and he then jumped onto the jet pack of another Mandalorian. Following a struggle, Ezra damaged the Commando's jet pack, causing him to fall to the ground. Using the Force, Ezra leapt towards Sabine and clung on to her. As they fled into a narrower part of the canyon, Sabine used grenades to block Saxon and his men. When Saxon and one of his men opened fire, Ezra lost his grip and was forced to ride on Chopper.<ref name=\"ISC\" />\n\nThe rebels eventually reached Saxon's ship but the Super Commandos closed in on them. Before they could kill the rebels, Rau arrived on the ''Phantom II'' and opened fire on Saxon's ship. Ezra and Chopper managed to escape aboard but Sabine struggled with Saxon, who was determined to kill her. Sabine managed to escape with Ezra's help. Once aboard, Rau expressed his new-found respect for Sabine's devotion to her friends and decided to join the rebellion. When Ezra opined that the Mandalorians were crazy, Rau joked that he was crazy enough to join the rebellion.<ref name=\"ISC\" />\n\n====Evacuation of Mykapo====\n[[File:Mykapo_DBfull.png|thumb|right|250px|The Spectres and Phoenix Squadron were sent to the planet Mykapo to evacuate rebel sympathizers.]]\nLater, Commander Sato dispatched the Spectres and Phoenix Squadron to the planet [[Mykapo]] to evacuate rebel sympathizers prior to an impending Imperial crackdown. Upon entering the system, Ezra and his fellow rebels came to the aid of a [[YT-2400 light freighter]] that was under attack from Imperial TIE fighters. Ezra opened fired on the TIEs with the ''Ghost''{{'s}} laser cannons. The freighter's captain identified his group as a local rebel cell called the [[Iron Squadron]] and destroyed an Imperial ''Gozanti''-class cruiser.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\">{{Rebels|Iron Squadron (episode)|Iron Squadron}}</ref>\n\nWhile Kanan and Zeb assisted with the evacuation efforts, Ezra along with Hera, Sabine, and Chopper docked with Iron Squadron's freighter ''[[Sato's Hammer]]''. Once aboard, they were greeted by the [[Theelin]] crew member [[Gooti Terez]] and her human comrade [[Jonner Jin]]. When Sabine remarked that the ship was in a state of disarray, Ezra cautioned her to be careful not to upset the crew. He and Gooti also broke up a fight between Chopper and Iron Squadron's [[astromech droid]] [[R3-A3]]. Ezra along with Hera and Sabine tried unsuccessfully to convince the freighter's captain [[Mart Mattin]] to leave the system because the Empire was returning with reinforcements.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nUnable to reason with Iron Squadron, the Spectres returned to the ''Ghost''. By then, Phoenix Squadron had completed the evacuation of rebel sympathizers on Mykapo. Before they could leave to rendezvous with the rebel fleet, Ezra convinced Hera to give him, Sabine, and Chopper another try at reasoning with Iron Squadron. Hera reluctantly complied but warned to leave on ''Phantom II'' if Imperial reinforcements arrived. Sabine and Chopper managed to gain the Squadron's trust by helping R3-A3 to repair the ship's hyperdrive.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nDespite repairing the hyperdrive, Sabine and Chopper's efforts came to naught when Mart redirected the ship's power to its laser cannons and deflector shields. Ezra and Sabine managed to convince Gooti and Jonner after Admiral Konstantine arrived with a light cruiser, two ''Gozanti'' cruisers and several TIE fighters. The Spectres, Gooti, Jonner, and R3-A3 managed to flee aboard the ''Phantom II'' but Mart wanted to stay behind and fight. However, the ''Sato's Hammer'' was damaged and stranded in space. Ezra and the other rebels were forced to flee into hyperspace. Before leaving, Ezra vowed to return for his friend.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\nAfter returning to the fleet, Ezra attended a briefing with the other Spectres, Iron Squadron, and the holographic forms of Rex and Commander Sato. After receiving a distress call from Mart, Ezra and the other rebels joined forces to rescue Mart. They managed to remove a [[magno-mine]] that Admiral Konstantine had attached to the ''Sato's Hammer''. During the [[Skirmish over Mykapo|skirmish]], the rebels managed to damage Konstantine's cruiser. Commander Sato arrived with reinforcements and also destroyed Konstantine's TIE fighters and ''Gozanti'' cruisers. The rebels then escaped into hyperspace shortly after Grand Admiral Thrawn arrived on the ''[[Chimaera]]''. Ezra was present with the other Spectres at Chopper Base when Mart embraced his uncle Sato and his crew.<ref name=\"Iron Squadron\" />\n\n====Mission to Wynkahthu====\n[[File:Wynkahthu_cargo_extraction.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra Bridger and Hondo Ohnaka recovered the cargo of a Class four container transport.]]\nLater, Ezra was contacted by his pirate friend Hondo Ohnaka, who solicited the Spectres' assistance in recovering cargo from a stranded Imperial cargo ship in the upper atmosphere of the stormy planet of [[Wynkahthu]]. Ezra's rebel comrades particularly Hera and Sabine distrusted Hondo and his new business partner Azmorigan but Ezra reasoned that the pirate could be trusted since they had come out safely during their last mission to Reklam Station. The Spectres agreed to assist Hondo and Azmorigan recover their treasure in return for getting access to a shipment of proton bombs aboard the cargo ship.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\">{{Rebels|The Wynkahthu Job}}</ref>\n\nSince the Imperial cargo ship was stuck over a vortex, the rebels had to devise a plan to extract the cargo. Unhappy with Ezra's fraternization with Hondo, Hera assigned Zeb leadership of the recovery team. When Ezra protested, Hera countered that Hondo was untrustworthy; a stance shared by his master Kanan. Ezra resented this perceived demotion and made snide remarks towards Zeb. Zeb's plan involved the rebels, Hondo, and Azmorigan leaping from the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cargo bay into the upper hull of the cargo ship.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nEzra and his fellow expeditionary members then accessed the ship through a hatch. Once inside, Zeb sent Chopper to restore power to the ship. Ezra openly questioned Zeb's decision in the presence of the other team members. Shortly later, the rebels encountered one of Hondo's Ugnaught crew members [[Melch]], who had survived a failed earlier attempt to board the cargo ship. While Hondo's omission of these facts solidified Zeb's distrust of the pirate, Ezra insisted that they could still work with him.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nWhen the rebels reached the cargo bay, tensions between Ezra and Zeb resurfaced when the former insisted on using his lightsaber to breach the chamber against the latter's protests. After finding the treasure and bombs, the rebels opened the cargo bay's outer door. This allowed the ''Ghost'' to approach the bay. Since the ship could not land, grappling guns were used to fire magnetic cables onto the ship's hull. Under Zeb's orders, the recovery team began loading the proton bombs aboard the ''Ghost'' first. Ezra sided with Hondo when the pirate insisted on loading his treasure but Zeb was unwilling to back down.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nWhen Ezra noticed that Azmorigan had disappeared, Hondo was unconcerned since he wanted to keep a greater share of the treasure. As a result, Ezra realized that Hondo only care for himself. When Zeb went to look for him, Ezra insisted that he be the one to find Azmorigan but Zeb ordered Ezra to stay behind and load the cargo. After Ezra had loaded the fourth batch of proton bombs, a lightning bolt caused the cargo ship to list towards the vortex. Hera ordered Ezra and his team to evacuate but Ezra insisted on finding Azmorigan and Zeb, who had not returned. Ezra was soon contacted via comlink by Zeb, who revealed that he and Azmorigan had been locked in the ship's brig by a reactivated [[DT-series sentry droid]].<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nEzra rushed to find the brig and encountered Chopper. Together, the two managed to free Zeb and Azmorigan. Before they could return to the cargo bay, they ran into the sentry droid. Despite Zeb's orders to stay hidden, Azmorigan destroyed the sentry droid. However, this activated the four other sentry droids which pursued the recovery team back to the cargo bay. While Ezra and Zeb exchanged fire with the sentry droids, Hondo and Azmorigan took the opportunity to flee back to the ''Ghost'' on their treasure chests. Chopper quickly followed suit.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nUnable to hold out anymore, the two rebels fled back to the ''Ghost'' on the magnetic cable system. However, the droids destroyed the grappling gun, causing Ezra and Zeb to fall. However, the two rebels managed to hold on to their rope and were pulled aboard the ''Ghost'' by Kanan. The rebels and their confederates then fled the cargo ship before the vortex ripped it apart. Once safely aboard the ''Ghost'', the rebels examined their cargo and discovered that Melch had stowed aboard Hondo's treasure chest. Having accomplished their objectives, the Spectres and Hondo's party parted company.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\n====Undercover on Lothal====\n=====Reuniting with old friends=====\n[[File:Lothal_resistance_meets_Ezra.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Morad Sumar, Jho, and Marida Sumar reunite with Ezra Bridger]]\nAfter the Phoenix Squadron received intelligence that the Empire was developing a new weapon at the [[Imperial Armory Complex]], Ezra along with Kanan and Chopper traveled back to his homeworld of Lothal to enlist the support of Ryder Azadi's [[Lothal resistance group|cell]] in taking out the factory. They managed to rendezvous with Ryder's landspeeder in the streets of Capital City but were attacked by an Imperial patrol. During the brief skirmish, Ezra and Kanan managed to use their lightsabers to topple an AT-DP walker. They then escaped two 614-AvA speeder bikes, which exploded due to faulty engines.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\">{{Rebels|An Inside Man}}</ref>\n\nEzra and his team then traveled to a [[stone circle]] in Lothal's wilderness that served as Ryder's encampment. There, Ezra was reunited with several old friends including the farmer Morad Sumar, his wife [[Marida Sumar]], and the Ithorian bartender [[Jho]]. Morad noted that Ezra had grown and complimented the young rebel for making his parents proud. Ezra and Kanan learnt that Ryder's cell was sabotaging vehicles produced by the Lothal Imperial factory. After discussing their mission with Ryder and Morad, the rebels learned that the Empire had a secret project housed inside the factory's Section A2. With the help of Morad, Ezra and his team managed to infiltrate the factory disguised as workers and Chopper disguised as an [[R4 courier droid|Imperial courier droid]].<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nBefore they could proceed on their mission, Ezra and the other workers were summoned for an assembly by Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn had been dispatched by [[Imperial High Command]] to investigate the high rate of defective vehicles produced by the Lothal Imperial factory. As a deterrent, Thrawn killed Morad by forcing him to ride a defective speeder bike, which exploded. When Thrawn ordered his subordinates to question the workers, Ezra and Kanan managed to slip away with the help of Chopper, who detonated another speeder bike.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nEzra and Kanan then encountered a scout trooper and a stormtrooper, whom they knocked out and stole their uniforms. With Chopper, they headed to Section A2 only to discover that Thrawn had stationed sentries there. Chopper managed to gain admission by electrocuting a courier droid and stealing its clearance code. While awaiting Chopper's return, Ezra and Kanan were confronted by a stormtrooper corporal and his men, who noted they were outside their allocated area. Ezra and Kanan fled the stormtroopers when Chopper return and headed into a turbolift.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n=====From foe to friend=====\n[[File:Kanan_and_Ezra_meet_Kallus.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Agent Kallus reveals to Ezra and Kanan that he was a Fulcrum agent]]\nInside the turbolift, the rebels encountered their perennial adversary Agent Kallus, who quickly recognized them. Ezra and Kanan attacked Kallus but the ISB agent managed to convince them that he was a Fulcrum operative by quoting the code-phrase \"by the light of Lothal's moons.\" While Ezra and Kanan were suspicious of Kallus, the ISB agent managed to convince the rebels of his sincerity by recounting how he had aided Zeb and Sabine in their earlier encounters. Satisfied, Kanan enlisted Kallus' help in breaching a communications station so that they could contact Ryder.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nEzra and Kanan stormed the com station with their lightsabers and blasters and managed to stun the station crew. After Kallus used the station port to transmit Kanan's signal to Ryder, the rebels learned that Ryder was launching a diversionary attack on the east gate. Kallus then told the rebels that they could escape through the hangar bay at the east gate. To convince Kallus' Imperial superiors that he had fought against the rebels, Ezra used the Force to fling him against a glass monitor screen. When Kanan chided Ezra for beating him to the game, Ezra reassured him that he would get another chance now that Kallus was working for them.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nFollowing Kallus' instructions, Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper commandeered an AT-DP walker and exited the east gate. However, the rebels' walker encountered two AT-AT walkers, that had been sent to counter Ryder's attack. Piloting the walker, Ezra claimed that he was a reinforcement that had been sent to aid the AT-ATs. However, Thrawn warned the pilots that Ezra's team had hijacked the AT-DP walker. Ezra's walker was attacked by the two AT-ATs, which proceeded to open fire on it. Ezra managed to maneuver his walker under one of the AT-ATs. However, the AT-AT proceeded to crush the smaller AT-DP walker.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\nEzra and Kanan managed to use their lightsabers to cut their way out of their doomed transport. Together with Chopper, they boarded the walker, took out the pilots, and escaped through the hatch. At that point, Marida fired a rocket at their hijacked AT-AT, which toppled to the ground. Ezra's team then escaped into the wilderness on Ryder's two landspeeders. During the journey, Ezra informed Marida that her husband had died during the mission. Ezra, Kanan, and Ryder then attended a hologram debriefing with Hera, Sabine, and Zeb. After decrypting the stolen Imperial plans, the rebels learned that Thrawn had developed a [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|new starfighter initiative]] that threatened the rebellion.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n====The Specter of Maul====\n[[File:Skirmish_at_Nightsister_Lair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Maul and Ezra fight the Nightsisters\u2013possessed bodies of Kanan and Sabine]]\nUsing the information recovered by Ezra's team, Hera made plans to launch a strike on the Lothal Imperial factory. Ezra was assigned to carry out reconnaissance work on Imperial military movements there and was also made leader of the team. Before they could proceed with the mission, Ezra began seeing visions of Maul in the Chopper Base command center. After seeing a visage of Maul behind him, Ezra fainted and was tended to by Kanan and Zeb. When he awoke in his private quarters, Ezra insisted that he was fine and insisted on proceeding with the mission despite Hera and Kanan's misgivings.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\">{{Rebels|Visions and Voices}}</ref>\n\nWhile helping Sabine load supplies aboard the ''Ghost'', Ezra witnessed Maul and attacked a rebel soldier, whom he mistook for Maul. Kanan was forced to restrain him. When Ezra realized his actions, he was scared and confused. While Hera and the rest of the team departed for Lothal, Ezra, Kanan, and Sabine stayed behind. After Kanan got Sabine to track Ezra's [[wrist comm]], Kanan and Ezra traveled into the wilderness to meet with Bendu. After Ezra related the details of his last encounter with Maul, Bendu surmised that the experience with the holocrons had a negative effect on Ezra.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nDespite Bendu's warning not to turn around, Kanan and Ezra turned to discover that Maul was watching them on a sand dune. When Ezra asked Maul how he had found them, Maul replied that Ezra's abrupt severance of the holocron connection had caused both to see fragments of each other's visions. Maul revealed that he had come to Atollon to retrieve the remaining message of his vision from Ezra's mind. When Kanan objected, Maul threatened to trigger a [[homing beacon]] that would alert the Empire to their presence. With little choice, Ezra complied and departed with Maul on his starship ''Nightbrother'' for [[Dathomir]].<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nAfter landing, Maul led Ezra through the site of the [[Battle of Dathomir|battle]] where his [[Nightsisters]] kin had been slaughtered by the Separatists. Maul led a reluctant Ezra into a cave within the [[Nightsister lair]]. There, Ezra discovered that Maul had been preparing for a ritual and had amassed a great deal of objects from his past including the [[Darksaber]]. When Ezra almost touched the Darksaber, Maul chastised the youth and told him that his Mandalorian friend could provide him with more information on the Darksaber's significance.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nAs part of the ritual, Ezra and Maul had to drink glasses of [[magick]] water. Ezra insisted on Maul going ahead and the potion caused their eyes to turn green and shoot beams of light. As a result, Ezra learnt that Obi-Wan Kenobi held the key to destroying the Sith while Maul learned that Kenobi was located on a [[Tatooine|planet]] with twin suns. After the ritual ended, the two were accosted by several fallen Nightsister spirits who demanded that they pay their price in flesh and blood. Before Ezra and Maul could escape, Kanan and Sabine entered the cave.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nDespite Ezra's warnings, Kanan and Sabine [[Skirmish on Dathomir|attacked]] the apparitions with their blasters and were possessed by the fallen spirits. Ezra tried to talk to Kanan and Sabine but his possessed friends attacked him and Maul. The two managed to escape by fleeing through the cave entrance, which the spirits could not cross since the altar was their source of power. Maul then attempted to recruit Ezra as his apprentice by claiming that their destiny was linked to the planet with the twin suns. However, Ezra refused to abandon his friends. Maul then rejected Ezra as a \"disappointment\" and left on his ship.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nReturning to the cave, Ezra decided to lure out Kanan and Sabine in order to exorcise the spirits. He was soon attacked by the possessed Sabine, who told him that the spirits desired his body. Using the Force, Ezra managed to throw Sabine out of the cave and the spirit was exorcised from her. After telling Sabine not to enter the cave again, Ezra went to find Kanan. He found a possessed Kanan sitting above the altar. Ezra managed to convince the spirits to leave Kanan if he sacrificed his flesh and blood. In return, the spirits demanded that Ezra fight Kanan to prove his worth.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\nFollowing a fight, Ezra managed to beat Kanan and the Nightsister spirit left his body. After telling Kanan to leave, Ezra used his lightsaber and the Darksaber to destroy the altar, vanishing the spirits. Once the spirits had departed, Ezra briefed Kanan and Sabine about his encounter with Maul. Ezra was annoyed that Sabine had re-entered the cave but she replied that she had never listened to him before. Ezra then told Kanan and Sabine that Maul had discovered that Master Kenobi was still alive and that he was inhabiting a planet with twin suns. The three resolved to stop Maul from killing Kenobi who held the key to destroying the Sith.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" />\n\n====Mission on Geonosis====\n[[File:UncannyPtosis-SWRS03E13.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra learned that not all of their allies shared the same values as him.]]\nAt the request of Senator Bail Organa and [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]], Ezra, his fellow Spectres and Rex undertook a [[Mission to investigate Geonosis|mission]] to find the rebel leader [[Saw Gerrera]], who had disappeared while investigating the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species. After landing on Geonosis, Ezra accompanied Rex, Kanan, and Chopper as they searched a Geonosian structure where Saw had last transmitted a signal to rebel command. There, Ezra discovered a hole which led to an underground labyrinth.<ref name=\"Ghosts\">{{Rebels|Ghosts of Geonosis}}</ref>\n\nWhile underground, Ezra and his comrades discovered sealed tunnels and the helmets of Saw's [[Partisans]]. His master Kanan and Chopper wanted to leave but Ezra and Rex convinced them to continue their mission to find Saw. Ezra and his comrades eventually reached a dead-end only to be cornered by several B1 battle droids and a droideka. Saw soon arrived and outflanked the battle droids. This allowed Ezra and Kanan to destroy the droideka with their lightsabers.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nEzra and his comrades learned that Saw and his team had been attacked by a lone Geonosian warrior. The Geonosian had killed his comrades and Saw wanted to investigate whether the Geonosian knew why the Empire had exterminated the planet's population. The Spectres and Rex agreed to help Saw complete his mission. While contacting Hera at a large air shaft, the rebels found the Geonosian hiding on the other side. With the help of his master Kanan's Force powers, Ezra managed to Force jump onto the other side.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nHe was soon followed by Chopper. Ezra and Chopper pursued the Geonosian through the labyrinth but were unable to keep up with him. Saw, Kanan, and Rex finally managed to corner the Geonosian and disable the remote controller he was using to control the droidekas on the surface. When Saw harshly questioned the Geonosian about what the Empire was doing on Geonosis, Ezra objected to his aggressive methods and befriended the Geonosian, whom he nicknamed [[Klik-Klak]]. After Chopper picked up an energy reading, Saw forced Klik-Klak to accompany them.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nWhen Saw dropped a compass-shaped device which contained a hologram of his late sister [[Steela Gerrera]], Ezra returned it to Saw; who told the boy that this was all that he had of his late sister. Rex then explained that Saw was still grieving over the loss of his sister Steela and distrusted Geonosians due to their alliance with the Separatists during the Clone Wars. The rebels soon discovered that the source of the energy reading was [[Klik-Klak's nest]], which hosted a transmitter and a workshop. Ezra protested when Saw began rummaging through Klik-Klak's home. Trusting Ezra, Klik-Klak revealed that he was the custodian of the last [[Karina|Geonosian queen egg]].<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nEzra objected to Saw's plan to take Klik-Klak offworld for interrogation and insisted that the Geonosian belonged to his homeworld. Kanan managed to broker a truce whereby they would take Klik-Klak to Chopper Base for interrogation but return him to Geonosis once they had finished. The rebels then rendezvoused with Hera and the ''Ghost'' at the central air shaft. Once aboard, an argument broke out between the Spectres, Rex, and Saw. Ezra objected to Saw's plan to take Klik-Klak offworld on the ''Phantom II'' and his electrocution of the Geonosian with an electro-shock device. Ezra and Rex were also involved in a physical altercation with Saw. When Saw threatened to shoot the Geonosian queen egg, Ezra countered that doing so would help the Empire to exterminate the Geonosian species.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nThe two asides put aside their differences to repel an Imperial boarding party of [[Jumptrooper]]s from Captain [[Brunson]]'s [[Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]]. During the fight, Ezra used the Force to hurl detonators at the jumptroopers. After repelling the boarding party, the rebels descended into the depths of Geonosis. While underground, the rebels and Saw discovered evidence in the form of poison canisters that the Empire had perpetrated [[Sterilization of Geonosis|genocide]] against the Geonosian species. Confronted with the evidence, Saw underwent a change of heart and freed Klik-Klak and the Geonosian queen egg; who disappeared farther underground.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nThe rebels then managed to escape Brunson's light cruiser by badly damaging the ship with proton bombs. In the process, they lost several of the poison canisters they had carried away as evidence. During the briefing, Ezra reassured his fellow rebels, Senator Organa, and Commander Sato that they had given the Geonosian species another chance to survive. After Saw left the room, Kanan told Ezra that not all of their allies shared the same values and motives for fighting against the Empire.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\n====Training exercise====\n[[File:Hobbie_Wedge_Warhead.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ezra, Wedge, Hobbie and other members of the Phoenix Squadron went to a training exercise.]]\nLater, Ezra accompanied Hera, Kanan, Sabine, Wedge, Hobbie and other members of the Phoenix Squadron on a training exercise. Their friend Zeb was despondent because he could not come along and had to stay behind with Chopper and AP-5. Ezra and Sabine told Zeb to cheer up before leaving aboard the ''Ghost''. The following day, Ezra and the other Spectres returned after Zeb contacted them to report an [[EXD-9's infiltration of Chopper Base|incident]] the previous night. Ezra and his comrades were present when the rebel source Fulcrum praised the rebels for reprogramming the [[E-XD-series infiltrator droid]] [[EXD-9]] into an improvised bomb. Ezra and the other Spectres listened as AP-5 began to recount the incident before Zeb playfully muzzled him.<ref name=\"Warhead\">{{Rebels|Warhead (episode)|Warhead}}</ref>\n\n====Sabine's trials====\n[[File:SabineEzraTraining.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra helped Sabine in her training.]]\nEzra was present with the other Spectres when Kanan, Fenn Rau, and Hera convened a meeting aboard the ''Ghost'' to discuss the matter of training Sabine how to wield the Darksaber, an ancient Mandalorian symbol of power that was. Kanan, Fenn, and Hera wanted Sabine to use the Darksaber to rally her people to the rebel cause. Due to her estranged relationship with [[Clan Wren|her family]], Sabine was reluctant to assume this responsibility. When Kanan suggested that it was no coincidence that Sabine found the Darksaber, Ezra voiced his opinion that Sabine might not be able to master the weapon given the difficulty he had learning how to master the Force and the lightsaber. After some discussion, Sabine reluctantly decided to learn how to wield the Darksaber.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\">{{Rebels|Trials of the Darksaber}}</ref>\n\nLater, Ezra accompanied Kanan and Sabine on a landspeeder into Atollon's wilderness. During the journey, Ezra explained that going into the wilderness would allow them to avoid the distractions at Chopper Base. Sabine then responded that she would damage him if he did not shut up. After setting up camp, Ezra watched as Kanan and Sabine parried with sticks. Judging Sabine's skills to be wanting, Kanan instructed Sabine to practice with Ezra. For the next two days, Ezra taught Sabine the basics of stick fighting. Kanan did not want Sabine to train with the Darksaber yet because he feared that she would hurt herself.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nFenn later arrived at the camp with supplies and outfitted Sabine with a [[Mandalorian vambrace]]. Sabine used the vambrace to gain an advantage over Ezra during a training session. However, Kanan intervened and managed to outsmart Sabine. He took the opportunity to lecture her that discipline and training not tricks would keep her alive in the long run. Frustrated with Kanan's training methods, Sabine stormed off in rage to spend some time alone at a cave.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nTaking pity on Sabine, Ezra encouraged her to persevere with her training. He told Sabine that while Kanan was not the easiest teacher, he still meant well. When Sabine responded that she did not want the baggage that came with the Darksaber, Ezra asked her about her family. Sabine explained that her family regarded her as a traitor. When Ezra said that wasn't true, Sabine told him that he did not know her and opined that she would be unable to lead her people if she did not resolve her family problems. Ezra reminded Sabine that at least she had a family to go back to, unlike him. Sabine realized that Ezra was right and went to clear her thoughts in the wilderness.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nLater that night, Ezra chatted with Fenn by a campfire. When Ezra asked Rau when Sabine would returned, he cautioned patience. When Ezra opined that Sabine needed more time, Rau responded that time was not a luxury the galaxy could afford. At that point, Sabine returned to the camp. Kanan apologized for holding her training back while Sabine apologized for her attitude. Ezra and Fenn watched as Sabine parried with the Darksaber against Kanan in a training exercise.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\nThe exercise proved to be an opportunity for Sabine to come to terms with her decision to leave her family. Ezra and the others learned that Sabine had spoken out against the Empire for using weapons to enslave Mandalore. As a result, her parents had cast her away. As the duel got more intense, Ezra wanted to intervene but Fenn held him back. After besting Kanan in the duel, Sabine broke down and wept. Following the sparring session, Ezra joined Kanan and Rau in pledging to help Sabine to fulfill her goals of repairing her relationship with her family and reuniting the Mandalorians.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" />\n\n====Mission to Krownest====\n[[File:YouAreSoGrounded-SWRS03E16.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ezra believed that Sabine could repair her relationship with her family.]]\nAfter Sabine had completed her training, Ezra along with Kanan, Fenn Rau, and Chopper accompanied Sabine on a mission to the planet [[Krownest]], the home of Clan Wren. While Ezra was optimistic that Sabine's family would welcome her, Sabine disagreed because she knew that her mother [[Count]]ess [[Ursa Wren]] still resented her for abandoning the Empire. Despite Sabine sending a transmission to her family, their ship ''Phantom II'' was still attacked by a squad of Mandalorian warriors led by Sabine's brother [[Tristan Wren]].<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\">{{Rebels|Legacy of Mandalore}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Phantom II'' sustained damage to its main thrusters but Sabine managed to land the ship in the snow. While Fenn and Chopper stayed inside the ship, Ezra along with Sabine and Kanan confronted the Clan Wren warriors. Ezra's decision to ignite his green lightsaber sparked a gun battle with the Mandalorian warriors. The skirmish ended when the warriors' leader Tristan recognized Sabine's voice and ordered his men to ceasefire. Ezra and his comrades then accompanied the Mandalorians to the [[Wren Stronghold]] nearby.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\nAt the stronghold, Ezra and his fellow rebels received a cold reception from Ursa, who was displeased to see her daughter in the company of rebels. Still, Ursa reluctantly granted them an audience in her throne room but ordered the visitors to surrender their weapons including Sabine's Darksaber. Ezra and Kanan listened as Sabine had a tense discussion with her mother about the Empire, Fenn Rau's Protectors, and Gar Saxon. While Sabine and Ursa withdrew for a private conversation, Ezra and Kanan remained behind in the throne room under guard.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\nEzra tried to make conversation with Tristan but Kanan insisted on letting him deal with the negotiations. Kanan then sought an audience with Countess Ursa, who agreed to meet the Jedi. Unknown to both Jedi, Ursa had alerted Viceroy Gar Saxon to their presence and had agreed to trade the Jedi and the Darksaber in return for clemency towards her daughter. During the meeting, Ursa accused the Jedi of not understanding her daughter. Ezra responded by asking Ursa why Clan Wren was siding with the Empire. When Ursa chastised him for his perceived naivety, Ezra revealed that Sabine had fought Saxon on Concord Dawn. Ursa then apologized to the Jedi for what she would have to do next would be unfortunate.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\nShortly later, Saxon and his Super Commandos entered the Wren stronghold and apprehended Ezra and Kanan. Saxon also took possession of the Darksaber. Saxon then reneged on his earlier agreement with Ursa and ordered his men to destroy Clan Wren. At that point, Fenn Rau entered the throne room and handed Ezra and Kanan back their weapons. The Jedi then helped the Wrens and Fenn Rau to [[Skirmish on Krownest|defeat]] Saxon's Super Commandos. Saxon then fought with Sabine and Ezra lent her his green lightsaber.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\nEzra and the others watched Sabine fighting Saxon outside from the stronghold's balcony. When Ezra tried to intervene, Ursa warned him that Mandalorian custom and law dictated that nobody could interfere in a duel. Following a fierce duel, Sabine managed to recover the Darksaber and defeat Saxon. However, she decided to spare the Viceroy's life. When Saxon tried to kill her, Ursa executed the Viceroy. Following the skirmish, Sabine and Fenn decided to stay behind to help her family reunify the Mandalorians while Ezra and Kanan departed with Chopper aboard the ''Phantom II''. Before leaving, Sabine thanked Ezra and Kanan for helping her return to her family.<ref name=\"Legacy of Mandalore\" />\n\n====Rescuing Agent Kallus====\n[[File:Ezra_captured_TIE.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra Bridger allowed himself to be captured in order to rescue Kallus.]]\nLater, the rebellion obtained intelligence that Grand Admiral Thrawn was monitoring Agent Kallus' Fulcrum transmissions. Ezra along with the droids Chopper and AP-5 took part in a [[Rescue of Alexsandr Kallus|mission]] to extricate Kallus before Thrawn exposed his identity. For the mission, Ezra and the droids stole a star Commuter 2000 [[shuttle]] from Lothal's Capital City spaceport and allowed themselves to be captured by Lieutenant Lyste's Imperial light cruiser, where Agent Kallus was stationed. For the second phase, Kanan and Rex, who were disguised as stormtroopers, would pick up the rebels and Kallus in the stolen Imperial [[Shuttle TY992]].<ref name=\"TIE\">{{Rebels|Through Imperial Eyes}}</ref>\n\nAt first, the mission proceeded according to plan. Ezra was arrested and locked in the light cruiser's brig. There, he informed Kallus of the rebel plan to rescue him. However, the mission was complicated when Grand Admiral Thrawn requested a meeting with Lieutenant Lyste and Agent Kallus aboard the Star Destroyer ''Chimaera''. Seeking to atone for the debacle involving Princess Leia Organa, Lyste brought Ezra, whom Kallus claimed was a rogue bounty hunter, aboard the ''Chimaera''.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nOnce aboard, Ezra was locked in [[Detention Block B7]]. Chopper and AP-5 managed to inform Rex and Kanan about the change in plans but were unable to obtain a new set of clearance codes. After attending to Thrawn and sending Lyste on a faux diversionary mission, Kallus freed Ezra from his cell. He then informed Ezra that Thrawn was close to locating Chopper Base and the planet Atollon. When Kallus requested the location of Atollon so he could delete the planet from Thrawn's star chart, Ezra was reluctant to expose the rebel base's location. However, AP-5 managed to convince Ezra to work with Kallus because they could only obtain a new set of clearance codes from Thawn's Office.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nIn an attempt to mislead Thrawn, Kallus decided to frame Lyste as Fulcrum. He used Lyste's stolen code cylinder to enter the prison block and obtained Ezra a set of Imperial uniforms. Since Ezra superficially resembled Lyste, Kallus decided to use him to fool the Imperials into thinking he was Lyste. Working with Kallus, Ezra used a Jedi mind trick to convince one of Thrawn's sentries that he was Lieutenant Lyste and that he wanted to meet with Thrawn. Inside the office, Ezra was tempted to recover Hera's Kalikori but was rebuked by Agent Kallus, who reminded him they were not there to steal art. After Kallus had deleted Atollon from Thrawn's database and Chopper had transmitted a new set of codes to the Kanan and Rex, the rebels and Kallus prepared to leave.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nHowever, Thrawn returned to his office and the rebels were forced to hide. Ezra and AP-5 managed to hide behind Thrawn's artifacts and furniture. Kallus then reprogrammed the Grand Admiral's Imperial sentry droids into assassins. While Thrawn struggled with the droids, Ezra and Chopper fled. Thrawn caught a glimpse of Ezra and mistook him for Lyste. Ezra and his comrades managed to reach the hangar just as Rex and Kanan were fighting off Governor Pryce. The rebels received unexpected help from Lieutenant Lyste, who stunned Pryce under the assumption that she was Fulcrum.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\nLieutenant Lyste then caught a glimpse of the impostor Ezra and the droids fleeing aboard Shuttle TY992 with Kanan and Rex before being knocked unconscious by Kallus. Kallus then changed his mind and decided to stay behind to continue leaking information to the rebels. After Ezra and his comrades had left, Kallus framed Lyste as Fulcrum. While Governor Pryce and others believed Kanan's account, Thrawn and the ISB [[Colonel]] [[Wullf Yularen]] soon realized that Kallus was the real Fulcrum. Their suspicions were confirmed when Thrawn examined Ezra's bounty hunter helmet and deduced that Kallus had concealed Ezra's identity because he was colluding with the rebels. However, they allowed Kallus to continue operating so that he could lead them to Chopper Base.<ref name=\"TIE\" />\n\n====Ferrying Mon Mothma====\n[[File:Secret_Cargo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ezra helped Mon Mothma getting to Dantooine.]]\nAt the request of Senator Bail Organa, Ezra and his fellow rebels waited in deep space aboard the ''Ghost'' to rendezvous with another rebel group. This rebel group turned out to be the rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]] and [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]]. While bidding their time, Ezra and his rebel comrades listened to a [[propaganda]] HoloNet broadcast by [[Alton Kastle]] and learned that Mothma was wanted by the Empire for denouncing the [[Ghorman Massacre]]. Shortly later, the ''Ghost'' was discovered by a [[X3-13|tactical infiltration pod]] piloted by an E-XD infiltrator droid; which Zeb and Chopper had encountered earlier.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nEzra managed to destroy the Imperial probe with the ''Ghost''{{'s}} frontal cannons but was unable to stop the droid from contacting the Empire. Shortly later, Mothma's shuttle ''[[Chandrila Mistress]]'' exited hyperspace with Gold Squadron. After meeting with Mothma's senatorial attache [[Erskin Semaj]] and [[Gold Leader]] Captain [[Jon Vander]], the Spectres began refueling Gold Squadron's Y-wings. While refueling, Ezra and Zeb argued with the pilot [[Gold Two (rebellion)|Gold Two]] and Vander over the ''Spectres''{{'s}} reckless tactics and Gold Squadron's high level of secrecy.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nThe argument was interrupted by the arrival of an Imperial light cruiser and ''Gozanti''-class cruiser, which dispatched several TIE fighters. After Gold Two was wounded, Ezra volunteered to fly her Y-wing starfighter into combat as part of Gold Squadron. Under Vander's instructions, Ezra and his fellow fliers fired their [[ion cannon]]s at the light cruiser and bombed it. This allowed Gold Squadron, Mothma and her crew, and the Spectres to flee into hyperspace aboard the ''Ghost'' and their Y-wing starfighters. Mothma was forced to abandon her stricken freighter.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nWhile traveling through hyperspace aboard Gold Two's Y-wing, Ezra corresponded with his fellow Spectres and Mothma via intercom. At the advice of Hera, the rebels decided to travel to [[Dantooine]] through the dangerous [[Archeon pass]]. Mothma wanted to travel to Dantooine in order to rally the rebel cells into an [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. While traveling through the Archeon nebula, Ezra became friendly with Jon Vander. When Vander expressed concerns about the danger of the [[Archeon Nebula]], Ezra reassured him that Hera was a good pilot who knew what she was doing.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nDuring the journey, the rebel convoy was attacked by a prototype TIE Defender flown by Commander Vult Skerris and two TIE Interceptors. Knowing the TIE Defender from a previous undercover mission on Lothal, Ezra tried to warn his fellow Gold Squadron fliers but Jon Vander ignored his warning and sent [[Tyson (Gold Squadron)|Gold Three]] and [[Gold Four (Archeon Nebula)|Gold Four]] to engage the enemy fighter. The TIE Defender was protected by deflector shields and easily destroyed the two rebel fighters.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nHera ordered the remaining Gold Squadron fighters to travel deeper into the Archeon pass. Another pilot [[Gold Five (Archeon Nebula)|Gold Five]] was killed while she was trying to protect the ''Ghost''. The rebels managed to lose two of the pursuing TIE Interceptors to the intense heat of the nebula but were unable to outrun Skerris' Defender fighter. To save Senator Mothma, Ezra convinced Hera to let him and Vander stay behind the TIE Defender while the ''Ghost'' exited the Nebula first. Following a brief dogfight, Vander managed to temporarily disable Skerris' TIE Defender.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nThe two rebel pilots then rejoined the ''Ghost'' outside the Archeon Nebula. There, they found the ''Ghost'' being drawn by a [[tractor beam]] into one of Governor Pryce's Star Destroyers. At Hera's request, Ezra and Jon fired [[proton torpedo]]es into the nebula. This created an explosion which damaged both Star Destroyers and allowed them to jump into hyperspace. Above Dantooine, Ezra met with his fellow rebels and Mothma's team aboard the ''Ghost''. Gold Two praised Ezra for his skills as a pilot. The rebels then watched Mothma give a speech [[Declaration of the Rebel Alliance|announcing]] the formation of the Rebel Alliance. Shortly later, they were joined by the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|rebel fleet]] and beginning the [[Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\n===Alliance to Restore the Republic===\n====Saving Chopper from himself====\n[[File:Spectres_and_Wedge_DAD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra helped getting Chopper back to normal after being reprogrammed.]]\nEzra and Zeb waited with Hera aboard the ''Ghost'' while Wedge departed with AP-5 and Chopper on a [[Mission to recover Imperial codes|mission]] to steal clearance codes for Lothal from the Imperial Security Bureau [[Killun Station|station]] on [[Killun 71]]. Ezra and Zeb exchanged jokes about the droids giving Antilles trouble. However, Hera reassured them that she had the best team for the job. While AP-5 succeeded in obtaining the clearance codes, Chopper was remotely reprogrammed by the listener crew of an Imperial ''Gozanti''-class cruiser after connecting to a [[network terminal]] at the base. When Wedge and AP-5 returned, Ezra and Zeb were playing a game of [[dejarik]] aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name=\"DAD\">{{Rebels|Double Agent Droid}}</ref>\n\nWhen AP-5 voiced suspicions about Chopper's change in behavior and Wedge joked about the two droids playing spy games, Ezra and Zeb laughed. However, Hera listened to AP-5's warning and narrowly stopped Chopper from downloading the ship's hyperspace logs. Hera then warned Ezra and the others about Chopper's suspicious behavior. When the rebels went to find Chopper in the engine room, Ezra chided AP-5 for questioning the idea of staying together during their search. AP-5's warning proved right when the Imperial-controlled Chopper sealed the Spectres, Wedge, and AP-5 in the cargo hold and attempted to expose them to [[Realspace|zero gravity space]]. After Hera managed to manually seal the hatch, the rebels sent AP-5 to open the doors to the cargo bay from outside the ship.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nWhile Chopper tangled with AP-5, Ezra and the other Spectres made their way to the cockpit. While Zeb stunned Chopper with his bo-rifle, Ezra removed the [[Computer spike|data spike]] that the Imperial-controlled Chopper had inserted into the [[navigation computer]]; sabotaging the Imperial download. While Zeb tended to Chopper and plugged him into the ''Ghost''{{'s}} systems, Ezra noted Hera's anger at the Imperials who had [[Slicer|sliced]] into Chopper's systems. Ezra and the other rebels watched as Hera confronted the Imperials using Chopper's visual processor and transmitted a heavy data feed which overwhelmed the ''Gozanti'' cruiser's systems and destroyed the ship. Despite their dislike for Chopper, he and Ezra were visibly sad when a distraught Hera pleaded with Chopper's programming to come back. Shortly later, Chopper rebooted and returned to his former programming.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nEzra, Zeb, Wedge, and an apologetic Chopper later greeted AP-5 at the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cargo hold. The rebels had rescued AP-5 from space. However, AP-5 was unhappy at his moment of solitude being disturbed and took the opportunity to argue with Chopper. Ezra watched as Chopper whacked AP-5 in frustration and accidentally struck Wedge.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\n====Mission to Tatooine====\n[[File:320-trivia-gallery-03_a56c8927.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Holocron fragments guided Ezra to Tatooine.]]\nWhile Ezra was sleeping, he opens right eye and dilates his pupil awoken by Kanan's Jedi holocron, which began playing back Kenobi's recording instructing the Jedi to avoid the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] following the Jedi Purge. After entering Kanan's quarters, Ezra saw the Malachor Sith holocron glow with a visage of Maul. Ezra related the incident to Kanan, Hera, Rex, Commander Sato, and Chopper. Kanan was unsure while Rex believed that Kenobi had perished. Meanwhile, Hera counselled Ezra to ignore the incident with the holocrons and focus on his upcoming mission to Lothal. Ezra publicly agreed but resolved to find Kenobi on the desert planet of Tatooine.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>\n\nThe following day, Ezra distracted a rebel trooper manning Chopper Base's airfield with a faux munitions order and stole an RZ-1T trainer. He then traveled to Tatooine and found that Chopper had stowed aboard. Using the Jedi and Sith holocrons, Ezra instructed Chopper to fly to what he believed was Kenobi's coordinates. Upon arriving, Ezra discovered that the source of the transmission was a fragment of the Sith holocron. Before they could leave, the two were attacked by [[Tusken Raider]]s, who destroyed the RZ-1T. Maul resurfaced and then killed the Tuskens before retreating.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\nStranded on Tatooine, Ezra and Chopper traveled through the canyon which led to a vast desert. While Chopper proposed traveling along the ridge to find a settlement, Ezra was led by Maul to travel into the desert. While traveling through the desert, Ezra and Chopper were buffeted by a sandstorm and the scorching heat. Ezra was also tormented by apparitions of Maul. After Chopper broke down, Ezra regretted not heeding Hera's instructions. Overcome by heat, Ezra saw a mirage of Maul and tried to attack it before falling unconscious and Ezra seeing the Tatooine sun in his pupil and closing his eyelid. Fortunately for them, the two rebels were rescued by Master Kenobi.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\nMaster Kenobi charged up Chopper and gave Ezra a blanket to lie upon. That night, Ezra opens his eye and awoke to find himself in the presence of Kenobi, who told the young Jedi that he was in the wrong place because Maul had used the holocrons to lead him here. When Ezra proposed pooling their resources together to fight Maul, Kenobi reassured him that he was more than capable of handling the Dark Sider. He told Ezra to return to Atollon to be with the rebellion. Shortly later, Maul turned up to settle his score with Kenobi.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\nKenobi instructed Ezra and Chopper to take his [[dewback]] and head north where Maul's starship ''Nightbrother'' was waiting. While Ezra and Chopper took the ''Nightbrother'' back to Chopper Base, Master Kenobi defeated and killed Maul in single combat, ending the threat of the Dark Sider to the rebels. Meanwhile, Ezra and Chopper returned to Atollon where they were greeted by their fellow Spectres. When Zeb asked if \"this means what I want it to mean,\" Ezra reassured him that Maul would no longer be troubling them. Ezra then apologized to Hera and Kanan for running away and expressed his recognition that his place was with his adoptive family. Ezra and his fellow rebels then reconciled.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\n====Siege of Atollon====\n[[File:Mandalorian_reinforcements.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra helped Sabine and the Mandalorians destroying the ''Interdictor'' cruiser.]]\nPrior to the rebels' planned attack on the TIE Defender factories on Lothal, his master Kanan complimented Ezra for his contributions to the Rebellion. In return, Ezra reassured Kanan that he was a good mentor who had taught him about life and how to be a better person. Ezra and Kanan then attended a briefing at the command center with Hera and the other rebel commanders Commander Sato and [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]], whose [[Massassi Group]] had traveled to the [[Atollon system]] in order to aid Phoenix Squadron's strike against Lothal.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>\n\nBefore the rebels could launch their attack on Lothal, they received a garbled transmission from Agent Kallus that Thrawn \"knew.\" Recalling their [[Battle of Garel|previous experience]] on Garel, Ezra believed that Thrawn had discovered the location of Chopper Base and successful convinced Hera to order the rebel ships to assume battle station mode. Ezra's warning proved timely as Thrawn's [[7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] entered the Atollon system. The Imperial fleet cut of all escape by deploying an [[interdictor vessel]] to prevent any jumps into hyperspace.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nTrapped, Hera devised a plan for the rebels to attack the blockade so that they could find an opening big enough to send one ship into hyperspace to bring reinforcements. Hera assigned Ezra and Kanan to the mission because she believed that the Jedi had a greater chance of success. For the mission, she assigned Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper to fly the ''Nightbrother'' through the blockade. After Kanan turned down the mission in order to warn Bendu, Hera assigned the mission to Ezra and Chopper. During the space battle, Ezra flew his Gauntlet as the ''Ghost'' and the rebel fleet launched an attack on Thrawn's fleet in order to find an opening. Due to the tightly packed Imperial formation and the TIE fighter swarms, the rebels sustained heavy casualties. However, Ezra and Chopper managed to escape after Commander Sato rammed his flagship ''Phoenix Nest'' into Admiral Konstantine's interdictor cruiser.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nAfter fleeing into hyperspace, Ezra tried to solicit Mon Mothma's help but the rebel leader refused because she was unwilling to expose the Rebel Alliance's true strength to Thrawn. Desperate, Ezra traveled to Krownest in order to petition Sabine for help. Sabine's mother Ursa, brother Tristan, and Rau were reluctant to intervene because Clan Wren was bogged down in a [[Mandalorian Civil War (Imperial Era)|civil war]] against [[Clan Saxon]]. Assuming their final answer was \"no,\" Ezra stated that he and Chopper would go back alone. However, Sabine replied she would follow them. This convinced Ursa to relent and she allowed the rebels to recruit Mandalorian volunteers and starships for the [[Battle of Atollon]]. Ezra's reinforcements included several Mandalorian warriors and a squadron of Fang fighters led by Fenn Rau.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nEzra and Sabine traveled back to Atollon on the ''Nightbrother''. While Chopper manned the ship, Ezra, Sabine, and several Mandalorian warriors equipped with jetpacks landed on Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser. They proceeded to blow up the ship's gravity well projectors. Despite opposition from Jumptroopers, the rebels managed to destroy the cruiser and disable the interdiction field. This allowed the surviving rebel ships led by Hera to flee into hyperspace. After returning to the ''Ghost'', Kanan met Ezra in the rear turret and commended his apprentice for helping Sabine to save the day. When Ezra expressed despondence about the defeat, Kanan reassured his apprentice that they were still alive to fight for the galaxy's freedom. The rebels then traveled to [[Yavin 4]].<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\n====War on Mandalore====\n=====Rescuing Alrich=====\nAfter regrouping at Yavin 4, Ezra along with Kanan, Chopper, and Fenn Rau accompanied Sabine and Clan Wren on a [[Mission to Mandalore|mission]] to rescue Sabine's father [[Alrich Wren]], who was facing execution at the hands of the Imperial puppet Governor [[Tiber Saxon]]. The rebels and Mandalorians staged an attack on the [[Mandalore prison outpost]] that was purportedly housing Alrich. During the skirmish, Ezra donned a jetpack that had been loaned to him. While Ezra did not know how to fly a jetpack, Sabine told him to figure it out.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the assault, Ezra struggled to control the jetpack. Despite taking the Imperial forces by surprise, the defending Jumptroopers soon regained the upper hand and attempted to force the rebels and their Mandalorian allies to surrender. However, the rebel forces were aided by several [[Clan Kryze]] warriors affiliated with [[Bo-Katan Kryze]], the former [[regent]] of Mandalore who had turned against the Empire. Despite this victory, the rebels and their Mandalorian allies were dismayed to learn that Alrich had already been evacuated.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\nAfter receiving intelligence from Ursa that Alrich was being transported to the Mandalorian capital [[Sundari]] for execution, Ezra participated in a joint Mandalorian and rebel raid on the Imperial convoy ferrying Alrich. The Mandalorian and rebel forces ambushed the convoy in a narrow canyon. While Sabine, Bo-Katan, Rau, and Kanan attacked the convoy, Ezra flew with his jetpack to the middle Imperial Troop Transport, which was carrying Alrich. Ezra managed to breach the transport and fought off the drivers and Imperial Super Commandos inside. After freeing Alrich, Ezra gave him his jetpack, explaining that he was better off without one.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\nAlrich exited the transport before it hurtled down a cliff. Ezra then used his Force powers to [[Force jump|jump]] out of the falling transport. Despite his Force powers, Ezra failed to grab the edge of the cliff and was only saved from death by Sabine. While the rebels and Mandalorians were jubilant, their victory was overshadowed by news that the Empire had deployed an [[Arc Pulse Generator]] known as the \"Duchess\" against Ursa and Tristan's Clan Wren forces. The Duchess was capable of reacting with the [[beskar]] alloy inside [[Mandalorian armor]] and incinerating Mandalorian warriors.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\n=====Destroying the Duchess=====\nWhen Sabine wept at the sight of the charred armor and bodies, Ezra tried to comfort her by telling her it was not her fault. Sabine then revealed that she had created the Duchess while studying at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore. Fortunately for Sabine, the rebels and Mandalorians discovered that Ursa and Tristan had survived. The allied forces were then attacked by Imperial super commandos and TIE fighters. The group managed to escape due to the arrival of one of Bo-Katan's ships. Since Ezra was armed with a jetpack, he and Bo-Katan were sent to take out two of the TIE fighters. While Bo-Katan easily destroyed her TIE fighter, Ezra struggled to pry open the hatch of his target. However, he managed to take out the fighter by using the rocket in his jetpack.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\nBack aboard Bo-Katan's ship, Ezra learned more about the Duchess from Sabine including beskar alloy. When Ezra innocently asked why the Mandalorians could not use another metal beside beskar to build their armor, Sabine and Alrich explained that Mandalorian armor were considered to be priceless family heirlooms. After arriving at Bo-Katan's camp, Sabine agreed to destroy the Duchess in order to atone for her role in creating it. The rebels and Mandalorians devised a plan to infiltrate [[Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer]] above Sundari and destroy the weapon. Ezra along with Kanan and Chopper volunteered to help erase the data from the Imperial database while Sabine and Bo-Katan agreed to destroy the machine.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\nThat night, the joint Mandalorian-rebel forces infiltrated Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer. Despite being spotted by Imperial sentries, Ezra along with Kanan and Chopper managed to head towards the Imperial network terminal where the database was stored. While Chopper erased the data, Ezra and his master Kanan fought off Imperial stormtroopers. When the group received no contact from Sabine, Kanan sent Ezra to help her. Meanwhile, Sabine and Bo-Katan were ambushed by Tiber Saxon, who tried to force Sabine to strengthen the arc pulse generator. However, Sabine instead reprogrammed the weapon to target [[stormtrooper armor]], incapacitating Saxon and most of his men.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\nEzra managed to fling off his scout trooper helmet. By the time he reached the upper deck, Sabine had destroyed the arc pulse generator. The rebels and Mandalorians then escaped as the Star Destroyer exploded and crashed outside Sundari. Back at Bo-Katan's camp, Ezra and his rebel comrades were present when Sabine convinced Bo-Katan to take up the Darksaber and the mantle of leadership over the Mandalorian clans. The rebels then watched as the Mandalorian clans pledged loyalty to Bo-Katan.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" />\n\n====The Jalindi Relay====\nLater, Ezra traveled on the ''Gauntlet'' with Kanan, Sabine, and Chopper to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. During the journey, Ezra talked to Kanan about the Rebel Alliance forces there. Upon landing at the [[Great Temple]], they were greeted by Zeb. Shortly later, Hera's squadron of Y-wings returned from a supply mission. The squadron had been attacked by Imperial forces and had sustained damage. Hera's damaged Y-wing made a hard landing and narrowly avoiding colliding with Ezra and the other Spectres. Shortly later, Kallus informed the Spectres that Mon Mothma had requested a meeting with them.<ref name=\"In the Name\">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref>\n\nDuring the meeting, Mon Mothma and Senator Bail Organa revealed that the Empire had been disrupting rebel supply missions using a [[Jalindi Station|relay station]] on [[Jalindi]]. The Alliance had obtained this intelligence from Saw Gerrera's partisans; whose tactics the Alliance leadership disapproved off. At the recommendation of Kallus, the Spectres accepted a [[Mission to Jalindi|mission]] to tap into the Jalindi relay's transmissions. Following the briefing, Ezra petitioned Mon Mothma about aiding his homeworld of Lothal. While sympathetic, Mothma told him that thousands of other worlds including her homeworld of [[Chandrila]] were suffering under Imperial rule and told him to think of the bigger picture. She also cautioned Ezra that Thrawn's attack on Atollon showed that the Rebellion was unprepared for a full-scale war with the Empire.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\nLater that evening, Ezra confided in Kanan that Saw's tactics seemed to be gaining results. The two then witnessed a hologram confrontation between Saw Gerrera and Mon Mothma. Saw derided Mothma for her alleged ineffective tactics while Mothma denounced Saw as a war criminal and terrorist who tortured prisoners and killed civilians. The Spectres then traveled to Jalindi aboard the ''Ghost''. Their plan was to drop Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper onto the Jalindi relay's dish so that they could install a spike to tap into the dish's transmissions. To avoid detection, the rebels were instructed not to activate their jetpacks until the last minute.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\nEzra and his comrades landed safely on the Jalindi relay station's dish. Before the trio could complete their mission, they were interrupted by the arrival of the Imperial light cruiser ''[[Marauder]]'', which was commanded by Commander Brom Titus, an old enemy of Ezra. When Ezra claimed to be Titus, an enraged Titus contacted the relay's garrison, who dispatched stormtroopers to apprehend the infiltrators. While Ezra fought the troopers, Sabine tried to plant detonators while Chopper realigned the dish to disorientate the stormtroopers. While the ''Ghost'' tangled with Titus' starfighters, a [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]] piloted by Saw and the Partisan [[Edrio]] arrived above the relay.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\nSaw picked up Ezra and his comrades before destroying the Jalindi relay and Titus' light cruiser with proton bombs. Before Hera could dock with Saw's U-wing, the rebels were scattered by an Imperial Star Destroyer. Before jumping into hyperspace, Saw invited Ezra and Sabine to \"fight with a real army for a change.\"<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\n====Soldiering with Saw Gerrera====\nWhile traveling through hyperspace, Ezra and his comrades learned that Saw was still investigating the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|cause]] of the Sterilization of Geonosis. Saw briefed the rebels that he had obtained intelligence that the Empire was secretly moving cargo through [[Faos Station]]. Despite Chopper's objections, Ezra and Sabine voted to join Saw's mission. At Faos Station, Ezra, Sabine, Chopper, and Saw infiltrated [[Freighter 2716]] using a crate. Edrio followed their freighter in a U-wing using Saw's tracker. Once aboard, the rebels discovered an Imperial shuttle aboard the freighter, which was traveling to the empty [[Tonnis sector]]. The rebels also found that hold 17 was a restricted area.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\nWith the help of Chopper, Ezra and the other rebels subdued the stormtroopers guarding hold 17. Inside, they encountered several power and reactor technicians who had been conscripted by the Empire for an unknown project including the [[Ishi Tib]] [[Mich Matt]]. After subduing a second group of guards, Ezra proposed evacuating the prisoners aboard the Imperial shuttle in hold 12. Sabine countered that it was guarded and proposed sabotaging the hyperdrive so that they could escape in escape pods. While Ezra and the others headed to the hyperdrive, Chopper led the liberated prisoners to the escape pods.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\n[[File:In_the_Name_of_the_Rebellion_thumb.jpg|thumb|right|250x250px|Ezra and Sabine joined Saw on a mission to try to discover the secret of the Empire that led to the Sterilization of Geonosis.]]\nWhile heading to the hyperdrive, Ezra heard singing through the Force from one of the doors. Inside, the rebels encountered and subdued a squad of [[Death trooper]]s. Inside the chamber, the rebels discovered that the freighter was carrying a large kyber crystal; whose presence Ezra could sense through the Force. However, the death trooper commander [[DT-F16]] managed to escape and alerted the ship's captain [[Wells]]; who jettisoned all escape pods. While Saw insisted on following the freighter to its destination, Ezra and Sabine argued that the prisoners' well-being was more important.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\nWhile Saw guarded the crystal, Ezra and Sabine headed to the hyperdrive chamber and subdued the guards. Before they could disable the hyperdrive, Saw stunned and restrained the two Spectres. After awakening, they discovered that Saw had brought the kyber crystal into the engine room. Shortly later, the freighter exited hyperspace only to find itself in empty space with a Star Destroyer approaching. The rebels then realized that the freighter was rendezvousing with the Star Destroyer to deliver the kyber crystal.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\nIn frustration, Saw destabilized the kyber crystal with Ezra's lightsaber. Ezra and Sabine managed to convince Saw to release them but declined his offer for a ride. While Saw departed aboard the U-wing with Edrio, Ezra instructed Chopper to bring the prisoners to hangar 12. Ezra and Sabine then race to join Chopper and the prisoners. After fighting DT-F16 and the remaining Imperials, the rebels and the civilians escaped aboard the stolen Imperial shuttle. Shortly later, the freighter and the Star Destroyer were destroyed by the kyber crystal.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\nThe rebels' hijacked shuttle escaped the explosion but its engines were damaged. Fortunately for the rebels, they were rescued by the ''Ghost''. The liberated prisoners joined the Rebellion out of gratitude. Sabine and Ezra briefed Kanan about their encounter with the kyber crystal aboard the freighter. While Sabine speculated whether it was possible to weaponize the kyber crystals, Ezra remarked that the Empire was winning a war that most of the Rebel Alliance was unwilling to acknowledge.<ref name=\"In the Name\" />\n\n====Return to Lothal====\nWhile the ''Ghost'' was approaching Yavin 4, Ezra experienced a Force vision of Old Jho and Ryder Azadi on Lothal. After returning to the Great Temple, the Spectres were briefed by Mon Mothma about Azadi's intelligence that the Empire was developing a new [[TIE/D Defender Elite|TIE/D Defender starfighter]] on Lothal. Due to the vision, Ezra volunteered and was joined by the other Spectres. Despite the Imperial lockdown and the poor prospect of successful evacuation, Ezra was determined to return to his homeworld to help his people.<ref name=\"The Occupation\">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>\n\nThe Spectres managed to convince the criminal Cikatro Vizago to smuggle them into the city of [[Jhothal]]. After landing, the rebels split up to escape an Imperial patrol. Ezra along with Sabine and Chopper visited Old Jho's Pit Stop only to discover that Jho had already been executed by the Empire who had taken over his cantina. The cantina was now managed by the Imperial pilot [[Baron]] Valen Rudor, an old adversary of the Spectres. When Rudor ridiculed Jho's death, Ezra was enraged but Sabine cautioned him to maintain his cool. Rudor recognized Ezra but could not recall his name.<ref name=\"The Occupation\" />\n\nBefore Rudor could question them further, an old friend named Jai Kell entered the cantina and volunteered to pay for Ezra and Sabine's drinks. Kell had since joined Ryder's Lothal resistance and told them that he had been sent by Ryder to lead them to the rendezvous point. After reuniting with the other Spectres, Ezra and the rebels navigated their way through Jhothal's sewers using [[Starbird (symbol)|Starbird]] graffiti to guide them. Despite being pursued by Imperial forces, the rebels managed to exit the sewers and rendezvous with Ryder, who evacuated them in a U-wing.<ref name=\"The Occupation\" />\n\n====Stealing the TIE Defender Elite====\n=====An unexpected dogfight=====\nLater, Ezra along with Sabine, Zeb, and Ryder Azadi stalked the [[Lothal Imperial airfield|Imperial testing facility]] where the TIE/D Defender Elite was being stabled. For the mission, Ezra maintained contact with Hera and Kanan, who were based at his former tower. Hera ordered Ezra to keep watch until nightfall and then return to base. After sighting the Defender Elite, Sabine proposed stealing the fighter's [[flight data recorder]] to aid the Alliance war effort. While Zeb and Ryder were skeptical of the plan, Ezra supported Sabine and joined her in infiltrating the testing facility.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\nAs they approached the TIE Defender Elite, they found it guarded by two stormtrooper sentries. Before Ezra and Sabine could stage a distraction, the guards were distracted by two loth-cats. While Ezra kept watch, Sabine began extracting the flight data recorder from the Defender Elite. Before they could finish, Grand Admiral Thrawn and Governor Pryce arrived in an Imperial shuttle to witness a test demonstration of the Defender Elite. Ezra attempted to stage a distraction but was spotted by a TIE fighter pilot. Ezra fought off the stormtroopers and managed to tell Zeb and Ryder that he and Sabine would find their way out.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\nWith death troopers closing in on them, Ezra and Sabine escaped aboard the TIE Defender Elite. Before fleeing the base on the stolen fighter, Sabine destroyed several vehicles and even menaced Thrawn. Once airborne, Sabine tasked Ezra with flying the stolen fighter while she disabled its homing beacon.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" /> Suspecting the ship was piloted by the relatively inexperienced Bridger and seeking to exploit the situation as a makeshift test of the fighter's capabilities, Thrawn dispatched three TIE Interceptors in pursuit. During the subsequent chase, Ezra managed to down the pursuing fighters with the Defender Elite's armament, leading Thrawn to conclude that the Defender Elite could make a lethal ace out of even an amateur pilot.<ref name=\"TIE Fighter Owners' Workshop Manual\">''[[TIE Fighter Owners' Workshop Manual]]''</ref> However, Sabine then discovered that the fighter had a kill-switch.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\nGovernor Pryce activated the kill-switch, causing the Defender Elite to discard its wings. Ezra managed to land the fighter on its remaining wing. Having extracted the flight data recorder, Ezra and Sabine also removed and hid the ship's hyperdrive. Sabine recognized that Ryder Azadi's U-wing could make use of the down Defender Elite's hyperdrive. Ezra and Sabine managed to flee the site before Imperial forces arrived and dodged Imperial police gunships. While traveling through the wilderness, Ezra and Sabine encountered a [[loth-wolf]], a mythical creature long believed to be extinct.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\nThe loth-wolf approached Sabine and caused her to fall asleep. When Ezra confronted the loth-wolf, a white loth-cat appeared on the wolf's head, reassuring and surprising Ezra. With the Empire still searching them, Ezra convinced the loth-wolf to give him and Sabine a ride. The loth-wolf brought the two to a clearing where they reunited with Hera and Kanan, who had arrived in a U-wing. After handing the flight data recorder, Ezra related his encounter with the loth-wolf to Kanan. While Kanan could offer no answers, he reassured Ezra that all paths were coming together.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\n=====Recovering the hyperdrive=====\nThe following day, Ezra returned with Jai Kell and Zeb to recover the hyperdrive for Ryder's U-wing Due to the Imperial manhunt, the two wore scout trooper armor. Ezra and Kell initially had trouble locating the hyperdrive until they were guided there by a loth-cat. Before they could return to the [[Lothal resistance camp]], Ezra and Kell were confronted by the [[Noghri]] tracker [[Rukh]], who had been sent by Grand Admiral Thrawn to hunt them down. Despite trying to pass themselves off as Imperials, Rukh saw through their disguise and attacked them. Following a struggle, Ezra and Kell escaped into the wilderness on a speeder bike while Zeb returned to the base with the hyperdrive.<ref name=\"Kindred\">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>\n\nEzra and Kell were pursued by Rukh and two scout troopers. The rebels led them into a maze of rockspires. Rukh attacked Ezra with his [[electrostaff]] but Ezra blocked the attack with his lightsaber. Despite losing Rukh, the Noghri tracker managed to install a tracking device on their bike. With the Imperials closing in, Ezra planted a detonator on a partially-collapsed rock spire. One of the scout troopers was crushed by the resulting explosion while the other was knocked off his transport. Rukh however rode his bike over the debris. Ezra managed to shoot and destroy the vehicle, allowing him and Kell to flee back to the rebel camp.<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\nFollowing Zeb's return to the camp, Ezra and Kell arrived on their bike. While Hera and Chopper escaped with the flight data recorder on Ryder's U-wing. With Imperial forces under Governor Pryce closing in, the rebels fled the camp and encountered a pack of loth-wolves who led them into a network of underground tunnels and caves, which led to Lothal's southern hemisphere. While inside one of the caves, Ezra took an interest in the cave paintings of loth-wolves and likened the cave to the Lothal Jedi Temple. After interacting with the wolves, he and Kanan realized that the creatures were connected to Lothal through the Force. After the wolf disappeared into one of the cave paintings, Ezra remarked that \"all paths were coming together.\" Ezra also asked Kanan if Hera and Chopper were safe and Kanan reassured his apprentice.<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\n====Liberating prisoners====\nAfter setting up [[Lothal cliff dwelling|base]] in the Lothal caves, Ezra and the other rebels explored the surrounding landscape. They encountered the Mining Guild [[ore crawler]] [[Crawler 413-24]], which was digging up Lothal's surface for minerals. At the insistence of Zeb, the group decided to hijack the ore crawler. After Sabine subdued the [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|sentry droid]], Ryder brought up his speeder so that the rebels could board the crawler. Once aboard, Ezra helped Zeb to subdue the Trandoshan Mining Guild captain [[Seevor]]. When Seevor alerted the Imperial authorities, Ezra mimicked the Trandoshan's voice and tried to convince the Mining Guild authorities that they were having mechanical difficulties but that they had the situation under control. With Seevor restrained and unconscious, Kanan and Zeb liberated the prisoners including Vizago, who had smuggled them into Lothal. In the process, Zeb fought and threw the Mining Guild foreman [[Proach]] to his death.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>\n\nDespite Ezra's efforts, the Mining Guild still dispatched two Imperial police gunships to investigate the commotion. While Zeb disguised himself as a foreman and Vizago as the driver, Ezra along with Kanan and Sabine hid in the closet until the Imperials had conducted their search. Though the Imperials left, Seevor managed to escape into the ventilators and deactivated the reactors. Ezra entered the engine room to restart the reactors but was attacked by Seevor. Ezra fought back with his lightsaber but Seevor proved to be a cunning opponent. Seevor managed to separate Ezra from his lightsaber and threw him against the guard-rail. However, Ezra then used the Force to cause Seevor to trip over his lightsaber and plunge into his death inside the smelter.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\" />\n\nVizago and the liberated slaves decided to join the Rebellion out of gratitude to their liberators. Shortly later, Ezra and the other rebels received news from Hera that Rebel Command had authorized a [[Attack on Lothal|strike]] on Lothal to knock out the Imperial factories. Ezra and his comrades were enlisted as the Alliance's ground support team. Ezra and his fellow rebels cheered and vowed to assist Hera.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\" />\n\n====Strike on Lothal====\nAs part of the long&ndash;planned rebel strike on Lothal, Ezra along with Kanan, Sabine, and Zeb served as the rebel ground support team. To assist Hera's [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] assault on the Imperial Armory Complex, Ezra and his fellow Spectres were tasked with planting explosives on ground-based anti-air defenses. After planting their explosives, Ezra contacted Ryder, whose group had also finished planting their explosives. As the attack on Lothal began, Ezra and his team departed on their speeder bikes. When Ezra insisted on driving their speeder bike, Zeb yanked Ezra onto the backseat. Despite taking out the anti-air defenses, the Rebel Alliance was forced to abandon their assault after Thrawn's Seventh Fleet wiped out much of Hera's starfighter force. When Kanan decided to return to Capital City to rescue Hera, Sabine insisted that they follow their leader. However, Ezra reassured her that Kanan would handle the situation.<ref name=\"Rebel Assault\">{{Rebels|Rebel Assault}}</ref>\n\n====Rescuing Hera====\nUnder the guidance of Kanan, Ezra took leadership of Hera's [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|rescue mission]]. After meditating in the Force, Ezra sensed that Hera was being held at the Dome, the center of Imperial power on Lothal. Since [[Pryce's office]] was located on the 157th level of the complex, Ezra proposed infiltrating the building using [[Glider (vehicle)|gliders]]. Sabine supported Ezra's plan knowing that the Empire's technology would be designed to counter sophisticated weapons and targets rather than primitive gliders. Under Ezra's leadership, the Spectres with the exception of Kanan worked to build three [[loth-bat glider]]s.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\">{{Rebels|Jedi Night}}</ref>\n\nKanan approved of Ezra's plan. For the mission, Ezra and Sabine donned stole [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilot]] uniforms since they were operating undercover. Ezra, Kanan, and Sabine rode on the gliders as Zeb and Chopper used a speeder bike to tow them into the air. The rebels managed to use the gliders to reach the Dome's south garbage chute. While Kanan went to rescue Hera, Ezra and Sabine headed to the Dome's hangar bay. After Kanan and Hera escaped on one of the gliders, Ezra and Sabine posed as pilots and managed to commandeer a police gunship. Ezra told the stormtrooper commander that he was a back-up pilot.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\nAfter learning that Kanan and Hera had reached the [[Lothal City fuel depot]], Sabine and Ezra got rid of their stormtrooper passengers before taking out the other gunships. Sabine managed to shoot down one gunship while Ezra managed to use his lightsaber to take out another. Ezra and Sabine arrived at the fuel depot to find Hera and Kanan embracing. Before they could leave, Governor Pryce arrived with several AT-AT walkers and bombarded the fuel depot, creating an explosion. Kanan used the Force to hold back the explosive wave but was [[Death|killed]]. The surviving rebels then returned to their cliff base.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" />\n\n====Mourning Kanan's passing====\nAfter returning to the Lothal rebel base, Ezra and the other Spectres mourned the loss of their comrade Kanan, whom Ezra regarded as a father figure and master. When Ryder suggested calling Yavin 4 for reinforcements, Ezra believed that the fight on Lothal was over. Ezra then took leave to mourne Kanan's passing. While sitting on a rock, Ezra complained that Kanan had not prepared him for his death. Ezra was then approached by three loth-wolves which chased him into the nearby grasslands. The leader of the pack was a large white loth-wolf known as [[Dume (Loth-wolf)|Dume]]. Ezra was knocked unconscious by one of the smaller wolves.<ref name=\"DUME\">{{Rebels|DUME}}</ref>\n\nWhen Ezra awoke, he found himself sitting under a Lothalian mound. Lost, he began chanting the riddle \"[[Loth-rat]], Loth-cat, Loth-wolf, pick a path and all is done\" before falling asleep again. Later that night, he was awoken by the loth-wolf pack. Their leader introduced himself as \"Dume\" and chastised Ezra for running away. Ezra responded that the wolves were chasing him and said that he was lost without his master. When Ezra told the wolf that he was afraid, Dume told him to fight together and showed him a [[Lothal Jedi Temple key stone|carved stone]] from the Lothal Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"DUME\" />\n\nEzra admitted that he, Kanan, and Tano accidentally led the Empire to the Lothal Jedi Temple. Dume warned the secrets within the temple were in danger.\nWhen Ezra asked what lay inside the temple, Dume responded that the temple contained the knowledge to destruction. Ezra countered that Tano had said that they would find the secrets to destroying the Sith on Malachor but that they were wrong. Dume then told him to restore the past and redeem the future before lunging at Ezra. Ezra then awoke and realized he had been dreaming. After finding the Jedi key stone lying at his feet, Ezra returned to the rebel camp. There, he encountered Hera, who had made peace with Kanan's death, and Sabine and Zeb, who had discovered that the rebels had succeeded in knocking out the TIE Defender factory on Lothal. Ezra then told them that their next mission was to stop the Empire from harnessing the Lothal Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"DUME\" />\n\n====Return to the Lothal Jedi Temple====\n=====Behind enemy lines=====\nAfter briefing his fellow Spectres about the [[Mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple|mission]] to the Lothal Jedi Temple, Ezra summoned a pack of loth-wolves including \"Dume.\" Ezra and his fellow rebels rode on the loth-wolves to the Jedi Temple. Though the Jedi Temple was located in Lothal's northern hemisphere, the wolves were able to hasten the journey by generating [[hyper tunnel]]s. When Hera and Zeb asked how the wolves did that, Ezra admitted he did not know but recalled that Kanan had told him that the wolves were deeply connected to the Force. Upon arriving at the Jedi Temple, the rebels discovered that the Empire and Mining Guild had set up camp and were [[Excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple|excavating]] the ancient structure.<ref name=\"Wolves and a Door\">{{Rebels|Wolves and a Door}}</ref>\n\nEzra and Sabine infiltrated the camp disguised as scout troopers while their rebel comrades monitored the situation from the perimeter. While examining several artifacts, the two rebels encountered the Imperial Minister [[Veris Hydan]], who reprimanded them for touching the objects. Hydan then left to confer with the Emperor, leaving a death trooper commander to deal with the scout troopers. Before the death trooper could question them further, Ezra used a Jedi mind trick to convinced the man to forget the matter.<ref name=\"Wolves and a Door\" />\n\nWith the help of Chopper, the rebels intercepted Hydan's hologram conversation with the Emperor. They learned that the Emperor was interested in accessing a mysterious [[portal]] using a [[Painting of the Mortis gods]]. Despite the presence of the Emperor, Ezra and his fellow Spectres resolved to complete their mission. Ezra and Sabine then attempted to unlock the mural using the key stone the loth-wolves had provided and the latter's knowledge of art. Though Sabine was subsequently taken away for questioning by stormtroopers, Ezra managed to use the [[Daughter]]'s hand on the mural to unlock the portal. Ezra managed to enter the portal before Minister Hydan and his men could detain him.<ref name=\"Wolves and a Door\" />\n\n=====The World Between Worlds=====\n{{Quote|Ezra? You look... Wait, what happened? Where am I?\"<br>\"You were fighting Vader. I saw you in there. He was going to... So I... I grabbed you, and I pulled you out of there.|Ahsoka Tano and Ezra, after he pulled her into the World Between Worlds|A World Between Worlds}}\n[[File:AlterFate-SoH.png|thumb|left|250px|Bridger's hand reaches from the World Between Worlds towards Tano]]\nAfter emerging from the portal, Ezra found himself within a mystical dimension known as the [[World Between Worlds]], which connected space and time. He also heard various voices from the past, present, and future yet to come. While walking along a long bridge which led to various portals, Ezra encountered a [[convor]], a creature associated with the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano. The convor led Ezra to a portal where he saw Tano fighting with Darth Vader after being separated during their [[Mission to Malachor]] two years ago. Before the Sith Lord could finish her off, Ezra pulled Tano through the portal.<ref name=\"AWBW\">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref>\n\nTano was initially shocked but thanked Ezra and the convor, which she named [[Morai]], for saving her life. Ezra then informed Tano that a few years had past since the events of Malachor. Ezra and Tano then talked about the World Between Worlds, which Ezra likened to a dream he experienced after Kanan died. Tano explained that Kanan had transferred his will into a white loth-wolf called \"Dume\" and had become part of the [[Cosmic Force]]. Believing that he could also bring back his master, Ezra considered saving Kanan by pulling him out of a portal the moment that he was killed by the blast. However, Tano pointed out that Kanan had sacrificed his life so that Ezra and his comrades could live, and that if he were to pull him out of that point in time, then Ezra and his comrades would perish in the explosion. She convinced Ezra to honor his master's sacrifice.<ref name=\"AWBW\" />\n\nShortly later, Ezra and Tano were attacked by Darth Sidious, who had managed to penetrate the World Between Worlds through the dark side of the Force. While unable to physically enter the realm, Sidious was able to use the dark side to summon blue flames. Ezra and Tano managed to escape the blue flames and return to their portals. Before parting company, Ezra asked Tano to find him when she returned to her time. Tano agreed to honor that promise. Ezra narrowly escaped the Emperor's clutches and returned to the Lothal Jedi Temple. There, he reunited with his fellow rebels, who had rescued Sabine from Minister Hydan.<ref name=\"AWBW\" />\n\nBefore escaping the Lothal Jedi Temple, Ezra convinced Sabine and Zeb to help him seal back the portal. Working together, they managed to use the [[Son]]'s hand to seal back the portal. Ezra was knocked out but Zeb managed to carry him inside a [[Mining Guild excavation driller]] that Chopper had commandeered. As they fled, the Lothal Jedi Temple sunk into the ground, taking Minister Hydan with it. Later, the Spectres returned to the site of the Lothal Jedi Temple. Recalling that this was the site where he and Kanan had stood when they first entered the Temple years ago, Ezra and Hera made peace with Kanan's sacrifice. After seeing the white loth-wolf \"Dume,\" Ezra said goodbye to his master before climbing aboard the excavation driller.<ref name=\"AWBW\" />\n\n====Trapping Governor Pryce====\nWhile Hera traveled offworld to recruit old allies to assist Ezra's plan to [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] Lothal, Ezra convened a meeting of the other Spectres and Ryder's rebel cell to discuss his plan to take Capital City from the Empire. Ezra's plan was to capture Capital City before Grand Admiral Thrawn returned to Lothal. While Ryder Azadi thought that the rebels lacked the numbers needed to seize the city,<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref> Ezra had a plan which involved luring Governor Pryce into a trap at the rebels' cliff dwelling and using her to enter the \"Dome,\" the center of Imperial power on Lothal.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\">{{Rebels|Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell}}</ref>\n\nUnder Ezra's instructions, Ryder Azadi pretended to betray the rebels and revealed the location of their base to Governor Pryce. Seeking to curry favor with Thrawn, Pryce attacked the Lothal cliff dwelling with a fleet of patrol transports, jumptroopers, and stormtroopers. Governor Pryce ordered her men to take Ezra, whom she described as the \"Jedi boy,\" into custody. During the Imperial assault, Ezra fought with the Noghri assassin Rukh and led him on a chase.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\n[[File:Ezras_Wolf_Pack_AFH.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra reveals his \"army\"]]\nEventually, the rebels retreated to a defensive position on top of the Mining Guild ore crawler. In response, Governor Pryce ordered one of her gunships to bombard the ore crawler, causing the structure to collapse. Ezra, Zeb, and their rebel comrades managed to survive the fall but were taken prisoner by Rukh and several stormtroopers. Rukh brought the rebels to Governor Pryce, who gloated over her victory. However, Ezra told Pryce that she had fallen for their ruse.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\nShortly later, Hera returned with reinforcements aboard the ''Ghost'' and landed reinforcements in the form of Rex, Kallus, Gregor, and Wolffe. While the ''Ghost'' took out the remaining Imperial gunships, Ezra led Rukh and the other Imperial pursuers into a cave that was inhabited by a pack of loth-wolves. The loth-wolves attacked and overwhelmed Pryce's stormtroopers with the alpha [[White Loth-wolf|white loth-wolf]] throwing Rukh off a cliff.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\nEzra was present when the white loth-wolf brought Pryce to her. Ezra accepted Pryce's surrender and gave Ryder the \"honor\" of handcuffing her. When Hera praised Ezra for their victory, Ezra thanked her and the rest of the Lothal resistance. While Hondo thought that the fight was over, Ezra reminded his rebel comrades that the next stage of their plan was to drive the Empire from Lothal.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\n====Liberation of Lothal====\n=====Capturing the Dome=====\nFollowing the capture of Pryce, Ezra and his rebel comrades embarked on their next plan to seize the \"Dome,\" the center of Imperial power on Lothal. Using an unwilling Pryce to gain access to the Dome, Ezra and his fellow rebels managed to land their assault force on the Dome's executive landing platform. After a brief skirmish with stormtroopers, Ezra and his rebel comrades managed to capture the Dome's command center.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nWith the help of Kallus and Ryder, the rebels managed to issue a faux [[Protocol 13]], causing the evacuation of all Imperial forces on Lothal. Most of the Imperial garrison boarded the Dome, which turned out to be a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]]. Before Sabine and Chopper could fire the Dome's thrusters, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard his Star Destroyer ''Chimaera'', blocking their path.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nPatching a hologram transmission through to Thrawn, Ezra tried to intimidate the Grand Admiral by claiming that he held his entire army hostage. The strategically-minded Thrawn however countered that the rebels had merely moved the Imperial forces to a safe position, allowing him to bombard Capital City. Under Thrawn's orders, the ''Chimaera'' rained down laser fire on Capital City, destroying several buildings and inflicting casualties.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nUnwilling to let the civilians be harmed, Ezra pleaded with Thrawn to stop. Thrawn then issued an ultimatum for Ezra to meet him aboard the ''Chimaera'' to surrender unconditionally. Despite Hera and Rex's objections, Ezra managed to sneak aboard a patrol transport with the help of Sabine and Chopper. In Ezra's absence, the other rebels embarked on a two-pronged operation to secure the Dome's power terminals and restart the shield generator.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\n=====Facing Thrawn and the Emperor=====\nAboard the ''Chimaera'', Ezra was taken in binders to face Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn stated Ezra's decision to surrender as a sign that he had chosen the Jedi way of making moral choices over strategic decisions. After talking about the recent history of the Jedi, Ezra and Thrawn argued about the Force. While Thrawn regarded the Force as a weapon that the Jedi did not know how to wield, Ezra disagreed.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nBelieving that Lothal was doomed, Thrawn showed Ezra his art collection including Sabine Wren's graffiti. While Ezra believed that Thrawn had no right to steal other people's culture and art, Thrawn countered that the young Jedi did not understand the significance of power. He then brought Ezra to a special chamber inside the ''Chimaera'' that contained a rebuilt portion of the Lothal Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nAppearing remotely via [[hologram]], [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] tried to convince Ezra as his younger friendly Chancellor counterpart to unlock the portal to the World Between Worlds by offering the chance to reunite with his deceased parents. Despite Ezra's desire to reunite with his family, he saw through the Emperor's disguise and manipulation and used the Force to tear down the structure.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nUnder the Emperor's orders, three [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Royal Guards]] and stormtroopers attempted to kill Ezra. However, the Jedi Padawan used the Force to summon debris and crush them. Meanwhile, Ezra's rebel comrades managed to restart the Dome's shields, protecting Capital City from Thrawn's second bombardment wave.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\n=====Into the unknown=====\nShortly later, Ezra's rebel comrades Wolffe, Mart Mattin, and Cikatro Vizago managed to summon a pod of purrgil to aid the rebels. The purrgil wiped out much of Thrawn's fleet above Lothal and converged around the ''Chimaera''. Ezra had tasked Mart with summoning the purrgil as part of his contingency plan against Thrawn's Imperial fleet. As the purrgil attack, Ezra stormed the bridge of the ''Chimaera'' and disarmed two of Thrawn's stormtroopers.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nAs the purrgil latched onto the ''Chimaera'', Thrawn warned that whatever happened to them next would happen to both of them, a sentiment shared by Ezra. As purrgil tentacles grabbed Thrawn and the stormtroopers on the bridge, Ezra confirmed to Sabine that the purrgil were part of his plan. When more stormtroopers entered the bridge, Ezra used the Force to force them back and lock the blast doors. Thrawn also managed to shoot Ezra but the boy hurled him against a viewport with the Force.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nAs the purrgil prepared to jump into hyperspace, Hera ordered Ezra to leave but he insisted on seeing this through in order to remove Thrawn from Lothal. Before leaving, Ezra told his rebel comrades that it was up to them and that the Force would always be with them. The creatures then carried the ''Chimaera''\u2014along with Ezra and Thrawn\u2014into hyperspace,<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" /> though both survived<ref name=\"Thrawn & Ezra Survival\">{{SWYoutube|uR8Sn_2VRBA|Rebels Recon #4.8: Inside \"A Fool's Hope\" & \"Family Reunion - and Farewell\" &#124; ''Star Wars Rebels''|archivedate=20200227160858}}</ref> the trip to deep space.<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars New\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nFollowing Ezra's departure, the rebels destroyed the Dome, wiping out the Imperial garrison on Lothal. With the planet free of Imperial rule, Ezra's fellow Spectres considered rescuing him. However, Ezra had left a pre-recorded hologram message with Chopper in which he explained his decision to choose a difficult path. He gave Zeb the top bunk, told Hera he had left a meiloorun fruit for her, and reminded Sabine he was counting on her. Ezra also thanked Hera, Sabine, Chopper, and Zeb for being the best family to him. Due to Ezra's leadership and actions, Lothal was liberated from Imperial rule. Sabine honored Ezra's request that they protect his homeworld. Despite initial fears by the rebels, the Empire never returned to Lothal to retake it.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nIn [[4 ABY]], shortly before the [[Battle of Endor]], C-3PO told the [[Ewok]]s on [[Endor]] the story of how a boy was able to spark the rebellion with a message broadcast across the worlds.<ref name=\"beware\">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> A mural of Ezra and the other Spectres, flanked by loth-wolves, was painted on Lothal. In honor of Ezra's friendship and service, Sabine and Tano [[Search for Ezra|departed on a quest]] to bring him home.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nAt some point after the [[First Order]]'s arrival on [[Batuu]] in [[34 ABY]],<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge date\">{{Galaxy's Edge Date}}</ref> an individual wearing Mandalorian armor and a [[Nite Owl helmet]] similar to Sabine's called [[Krownest (individual)|Krownest]] contacted [[Dok-Ondar]] to inquire about Ezra's old scout trooper helmet. Ondar replied that he had the helmet, and stated that it belonged to a rebel from long ago. Krownest confirmed it was the helmet they were looking for and made arrangements to send credits and a shipping address to purchase Ezra's helmet.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Datapad\">[[Star Wars: Datapad|''Star Wars'': Datapad]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Before I met Kanan, I only ever thought of myself, but Kanan and the rest, they don't think like that.

Bridger grew up on his own and worked as a small-time thief and con artist, using his street smarts to steal technology and goods from the forces of the Galactic Empire, though he felt no loyalty to others.<ref name=\"Meet Ezra\" /> By [[2 BBY]], Ezra had adopted a shorter hairstyle with short back and sides.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nInitially, Ezra only saw the crew of the ''Ghost'' as a means to an end, stealing any valuables from the ship he could find, but he soon befriended and developed a strong bond with the crew members.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" /> Ezra's rough upbringing taught him not to trust others, let alone help them. He learned to survive by depending on himself, which he acknowledged made him selfish. After meeting the crew of the ''Ghost'', his jokey attitude hid from the others what he really felt about his parents, but Ezra eventually became more trusting and realized that he wanted to help others. Ezra was also very charismatic, which helped him get by during his early years. He was thievish, yet easy going and upbeat, and liked to play pranks and make jokes. He flirted with Sabine and developed a friendly rivalry with her. He often pranked and messed around with Zeb.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" />\n\nDuring the mission to Malachor, Ezra encountered the former Sith apprentice, Maul, who taught him the basic philosophy of the Sith and encouraged Bridger to use his anger to strengthen him.<ref name=\"Twilight\" /> After the loss of Ahsoka Tano and the blinding of his master, Ezra was determined to never allow his friends to be harmed again. Due to this and influence from the Sith holocron, Bridger started to fight more aggressively, such as killing stormtroopers rather than stunning them. Bridger's use of the Sith holocron strained relations with his master Kanan. In addition, Bridger was a headstrong young man who was willing to circumvent orders. Ezra began to repair his relationship with Kanan after his master rescued him during a dangerous mission at Reklam Station.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nEzra also sought to discover the key to destroying the Sith.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" /> Despite being tempted by the dark side and Maul, Ezra ultimately chose to remain loyal to his master Kanan and friend Sabine. His selflessness put him at odds with Maul, who failed to understand Ezra's loyalty to his friends.<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" /> Ezra also had a great deal of respect for the lives of other sentient beings. This led him to object to Saw Gerrera's harsh treatment of the Geonosian Klik-Klak and his threat to destroy the last Geonosian queen egg. Ezra also had a friendly and kind demeanor which allowed him to gain Klik-Klak's trust.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nEzra was a loyal and sympathetic friend to Sabine Wren. While Sabine was training to wield the Darksaber, he patiently taught her lightsaber strokes. When Sabine wanted to give up, Ezra urged her to persevere and reassured her that Kanan meant well. As he matured, Ezra was able to impart wisdom to his peers. When Sabine told him about her estranged relationship with her family who had supported the Empire, Ezra counselled her that at least she had a family to return to unlike himself.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" /> Ezra also had some skill with manipulating his voice to mimic other individuals. On one occasion, he used this to impersonate the Trandoshan Mining Guild captain Seevor in an attempt to allay the suspicions of the Mining Guild authorities.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\" />\n\nEzra was a good actor and was able to pretend to be a bounty hunter during a mission to rescue Kallus. During the course of that mission, he learned to trust the rogue ISB agent and rebel sympathizer with keeping Chopper Base a secret.<ref name=\"TIE\" /> Due to his youth, Ezra at times could be impulsive. His emotional concern for Kenobi also made him susceptible to the Dark Sider Maul's machinations. Ezra's belief that Kenobi held the key to destroying the Sith led him to embark on an errant mission to find Kenobi. Ezra soon found that Kenobi was more than capable of fending for himself and that his real place was with his adoptive rebel family.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\nAs he grew older, Ezra came to appreciate his master Kanan for teaching him to be a better person. Ezra's devotion to the rebel cause motivated him not to give up when it seemed impossible to solicit reinforcements for the besieged rebel forces at Atollon. His courage and devotion won him the admiration and respect of Mon Mothma and Ursa Wren. Ezra was despondent about the rebel defeat at Atollon but Kanan reassured him that they were still alive to fight another day.<ref name=\"Zero Hour\" />\n\nWhile Ezra admired Saw Gerrera for yielding results, he became disillusioned with the Partisan leader's aggressive tactics and reckless disregard for the lives of non-combatants.<ref name=\"In the Name\" /> Ezra was distraught to learn about his friend Old Jho's death and was visibly angered when Baron Rudor mocked Jho.<ref name=\"The Occupation\" /> Like Sabine, Ezra was willing to undertake risky and dangerous actions in service of the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\n[[File:EzraBridgerWantedPoster-SWCT.png|thumb|right|220px|Bridger's Imperial wanted poster]]\nEzra's sense of comradeship led him to lead a mission to rescue his rebel cell's leader Hera Syndulla.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" /> Ezra and his fellow Spectres were devastated by the loss of their co-leader Kanan, who was a mentor and teacher to Ezra. Ezra was lost and frightened during his master's death.<ref name=\"DUME\" /> After encountering a white loth-wolf named \"Dume\" who carried Kanan's conscience,<ref name=\"AWBW\" /> Ezra regained his confidence and led a mission to save the Lothal Jedi Temple from the Empire.<ref name=\"Wolves and a Door\" />\n\nEzra's respect for Ahsoka Tano led him to save her from death by pulling her into the mystical World Between Worlds. Ezra gained Tano's respect for saving her life. In return, Tano promised to find him when she returned to her time. Despite missing his master, Ezra realized under Tano's tutelage that Kanan had died to save the lives of him and his rebel comrades. As a result, Ezra made peace with Kanan's sacrifice. To prevent the Emperor from entering the World Between Worlds, Ezra and his rebel comrades sealed the portal; thus denying the Emperor's ambitions of controlling time and the universe.<ref name=\"AWBW\" />\n\nEzra was a cunning and skilled military commander who was able to utilize the Lothal rebels' limited resources to their best advantage. Recognizing that the rebels lacked an army that could take Capital City, he instead devised a plot that involved luring Governor Pryce to the Lothal rebel camp so that they could take her prisoner. As a commander, Ezra was not one to take the glory for himself but instead thanked his comrades for helping them to achieve victory. Ezra's primary goal as rebel leader was to show the galaxy that the Empire could be defeated and driven from Lothal.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\nWorking with Hera, Rex, Kallus, and Ryder Azadi, Ezra helped lead a successful operation to capture the Dome's command center and initiate Protocol 13. In line with the Jedi philosophy of not letting innocents suffer, Ezra willingly surrendered himself to Thrawn to save the people of Capital City. Unlike Thrawn, Ezra believed that the Force was not a weapon and disagreed with Thrawn's idea that the Jedi did not know how to wield power.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\nWhile Ezra was tempted by the Emperor's offer of reuniting with his family, Ezra realized that the Emperor was trying to manipulate him. Ezra was also willing to sacrifice himself to see that the purrgil took Thrawn and his fleet away from Lothal. Regarding the Spectres as his family, Ezra entrusted them with protecting his homeworld in his absence.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Force abilities===\n{{Quote|Come on.

He was able to perform Force-enhanced jumps even without proper training,<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" /><ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" /><ref name=\"Fighter Flight\" /> and could sense things through the Force, such as when he sensed Kanan Jarrus's presence for the first time, or when he was drawn to the former Jedi's lightsaber and holocron.<ref name=\"Spark of Rebellion\" /> When Valen Rudor tried to kill him with his TIE fighter's laser cannons from behind, Bridger sensed the danger and dodged the shot.<ref name=\"Property\" /> He also had an affinity in the use of [[telekinesis]], such as when he instinctively [[Force push|pushed]] Agent Kallus several feet away to save Zeb.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\" /> Ezra and his master, Kanan Jarrus soon developed a tactic of combining his use of the Force, especially Force push, with that of Kanan. This notably allowed them to send Darth Vader himself flying into the path of a collapsing walker with their combined Force powers, though the Sith Lord had not been paying them any attention at the time.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" />\n\nUnder Jarrus' training, Bridger's Force abilities became more refined. He learned how to [[Taming beasts|tame]] a horde of fyrnocks; on the same day, however, he made a connection to the dark side and this power was amplified to the point of being able to summon a giant fyrnock, though he quickly collapsed from the unprepared exposure to the malevolent power.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\" /> Bridger was also known to have Force visions.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\" /> After building his own lightsaber, Bridger initially struggled in learning how to use [[Form V]], but later proved to have enough proficiency to deflect blaster fire.<ref name=\"Vision of Hope\" /> During a mission to Takobo, Ezra was able to use his Force connection to calm the wailing Ithorian infant Pypey.<ref name=\"Future of the Force\" /> On a latter occasion, he also managed to communicate with the Purrgil King and convince them to help the Spectres. Later, he used a Jedi mind trick to force the Imperial commander of a fighter carrier to order an evacuation of his ship.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" /> Ezra also used a Jedi mind trick to convince a stormtrooper that he was Lieutenant Lyste.<ref name=\"TIE\" /> After training with the Sith holocron, Ezra learned to completely control a person's mind rather than influence them such as when he forced an Imperial walker pilot to turn on his comrades and commit suicide.<ref name=\"Steps\" />\n\nEzra was also able to Force jump for long distances. On one occasion, he jumped out of a descending Imperial Troop Transport and jumped over two other transports as they were falling down a gorge. Ezra missed the cliff and was only saved from death by Sabine.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" /> Due to this Force powers, Ezra was able to perceive and interact with the loth-wolf, a mythical Lothalian creature long believed to be extinct.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" /> Despite his Force&ndash;enhanced fighting abilities, Ezra found the Noghri tracker Rukh to be a difficult opponent to subdue. Still, Ezra managed use his ingenuity to escape Rukh while recovering a hyperdrive unit on Lothal.<ref name=\"Kindred\" />\n\nBridger's Force powers gave him an advantage in unarmed combat even against formidable opponents such as the Trandoshan Seevor. While no match for Seevor's agility and strength, Ezra managed to use the Force to cause Seevor to trip and fall to his death inside a smelter.<ref name=\"Crawler Commandeers\" />\n\nEzra was proficient enough to summon the Force to crush several Royal Guards and stormtroopers with debris from a portion of the Lothal Jedi Temple. In addition, Ezra was able to use the Force to command a pod of purrgil to carry him, Thrawn, and the ''Chimaera'' away from Lothal.<ref name=\"Family Reunion\" />\n\n===Lightsaber skills===\n{{Quote|I feel as if his abilities are growing faster than I can teach him.|Kanan Jarrus|Path of the Jedi}}\n[[File:SWD12_preview3.png|thumb|right|250px|Ezra's skill with the Force and the lightsaber grew under Kanan Jarrus' teaching.]]\nAs Ezra's Jedi training continued under Kanan, his lightsaber skills improved over time. Due to his role in the rebellion, Ezra had several opportunities to put his lightsaber skills into action. During an escape from an Imperial Interdictor, Ezra used his lightsaber to deflect blaster bolts and clear a hallway for escape.<ref name=\"Stealth Strike\" /> By the following year, Ezra had begun to study [[Form IV]] through a recording of the former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker found in Kanan's holocron, and he could briefly engage the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister in a duel alongside Kanan.<ref name=\"Shroud of Darkness\" /> By the time the rebellion had discovered Atollon, Ezra was able to fight his master Kanan to a draw in a training exercise.<ref name=\"Mystery\" /> Ezra was ultimately no match for Darth Vader.<ref name=\"Siege of Lothal\" /> He lasted only seconds in a lightsaber duel with the Sith Lord before having his lightsaber destroyed.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nFollowing the mission to Malachor, Ezra adopted his master's style of fighting, using a blaster in conjunction with his new lightsaber. After training with the Sith holocron, Ezra's fighting style became more brutal and aggressive.<ref name=\"Steps\" /> Ezra ended his brief dabbling with the dark side after a meeting with the mysterious entity known as Bendu.<ref name=\"Holocrons\" /> During the skirmish on Dathomir, Ezra wielded the darksaber alongside his own lightsaber to destroy the altar of the Nightsister spirits, thus showing some skill in [[Jar'Kai]].<ref name=\"Visions and Voices\" /> As Ezra's Jedi training and skills improved, he was able to impart his knowledge to Sabine. Ezra proved to be a patient teacher and taught Sabine to practice with stick fighting as a preparation for wielding the Darksaber.<ref name=\"Trials of the Darksaber\" /> By the time his allies and he liberated Lothal, Ezra demonstrated skill in engaging foes equipped with an Electrostaff, where he managed to repel Rukh.<ref name=\"A Fool's Hope\" />\n\n===Other abilities===\nAfter multiple training exercises with Hera, Ezra had grown enough as a pilot to lead Jon Vander in disabling the TIE Defender piloted by Vult Skerris. Ezra was also a competent gunner and managed to shoot down a tactical infiltration pod.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" /> Due to his compassion and understanding of others, Ezra often served as the unofficial diplomat of the [[Spectres|Ghost crew]] on many occasions.<ref name=\"Ghosts\" />\n\nEzra also learned how to operate a jetpack but struggled to master the machine. Despite his limited mastery of the jetpack, Ezra managed to use one to fire a rocket at a TIE fighter.<ref name=\"Heroes of Mandalore\" /> Ezra was able to pilot a range of starships including an RZ-1T trainer<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" /> and a TIE/D Defender Elite. Ezra's piloting skills enabled him to shoot down three TIE/IN Interceptors during a mission on Lothal, though he did so from the cockpit of a vastly superior TIE/D Defender Elite.<ref name=\"Flight of the Defender\" />\n\nEzra was also a builder and guided his fellow Spectres as they built Loth-bat gliders for their mission to rescue Hera.<ref name=\"Jedi Night\" /> Ezra was able to use his natural connection to the Force to communicate and summon wolves.<ref name=\"Wolves and a Door\" /> Under Sabine's tutelage, Ezra learned how to decipher and activate the Painting of the Mortis gods, a portal to the World Between Worlds. As a result, Ezra was able to both lock and unlock the portal to the mystical dimension.<ref name=\"AWBW\" />\n\nAs a military commander, Ezra was able to work with other people.
