Narkal was noted for his talkativeness, which wound up fellow hunters [[Ugzak]] and [[Gurke]]. Both of the other Gamorreans thought of Narkal as stupid, and frequently told him to shut up. The three Gamorreans ambushed [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] in the wastes and were possibly killed by Revan.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRevan also had an opportunity to kill him and his group in the lodge. They could also be bribed not to kill Revan. If they are not talked to after the ambush, in the lodge, he will not die.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Narkal\n|fi=Narkal\n|pl=Narkal\n|ru=\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
