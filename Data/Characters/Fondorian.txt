Low-caste Fondorians traditionally had only one name, their family name. The [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] [[Zsinj]] inherited such a trait from his [[Zsinj's father|Fondorian father]], a [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyard]] [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]]. Social mobility was possible for low-caste Fondorians, however: before defecting to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]], [[Hosh Hune]] received an apprenticeship in the [[Fondor Guild of Starshipwrights]] as a reward for his family's generations of service to the guild.\n\nUpper-caste Fondorians were extremely intelligent and regal beings who believed themselves smarter than any other [[Species/Legends|species]] in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. They were very sharp thinkers and were able to manipulate business deals to suit them, and for this reason, Fondor was one of the wealthiest [[Planet/Legends|planets]] in the galaxy. One Fondorian was the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] defector, [[Oolth]]. Author [[Metrisse]] was Fondorian as well.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Cloak of Deception]]''\n*[[Darth Maul (2000) 3|''Darth Maul'' (2000) 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2000) 4|''Darth Maul'' (2000) 4]]\n*''[[Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Adventures 1: Hunt the Sun Runner]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Adventures 2: The Cavern of Screaming Skulls]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Adventures 3: The Hostage Princess]]''\n*''[[Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook|''Star Wars: Edge of the Empire'' Core Rulebook]]\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n\n[[File:Fondor_people.png|thumb|left|180px|Fondor administrator and zero-[[Gravity/Legends|gravity]] ship worker]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fondorianer\n|es=Fondoriano\n|hu=Fondori\n|ja=\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\n|ru=\u0424\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Colonies species]]\n[[Category:Fondorians| ]]\n[[Category:Human and Near-Human species]]"}}}]}}}}
