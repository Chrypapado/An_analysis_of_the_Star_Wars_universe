Along with four other Masters, Evrios joined Master [[Jorus C'baoth]] aboard ''[[Outbound Flight]] ''as part of the experimental [[Outbound Flight Project]] in [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], Evrios had attained the rank of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] by the beginning of the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]] which plagued the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in its final decade. Evrios was one of five Jedi Masters who fell under the persuasive sway of Master [[Jorus C'baoth]], joining him in support of the radical [[Outbound Flight Project]]. In addition to the five Masters, twelve Jedi Knights also backed C'baoth's project. The powerfully influential Jedi, after much lobbying and mediation to bolster his standing and prestige among members of the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], was finally able to secure [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] approval for ''Outbound Flight''{{'s}} maiden voyage; the massive 6-Dreadnought leviathan, built around a central storage core, was set to depart [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] in [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]].<ref name=\"OBF\" />\n\nAssigned to oversee ''[[Dreadnaught-Two]]'', Evrios had no qualms when Master C'baoth ordered the Jedi to begin sifting through the [[Starship/Legends|ship's]] passengers, whose children had been previously screened for Force-sensitivity. The children so marked as potential [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi Initiates]] were, by C'baoth's order, to be taken, conscripted, and indoctrinated to on-board Jedi training, with or without parental consent.\n\nBut when the titanic starship was intercepted by the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]], all six dreadnaughts were destroyed in the ensuing [[Battle of Outbound Flight|battle]], resulting tragically not only in Master Evrios' death but the deaths of most of the other passengers as well.<ref name=\"OBF\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']] {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Evrios\n|fi=Evrios\n}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Masters]]"}}}]}}}}
