Serving the Alliance aboard [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]]-made [[interdictor]]s throughout the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Patrell was elevated to the rank of [[Captain/Legends|captain]] and when the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] came to power, placed in command of the ''[[Wait a Minute]]'', a [[CC-7700/E interdiction cruiser]] that was part of the [[Rapid Response Task Force]]. Patrell brought with him thirty-five years of service and was considered a veteran of warfare by his peers and colleagues.<ref name=\"LSSM\" />\n\nIn [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]], Patrell was wary of the Republic's plans to attack Imperial [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Cronal|Shadowspan's]] headquarters on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Mindor/Legends|Mindor]] in part because of the planet's natural defense in the form of the [[Big Crush]]. A field of debris and wreckage left over from a failed Imperial experiment, the Big Crush would be perilous and costly to cross by the calculation of Patrell and his officers. None the less, Patrell would be commanded to participate in the [[Battle of Mindor]] and were relieved to be reinforced by [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] when the opening of the battle went sour. When the Imperials unveiled their gravity weapons, Patrell and his men were thrown off balance until Calrissian suggested using their [[Gravity well projector/Legends|gravity well projectors]] to deflect the Imperial arsenal away from Republic ships. While this tactic caused mass damage to the surface of Mindor and the destruction of the ''[[Hold 'Em]]'', Shadowspawn's forces recovered and ordered several waves of [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE Interceptors]] to drive at full velocity into the hull of the ''Wait a Minute''. As the ship broke apart from the devastating assault, Patrell and all aboard the ship perished.<ref name=\"LSSM\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Patrell\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Patrell, Jav}}\n[[Category:Alliance Fleet personnel]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Defense Fleet captains]]"}}}]}}}}
