She was the last of the group to join the battle with the Imperial security around the Hammertong facility, but she subsequently provided an escort to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] for the [[Strike-class medium cruiser|Strike Cruiser]] which [[Shada D'ukal]] and [[Karoly D'ulin]] had stolen.\n\nOn Tatooine, Cai remained with the ships while Shada and Karoly traveled into [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] to find a transport for the [[Superlaser/Legends|superlaser]] prototype which the cruiser had been carrying. She subsequently flew the ''Mirage'' out of Tatooine alongside the freighter which they had acquired from [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] agent [[Riij Winward]], although Winward 'borrowed' Deefour to ensure that the Hammertong's technical readouts reached the Alliance.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Hammertong: The Tale of the \"Tonnika Sisters\"]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Cai\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mistryl]]"}}}]}}}}
