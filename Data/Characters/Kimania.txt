[[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"date\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is dated to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' depicted the disappearance of the Cularin system and its reappearance ten years later, thus moving the setting of the campaign forward by ten years, and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]]. Within ''Hunting the Wyrd'' it has stated that Kimania had led the [[Rinajaa irstat]] for twelve years as of the time of her death; assuming that this period does not include  the ten years in which the Cularin system was absent from the galaxy, it can therefore be concluded that Kimania became leader of the [[irstat]] 22 calendar years before the events of ''Hunting the Wyrd'', in around [[42 BBY/Legends|42 BBY]].</ref> [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]]<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\">''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]''</ref>\n|species=[[Tarasin]]<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n|gender=[[Gender/Legends|Female]]<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n|height=\n|mass=\n|hair=\n|eyes=\n|skin=\n|cyber=\n|affiliation=[[Rinajaa irstat]]<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n|masters=\n|apprentices=}}\n[[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]] '''Kimania''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Tarasin]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], serving as the leader of the [[Rinajaa irstat]] tribe. Around [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], Kimania was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during an assault on the Rinajaa irstat by the [[Wyrd]], a belligerent group of Tarasin [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Witch/Legends|witches]]. Following the attack, Kimania's hut in the village of the Rinajaa was [[Fire/Legends|burned]] to honor her passing and she briefly manifested as a [[Force ghost|ghost]] within the blazing structure.\n\n==Biography==\nKimania was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] Tarasin who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] during the last [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" /> Around [[42 BBY/Legends|42 BBY]],<ref name=\"date\" /> Kimania became the [[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]],<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" /> or spiritual leader,<ref name-\"LFCG\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref> of the [[Rinajaa irstat]], a Tarasin [[Irstat|tribe]] that resided at village in the Cularin [[Jungle/Legends|jungles]]. She dwelled within a hut in the Rinajaa settlement and subsequently led the irstat for twelve [[Standard year/Legends|years]], reaching an old age.<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n\nCirca [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"date\" /> the village of the Rinajaa irstat was struck in a surprise nighttime raid by the [[Wyrd]], a [[Coven/Legends|coven]] of Tarasin [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Witch/Legends|witches]] hostile to other Tarasin groups. Kimania observed as the witches [[Death/Legends|killed]] several of the villagers and was then herself murdered by a Wyrd witch, who [[Telekinesis/Legends|snapped]] Kimania's [[throat]] with the Force. The Wyrd attackers then floated the deceased matriarch's corpse into the [[Atmosphere/Legends|air]] and held Kimania's body up above a group of captive Rinajaa villagers to serve as a warning of the fate that would befall any who defied the witches.<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n\n{{RPG|''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]''}}\nThe [[heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents assigned to combat the Wyrd, arrived at the Rinajaa village and liberated the villagers from their Wyrd oppressors. Around two hours after the operatives arrival, the surviving Rinajaa Tarasin placed Kimania's body into the hut that had been her home. They then forced several captive Wyrd witches into the structure as well, planning to set the hut [[Fire/Legends|alight]] with the Wyrd sisters inside so as to honor Kimania and avenge her demise. However, heroes of Cularin persuaded the villagers to spare the witches. As Kimania's hut was at aflame, she briefly appeared within the burning structure as [[Force ghost]] and smiled and nodded at the operatives to acknowledge their saving of the prisoners, before fading from view.<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nFollowing her death and transformation into a Force ghost, Kimania opposed the killing of the Wyrd witches that had harried her village. At the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the Wyrd attack on the Rinajaa irstat she wore simple [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]].<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKimania featured in ''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]'', a [[2004]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] adventure by [[Lee Pickler]] set within [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity which formed part of [[RPGA]]'s [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign. In the adventure, the player characters roleplay as the freelance agents that free the Rinajaa irstat from the Wyrd and the players can decide whether to prevent the Rinajaa villagers from torching the captive Wyrd witches. If the player characters intervene to save the prisoners, Kimania appears as a ghost as her hut burns and smiles and nods at the player characters. If the players allow the witches to be incinerated, Kimania's ghost manifests within the blazing hut displaying a deeply saddened demeanor and shakes her head at the freelance agents to lament their failure to save the prisoners.<ref name=\"Hunting The Wyrd\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]'' {{1st}} {{Ghost}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force ghosts]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]"}}}]}}}}
