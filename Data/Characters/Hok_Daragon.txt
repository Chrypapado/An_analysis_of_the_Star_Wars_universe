He was the [[Marriage/Legends|husband]] of [[Timar Daragon]] and the father of [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] and [[Jori Daragon]]. During the [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|Unification Wars]] of the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]], Daragon worked as a supply runner with his wife in their ship, the ''[[Shadow Runner]]''. On one mission to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Kirrek]] in [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]] during the midst of [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|a battle]], the ''Shadow Runner'' was destroyed by [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] forces, [[Death/Legends|killing]] both of the Daragons instantly. After their deaths, the Daragons' other ship, the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', was bequeathed to Gav and Jori, who would become [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] explorers.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|This is going to be tough.|Hok Daragon, during his mission to Kirrek|Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 0}}\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Hok Daragon was [[Marriage/Legends|married]] to [[Timar Daragon]], and had two children, [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] and [[Jori Daragon]]. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]] during the [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|Unification Wars]] in the [[Empress Teta/Legends|Koros system]], where a political leader named [[Teta/Legends|Teta]] attempted to unify the seven [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] of the Koros [[Star system/Legends|system]], the Daragons worked as supply runners to Teta's forces in their [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the ''[[Shadow Runner]]''. In time, Teta's forces managed to unify six of the Koros system's seven worlds in mutual commerce and aid. The only planet in the system yet to be unified with the others was [[Kirrek]], where the Tetan soldiers had become besieged by rebels and [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]]. The Daragons went to [[Aarrba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], who ran a [[Aarrba's Repair Dock|service dock]] in the Koros system [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]], to repair the ''Shadow Runner'' so they could bring relief supplies to the soldiers on Kirrek.<ref name=\"totj\" />\n\nThe Daragons were grateful for Aarrba's services, and in exchange, the Hutt decided to keep the Daragon's other ship, the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', as collateral until they returned. Gav and Jori asked Hok and Timar if they could assist them on their mission but were refused, as Hok believed that their upcoming mission was too dangerous.<ref name=\"totj\" /> Meanwhile on Kirrek, the [[Battle of Kirrek (Unification Wars)|battle]] continued, with the Tetan forces now led by two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], [[Memit Nadill]] and [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]]. Using an exotic [[Force power/Legends|Force power]] known as [[battle meditation]], the Jedi were able to demoralize the pirate forces and lift the spirits of the Tetan fighters. Finding their backs against the wall, the pirates desperately began to fire on the weakest targets, hoping to eliminate as many as they could before they were defeated. The ''Shadow Runner'' reached Kirrek soon afterward, and was quickly attacked by the pirate guns.<ref name=\"nec\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\nThe Daragons decided to fly in low and fast to drop their cargo, but weren't able to maneuver the ''Shadow Runner'' well enough due to the heavy load. Caught in a crossfire, the ''Shadow Runner'' was destroyed, [[Death/Legends|killing]] both of the Daragons instantly. The Tetan forces ultimately won the battle, unifying the entire Koros system. After the Daragons' death, Aarrba gave Gav and Jori the ''Starbreaker 12'', and the two vowed to honor their parents by exploring the galaxy.<ref name=\"totj\" />\nThis would prove to be a pivotal moment in [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Timeline of galactic history/Legends|history]]; Gav and Jori would eventually take a blind [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] jump and discover the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], sparking the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]].<ref name=\"nec\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nHok Daragon was a daring individual; he accepted a dangerous mission to Kirrek, knowing full well that the mission was perilous and could end in his death. When confronted with the pirate guns, Daragon took it as a challenge, but panicked once the ''Shadow Runner'' was hit and began to crash. Daragon greatly cared for his children Gav and Jori and was mindful of their safety, refusing to allow them along on the mission to Kirrek due to his concerns that it was too dangerous for them. Daragon and his wife were both considered skilled [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] by their children.<ref name=\"totj\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHok Daragon made his first and only appearance in [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 0|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 0]].
