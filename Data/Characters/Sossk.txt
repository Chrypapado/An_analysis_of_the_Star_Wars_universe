He purchased and ran the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] [[Krakin's Alehouse]] and by the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], he had owned if for about fifteen years. He spoke with a lisp and he had no plans to develop his cantina, so he allowed the dust to build up and played music from old speakers. However, he liked having people in his bar, although he never smiled.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20051006rememberwhen|text=Remember When|int=Remember When|archivedate=20090603045535}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Trandoshans]]"}}}]}}}}
