Despite being barely older than Jens, Jahan followed them deep into the bowels of Coruscant, killing several thugs, but was several hours too late to save his sister. The death of his beloved sister haunted Jahan during the rest of his adult life.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 2]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 3]]'' {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Iron Eclipse 4]]'' {{Flash}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Jens Cross\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441 \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cross, Jens}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
