Keto had a daughter named [[Aleema Keto]] who, along with Lord Keto's son [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]], was the heir to the [[Tetan Monarchy|Tetan throne]]. The Ketos were forced to share their dominion over the [[Star system/Legends|system]] with the commercial interests that controlled [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] [[Mining/Legends|mines]] in the Empress Teta system. Eventually, Satal and Aleema Keto, filled with anger and resentment and possessing much free time, learned the secrets of [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Sith magic]] and formed an organization known as the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]], determined to wrest control of the system from their parents.

Keto and her brother were descendants of [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] [[Teta/Legends|Teta]], the famous woman warrior who [[Unification Wars (Koros)/Legends|unified]] the seven [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] of the then-Koros [[Star system/Legends|system]] [[5000 BBY/Legends|a thousand years previous]]. The Empress Teta system was a major source of raw [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]], and the Ketos were forced to share their power with the commercial interests that ran carbonite [[Mining/Legends|mines]] in the system. Eventually, Magda had a daughter named [[Aleema Keto|Aleema]]. Along with Lord Keto's son, [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]], Aleema was the heir to the [[Tetan Monarchy|Tetan throne]]. The younger Ketos, filled with anger and resentment toward their elders and with much free time on their hands, formed a [[darksider]] organization called the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]], and learned to wield [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Sith magic]]. The Krath launched a [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|rebellion]] in [[3997 BBY]], while Magda and Lord Keto were on an inspection tour of an [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] [[Tetan carbonite smelter]] over the planet [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]].<ref name=\"darklords1\" />\n\nMagda Keto and her brother met with [[Bearus]], the [[Chairman/Legends|chairman]] of the [[Carbonite Guild]]. As they exchanged pleasantries, Aleema and Satal, along with their royal tutor [[Korus]], arrived in a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]]. There, Satal and Aleema revealed that they had turned Korus' tongue into an [[Adegan eel]] with Sith magic, and attacked Magda Keto, her brother, and the mining executives. Lord Keto ordered his [[Royal Protector]]s to apprehend Satal and Aleema, to Magda's horror; she was outraged that her brother would arrest their own children, but Keto responded that he had no choice. However, Aleema's Sith [[Mind trick/Legends#Illusion|illusions]] overpowered the Royal Protectors, leaving Magda Keto and her brother defenseless. They were led by Satal and Aleema toward a vat of molten carbonite, where they were [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|frozen]], [[Death/Legends|killing]] them. The frozen bodies of Magda and Lord Keto went on display as wall decorations in their former palace, the [[Iron Citadel/Legends|Iron Citadel]].<ref name=\"darklords1\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Lord Keto!
