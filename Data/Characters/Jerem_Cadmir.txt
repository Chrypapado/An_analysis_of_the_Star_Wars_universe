Cadmir, on what little [[Oxygen/Legends|oxygen]] he had left, attempted to get back to the ExGal-4 compound, but was confronted and killed by Yomin Carr, who broke his neck and felt he had shown a great amount of respect by killing him honorably.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jerem Cadmir\n|es=Jerem Cadmir\n|pl=Jerem Cadmir\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cadmir, Jerem}}\n[[Category:Astronomers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Extragalactic Society members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
