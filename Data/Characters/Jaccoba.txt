In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Jaccoba accompanied his father, [[Tarkov]], on a [[grantaloupe]] [[Hunting/Legends|hunt]], during which the pair discovered a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] invasion [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|army]] on Kashyyyk. Both Wookiees reported the Separatist presence to the nearby towns of [[Warralokk/Legends|Warralokk]], [[Grunnrurr/Legends|Grunnrurr]], and [[Rowrakruk/Legends|Rowrakruk]]. Later, when the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] sent a detachment of [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|their army]] to reinforce the Wookiees' defense of Kashyyyk, Jaccoba and Tarkov fought alongside the Republic's forces to [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|defend]] Kachirho from the Separatists.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Tarkov_Sees_Sep_Army.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaccoba and Tarkov see the Confederate army.]]\nJaccoba was a young [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] native to the [[Wawaatt Archipelago/Legends|Wawaatt Archipelago]] near the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Kachirho/Legends|Kachirho]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]].<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], during the height of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]],<ref name=\"CW22\" /> Jaccoba and his father, [[Tarkov]], went on a [[Hunting/Legends|hunt]] for the four-legged herbivorous [[grantaloupe]], which would elevate Jaccoba to adulthood.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> During their hunt, Jaccoba threw a [[Spear/Legends|spear]] that missed his grantaloupe target but hit a large piece of shrubbery, creating a loud metallic echo. Tarkov scrutinized the shubbery, trying to figure out why a [[Plant/Legends|plant]] would be making a metallic sound, and discovered that the \"plant\" was actually a Separatist [[C-9979 landing craft/Legends|landing craft]]. Jaccoba and Tarkov moved to a nearby tree for safety, and as they looked down at the landscape, they saw a large Confederate invasion [[Separatist Droid Army/Legends|army]].<ref name=\"CW22\" />\n\nThe two went to the city of [[Kahiyuk/Legends|Kahiyuk]] and alerted the nearby towns of [[Warralokk/Legends|Warralokk]], [[Grunnrurr/Legends|Grunnrurr]], and [[Rowrakruk/Legends|Rowrakruk]] to the approaching Separatist army. Soon after Jaccoba and Tarkov's discovery, the Republic sent a detachment of [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|their army]], under the command of [[High Jedi General/Legends|High Jedi General]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]], to help protect Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"db\" /> The two enlisted in the local military and were among the Wookiees who fought alongside the Republic army to repel the Confederacy's subsequent [[Battle of Kashyyyk/Legends|attack]] on Kachirho.<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJaccoba cared about Kashyyyk, wanting to warn the rest of the planet about the Confederate presence when he first discovered the approaching invasion army. He also was, along with his father, determined enough to defend Kachirho from the Separatist invaders.<ref name=\"db\" /> Jaccoba had [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and his body was covered in ginger [[Hair/Legends|hair]].<ref name=\"CW22\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJaccoba first appeared as an unidentified Wookiee in the [[Clone Wars Chapter 22|twenty-second chapter]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' animated television series. The chapter first aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on [[March 22]], [[2005]] and was the second episode in the series' [[Clone Wars: Season Three|third season]]. Jaccoba's name was revealed in the audio commentary for Chapter 22 on the [[Star Wars: Clone Wars Volume Two|''Star Wars: Clone Wars'' Volume Two]] [[Star Wars home video releases|DVD]].
