She was killed by the future [[Hunter (individual)|Grand Champion of the Great Hunt]] on [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nTrying to get his competitor killed, [[Tarro Blood]] convinced Vye and her brother, Vorr, that the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] who killed Vexx shot him in the back and then murdered [[Braden]]. Along with Vorr, Vye confronted the hunter in the [[Sobrik]] [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]]. In the ensuing firefight, the hunter proved better with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and killed the siblings.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVye first appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' released by [[BioWare]] in [[2011]]. She appears on the planet Balmorra just after the bounty hunter lands. The player also has the \"[[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]]\" option of convincing the two of Tarro's deception. If this option is taken, Vye is reluctant to believe the hunter's story, but ultimately leaves when Vorr does. This article assumes the player chose the first \"dark side\" option.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0412\u0430\u0439\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
