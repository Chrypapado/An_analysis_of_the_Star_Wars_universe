During the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the Republic, while Klieri was in her twenties, Klieri and the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] intelligence operative [[Yrssk]] were dispatched to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nyriaan/Legends|Nyriaan]] to investigate the [[Deluge Experiment]], an covert effort that the [[Corporate Sector Authority/Legends|Corporate Sector Authority]] had initiated to flood Nyriaan and alter the world's climate. Operating from an apartment in the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Locus (settlement)|Locus]], Klieri spent several months gathering information on the Deluge Experiment. However, unbeknownst to her, Yrssk was secretly working for the CSA, and he fabricated some evidence to make it appear that Klieri was aiding the CSA. Eventually, the CSA decided to eliminate Klieri, and they sent an [[MRD-39B assassin droid]] to her apartment, to [[Death/Legends|murder]] her. While Klieri was in her living room, the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] fired shots into her chest and abdomen with it's [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], and with her last breaths, she crawled into her bedroom and died. The Republic subsequently sent a team of agents to Nyriaan to investigate Klieri's disappearance, and several days later they discovered her corpse inside her apartment.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizCite|Galaxy of Intrigue|The Perfect Storm}} {{1st}} {{C|Corpse}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic intelligence personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
