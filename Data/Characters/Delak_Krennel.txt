Ruthlessly exploited.|Delak Krennel|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement}}\n'''Delak Krennel''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Homeworld/Legends|native]] to [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. Krennel would eventually [[Imperial Naval Academy|enroll]] within the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Krennel was an aggressive commander, and was extremely [[Humanocentrism|Humanocentric]], displaying hatred towards [[Non-huMan|Non-human]]s.\n\nKrennel would ascend to the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]], and became the [[Commanding officer/Legends|commanding officer]] of the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Reckoning (Imperial II-class)|''Reckoning'']], and was assigned to serve [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] [[Empire of the Hand|based]] within the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Krennel hated Thrawn, and disobeyed direct orders and carried out ruthless strikes against the enemy. This tempted Thrawn into removing his [[Limb/Legends|arm]], and Krennel would replace it with a [[Cybernetics/Legends|prosthetic arm]]. Krennel would be sent to [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]] to be punished, but with the Imperial [[Battle of Endor/Legends|loss at]] [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], Krennel received none.\n\nKrennel went on to serve [[Director of Imperial Intelligence|Director]] [[Ysanne Isard]], current [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|leader]] of the Empire. Isard dispatched Krennel to [[Undercover operation on Axxila|eliminate]] [[Grand Vizier/Legends|Grand Vizier]] [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Pestage]], after leaving [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|service]]. Krennel would [[Death/Legends|kill]] Pestage, and become a [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] through the self-styled title \"[[Prince-Admiral/Legends|Prince-Admiral]]\". He would financially support Thrawn when he [[8 ABY/Legends|returned]] from the Unknown Regions to [[Thrawn campaign|fight]] the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Krennel would later desire peace and allow refugees to enter his territory. When the New Republic [[Battle of Distna|recovered plans]] that depicted Krennel supposedly [[Superweapon/Legends|building]] a [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]]-[[Pulsar Station|weapon]], New Republic forces would deploy to [[Battle of Ciutric|end]] Krennel's fiefdom. Krennel would eventually die in battle aboard the ''Reckoning'', ending his life and his faction.\n\n==Biography==\nKrennel was born on [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. At a young age, he demonstrated the firm [[Humanocentrism]] as well as the sadism and penchant for brutality that would mark his later career when he helped his father burn down [[Alien/Legends|alien]]-owned farmlands so they could be seized by a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[agro-combine]].\n\nHe began his Imperial service when he joined the [[Imperial Naval Academy|Prefsbelt IV Naval Academy]]. His academy record was relatively undistinguished, except for several prizes as an intramural unarmed combat champion (in later years, Krennel still kept himself in fighting trim, and his abilities were only enhanced by his mechanical arm).\n\nUpon graduation, Krennel rose through the ranks and was eventually assigned to [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] [[Thrawn's Unknown Regions armada|armada]], as a [[Captain/Legends|captain]] in command of the [[Reckoning (Imperial II-class)|''Reckoning'']]. However, the assignment was in actuality exile imposed by his then-commanding officer, [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Rufaan Tigellinus]] (who also had Thrawn exiled largely for his Chiss heritage), due to Krennel's brutality being extreme even for the Empire. Krennel resented serving beneath a nonhuman officer, as well as his post at the Unknown Regions, but could not voice his frustrations to Thrawn, so he instead used his rage to escalate his brutal nature on the alien prisoners. Eventually, Krennel's anger towards Thrawn had him decide to use a Vibropike against one of Thrawn's artworks, in mockery of his superior's tendency to utilize alien artwork to exploit an alien race's weakness during battle. This resulted in Thrawn ordering one of his Noghri Death Commandos to cut his arm off from the elbow down before he could damage it, leading to his gaining a prosthetic afterwards. This event gave him a new respect and fear of Thrawn, proceeding to rise to the rank of Admiral. Eventually, he chose to disobey an order to subjugate a [[Planet/Legends|world]]. Instead, Krennel chose to pacify it via [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombardment]], a choice that saw him recalled to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for a personal punishment from Palpatine. Before Palpatine could deliver his judgment, he [[Battle of Endor/Legends|perished]] at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] - leaving Krennel, sure of vindication, feeling as if he had a stain on his record.\n\n[[File:Delakkrennelvsysanne.jpg|thumb|left|Delak Krennel and [[Ysanne Isard]], each with their own secret agendas]]\n\nEarly in the conflict, Krennel aligned with [[General/Legends|General]] [[Paltr Carvin]], but accepted orders from the burgeoning authority of [[Ysanne Isard]]. On Isard's orders, Krennel attempted to [[Undercover operation on Axxila|capture]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] on [[Axxila/Legends|Axxila]], but was stopped by an [[AT3 Directive]] issued by [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]] at the behest of [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]]. The interruption irked Krennel, causing him to offer his allegiance directly to Isard in exchange for aid in retrieving Pestage on [[Ciutric IV]]. When Pestage escaped the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], he sought asylum with Krennel, unaware of his hatred for the [[Grand Vizier/Legends|Grand Vizier]]. Krennel strangled Pestage and seized his holdings in the [[Ciutric Hegemony]], before coldly murdering [[Pestage family|Pestage's entire family]]. Krennel then styled himself as a [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]], with the title of \"[[Prince-Admiral/Legends|Prince-Admiral]]\".\n\nDuring [[Thrawn campaign|Thrawn's campaign]], Krennel offered monetary support and pretended to pay heed to his former commander's call for unity. After the defeat of Thrawn at [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|Bilbringi]], Krennel was targeted to be an example to warlords of the New Republic's newly strengthened policy against them.\n\nWith the [[Ysanne Isard (clone)|clone Isard]], Krennel began a plot to sow chaos in the New Republic between Human and nonhuman species, waylay freight traffic to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] at [[Liinade III]], and conquer Coruscant. [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] put their plans to a quick end, with the aid of the original Ysanne Isard. [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] forwarded intelligence provided by Isard to the [[New Republic Defense Fleet/Legends|New Republic Defense Fleet]], which dispatched a flotilla to Ciutric before Krennel's forces could launch their attack. The flotilla, under the command of Admiral [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] crushed Krennel's forces in a [[Thrawn Pincer]] and seized the shield-stripped capital of the Hegemony. Krennel died aboard his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], ''Reckoning'', when a [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missile]] launched from either the ''[[Selonian Fire]]'' or ''[[Corusca Fire]]'' pierced the forward viewport, shattering the viewport and sending shards of transparisteel through Krennel's body. When the missile exploded, Krennel and the entire bridge were destroyed.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Why study the art of a species when I know all I need to know to destroy that species?|Delak Krennel|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement}}\nKrennel was a competent tactician and strategist (as evidenced by his promotion to Imperial Admiral), but he was a brutal man by nature and had little tolerance for the subtler approaches espoused by two of his old superiors, Thrawn and Isard. His reflexive response to any obstacle was to crush it.\n\nHe was very sadistic, as well as masochistic, the latter trait being adopted shortly after he lost his arm to Thrawn when trying to damage one of his artworks.\n\nDuring his brief tutelage by Isard's clone as ruler of the Citruic Hegemony, he began to experiment with political propaganda and other means of manipulating opinion in his favor, presenting himself as a sympathetic ruler rather than a tyrant. He started to see the effectiveness of these methods and flattered himself that he was a quick learner and would soon be able to master them without \"Isard's\" help. His death in battle cut short any promise he might have shown.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 30|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 30]] {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/the-imperial-warlords-despoilers-of-an-empire-part-1|int=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire|text=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire, Part 1}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-imperial-warlords-despoilers-of-an-empire-part-2|text=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire, Part 2|int=The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Delak Krennel\n|es=Delak Krennel\n|ja=\u30c7\u30ec\u30af\u30fb\u30af\u30ec\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\n|ru=\u0414\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043a \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\n|pl=Delak Krennel\n|fi=Delak Krennel\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Krennel, Delak}}\n[[Category:Ciutric Hegemony members]]\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs with prosthetics]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy admirals of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Imperial warlords]]\n[[Category:Individuals with lost limbs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Delak Krennel's regime]]"}}}]}}}}
