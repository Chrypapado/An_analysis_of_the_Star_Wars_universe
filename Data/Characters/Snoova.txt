You've found him. I don't like people who ask questions about me.|Snoova|Galactic Hunters}}\n'''Snoova''' was a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] and [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] who was active during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. He was ostracized from Wookiee society and faced the [[Death mark/Legends|death penalty]] on his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], due to his violation of the Wookiee injunction against the use of his [[Species/Legends|species]]' natural claws for anything other than climbing; rumors spoke of Snoova slashing at an opponent in a brawl over the affections of a [[Gender/Legends|female]] Wookiee paramour. Snoova escaped Kashyyyk as an outlaw and largely avoided other Wookiees. He turned to a life of [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunting&mdash;an unusual profession for a member of his species&mdash;and mercenary work. Because Wookiees were an [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] species under the regime of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Snoova specifically pursued bounties posted by the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government; his successes gained him such renown that he was able to travel through the Empire with impunity, and his [[Identichip/Legends|identification datawork]] was altered to name him as his own master.\n\nSnoova's unique appearance added to his high profile: he had [[Color/Legends|brown]] fur splotched with black, and he cut his head-[[Hair/Legends|hair]] into a flat-topped [[Spacer/Legends|spacer's]] style. He also wore a [[monocle ocular enhancer]] over his right [[Eye/Legends|eye]], a piece of equipment he had surgically rooted in his eye socket when he lost his right eye in pursuit of a target. Snoova preferred to work alone, but he occasionally teamed up with associates from [[Aurodium Sword/Legends|Aurodium Sword]] and the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] criminal organizations, as well as with fellow bounty hunters, such as the [[Ubese/Legends|Ubese]] [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]]. Snoova's fame inspired the [[Human replica droid]] [[Guri]] to disguise another well-known Wookiee, the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] [[operative]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], as Snoova in an effort to [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggle]] him past customs in [[Galactic City|Imperial City]], where Chewbacca was a wanted Rebel agent.\n\nSnoova's explosive temper and violent tendencies earned him a reputation as dangerous among the galaxy's criminal underworld. Although the bounty hunter knew how to ingratiate himself with clients, he regularly treated his prey with rough-edged contempt. Snoova was capable of stealthily shadowing a target, but his preference for brute force over subtle means manifested in his favored weapons: a [[Vibro-ax/Legends|vibro-ax]] and a heavy [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]]. Snoova was equally comfortable shredding his opponents with his climbing claws.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Whether or not you remember my face for the rest of time does not concern me.

He worked alongside the [[Ubese/Legends|Ubese]] bounty hunter [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]] on at least one occasion.<ref name=\"SotESB 66\" /> At another point, Snoova worked for or with [[Aurodium Sword/Legends|Aurodium Sword Executive Security]], a mercenary organization that provided security and paramilitary support to high-ranking clients.

He captured a bounty from the list and delivered his quarry to a fellow bounty hunter, [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]], at an Imperial outpost at [[Dee'ja Peak/Legends|Dee'ja Peak]] on the planet [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]].<ref name=\"GH LSS\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Galactic Hunters|''Galactic Hunters'' \"Light Side\" scenario campaign}}\nMeanwhile, witnesses spread rumors of the capture, and Rebel agents, posing as [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]], arrived at Dee'ja Peak to search out Snoova and reclaim his Rebel bounty. The Wookiee's contacts warned him of the Rebel stalkers, so Snoova lay in wait and surprised the interlopers. Near the center of the outpost, their leader was pushed into an alley, where Snoova and several Black Sun thugs attacked. The Wookiee bounty hunter was wounded during the long and vicious [[Skirmish at Dee'ja Peak|firefight]], and his Black Sun associates fled.

As he was leaving a meeting with Asteria in [[Asteria's townhouse|her townhouse]], the Wookiee was ambushed by thugs with [[Stun baton/Legends|shock batons]], [[Force pike/Legends|stun pikes]], and [[tranq slug]]s. The bounty hunter was unable to fight them off, and when he next awoke, found himself in a tiny cell, his arms chained above his head and his hands encased in mitts to prevent him from lashing out with his claws. Eventually, the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Vigo/Legends|Vigo]] [[Lonay]] informed the prisoner that he had been taken \"out of the picture\" for a time and locked up at a slave camp so that someone could impersonate the hunter on Coruscant.

As part of his disguise, Chewbacca shaved the top of his head into a squared-off style and dyed black spots into his fur.
