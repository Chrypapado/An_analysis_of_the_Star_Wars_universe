He usually opted to return to his contractor with proof of death. However, he sometimes helped his [[Agapos the Ninth|targets]] to escape to the Rebellion, and faked proof of death so that the targets would be safe from the Empire. He claimed the bounties on their 'dead bodies' as well. He wore a bandoleer of black reptile skin, so as to ward off any [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] hunters looking to kill him for sport.\n\nChen befriended [[Tinian I'att Azur-Jamin|Tinian I'att]], and became her ''Ng'rhr'', or clan-uncle. He took Tinian on as a Hunt apprentice, and they participated in three Hunts together before they decided to hunt down [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]], the infamous Trandoshan bounty hunter. Chen and Tinian eventually formed a loose relationship with him to capture [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] after the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]]. This was actually a ruse to double-cross Bossk and entrap him in illegal Wookiee pelt-baiting in the [[Lomabu system]]. Chen had a handheld [[Slicer droid/Legends|slicer droid]] named [[Flirt]].\n\nChen was one of the more famous bounty hunters who rose to prominence after the fall of the [[Bounty Hunters' Guild/Legends|Bounty Hunters' Guild]]. He once owned a personal [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] called the [[Wroshyr (starship)|''Wroshyr'']].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|6|To Fight Another Day}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|10|Only Droids Serve the Maker}}\n*''[[The Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk]]''\n*''[[Hard Merchandise]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 10: Bounty Hunters]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|106|DRA2, ''X10-D Draft Droid''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|124|Blood Feud!}}\n*{{DB|character|bossk|Bossk|archivedate=20110718213905}}\n*{{InsiderCite|132|A Certain Point of View (Star Wars Insider)|A Certain Point of View: Expanding Empire: How ''The Empire Strikes Back'' Rocks the EU}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/the-not-so-magnificent-seven|text=The Not-So Magnificent Seven|int=The Not-So Magnificent Seven}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Chenlambec\n|es=Chenlambec\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
