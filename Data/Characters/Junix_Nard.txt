He was the owner and [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] of the [[Junix's Joint]] [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. He also ran a small store within the cantina where he sold [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] cards, among other goods.\n\nLike others on Tatooine, Nard felt that the destruction of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] at the hands of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] was a good thing, as it \"got things moving in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]\". He also held the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in low regard, saying that it was \"about time someone kicked the Republic in the tail\". Furthermore, Nard thought of Tatooine as an unpleasant, backwater [[Planet/Legends|planet]] that had little going for it.\n\nIn [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], four thousand years after the [[Jedi Civil War]], the cantina kept the name of Junix.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Junix Nard\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u0434\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nard, Junix}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
