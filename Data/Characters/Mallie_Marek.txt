Although raised and [[Jedi training/Legends|instructed]] to uphold the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Code]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], Mallie developed an emotional attachment to [[Kento Marek]], a fellow Jedi Knight whom she met on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Talus/Legends|Talus]]. Defying strict tenets of the Order, Mallie and Kento [[Marriage/Legends|married]] in secret after falling in love with each other. During their self-imposed [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]], the Republic was reorganized into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and all Jedi&mdash;including former Jedi&mdash;were declared enemies of the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]]. In order to escape the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]], Mallie and her husband went into hiding, eventually settling on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], the [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Species/Legends|race]].\n\nAt some point after building their [[Kento Marek's hut|home]] on Kashyyyk, Mallie gave birth to a son, [[Galen Marek]]. Not long afterward, Mallie fought a group of [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]] in defense of the Wookiees and to protect her [[House of Marek|family]]. Her subsequent [[Death/Legends|death]] forced Kento Marek to raise their only son on his own. When [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] launched a massive [[Battle of Kashyyyk (c. 18 BBY)|invasion]] on Kashyyyk, Kento Marek was killed in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]] against the Sith Lord. But since Mallie's son was an extremely rare prodigy of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Vader chose to [[Sith training|train]] Galen Marek as his own [[Sith apprentice/Legends|secret apprentice]] and [[Sith assassin/Legends|personal assassin]]. In time, Mallie Marek and her husband were forgotten by their son, who knew himself only as \"Starkiller.\" Before Galen's redemption and untimely demise, he recovered a few repressed memories of the father and mother that he could barely remember.\n\n==Biography==\nBefore marrying into the [[House of Marek|Marek family]], Mallie fought for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. [[Jedi training/Legends|Trained]] as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Knight]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], she and her fellow [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] were commissioned to serve as [[Jedi Commander/Legends|commanders]] and [[Jedi General/Legends|generals]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]]. While fighting against [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Talus/Legends|Talus]], Mallie became acquainted with a fellow Jedi Knight named [[Kento Marek]].<ref name=\"Databank\" /><ref name=\"SWDB_Starkiller\">{{DB|character|starkiller|Starkiller (Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice)|archivedate=20110913113406}}</ref>\n\nUnlike Mallie, who had no interest in fame and glory through war, Marek was a thrill-seeking young Jedi that yearned to make a great name for himself on the battlefield. Regardless of their different views on the war, the two Jedi gradually developed a rapport with each other. Even though infatuation and especially love were expressly forbidden by the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]], Kento and Mallie developed feelings for one another.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Their mutual attraction culminated into a secret marriage, thus forcing them both into a self-imposed exile as the Order continued to fight on behalf of the Republic.<ref name=\"SWDB_Starkiller\" /> Disguising themselves as a pair of medics, the two former Jedi abandoned the Clone Wars and escaped into the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] in order to forge a new life together.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nWhen the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]], the true persona of [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Chancellor]] Palpatine, issued [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] to the [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], thousands of Jedi officers were murdered by their own [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]]. Sidious used the opportunity to reorganize the Republic into the first [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Under his [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], every single Jedi&mdash;including ex-Jedi&mdash;were targeted for extermination. In order to escape from the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic-wide]] [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|genocide]], Mallie and Kento Marek hid on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] where they were protected by the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]].<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nWhile living together in their [[Kento Marek's hut|new home]] on Kashyyyk, Mallie gave birth to a boy and named him [[Galen Marek]].<ref name=\"SWDB_Starkiller\" /> Due to her respect and admiration for the Marek family's Wookiee allies, Mallie often told stories of the Wookiees' renowned strength and bravery to her son. However, their time together was cut short when a group of [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]] infiltrated Kashyyyk with the intention of capturing Wookiees in order to sell them into slavery.<ref>''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> In the midst of the fighting, Mallie convinced her husband to take Galen to safety while she defended the Wookiees against the slavers. Although extremely reluctant to leave his wife behind, Kento agreed that he was the logical choice, due to his greater knowledge of the area's terrain.<ref name=\"TFUIIn\">[[The Force Unleashed II (novel)|''The Force Unleashed II'' novel]]</ref>\n\nAs Kento took their son to safety, Mallie charged into the fighting and, using her [[Color/Legends|yellow-bladed]] [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], killed many Trandoshans with her in the process. Her efforts, however, cost Mallie her life. In honor of his wife's sacrifice, Kento became resolved to raise Galen on his own while remaining on Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"TFUIIn\" /> Yet he too would be killed, thus leaving Galen Marek as an orphan to be raised by his father's killer, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. Galen, having lost both parents at very early point in his life, was too young to remember either of them while constantly trying to survive under Vader's [[Sith training|brutal training regimen]]. Under the codename \"Starkiller,\" Mallie's son became the Sith Lord's [[Sith apprentice/Legends|secret apprentice]] and [[Sith assassin/Legends|relentless enforcer]].<ref name=\"TFUvg\" /><ref name=\"TFUn\">[[The Force Unleashed (novel)|''The Force Unleashed'' novel'']]</ref>\n\nAs Starkiller grew into a young man, devoid of any recollection of his mother and father, he developed a fierce sense of loyalty to his [[Sith Master/Legends|master]]. Despite years of the brutality and virtual torture that defined the training methods of the Sith, Darth Vader was the closest thing that Starkiller had to a father. Thus, he willingly obeyed Vader's will without question, killing many individuals throughout his short life without mercy or hesitation.<ref name=\"TFUvg\" /><ref name=\"TFUn\" />\n\nGalen Marek's untimely demise necessitated Darth Vader's attempts to [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] the dead son of Kento and Mallie Marek.<ref name=\"TFUIIn\" /> But due to the inconvenient unreliability of cloning, the project was held back by consistent failures that produced [[Aberrant clone|aberrant monstrosities]].<ref name=\"TFUIIvg\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]''</ref> The more stable versions of Galen were undermined by the identity crises that resulted as a side effect of the [[Memory flash|memory imprints]].<ref name=\"TFUIIn\" /> Following the [[Assault on Kamino|Battle of]] [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], the legacy of Mallie and Kento Marek was shared by their late son's between two surviving clones&mdash;[[Subject 1138|Starkiller]] and the [[Dark Apprentice]].<ref name=\"TFUIIvg\" /> Although Starkiller inherited Galen's feelings for [[Juno Eclipse]], he spared no feelings for the dead parents of his [[Prime clone|genetic donor]]. As far as he was concerned, neither Kento or Mallie mattered to him at all.<ref name=\"TFUIIn\" /> The Dark Apprentice succeeded where all of his cloned brethren failed by purging himself of Galen's emotions, with the exceptions of anger and hatred.<ref name=\"TFUIIvg\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMallie Marek was a compassionate Jedi Knight who believed in defending the freedom and safety of others. She possessed a strong sense of sympathy for those who suffered and, as a result, fought in the Clone Wars to protect civilians that were caught in the crossfire. Unlike most other young Jedi, Mallie was not a thrill-seeking adventurer who yearned for glory and recognition. She saw service in the Grand Army of the Republic as an unfortunate necessity rather than an opportunity for fame and excitement. Her convictions were strong enough to cause Kento Marek, a fellow member of the Jedi Order, to see the war through her point of view.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nAfter Kento and Mallie settled on Kashyyyk as man and wife, Mallie came to regard the Wookiees as honorable and trustworthy allies. When she gave birth to a son, Galen Marek, Mallie would tell stories to her son of the Wookiees' famous exploits and also taught him how to build a friendship band. She deeply loved her family and was willing to sacrifice her life so that they could live.<ref name=\"TFUIIn\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a trained Knight of the Jedi Order, Mallie Marek was gifted with a connection to the Force that was strong enough to deem her worthy for Jedi training.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> On Kashyyyk, shortly before her death, Mallie wielded a yellow-bladed lightsaber against mercenary slavers. Her skills in lightsaber combat enabled her to strike down many Trandoshans before she was ultimately overwhelmed and killed.<ref name=\"TFUIIn\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[The Force Unleashed (novel)|''The Force Unleashed '' novel]] {{1stm}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)|''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed'' video game]] {{Mo}} {{C|in-game Databank}}\n*[[The Force Unleashed II (novel)|''The Force Unleashed II'' novel]] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{DB|character|starkiller|Starkiller (Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice)|archivedate=20110913113406}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mallie Marek\n|es=Mallie Marek\n|nl=Mallie Nion\n|pl=Mallie Marek\n|pt=Mallie Marek\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marek, Mallie}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge victims]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi]]"}}}]}}}}
