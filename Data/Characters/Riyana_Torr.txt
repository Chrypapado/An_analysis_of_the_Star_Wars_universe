Leia is one of their most vital members.|Riyana Torr|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n'''Riyana Torr''' was a young [[human]] [[Gender|female]] who survived the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of her [[homeworld]] [[Alderaan]] in the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]] due to the fact she was offworld with her missionary [[parent]]s at the time. By the year [[5 ABY]], she had joined the [[Alderaan Flotilla]], a collection of [[starship]]s housing Alderaanians survivors. While the flotilla was based in the [[Alderaan system]] amongst the remains of Alderaan, Torr attended a meeting on board the [[Alderaanian escort frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' to discuss the future of the flotilla. Torr and the other meeting attendees argued about whether they should remain in the Alderaan [[Star system|system]] or resettle a new planet until a group of [[New Republic]] vessels arrived hauling the remains of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]], which the Alderaanians decided to use to build a new [[space station]].\n\n==Biography==\nRiyana Torr was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] born to a pair of missionaries native to the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> In the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]],<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' establishes that [[Alderaan]] was [[The Disaster|destroyed]] in [[0 BBY]].</ref> Torr was offworld traveling with her [[parent]]s as part of a [[Unidentified roving school|roving school]] that offered help to the needy when her [[homeworld]] was [[The Disaster|destroyed]] by the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> By the year [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date\">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> Torr had joined the [[Alderaan Flotilla]], a collection of [[starship]]s initially gathered by the [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and the [[Rebel pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] that housed the surviving population of Alderaan. While the flotilla was positioned amidst the remains of their homeworld in the [[Alderaan system]], she attended a meeting on board the [[Alderaanian escort frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' to discuss the future of the flotilla.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nAt the meeting the flotilla's [[Regent Administrator]] [[Eglyn Valmor]] argued that the fleet should remain in the Alderaan [[Star system|system]], while others like the [[teacher]] [[Icar Orliss]] and the [[diplomat]] [[Janis Pol]] wanted to resettle a new world. After Pol claimed they would not need to worry about going through [[New Republic]] protocols to resettle a world since they were not part of the Republic, Torr argued that they were part of the Republic due to Organa's prominent role in their government.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nThe arguing within the meeting continued until it was interrupted by reports of several large vessels approaching the flotilla. Torr and the others were then shocked to see a number of New Republic vessels hauling the remains of the Death Star toward the flotilla, which fellow flotilla member [[Teven Gale]] then revealed he had worked with Organa and Verlaine to acquire for the flotilla as a resource. Valmor and Gale then suggested building a new [[space station]] from the superweapon's remains, although Orliss still remained stubborn on resettling elsewhere.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nIn 5 ABY Torr was young enough that Teven Gale thought she was probably too young to be at the meeting on the ''Sunspire''. She was visibly nervous while speaking at the meeting.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRiyana Torr first appeared in the novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', which was written by [[Chuck Wendig]]<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> and released released on [[July 12]], [[2016]].<ref name=\"Penguin-eBook\">{{Penguin|books/531277/life-debt-aftermath-star-wars-by-chuck-wendig/9781101966945|Life Debt: Aftermath (Star Wars)|https://web.archive.org/web/20170509143435/http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/531277/life-debt-aftermath-star-wars-by-chuck-wendig/9781101966945}} {{C|eBook}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Riyana Torr\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Torr, Riyana}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
