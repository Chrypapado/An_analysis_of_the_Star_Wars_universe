While most members of the squadron made it past the defenses into the atmosphere, Raner was cut off from the rest of the squadron when the Empire reactivated its orbital gate, resulting in the deaths of two of his fellow pilots, one of them being [[Vangos Grek]]. Raner survived by pulling up at the last second, and continued to support the fight with two other members of Blue Squadron who had also been cut off.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\nDuring the battle, he landed the first series of shots that, in the end, won the battle for the Alliance. While being chased by TIE fighters, he destroyed the shield generator of the [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Persecutor]]'', opening it up to a barrage of ion torpedoes from [[Jon Vander]] and [[Gold Squadron|his pilots]] that disabled the vessel. The crippled warship would later be rammed by the ''[[Lightmaker]]'' and used to destroy the Scarif Shield Gate and the ''[[Intimidator]]'', securing the [[Death Star plans]] and a narrow victory for the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\nRaner wrote a [[X-wing Flight Manual|combat basics manual]] on flying [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|T-65 X-wing starfighters]] that was used by new Rebel pilots.
