Grimes was an acquaintance of [[Selima DeWitt]], the daughter of [[Davin DeWitt|the Baron Administrator]] of the [[platform city]] [[Bayonard]], but after he was sent to jail for a few [[Standard month/Legends|months]], he lost contact with DeWitt. In the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], DeWitt went missing and a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] were hired by her father to look for her. Grimes was present in Bayonard during the agents' investigation and he overheard a conversation between the agents and DeWitt's friend [[Jee Sallis]], who informed the agents that DeWitt had moved to the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Gadrin]]. Eager to re-acquaint himself with DeWitt, Grimes offered to transport the agents to Gadrin in his [[Airspeeder/Legends|airspeeder]]. The agents accepted Grime's offer and they traveled with him to Gadrin. However, just as Grimes' speeder approached the city, it was pulled over by a group of [[Office of Peace and Security]] [[Officer/Legends|officers]], who took Grimes into their custody.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Find the Lady]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grimes, Lethbridge}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
