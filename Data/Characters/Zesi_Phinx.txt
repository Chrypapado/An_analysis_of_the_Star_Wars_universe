Exhibiting none of the puffiness around the nose seen on most Anati, Phinx could easily pass for a lithe [[Human/Legends|Human]] woman in her late twenties.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nA skilled tracker and martial artist, Zesi Phinx's mundane abilities paled before her power in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of the Force. Her skill with [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathy]] and [[Mind trick/Legends|mind control]] was on a par with other Anzati, but her considerable aptitude for [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]] allowed her to drain the energy from [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] [[power pack]]s, [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]] [[Energy cell/Legends|energy cells]], and even the portable generators possessed by droids and [[E-Web heavy repeating blaster|E-Web blasters]], leaving her prey helpless.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phinx, Zesi}}\n[[Category:Anzati]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]"}}}]}}}}
