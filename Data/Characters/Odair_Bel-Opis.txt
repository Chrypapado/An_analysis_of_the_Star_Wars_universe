They can't hurt me.''\"<br>\"''They have been attacking vital targets. And you are our most vital.|[[Lozen Tolruck]] and Odair|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\nOdair Bel-Opis served as [[Lozen Tolruck]]'s [[attach\u00e9]] on the [[Grand Moff]]'s [[Lozen Tolruck's island fortress|island fortress]] on [[Kashyyyk]]. They ambushed [[Jom Barell]]'s [[commando]] team attempting to capture a [[shuttle]] platform, and captured Barell, taking [[Gender|his]] [[eye]].<ref name=\"ALD30\" />\n\nDuring the [[Wookiee]] [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|insurgency]], Bel-Opis counseled Tolruck to remain within his fortress, despite the Grand Moff's desire to [[Hunting|hunt]] the natives. He and Tolruck confronted [[Sinjir Rath Velus]] when the double-[[agent]] arrived in the fortress in the guise of [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Imperial officer|officer]] [[Jorrin Turnbull]]. Odair fought Sinjir [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]] while Tolruck's followers watched and cheered, and bested the [[New Republic]] agent with a choke hold. However, Rath Velus was able to disrupt the Imperial [[control module]], resulting in a [[prison]] break. Odair attempted to [[Death|kill]] Sinjir, but was attacked by an escaped Wookiee who struck him across the head with a saw blade. Falling, Odair was straddled by the Wookiee, and screamed as the beast ripped off his arms.<ref name=\"ALD30\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You may speak if you have words.|[[Lozen Tolruck]]|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\nAs the personal attach\u00e9 to Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck, Odair Bel-Opis was a capable and trustworthy individual. Organized and straightforward, Bel-Opis had no designs on Tolruck's position, making him ideal as a servant. He proved himself to be a brutal and merciless killer, and Tolruck considered him as necessary and simple as a [[club]]. While on Kashyyyk Bel-Opis grew dark, patchy stubble over his face, reflecting his untamed environment.<ref name=\"ALD30\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0440 \u0411\u0435\u043b-\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\n|pl=Odair Bel-Opis\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bel-Opis, Odair}}\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire military personnel]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
