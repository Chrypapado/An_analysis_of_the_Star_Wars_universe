She was a pretty young girl who tied her hair in two bouncing but stiff tails that looked similar to [[Lekku/Legends|lekku]].\n\nShe worked for [[Nirama]]'s organization in the asteroid space station [[Darkside (space station)|Darkside]], in the [[Cularin system asteroid belt]].\n\nIn [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], she received smuggler [[Xav Verivax]], who tried to flirt with her. She then took a team of undercover agents who had came in Verivax's ship to see her boss, [[Vin Tal'benes]].\n\nMertz was not as grumpy as most of the people in Darkside, but she was not really extrovert either.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[MidWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mertz, Dina}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]"}}}]}}}}
