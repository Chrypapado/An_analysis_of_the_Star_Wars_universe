Influential and corrupt, he pampered his son, [[Judder Page/Legends|Judder Page]], who in turn despised him and used his wealth to train in combat. The [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] eventually sent his son to the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]], hoping that Page's combat skills could serve the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Many doors were opened for Page due to the Senator's influence, but the young man ultimately defected to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Imperial Period]], a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]]<ref name=\"httesb 30\" /> represented his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]] in the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]].<ref name=\"SWE\">''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|under \"Lieutenant Page\"}}</ref> He was a prominent yet corrupt [[Senator/Legends|senator]] who gave his son, [[Judder Page/Legends|Judder Page]], a pampered upbringing.

Inspired by tales of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Page used his father's wealth to train himself in a variety of combat and defense techniques.

The Senator sent him to the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]], reasoning that if his son were to train to be a [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]], his skills would best be put to use in the service of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. As the son of a prominent senator from [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], Page found that vast avenues of study were open to him.
