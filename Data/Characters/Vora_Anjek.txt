A [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] working for [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Lon Cope|Cope]] discovered the existence of the [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] smuggling ring of the Red Circle Gang and the location of the [[Ryll Smuggler Base]].<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|CorSec Case Files: Ryll Smuggling Ring|Corellia}}</ref> After the assassination of the [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] of Kor Vella [[Deel Draav]] by the Red Circle Gang, the CorSec raided the Ryll Smuggler Base. The spacer eliminated the underboss [[Ubis Reendorr]] and retrieved his access code for the Red Circle Base. The CorSec later assaulted the Red Circle Base nearby and killed most of the guards. The spacer used Reendorr's access code to slice the mainframe in the courtyard of the base and learned the identity of the three local Chirq Council leaders: Vora Anjek, Annor Fash and Vella Corse. The CorSec therefore attacked the basement of the Red Circle Base and killed the three leaders. During the assault, the spacer also discovered that the [[Elite Council|leaders]] of the Chirq Council were based in the city [[Doaba Guerfel/Legends|Doaba Guerfel]].<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\" /> The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCTEC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: The Elite Council|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVora Anjek was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|CorSec Case Files: The Unlucky Mayor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anjek, Vora}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]\n[[Category:Chirq Council]]"}}}]}}}}
