He worked as a [[Spice/Legends|spice]] [[Merchant/Legends|trader]], and operated out of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld's]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Bela Vistal/Legends|Bela Vistal]]. Sometime after the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Reshad was doing trading business with associates of the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Shalera]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] when he was blackmailed by a man who recorded the conversation. Reshad did not want to pay the [[Unidentified blackmailer|blackmailer]], and he hired a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]] him. In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Reshad was affiliated with the crime lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] on the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], and he made a large profit selling spice in the Hutt's court. He secretly used part of it to fund the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. That year, Reshad was present in the Hutt's [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|palace]] when several allies of Jabba's [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] [[Siege of Jabba's Palace|arrived]] to bargain for his freedom, for which Jabba eventually sentenced them to die at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon/Legends|Great Pit of Carkoon]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Right to the point.
