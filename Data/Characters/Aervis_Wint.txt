He sometimes nervously chewed on the tip of one of his ears. In [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], fellow employee [[Broof Yurdel]] and twelve other of the company's employees disappeared to join the [[Cularin resistance]]. The additional workload caused Aervis to lose a lot of sleep.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wint, Aervis}}\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Gungans of unspecified race]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
