The Myyydril claimed he was their chef, but also said that he didn't know the difference between [[Muon Gold]] and [[bofa treat]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Whatever you want, I can get it.|\"Shady\" Pers|Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)}}\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Pers contracted a fellow [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] and [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to retrieve a special crate from an abandoned [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] camp in the [[Kkowir Forest]]. The spacer arrived at the camp to find it being guarded by [[Blackscale Clan/Legends|Blackscale Clan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]]. The spacer killed them, including their apparent leader, a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] named [[Myssith]], and recovered the crate. Returning it to Pers, the spacer was rewarded with 3,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and a [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol/Legends|DL-44]] named the Black Falcon, which was a duplicate of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] hero [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo's]] modified weapon.\n\nLater, Pers was confronted by an [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]] agent looking to obtain a [[Krayt dragon pearl/Legends|Krayt dragon pearl]], which was recently delivered to Pers from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. In a dark corner of a [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], Pers and his acquaintances were cornered, and soon most of the thugs chose to escape from battle, leaving Pers alone. Hands tied, Pers had no choice but to hand over the pearl, which was worth 100,000 credits.<ref name=\"DS\">{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:ShadyPersSWG.jpg|thumb|right|Pers in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'']]\n\"Shady\" Pers was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] (NPC) in the expansion pack [[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees|''Rage of the Wookiees'']] for the [[Video game#Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].
