You'd think a  dozen Jedi and two dozen snubby jocks won the whole thing.|Afyon to [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]]|X-Wing: Rogue Squadron}}\n[[Captain/Legends|Captain]] ''' Afyon''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who served as the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] ''[[Eridain]]'', and later the escort frigate ''[[Larkhess]]'', which was eventually relegated to cargo transport duties in the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\nA native of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], Afyon was a veteran of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. He resented the amount of praise given to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] jocks, thinking it detracted from the sacrifices made by common [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] as himself. He later lobbied for Alderaanian demilitarization.\n\nAfyon was off-planet when Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] and vowed to make the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] pay for its crimes. He signed up for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] as a first officer on a [[DP20 frigate|Corellian gunship]], and worked his way up to [[Captain/Legends|Captain]]. He later captained ''Eridain'' during the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].\n\nDuring the later [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], he felt that [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] was being treated the same way the Jedi and [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] from the Clone Wars had been, with the same effect towards the other soldiers. During the [[Thrawn campaign]], Afyon was one of the few who saw [[Borsk Fey'lya]]'s support for the military for what it really was, a political bid for power.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]''\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/source/praji/20090205.html|text=Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji|int=Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Afyon\n|es=Afyon\n|hu=Afyon\n|tr=Afyon\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance Fleet captains]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Defense Fleet captains]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
