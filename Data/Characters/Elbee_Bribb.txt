At some point during [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] history, Bribb ventured into the [[Coruscant underworld|Coruscant Undercity]] and sold an unpublished expos\u00e9 of Coruscant's [[Spice/Legends|spice]] trade to the spice [[Lord/Legends|lord]] [[Volven Roxe]]. However, after departing from Roxe's spice den, Bribb was captured by a group of [[Cthon/Legends|Cthon]] and taken into the deepest sub-levels of Coruscant, where he was locked inside a Cthon fattening cage. Following Bribb's capture, the Coruscant authorities were too preoccupied with other matters to investigate his disappearance, so Veritas hired a group of freelance agents to find him. The agents tracked Bribb down and when they eventually located him, he was so terrified as a result of his recent experiences that he refused to leave his cage and depart with the agents. As a consequence, the agents were forced to drag Bribb from the cage against his will.\n\n==Sources==\n''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bribb, Elbee}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
