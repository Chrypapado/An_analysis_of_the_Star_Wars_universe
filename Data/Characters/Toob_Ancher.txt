The same tricks he's teaching you.

He was the brother of [[Karl Mathieu Ancher]].\n\n==Biography==\nToob spent most of his time in the [[Ottega system/Legends|Ottega system]]. One day, a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] that was planted by a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] exploded in his face. His face was horribly disfigured, with his left [[Eye/Legends|eye]] completely blown out and his right eye had to be replaced with [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] prosthesis. Shortly afterward, he contracted ''Brekken Vinthern'', more commonly known as the [[Bitter Winter]] disease, and he began to go insane. He was taken to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Redcap]] by [[Drake Paulsen]] to search out [[Saylor Marjan]] and to recover a debt owed to [[Saadoon-Kauldi]]. While on Redcap, Toob completely lost his mind and went insane. He set out to attack the ''[[Aremin]]'', believing he could escape on his own ship. Drake Paulsen was forced to shoot him out of the sky to prevent Imperials from shooting him down.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|2|Out of the Cradle}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|5|A Bitter Winter}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Black Sands of Socorro]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ancher, Toob}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
