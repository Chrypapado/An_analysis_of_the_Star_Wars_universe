Though not a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] himself, he lived by many [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi ideals]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]], Thi Xon Yimmon resided on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during the last days of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. While not a known [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], Yimmon was loyal to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and lived by the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]] as best he could, mastering several martial arts and renowned for his wisdom. When the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] executed [[Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150|Contingency]] [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] and wiped out the Jedi Order, Yimmon and several other Jedi loyalists formed an underground resistance group known as [[Whiplash]] to assist surviving Jedi escape persecution by the newly formed [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. As the [[Jedi Temple]] lay in smoldering ruin on the surface, Yimmon was appointed leader of the group as his binary brain was able to process the multitudes of information flowing into the organization at all times. During a meeting with [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Jax Pavan]], Yimmon was unsure of whether or not to assist the young [[Force Adept]] [[Kajin Savaros]] or the initiation of [[Tuden Sal]] into the organization. Fearing that Savaros status of a person of interest by the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]] would put the whole organization in danger, Yimmon agreed to think on it while permitting Sal to form a plan to assassinate the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]].<ref name=\"CNIII\" />\n\nAs Pavan agreed to Sal's plan and the use of [[I-5YQ]] in the plot, Savaros and [[Gray Paladin]] [[Laranth Tarak]] were captured by [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] encouraging Pavan to see Sal's plan come to fruition. While Yimmon scoured the group's membership for a possible traitor, the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Den Dhur]] informed him of Pavan's intentions to speed up the plan. Escorted by Dhur and Sal to the meeting place, they arrived moments after Vader obtained and contained a sample of the [[bota]] plant from Laranth Tarak and became intoxicated with the power of the Force. Unleashing raw energy in an unbelievable manner, Yimmon and his allies would have surely been killed had Vader not have been defeated by his aide [[Haninum Tyk Rhinann]] and allowing them to escape. Regrouping, Yimmon agreed to transport the amnesic Savaros to [[Shili/Legends|Shili]] for healing with [[the Silent]].<ref name=\"CNIII\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Coruscant Nights III: Patterns of Force]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The Last Jedi (novel)|''The Last Jedi'']]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Thi Xon Yimmon\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yimmon Thi Xon}}\n[[Category:Cereans]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Whiplash members]]"}}}]}}}}
