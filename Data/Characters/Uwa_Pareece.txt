She emigrated to the [[planet]] [[Naboo]], where she oversaw a group of [[musician]]s known as [[Melodic Order]]. Pareece and the musicians worked in [[Club Deeja]], a club in the [[city]] of [[Keren]], where Melodic Order had no contact with non-Alderaanians. The group's cloister vow was to preserve the cultural integrity of their [[music]], so they performed via [[hologram]] but maintained in-person contact with Pareece. After the [[Galactic Empire]] [[The Disaster|destroyed]] [[Alderaan]], Pareece kept the event hidden from Melodic Order so they would continue to perform. [[Mul Sanaka]], the owner of Club Deeja, agreed with her approach in order to protect the profits and enjoyment generated by the club's customers.<ref name=\"Princess Leia 2\" />\n\n[[File:Naboo_Marina_District.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pareece witnesses the arrival of Organa's shuttle arrive in the Marina District of Keren.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin]], [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]&mdash;the last surviving member of the [[House of Organa|ruling family]] of Alderaan&mdash;set out on a [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to rescue all of the Alderaanians who still lived after Alderaan's destruction, as the Empire was hunting down all of the survivors. Organa traveled to Naboo to find Melodic Order. She arrived at the club, where she identified herself as [[First minister|First Minister]] Solo of the Empire. She was confronted by Sanaka, however, who knew her true identity and purpose on Naboo. Sanaka and his guards tried to attack Organa, but Organa and her companions, [[Evaan Verlaine]] and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], fought them off. Sanaka nearly killed Organa, but Pareece intervened and knocked Sanaka unconscious using the [[stun]] setting on her ''[[Satine's Lament]]'' [[blaster pistol]].<ref name=\"Princess Leia 2\" />\n\nPareece told Organa how she had concealed the truth from Melodic Order, before gathering the musicians together to tell them what happened. The princess urged the group not to cast blame on Pareece, but to instead join her in order to save their fellow Alderaanians. Pareece and the Melodic Order agreed to join, and they set out for the planet [[Volcano|volcanic]] planet [[Sullust]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] to find more survivors.<ref name=\"Princess Leia 2\" />\n\n====Trouble on Sullust and Espirion and Skaradosh====\n{{Quote|Leia to the ship ''Lord Junn''.

Pareece, now the [[captain]] of the ''Lord Junn'', stayed in [[orbit]] over the planet until Organa contacted her from the enclave and ordered her to flee into [[hyperspace]] because their position had been betrayed to the Empire and they had dispatched an Imperial [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel-class'' landing craft]] to invade the compound. Pareece and the yacht's [[pilot]] hid with the ship.<ref name=\"Leia 3\">[[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]]</ref> They soon returned to Sullust, however, to assist in the evacuation of the enclave along with the [[Sullustan]] [[smuggler]] [[Nien Nunb]] and his ship, the ''[[Mellcrawler]]''.<ref name=\"Leia 4\">[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]]</ref>\n\n[[Standard day|Days]] later,<ref name=\"Leia 4 days\">[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]] Early on in the issue, [[Covis]] says, \"You've been bowing and scraping to 'that woman' all week.\" And throughout the rest of the issue it implies that at least several days have past since the end of [[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]]</ref> the last of the Alderaanians had been successfully evacuated. So the ''Lord Junn'' was moved to orbit over the planet [[Espirion]]. At that time, Astane charged Tace with [[treason]] because it had been her that had betrayed their position to the Empire&mdash;Tace had relayed her experiences with Organa to her sister, [[Tula]], who was stationed aboard an Imperial [[Star Destroyer]], and had in turn, reported her findings to her [[commander]], [[Dreed]], who had launched the assault. Organa took control of the situation and set Tace free, so Pareece went to prepare for the reunification talks on Espirion.

The Alder-Espirion's leader, [[Chief]] [[Beon Beonel]] had agreed to meet with Organa about reunifying his people with Organa's, and using the extensive Espirion military to fend off the Empire if it attacked. However, Organa had become intertwined in Tace's predicament, so she assigned Pareece to represnt her, and Astane as Pareece's co-emissary.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nPareece and Astane then traveled to an Espirion city and met with Beonel's assistant, [[Consul]] [[Rill]]. Rill expressed his remorse over Alderaan's loss, and then introduced them to Beonel. Beonel, however, quickly realized he was not welcome by all&mdash;Astane was appalled that Beonel was only half Alderaanian and openly showed her disgust. Pareece was equally appalled at Astane's racist views and tried to salvage the situation by assuring the chief that not all of Organa's people though the way Astane did. Pareece ordered Astane to apologize, but she refused, prompting Beonel to chide that the had nothing left discuss, and stormed away. Pareece, Astane and Rill headed to Rill's office, where Pareece pleaded with him that the misunderstanding needn't destroy the reunification talks. Rill said the chief had made his decision, and it wouldn't change. Pareece had become desperate and begged Rill to tell Beonel that Organa would come personally to talk, which would prove that Organa did care, and that she was not bigoted like Astane.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nDefeated, however, the pair soon left to return to the ''Lord Junn'', but came across Beonel, who was piloting an [[airspeeder]], again. Pareece tried to talk with him, but he rejected her, so, at Astane's driving force, they left the planet. At returning to their flagship, they were met by an entire [[fleet]] of Alderaanian ships, which had come to aid Organa in her mission to reunify the people of Alderaan. A short time later, the fleet moved to the [[desert]] planet [[Skaradosh]], where Organa and Verlaine had just rescued Tula from execution from the Empire and killed Dreed&mdash;with the help of Nien Nunb. Tace shaved her head in order for her not to be confused with her sister, Tula, who had committed treason.<ref name=\"Leia 5\">[[Princess Leia 5|''Princess Leia'' 5]]</ref>\n\n[[Dreed's Star Destroyer]], however, commanded then by<ref name=\"Leia 5\" /> [[Venk]],<ref name=\"Venk name\">{{Tumblr|jordandwhiteqna|post/125936619085/in-princess-leia-5-who-is-that-battle-scarred-guy|Jordan D.

Pareece broke the news to the princess that the negotiations with Beonel had failed, meaning they had no weapon that could harm the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial-class'' Star Destroyer]] without the Espirion fleet. Astane admitted it was her fault, which made Organa angry, and told all to leave her. Soon thereafter, Organa broadcast a speech to the fleet, asking them to fight even though they had no chance at victory. The Imperial [[warship]] then arrived and engaged the fleet. However, Beonel heard Organa's speech and was touched by her sincerity, so he dispatched the ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', an Espirion [[battleship]], that quickly destroyed the Star Destroyer. A celebration was held aboard the ''Lord Junn'' after, where the Melodic Order performed in person, and Pareece thanked the ''Espirion Multi''{{'s}} [[Unidentified Alder-Espirion captain|female captain]], before asking Beonel if he was worried that the Empire would retaliate against Espirion. He replied that they had nothing big enough to challenge the Espirion military.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\nAfter the celebration ended, Organa returned to the Rebel Alliance to continue the war against the Emperor tyranny, and endorsed Verlaine as a steward to the throne until she returned. Later, Pareece, Astane, Beonel and Verlaine led the Alderaanian fleet from the ''Lord Junn'' in search of a planet to colonize; a \"new Alderaan.\"<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nUwa Pareece was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] with black [[hair]], brown [[eye]]s, and dark skin.
