Originally one of the Emperor's [[Imperial Knight]]s, Chalk was maimed in an accident and consequently fitted with a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] suit of life-preserving [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Armor/Legends|armor]]. He afterward left active service as an Imperial Knight and became the order's [[master armorer]]; in his new post, Chalk crafted the [[Imperial Knight armor|armor]] worn by his fellow Knights. Before [[137 ABY]], [[Elliah Fel]]&mdash;Chalk's sister and the Emperor's [[Marriage/Legends|wife]]&mdash;was [[Rooftop duel|killed]] by the rogue Imperial Knight [[Darth Havok|Eshkar Niin]]. Following his sister's death, Chalk remained close with his niece, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Marasiah Fel]]. However, he betrayed her [[Parent/Legends|father]] and became a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] in the employ of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Morlish Veed]]. The Grand [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] was an [[Imperial officer/Legends|officer]] in the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Krayt]]'s [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Galactic Empire]], an organization opposed by Fel's [[Empire-in-exile]] in the [[Second Imperial Civil War]].\n\nIn 137 ABY, Chalk was with Fel's forces on the [[fortress world]] of [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]], and he constructed a suit of life-preserving armor for [[Azlyn Rae]], an Imperial Knight who had been gravely injured during a [[Battle on Had Abbadon|battle]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Had Abbadon/Legends|Had Abbadon]]. When the Emperor soon after went to the planet [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] to [[Mission to Agamar|negotiate]] an [[Alliance (Second Imperial Civil War)|alliance]] with the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]], Chalk informed Veed of the meeting's location. The Emperor was subsequently [[Operation: Thunderstroke|attacked]] by a [[First Sith Imperial Strikeforce|Sith&ndash;Imperial strike force]] put together by the Grand Moff, but he managed to escape Agamar with his life. Fel remained unaware of Chalk's betrayal and appointed him as the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]], which gave Chalk access to Imperial secrets, some of which he passed on to Veed. When an Imperial [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] captured the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lady]] [[Darth Maladi]], Chalk had her [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] on Bastion and brought Fel to see her after she, in an apparently crazed state, requested an audience with the Emperor.\n\nMaladi claimed to no longer serve [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt and offered to create a deadly [[Omega Red|pathogen]] that Fel could use against the Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]]&mdash;albeit with high civilian casualties&mdash;and Chalk urged Fel to accept her offer. When Krayt unleashed his devastating [[Darth Krayt's Sith trooper|Sith trooper]] [[Army/Legends|army]] on the Empire-in-exile and its allies during an [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|evacuation]] of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi's]] [[Hidden Temple (Sith&ndash;Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]], Chalk reiterated his advice, and the Emperor deferred to his wisdom. During an [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|attack]] on Krayt's throneworld of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Fel prepared to unleash the pathogen onto the enemy [[Capital/Legends|capital]], but he was halted and killed by the Imperial Knight [[Antares Draco]], who had sworn an oath to end his Emperor's life if Fel ever succumbed to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. The allies nevertheless won the battle and consequently the war, and at [[Funeral of Roan Fel|Fel's funeral]], Chalk delivered a eulogy and announced that [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] would be unified under a new [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Dealing with loss===\n{{Quote|I will need your counsel on our meeting on Agamar, old friend.

With the design complete, Rae [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|sparred]] with fellow Knight [[Ganner Krieg]] in Bastion's [[Imperial Knights quarters]] to become more comfortable [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|fighting]] in her new armor, and Chalk and the Emperor looked on. Fel had recently agreed to [[Mission to Agamar|meet]] with representatives of the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]] on the planet [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] to negotiate an [[Alliance (Second Imperial Civil War)|alliance]] against Krayt's forces, and he sought Chalk's counsel regarding the meeting.

Marasiah, Rae, and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Rasi Tuum]] were stranded planet-side,<ref name=\"monster4\" /> and the Princess was afterward kidnapped by the Sith. Rae and Tuum were able to steal a [[Sith&ndash;Imperial attack ship]] and return to Bastion.<ref name=\"extremes2\">[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]]</ref>\n\nAs the [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] approached the Imperial fortress world, Chalk, [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Shado Vao]], and Imperial Knight Masters Krieg, [[Antares Draco]], and [[Treis Sinde]] were roused from their [[Sleep/Legends|sleep]] by alarms. They all rushed to a landing platform, where Chalk unsuccessfully attempted to contact the ship. He suspected that it might be [[Pilot/Legends|piloted]] by Sith who had [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] proper clearance codes out of a captured Imperial Knight. Rae contacted Krieg via [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], however, and Chalk ordered Bastion's defensive [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] batteries to cease firing on the ship. When Rae and Tuum landed, a furious Draco berated them for not having brought Marasiah with them. The Emperor contacted Chalk at that moment and summoned everyone present to [[Roan Fel's quarters|his quarters]], and Chalk put an end to the unfolding argument by relaying the news. Inside his quarters, Fel revealed that his sources had told him Marasiah had been taken to the Sith world of [[Korriban]].<ref name=\"extremes2\" /> Draco, Krieg, and Vao were able to soon after [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|rescue]] her, but Draco was himself captured by the Sith in the process.<ref name=\"Legacy 50\" />\n\n[[138 ABY|Shortly afterward]], Fel named Chalk the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]]<ref name=\"Legacy War 1\" /> and the head of Bastion security.<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" /> Chalk contacted the [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]] and asked if their spies had any news of Draco, but they had heard nothing. Chalk relayed as much to Marasiah when she sought her uncle out on one of Bastion's landing platforms during a [[Water/Legends|snowfall]]. He planned to make further inquiries, however. After the two reminisced together about Elliah Fel, Chalk expressed his regrets that his intelligence duties prevented him from attending an upcoming [[Imperial Knight remembrance ceremony|ceremony]] being held for Draco and the Imperial Knights who had died on Agamar.<ref name=\"Legacy War 1\" /> Around the same [[Time/Legends|time]], [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Intelligence]] informed Chalk that an Imperial [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] had found the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lady]] [[Darth Maladi]] lying [[Coma/Legends|comatose]] in a derelict vessel near the planet [[Vinsoth/Legends|Vinsoth]], and Chalk arranged for her to be secretly transported to Bastion's [[Imperial Dungeons]]. When Maladi awoke, she appeared to be in a mentally fragile state and began to ramble about a pathogen called [[Omega Red]] that could wipe out all life it touched. She also requested an audience with the Emperor.<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" />\n\n===Devil on a shoulder===\n{{Quote|Did you ''feel'' it, your Majesty? The ''purity'' of its hate!

Chalk looked on as Fel held a [[Holocomm/Legends|holocomm]] conversation with Imperial Knight [[Rand Ko]], who was leading Fel-loyal [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] in a [[Battle of Borosk (138 ABY)|battle]] on the planet [[Borosk/Legends|Borosk]]. Ko reported that the battle was lost just before the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] connection died, and Fel vocally rued the amount of manpower that Krayt possessed. Chalk thus brought Fel to the Imperial Dungeons and revealed to him the Sith [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]]. A half-crazed Maladi requested safe haven from Krayt, whom she had previously plotted against, and offered to create Omega Red to the Emperor in exchange for the head of [[Cade Skywalker]], a former Jedi who had mentally attacked her with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and left her in her current mental state. Chalk and Fel discussed the idea of using the pathogen, and Fel repeatedly dismissed it as too barbaric an act even after several suggestions from Chalk to use it on Korriban and end the war. The two then left the dungeons, and the Emperor ordered Chalk to tell no one of Maladi's capture.<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" />\n\n[[File:Shoulderdevil.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chalk's manipulations contributed to the Emperor's resolve to use Omega Red against the Sith.]]\nAs Head of Bastion security, Chalk discovered that [[Morrigan Corde|Nyna Calixte]], the Director of Imperial Intelligence for Krayt's Empire, was a spy working for Fel and had given him advanced warning of the ambush on Agamar. Chalk contacted Morlish Veed and relayed the information to him, which prompted Veed to attack Calixte in her [[Nyna Calixte's apartment|apartment]].<ref name=\"Legacy War 2\" /> As the war progressed, Fel committed a [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] to the [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|defense]] of the Jedi's [[Hidden Temple (Sith&ndash;Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]] from Krayt's forces.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 3]]''</ref> The battle saw Krayt reveal his secret [[Army/Legends|army]] of [[Darth Krayt's Sith trooper|Sith troopers]] and wreak havoc on the Empire-in-exile and its allies, which prompted Fel to worry that Bastion would be their next target. With their allies en route to the Empire-in-exile's fortress world, Chalk and Fel made their way to the Imperial Dungeons, and Chalk attempted to console the distraught Emperor. A determined Fel ordered Maladi to create Omega Red.<ref name=\"Legacy War 4\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 4]]''</ref>\n\nAntares Draco was among the allies who returned to Bastion, as he had been [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|frozen]] in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and delivered to Cade Skywalker by the Sith after revealing the location of the Hidden Temple under torture. Chalk and Sinde debriefed him upon his return home. A captured [[Unidentified Sith trooper (Taivas)|Sith trooper]] was also with the fleet, and, as it was examined by a [[Unidentified Imperial doctor|doctor]] in a Bastion operating theater, Chalk, Fel, Sinde, Jedi Master [[Tili Qua]], and [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]] of the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]] looked on. The [[Trooper/Legends|trooper]] revealed that its will&mdash;as well as the will of every member of the Sith trooper army&mdash;was linked to Krayt's own will through the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and then promptly died. Chalk quietly urged Fel to use Omega Red against Krayt's Sith and to launch an attack on their throneworld of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], else he and his allies would be unable to stand against the Sith trooper army. Fel agreed and told Chalk to keep Omega Red's existence a secret. The Emperor was able to convince Stazi and the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi Council]] to go ahead with the [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|attack]], and, as the allied fleets made their way to Coruscant, Chalk stood with Fel on the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of the [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Jagged Fel (starship)|''Jagged Fel'']]. Sinde, Marasiah, and Draco were also with them, as the Emperor wanted to be surrounded by those who were most loyal to him.<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 5]]''</ref>\n\nThe ''Jagged Fel'' and the rest of the allied fleets arrived in the [[Coruscant system/Legends|Coruscant system]] just as the throneworld's [[Orbit/Legends|orbital]] defenses were brought down by an advanced [[Cade Skywalker's strike team|strike team]] led by Skywalker. During the ensuing [[Space warfare|space battle]], Fel and Draco left the bridge<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\" /> and made their way to an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]]. When Fel insisted on using Omega Red to defeat Krayt in spite of the billions of innocent lives it would claim, Draco killed his Emperor in a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] duel, fulfilling an oath that every Imperial Knight made to end the Emperor's life if he were ever to fall to the dark side of the Force. Skywalker, meanwhile, killed Krayt on the planet's surface, and, when the Sith troopers subsequently went insane, the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|naval forces]] of Krayt's Empire fled from the planet and ceded control to the allies. With the capital won and the Sith in hiding, the war was over. In the battle's aftermath, a [[Funeral of Roan Fel|funeral]] was held on Coruscant for the Emperor. Chalk delivered the eulogy as Fel's body was [[Cremation/Legends|cremated]], praising the Emperor's resolve to defeat the Sith and his devotion to the citizens of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Chalk also announced the formation of a [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]]&mdash;Admiral Stazi, Jedi Master [[K'Kruhk]], and the newly-crowned Empress Marasiah&mdash;that intended to lead a unified [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 6]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|She's a ''Sith''&mdash;and one of their most practiced liars and manipulators.

Following his accident, he received extensive scarring and was fitted with cybernetic armor. Chalk believed that the accident was caused by the will of the Force so that he might go on to develop armor for the Imperial Knights. He was very dedicated to his job as master armorer, referring to the armor he built as his \"creations.\" He felt that the armor that Rawk had crafted for Azlyn Rae was an unrefined design not befitting an Imperial Knight, regardless of some parts of it that he found impressive.<ref name=\"vongspawn\" />\n\nWhen Chalk was appointed the head of Imperial Intelligence, he displayed similar dedication to his new post.

Years after she was murdered, he still regretted her passing and maintained a close relationship with Marasiah Fel, his niece and Elliah's daughter. Chalk believed that she embodied the same qualities that her [[Parent/Legends|mother]] had.<ref name=\"Legacy War 1\" /> Chalk's opinions were respected and trusted by the Emperor, who felt that Chalk understood the Jedi, and who sought his counsel in preparation for a meeting with representatives of the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"vongspawn\" />\n\nCounsel that Chalk provided for Fel during the later stages of the war saw him advocate the use of Omega Red&mdash;a deadly pathogen that had the power to wipe out all life it touched&mdash;on the Sith world of Korriban.
