On [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], Ninx owned and operated his famous [[Spacebarn]], an enormous facility where [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] could repair and modify their [[Starship/Legends|ships]]. The only access to the Spacebarn was through a cleverly-disguised tunnel called [[The Chute]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Shugninx.jpg|thumb|left|Ninx in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]].]]\n\nNinx started out working for mechanic [[Bammy Decree/Legends|Bammy Decree]], and it is likely that he learnt the trade from the [[Human/Legends|human]]. When helping Decree rebuild the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Stellar Envoy'']], Ninx sought out the fence Masel, who supplied him with a new [[Droid brain/Legends|Droid brain]]. Unknown to Ninx, this was a ploy by Masel which resulted in the brain activating a cargo of buzz droids, which caused the explosion of an [[Acclamator-class assault ship]]. Ninx would later do more work on the Envoy, years later when it was known as the ''Millennium Falcon''.\nNinx himself was a master mechanic, and probably could have found work in the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] had he not been a \"half-breed\", meaning he was the son of a Human and a nonhuman: although his father was a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]], his mother was one of the last [[Theelin/Legends|Theelin]]. This resulted in his mostly Human appearance except for blue and green mottling on his skin, and one thumb and two fingers on each of his hands. Given the prejudices of the Galactic Empire, he was fortunate to find work on Nar Shaddaa.\n\nThe Spacebarn was located near the [[Corellian Sector (Nar Shaddaa)/Legends|Corellian Sector]]. He made fast friends with many smugglers, including [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], [[Salla Zend]], [[Roa]], and [[Mako Spince]] among many others. For a time, he worked alongside a [[Tintinna]] named [[Kit]]. Ninx's only rules in the Spacebarn were:\n\n*Anything was available to use, so long as whoever used it put it back or compensated for damage.\n*Pay promptly for the use of his or his techs' services.\n*No intoxicating substances of any kind were ever allowed.\n\nGiven Ninx's amiable personality and skill as a mechanic, he was quite popular. He was very involved with the defensive planning prior to the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]], and helped many smugglers outfit their ships with additional weaponry and shields. After the battle when Han Solo left, Ninx was one of the few who did not have a grudge against Solo.\n\nWhen [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] returned in a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] body, Han and [[Leia Organa Solo]] returned to Nar Shaddaa and met Ninx, who helped repair the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] in the Spacebarn. Violence erupted in the Spacebarn with the arrival of [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], and Solo collaterally destroyed one of Ninx's prized ships during his escape. When Solo left Nar Shaddaa this time, Ninx did indeed have a sour taste in his mouth.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*''[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)|''A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale'' webstrip]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*[[Dark Empire 3|''Dark Empire'' 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Empire 4|''Dark Empire'' 4]]\n*[[Dark Empire 5|''Dark Empire'' 5]]\n*[[Dark Empire 6|''Dark Empire'' 6]]\n*[[Dark Empire (audio)|''Dark Empire'' audio drama]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire II]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Shug Ninx}}\n*[[Dark Empire endnotes|''Dark Empire'' endnotes]]\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*{{InsiderCite|67|Who's Who in the Max Rebo Band}}\n*{{FFCite|89|German Edition - SHU1-4, ''Shug Ninx''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels]]''<!--p. 25-->\n*{{FFCite|93|BYS2, ''Byss''}} {{Po}}\n*{{FFCite|133|INT2, ''Starlight Intruder''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|greedo|Greedo|id=eu|archivedate=20100414132600}}\n*{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Han|archivedate=20110903234809}}\n*[[\"Millennium Falcon\" SpecPlate]]\n*[[\"Millennium Falcon\" TechPlate]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Shug Ninx\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ninx, Shug}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Near-Human Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Theelins]]"}}}]}}}}
