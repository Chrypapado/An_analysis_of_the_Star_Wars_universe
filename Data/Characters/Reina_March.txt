March was found in the presence of [[Whimper Save]] and [[Dannl Faytonni/Legends|Dannl Faytonni]].\n\n==Biography==\nReina March was the leader of anarchist organization called [[Edge-9]]. Edge-9 claims the destruction of the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] government and abolition of aristocracy and was known for appealing its political demands with violent means. Of course, not all members actively supported violence, but the behavior of Edge-9 also included bombing terrorism against multipurpose facilities such as police. The anarchist of Edge-9 planned the blast of the [[Senate Building]] in the past, and secretly plotted a [[Bomb/Legends|bomb]] along the pipeline extending from the extreme point, but this plan failed.\n\nMarch was a particularly radical faction within the organization, involved in the planning and execution of numerous violent acts. Even after the new order was enforced, the organization had survived, but the members gradually became less and, on the other hand, changed into a more fanatic group.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]''\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|reinamarch|March, Reina|archivedate=20100202123130}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Reina March\n|nl=Reina March\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:March, Reina}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
