He was a demon of a fighter.|[[Callista Ming]]|Children of the Jedi (novel)}}\n'''Geith Eris''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who was trained on the second [[Chu'unthor (Clone Wars)|''Chu'unthor'']] by [[Djinn Altis]] in the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He wore a single gold earring.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] and native of [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]] with rust-[[Color/Legends|colored]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], Geith was recruited to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi Order]] on Bespin by [[Callista Ming]], with whom he fell in love. Geith and Callista were amongst the Jedi who hid from the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]] on [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]]. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] [[Plett]] dispatched them in a [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-wing]] to infiltrate the ''[[Eye of Palpatine]]''. Once aboard, they realized that they couldn't stop the Eye of Palpatine alone. However, the two Jedi disagreed on how to get help. Ultimately, Geith convinced Callista to let him attempt to escape the ''Eye of Palpatine'' in a [[GAT-12 Skipray Blastboat|Skipray Blastboat]], leaving Callista behind to try to disable the ship. Geith surmised that he had figured out the pattern on which the ''Eye of Palpatine''{{'s}} automated defenses fired. Unfortunately for Geith, he was wrong and was struck by an unanticipated shot from the ''Eye of Palpatine''{{'s}} automated defenses. That unexpected shot sent his Skipray Blastboat into an asteroid and Geith's ship was destroyed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Clone Wars: No Prisoners]]'' {{1stID|Eris|[[The Clone Wars: No Prisoners (audiobook)|''The Clone Wars: No Prisoners'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[The Clone Wars: No Prisoners (audiobook)|''The Clone Wars: No Prisoners'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel]]''\n*''[[Imperial Commando: 501st]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{Journal|14|Murder in Slushtime}} {{C|\"Callista Ming\" capsule}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*''[[Death Star Owner's Technical Manual]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Geith Eris\n|pt=Geith\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eris, Geith}}\n[[Category:Altisian Jedi]]\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge victims]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
