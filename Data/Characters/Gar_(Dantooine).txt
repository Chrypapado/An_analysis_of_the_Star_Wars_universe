He was friendly to the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], but impatient with their inaction when it came to defending the Dantooinian farmers. Because of the increasing hostility of the native [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] and attacks by [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] raiders, Gar finally set out to present a petition personally at the Enclave, entreating the Jedi to deal with both problems.\n\nIt is possible that he met [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] during his time on Dantooine outside the Jedi Enclave.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGar was a sensible person, treating the Jedi with respect and kindness. While impatient for the Council to take action, he did think about nearly every context of the situation such as [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] [[Darth Malak|Malak's]] attempts to exterminate the Jedi. When Gar told Revan about what happened to [[Jon (farmer)|Jon's]] daughter [[Ilsa]], and [[Canderous Ordo]] commented that Jon should have protected her better, Gar reacted angrily, calling Ordo a beast.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOn the [[Xbox]] version of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', Gar appears as an old, gray haired man, yet on the [[Personal computer|PC]] version, he appears as a younger, red headed man.\n\nThe player has the option of telling Gar that the Jedi Council has sent for him. This option will result in no alignment change, and Gar will not be seen afterwards.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gar (Mensch)\n|es=Gar (Dantooine)\n|pl=Gar\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u0440 (\u0414\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0438\u043d)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
