I know what you seek.|The Eye of Webbish Bog, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition}}\nThe '''Eye of Webbish Bog''' was a [[spider]]-like being that existed on the [[planet]] [[Mustafar]]. It was locked in symbiosis with a [[Unidentified blind giant|blind giant]], living within a lake near the [[Corvax Fen]]. It encountered the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]] when Vader was punished by [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] for [[Gender|his]] past failures. While Vader tried to survive and fight against [[Ochi|Ochi of Bestoon]], a [[Sith assassin]] sent by his [[Sith Master]], Vader awakened the Eye through [[the Force]] and went to meet him, an encounter in which the Eye attacked Vader with questions and inquiries about his past before giving him [[Vader's wayfinder|a]] [[Sith wayfinder]] to find the hidden [[Sith]] world of [[Exegol]].\n\nYears after Vader's [[Battle of Endor|death]], the Eye of Webbish Bog met with [[Supreme Leader]] [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]] from the [[First Order]], who was Vader's [[Reproduction|grandson]], during the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the First Order and the [[Resistance]]. After [[Mission to Mustafar (First Order)|slaughtering]] the [[Alazmec of Winsit]] with his [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|forces]], Ren encountered the Eye, who claimed to have been tasked with guardianship of Vader's wayfinder by Vader himself, and directed the Supreme Leader to the [[Sith artifact|artifact]]'s location after considering him worthy of having earned the wayfinder for destroying its protectors.\n\n==Biography==\n===Encounter with Darth Vader===\nSometime after the [[Duel on Cloud City]], the Eye of the Webbish Bog was accidentally awakened by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] on [[Mustafar]] as Vader was fighting against [[Ochi|Ochi of Bestoon]], a [[Sith assassin]] send by [[Darth Sidious]], [[Gender|his]] [[Sith Master]], to [[Death|kill]] Vader for his past failures. Upon trying to approach Ochi to discover the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]]'s plans, Vader was called up by the Eye of Webbish Bog through [[the Force]], who demanded to know who was shouting before asking who was demanding answers so insistently. Ochi felt the Eye's presence and noted that Vader had used the Force despite that the Emperor had forbidden him from using it to survive, but Vader stated that the Eye was the one calling for him from a [[cave]]. Ochi tried to prevent Vader from reaching the Eye by blocking the cave's entrance with [[Stone|rock]]s, but Vader was able to make it into the cave. The Eye then told Vader from afar that he didn't know which questions he wanted to ask nor understand the answers he would receive, proceeding to mock him by arrogantly saying that the [[Sith]]'s fury couldn't solve the riddles of the Eye of Webbish Bog.<ref name=\"DV 7\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 7]]</ref>\n\nWhile Ochi left [[Darth]] Vader for dead at the cave as no one was known from ever returning of meeting the Eye of Webbish Bog, some [[lava flea]]s attacked Vader as the Eye asked him if he was a fierce warrior or why he thought he could sweep away all his enemies so easily, to which Vader killed a huge [[Magma|lava]] flea and asked in turn why the Eye had called him up, leading the Eye to question him back if he really thought he was calling him or choosing him for a special destiny instead of many other [[Force-sensitive]]s with the same abilities as him, triggering Vader with flashbacks of his former [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Emperor Palpatine and his [[Reproduction|son]] [[Luke Skywalker]] to reminder him of his destiny as the [[Chosen One]]. The Eye asked Vader that had he been given the option to choose if he would have chosen to be chosen or to make his own choice while it sic a [[roggwart]] against the Sith Lord, who easily killed him with a skin piece from a lava flea. Furious, Vader demanded the Eye to know if it served his Sith Master, desiring to know what Sidious was secretly building and where, threatening the Eye to tell him or he would choose to destroy it, opening up the chamber where the Eye was resting above the [[Unidentified blind giant|blind giant]]<ref name=\"DV 8\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 8|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 8]]</ref> it was locked in symbiosis with.<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\" />\n\nThe Eye of Webbish Bog laughed at Vader and asked him what he needed or wanted to know and if he knew or remembered what he wanted and needed, triggering Vader with flashbacks of when he [[Duel in Palpatine's office|saved]] Darth Sidious' life, when Sidious told him that Luke Skywalker was the offspring of Anakin Skywalker and when he offered Luke at [[Cloud City]] to join and aid him on overthrowing the Emperor. The Eye then requested Vader to search through his feelings to discover. Furious with the Eye, Vader punched hard a rock platform from which he was grabbing, bringing it down and sending him into the lava pool where the Eye and the giant were resting, where Vader warned the Eye that he had enough with its lies and tricks and demanded it to give him what he came for. Once more, the Eye asked him the same questions but used the Force to change the giant's appearance into that of Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker and Darth Sidious, asking Vader if anyone would care about what he chooses if he was chosen, to which Vader walked towards the Eye and proclaimed that he had made his decision and that the Eye would care for it. The Eye then laughed and made the giant emerge from the lava pool to give Vader a [[Sith wayfinder]] while musing that while Vader had come for answers, it had given him questions and would leave him with one more, which consisted whether he believed he had passed the test it had given to him or if he failed it. Eventually, Vader left the cave.<ref name=\"DV 8\" />\n\n===Encounter with Kylo Ren===\n{{Quote|I must warn you, our fiery planet burns away deception.

The Eye presented itself to Kylo Ren and told him that he had what he sought. Ren tried to perform a [[mind trick]] on the Eye so it would give him the wayfinder immediately, but the Eye laughed at Ren and informed him that it was immune to Force trick, noting that Vader tasked it to guard the [[Sith artifact]].<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\" />\n\nThe Eye of Webbish Bog then warned Kylo Ren that Mustafar burned deception and that he would encounter his true self had he continued with the path he had established for himself, given that he had been after the wayfinder for a while. Noting that Ren was silently growing impatient, the Eye stated that in accordance to Vader's wishes, he had earned his wayfinder by defeating its protectors, leading the blind giant to raise its enormous hand from the water and point out toward a small island in the lake. As Ren examined the wayfinder, the Eye informed Ren that the wayfinder would guide him through the [[Unknown Regions]] to the hidden Sith [[Planet|world]] of [[Exegol]], where Palpatine was hiding. After staring at the wayfinder for a while, an startled Ren turned around only to see that the Eye of Webbish Bog and the blind giant were gone, slipped back beneath the lake's surface so like if nothing lived within it at all.<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|That was a character that was designed very early on in the day. Jake Lunt [Davies], who's one of my concept designers, we were all playing around with this idea and talking about it and he did this drawing and J.J. saw it and went, 'That is amazing.' It was one of those moments where it was like, 'This has to be in the movie.' So we actually did build it and we took it to a place called Black Park in the UK, which is close to Pinewood Studios, where we shot it in a lake on location, and that sequence exists. Unfortunately it didn't make it to the movie story, plot-wise, etc. It was a fully practical character shot in a location, and it is amazing.|Neal Scanlan, on the Eye of Webbish Bog|url=https://collider.com/rise-of-skywalker-eye-of-webbish-bog-scene-was-filmed-why-it-was-cut/}}\nThe Eye of Webbish Bog appeared in [[Rae Carson]]'s ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]'', the novelization of the [[2019]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']], the final installment of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[sequel trilogy]].<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\" />\n\nAccording to creature and special make-up effects creative supervisor [[Neal Scanlan]], creature concept designer [[Jake Lunt Davies]] designed the Eye early on the development of ''The Rise of Skywalker''.
