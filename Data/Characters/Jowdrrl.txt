Over a [[2 BBY/Legends|century later]], the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] turned Kashyyyk into a [[slave world]], and Jowdrrl joined a [[Wookiee underground resistance movement|resistance movement]] that opposed the Empire's occupation of the planet.

They took up residence within the [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|freighter]], and Jowdrrl analyzed and discovered several flaws with the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} systems. She and Dryanta then modified the vessel so as to eliminate several blind spots that the ship's [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] suffered while in flight. When Chewbacca learned that Solo had been kidnapped by the [[Yevetha]]n [[Duskhan League]] and thus prepared to hastily depart the planet, he reluctantly allowed Jowdrrl, Dryanta, Shoran, and Lumpawarrump to accompany him on a [[Mission to the Koornacht Cluster|rescue mission]].\n\nThe [[First Wookiee Expeditionary Force|strike team]] took the ''Millennium Falcon'' to a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler's]] [[Esau's Ridge|sanctuary]] on [[Tholatin]] to gather information about their enemy, and Jowdrrl used their time to modify the freighter's [[Quad laser cannon/Legends|quad laser cannons]].

The Wookiees then bundled the Humans into [[quulaar]] sacks and, carrying them, climbed across Wroshyr trees to Rwookrrorro, where they were met by Chewbacca's [[Parent/Legends|father]] [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]] and several other Wookiees. Chewbacca and his companions remained in Rwookrrorro for several days, during which time he and Mallatobuck [[Wedding of Chewbacca and Mallatobuck|wed]].

Chewbacca borrowed the ''Millennium Falcon'' from Solo in that year and visited Kashyyyk to oversee the coming-of-age [[Hrrtayyk ceremony/Legends|hrrtayyk ceremony]] of his and Mallatobuck's son, [[Lumpawaroo/Legends|Lumpawarrump]], and he left the [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] in the care of Jowdrrl and Dryanta after landing it on Rwookrrorro's [[Landing Platform Thyss]]. The ship and its adventures were famous throughout the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]], and Jowdrrl and Dryanta were both honored to leave their homes and live aboard it for the duration of Chewbacca's stay. Streams of tourists from across the planet came to see the ''Millennium Falcon'' and have [[Hologram/Legends|holograms]] of themselves taken beside it, but Chewbacca's two cousins kept the freighter sealed and arranged for the landing platform to be watched around the [[Chronometer/Legends|chronometer]]. In the morning and afternoon, when visitors were permitted, either Jowdrrl or Dryanta stood watch to ensure that the tourists remained more than an [[Limb/Legends|arm's]] length away from the ship's [[Hull/Legends|hull]]. During the several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] that the ''Millennium Falcon'' was in their care, Jowdrrl studied the freighter closely and discovered what she believed to be several weaknesses. Dryanta, a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], helped her devise improvements, and the two made several modifications to the ship's systems.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" />\n\n[[File:Melfal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jowdrrl made several modifications to the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]\nAs the [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpits]] of YT-1300 freighters were offset to starboard and allowed very little visibility to aft and to port, Jowdrrl covered the [[Viewport/Legends|viewports]] of the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} loading hatches and [[Quad laser cannon/Legends|quad laser cannon]] turrets with custom-fitted [[optical transducer panel]]s. The nearly transparent [[Sensor/Legends|sensors]] routed their output to [[Viewscreen/Legends|flatscreen displays]] in the cockpit, which eliminated most of the ship's blind spots. One day before the final test of Lumpawarrump's hrrtayyk, Jowdrrl and Dryanta worked through the night to finish their modifications, and they had less than an [[Standard hour/Legends|hour]] of work left to do the next day when Mallatobuck informed them that Chewbacca was returning to the ''Millennium Falcon'' for a rush departure from the planet. He had just learned that Solo had been taken [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] in the [[Koornacht Cluster/Legends|Koornacht Cluster]] by the [[Duskhan League]]&mdash;the [[Yevetha]]n government that had recently come into [[Black Fleet Crisis|conflict]] with the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], the Rebel Alliance's successor state&mdash;and he had cut his son's hrrtayyk short to honor his life debt and mount a rescue attempt.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" />\n\nJowdrrl and Dryanta worked to complete their task and render the ship [[Realspace/Legends|spaceworthy]], but Chewbacca arrived sooner than they anticipated. He was furious that the ship was not ready for flight, but Jowdrrl and Mallatobuck were able to calm him down. As Chewbacca's wife and son left to prepare his things, Jowdrrl showed her cousin the modifications she had made, and he grudgingly approved of them. She wished to join him as a partner on his [[Mission to the Koornacht Cluster|rescue mission]], but he refused and initiated the ship's preflight procedure. However, Dryanta and Shoran were standing on the landing platform and wearing hunting [[Bandolier/Legends|bandoleers]], and when Chewbacca left the ship and demanded to know what was going on, Jowdrrl continued the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} preflight procedure. Mallatobuck presented to Chewbacca the rest of his crew, and when Shoran and Dryanta assured him that all three of his cousins were willing to risk their lives to help him, Chewbacca relented. After Jowdrrl was joined by Dryanta and Shoran inside the ''Millennium Falcon'', Lumpawarrump arrived and also wanted to come along, in hopes that he could prove his worth to Chewbacca and pass his hrrtayyk at his father's side. Chewbacca accepted him, and with his [[First Wookiee Expeditionary Force|strike team]] assembled, took the ''Millennium Falcon'' away from Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" />\n\n===Into the Koornacht Cluster===\n{{Quotetrans|I just had visitors.

The [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] [[Formayj]] required several days to gather information on the Koornacht [[Star cluster/Legends|Cluster]], and while the Wookiees waited, they tested and installed a [[firecracker mine]] launcher and a [[hull-cutting ring]] in place of the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]].<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" /> Jowdrrl also installed [[auto-tracking fire controller]]s for the quad turrets in the ship's cockpit<ref name=\"Hero's Trial\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref> and helped Lumpawarrump practice his fighting skills. After they had been at the ridge for a week, Formayj acquired and sold to Chewbacca a navigational map of the Koornacht Cluster, a recording of an address made to the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]] by the Yevethan [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Nil Spaar]], and several other intelligence documents that provided data on the Yevetha. The information had come from the clandestine [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]] agency [[Alpha Blue]], who had become aware of the Wookiees' mission and were covertly working to support it. Inside the ''Millennium Falcon'', Jowdrrl and the others watched a forty-[[Standard hour/Legends|hour]]-old recording of Spaar addressing members of the New Republic on the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet's]] [[Channel 81]]. The planet [[N'zoth]] was visible in the recording's background, and it became the Wookiees' destination as they lifted off from Tholatin.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" />\n\n[[File:Jowdrrlinthetrees.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jowdrrl]]\nJowdrrl sat in the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} upper quad turret, with Lumpawarrump below her in the lower turret, as the freighter reached the outskirts of the [[N'zoth system/Legends|N'zoth system]]. Chewbacca soon called everyone into the cockpit to study new data that had just been sent to him by Formayj: a [[New Republic Fleet Intelligence]] assault plan for an [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] that included marked locations of [[Prison/Legends|cell blocks]] and points on the hull that could effectively be breached. The ''Executor''-class Star [[Dreadnaught|Dreadnought]] [[Intimidator (Executor-class)|''Pride of Yevetha'']], which Chewbacca recognized from the earlier recording, was one of many ships [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] N'zoth, and he calculated the orbital data required to [[Precision hyperspace jump|micro-jump]] to within one thousand [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] of the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]]. Jowdrrl then returned to the quad batteries, now with Dryanta at her side, and Shoran launched a string of firecracker [[Mine/Legends|mines]] as the ''Millennium Falcon'' executed its micro-jump. It emerged from [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] off the [[Star/Legends|Star]] [[Destroyer/Legends|Destroyer's]] starboard bow, and the [[Cronau radiation/Legends|cronau radiation]] produced by its jump was masked by light and [[Radiation/Legends|radiation]] from the exploding mines. The sensors of the Yevethan defense grid were overwhelmed by the explosions, which allowed Chewbacca to pilot the ''Millennium Falcon'' inside the ''Pride of Yevetha''{{'s}} [[Deflector shield/Legends|shields]] and launch more mines. Yevethan [[D-type fighter|starfighters]] pursued them, but Jowdrrl and Dryanta opened fire from the quad batteries. At least one fighter was destroyed.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" />\n\nAfter Chewbacca landed the freighter on the Star Destroyer's hull, Jowdrrl was surprised to see the Yevethan fighters stop firing on them. Chewbacca instructed her to cease firing herself and, after the hull-cutting ring burned through the side of the Star Destroyer, he charged inside the ''Pride of Yevetha'' with Shoran at his side. Lumpawarrump relieved Jowdrrl in the quad turret, and she took up guard position of the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} hatch. She was bewildered when nine Yevethan guards walked by her location and did not notice her, and when she contacted Lumpawarrump and Dryanta on her [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], they reported that dozens of Yevethan starfighters had similarly ignored the ''Millennium Falcon''. The Wookiees were ignorant of the fact that their presence had been [[Mind trick/Legends#Force illusion|disguised]] in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by [[Enara]], a [[Fallanassi/Legends|Fallanassi]] adept of the [[White Current]] who was one of Solo's fellow prisoners. Shoran was soon killed by Yevethan guards, and Chewbacca contacted Dryanta for assistance. Lumpawarrump raced out of the ship first, however, and insisted on accompanying Dryanta. Jowdrrl saw the determination in his eyes and did not argue; Dryanta and Lumpawarrump then left her alone with the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" />\n\nJowdrrl received no further trouble. Dryanta returned with Shoran's corpse, and Jowdrrl was contacted by Chewbacca soon after with instructions to prepare the ''Millennium Falcon'' for a retrieval at a flight deck that was directly forward of her current position. She sealed the hatch and, after receiving confirmation from Chewbacca, piloted the ship to the flight deck and retrieved Chewbacca, Lumpawarrump, and a rescued Solo. The ''Millennium Falcon'' then blasted off under the cover of more firecracker mines, and Chewbacca piloted it toward the nearby [[New Republic Fifth Fleet|New Republic Fifth Battle Group]]. They were permitted to board the starship [[Intrepid (Endurance-class)|''Intrepid'']] after Chewbacca's [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]] hails were recognized by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], a Human friend of Solo's who was aboard the [[Endurance-class fleet carrier|fleet carrier]]. Solo was taken to a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]] and Shoran to the ship's morgue; Skywalker and the surviving Wookiees visited Solo in the [[Medcenter/Legends|medical ward]] as he rested in between [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] sessions. Their presence there drew considerable attention. Chewbacca later prepared the ''Millennium Falcon'' for use in an upcoming New Republic [[Battle of N'zoth|strike]] against N'zoth, but Lumpawarrump&mdash;now called Lumpawaroo after completing his hrrtayyk aboard the ''Pride of Yevetha'' and earning a new name&mdash;joined Solo on a [[Hospital ship/Legends|medical frigate]], leaving the ''Millennium Falcon'' short one crewmember.

The Wookiee [[Ralrracheen]] eulogized as the group stood around a circular wooden table. After the [[Funeral/Legends|services]] were completed, the table was covered with foodstuffs, and the guests ate, drank, and recalled memories of Chewbacca. Jowdrrl and several other members of her family approached Solo, who sat alone and devastated, and the Human was presented with gifts by Mallatobuck and Lumpawaroo. Lumpawaroo and his cousin [[Lowbacca]] had been selected to assume Chewbacca's life debt, and Jowdrrl and Dryanta intended to arrange a farewell feast for them before Solo and his [[House of Solo|family]] left Kashyyyk. Jowdrrl wondered when Solo would depart, but the Human refused Lumpawaroo's and Lowbacca's offer&mdash;he was not yet ready to replace Chewbacca, who had been his closest friend. Mallatobuck and Attichitcuk allowed him additional time to grieve, and Solo and his family departed Kashyyyk to continue aiding the New Republic in its [[Yuuzhan Vong War|war]] against the Yuuzhan Vong, who had invaded and were attempting to conquer the galaxy.<ref name=\"Hero's Trial\" />\n\nThroughout four years<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> of devastating warfare, the invaders laid siege to much of the galaxy and even [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|captured]] the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].

Everyone then returned to Rwookrrorro and enjoyed a celebratory feast; there, Lumpawaroo and Lowbacca informed Solo that they would now be assuming Chewbacca's life debt.

Despite her skill, she was not above recognizing the good work that others had done on ship systems.

Jowdrrl plays a sizable role in the book, first being entrusted to take care of the ''Millennium Falcon'' and then joining Chewbacca on a mission to rescue Han Solo from the clutches of the Duskhan League.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" /> In McDowell's initial outline for the novel, Chewbacca returned to Kashyyyk to find a mate and later set out to rescue Solo in a ''Millennium Falcon'' crewed by him and his several wives. When he was told by [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] that Chewbacca already had a family in ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]],<ref name=\"Wasaka Berries\">{{InsiderCite|74|Wasaka Berries and Monster Ships}}</ref> McDowell altered the plotline to center around Chewbacca returning home to participate in his son's coming-of-age ceremony, and to feature Chewbacca's cousins rather than his wives crewing the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" /> Jowdrll has since made cameo appearances in several additional ''Star Wars'' novels,<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" /><ref name=\"Hero's Trial\" /><ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" /> and she received her first and thus far only visual depiction in the [[2000]] [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] issue [[Chewbacca (2000) 1|''Chewbacca'' (2000) 1]].<ref name=\"Chewbacca 1\" /> She is also discussed in several sourcebooks and encyclopedias.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n''Tyrant's Test'' establishes that Jowdrrl, Dryanta, and Shoran are all cousins of Chewbacca, but it does not indicate what their relationships to each other are.<ref name=\"Tyrant's Test\" /> The 2000 novel ''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' identifies Shoran as the cousin of both Jowdrrl and Dryanta,<ref name=\"Hero's Trial\" /> but, to date, no source has elaborated on Jowdrrl and Dryanta's familial connection. ''Star Wars: Chewbacca 1'' does show Jowdrrl indicating that she is attracted to Dryanta, however.<ref name=\"Chewbacca 1\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*''[[Tyrant's Test]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Chewbacca (2000) 1|''Chewbacca'' (2000) 1]] {{Flash}} {{1stp}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Jowdrrl}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|106|Han Solo: The Early Years}}\n*[[\"Millennium Falcon\" SpecPlate]]\n*[[\"Millennium Falcon\" TechPlate]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jowdrrl\n|pl=Jowdrrl\n}}\n\n[[Category:Engineers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Members of the First Wookiee Expeditionary Force]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
