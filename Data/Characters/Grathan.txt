Come embrace the darkness!|Grathan|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Grathan''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] who served the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] against the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He rebelled against the [[Dark Council]] and organized a private base of operations in [[Dromund Kaas]], though his ambition eventually suffered a crippling blow by [[Darth Baras]]'s [[Empire's Wrath|apprentice]].{{Fact}}\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Grathan's trouble, see. Big trouble. Mad scientist type. Likes weapons. Cyborgs. Droids. Ergonomic chairs.|Bryn|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nSome time into the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], Grathan went rogue and declared himself the thirteenth [[Dark Council]] member, with his own power base and sphere of influence within the Sith hierarchy. Although his claim had not been widely recognized, he controlled a substantial private army on [[Dromund Kaas]]. The Dark Council authorized all-out warfare against Grathan and anyone who supported him.{{Fact}}\n\nAfter being driven from the [[Imperial Citadel (Sith Empire)|Citadel]], Lord Grathan holed up in [[Lord Grathan's estate|his estate]] outside Kaas City. His [[Lord Grathan's forces|forces]] there were made up of apprentices, loyal [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Imperial]] troops and [[Cyborg/Legends|cybernetic supersoldiers]] he developed in his secret weapons labs. His cadre of elite [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]] &mdash; some volunteers, others kidnapped and forced into service &mdash; developed a seemingly endless number of [[Battle droid/Legends|war droids]], reducing attrition in Grathan's army to near zero. [[Vereta Fraabaal]] was one of his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentices]].{{Fact}}\n\n{{GameDS}}\nWilling to show Grathan he was not untouchable as he thought, [[Darth Baras]] commanded [[Empire's Wrath|his apprentice]] to invade his estate and assassinate his [[Beelzlit Grathan|son]]. Grathan's [[Cellvanta Grathan|wife]] tried to bargain her son's life for her husband's, but Baras' apprentice eventually slew both mother and son.\n{{Endgame}}\n\nAt some point, Grathan came into possession of the [[Revan's mask|mask]] of [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], which he stored deep within his vaults. He lost it when the [[Order of Revan]] executed a heist on his estate and retrieved the mask, after which it eventually came back into the possession of Revan himself.<ref>{{TORcite|type=general|The Mask of Revan|Dromund Kaas}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLord Grathan first appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', as an enemy during the Sith Warrior storyline on Dromund Kaas. According to conversation files, Grathan's name was originally \"Lord [[Rathari]]\", and his wife and son were Cellvanta Rathari and Beelzlit Rathari respectively. However, the name \"Rathari\" was later used on a Sith Lord on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] instead of him. A character model labeled \"Lord Grathan,\" albeit a default one with no textures or details, is also present with the fully-qualified name of \"npc.\u200blocation.\u200bcompanion.\u200bsith_warrior.\u200bjaesa.\u200blord_grathan\", indicating that Grathan at one point was planned to be involved with the companion missions for [[Jaesa Willsaam]].\n\nLord Grathan's fate is upon player's choice. Players can choose to kill his wife and son (Dark side decision) or spare their lives and kill Lord Grathan himself, letting his son take his place secretly (Light side decision).\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Grathan\n|ru=\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dromund Kaas residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sith Lords of the reconstituted Sith Empire]]\n[[Category:Sith Masters]]"}}}]}}}}
