She was an anti-war activist whose radical beliefs led to her participation in the [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing]] of the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. [[Barriss Offee]], the [[Padawan]] who masterminded the attack, [[Force choke|choked]] Turmond to [[death]] in order to hide Offee's involvement.<ref name=\"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\" /> [[Ahsoka Tano]] was then framed for the murder, before Offee's involvement was discovered.<ref name=\"The Wrong Jedi\">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>\n\nShe was married to the [[Abyssin]] [[Jackar Bowmani]], a munitions expert and foreman who worked at the Jedi Temple. The two lived together in an apartment.<ref name=\"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTurmond was motivated to help bomb the Jedi Temple by the belief that the Jedi were warmongers. Her participation in the attack was to draw attention to what she felt was the hypocrisy of the [[Jedi Order]] during the war. She had no qualms about using murder and terrorism to make a statement on her views. It was for this reason that Barriss Offee used and manipulated Letta to her own ends. Yet, when Offee began to threaten Turmond's life, Turmond was willing to reveal to [[Ahsoka Tano]] of Offee's involvement in the bombing in exchange for her protection, which sadly cost Turmond her own life as she was [[Force choke|choked]] to death by Offee.<ref name=\"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\" />\n\nLetta was also a decent actor in that she faked distress and anger at the Jedi's accusations towards her husband Jakar. However, given that Letta murdered Jakar in such a horrendous and deceptive way and her later revealing it wasn't her idea to feed him [[NM-K reconstitutor|nano-droids]], it's unclear whether or not she ever truly loved him.<ref name=\"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\" />\n\nTurmond had [[color|dark]] hair and tan skin. She had several [[tattoo]]s on her face.<ref name=\"Sabotage\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)|Sabotage}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}\n*{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}} {{C|Appears in a [[hologram]] in flashback(s) only}}\n*{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWE|characters|letta-turmond|Letta Turmond}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|41|Databank A-Z|'Occupier' Tank&ndash;Oola}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{Databank|coruscant|Coruscant|archivedate=20200510123203}}\n*{{Databank|letta-turmond|Letta Turmond|archivedate=20200325193403}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Letta Turmond#kanon\n|es=Letta Turmond\n|fr=Letta Turmond\n|ja=\u30ec\u30c3\u30bf\u30fb\u30bf\u30fc\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\n|ka=\u10da\u10d4\u10e2\u10d0 \u10e2\u10d0\u10e0\u10db\u10dd\u10dc\u10d3\u10d8\n|nl=Letta Turmond\n|pl=Letta Turmond\n|ru=\u041b\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0434/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n|tr=Letta Turmond\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turmond, Letta}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Terrorists]]"}}}]}}}}
