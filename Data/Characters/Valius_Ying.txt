Ying was the [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Oroko]]'', and headed a [[Valius Ying's gang|crew]] of several [[Gangster/Legends|gangsters]]. Once captured by [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] Captain [[Saul Karath]], Ying had his operation back up and running by [[3964 BBY]]. That [[Standard year/Legends|year]], Ying, not normally a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], joined the potentially lucrative search for runaway [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Zayne Carrick]], who was accused of [[Padawan Massacre|murdering]] four of his fellow [[Padawan/Legends|classmates]] on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. Ying and the ''Oroko'' soon tracked down Carrick in the [[Taris asteroid belt]], capturing the fugitive along with alleged accomplice [[Marn Hierogryph]] and two [[Arkanian Offshoot/Legends|Arkanian Offshoots]], [[Jarael]] and [[Gorman Vandrayk|Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk]].\n\nHierogryph negotiated for his and the Offshoots' freedom in exchange for the codes to his Taris storehouses, and Ying brought Carrick alone to Taris to turn him over to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Greeted by a massive throng of onlookers, Ying took Carrick to the five [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] of the Tarisian [[Jedi Tower]], hoping for a substantial reward. It was there that Ying learned, much to his surprise, that Carrick was not the Padawan killer&mdash;the Masters had done the deed and framed Carrick. Although Ying tried to leave, Jedi Master [[Lucien Draay]] decided that the Twi'lek knew too much, and [[Death/Legends|slew]] him with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Cost is nothin' if the goods are quality, milord.

Carrick went on the run with the help of Hierogryph, and a large [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] was placed on their heads. Not normally bounty [[Hunting/Legends|hunters]], Ying and the crew of the ''Oroko'' joined in on the hunt for Carrick and Hierogryph, eventually finding them in the [[Taris asteroid belt]]. The two fugitives were aboard the [[junk hauler]] [[The Last Resort (starship)|''Last Resort'']], which the ''Oroko'' captured with its [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]]. Along with Carrick and Hierogryph, Ying and the ''Oroko'' also brought aboard [[Jarael]] and [[Gorman Vandrayk|Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk]], the [[Arkanian Offshoot/Legends|Arkanian Offshoot]] owners of ''The Last Resort''. Soon afterward, Ying made a deal with Hierogryph&mdash;in exchange for the codes to Hierogryph's Taris storehouses, Ying would tell the authorities that ''The Last Resort'' had been destroyed in the [[asteroid belt]], and that he had found Carrick alone in an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]]. Ying would then allow Hierogryph, Jarael and Camper to go free once they reached Taris.<ref name=\"kotor5\" />\n\n[[File:Lucienmurderbountyhunter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Valius Ying is slain by Lucien Draay.]]\nWhen Ying and the ''Oroko'' returned to Taris with their \"guests\" in tow, Ying took a [[Unidentified shuttle (Oroko)|shuttle]] down to Taris's [[Upper City]] with Carrick, who was restrained in [[Stun cuffs|handcuffs]], intending to bring the runaway Padawan to the five [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] stationed at the local [[Jedi Tower]]. Ying and Carrick were greeted by a massive crowd and heavy press coverage&mdash;reports on the event were broadcast as far away as the planet [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. Ying paraded Carrick through the throng of spectators to the Tower, where he and his [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] were scanned for weapons and recording devices before being allowed to meet with the Masters. Ying told the Masters his false story of having found Carrick in a lifepod, but the [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] Jedi [[Q'Anilia]] immediately saw through the lie. To Ying's surprise, [[Lucien Draay]], Carrick's Master, admitted that Carrick had not actually [[Death/Legends|killed]] his classmates, but that he was what the Masters wanted all the same. Furious, Carrick and Draay argued, revealing intimate and secret details of the fateful night, and Ying learned that the five Masters had actually killed the Padawans and framed Carrick after he narrowly escaped death at their hands. Disturbed by these revelations, Ying attempted to take his leave and return to his [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]]<ref name=\"kotor6\" />&mdash;however, Draay would not allow Ying to leave knowing what he did.<ref name=\"cswe\" /> Draay told Ying that the Jedi would be requiring his shuttle, and when Ying protested, Draay quickly slew the Twi'lek gangster with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. In the end, Carrick was able to escape his predicament with the help of Hierogryph and the two Offshoots, who came back to save him.<ref name=\"kotor6\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I know Valius.

Although not usually a bounty hunter, he joined the hunt for Hierogryph and Zayne Carrick when it became profitable, but was willing to negotiate with his captives once he found them in the Taris [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] belt.<ref name=\"kotor5\" /> Ying was also willing to lie, even to a group of Jedi Masters, to uphold his end of a bargain. As a bounty hunter, Ying did not particularly care whether Carrick had actually committed the crime he was accused of, doing the job for the money. However, he was extremely surprised and disturbed when he learned the truth behind the Padawan Massacre, and sought to extricate himself from the situation as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"kotor6\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|For Valius' design, I suggested to Travel Foreman and Brian Ching that we come up with an alien Tony Soprano &ndash; a gangleader who's somewhat full of himself and only later realizes he's in over his head.
