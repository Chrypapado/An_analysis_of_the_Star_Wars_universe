As of [[40 ABY]], he was an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] in the [[Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet]]. He served as captain of the [[Dodonna (Galactic-class)|''Dodonna'']], as well as commander of the [[Galactic Alliance Second Fleet|Second Fleet]] task force that invaded the [[Corellian system]] and occupied Tralus.\n\n==Biography==\nA native of [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]], Klauskin had an unusual condition, in that he was visited by his dead wife, [[Edela Klauskin|Edela]]. The apparition, maintained by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Lumiya]] from a distant location, influenced him into carrying out actions which were designed to foment conflict between the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] and [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], such as the ill-fated [[Operation Roundabout]], where he [[Battle of Tralus (Second Galactic Civil War)|invaded]] [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]]. His [[Aide/Legends|aide]], [[Fiav Fenn]], found him crying out for his dead wife after the operation concluded. He was replaced by [[Tarla Limpan]], and was committed to a [[Medcenter/Legends|hospital]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].<ref name=\"betrayal\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]''</ref>\n\nKlauskin was to play a further part in events. His [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], Commenor, had voiced support for Corellia under [[Fyor Rodan]]. Lumiya, recognizing a chance to bring Commenor into the conflict, visited him again in the guise of Edela and controlled him as he escaped the hospital and traveled to the Galactic Alliance scout screen around [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]], whose three assault [[Fleet/Legends|fleets]] had been pledged to the Corellian cause. Blustering his way aboard the [[Shamunaar (frigate)|''Shamunaar'']], Klauskin tricked the [[Starship/Legends|ship's]] [[Commander/Legends|commander]], [[Biurk]], into recalling the defense screen, whereupon he [[Death/Legends|killed]] the [[Captain/Legends|captain]] and opened the entire ship to vacuum, killing the crew, while secure in the auxiliary bridge. He then turned the ship over to the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothans]] and [[Tathak K'roylan]], whose fleets attacked the Galactic Alliance's [[Blockade of Corellia]], and broke their hold on the [[Corellian system|system]].<ref name=\"exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing Commenor's similar successful assault on the [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]], Matric Klauskin returned to his homeworld, where he was praised as a hero and retired.<ref name=\"exile\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMatric Klauskin was created as a secondary character for the first book of the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy of the Force]]'' series, ''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'', written by [[Aaron Allston]]. He later appeared in ''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'', the fourth book in the series and the second book of the series written by Allston.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Matric Klauskin\n|pl=Matric Klauskin\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Klauskin, Matric}}\n[[Category:Commenori]]\n[[Category:Confederation personnel]]\n[[Category:Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet admirals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
