In [[3956 BBY]], he failed to repay a debt he owed to [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Davik Kang]]. Kang sent [[Unidentified Human bounty hunter (Upper City)|two]] [[Unidentified Aqualish bounty hunter (Upper City)|bounty hunters]] after him, cornering him in the [[Upper City]]. [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Infantry/Legends|soldiers]] [[Carth Onasi]] and [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] noticed the commotion and stepped in, [[Death/Legends|killing]] both [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]]. In addition, Revan gave the [[Merchant/Legends|merchant]] 100 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], which he thankfully accepted before leaving to pay off Kang.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Davik's going to want to make an example of you! You're coming with us.''\"<br />\"''No&mdash;help! Somebody help!

He took out a loan with local [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Davik Kang]], despite being warned against such actions by his wife.<ref name=\"KotOR\" /> However, when, in [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"CG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> he failed to make a scheduled repayment of 100 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], Kang sent two [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] to collect on his debt.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nThe bounty hunters, [[Unidentified Aqualish bounty hunter (Upper City)|an Aqualish]] and [[Unidentified Human bounty hunter (Upper City)|a Human]], managed to track him down and corner him in the [[Upper City]], where they began terrorizing him. The merchant offered the 50 credits remaining in his possession as a down payment, but the bounty hunters refused, preparing to take him to Kang as an example to others who did not pay their debts. Knowing that he would be [[Death/Legends|killed]], the merchant panicked and yelled for help.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{GameLS|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nFugitive [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Carth Onasi]], on a [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|mission]] to rescue [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Bastila Shan]], had been silently watching the exchange from a distance, and upon hearing the yell decided to act. Despite their need to maintain a low profile, Revan opted to intervene, approaching the bounty hunters. Revan refused to allow the bounty hunters to harm the merchant, leading to a scuffle that resulted in the death of both of the hunters.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nThe merchant thanked Revan and Onasi for saving his life, but knew that it was a temporary solution at best, as Kang would continue to send bounty hunters until he was dead or his debt was paid. Realizing that the merchant was unlikely to survive, Revan offered him the 100 credits he needed. The merchant was extremely thankful and hurried off to repay Kang.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You're giving me 100 credits? Just like that?

Thank you!|The merchant upon receiving 100 credits|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:LetsShootTheOldGuyAndTakeHisMoney.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The bounty hunters confront the merchant]]\nThis merchant ignored his wife's warnings and borrowed from Kang a debt he could not repay, becoming edgy and fearful when he was caught by the bounty hunters. When Revan offered to pay his debt, the merchant was overcome with both appreciation and disbelief, amazed by the generosity of the strangers.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Hand over all your credits if you want to live!|A dark side dialogue option available to the player|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nThis merchant's first appearance in [[canon]] was as a non-player character labeled \"bullied merchant\" in the ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' [[video game]], where the player, Revan, can interact with him. The player has two opportunities to earn [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] points during the confrontation; once when he chooses to save the merchant and again when he gives the merchant 100 credits. These credits can be re-obtained afterward by searching the bodies of the dead bounty hunters, who carry 50 credits apiece. However, if Revan saves the merchant while wearing [[Sith trooper armor/Legends|Sith trooper armor]], the man will be frightened and will quickly retreat from the scene without conversing with Revan.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nThere are also several non-canon dialogue options open to the player. When the player first approaches the bounty hunters, he or she may instead choose to attack them out of spite, or simply back off, in which case the hunters depart with the merchant. In addition, the player may choose to leave without giving the merchant any credits, or demand 50 credits from him&mdash;the latter of which will give the player [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points. If Carth Onasi is in the party, he will protest against such an action and will let the merchant go without taking his credits. However, if Revan is acting alone or is accompanied by any other available party member, the merchant will give him 50 credits and will then run away in fear.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446\n}}\n\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
