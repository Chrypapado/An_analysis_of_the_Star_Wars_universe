Shen lived in the [[Farm/Legends|farming]] village of [[Onacra]] with his daughter [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri]] and her grandfather, a local mystic known as the [[Old One]]. By [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Shen's village came under attack by a criminal gang known as the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud Riders]]. When Onacra enlisted the aid of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] hero [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] to defend itself against the Cloud-Riders, Shen served as the village's spokesman when Solo and his [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3|Star-Hoppers]] visited Onacra.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Please ignore the Old One, Han Solo! He fancies himself as a mystic... a shaman... capable of summoning some legendary monster to save our village!|Oncho Shen, to Han Solo|Star Wars (1977) 9}}\nA native of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]], Oncho Shen lived in the small [[Farm/Legends|farming]] community of [[Onacra]] during the era of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. For most of his life, Shen lived a simple existence growing [[maze-stalk]] while raising his daughter [[Merri Shen Doshun|Merri]]. Also present was Merri's grandfather, a mystic known as the [[Old One]]&mdash;Shen had some disdain for the elderly man, scorning his belief in [[Shaman/Legends|shamanistic]] power. By [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], his village had become a target of the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]], a vicious gang<ref name=\"marvel9\" /> led by former pro [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] [[Swoop racing/Legends|racer]]<ref name=\"gamer4\">{{GamerCite|4|The Starhoppers of Aduba-3}}</ref> [[Serji-X Arrogantus]].<ref name=\"marvel9\" />\n\nDesperate to be rid of the Cloud-Riders, the people of Onacra enlisted the aid of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] hero [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who put together the makeshift militia known as the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]] to defend the village. Solo and his gunslingers made the journey to Onacra from the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] of [[Tun Aduban]], along the way saving Shen's daughter Merri from a [[high-hound]] attack. Shen, who had been chosen by his fellow villagers as their spokesman, greeted the Star-Hoppers upon their arrival in Onacra, expressing his undying gratitude for his daughter's rescue. As the Star-Hoppers prepared for the Cloud-Riders to descend upon the village, Solo was approached by the Old One, who offered to aid their defense of Onacra by summoning a great legendary beast. Disbelieving of the old man's ramblings, Shen stepped in and quickly urged Solo to ignore his entreaties. However, Shen's skepticism was proven wrong in the coming [[Battle of Aduba-3|battle]], when the Old One succeeded in calling forth the massive [[Behemoth from the World Below]] from its slumber beneath the village.<ref name=\"marvel9\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA family man who lived a simple life in a small farming community, Oncho Shen cared deeply for his daughter Merri and was extremely grateful for her rescue by Han Solo and his Star-Hoppers. However, his familial affection didn't fully extend to her grandfather, the Old One, holding a disdainful attitude towards the elderly man's fixation on mysticism.<ref name=\"marvel9\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOncho Shen made his first and only appearance in the ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity in [[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]], written by [[Roy Thomas]] and released in [[1977]].
