While there, he became involved in a number of drinking contests.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nTikko was gruff and spoke [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] poorly. For drinking contests, Tikko preferred to pick opponents, rather than be challenged himself, and normally chose people who were bigger than him. He never challenged anyone who he believed could use [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], as he thought that they were untrustworthy.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Shadows in Green]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ugnaughts]]"}}}]}}}}
