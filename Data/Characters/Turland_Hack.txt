I wish I could be with you&hellip;|Turland Hack to Rookie One|audio=Hack1-RA.ogg|Star Wars: Rebel Assault}}\n'''Turland Hack''', known as \"Hack,\" was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] early in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. After he failed to become a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], Hack took a role in communications and tactical assistance at the Alliance's [[Anchorhead Base]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. There, he helped to train other Rebel pilots, including [[Rookie One]]. Shortly after the [[Battle of Toprawa]], [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] traveled to Tatooine in search of the [[Death Star plans/Legends|stolen plans]] to their [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[battlestation]]. Hack was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during a subsequent attack on Anchorhead Base, when Imperial [[TIE/LN starfighter]]s destroyed the command center in which he was working.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|This is Anchorhead Base&hellip; Mayday, we are under attack!''\"<br />\"''Hold on, Hack!

When he proved unable to qualify for flight school, Hack chose to serve the Alliance in communications and tactical assistance.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|5|Hack, Turland}}</ref> He was assigned to a communications post at [[Anchorhead Base]],<ref name=\"RA manual\">''[[Star Wars: Rebel Assault]]'' manual</ref> a training facility near [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]],<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> and held the rank of [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]]<ref name=\"RA manual\" /> by [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]].<ref name=\"0BBY\" /> Among those who met him, he was simply known as \"Hack.\"<ref name=\"RA manual\" />\n\nWhile training in Mos Eisley, he met [[Rookie One]], a farmboy from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] who had become a daring civilian pilot. Hack was impressed by the young pilot's skill and enthusiasm for the Rebellion<ref name=\"RA manual\" /> and encouraged him to continue his pilot training with the Alliance. Hack helped tutor Rookie One during his early flights,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> and served as both a friend and mentor to the young pilot.<ref name=\"RA manual\" />\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Toprawa]], Hack was working in [[Tac-Comm control]] on the morning when Rookie One took his trials through the nearby [[Beggar's Canyon/Legends|Beggar's Canyon]], the culmination of his training on Tatooine. After granting Rookie One's [[T-16 skyhopper/Legends|T-16 skyhopper]] clearance to depart, Hack wished his friend luck, assuring him that Beggar's Canyon was not as difficult as the runs he used to do. Rookie One succeeded in navigating the canyon in close formation with two members of [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Green Squadron]] and engaging target drones, seeing him proceed to [[R-22 Spearhead starfighter|R-22 Spearhead]] training under [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Jake Farrell/Legends|Jake Farrell]], leaving Hack behind on Tatooine.<ref name=\"RA\" />\n\n[[File:AnchorheadBaseGoBoom.jpg|thumb|left|Turland Hack is killed in the destruction of Anchorhead Base.]]\nShortly after Rookie One's trials,<ref name=\"RA\" /> the [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] arrived at Tatooine, carrying [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and the [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire's]] new [[battlestation]], the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]]. When [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] arrived to capture it aboard the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']], Organa dispatched the plans to Tatooine in the care of the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]]. When Vader realized the plans were no longer aboard the ''Tantive IV'', he ordered his forces to begin searching Tatooine.<ref name=\"ANH\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> This search eventually led the Imperials to discover Anchorhead Base.<ref name=\"RA\" />\n\nThe Rebels called for help from [[Kolaador]], where Rookie One was training under Commander [[Ru Murleen]]. Murleen responded, leading Rookie One and [[Thurlow Harris]], in a three-ship [[Flight/Legends|flight]] of [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|T-65 X-wing starfighters]], to Tatooine. After fighting their way past Imperial forces in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]], the group proceeded into Tatooine's [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]] and headed for Anchorhead base. Murleen signaled the base for a status report and Hack responded, telling them an Imperial attack was already underway. Hearing his friend's voice, Rookie One promised to get their as soon as possible&mdash;however, it was already too late. While Hack spoke to the approaching Rebels, a group of three [[TIE/LN starfighter]]s entered the canyon and opened fire on Anchorhead Base. Their [[Laser cannon/Legends|laser cannon]] blasts destroyed the hangar and control center in which Hack was working, killing him instantly. Rookie One and the other Rebels [[Battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|eliminated]] the TIEs responsible for destroying the base and engaged other Imperial forces before they were forced to withdraw.<ref name=\"RA\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You shouldn't have any problems; Beggar's Canyon isn't half as tough as the runs we used to do.|Turland Hack|audio=Hack2-RA.ogg|Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)}}\nHack was dedicated to the [[Alliance Starfighter Corps]].
