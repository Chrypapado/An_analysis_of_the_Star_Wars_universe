As a young man Wade was piloting one of his father's transports along the [[Corellian Run/Legends|Corellian Run]] when his home planet was [[Destruction of Alderaan|obliterated]] by the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]]. Distraught over his loss and left with very few options he took up risky [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] jobs and eventually found himself on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] where he quickly fell foul of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] after refusing to pay a protection levy at the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]]. He was subsequently forced to compete in his [[Jabba's demolition games|underground \"demolition\" games]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Demolition\" />\n\nVox would likely have been killed if not for his growing connection to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] especially faced with such competitors as [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], he also learned that the [[X-34 landspeeder/Legends|X-34 landspeeder]] he had customized after purchasing from [[BoShek/Legends|BoShek]]<ref name=\"Star Wars: Demolition\" /> had belonged to none other than [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] who had sold it upon his departure from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Vox looked up to Luke as the last remaining [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], and felt that he too would one day achieve greatness.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Demolition\" />\n\n[[File:Vox_Saber.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wade Vox's Lightsaber]]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the demolition tournament and with his new found freedom Vox followed his ambitions of exploring his connection to the Force at a deeper level when he constructed a crimson [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]],<ref name=\"Lightsaber\">''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exfTYQXPQ_Y]''</ref> This in itself is a remarkable achievement due to his almost complete lack of training, a feat matched a decade or so later by [[Jaden Korr]]. Soon after doing so however, he was discovered by [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] who tried to take him out with a long range [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. Vox deflected the shots with relative ease and evaded the notorious [[Jedi hunter/Legends|Jedi hunter]] almost to her satisfaction.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Bullseye!|Wade Vox|Star Wars: Demolition}}\nVox had a somewhat reckless and rebellious nature that would land him in trouble with such people as [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] and showed cockiness in his victories in the tournament.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Demolition\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:Vox_Start_of_the_Games.jpg|thumb|250px|Vox in his [[X-34 landspeeder/Legends|X-34 landspeeder]]]]\n{{Quote|I've made some special modifications|Wade Vox|Star Wars: Demolition}}\nVox was a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and although had no formal training did show a degree of talent with this limited skill especially in his ability as a pilot much like a young [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]. He was able to generate a powerful Force attack from his speeder to cripple enemies for a short amount of time giving the impression that Vox must have spent some time practicing this or that he was naturally adept at this kind of Force power. Either way his flourishing abilities were worthy enough to gain the attention of [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]]. Along with this is his building of a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] which is near impossible for anyone without notable Force connection; just where and how he acquired the necessary parts for this task are unknown.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Demolition\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWade Vox was featured as a playable character in ''[[Star Wars: Demolition]]'' and was voiced by [[Holt McCallany]]. An alternative ending to Demolition sees Vox thrown to the floor in Jabba's throne room much to the amusement of Jabba's court. Aurra Sing then stands over him and reveals a [[Vibroblade/Legends|Vibroblade]]. The end of this sequence gives the impression that he comes to a sticky end.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Demolition\" />\n\n[[File:Wade_Vox_in_action.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wade Vox fights in Jabba's tournament.]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Demolition]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|50|Gamescape}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[Demolition: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Wade Vox\n|ru=\u0423\u044d\u0439\u0434 \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vox, Wade}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
