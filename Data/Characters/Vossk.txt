He eventually left the [[Bounty Hunters' Guild/Legends|Bounty Hunters' Guild]] and gave up his position as leader of the organization. In [[3951 BBY]], Vossk met [[Meetra Surik]] on Nar Shaddaa and warned her about the other [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunters who were after her bounty on the surface of the moon.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|You are brave to walk here, ex-Jeedai&hellip; in landing on Nar Shaddaa, you have stepped into the krayt dragon's jaws.|Vossk, to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nVossk was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] who lived during the [[Dark Wars|years]] after the [[Jedi Civil War]].

When the Jedi approached Vossk, the Trandoshan warned her about dangers she would encounter on the Smuggler's Moon. He told her about the [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] that had been placed on her head by the [[Exchange]] crime syndicate, and suggested getting rid of the bounty by trying to make members of the Exchange collect it and thus revealing themselves.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\nHe also gave her information on notable bounty hunters operating on Nar Shaddaa, such as the nest of [[Insect/Legends|insective]] [[Gand/Legends|Gands]], the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] bounty hunter group called the [[Zhug brothers]], two [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] female [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] known as the [[Twin Suns (assassins)|Twin Suns]], and a group of [[HK-50 series assassin droid]]s. In addition, he informed Surik of two bounty hunters who were rivals, the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Hanharr]] and [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Mira]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nVossk gave a great value to the rules and honor between the bounty hunters, namely the Bounty Hunters' Creed, and his disgust at others ignoring the creed compelled him to leave the Bounty Hunters' Guild. He was especially respectful toward the bounty hunter Mira, whom he regarded as the best bounty hunter on Nar Shaddaa due to her dedication to the hunt, rather than the slaughter that many other bounty hunters had taken up.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVossk was first introduced in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', a [[video game]] developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] that was first released on the [[Xbox]] platform in [[December]] [[2004]] and for [[Personal computer|PC]] [[February|two months]] [[2005|later]].
