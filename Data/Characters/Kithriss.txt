A devoted follower of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], Kithriss spent several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] on the planet [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] at Palpatine's request at some point during or after [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]. There, Palpatine secretly exposed the Baron to a number of [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] techniques, in an attempt to make Kithriss resistant to the effects of [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]].

During the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] following the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], when Kithriss was in his early twenties, he entered the service of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. At some point, he purchased two [[Theelin/Legends|Theelin]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] from a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Gangster/Legends|gangster]] and appointed the pair as his [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]]. Kithriss became devoted to [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], the leader of the Empire,<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" /> and, at some point following the Empire's [[Declaration of a New Order|formation]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]],<ref name=\"19 BBY\">''[[The Queen of Air and Darkness]]'' indicates that Kithriss traveled to [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] at some point after the [[Declaration of a New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], which, according to ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'', took place in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]].</ref> at Palpatine's request, Kithriss traveled to the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] planet [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] and spent some [[Time/Legends|time]] at Palpatine's [[Emperor's Citadel|newly-constructed retreat]] on the world. There, over a period of several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]], Palpatine covertly exposed Kithriss to various different [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]&ndash;based [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] techniques, in an attempt to make the Baron resistant to the effects of [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]].<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" />\n\nIn about [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">The ''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'' module ''[[Echoes of the Jedi]]'' states that the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vhiin Thorla]] traveled to the [[Almas Academy]] two years after the declaration of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], which is dated to 19 BBY by ''The New Essential Chronology''. This thus indicates that ''Dawn of Defiance'' is set in about 17 BBY.</ref> the Empire secretly made a deal with the Hutt [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Darga Jiramma Mionne]], whereby Darga would supply the Empire with [[Tibanna/Legends|Tibanna]] gas for use on a [[Sarlacc Project|clandestine Imperial project]] to construct a [[Super Star Destroyer prototype|prototype]] [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]]. As part of the arrangement, the Empire agreed to pay Darga a large sum of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], which were to be surreptitiously handed over to Darga's [[Agent/Legends|agent]] [[Mirana Fioro]] during the [[Cloud City Sabacc Tournament]], which was being held in [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] of the planet [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. To ensure that Fioro did not do anything to expose the secrecy of the transaction, the Empire planned to have Kithriss oversee the exchange, and a message was sent to the Baron's [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] that ordered him to travel to the [[Yarith Bespin/Legends|Yarith Bespin]] [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]] in Cloud [[City/Legends|City]]. The purpose of his assignment was not divulged to him, and he was told that he would receive further instructions via the hotel's [[Computer/Legends|computer]] system, and that during the assignment, he was to maintain communications silence and not tell anyone that he was an Imperial agent. Kithriss also received instructions to meet up with four [[clone stormtrooper]]s prior to embarking for Bespin who had been assigned to guard him during the mission. Unknown to Kithriss, the [[Cloning/Legends|clones]] were under orders to observe him and see if he demonstrated any signs of instability as a result of his exposure to Palpatine's techniques, and if so, to quietly [[Death/Legends|kill]] him.<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" />\n\nAccompanied by his two Theelin bodyguards and the four [[Stormtrooper/Legends|troopers]], Kithriss traveled to the Yarith Bespin and checked in to one of the hotel's luxury suites. However, he was unsatisfied with the standard of his accommodation, so he went to the hotel's lobby and loudly berated one of the hotel employees, demanding that the hotel manager allocate him a better room. Everyone in the lobby turned to watch Kithriss' tirade, and the commotion attracted the attention of a group of undercover [[Alderaanian Resistance]] operatives, who were investigating Darga's dealings with the Empire. Due to the presence of Kithriss' clone [[Trooper/Legends|trooper]] guards and the style of the Baron's garb, the operatives recognized that he was an Imperial agent and deduced that he might possess information relating to the Empire's deal with Darga. Once Kithriss had finished his outburst, the hotel staff rushed off to attend to his requests, and the Baron headed out onto the streets of Cloud City with the Theelin and the four clone troopers. The [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] agents followed the party and subsequently engaged Kithriss and his entourage in combat on a Cloud City walkway. The operatives eventually defeated Kithriss and stole his datapad.<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" />\n\nA short time afterward, the Baron's superiors on the planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]&mdash;who were unaware of the Alderaanians' attack on him&mdash;sent a set of instruction to the Kithriss' datapad, which directed him to oversee the transaction in the [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] tournament. The message also stated that he was not to interfere with the exchange and that once it had taken place, he was to transmit a confirmation message to Coruscant and then return to Chandrila. The agents then infiltrated the sabacc tournament, in an attempt to discover the nature of the transfer of funds to Darga.<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKithriss was arrogant, and, despite his young age, he carried himself with an air of superiority that befitted a veteran member of the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]],<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" /> the Empire's governing body.<ref name=\"TFUCG\">''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''</ref> He was an ardent supporter of Palaptine and was one of the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor's]] greatest sycophants, and his conditioning on Byss resulted in him becoming even more fiercely loyal to Palpatine. Kithriss also gained a limited resistance to [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-based attacks as a result of his exposure to Palpatine's techniques, but the Baron was unaware of the ability and the effect was due to wear off after a few [[Standard month/Legends|months]]. Kithriss spoke in a precise tone and had a [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] accent, and, in addition to [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], he was able to speak the [[Language/Legends|languages]] [[Bocce/Legends|Bocce]], [[High Galactic/Legends|High Galactic]], [[Twi'leki/Legends|Twi'leki]], and [[Kel Dor (language)/Legends|Kel Dor]]. He had dark [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], which was cut in a style that was popular with agents of the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order/Legends|Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]]. He wore clothing of a style that was considered the latest fashion among the [[Chandrilan/Legends|Chandrilan]] [[Noble/Legends|nobility]], and he was equipped with a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]], a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], a datapad, and a sabacc deck.<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBaron Kithriss was created by [[Rodney Thompson]], and he appeared in ''[[The Queen of Air and Darkness]]'', a [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] adventure that was released on [[Wizards.com]] in [[2008]], as part of the ''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'' campaign. During the adventure, the players [[Roleplaying game|roleplay]] as the team of Alderaanian Resistance operatives. The player-characters' fight with Kithriss can begin in a number of ways, with Kithriss initiating the bout if he suspects that the Alderaanian agents are following him, or if the player-characters ask him questions about Darga and the Empire. During the altercation, the two Theelin bodyguards remain near to Kithriss, and the Baron tries to allow the Theelin and the clone troopers to defend him. If he gets close to the player-characters, he attacks them with his vibroblade. The manner of the defeat of Kithriss and his party is dependent on the actions of the players, and it is possible for the player characters to kill him.<ref name=\"TQOAAD\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=The Queen of Air and Darkness|int=The Queen of Air and Darkness|archivedate=20100118064618}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperials]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
