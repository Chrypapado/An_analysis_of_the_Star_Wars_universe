Balding, black-bearded ke Harran toured the two young [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] around the [[Dammant Killers]] [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missile]] factory, covering up whole assembly lines of missiles.\n\nYoung Skywalker told ke Harran his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] was a practice weapon. When Skywalker later used it to cut a hole in a wall panel, Solo explained to ke Harran that Skywalker had been telling the truth, from a certain point of view: Skywalker ''did'' practice with the lightsaber. The two Jedi then were forced into a confrontation with tens of Adumari guards - but ke Harran's attempt to hide the secret assembly line was a failure, as Skywalker was able to send a [[Hologram/Legends|holo]] recording of the assembly line back to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Testan ke Harran\n|pl=Testan ke Harran\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ke Harran, Testan}}\n[[Category:Adumari]]\n[[Category:Corellian nationals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
