The criminal [[Broken Horn Syndicate]] attempted to extort the [[Bartender|barkeeper]] for protection [[Currency|money]], sending a [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid]] to collect it.\n\nOn the fifteenth [[Empire Day]], a trio of Imperial [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]] entered Jho's cantina and forced him to play the Imperial broadcast, which was hijacked by the [[senator]]-in-exile [[Gall Trayvis]] in order to declare a boycott of Imperial rule. Jho opposed Imperial rule and occasionally provided the [[Spectres|rebel crew]] of the [[starship]] ''[[Ghost]]'' with information. He also helped the rebel sympathizer [[Merei Spanjaf]], [[Spanjaf family|her family]], and the [[Leonis family|Leonis parents]] to escape offworld. In [[1 BBY]], Old Jho was executed for helping suspected rebels [[Raid on a suspected rebel cell|escape]] and his bar was taken over by [[Flight baron|Baron]] [[Valen Rudor]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins===\n{{Quote|Imperials have locked down the ports and put Destroyers in orbit. It's a full planetary blockade.|Jho informs the rebels of Imperial activity on Lothal|Empire Day (episode)}}\nThe [[Ithorian]] [[Gender|male]] known as \"Old\" Jho was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Ithor]], but left his [[homeworld]] and settled on the planet [[Lothal]] at a [[time]] when the planet's [[Capital City]] was just a sleepy trading post. He remained on Lothal for many [[Standard year|years]], during which he witnessed [[Capital]] [[City]] transform into a busy center of administration for the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"HtH\" /> On Lothal, Jho owned and operated a popular [[cantina]] known as [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]]<ref name=\"DB\">{{Databank|old-jho|Old Jho|archivedate=20200319202644}}</ref> and a [[Hangar|docking bay]],<ref name=\"HtH\" /> both located in a small, remote outpost/village which was known as [[Jhothal]], which was named after him.<ref>''[[Star Wars Rebels: Visual Guide: Epic Battles]]''</ref> The cantina was decorated with parts from a [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry]] dating from the [[Clone Wars]] between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], which Jho claimed was the authentic remains of the vessel known as the ''[[Crumb Bomber]]''.<ref name=\"Trivia\">{{SW|url=series/star-wars-rebels/empire-day-trivia-gallery|text=Empire Day Trivia Gallery}}</ref>\n\n===Aiding rebels===\n[[File:Empire-day-trivia-gallery.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jho playing the Imperial broadcast on Empire Day.]]\nOn one occasion, an [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid]] working for the criminal [[Broken Horn Syndicate]] entered the Pit Stop and demanded protection [[Currency|money]] from Jho; however, the Ithorian claimed that [[Cikatro Vizago]], the [[Unidentified IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|droid's]] employer, owed him money, after which the [[droid]] slammed its arm down onto the bar.<ref name=\"HtH\" /> On [[Empire Day]], in [[4 BBY]], the Pit Stop was visited by a trio of [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]] who were searching for the [[Rodian]] [[Tseebo]]. The Imperials did not find their target amongst Jho's customers, which included a group of [[Spectres|rebels]] who they did not recognize. The [[pilot]]s then demanded that Jho turn on the Imperial broadcast, which was required to be displayed by Imperial law, and the Ithorian complied; however, the broadcast was almost immediately hijacked by the [[senator]]-in-exile [[Gall Trayvis]], who asked the citizens of Lothal to boycott Imperial rule and Empire Day celebrations. The Imperials demanded that the broadcast be switched off, but Jho refused, after which the pilots left. Jho then spoke with the rebels, explaining that there was a full Imperial [[blockade]] of Lothal.<ref name=\"ED\">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}}</ref>\n\nAt a later date, the rebels returned to Jho's, and [[Garazeb Orrelios]], a [[Lasat]] member of the group, played a game of [[sabacc]] with two other clients, the \"[[The galaxy|galactic]] entrepreneur\" [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] and the Rodian [[Tsoklo]]. While the three were playing, another member of the rebel group, [[Kanan Jarrus]], asked Jho if he had any paying jobs, as the rebels desperately needed [[credit]]s. Unfortunately there was nothing the Ithorian could give them, but he told them Calrissian had been looking for a crew. Jarrus then joined Orellios at the table and Jho witnessed him betting the [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] and then losing it to Calrissian. The rebels then left the canteen with the entrepreneur.<ref name=\"IA\">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>\n\nJho met [[Merei Spanjaf]], the girlfriend of [[Zare Leonis]], when she was working for the [[Gray Syndicate]]. He enjoyed watching [[pirate]]d [[grav-ball]] [[Hologram|holos]] and Spanjaf would deliver as part of her courier duties.<ref name=\"justice\">''[[Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice]]''</ref> Spanjaf later recalled Jho when she needed to get an elderly [[poet]] named [[Holshef]] who was in hiding from the Galactic Empire off the planet. Jho was at first reluctant to help, wondering why Spanjaf would want more trouble after she was finally free from the Gray Syndicate's influence following the [[death]] of its leader, [[Yahenna Laxo]], in an [[Assault on the Gray Syndicate|Imperial assault]]. After reading some of Holshef's poetry, he understood why she would want to save him and agreed to lend the use of his [[Jho's freight hauler|freight hauler]] to get him off the planet. When the Empire began closing in on both [[Spanjaf family|Spanjaf's family]] and the [[Leonis family|Leonises]], the entire group was forced to flee off-planet to [[Garel]]. Jho [[transport]]ed the Spanjafs and Leonises to the edge of the [[Garel system]] where they were picked up by several crew members of the ''[[Ghost]]'' including Orellios.<ref name=\"secret\">''[[Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy]]''</ref>\n\n===Ryder Azadi's cell===\n[[File:Lothal_resistance_meets_Ezra.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jho and the Lothal resistance meet with Ezra Bridger]]\nBy [[2 BBY]], Jho had joined a [[Lothal resistance group|rebel cell]] led by the former Lothal [[Governor]] [[Ryder Azadi]]. Other cell members included [[Morad Sumar]] and his [[Marriage|wife]] [[Marida Sumar|Marida]], who had lost [[Morad Sumar's farm|their farm]] to the Empire. Jho was spotted at [[Ryder's camp|Azadia's rebel encampment]] when [[Ezra Bridger]], Jarrus, and Chopper arrived to discuss a [[Infiltration of the Imperial Armory Complex|mission]] to infiltrate Capital City's [[Imperial Armory Complex]] in order to steal top secret Imperial plans for a [[TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter|prototype]] [[starfighter]]. When Jarrus, Bridger and Chopper were escaping from the [[factory]], Jho along with Marida and Azadi helped the trio escape in [[landspeeder]]s.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" /> Later, Jho along with other patrons including Azadi and Marida witnessed a live hologram broadcast by the former Imperial Senator [[Mon Mothma]] at his bar urging the [[galaxy]] to rise up against the Empire.<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\" />\n\nHowever, in [[1 BBY]],{{Fact}} Jho was caught by the Imperials when he was caught helping suspected rebels escape a [[Raid on a suspected rebel cell|raid]] carried out by the [[Imperial Security Bureau]]. For assisting the suspected rebels, he was executed. His bar was seized and given to the TIE pilot [[Flight baron|Baron]] [[Valen Rudor]], who converted it into a place popular with Imperials.<ref name=\"The Occupation\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Shut this off!''\"<br />\"''Can't. It's the law.|Jho refuses a TIE pilot's order to shut off the hijacked Imperial broadcast|Empire Day (episode)}}\nJho was an intelligent individual with [[Color|brown]] skin, yellow [[eye]]s and no [[hair]]. By the time of his encounter with the IG-RM thug droid, the Ithorian's age had taken a toll on his reflexes and strength which meant, despite his courage and willingness to fight, that Jho would have been unable to defeat the droid. During the encounter the bartender stood 1.99 [[meter]]s tall and weighed 90 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name=\"HtH\" />\n\nJho was opposed to the [[Imperial Era|rule]] of the Galactic Empire and ignored their mandate that the Imperial broadcast be played at all times,<ref name=\"DB2\">{{Databank|old-jhos-pit-stop|Old Jho's Pit Stop|archivedate=20180303023002}}</ref> even arguing with the TIE pilots when they demanded he comply with the law.<ref name=\"ED\" /> The Ithorian kept his [[ear]]s open for information which could be useful to his customers or enemies of the Empire, and sometimes provided information to the rebel crew of the [[starship]] known as the ''Ghost'',<ref name=\"HtH\" /> who he was friendly with and allowed to dock at his cantina.<ref name=\"RVG\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]''</ref> In combat, Jho would prefer to draw his [[blaster]] under the table to attack an opponent.<ref name=\"HtH\" />\n\nJho enjoyed watching pirated holos of grav-ball games. In his youth, he enjoyed visiting [[Pelamir Gorge]] and listening to the sound of the wind whipping through the [[spine tree]]s and sipping [[root tea]], before the Empire razed the [[forest]]s.<ref name=\"secret\" /> His sympathies for the rebellion and opposition to the Empire later led him to join Azadi's rebel cell.<ref name=\"An Inside Man\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nJho used a [[translator collar]] to speak [[Galactic Basic Standard]] instead of [[Ithorese]] so that customers would understand him. He used a [[hunting blaster]] in combat.<ref name=\"HtH\" /> He also owned a [[freighter]] with an \"iffy\" [[hyperdrive motivator]] which was also modified with weaponry capable of blasting Imperial [[speeder bike]]s into wreckage.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJho was created as a character for the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' television series and was mentioned briefly for the first time in ''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]'', a reference book written by [[Adam Bray]] and released in [[2014]] as part of the build up to show's release later that year.<ref name=\"RVG\" /> More details and an image of the character were then provided in ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head]]'', another '' Rebels'' tie-in book written by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] and also released in 2014.<ref name=\"HtH\" />\n\nThe Ithorian then made his first appearance on the actual show in \"[[Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day]],\" the sixth episode of [[Star Wars Rebels Season One|''Star Wars Rebels'' Season One]], in which Jho was voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].<ref name=\"ED\" /> The character also appeared in an early draft of the first season's eighth episode \"[[Path of the Jedi]],\" in which he was involved in [[Jedi]]-in-training Ezra Bridger's search for a [[kyber crystal]]. Ultimately he was cut from the story when the episode was streamlined to focus on the events within the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]].<ref name=\"PotJt\">{{SW|url=series/star-wars-rebels/path-of-the-jedi-trivia-gallery|text=Path of the Jedi Trivia Gallery}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Jho}}\n*[[Star Wars Rebels (webcomic)|''Star Wars Rebels'' webcomic]]\n*{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}} {{1st}}\n*''[[Path of the Jedi: A Star Wars Rebels Cinestory Comic]]''\n*''[[Ezra's Duel with Danger]]''\n*{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}\n*''[[Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: Recon Missions]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|158|Rebel Bluff}}\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*{{Rebels|An Inside Man}}\n*{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}\n*{{Rebels|The Occupation}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head]]''\n*{{SW|url=series/star-wars-rebels-empire-day-episode-guide|text=\"Empire Day\" Episode Guide - ''Star Wars Rebels''}}\n*{{SW|url=series/star-wars-rebels/path-of-the-jedi-episode-guide|text=Path of the Jedi Episode Guide}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: Visual Guide: Epic Battles]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|24|Databank A-Z|The HoloNet&ndash;General Hux}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|27|Databank A-Z|InterGalactic Banking Clan&ndash;Jakku}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|29|Databank A-Z|Jelucan&ndash;Lord Junn}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*{{BuildXWingCite|37|Starfighter Aces|Valen Rudor &ndash; Elite Pilot of the Imperial Navy}}\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|BB-8 and Other Astromech Droids}}\n*{{Databank|old-jho|Old Jho|archivedate=20200319202644}}\n*{{Databank|old-jhos-pit-stop|Old Jho's Pit Stop|archivedate=20180303023002}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jho#kanon\n|es=Jho\n|fr=Jho\n|ja=\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\n|ka=\u10ef\u10dd (\u10d8\u10d7\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8)\n|pl=Jho\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jho}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Ithorians]]\n[[Category:Lothal resistance members]]\n[[Category:Lothalites]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
