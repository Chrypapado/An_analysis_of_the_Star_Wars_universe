She often hung around in the [[Space Monkey Caf\u00e9]] and the club [[Tyger Burning Bright]], becoming acquainted with the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Narask]] and the former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Tyburn Welles]].\n\nWhen [[Percival Vale]] arrived on Cularin, DeWitt began a relationship with him. They went to live in the city [[Gadrin]], where they joined the [[Bark Lovers' Alliance]], a local environmental group, and set up the shop [[Natural]]. However, [[Higgie Sethven]], a [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] who worked in the shop, began developing a powerful drug there and the companies [[Culpharm]] and [[Genasys]] both sent corporate security teams to the shop, to try and obtain the drug. In the resulting shoot-out, DeWitt, Vale and Sethven took cover inside the shop and were eventually rescued by a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] whom DeWitt's father had hired to find her, as she had been out of contact with him.\n\nDeWitt returned to Bayonard and with her father's blessing, and married Vale shortly afterward.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Find the Lady]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:DeWitt, Selima}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
