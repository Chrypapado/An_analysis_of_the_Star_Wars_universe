A native of the [[planet]] [[Eriadu]], he enlisted in an Imperial [[Junior Academy]] against his [[TK-462's father|father's]] wishes following the [[death]] of his younger sister [[Xea]] at the hands of rebels during a botched attempt to steal [[air scrubber]]s from the [[Unidentified air scrubber farm|farm]] his family worked on. After graduating with ease from the Junior Academy, he trained at the [[Imperial Academy of Eriadu]] in [[Eriadu City/Legends|Eriadu City]] where he was relentlessly mistreated by his instructor [[Commander]] [[Lassar]]. The commander had the [[cadet]]'s squadmates regularly beat him and forced him to complete a five [[kilometer]] run with shattered [[glass]] in his [[boot]]s, after which TK-462 had to rest for two [[Standard week|weeks]] and have his feet reconstructed.\n\nDespite this, TK-462 graduated as a [[stormtrooper]], one of the elite shock [[troop]]s of the [[The galaxy|Galactic]] Empire's [[Imperial Army]]. He was initially stationed on Eriadu, catching petty criminals with his [[squad]] within the fashion district of Eriadu [[City]]; however, when the call was given for more [[trooper]]s to be sent to the [[planet]] [[Lothal]] to fight [[Spectres|rebels]] there, TK-462 volunteered himself and left his [[homeworld]] for the first [[time]]. On Lothal, the stormtrooper found his orders becoming more and more morally ambiguous as he was commanded to burn villages in the name of the Empire. After his squad was tasked with capturing a group of [[kyber crystal]] thieves, his [[Unidentified stormtrooper captain (Lothal)|captain]] began executing civilians in a [[Unidentified resettlement village|resettlement village]]&mdash;where the criminals were thought to be hiding&mdash;in the hopes of drawing them out. Fighting broke out after TK-462 shot a man who had emerged from his home with a [[blaster rifle]], and in the chaos the dead man's [[Unidentified human girl|daughter]] took up her father's weapon and shot TK-462, causing a fatal wound.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood tragedy===\nThe [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who would eventually receive the [[Operating number|designation]] of TK-462 in the [[Imperial Army]]'s [[Stormtrooper Corps]]<ref name=\"TK\" /> was born twenty-six [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]],<ref name=\"Birth\" /> and grew up on an [[Unidentified air scrubber farm|air scrubber farm]] on the [[planet]] [[Eriadu]] with his [[parent]]s. When he was four, his [[TK-462's mother|mother]] gave birth to his younger sister [[Xea]] but then passed away by the time her son had turned twelve. TK-462 and Xea would play on the farm while their [[TK-462's father|father]] worked, pretending the fields of [[air scrubber]]s was a forest or army of [[droid]]s depending on what game they were playing.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\nWhen TK-462 was twelve he allowed Xea to sleep in his bed one night when she felt ill. While they slept a group of rebels began raiding the farm and attempted to steal several of the air scrubbers by pulling them away with tow cables on their [[starship]]s. TK-462's father began firing on the vessels with a [[blaster]] in an attempt to stop the theft, and this woke TK-462 who was drawn outside by the noise. As the boy watched, one of the air scrubbers came loose from the ground but was still held by a power conduit, which his father started firing at in an attempt to free the machine and prevent it falling back to earth if something went wrong. His efforts were in vain however, as the rebel's tow cable soon snapped causing the scrubber to plummet back to earth through the roof of TK-462's bedroom, [[Death|fatally]] crushing Xea in bed.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\nLater that year,<ref name=\"TK\" /> former [[governor]] of Eriadu<ref name=\"Trk\">[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']]</ref> [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] became [[Grand Moff]] and introduced far stricter laws to the world. Due to Tarkin's reign, Eriadu became safe enough that TK-462's father allowed him to travel to the nearby [[city]] of [[Phelar]] alone. Sometime after Xea's death, Tarkin visited the family's air scrubber farm. The Imperial spoke to TK-462's father, but the boy was far more interested in the [[stormtrooper]]s that accompanied Tarkin. When TK-462 asked his father to allow him to enlist, his father refused, having already lost two members of his family; however, TK-462 ignored this refusal, and once he was of age, snuck out at night to join the Empire, leaving only a note behind for his father.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\n===Training on Eriadu===\nTK-462 enlisted at the [[Junior Academy]] in Phelar and graduated with his entire class of seven after a year with ease, as the local authority were keen to provide as many local recruits as possible to the Empire. TK-462 was not surprised when his father did not attend the graduation ceremony, but was disappointed when he was also absent at the [[spaceport]] when the trooper's [[transport]] left for the [[Imperial Academy of Eriadu]]. At the [[Imperial Academy|academy]], TK-462 was assigned to [[Commander]] [[Lassar]], a retired [[clone trooper]] instructor who immediately took a disliking to the boy due to his short height. From the [[cadet]]'s first [[Standard day|day]] at the academy, Lassar had all of TK-462's squadmates beat him in bed every morning until he stopped moving. After about a [[Standard week|week]] of the daily beatings, his squadmates began pulling their punches and TK-462 began feigning some of the pain Lassar expected to see. When new recruits arrived at the end of the first year, Lassar failed to find anyone he hated more than TK-462 amongst them, and so continued the beatings into the next year.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\nA couple of weeks before TK-462's graduation, Lassar gave a toast to all his students just before they were scheduled to run five [[kilometer]]s in full gear. At the end of the toast he alone drank a glass of emerald-[[color]]ed [[wine]] and then smashed the glass with his foot. He then picked up the shards and ordered TK-462 to remove his boots, placing the shattered glass inside and then having the trooper put them back on. TK-462 then managed to complete the run despite the shards, but blacked out after crossing the finishing line. He awoke in the academy's infirmary after having his feet reconstructed, and was informed that he was to rest for two weeks but had successfully made the rank of stormtrooper.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\n===Serving the Empire===\nAfter graduating, TK-462 was assigned to the patrol district five of Eriadu's [[capital]] [[Eriadu City]], which was considered the fashion district. There he and his squadmates spent their time arresting shoplifters and other petty criminals; however, when word got around that the Empire needed more troops to combat [[Spectres|rebels]] on the planet [[Lothal]], TK-462 requested a transfer in order to finally avenge his sister. He was again disappointed not to see his father as he boarded the transport off world, and vomited as soon as his ship left Eriadu's atmosphere as he had never traveled in [[Realspace|space]] before.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\nOn Lothal, TK-462 was assigned to a [[Unidentified stormtrooper commander (Lothal)|stormtrooper captain]] who had grown up as a [[nerf herder]] and frequently used comparisons to [[nerf]] herding in order to explain tactics to his troops. The trooper's assignments on Lothal included burning at least one small village<ref name=\"TK\" /> and, four years before the Battle of [[Yavin 4|Yavin]],<ref name=\"FB\" /> his squad was sent to recover a shipment of stolen [[kyber crystal]]s. The stormtroopers managed to find it before lunch, as it had been dumped near a [[Unidentified resettlement village|resettlement village]] after the thieves panicked at encountering checkpoints on every road in the area.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\n[[File:TK146275_death.png|thumb|left|200px|TK-462 was killed on Lothal.]]\nAfter eating, TK-462 and his squadmates traveled into the village to find the culprits, and upon arriving the [[captain]] pulled a [[Rodian]] [[Unidentified Rodian shopkeeper (Lothal)|shopkeeper]] out into the village center and threatened to kill him on the count of three unless the thieves gave themselves up. After no one came forward, the captain killed the Rodian and then grabbed a [[Unidentified human woman (Lothal)|human woman]], beginning his count again. As he counted, a [[Unidentified human male (Lothal)|human male]] ran out of a nearby building with a blaster, prompting TK-462 to shoot him. After the man fell, his young [[Unidentified human child (Lothal)|daughter]] exited the building that he had come from and tried to shake his corpse awake, laying down beside her father when she could not raise him.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\nChaos then broke out as others in the village attacked, and TK-462 turned to locate a squadmate who had called for aid. In the moment that he turned however, the young girl brought up her father's rifle and shot the stormtrooper. Knowing that the wound was fatal, TK-462 collapsed to his knees and [[blood]] began filling his [[armor]]. He removed his helmet and stared up at the girl who had killed him, and recognized the same hatred in her face that he felt the day his sister had died. Knowing that one day the girl would grow up to kill Imperials for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] as revenge for her father, he felt a strange pride overcome him, and in his final moments grinned at the girl before succumbing to his wound.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAs a child, TK-462 and his sister were not bothered by the ugliness of the farm they grew up on, treating it as a playground and spending all of their time together while their father worked. While she was still alive, his mother taught him the importance of understanding the world around him, and as such he had a relatively proficient understanding of physics by the time he was twelve. When Xea died, a deep hatred for rebels was born within TK-462, and he became determined to enlist with the Galactic Empire in order to kill them. During his training he was driven enough by his determination to serve the Empire and kill rebels that he managed to graduate despite all of Lassar's bullying. During the run that the instructor made him complete with glass shards in his boots, spite for the commander got him through the first five hundred [[meter]]s, with focus and determination getting him through another three steps. After that he felt as if the pain overwhelmed his [[brain]] and he completed the rest on autopilot, not even remembering crossing the finishing line when he later recovered.<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\nWhile capturing petty criminals on Eriadu was not what TK-462 had signed up with the Empire for, he was still satisfied with serving the Empire and preventing crime, especially enjoying it when shoplifters tried to flee. The trooper was troubled by not seeing his father again before he left Eriadu, feeling that there were many things he had never said to the man, and regretting that goodbye was one of them. He enjoyed being deployed on Lothal, feeling that the hardships that the planet's people had suffered made them more genuine, and considering his squadmates there good people. He began to become slightly disillusioned with his work however, having expected morality to be more black and white but finding it increasingly grey as he was ordered to burn villages for the greater good of the Empire. Despite these doubts he always followed orders and took no issue with his captain executing civilians in order to draw out the kyber crystal thieves. Instead of despair he felt pride when he was fatally wounded on Lothal, knowing that he had started the girl who killed him on the same path in life that he had taken, only on the opposite side of the [[Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nAs a member of the Stormtrooper Corps, TK-462 wore standard [[stormtrooper armor]] and carried an [[E-11 blaster rifle]].<ref name=\"TK\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|If I had the choice of all the characters in the ''Star Wars'' universe, I would probably still pick my TK.|Sylvain Neuvel|Bucket List}}\nTK-462 appeared as the titular character of the short story \"[[TK-462 (short story)|TK-462]]\", which was published in ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' [[Star Wars Insider 166|166]] in [[2016]] with illustrations by [[Drew Baker]]. The stories author [[Sylvain Neuvel]] was also [[Bucket List|interviewed]] by [[James Andrew Rosen]] for the issue of ''Insider'' and stated in the interview that he wished he could have fleshed out TK-462's life and character more but did not have space, lamenting that the stormtrooper never even got a girlfriend.\n\nThe dates for both Xea and TK-462's deaths were provided by Neuvel on [[Wikipedia:Twitter|Twitter]]; however, since Xea's death occurs in the same year as Wilhuff Tarkin's promotion to Grand Moff, Neuvel's approximate date of eleven years before the Battle of Yavin contradicts the novel [[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] which states that the promotion occurs fourteen years before the Battle of Yavin. This article assumes that the novel instead of the tweet is correct, but still uses the date provided by tweet for TK-462's death.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|166|TK-462 (short story)|TK-462}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lothal Imperial Garrison members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
