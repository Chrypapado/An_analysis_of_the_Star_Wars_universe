Always has.|[[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] describes Bey|Star Wars (1977) 100: First Strike}}\n'''Bey''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]]/[[Nagai]] [[Hybrid/Legends|hybrid]] from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. He was a friend of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo's]] and, growing up, he acted as a big brother to Solo, defending him from bullies and teaching him to fight. As a man, Bey took to a role as a rambling guardian, exploring [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and helping those in need. During this time, Bey crash-landed on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Nagi]], where he met his long-lost mother, [[Krai H'voc]], and his half-brother, [[Ozrei N'takkilomandrife]]. The Nagai were preparing for an [[Nagai\u2013Tof War|attack]] on the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] and, wanting to aid his newfound family, Bey decided to help. Bey returned to Alliance [[Realspace/Legends|space]] to act as a double agent for the Nagai.\n\nJoining [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore]] [[Fenn Shysa]] on his [[Mandalore/Legends|homeworld]], Bey aided the Mandalorians in forming a resistance group to counterattack the advancing Nagai, earning their trust. Bey accompanied Shysa to the Rebels' [[Alliance High Command/Legends|headquarters]] on the [[Endor/Legends|forest moon of Endor]], using the position to figure out the Alliance's plan of attack against the Nagai. Bey was eventually found out during the [[Second Battle of Endor]] and fled from the Rebel base after a fight with Solo. After the Nagai joined forces with the Alliance following the [[Battle of Zeltros]], Bey rejoined his former comrades under [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]], working as an undercover agent to infiltrate the [[Tof]]. Following the end of the conflict, Bey began working for the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|We practically grew up together&hellip;my whole life, wherever I went, it seemed like Bey was around, at least part of the time, coming and going&hellip;|Han Solo|Star Wars (1977) 100: First Strike}}\nBey was born in [[36 BBY/Legends|36 BBY]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. His mother was [[Krai H'voc]], a [[Nagai]] advance [[Scout/Legends|scout]] that had entered [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Realspace/Legends|space]] to judge whether [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] was ripe for invasion. H'voc settled on Corellia during this time, but she inadvertently became romantically entangled with a [[Human/Legends|Human]] while there. H'voc eventually married the man and gave birth to Bey, but she couldn't stay on the world. When her Nagai superiors learned of the marriage, they ordered her to a different location and forced her to end the relationship.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> She returned to her people to report on the status of the galaxy, which was currently engaged in [[Clone Wars/Legends|civil war]], abandoning her son and his [[Bey's father|father]] in the process.<ref name=\"Tof\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" /> Bey's father resented H'voc for abandoning him, and he took out his rage out on his own son. As a [[near-Human]] hybrid, many people treated Bey as though he was less than a person&mdash;a brainless monster.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\n[[File:YoungBey.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bey talks with Han Solo after winning the Corellian Bloodstripe.]]\nHowever, even as a young man, Bey was much larger than his contemporaries, and he used his size to his advantage.<ref name=\"First Strike\" /> By age seventeen, Bey had grown to his full height.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> Roughly the size of a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]], Bey was an imposing figure, and he was perfectly capable of holding his own against others that might think of turning their prejudices into physical violence. After learning firsthand the cruelties that others could inflict upon one another, Bey often kept a lookout for those that were ganged up on. It was in this role that Bey first became acquainted with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] during the events of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. While walking the streets of Corellia, Bey witnessed a nine-year-old<ref name=\"Tof\" /> Solo being bullied by several other boys his age. Although Solo tried to fight off the group all by himself, he was easily overwhelmed and soon fell victim to their vicious assault. Bey intervened in the fight, scaring off the gang and helping Solo up.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nFrom that point on, Solo became Bey's \"little buddy,\" and Bey began teaching Solo how to excel in hand-to-hand combat. Bey showed Solo how to fight with his head and not with his rage, explaining how his anger could easily be turned against him. As the two began to grow, Bey became an idol to Solo, someone whom the young man looked to for guidance. Around this time, Bey's father passed away, and Bey decided to join the [[Corellian Security Force]].<ref name=\"Tof\" /> While working for CorSec, Bey won the [[Corellian Bloodstripe]] for his heroics, something that Solo was incredibly impressed by, and he vowed to emulate his friend.<ref name=\"First Strike\" /> However, Bey's heroism was not just noticed by admirers. The newly formed [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] was attempting to arrest greater control over planetary police forces. Bey, as a half-alien hero of CorSec, did not fit with the Imperial's [[Humanocentrism|humanocentric]] views, and they planned for Bey's downfall. In what would prove to be Bey's final mission, the CorSec agent was involved in the evacuation of a passenger liner. A local terrorist group had rigged the transport with explosives, and Bey's efforts saved the lives of many. However, before Bey could escape the passenger liner, the bomb detonated.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> Bey was badly hurt, including losing his eyesight.<ref name=\"First Strike\" /> When he awoke in the [[Coronet Hospital|hospital]], he was met by Solo, who informed him that he had permanently lost his left eye, but that his other eye could be fixed with a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] implant.<ref name=\"Eyes\">In [[Star Wars (1977) 100|''Star Wars'' (1977) 100]], when Solo meets Bey in the hospital, he tells Bey that \"Only one of your eyes is gone&hellip;they'll make you an electronic replacement for the other&hellip;and a patch.\" Due to the wording, it's unclear if both eyes were lost and only one was able to be given a replacement, or if the one eye was given both a replacement and a patch for it. For the purposes of this article, it is assumed that the first explanation is correct as a patch for his cybernetic eye would likely be unnecessary.</ref> After weeks in recovery and extensive surgery, he was restored to health.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> After the procedures, Bey took to wearing an electronic red eye patch for his inoperable left eye, giving him a defining look for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"First Strike\" /> However, the loss of his left eye was used as evidence that Bey was unfit for duty. Although other CorSec officers were allowed to remain in the force despite much worse injuries, bigoted Imperial officials made sure that the half-human hybrid would no longer have a career in the police force.<ref name=\"Tof\" />\n\n===Living legend===\n{{Quote|Even when I was a kid on Tatooine, we'd hear stories about Bey, the way he traveled around, the great things he did for people. It got so I didn't believe he was even a real person.|Luke Skywalker|Star Wars (1977) 100: First Strike}}\nFollowing this incident, Bey began to explore the galaxy, moving from place to place, learning what he could and making friends where he could. Bey's travels were an excuse to search for his mother, hoping to find the truth behind her sudden abandonment of her family.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> Bey continued to assist those in need during his travels, giving him quite a reputation. As he roamed from planet to planet, Bey never asked for a reward for his feats, and eventually many parts of the galaxy treated him as some kind of mythic hero.<ref name=\"First Strike\" /><ref name=\"Far, Far Away\">[[Star Wars (1977) 101|''Star Wars'' (1977) 101]]</ref> However, during these exploits, Bey never felt truly at home. The people he came to help initially hesitated to accept him, judging whether or not he'd be able to perform some heroics for them, before they treated him with kindness.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nHowever, after years of searching, Bey would eventually find his home. Using clues that had been left by his deceased father, Bey began searching near the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Based on stories from other [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], he learned of several mysterious spacecraft that would group together in a lifeless sector of space. Bey spotted one of these ships and followed it, eventually reaching [[Firefist]], a satellite galaxy that contained the homeworld of his mother's people.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> Bad [[Starship/Legends|starship]] instruments and a stroke of luck brought him to the planet of [[Nagi]], where he crash-landed.<ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" /> Bey was soon encountered by a Nagai resistance group that was busy fighting their \"old enemy\", the [[Tof]].<ref name=\"Tof\" /> To his surprise, the local Nagai accepted him without reservation, treating him as an equal. The Nagai who had discovered him quickly reunited him with his long-lost mother who was residing on a nearby Nagai colony world. Even though she had her own family there, including another son, [[Ozrei N'takkilomandrife]], she accepted Bey into her family. Bey was touched by the friendliness of the Nagai, and decided to join them. With the Galactic Empire reeling from its loss at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the Nagai were planning to begin their invasion. Bey agreed to help, using his reputation to infiltrate the larger galaxy and work as a double agent for his people.<ref name=\"Tof\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" /><ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\n===Infiltrating the Alliance===\n{{Quote|You're still your usual self, Han. Haven't you learned yet? If you care for someone treat her well. Tell her that you care.''\"<br />\"''I don't have to tell Leia! She knows how I feel!''\"<br />\"''Mmm?''\"<br />\"''That's enough!|Bey and Han Solo reunite|Star Wars (1977) 101: Far, Far Away}}\n[[File:BeyFenn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bey, Fenn Shysa, and Leia Organa watch as the ''Millennium Falcon'' disappears.]]\nBey returned to Alliance space and met up with [[Fenn Shysa]] on [[Mandalore/Legends|Mandalore]]. As the Nagai began to attack worlds near Mandalore, Bey aided Shysa in setting up resistance groups to the growing threat, using the opportunity to gain the Mandalorian's trust. Nagai analysts believed the Mandalorians would eventually join the Alliance, allowing Bey, as their spy, to infiltrate their enemy indirectly.<ref name=\"Tof\" /><ref name=\"Touch of the Goddess\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" /> Following the [[Battle of Mandalore (Nagai invasion)|Battle of Mandalore]], in which Bey played a part in the resistance,<ref name=\"Tof\" /> Shysa decided to appeal to the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] for help, following a request from [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] for additional soldiers. Bey, realizing his chance to infiltrate the [[Alliance High Command/Legends|Alliance High Command]] was present, left Mandalore with Shysa and a contingent of [[Mandalorian Protectors/Legends|Mandalorian Protectors]]. The group arrived at the Alliance's base on the [[Endor/Legends|forest moon of Endor]] and sought out [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] to see how they could help.<ref name=\"Touch of the Goddess\" /><ref name=\"Far, Far Away\" />\n\nHowever, when Shysa and Bey finally found Organa, she was involved in an argument with Han Solo over his role in the new government. When Solo grabbed the Princess to make sure his point was well heard, he was grabbed from behind and thrown to the ground. Shysa, believing that Solo was hurting Organa, had come to her rescue. As the Princess took Shysa aside to explain the argument and to debrief the Mandalorian on the current situation, Bey met up with his longtime friend, who had a bruised ego more than anything else. Bey teased his friend about his relationship with the Princess, reminding Solo that if he cared for the Princess, he needed to treat her well and tell her how he felt. Solo shrugged off the advice, claiming that Organa knew how he felt about her, ignoring Bey's advice.<ref name=\"Far, Far Away\" />\n\nA short time later, Bey and Shysa joined the Princess aboard a [[GR-75 medium transport/Legends|GR-75 medium transport]] shadowing the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] as it began to investigate mysterious balls of energy that had been appearing throughout the [[Moddell sector/Legends|Moddell sector]]. When the ''Millennium Falcon'' approached one of the balls, a tendril of energy struck the ship, transporting it to a [[Technology-deficient planet|far-off world]]. Bey was puzzled by his friend's disappearance, but Solo eventually made his way back to the base. While away, Solo took Bey's advice to heart, and when he returned he told the Princess how he felt.<ref name=\"Far, Far Away\" />\n\n===Crisis on Godo===\n{{Quote|So, Bey. You got any bright ideas? You're the big hero of song and legend. So&hellip;what do we do, saddled with responsibility for a bunch of aliens who look and act like sick kids? And, don't go lookin' at me! I hate kids.''\"<br />\"''I know. I hate seeing them like this, too.|Han Solo and Bey discuss the crisis on Godo|Star Wars (1977) 99: Touch of the Goddess}}\n[[File:BeySpace.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Bey encourages Fenn Shysa to join Han Solo's cause.]]\n\nA short time after Solo returned, Bey accompanied him to the planet [[Godo]] along with [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and Ackbar. The native [[Godoan/Legends|Godoans]] were slowly dying out due to a [[Godoan's disease|strange technovirus]] that affected anyone who arrived on the world. To protect from the virus, Bey and the rest of the group took protective precontainment [[Radiation/Legends|radiation]] baths before they landed on the planet. After unloading boxes of supplies for the ailing Godoans, Solo requested to look around, eventually coming upon the [[House of the Goddess]], the most sacred building on the planet. As Bey and the rest of the travelers explored the building, Solo realized that the temple was a techno-organic construct. The structure was actually a machine designed to sustain life on the planet. However, two pieces from the building, the [[Dancing Goddess/Legends|Dancing Goddess]] and the [[Minstrel]], had been removed, rendering the machine inactive. Solo, having seen the two pieces during his [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] days, and, believing them to be in [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian's]] possession, raced back to the Alliance base to ask Calrissian for the two objects.<ref name=\"Touch of the Goddess\" />\n\nUnfortunately for the Godoans, Calrissian did not have the pieces, one having been stolen by a gang led by [[Lemo]] and [[Sanda]], two pirates who operated in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]], and the other having been given to [[Barpotomous Drebble/Legends|Barpotomous Drebble]], a friend of the Alliance, as a gift. As Solo, Calrissian, Chewbacca, and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] left on a mission to retrieve the artifacts, Bey stayed with the [[Alliance Fleet]], anticipating their return. In space, alongside Fenn Shysa, Bey watched as Solo and Skywalker returned with the Minstrel, and Calrissian and Chewbacca returned with the Dancing Goddess. With the two pieces replaced, the House of the Goddess began to function again, reviving the sick Godoans. However, in Calrissian's haste to bring the Dancing Goddess to the world, he had forgotten to take a precontainment radiation bath beforehand. Sick and near death, Calrissian's only chance revolved around being brought inside the House of the Goddess in hopes that it would cure him. Unfortunately for Calrissian, the Godoans, frightened over the possibility of the structure being defiled again, had sealed the House of the Goddess from all offworlders, effectively condemning Calrissian to death. Solo, furious over the turn of events, declared that he would open fire on the Godoans' capital city and destroy their sacred building if they would not heal Calrissian. Although Ackbar condemned the action, Solo was able to secure the cooperation of several members of the [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]]. Following encouragement by Bey, Shysa agreed to cooperate as well. Threatened with the destruction of their temple, the Godoans agreed to allow Calrissian to land, ending the crisis. Ackbar decided to overlook the actions of the complicit parties due to no harm being done, exonerating Bey and Shysa from blame.<ref name=\"Touch of the Goddess\" />\n\n===Nagai-Tof War===\n{{Quote|Why?! Bey, why are you doing this? Why are you siding with the Nagai against us, against your own people?''\"<br />\"''My people, Han? The Nagai are my people&hellip;more than the Alliance&hellip;more than anyone but you&hellip;certainly more than the Corellians.|Han Solo and Bey, during the Second Battle of Endor|Star Wars (1977) 100: First Strike}}\n[[File:BeyHanfight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bey and Han Solo brawl on the forest floor.]]\n\nFollowing the crisis on Godo, Bey and his companions returned to the Alliance base on Endor. While many of the Alliance soldiers, including Solo and Shysa, began taking [[Computer/Legends|computerized]] flight exams, Bey sat out on the tests, never having been much of a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]].<ref name=\"First Strike\" /> Following the tests, a group of [[Hoojib/Legends|Hoojibs]] led by [[Plif]] discovered a secret from the Nagai captured in the [[Skirmish on Kabray]]. The Nagai were planning to attack the Alliance's base on Endor.<ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" /> Organa and her [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] attach\u00e9s confirmed the report when they detected a large group of ships heading for the forest moon, and the Alliance prepared to evacuate. The Alliance Fleet readied itself to cover their evacuating personnel, but without the help of Solo and Skywalker. The earlier flight exams had categorized the two pilots as flying their craft in ways that no sane pilot would attempt. The computer would not allow either Solo or Skywalker to pilot a ship, keeping the two out of the upcoming fighting.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nAs the Alliance scrambled to counter the Nagai threat, Bey used the distraction to help his true allies. Bey freed the Nagai prisoners, including his half-brother, N'takkilomandrife. The Nagai commander took control of a Nagai task force, including [[Maccabree|Maccabree warriors]] that had landed secretly on the forest moon. Bey then turned over the Alliance's flight patterns to the Nagai fleet in space, led by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lady]] [[Lumiya]]. With the Nagai able to predict the Alliance Fleet's every move, preventing the Alliance Command from evacuating safely, N'takkilomandrife's team was given time to advance on their position and take them out.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nThe initial stages of the battle worked to perfection, allowing the Nagai to easily overwhelm their opponents. The Alliance Fleet, led by Shysa and Calrissian, were slowly wiped out, and Maccabree warriors under [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Hol B'shaki]] attacked the tracking station, surrounding Organa and her Zeltron attach\u00e9s, who struggled to fight back. However, Solo and Skywalker, who had been grounded, disrupted the plan. Exploring the forests on a tip from the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Tippet]], the two Alliance heroes came upon the Nagai ground forces' staging point, discovering their plan. While Skywalker raced back to the Alliance headquarters to warn them of the ambush, Solo was attacked by a Maccabree warrior, losing his [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] in the process. Although he dispatched his attacker, Solo was forced to make his way back on foot, where he was cut off by Bey.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\n[[File:BeyBlaster.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bey turns his blaster on Han Solo.]]\nSolo gestured frantically at his friend, requesting that he help him warn Organa before it was too late. After finding no help from Bey, Solo tried to shrug off the larger man, pushing him aside. However, Bey restrained Solo, informing him that he was the one who had brought the Nagai to the forest moon. Solo, shocked at the revelation, slowly reached for his blaster, only to have it knocked out of his grip when he tried to pull it out of its holster. The two stared each other down, with Solo declaring his intention to rescue his friends, even if he had to go through his old friend to do so. Solo tried a low leg sweep, but Bey vaulted the blow and kicked Solo in the face, leaving him sprawling on the forest floor.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nBey explained to his friend how he had found his true family, and that they had accepted him as one of their own, triggering the betrayal. When Solo asked his friend what would happen next, Bey informed Solo that he had been ordered to kill him. However, Bey could not bring himself to murder his old friend, leaving both unsure of what was to happen next. However, at just that moment, Bey's half-brother appeared, claiming that he would finish what Bey had started, and trained his blaster on the unarmed Solo. However, before N'takkilomandrife could pull the trigger, Bey threw himself at his brother, knocking him off balance. The Nagai quickly turned his blaster on Bey, preparing to execute the traitor, but he was once again prevented from firing the fatal shot as Solo hit N'takkilomandrife in the stomach with a blaster shot.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nBey ran to his injured brother, telling him to hang on until he could get him medical attention. Solo advanced on his injured enemy, telling Bey to step aside. However, Bey trained his brother's blaster at Solo, telling him to leave or he would shoot him. Solo was confused over Bey's actions, pointing out that the Nagai had nearly killed both of them. However, Bey remarked that he would be able to forgive his brother, though he realized that the Nagai might never forgive him. Solo left Bey to tend to his wounded brother, leaving to rescue Organa from the Nagai task force.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nWith Bey revealed as the traitor, and the Alliance Fleet informed of their flight plans being discovered by the Nagai, the tide quickly turned. Calrissian abandoned all preconceived flight patterns, changing the course of the space battle, while Skywalker defeated the Nagai task force on the ground. Bey was able to get his brother back to the fleet, where he received immediate medical aid, and the Nagai fleet retreated in defeat.<ref name=\"First Strike\" /> Bey, having betrayed both the Nagai and the Alliance, secretly turned himself into Admiral Ackbar.<ref name=\"Tof\" />\n\n===The Battle of Saijo===\n{{Quote|I came here to protect both my brothers.

Bey decided to work alongside the team, going undercover as a Tof noble.

However, their deception was revealed, and a shootout broke out in the throne room. Unfortunately for the Alliance operatives, the Dark Lady Lumiya was holding an audience with Sereno at the exact same time, and she used her [[The Force/Legends|Force]] abilities to turn the tide of the battle, stunning N'takkilomandrife and disarming Organa. However, before she could kill either of them, Bey intervened, shooting Lumiya with a powerful blaster shot, badly crippling her and leaving her a smoking mess on the palace floor. As the rest of the group silenced any further resistance, Bey revealed his presence to the surprise of both Solo and N'takkilomandrife. Bey's half-brother was touched by how his sibling had rescued him, and he came to forgive Bey for his betrayal. With the Tof Prince captured and their fleet defeated in space, the war was effectively over.<ref name=\"All Together Now\" />\n\n===End of the War===\nFollowing the end of the war, both Solo and N'takkilomandrife reconciled with Bey. Bey did not join the Nagai in their quest to liberate their homeworld, leaving the operation up to his brother and Fenn Shysa. When the Alliance of Free Planets reformed itself into the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], Bey joined up, taking a job with [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" /> Bey believed this appointment to be apart of his atonement for the destruction he had been responsible for at Endor.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> It appeared that Bey's days of wandering were at an end.<ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I keep learning.

Based on his abusive childhood, Bey swore not to emulate his wrathful father, and he developed a persona that was soft-spoken and sympathetic.<ref name=\"Tof\" /> He did not hesitate to rescue Han Solo from bullies during his early days and became well known for his helpful nature. Bey was a passionless fighter, refusing to let anger guide his actions during combat. However, even though he was known as a near mythological figure for the feats he had accomplished, Bey harbored feelings of resentment towards those that he rescued. As a young boy, he was spurned by his father, who was distraught over the loss of Bey's mother. Other [[Corellian/Legends|Corellians]] looked down on Bey for being a half-breed, and young children feared him due to his odd looks and large size. Perhaps due to these factors, Bey could find no acceptance among the people he helped, and he began to see them as judgmental and unkind, saving their hospitality until they needed Bey to accomplish something for them.<ref name=\"First Strike\" />\n\nWhen Bey discovered his mother on her home planet of Nagi, Bey finally found the acceptance he had been looking for, and his desire for it even made him turn against the people of the Alliance.<ref name=\"Star Wars Gamer 1\" /><ref name=\"First Strike\" /> Working alongside the invading Nagai, Bey turned against those he had formerly fought to defend. However, Bey still retained his compassion, refusing to adopt the cold-hearted nature of his Nagai brethren. He was unable to kill Solo during the Second Battle of Endor, and his mercy brought him into conflict with his own half-brother.<ref name=\"First Strike\" /> Following the end of the Nagai-Tof War, Bey was able to find his brother's forgiveness after saving his life in the Battle of Saijo. Bey's loving nature following this battle convinced Solo that the war was truly at an end.<ref name=\"All Together Now\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:BeyFizzace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bey during the Second Battle of Endor.]]\n\nBey was created by [[Mary Jo Duffy]] for use in the [[Star Wars (1977)|''Marvel Star Wars'']] comic [[Star Wars (1977) 99|''Star Wars'' (1977) 99]], which explained that Bey was an old friend of Han Solo's. Several flashbacks in the following issue, [[Star Wars (1977) 100|''Star Wars'' (1977) 100]], served to show how Bey had interacted with Solo during his young life. The next issue, [[Star Wars (1977) 101|''Star Wars'' (1977) 101]] was set before the events of Bey's first appearance in ''Touch of the Goddess'', and it would be the last appearance of Bey until the last issue of the Marvel run, [[Star Wars (1977) 107|''Star Wars'' (1977) 107]]. Following this, Bey went unreferenced until [[Joseph Bongiorno]] and [[Rich Handley]]'s article in [[Star Wars Gamer|''Star Wars Gamer'' 1]], ''[[The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Marvel Series]]'', which expanded on Bey's backstory. The article revealed the name of Bey's mother, as well as explaining how Bey had met up with his family before the Nagai-Tof War. Bey had another mention in [[Abel G. Pe\u00f1a]]'s online article, ''[[The Dark Forces Saga]]'', which stated that Bey was acquainted with [[Kyle Katarn]]. In [[2009]], a [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] article, ''[[The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs]]'' by [[James McFadden]] gave additional details on Bey's history. Among these were detailed information of the event that took Bey's eye and a more in-depth account of Bey's eventual discovery of his long-lost mother.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 101|''Star Wars'' (1977) 101]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 99|''Star Wars'' (1977) 99]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 100|''Star Wars'' (1977) 100]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 107|''Star Wars'' (1977) 107]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|1|The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Marvel Series}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050407a|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 1|int=The Dark Forces Saga|archivedate=20100501063232}}\n*{{InsiderCite|91|Comic Marvels}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/source/nagai11202009/index.html|text=The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs|int=The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs}}\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-guide-to-warfare-authors-cut-part-12-tales-of-the-new-republic|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'' Author's Cut, Part 12: Tales Of The New Republic|int=Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n[[Category:Near-Human Hybrids]]\n[[Category:New Republic Intelligence personnel]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
