She spent a good deal of [[Time/Legends|time]] flirting with [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], much to the chagrin of her jealous boyfriend, [[Brooser]], who was known to start physical altercations with others due to Jezzable's provocations.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in the final [[Time/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]]<ref name=\"age\" /> on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Celanon/Legends|Celanon]], Jezzable was a twenty-seven-[[Standard year/Legends|year]]-old [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]]<ref name=\"TRP\" /> during the early years of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"era\">''[[The Politics of Contraband]]''</ref> With long flowing [[Color/Legends|red]] hair and green [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and possessing a flawless complexion with a captivating silhouette,<ref name=\"TRP\" /> Jezzable was an alluring figure as she flirted with [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] visiting the various [[Cantina/Legends|bars]] in [[Celanon City]].<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|161|Jezzable}}</ref> Jezzable's physical attributes, coupled with her provocative demeanor toward the opposite sex, greatly distressed her jealous boyfriend, [[Brooser]].<ref name=\"TRP\" /><ref name=\"PoC\">{{WEGCite|book=The Politics of Contraband|story=The Right Place ...}}</ref>\n\n{{RPGseed}}\nOne afternoon, Jezzable was patronizing [[Gularg's Libation Emporium]] when a pair of [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] entered the establishment. Not long after, she had a [[Alcohol/Legends|drink]] delivered to one of the smugglers. When he inquired as to whom had sent the beverage, [[Gularg]], the bar's owner, pointed to Jezzable. Within a few [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]], she had joined the smuggler's table and pleasantly chatted with him until Brooser noticed and became physically violent. Additional bar occupants became involved in the fray until [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] weapons were drawn. At that point, Gularg&mdash;who did not condone the use of blasters in his bar&mdash;disarmed the opponents and ended the altercation.<ref name=\"PoC\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJezzable was a gorgeous woman who loved, and excelled at, flirting with members of the opposite sex, caring little as to how her actions affected her boyfriend&mdash;she did not understand the meaning of loyalty. Rather, she adored having males of all [[Species/Legends|species]] fight over her. Jezzable was considered naive by most individuals; however, she possessed a good deal of common sense and was adept at talking or bargaining her way through most situations. Jezzable was also experienced with firearms, and the items she most often carried on her person included a makeup bag, clutch purse, and [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]].<ref name=\"TRP\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJezzable first appeared in ''[[The Right Place ...]]'', one of the five adventure scenarios written for ''[[The Politics of Contraband]]'', a [[1992]] [[West End Games]] supplement for ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]''. Her scenario and character were also reprinted in ''[[Classic Adventures]]'', published in [[1995]]. Jezzable later received an entry in [[2008]]'s ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\nAlthough Jezzable is a character that appears in ''The Right Place ...'' and can be interacted with to a limited degree, it is the Gamemaster's discretion as to whether the player will participate in the mini-scenario, ''Flirtatious advance'', in which Jezzable has the drink delivered to the player. If it is decided that the scenario will be used, then the scenario ''Punched out!'', involving Brooser, will automatically follow, as this is the conclusion to ''Flirtatious advance''.<ref name=\"PoC\" />\n\nJezzable's character template type is listed as \"Floozie\" in ''The Politics of Contraband'',<ref name=\"TRP\" /> which is not one of the standard templates found in ''The Roleplaying Game''.<ref name=\"RPG1\">[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game (first edition)|''Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game'']]</ref><ref name=\"RPG2\">''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition]]''</ref><ref name=\"RPG2EE\">''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''</ref> Neither was the template present in ''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'', a West End Games character creation and template supplement.<ref>''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''</ref> However, as it is possible for a player to create a new template for their own individual characters, \"Floozie\" may be used as an example template in generating a unique template or character.<ref name=\"RPG1\" /><ref name=\"RPG2\" /><ref name=\"RPG2EE\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Politics of Contraband|story=The Right Place ...}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Classic Adventures|story=The Right Place ...}} {{C|Republished}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Celanon residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
