On Visquis' orders, the Quarren deliberately mistreated the refugees, cutting the living spaces allotted to them by half, on top of that claimed by the [[Serroco (gang)|Serroco]] gang. Included among his retinue of enforcers and bodyguards were over a dozen [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorreans]], as well as a number of [[Weequay/Legends|Weequay]] and [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] thugs.\n\nSaquesh attempted to use the refugees as [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]], kidnapping a child named [[Adana (Human)|Adana]] in order to sell her to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]]. Concerned for the well-being of the refugees, [[Meetra Surik]] convinced Saquesh to release Adana.\n\nThe Quarren made no effort to hide his disdain for humans, but he despised them- mainly the refugees- for being weak, not simply for being human.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the non-canon [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] storyline, Meetra Surik may side with him and assist his operations in the [[Refugee Sector]].\n\nAnother option allows Surik to intimidate Saquesh by either demanding that the Quarren ease his grip on the refugees or Surik will be forced to kill him. This gives the player [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] points, however this causes Saquesh and his thugs to attack.\n\nSurik may also have killed him if she was caught stealing their supplies or failed to intimidate him into freeing Adana.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Saquesh\n|hu=Saquesh\n}}\n\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Quarren]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]"}}}]}}}}
