During that time, he was part of spy network that also included [[Kaesii DuPree]] and the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Lercer Gaia]].<ref name=\"SWG:PtB\" />\n\nAround [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> a marginal Tatooinian [[Eyan McDermitt's pirate gang|gang]] of [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] hijacked a courier ship belonging to the [[Incom Corporation/Legends|Incom Corporation]]. The pirates were only after general cargo but they also stole an encrypted [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] with information about a new product Incom was developing. An influential member of the Incom Corporation therefore contacted Sarlis Beni to retrieve the datapad. Lercer Gaia sent a spy to meet with Sarlis in Mos Entha, upon the recommendation of Kaesii DuPree.<ref name=\"SWG:PtB\" /> Sarlis tasked the spy with going to [[Mos Taike/Legends|Mos Taike]] to confront the pirates. After speaking to to their leader, [[Eyan McDermitt]], the spy learned that he would need to go to the [[Imperial Oasis]] to find an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Commando/Legends|commando]] by the name [[Jubai Laetlii]] who was in possession of  the datapad. The spy succeeded in stealing the datapad from Jubai unnoticed and delivered it back to Sarlis. Sarlis Beni eventually returned the datapad to his contact from Incom who confirmed the data and paid the spies for their services.<ref name=\"SWG:CE\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Spy|Corporate Espionage|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSarlis Beni was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:PtB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Sarlis Beni was added to the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Corporate Espionage}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beni, Sarlis}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
