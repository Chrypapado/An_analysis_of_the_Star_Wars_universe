He left [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] at a young age seeking adventure and enrolled at one flight school after another. He tried to learn how to fly every type of [[Starship/Legends|ship]] he could, but his favorite were [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]].\n\nWhen Piknab was twenty-five, he bought his own starfighter, the ''[[Gungan Glory]]'', getting financing from [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] and his [[Smugglers' Confederation]]. Despite his ace piloting skills, he ended up delinquent on a few payments. When the enforcers came and wanted to cut off his ears, he agreed to pay off his debt by working for Riboga and the Smugglers' Confederation. Even after Riboga left the system in [[53 BBY/Legends|53 BBY]], Piknab was working off his debt.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carsels, Piknab}}\n[[Category:Genarius residents]]\n[[Category:Gungans of unspecified race]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
