Residing on the [[Fuel|refueling]] platform ''[[Colossus]]'', she owned [[Aunt Z's Tavern|a popular tavern]] where fellow station residents could eat, drink or seek advice from the [[Restaurant|tavern]] owner. After the [[First Order]] [[Occupation of the Colossus|occupied]] the ''Colossus'', Aunt Z was arrested for vocally expressing her dislike of the First Order. After [[Kazuda Xiono]] and [[Torra Doza]] [[Rescue on the Colossus|helped]] Aunt Z, [[Hype Fazon]], [[Grevel]], and [[Nod]] overcome their [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] guards to escape the planet in a stolen transport, Aunt Z decided that the pair would go to [[Takodana]] and hide out with a friend of hers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Enter Kaz===\n{{Quote|Ah! This is Aunt Z. Proprietor of this fine eating establishment.|Neeku Vozo, introducing Aunt Z to Kazuda Xiono|The Recruit}}\n[[File:Aunt_Z.jpg|thumb|250px|Aunt Z's Tavern]]\nAunt Z, originally from the [[planet]] [[Crul]],<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> owned [[Aunt Z's Tavern|a]] [[Cantina|tavern]] on the ''[[Colossus]]'', an independent [[refueling station]] on [[Castilon]]. She also had several [[service droid]]s including [[G1-7CH]] \"Glitch\" and ran the betting pool for when races took place. At some point, the [[Resistance]] [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]] approached her with one of his new spies, [[Kazuda Xiono]]. They were looking for Poe's friend [[Jarek Yeager]]. Aunt Z led them to Yeager and Poe left with him, leaving Xiono at the tavern. Xiono decided to play [[holodarts]] with an [[Aleen]] named [[Grevel]], but Grevel sabotaged his dart, making it fly into the [[Klatooinian]] [[Bolza Grool]]'s back.<ref name=\"Recruit\" />\n\nGrool started a fight with Xiono and the residents of the bar joined in until Yeager returned to restore order. Shortly after, when [[Neeku Vozo]] decided to help Xiono get a start to his racing career by announcing he would be challenging solo the next day, Aunt Z quickly opened up bets. Xiono attempted to tell her he didn't want to race, but Yeager told him he couldn't as Grool would throw him off the platform if he refused to race.<ref name=\"Recruit\" />\n\n===Rascally Rucklin===\nWhen Kaz struggled to fit into [[Jarek Yeager's Repair Station|Yeager's repair shop]], he visited Aunt Z's Tavern to seek solace. When Kaz vented his frustration with Yeager, Aunt Z opined that Yeager may not be the best option and suggested looking for other accommodation. That same day, Kaz was befriended by the unscrupulous racer [[Jace Rucklin]] and [[Jace Rucklin's racing team|his racing team]], who tried to steal a bottle of [[Coaxium|hyperfuel]] from Kaz's employer Yeager.<ref name=\"Fuel for the Fire\">{{Resistance|Fuel for the Fire}}</ref>\n\n===Blackouts===\nWhen blackouts started occurring on the ''Colossus'' due to a fuel shortage, she told Xiono, [[Tamara Ryvora]] and Vozo that she believed they were intentionally being caused by [[Captain]] [[Imanuel Doza]] because she thought he worked for the [[First Order]], which inspired Xiono to [[Mission to Doza Tower|sneak into]] [[Doza Tower]] and spy on Doza's meeting with [[Major]] [[Elrik Vonreg]]. Later, Kaz was pursued by stormtroopers while navigating through the ledges of Doza Tower. Aunt Z was unsympathetic to his dire situation and bet 20 [[credit]]s that he would fall to his death, something that was quickly taken up by the other patrons. Nevertheless, she cheered him on and seemed quite happy when Kaz managed to escape the stormtroopers with the help of the [[BB-series astromech droid|BB unit]] [[BB-8]], whom Poe assigned to look after Kaz.<ref name=\"The High Tower\">{{Resistance|The High Tower}}</ref>\n\n===Refugees from Tehar===\nAfter incurring the wrath of Tam for accidentally damaging an [[acceleration compensator]], Kaz visited Aunt Z's Tavern seeking solace. Kaz ordered a drink of water from Aunt Z but she tried to take it away when Kaz did not pay the full amount. Neeku then took pity on Kaz and paid the full bill, prompting Aunt Z to praise Neeku for being a good friend. While visiting the cantina, Kaz learnt about a bounty on two children and decided to rescue the children in order to purchase a new acceleration compensator for Tam. Kaz and his friends learnt that the children [[Kel]] and [[Eila]] had fled a [[Massacre on Tehar|massacre]] on Tehar and helped them hide from the First Order with the [[Chelidae]], the \"shell folk\" who worked as engineers in the ''Colossus''' engineering deck.<ref name=\"Children from Tehar\">{{Resistance|The Children from Tehar}}</ref>\n\n===BB-8's errand===\nLater, when [[BB-8]] stopped by her tavern looking for Xiono, she told the droid she hadn't seen him that day. BB-8 returned to Yeager's repairs only to discover that Kaz had been back at the workshop all that time.<ref name=\"The Search for Kaz\">{{Resistance|The Search for Kaz}}</ref>\n\n===The Platform Classic===\nWhen the [[Platform Classic]] was held, after Yeager was successfully goaded by his employees into challenging his brother [[Marcus Speedstar]] in the race, Aunt Z was quick to open up betting, prompting Xiono, reminded of what had happened to him on his first day on the platform, to smugly remind Yeager that he couldn't back out once he had agreed to race.<ref name=\"The Platform Classic\">{{Resistance|The Platform Classic}}</ref>\n\n===A game of holo-darts===\nAunt Z was present when Kaz, [[Torra Doza]], Neeku, BB-8, [[R1-J5]] \"Bucket,\" [[Bolza Grool]], and [[Al]] played a game of [[holo-darts]]. Kaz had three attempts but failed to hit the bullseye. Bucket then had a go. His first two shots hit the bull's eye but the third holo-dart ricocheted off the board and around the tavern. Aunt Z offhandedly deflected the dart with a tray whilst talking to a female human patron, causing it to strike Kaz in the buttocks.<ref name=\"Dart and Cover\">{{Resistance|Dart and Cover}}</ref>\n\n===G-LN's escapade===\nLater, Aunt Z was serving the shopkeepers [[Flix]] and [[Orka]], who were accompanied by their [[DUM-series pit droid|pit droid]] [[G-LN]]. When Orka served G-LN some [[Blurrgfire]], the pit droid went hyperactive and accosted two [[service droid]]s including Glitch and Bolza Grool. While Aunt Z was conversing with her guests, the service droids and Grool ganged up on G-LN and roughed him up.<ref name=\"G-LN\">{{Resistance|G-LN (episode)|G-LN}}</ref>\n\n===The approaching storm===\nAunt Z sold Kaz a drink while Torra and Tam played a game of holodarts. Shortly later, [[Synara San]] entered Aunt Z's Tavern and Torra invited her for a game of [[Drone-Blaster]]. Unknown to everyone, Synara was a pirate and member of [[Kragan Gorr]]'s [[Warbird gang]]. Gaining Torra's trust, Synara gained access to [[Doza Tower]] and helped her pirate associates [[Kidnapping of Torra Doza|kidnap]] Torra. Torra was subsequently rescued by the First Order, who used it to convince [[Captain]] [[Imanuel Doza]] to acquiesce to the First Order's [[Occupation of the Colossus|occupation]] of the ''Colossus''.<ref name=\"The Doza Dilemma\">{{Resistance|The Doza Dilemma}}</ref>\n\n===Escaping the First Order===\nUnlike most of the ''Colossus''<nowiki/>' residents who were either supportive or dismissive towards it, Aunt Z was openly unhappy and hostile regarding the First Order occupation, especially when [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] forced her to display [[propaganda]] in her tavern after claiming it didn't match her d\u00e9cor. Eventually, her refusal to be silent about her dislike for them led to her throwing the [[datapad]] displaying the propaganda at a stormtrooper patrol, after loudly proclaiming her belief that the First Order was responsible for the disappearances of ''Colossus'' residents including top [[Ace Squadron|Ace]] [[Hype Fazon]]. Later that same day, she was arrested, leading to her droid Glitch being overwhelmed while having to run the tavern by himself, allowing the First Order to place as many propaganda projectors as they pleased..<ref name=\"The Disappeared\">{{Resistance|The Disappeared}}</ref>\n\nAunt Z was placed in the same cargo container where Fazon, along with Grevel and [[Nod]], were being held after their own arrests for similarly hostile behaviour towards the First Order. The Gilliand refused to remain quiet or docile about her confinement, demanding to be let out, and even used Fazon as an unwilling stepladder (much to the Rodian's discomfort as she was much heavier than him) to interrogate the troopers guarding the container, whereupon she was told that she and the others would be shipped offworld. Xiono resolved to do something, and along with Torra and [[CB-23]], headed to the west docks to [[Rescue on the Colossus|rescue]] the prisoners after being told where they were by Yeager and Captain Doza. He told Aunt Z, who once again used the unwilling Fazon as a footstool to reach a vent hole in the container, that the plan was for her and her fellow prisoners to get onto the First Order transport before Xiono and Torra helped them overpower their guards so they could steal the ship, as the ''Colossus'' would be torn apart in a search if they broke them out now. The rescue plan went off without a hitch, and Fazon volunteered to fly the stolen transport. Aunt Z told Xiono that the escapees would go to [[Takodana]], where she had a friend who could help them.<ref name=\"The Disappeared\" />\n\nAunt Z and Fazon later returned just in time to aid Xiono and the rest of the ''Colossus'' in escaping the planet and the First Order.<ref name=\"No Escape 2\">{{Resistance|No Escape: Part 2}}</ref> She then went back to work in her tavern, serving up a \"Zero-G Special\" while the ''Colossus'' was stuck in space without [[coaxium]] and with multiple system failures.<ref name=\"Into the Unknown\">{{Resistance|Into the Unknown}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, the ''Colossus'' having been forced on the run into space meant that supplies of food and drink quickly ran out and many residents became unhappy with Captain Doza, Aunt Z among them. Reasoning that she couldn't stay if she couldn't run her business, Aunt Z prepared to leave the station but was persuaded by Torra and Kaz to stay if they could hunt and kill a [[jakoosk]], a creature native to the nearby moon [[Celsor 3]] that could keep the residents fed for a good long while. She offered [[Kragan Gorr]] and his [[Warbird gang]] free drinks if they could bring the beast down, but ultimately it was Torra and Kaz who did the deed, for which she warmly thanked them and agreed to stay for now.<ref>''[[Star Wars Resistance]]'' - \"''[[Hunt on Celsor 3]]''\"</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAunt Z was a female Gilliand with [[Color|black]] [[eye]]s and light skin.<ref name=\"Recruit\" /> She was [[tattoo]]ed on the upper left arm with a [[space waffle]] adorned with a crossed knife and spatula.<ref name=\"High Tower BL\">{{SW|url=news/buckets-list-extra-the-high-tower-star-wars-resistance|text=Bucket's List Extra: 9 Fun Facts from \"The High Tower\" - ''Star Wars Resistance''}}</ref> She disliked the First Order, and her refusal to be silent about this led to her arrest when their forces occupied the ''Colossus''. As a result, after Xiono and Torra helped her and her fellow prisoners escape, she was forced to leave Castilon and go into hiding, intending to ask a friend of hers on Takodana for help.<ref name=\"The Disappeared\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nZ'Vk'Thkrkza, or \"Aunt Z,\" is a character created and developed for the ''[[Star Wars Resistance]]'' animated series.
