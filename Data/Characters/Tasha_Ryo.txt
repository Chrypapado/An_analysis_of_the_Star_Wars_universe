My mother ''and'' father... I can never satisfy both... Never satisfy either. Bound to both by duty... Torn by duty...|Tasha Ryo|Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4}}\n'''Tasha Ryo''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Je'daii Journeyer]] who served the [[Je'daii Order]] on [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] at the height of the [[Infinite Empire]]'s reign.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] of the [[Ryo Clan]], Tasha Ryo was the daughter of [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Volnos Ryo]] of [[Shikaakwa]] and [[Je'daii Temple Master]] [[Kora Ryo]], archmaster of the Great Temple of Knowledge, [[Kaleth]]. Upon coming of age, Ryo was trained in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Je'daii Order]] on the planet [[Tython/Legends|Tython]], one of nine planets in the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]] which made up the [[Settled Worlds]]. Preferring to use her Force skills rather than any weapons to defend herself, Ryo achieved the rank of [[Je'daii Journeyer|Journeyer]] within the Order. Throughout her life, Ryo constantly struggled with her duties to the Order and the demands of her father, who wished she would join his criminal empire on Shikaakwa.<ref name=\"DotJ2\" />\n\n===A Dark stranger arrives===\nWhile saving her father from an [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] within his own [[Ryo Fortress|fortress]], Ryo received a vision of a mysterious man named [[Tau (individual)|Xesh]], a [[Force Hound]] of the [[Infinite Empire]], who would crash the [[Rakatan ship]] called the ''[[Devourer]]'' near the [[Rift]] on Tython. The surge of [[Death/Legends|deaths]] associated with the crash alerted all Je'daii to the foreign presence on the world, as well as stirring a [[Force storm (weather)|Force storm]] that would rage across the entire planet. Sensing the disturbance through a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] while fighting off the [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] killer, Ryo was decided to follow the vision to where ever it may lead in order to maintain balance in the Force.<ref name=\"DotJ2\" />\n\n[[File:Seknos-Tasha-Shae-DotJ2.png|thumb|left|Sek'nos Rath, Tasha Ryo and Shar Koda, moments before meeting the Force Hound Xesh.]]\nAt the crash site, Ryo met fellow Journeyers [[Sek'nos Rath]] and [[Shae Koda]], both of whom had experience similar visions. Searching the wreckage of the alien ship, the trio discovered an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] carrying the stranger known as Xesh.<ref name=\"DotJ2\" /> Preparing to defend themselves, the Je'daii were shocked as [[Xesh's Forcesaber|Xesh's]] [[Forcesaber]] easily cut through Rath and Koda's [[Durasteel/Legends|durasteel]] blades, while his Force powers overwhelmed Ryo's. Despite the setback, the three Je'daii's combined mastery of the Force outmaneuvered Xesh and Koda was able to take the Forcesaber from his grasp. Unarmed and winded, the Je'daii forced Xesh deeper into the Rift towards the dangerous [[Abyss of Ruh]].<ref>[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 3]]</ref> While tracking the Force Hound, the three Je'daii experienced hallucinations brought on by the dark energies inside the Abyss. Ryo spiraled into depression when her fears of disappointing her parents were brought to the surface through the strange effects of the Abyss.\n\nFinding hope with the help of her allies, the trio was able to locate Xesh as he battled a saarl. When Rath's distraction only antagonized the beast, the group was forced to flee deeper into the cave. Making a final stand, Ryo and her allies attempted to hold off the beast but were unable to turn on the Forcesaber she had confiscated from Xesh. At the urging of her fellows, Koda relinquished possession of the saber to Xesh in hopes that he would activate it and kill the saarl; however Xesh took the weapon and abandoned the Je'daii to their fate. Unbeknownst to the journeyers, Xesh had stayed behind to watch the them fight. Ryo was hit by the saarl's lightning, but Rath came to her aid. When only Shae was left standing, Xesh then spontaneously aided her against the saarl, ultimately killing it. Weeks later, after Xesh was subdued, the three journeyers recuperated at [[Mahara Kesh]]. Tasha visited Xesh in his prison cell, requesting permission to look into his mind. The Twi'lek bore witness to Xesh's memories of the Infinite Empire and his upbringing.<ref>[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 4]]</ref>\n\n===Deciphering a mystery===\nLater, Rath, Koda, and Ryo were on [[Stav Kesh]] with [[Je'daii Master]] [[Tave]]. Tave found that they were to distracted with Xesh to think about there studies. Ryo asked why their vision and suggestions had been ignored. Tave assured them they were being listened to. He then told Rath and Koda to go to [[Vur Tepe]] and Tasha to [[Kaleth]]. <ref> [[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 1]]</ref>\n\nAt [[Kaleth]] Tasha looked for some evidence of the [[Rakata/Legends|mysterious aliens]] killed in the [[Devourer (Rakatan ship)|ship's]] crash, a species that was totally unknown to the Je'daii. At the same time [[Volnos Ryo|her father]] contacted [[Kora Ryo|her mother]] demanding she send Tasha to him. She refused. Meanwhile, Tasha found nothing. However, [[Je'daii Master|Master]] [[Ters Sendon]] arrived and stated he had something to show her. He took her to an ancient chamber beneath [[Kaleth]] which he believed predated the [[Tho Yor Arrival]]. He showed her a [[Kwa Holocron|holocron]] from which he had tried and failed to extract information. When Ryo touched it, however, the holocron's creator [[A'nang]] appeared before them.<ref> [[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 2]]</ref> A'nang explained to them how the [[Kwa]] had founded an advanced and benevolent [[Kwa holdings|interstellar civilization]]. A'nang spoke a [[The Force/Legends|\"Cosmic Power\"]] which Sendon believed was the Force. A'nang realized that if the holocron had been activated then some [[Force storm|catastrophe]] had occurred on Tython. Sendon told him about the strange ship and the storm. A'nang was silent. Ryo then showed A'nang the unidentified skull--in response to which A'nang cried \"[[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]]!\" and disappeared.<ref>[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 3]]</ref>\n\n===A new threat discovered===\nSome time later, in [[Je'daii Temple Master|Master]] [[Ketu]]'s chambers, they explained their discovery. Ketu introduced [[Rajivari]], who attempted to access the holocron. A'nang appeared to him and explained about the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] and their [[Infinite Empire]].<ref>[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 4]]</ref> Originally, the Kwa used [[Infinity Gate]]s to wander the galaxy, when they came across a primitive species, they would teach and help it develop. On one occasion, they came to a world known as [[Lehon]], populated by a species known as the Rakata. While the Rakata were primitive, they were extremely strong in the Force, so the Kwa decided to teach them about it, and to share their technological knowledge. Tragically, the Kwa were unaware of the Rakata's barbaric and aggressive nature. The Rakata abused the knowledge they were given to embark on a path of war and conquest, enslaving many species, and practicing only the Dark Side, as opposed to the Kwa's teachings of balance. Eventually, the Rakata coveted the Infinite Gate technology, which the Kwa refused to give to them, so the Rakata decided to try to take it, starting a devastating [[Kwa\u2013Rakata War|conflict]]. The war resulted in the downfall of the Kwa holdings, and the retreat of the majority of the species to their homeworld of Dathomir; however, the Kwa were at least able to disable the Infinity Gate network, preventing the Rakata from obtaining it.\n\n===Seer Tasha===\nAbout a year later, the Rakata invaded the Tython system. Tasha Ryo had then become a seer, and aided the Je'daii forces, led by Xesh and Daegen Lok, by sharing her visions. While the Je'daii forces made their all-or-nothing assault on the Rakata base on Ska Gora, she and the other seers had a vision of the Rakata attacking the Anil Kesh temple on Tython. Their vision was cut short when Xesh, who once again was a Force Hound of the Rakata, blinded them with the power of the dark side. Blinded both physically and mentally, she chose to stay on Tython and meditate on the holocron of A'nang. Predor Skal'nas eventually found the Kwa Infinity Gate deep in the chasm, and A'nang told Tasha that it was time for Tython to awaken, and asked her to take the holocron to the lowest level of Anil Kesh. Once there, Tasha stepped into the exploratory beam, reawakening her connection to the Force.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTasha Ryo was extremely proficient in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] especially in the use of [[Telekinesis/Legends|Telekinesis]]. When a talented assassin was sent to kill Volnos Ryo, she was able to detect his presence\nthrough the Force, saving her father in time. While fighting the assassin, she was also able to deflect his shots using her bare hands, right before disarming and knocking him down. She was also proficient with [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force_Push|Force Push]], which she demonstrated against Xesh. She, unlike other Je'daii Journeyers, didn't use any weapons besides the Force itself.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Tasha Ryo}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 2]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 3]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 4]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 5]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 1]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 2]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 3]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 4]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi: Force War]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0]]'' {{1stm}} {{1stp}}\n*{{InsiderCite|138|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.cbr.com/nycc-exclusive-ostrander-and-duursema-unveil-star-wars-dawn-of-the-jedi NYCC EXCLUSIVE: Ostrander and Duursema Unveil \"Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi\"] {{C|[https://web.archive.org/web/20200817183352/https://www.cbr.com/nycc-exclusive-ostrander-and-duursema-unveil-star-wars-dawn-of-the-jedi backup link]}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tasha Ryo#legends\n|ru=\u0422\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0420\u0451\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ryo, Tasha}}\n[[Category:Clan Ryo]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Je'daii Journeyers]]\n[[Category:Shikaakwa residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
