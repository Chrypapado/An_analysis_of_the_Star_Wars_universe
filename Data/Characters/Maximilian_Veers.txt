I ''will'' have results.|Maximilian Veers|Doctor Aphra (2016) 37}}\n'''Maximilian Veers''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who served as a [[general]] in the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Imperial Army|army]]. In that capacity, he fought in the [[Galactic Civil War]], which pitted the Galactic Empire against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. Veers was famous for his leadership during the Imperial [[Battle of Hoth|assault]] on the then Rebellion-occupied in the [[Hoth]] system, during which he led a squadron of [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] past Rebel defenses and personally destroyed the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] powering [[Echo Base|Rebel base's]] [[deflector shield]]. His leadership in the battle was critical to the successful takeover of the Hoth planetary system, a key victory for the Galactic Empire. Veers himself was critically injured during the battle when a [[Rogue Squadron]] [[snowspeeder]] crashed into his AT-AT's cockpit, destroying the walker, but ultimately survived.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early service===\n{{Quote|General Veers, prepare your men.|Darth Vader, preparing Veers for the Battle of Hoth|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\n[[File:Veers_and_Kosh.png|thumb|left|200px|General Veers worked with Officer Kosh following the Battle of Yavin.]]\nA [[human]] [[Gender|male]], Maximilian Veers was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] of [[Denon]]. In [[time]], he came to serve as an [[Imperial Army|army]] [[officer]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], an authoritarian [[Politics|regime]] that governed most of [[the galaxy]].<ref name=\"USW\" /> As such, he was involved in the Empire's [[Galactic Civil War|struggle]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], which contested the [[Imperial Era|rule]] of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]].<ref name=\"ESB\" /> Rising in the ranks through cunning and courage, Veers took part in over a dozen battles, including conflicts against the [[Zalorian]]s [[Zaloriis campaign|on]] [[Zaloriis]] and the [[Culroonian]]s [[Culroon III campaign|on]] [[Culroon III]].<ref name=\"wannabe\">''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]''</ref> Aside from being a brilliant [[army]] [[Imperial officer|officer]], Veers was also a [[Marriage|husband]] and a [[Parent|father]].<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref>\n\nVeers was eventually assigned to the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]], but was ultimately not on board during the [[Battle of Yavin]], where it was destroyed by the Rebel Alliance. The destruction of the Death Star also helped accelerate his career due to the large amount of Imperial officers [[Death|killed]] during the battle.<ref name=\"Force Collection\">{{ForceCollection|General Veers|star=3}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Battle of Yavin, Veers already served as a [[general]]. At that time, he was tasked with [[hunting]] down a [[governor]] who betrayed the Empire and locating the former [[senator]] [[Johhar Kessen]]. The Empire believed that Kessen would play a key role in finding the location of the Rebel Alliance's new headquarters, and for the duration of that mission, Veers was assisted by [[Captain]] [[Kosh]], an officer stationed on [[Tatooine]] and in command of the [[68th Legion]].<ref name=\"SWC\">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref>\n\n===Weeds in a storm===\n{{Quote|You're mistaken. They're not vermin. They're weeds. Alas, we are the storm. When the storm blows, weeds bend. When the storm passes, they're unharmed. If the Rebellion were a tree, it'd be different... Until then, they will continue to slip through our fingers|General Veers' assessment of the Rebellion, given to Ozzel and Vader|Shu-Torun Lives}}\nSometime later, Veers along with [[Admiral]] [[Kendal Ozzel]], travel to the planet [[Mustafar]] to meet with [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the Emperor's dark enforcer, at [[Fortress Vader|his castle]]. Veers stood along side Ozzel behind Vader as the [[Sith Lord]] looked out over the Mustafar landscape. After the admiral stated that the rebels were vermin and asked Vader on how they would eliminate them, Veers spoke up and informed Ozzel that he was mistaken. He stated that the rebels were not vermin but weeds and that the Empire was like a storm.<ref name=\"Shu-Torun Lives\">{{Shortstory|story=Shu-Torun Lives|book=Star Wars 50|bformatted=''Star Wars'' 50}}</ref>\n\nVeers went on to explain that in a storm, weeds are able to bend and survive just as the Rebellion was capable of doing despite the Empire's constant attacks. The general went on to say that if the Rebels were more like a tree, sturdy and rooted in one place, then it would be different. Veers went on to comment that until the situation changed, the Rebels would continue to slip through their fingers. His comment caused Vader to then recall the same statement Princess Leia made to Grand Moff Tarkin. Vader stated that Veers made an interesting point and went on to explain their next course of action against the Rebels.<ref name=\"Shu-Torun Lives\" />\n\n===Searching for the Rebel base===\n{{Quote|General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.|Darth Vader, preparing Veers for the Battle of Hoth|audio=PrepareYourTroopsForASurfaceAttack.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\n[[File:Veers-hd.png|thumb|220x220px|Veers speaks with Darth Vader.]]\nShortly thereafter, Darth Vader launched [[Project Swarm]], under which thousands of [[Viper probe droid]]s were dispatched across the galaxy in an effort to discover the location of the new Rebel base. Incensed by the lack of quick progress, Vader ended up executing the project's supervisor, [[Major]] [[Yaltza]]. As a result, General Veers was put in charge of the operation and transferred to the ''[[Executor]]'', the [[flagship]] of Vader's own [[flotilla]], [[Death Squadron]]. When [[Professor]] [[Rupo Ud|Ud]] pointed out that the Rebels had used at least one ancient site in the past, Veers assembled a team of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] consultants that notably included the rogue scholar [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Chelli Aphra]]. The first lead they investigated was a [[deathshrine]] of the [[Central Isopter]] buried in the [[Kartovian Formation]], on [[Ash Moon 1]]. Veers himself took part in the ensuing expedition. Although the ground crew did not find anything resembling a military base there, Professor Ud was killed after activating a structural trigger, and Aphra's [[Parent|father]] [[Korin Aphra|Korin]] was found lurking on the premises and arrested.<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra 37\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 37|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 37]]</ref>\n\nAboard the ''Executor'', Veers often clashed ideologically with Ozzel, his superior. While Ozzel preferred a measured, calculated approach to [[Imperial Military|military]] strategy, Veers was more doggedly loyal to the personal whims of Vader, making him a favored figure among the Imperial hierarchy.{{Fact}}\n\nEventually, one of the Viper [[droid]]s detected signs of an [[Echo Base|occupied settlement]] on the sixth planet of [[Hoth]], a [[Hoth system|system]] located in the [[Anoat sector]] of the galactic [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. On the ''Executor'', Veers joined the panel of officers who reviewed the droid's data, along with Vader, Ozzel and his subordinate, Captain [[Firmus Piett]]. While Vader immediately identified the data as proof of the Rebellion, Ozzel was more skeptical. Vader ultimately ordered the fleet to investigate the Hoth [[Star system|system]], and Veers began to prepare for the assault.<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\n===Imperial hero of Hoth===\n{{Quote|Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments.

As a result, [[Alliance Military|Rebel forces]] on the planet's surface had time to prepare a defense plan and organize an evacuation. Due to a localized energy shield protecting the base and [[power generator]], [[orbital bombardment]] of the base was considered to be an ineffective attack strategy. After informing Vader of such information, Veers was ordered to lead a [[Battle of Hoth|ground assault]] on the power generator and disable the energy shield. Vader then executed Ozzel and promoted Piett to Admiral.<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\nVeers, who had always kept a low profile in front of Vader,<ref name=\"SWE\" /> had been offered a chance to correct Ozzel's mistake. His [[Blizzard Force|squadron]] of Imperial [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] were deployed beyond the border of the energy shield, allowing a ground approach to be made. Veers led the squadron into the Echo Base [[mountain]] valley, facing heavy Rebel ground fire as he approached the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]]. The general led his [[troop]]s from the front, in the [[cockpit]] of the [[Blizzard 1|lead]] [[walker]], as the Rebels prepared to evacuate their headquarters. A group of [[T-47 airspeeder|snowspeeders]] led by Rebel [[Commander]] [[Luke Skywalker]] tried to delay Veers' force, destroying two walkers. As [[Alliance Army|Rebel ground forces]] retreated, Veers ordered his walker to fire on the shield generator, destroying it. The generator's destruction marked the end of the Rebel defense, allowing Vader and [[501st Legion|his men]] to land on Hoth and break into the base, and demonstrating Veers' effectiveness as a military commander.<ref name=\"ESB\" /> During the battle, Blizzard 1 was decapitated when a snowspeeder flown by [[Derek Klivian]] crashed into it.<ref name=\"OFL\">''[[Star Wars: On the Front Lines]]''</ref> The action injured Veers to the point of nearing death, but his unyielding devotion to carrying out Vader's will allowed him to stay conscious and ultimately survive long enough for Imperial medics to assist him.<ref name=\"FACPOV\">{{Shortstory|story=The Truest Duty|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> Veers later infiltrated Echo Base with his [[Cold weather assault stormtrooper|snowtrooper]]s.<ref name=\"USW\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Target.
