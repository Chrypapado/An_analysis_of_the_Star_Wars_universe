That's my life and I don't apologize for that.|The Meatlump King|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nThe '''Meatlump King''' was the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[King/Legends|ruler]] of the [[Meatlumps]], a [[Gangster/Legends|gang]] labeled by the [[Corellian Security Force]] [[Law enforcement agency|authorities]] as \"fanatical\" and \"somewhat stupid\" progress haters. The [[Gender/Legends|man]] who would later become the King of the Meatlumps started his career as a [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] building weapons for the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. However, he soon began to despise building these deadly implements, and adopted the view that most electronics and advanced technology were the source of evil in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. The king-to-be deserted the Empire and rescued three young men from their abusive [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] father, [[Lucien Bender]], and took them as his own. After Imperial [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] attempted to [[Death/Legends|kill]] him, the three brothers, [[Draykken Bender|Draykken]], [[Hraykken Bender|Hraykken]], and [[Louis Bender]], formed the Meatlump Gang in earnest, naming it after their favorite [[Meatlump (food)|namesake]] [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]]. Since that [[Time/Legends|time]], the Meatlump King assumed his titular role, and held court in the abandoned maintenance tunnels beneath [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia's]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]]. From their [[Meatlump Hideout|hideout]], the King served as the figurehead of the [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorist]] organization, while his three \"sons\" handled its [[Standard day|day]]-to-day operations. By the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], the gang numbered in the thousands, and began founding chapters on various other [[Planet|worlds]] throughout the galaxy, both to promote its message, and to destroy the technology they so desperately despised.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Empire forsaken===\n[[File:MeatlumpCardboardening.jpg|120px|thumb|The Meatlump King surrounded himself with cardboard cutouts such as these.]]\n{{Quote|You ran experiments on your sons?''\"<br />\"''No!

However, he soon grew to regret building these deadly implements, and eventually adopted the [[Philosopher/Legends|philosophy]] that most electronics and advanced technology were the source of evil in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Distraught by the work he was doing, the once loyal Imperial scientist deserted the Empire and set his [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] on three young men, the sons of an abusive [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] known as [[Lucien Bender]].<ref name=\"CorSec\" /><ref name=\"AED\" /> Lucien had used his sons as test subjects for a number of experiments, prompting the three of them to run away. The man who would become the Meatlump King took the three brothers, [[Draykken Bender|Draykken]], [[Hraykken Bender|Hraykken]], and [[Louis Bender]], as his own. Lucien was deeply upset that his sons had abandoned him to be with the ex-Imperial scientist and held a grudge ever since.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===From the outlaw is born the Meatlump King===\n{{Quote|How did you become King of the Meatlumps?''\"<br />\"''I was the first.

For I am the tallest and the most glorious.|A spacer and the Meatlump King|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nSince abandoning his post and taking the three Bender brothers as his own sons, the ex-scientist found himself in the crosshairs of the Galactic Empire. Imperial [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] attempted to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the technology-hating Human, but ultimately failed to do so. After the attempt on his life, the Bender brothers decided to form their [[Gangster/Legends|gang]] in earnest&mdash;the Meatlumps.<ref name=\"CorSec\" /> With the gang's founding, the \"father\" to the three Bender brothers assumed his titular role of Meatlump King. He felt this was just, for he believed himself to be the \"tallest\" and the \"most glorious\" one suited for the role. However, it was in fact Draykken Bender who decided to name their gang after their delicious, yet unappetizing [[Meatlump (food)|namesake]]. The [[Foodstuff/Legends|snack]] was a favorite of not only the three brothers, but the Meatlump King himself. At one point, the Meatlump King dropped a meatlump into a river. When he tried to grab it, he fell in. He feared he would drown, but the river carried him to shore. Ever since his near-death encounter, the King resolved to always eat his snacks away from [[Water/Legends|water]]. From their base of operations on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], the Meatlump King also resolved to never again be a puppet for either the Empire or the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], but to be the master of his own destiny.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Meatlump menace===\n{{Quote|Our king says that electronics are the source of evil in the world and must be purged.

Whatever.|Lieutenant Ubbal Fenn and a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n[[File:MeatlumpKingDoll.jpg|130px|thumb|The Meatlump King was alleged to have collected thousands of these dolls.]]\nBy the [[Time/Legends|time]] following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], the number of Meatlumps had swelled to the thousands. To accommodate their growing numbers, the gang established their headquarters in the abandoned [[Coronet Maintenance Tunnels|maintenance tunnels]] and sewers beneath Corellia's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]]. They also conducted operations out of a [[Meatlump Cave|cave]] near the city of [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]], and in numerous camps surrounding Coronet City.<ref name=\"AED\" /> Although the Bender brothers were widely regarded as \"dullards\" in their own right,<ref name=\"CorSec\" /> they were actually the ones responsible for handling the [[Standard day|day]]-to-day operations of their up-and-coming [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorist]] organization. Meanwhile, their enigmatic King remained more a figurehead, taking little interest in guiding the destructive tendencies of his followers. From their [[Meatlump Hideout|hideout]] beneath the streets of Coronet City, the Meatlump King held court with his many followers, surrounding himself with [[Paper/Legends|cardboard]] stand-ups and [[Painting of the Meatlump King|paintings of himself]]. His court was a nonstop, though reportedly half-hearted, attempt at self glorification. [[Chef/Legends|Chefs]] [[Schlump]] and [[Schlap]] would regularly make him [[Meatlump wine]], and the Meatlump [[Doctor/Legends|surgeon]] [[Newin Seedel]] would knit [[Meatlump King doll|dolls]] of the King, of which Seedel speculated he already had thousands. Nevertheless, the Meatlumps as a whole carried on the King's vision of a galaxy without technology. Recruiter [[Joe]] disseminated countless [[Book/Legends|books]] titled the ''[[Meatlump Manifesto]]'' in order to attract new recruits. The gang also terrorized citizens by planting improvised bombs near machinery. In the absence of explosives, gang members used their own [[Limb/Legends|hands]] to damage or destroy large amounts of private and public property, including [[Speeder/Legends|speeders]], [[Droid/Legends|droids]], [[Power generator/Legends|power generators]], [[Computer/Legends|technical consoles]], and communications systems. The Meatlumps had even once attacked a man known as [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Osto Grissom]] because he transported electronics into and out of the [[Corellian system]].<ref name=\"AED\" /> This wanton destruction attracted the attention of the [[Corellian Security Force]] [[Law enforcement agency|authorities]], who regarded the Meatlumps as \"fanatical\" and \"somewhat stupid\" progress haters.<ref name=\"CorSec\" /> And Lucien, still angered by the loss of his biological sons, had by now formed the [[Bofa Treat Gang]] to oppose the growing Meatlumps.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Figure of worship===\n[[File:LumpLump.jpg|120px|thumb|The Meatlump Lump featuring the King's profile visage]]\n{{Quote|I'm beginning to wonder if the Meatlump King has avoided being found simply due to the buffoonery of his followers. I found a report of another Meatlump smashing a generator here in Coronet, but I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth pursuing.|Vani Korr|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAs the Meatlumps expanded their operations to include chapters on other worlds, including [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]], [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], [[Lok/Legends|Lok]], [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], [[Rori/Legends|Rori]], [[Talus/Legends|Talus]], and [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], the King remained nestled within his court chamber of the Meatlump Hideout. By now, the gang had even adopted their own [[Currency/Legends|currency]] known as the [[Meatlump Lump]]. The Meatlump Lump, or Lump, was little more than a small [[Mineral/Legends|rock]] featuring the profile image of the Meatlump King, the symbol of the [[Galactic Credit Standard]], and [[Aurebesh/Legends|Aurebesh]] [[Writing system|text]] reading, \"In Meatlump We Trust.\" In fact, the Meatlump King would on occasion mint Lumps of his own, by painting the appropriate symbols on an unmarked lump of rock. So pervasive was the cult of the Meatlump King, that aside from these Meatlump Lumps, [[Painting/Legends|portraits]], dolls, and cardboard cutouts of himself, he could also be seen [[Entertainer|dancing]] as a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] on many [[holo-entertainment table]]s. Despite all this, the existence of a Meatlump King was unknown to most the galaxy.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nThat all changed when [[Vani Korr]], a Human [[Journalist/Legends|journalist]] of the ''[[Corellia Times]]'', sought to learn more about the Meatlumps and their leadership. However, in the process of doing so, she was attacked by several Meatlump [[Stooge]]s who overturned her speeder while she was driving. She was thrown clear and knocked unconscious. However, she was rescued when two CorSec [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] approached the Stooges, prompting them to scatter. Vani later woke up in the [[Coronet Hospital]], with her speeder destroyed, and her [[Viewscreen/Legends|viewscreen]] missing.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Search for the lump nub===\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nLater, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] got into a deadly altercation with Stooges who were vandalizing power generators in Coronet. This prompted [[Sublieutenant/Legends|Sublieutenant]] [[Merkie Howzat]] to get involved, only to be killed by the spacer. On him was the viewscreen featuring the ''Corellia Times'' news logo. Realizing it belonged to an employee, the spacer eventually returned the viewscreen to its rightful owner, Vani Korr.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nVani was pleased that the viewscreen had been returned, but she was not yet ready to give up her investigations of the Meatlump Gang. Understanding that the criminal organization would now recognize her, she commissioned the help of the spacer to act as her [[field agent]]. After an extensive investigation resulting in a number of dead ends, the spacer finally managed learn more about the gang, while gaining the good graces of a Meatlump [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] by the name of [[Kaiya Merel]]. After gaining Kaiya's trust, the spacer was initiated into the organization in order to replace gang member [[Alliin Mepou]], who was retiring. It was just the lucky break Vani needed. With her [[Agent/Legends|agent]] successfully infiltrating the Meatlumps as a [[Spy/Legends|spy]], she could finally determine once and for all if the Meatlump King was truly real, or merely a myth.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Kingly revelations===\n{{Quote|So am I a Meatlump?''\"<br />\"''Ya are.

I shouldn't give away all our secrets to some new Meatie.|A spacer and Lieutenant Kaiya Merel|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter Kaiya Merel inducted Vani Korr's field agent into the Meatlumps, the spacer was granted full access to their secret hideout. Merel insinuated that the newly inducted \"Meatie\" might even have a chance to meet the Meatlump King himself. This was a prospect which excited Vani, as she was eager to complete the second part of her ''Corellia Times'' newspaper article, \"[[Who are the Meatlumps?]]\" When Vani's undercover agent entered the hideout, she got the confirmation she needed. The Meatlump King was real. Within his [[Throne/Legends|throne]] room, the spacer personally [[Language/Legends|spoke]] to the King, who welcomed the being to their organization. The spacer heard the King's philosophies of life, and witnessed the court of adulation he had built around himself. When the spacer returned to Vani to report the news, she completed work on her newspaper article. Finally, the people of the galaxy could learn what had only heretofore been rumors and speculation. The King was real. And not only was he real, the gang he had a hand in founding was thriving. This proved to be a shock to Vani Korr, for the spacer had only used the most rudimentary deceptions to infiltrate their [[Military rank/Legends|ranks]]. How the Meatlump King had managed to elude detection and persecution for so long, was nothing short of a mystery to the ''Corellia Times'' reporter.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n[[File:AssaultandBattery.jpg|200px|thumb|A frightened Meatlump King is apprehended at blasterpoint by a CorSec agent]]\nAt some point, a Human female Corellian Security Force agent entered the hideout and apprehended the Meatlump King at [[Blaster/Legends|blasterpoint]] using a [[DH-17 blaster pistol/Legends|DH-17 blaster pistol]].

But I've got my own peace of mind. I don't need yours and won't give you mine.|The Meatlump King|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nThe Meatlump King was a tall, bald, fair-skinned Human male. He had [[Color/Legends|gray]] eyes and black [[Hair/Legends|eyebrows]]. During his time as King of the Meatlumps, he painted the front of his face with white makeup, and his [[Mouth/Legends|lips]] with black makeup. He also wore black eyeliner.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n''Corellia Times'' reporter Vani Korr viewed the Meatlump King as an enigmatic, strikingly charismatic figure. Indeed, the King exhibited a strong vocabulary with moments of philosophical insight. This was in contrast to his followers, who were often simpleminded and easily fooled, and spoke a less sophisticated form of [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]]. The King pondered concepts such as peace of mind, love of life, and power. However, the King was also known to display megalomaniac tendencies. He believed himself suited for the role of King of the Meatlumps, simply for being the \"tallest\" and the \"most glorious.\" If one were to question his rule in place of a democracy, he would swiftly threaten to [[Prison|imprison]] that individual like a \"common droid.\" The Meatlump [[Technician/Legends|Ordnance Technician]] would break down in tears if threatened with a visit by the Meatlump King. However other Meatlumps, such as Lieutenant [[Ubbal Fenn]], were more flippant about the King. She shared his philosophy of a galaxy purged of technology, but paid little heed to his official title.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n[[File:MeatPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A portrait of the Meatlump King]]\nThe King was also quite vain, and promoted a court of self-glorification. He surrounded himself with self-portraits, and cardboard cutouts of himself pointing to his [[Crown/Legends|crown]]. Newin Seedel speculated that he must have kept thousands of knitted dolls of himself. Although he enjoyed his rule, the Meatlump King did not have ambitions for more power. He claimed he did not wish to rule the galaxy, and that he found peace in his own sanctuary beneath the streets of Coronet. He was content to simply rule the Meatlumps, which he viewed as his own \"Empire.\" He vowed to never again be a puppet, either for Palpatine's Galactic Empire, or the opposing Rebel Alliance. He was proud of his Meatlumps, who he believed would never break, lie down, or bend for anyone, other than himself. He thought little of the Corellian Security Force, the law-enforcement agency that was the gang's mortal enemy.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nAlthough the King did not take very kindly to those questioning his rule, he did display a somewhat generous demeanor. He took in the Bender brothers as his own sons, after they escaped from their abusive cyborg father, Lucien. He did not believe his \"Empire\" should be divided, and welcomed all Meatlumps to his hideout. However, the King was also elusive. Few outside the hideout knew that he existed as a real entity. ''Corellia Times'' reporter Vani Korr speculated that the Meatlumps' \"buffoonery\" had the unintended consequence of shielding the King from public persecution. However, certain Meatlumps, such as Lieutenant Merel, made an active if feeble attempt to hide the King's identity from new members.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|It's amazing how the colors of the real world only seem truly real when you see them in my coat.|The Meatlump King|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAs King, [[Clothing/Legends|he wore]] a grotesque, multicolored [[Robe/Legends|coat]] trimmed with feathery details.
