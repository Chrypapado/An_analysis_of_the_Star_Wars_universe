Because [[Ta'a Chume]] was threatened by her pacifistic tendencies, she had deemed her too weak to rule and had Elliar drowned in one of [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]]' reflecting pools.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSome sources refer to this character as '''Ellian'''.\n\nIn the novel ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'', there was a passage that stated that Ta'a Chume might have arranged the murder of her eldest son's fianc\u00e9e and even of the man himself. Since there was no use of names in this passage, it can imply that either [[Kalen (Hapan)|Kalen]] was Elliar's fianc\u00e9 (which is a continuity error) or that Kalen also had a fianc\u00e9e who was murdered by Ta'a Chume (which is possible, since next to nothing is known about him). This would also make sense, if like Elliar, she felt this woman too weak to be her successor as dictated by Hapan law.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Courtship of Princess Leia]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|Isolder entry}}\n*{{FFCite|99|ISO1-2, ''Prince Isolder''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040506hapesmain|text=Hapes: Ladies First|int=Hapes: Ladies First|archivedate=20100507041732}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galaxy of Intrigue]]''\n*{{DB|character|isolder|Isolder|archivedate=20100712110827}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Elliar\n|pl=Elliar\n|ru=\u042d\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0430\u0440\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hapans]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
