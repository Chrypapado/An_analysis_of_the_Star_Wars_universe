You are here for your trial, yes? Learn the ways of the Sith from a doddering old man in a tomb? And hopefully to return to your master with the mark of my approval.|Spindrall meets a new student|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Spindrall''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Master]] adherent of the [[Sith Order (Sith Empire)|Sith Order]] during the [[Great Galactic War]]. By the time of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Spindrall was an elder [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Prophet/Legends|prophet]] and [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lord]] who had made his home on the Sith's holy [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Korriban]]. In the deepest reaches of the [[Tomb of Ajunta Pall|tomb]] of the ancient Sith [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Ajunta Pall]], Spindrall counseled new [[Sith Acolyte|acolytes]] on the [[Code of the Sith/Legends|Code of the Sith]] and [[Sith training|retrained]] failed students who hoped to earn re-entry into the prestigious [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]] of Korriban.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Lord [[Darth Zash|Zash]], a supervisor at the academy who visited Spindrall during her own training, mandated that all of her prospective [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentices]] seek out the hermit during their early trials so that he might judge their worth. Around [[3643 BBY]], Zash's new class of students traveled into the tomb to find Spindrall in the Sacrificial Chamber. Although all seven of them successfully traversed the dangers of the tomb, only one student, a [[Darth Nox|slave-turned-promising acolyte]], truly impressed Spindrall. The elder Sith allowed all seven of Zash's Sith hopefuls to leave the tomb, but chose to condemn the timid acolyte [[Kory]]&mdash;a condemnation that resulted in her [[Death/Legends|execution]] upon her return to the Academy.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Now, slave, for your trial: There's a hermit named Spindrall who lives in the tomb of Ajunta Pall in the Valley of the Dark Lords.

Spindrall speaks with a notable English accent.}}</ref> Spindrall was inducted into the [[Sith Order (Sith Empire)|Sith Order]] and eventually attained the rank of [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]]. Although he was renowned for his insight into the minds of young [[Sith Acolyte]]s and his command of the [[Code of the Sith/Legends|Code of the Sith]], Spindrall chose to forgo the traditional path of a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] and instead adopted the life of a hermit. In the [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|Valley of the Dark Lords]] on the ancestral Sith [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Korriban]], he took up residence in the [[Tomb of Ajunta Pall|tomb]] of the ancient [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Lord of the Sith]] [[Ajunta Pall]], and there he counseled aspiring [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentices]] and took failed acolytes under his [[Sith training|tutelage]].<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" />\n\nSpindrall grew old in the tomb, and although he had little contact with the surface or nearby [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]], the teachers at the school knew of his expertise and began sending their students to meet with the elder Sith Lord. Within the tomb's Sacrificial Chamber, Spindrall held audience with the few young Sith who survived the crypt's dangers. He also accepted disgraced acolytes who had failed in the academy's trials and were seeking tutelage so that they might earn a second chance at becoming Sith. Spindrall's seekers included the Humans [[Darth Zash|Zash]] and [[Harkun]], both of whom would continue their training and ultimately achieve supervisory positions at the Sith Academy.<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" />\n\n[[File:Spindrall_chamber.png|thumb|left|230px|Spindrall's chamber in the tombs]]\nWhen she herself rose to the rank of Sith Lord, Zash chose to send her own students into the Tomb of Ajunta Pall so that they might be judged by Spindrall.<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" /> Around [[3643 BBY]],<ref name=\"GameDate\">Act I of ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' takes place around [[3643 BBY]] per the reasoning [[Template:TOR dates|here]].</ref> she ordered that Harkun, now an Academy [[Overseer (Sith)|Overseer]], direct a new class of seven acolytes into the tombs so that they might be tested and appraised by the hermit. Four of the acolytes&mdash;[[Balek]], [[Wydr]], [[Niloc]], and [[Gerr]]&mdash;completed the task and returned to the Academy without either impressing or disappointing Spindrall. Another student, the timid and kindly [[Kory]], succeeded in reaching Spindrall, but failed his challenges and was therefore deemed unworthy of the title of Sith. A [[Darth Nox|sixth student]] also reached the elder Sith in the Sacrificial Chamber, but Spindrall refused to appraise them until they completed a trial of [[Blood/Legends|blood]]. The trial also served as the final test for the disgraced students who had been studying with the [[Prophet/Legends|prophet]] in the hopes of having an opportunity to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the new acolyte and take their position at the Academy. Zash's sixth acolyte handily defeated Spindrall's disciples, thereby earning his attention and judgment. Spindrall recited to the young Sith the tenets of the Code of the Sith and encouraged the student to nurse their hatred for Harkun and their distrust of Zash.<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" />\n\nAfter the sixth acolyte left his domain, Spindrall sent his judgments to Harkun. The Overseer took the hermit's words into account and allowed all of the acolytes to continue their studies except for Kory, who Harkun executed. Spindrall was visited a short time later by Zash's seventh acolyte, [[Ffon Althe]], who also passed his tests.<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" /> After the trials of Zash's pupils, more disgraced students and aspiring apprentices sought Spindrall's counsel. The hermit found at least one of these acolytes, [[Shinos]], to be lacking Sith resolve, and so refused to allow them free passage out of the tombs unless they passed a message of congratulations and a [[Stimulant/Legends|stimulant]] on to Zash's sixth acolyte, who had impressed him the most.<ref name=\"The Gift of Spindrall\">{{TORcite|type=message|The Gift of Spindrall|Acolyte Shinos}}</ref> Later in the [[Galactic War]] between the Republic and the Empire, when the Force-user known as [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] was returning to power, Spindrall could sense that Revan's return threw the Force into turmoil, and when he reached out to study it, he received a vision of someone standing on a moon before \"one who is not one.\" The subject of his vision did not stand alone, but failed nonetheless.<ref name=\"A vision\">{{TORcite|type=message|A vision|Spindral}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Do not be timid. Humility is the attitude of a slave, not a Sith.|Spindrall|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nBy the time of the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], Spindrall was an elderly man, sporting a [[Color/Legends|gray]] beard and a receding [[Hair/Legends|hairline]]. He garbed himself in simple, tattered [[Sith apparel|robes]] and covered his head with a raised cowl. His fair visage was characterized by yellow [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], a slight darkened discoloration around his eye sockets, and extensive wrinkling.<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" />\n\nAlthough he was a talented [[Seer (profession)|seer]] with a keen intuition, Spindrall lacked many of the attributes that characterized his fellow Sith of the era. On the [[Battle of Korriban|reclaimed]] holy [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of Korriban, the Sith Lord abandoned the trappings of [[Politics/Legends|political]] power and adopted the life of a religious hermit. In his hermitage in the Sacrificial Chamber of the Tomb of Ajunta Pall, the prophet accepted failed students and counseled new arrivals to the planet&mdash;two groups that many at the Academy believed were unworthy of notice. His work in the tomb led some, like Overseer Harkun, to believe he was little more than a lunatic; others, like Lord Zash, put faith in his judgments and subscribed to his teachings.<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" />\n\nIn spite of his willingness to work with young acolytes, Spindrall was a harsh [[Sith Master/Legends|Master]] who was quick to pass judgment on his pupils. Those who failed to meet his standards, like Kory and Shinos, were dealt with severely, while others, like the acolyte who slew Spindrall's disgraced pupils, were rewarded for their talent and tenacity. For those who he believed to be worthy of his teachings, he offered insights on the Code of the Sith and methods for surviving the tutelage of brutal or untrustworthy Masters.<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|He said I could only leave his sight alive if I passed along this, his 'final gift for the one who will shape fates both future and ancient.'

His judgments on students were considered to be prophetic in nature, and were highly valued by Sith Masters who believed Spindrall's [[Force vision/Legends|Force visions]].<ref name=\"Of Mind and Matter\" /> Zash's apprentice, the seeker who slew Spindrall's disciples, even reached the [[Dark Council]] after fulfilling the seer's prophecy that they would shape the fates of individuals from both the future and [[Force ghost|past]].<ref name=\"The Dark Council\">{{TORcite|type=class|Sith Inquisitor|The Dark Council|Dromund Kaas}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSpindrall is a non-player character included in the massively-multiplayer [[video game]], ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', released in [[2011]].
