We'd like to ask you a few questions.|Alana Walden|Agents of Deception}}\n'''Alana Walden''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Officer/Legends|officer]] of the [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|security]] division during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|A colleague of mine in Tyrena has some open case files that I thought you might be able to help her with. Head over to Tyrena and speak with Major Alana Walden.|[[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mack Jasper|Jasper]]|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Alana Walden held the rank of [[Major/Legends|major]] in the [[Corellian Security Force]] and was stationed in [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]].<ref name=\"SWG:SwMW\" /> She was also part of the CorSec [[Tactical Response Team]].<ref name=\"AW\" /><ref name=\"TRT\" />\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Major Walden investigated the surge in the number of missing persons on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. Via [[Corellia News Service]], she announced [[Bandor Mokk]] and [[Faye Patrick]] as dangerous suspects, and encouraged citizens to contact CorSec if they had any information.<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?id=66901&resource=features|text=Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives|archivedate=20111124014132}}</ref> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> a spacer finally discovered that all those missing persons were captured and [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] by [[Corellian slavers]]. The spacer managed to infiltrate the [[Corellian Slaver Bunker]] and sliced the bunker's main computer. The spacer broadcasted the slavers' records on the CorSec emergency request channels,<ref name=\"SWG:IE\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Incriminating Evidence|Corellia}}</ref> leading dozens of CorSec agents to quickly move to the slaver bunker and free all the slaves.<ref name=\"SWG:HbtKS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Head back to Kyran Silene|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TacticalResponseTeam-TotC.jpg|thumb|left|Alana Walden in action.]]\nLater the same year, she received news that the kidnapping case had been solved. [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mack Jasper|Jasper]] sent her the independent agent who had helped solve the case to help Walden with her backlog of recent cases.<ref name=\"SWG:SwMW\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Speak with Major Walden|Corellia}}</ref> The first case she gave the adventurer was the alleged theft of a [[Corellian Medal of Honor]] from retired CorSec officer [[Wilfred Quelsh]]. The agent found out that Quelsh had taken money from [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] to ignore their activities and framed a fellow officer, [[Kal Braggan]], for the crime. When Braggan confronted Quelsh, Quelsh killed him. Walden was very grateful that the case had been solved and promised that Quelsh would have to pay for his crime.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"CorSec Case Files: Stolen Honor\" on Corellia</ref> The next case she gave the independent agent was an attack on the starship captain [[Osto Grissom]] by members of the [[Meatlumps|Meatlump gang]]. The adventurer tracked the Meatlumps to [[Meatlump Cave|a cave]] near Tyrena and found out that Grissom had been attacked because he transported electronics.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFAaB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|CorSec Case Files: Assault and Battery|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nThen Walden received a message from her colleague, Lieutenant [[Lon Cope]], that needed the independent agent's help in a murder investigation.

They tracked him down and confronted him in a dead-end alley in the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. What the CorSec agents did not know, however, was that the smuggler was in fact an agent of [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]], operating undercover. The ISB agent could not afford to break his cover, so he engaged in a firefight with Walden and her men. Having set his blaster for stun, he put up the fierce defense and knocked all operatives, including Walden, unconscious. After taking Walden's datapad with information about her next contact, the ISB had left her bleeding in the alley.<ref>{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlana Walden appeared as a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online-role playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:SwMW\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011.<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|scenario=''The Skulls'' promotional scenario}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?id=66901&resource=features|text=Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives|archivedate=20111124014132}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Alana_Walden_(Avatar)_(card).JPG|cardname=Alana Walden}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Alana_Walden_(card).JPG|cardname=Alana Walden (#2)}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Stolen_Honor_(card).JPG|cardname=Stolen Honor}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Tactical_Response_Team_(card).JPG|cardname=Tactical Response Team}} {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Speak with Major Walden}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walden, Alana}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
