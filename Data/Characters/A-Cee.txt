He was chrome plated, had one of his [[Photoreceptor/Legends|photoreceptors]] replaced with a zoom lens, was equipped to record a thousand hours of audio and video, but could only speak \"dozens\" of languages. A cable from his lower-right side compartment allowed him to connect with a computer input panel and reproduce his recordings.\n\nBecause of the confidential information he was carrying, he was programmed to explode if capture or interference by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] seemed imminent.\n\n==Biography==\nA-Cee was the companion of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Candice Ondi]] in her capacity as information officer for the Alliance. Expecting [[Battle of the G-Tap|an Imperial assault]] at the [[G-Tap]] of [[Sulon]], he was with her, looking for pickup shots. The knowledge of his recording capacity made others, like [[Morgan Katarn]], nervous in his presence.<ref>''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the fight, the Rebels continuously were falling back and Morgan ordered Candice and other survivors to seek safety in the caves, but not before asking from her the services of the droid. Morgan found some time to upload the recording from his [[Electrobinoculars/Legends|electrobinoculars]] documenting the assault against the [[Danga estate]] and [[Katarn estate|his]], and narrate the events leading up to the Imperial assault. He then ordered the droid to find its way to the [[spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] and the Alliance leaders, and he covered its retreat.<ref>''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama]]''</ref> A-Cee witnessed the death of Candice as she was reporting, and he ran to her; she died cradled at the droid's arms.\n\nAfter the Imperial assault, A-Cee reached [[Barons Hed]] on a truck vehicle, hidden under some tarp; after passing through a checkpoint manned by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]], and then he recorded the severed heads of the Rebels captured earlier.  \n===With Jan Ors===\nA-Cee left Sulon and came in to the possession of Rebel Agent [[Jan Ors]] who eventually had an errand on board the ''[[Star of Empire]]''. When [[Kyle Katarn]] first visited [[Jan Ors]]' room onboard the ''[[Star of Empire]]''&mdash;clad in an [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer's]] uniform&mdash;A-Cee's photoreceptors picked up the [[Human/Legends|Human]] and his uniform perceived a class three threat and initiated his self-destruct sequence. With seconds remaining before the droid exploded, Ors overrode the subroutine&mdash;\"Override code alpha, bravo, zeta, one-niner-six.\" Ors realised that Officer Katarn was the son of recently deceased [[Morgan Katarn]], who was secretly a local Rebel leader, and used A-Cee's footage to prove to him the Empire's atrocities. \n\nA-Cee connected his torso cable to the room's input panel, and displayed the holo of Ondi's report; Kyle was convinced that his father was a Rebel fighting Imperial forces, who staged a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] \"terrorist\" assault. Kyle then demanded to see what happened to his father; Ors reluctantly gave permission to A-Cee to display the images of the beheaded Rebels, along with Morgan's head, that convinced Kyle about how the Empire actually operated. Seeing Kyle's pain, Ors ordered A-Cee to stop.\n\n[[File:A-Cee_2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A-Cee prior to self-destructing]]\nHowever their presence and operations became known to the [[bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Slyder]], and the Imperial [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Dol Donar II|Dol Donar]], who sent a force to arrest them. The next [[Standard day/Legends|day]] Ors received a warning from Katarn, and took A-Cee with her heading to the [[hangar|Legends|hangar]] deck. As they exited the hatch, A-Cee checked his apertures and switched to record, when Slyder with Imperial soldiers attempted to stop them. A-Cee however was always at job and paused to record their pursuers. The [[standard second/Legends|seconds]] he needed to rip off a scene he took before running away, was enough for Slyder to aim. A-Cee was hit on the back, hitting a subprocessor, forcing him to an emergency shutdown. \n\nUpon reactivation aboard Donar's [[Dol Donar's yacht|yacht]], A-Cee perceived [[Nathan Donar III|his son]] in an Imperial uniform and once more initiated the self-destruct sequence. All aboard died, either shot by Slyder in the bounty hunter's desperation, or killed in the explosion of four point two kilos of [[plitex nine]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the audio adaptation of [[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama|''Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire'']], A-Cee is voiced by [[Tim Russell]].\n\nA-Cee's role in the [[Battle of the G-tap]] is a bit different between the novel and the drama. In the novel he stays with Candice until her death, and then somehow hides in a truck and reaches the spaceport; in the drama Morgan Katarn, in the midst of the battle, asks from Candice to borrow him while she retreats, he then narrates the prelude of the Battle. He then orders the droid to leave, and covers his retreat to the spaceport.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|140|KAT5, ''Kyle Katarn''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=A-Cee\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic droids]]\n[[Category:Protocol droids]]\n[[Category:Sulonese]]"}}}]}}}}
