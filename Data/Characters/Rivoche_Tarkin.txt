That fact is Rivoche's main value to the Alliance.|General Airen Cracken|Cracken's Rebel Operatives}}\n'''Rivoche Tarkin''' was the daughter of [[Brigadier]] [[Gideon Tarkin]] and the niece of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]]. After her father's [[Death/Legends|death]], she lived with her uncle, during which [[Time/Legends|time]] she came to question the [[Tarkin family/Legends|Tarkin family's]] adherence to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. She passed privileged information regarding an Imperial attack to [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]], a young Imperial [[Cadet/Legends|cadet]] who had become a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]]. This information saved a number of [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] insurgents, and led to her becoming a deep-cover [[Agent/Legends|agent]] for [[Alliance Intelligence]]. She was quite successful in this role, as her connections, wealth, and status led her to be in demand for important social events and to be courted by a number of high-ranking Imperials.\n\nThe Empire uncovered evidence of her duplicity, prompting Rebel [[General/Legends|General]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]] to send two [[operative]]s, [[Cryle Cavv]] and [[Quillin Arkell]], to extract her just prior to her sham [[Marriage/Legends|wedding]] to [[Vastin Caglio|the son]] of an Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]]. The extraction was successful, despite the efforts of [[Sollaine]], the head of the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]], who was personally responsible for capturing her alive. Tarkin became a [[Journalist/Legends|reporter]] for [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]]. She was present aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Liberator (Imperial I-class)|''Liberator'']] when it crash-landed on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], where she reported on the [[Second Battle of Coruscant|devastation]] the [[Imperial Civil War]] had caused on the former center of [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government.

The sapphire contained a [[Hologram/Legends|holo]] of the [[Tarkin family/Legends|Tarkin family]] crest deep within it, and this stone became Tarkin's favorite jewel.<ref name=\"CRO\" />\n\n===Deep-cover agent===\n{{Quote|Rivoche has been an incredible help to us.

Her wealth, connections, and fashion sense put her in constant demand at important social events. She was courted by more than a dozen high-ranking Imperials at a time. Only Na'al, [[General/Legends|General]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]], and a handful of Alliance Intelligence [[Agent/Legends|agents]] were aware of her new loyalties, for fear that if knowledge of her identity as the niece of a hated and feared Imperial became more widespread it would lead to problematic repercussions within the Rebellion.<ref name=\"CRO\" />\n\nThere were those in the Empire who believed that Tarkin had a responsibility to [[Marriage/Legends|wed]] and raise the next generation of Tarkins eager to serve the New Order.

The younger Caglio saw her as the ideal trophy bride to further his [[Politics/Legends|political]] career, while Rivoche Tarkin, who regarded the man as a spoiled brat, saw him as an opportunity to end the scrutiny those pressuring her to wed placed upon her.<ref name=\"Small Favors\">{{Journal|12|Small Favors}}</ref>\n\n===Extraction===\n{{Quote|I never thought this day would come&hellip;|Rivoche Tarkin|Small Favors}}\nIn [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]],<ref name=\"TERC\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> just prior to Rivoche Tarkin's engagement party to Caglio on [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]], the Empire uncovered evidence, in the form of highly-encrypted [[Datafile/Legends|datafiles]], of a deep-cover operative working within the Empire. [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] considered locating this operative to be of paramount importance, but his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] and primary enforcer, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], was unable to attend to it personally, as he had just been given the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] and the responsibility of locating the new Rebel base. Instead, Vader recommended [[Sollaine]], the new head of the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]] and a rival of his, for the unenviable task of capturing the operative alive. Alliance Intelligence also became aware that evidence had fallen into the hands of the Empire, so General Cracken assigned former-[[Alliance Special Operations|SpecOp]] [[Cryle Cavv]] and [[Velabri Lancer]] [[Quillin Arkell]] to extract Tarkin.<ref name=\"Small Favors\" />\n\nCavv and Arkell arrived at Corulag to discover over one hundred thousand Imperial [[Starship/Legends|starships]], all present for the engagement party. Cavv and Arkell, who were flying under forged datawork identifying their ship, the ''[[G Cat]]'', as belonging to an Imperial noble, were given an automated invitation to the party. The invitation allowed them to get to Tarkin relatively unhindered, but Sollaine and a [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of [[Storm commando]]s arrived before they were able to leave. Cavv hastily foisted a package of [[Thermite/Legends|thermite]] explosive on the Imperials, managing to kill the commandos, severely wound Sollaine, and give Tarkin and her rescuers a chance to escape. When they realized that returning to their ship was out of the question, they proceeded to the [[Royal Galaxy Hotel]], the tallest building in [[Curamelle/Legends|Curamelle]], so that Cavv's [[R2-series astromech droid|droid]] could fly their ship to them.<ref name=\"Small Favors\" />\n\nHowever, Sollaine had hired over fifty [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] from [[Coreguard Security Services]] and set up an ambush on the roof of the [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]], having guessed it as their destination. Tarkin and her rescuers learned of the ambush after Cavv's [[Droid/Legends|droid]], [[R2-RC]], tapped into the rooftop surveillance [[imager]]s. They holed up in a hotel room while waiting for the arrival of Cavv's backup, a bounty hunter and master of disguise named [[Finn Varatha]]. Varatha provided Tarkin with a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], and together, the group of four turned the tables on the ambushers, defeating them despite overwhelming odds and clearing the way for R2-RC to pick them up.<ref name=\"Small Favors\" />\n\nTarkin and the rescue team fled the planet. A full [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] of [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]] pursued them into the maze of ships, exchanging fire with the ''G Cat''. Sollaine returned to his [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]], the [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']], and attempted to capture the ship, but it managed to escape to [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] when Darth Vader unexpectedly arrived in-[[Star system/Legends|system]] aboard the ''Executor''.<ref name=\"Small Favors\" />\n\n===New Republic reporter===\n{{Quote|Don't you worry, my boy; if she isn't safe with General Calrissian and General Antilles aboard, where would she be safe?

She was first mentioned in the ''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'', published by [[West End Games]] for ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' in [[1993]], and was given a full write-up by Horne in ''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]'' in [[1994]]. She was mentioned in several other West End products, usually in relation to her communications with Voren Na'al, though she also played a major role in the short story \"[[Small Favors]].\" Since West End Games ceased production of ''Star Wars'' materials, she has gone largely unmentioned, being referenced only in ''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'', ''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]'', and ''[[Galaxy of Intrigue]]''.\n\n[[Star Wars Adventure Journal 12|''Star Wars Adventure Journal'' 12]] includes an adventure idea in which player characters replace Cavv and Arkell in rescuing Tarkin from Corulag. The idea mostly echoes the plot of \"Small Favors,\" though for independent characters without pre-existing ties to the Rebellion, it suggests General Cracken&mdash;in the guise of a \"mysterious party\"&mdash;hires the characters to kidnap Tarkin.\n\nThe image of Rivoche Tarkin used in ''Cracken's Rebel Operatives'', drawn by [[Mike Vilardi]], has been reused twice. It appears in \"Small Favors\" to again represent her. Later, it was colorized and had background elements removed to illustrate the character template of an \"Arrogant Noble\" player character in ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''. Although Rivoche Tarkin's hair is described as brown, the colorized version of the image shows it as white.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|3|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{Imo}}\n*{{Journal|12|Small Favors}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Dark Empire Sourcebook|story=A Rebel's Job is Never Done ...|stext=''A Rebel's Job is Never Done ...''}} {{Mo}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Dark Empire Sourcebook|story=Eyewitness to Apocalypse|stext=''Eyewitness to Apocalypse''}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' {{Po}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galaxy of Intrigue]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rivoche Tarkin\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarkin, Rivoche}}\n[[Category:Alliance Intelligence members]]\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:New Republic Intelligence personnel]]\n[[Category:Tarkin family]]"}}}]}}}}
