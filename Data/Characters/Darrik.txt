His early childhood was mainly spent herding his siblings and cousins around to their classes at the [[Brentaal Commerce Academy]] in preparation for a career in his family's shipping company. Groomed for such a profession, he seemed destined for a life of authority and wealth. However, Darrik had other ambitions for his future.\n\n===Imperial double-cross===\nDarrik began to feel distraught with his life. Desirous to see more of the galaxy, he left his parent's home on Brentaal to pursue his interest of exploration. He would later manage this when he met smuggler Platt Okeefe at some point.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Imperial Double-Cross]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Darrik\n}}\n\n[[Category:Brentaalans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
