You have betrayed my Emperor, sullied the Empire, killed my friends, and struck down she I have sworn on my life to protect! I will leave your bones for the beasts to crack.|Ganner Krieg to the Sith on Vendaxa|Legacy (2006) 7}}\n'''Ganner Krieg''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Master of the [[Imperial Knight]]s who served [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]]'s [[Empire-in-exile]] during the [[Second Imperial Civil War]]. Noted for his calm and serious demeanor, Krieg was a trusted friend of fellow Knight [[Antares Draco]] and was often paired with him on missions during the war. In [[137 ABY]], the two of them accompanied the Emperor as he [[Fall of Bastion|retook]] the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] from the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Krayt]]'s [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Imperial forces]], the [[fortress world]] having been wrested from Fel's control following the [[Battle of Caamas|conclusion]] of the [[Sith&ndash;Imperial War]] [[130 ABY|seven years prior]]. Krieg and Draco soon after disobeyed a direct order from Fel and traveled to [[Vendaxa/Legends|Vendaxa]], where the Emperor's daughter, the [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Marasiah Fel]], was being pursued by [[Agent/Legends|agents]] of the [[One Sith]]. After joining forces with two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] crew of the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']], the Imperial Knights were able to [[Skirmish on Vendaxa|fight off]] the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] and bring the princess back to Bastion. Fel punished them by designating them the Empire's foremost heroes and prime candidates for its most dangerous missions.\n\nOver the next several [[Standard month/Legends|months]], Krieg and Draco were sent to locations such as [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]] and the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order's]] [[Hidden Temple (Sith&ndash;Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]] on [[Taivas]]. On the latter mission, while Marasiah attempted to negotiate an alliance with the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi Council]] against [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt's Empire, Krieg, Draco, and fellow Knight [[Azlyn Rae]] joined a strike team put together by [[Cade Skywalker]], a former Jedi and the [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the ''Mynock''. The team [[Mission to Had Abbadon|journeyed]] to the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] world of [[Had Abbadon/Legends|Had Abbadon]] and set a trap for Darth Krayt, hoping to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] him and destabilize his Sith Order. Krayt took the bait laid by Skywalker and nearly [[Death/Legends|died]] in the ensuing [[Battle on Had Abbadon|battle]], and Fel afterward sent Krieg to the planet [[Kiffex/Legends|Kiffex]] to retrieve Rae, who had been mortally wounded while fighting Krayt and then been taken to Kiffex by Skywalker to be healed. Krieg, Rae, and Draco were later part of a [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] contingent who accompanied the Emperor to [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] in order to finalize [[Mission to Agamar|negotiations]] with the Jedi.\n\nAn [[Alliance (Second Imperial Civil War)|alliance]] was struck, but the process was interrupted by an [[Operation: Thunderstroke|attacking]] group of Sith. The new allies banded together to protect the Emperor and were able to evacuate the planet, although Marasiah did not make it aboard the [[Defender One|escape shuttle]]. Draco then recruited Krieg and the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Shado Vao]] for an infiltration [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|mission]] to the Sith world of [[Korriban]], where they successfully freed Marasiah from her [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisonment]]. Draco remained onworld to buy his allies [[Time/Legends|time]] to escape and was captured by the Sith, but Krieg was soon after reunited with him during a visit to Taivas. Draco had revealed the Hidden Temple's location to the Sith under [[Torture/Legends|torture]]; he and Krieg stood with the rest of the allies and [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|defended]] the temple from attacking Sith forces. After they evacuated to Bastion, Krieg joined a [[Cade Skywalker's strike team|strike team]] that brought down the orbital defenses of Krayt's throneworld of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], which allowed the allied [[Fleet/Legends|fleets]] of the Empire-in-exile, the Jedi, and the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant|Galactic Alliance]] to [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|attack]] the planet. Krayt was killed and the war was won for the allies, although the Emperor died at Draco's hands after falling to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. In the battle's aftermath, Krieg attended Fel's funeral.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rescue at Vendaxa===\n{{Quote|I know my father.

Krayt had claimed the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] shortly after the [[Battle of Caamas|conclusion]] of the [[Sith\u2013Imperial War]], a war between Fel's Empire and the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] that had concluded with Krayt [[Attack on Emperor Fel|seizing control]] of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Krieg accompanied Fel as he arrived on-world, along with two other Imperial Knights, [[Sigel Dare]] and Krieg's trusted friend, [[Antares Draco]]. After securing the loyalty of the Imperial forces stationed on the planet, Fel believed that [[Empire-in-exile|his Empire]] could now become a more potent threat to Krayt. Fel refused to let his new base be discovered, even to the point of forbidding Draco from rescuing his daughter, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Marasiah Fel]], who had been reported missing on [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 3: Broken, Part 3\">[[Legacy (2006) 3|''Legacy'' (2006) 3]]</ref> Draco disobeyed the order and secretly departed Bastion on a rescue mission, accompanied by Krieg.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\">[[Legacy (2006) 6|''Legacy'' (2006) 6]]</ref>\n\nThe two Imperial Knights made their way in stolen [[Predator-class fighter|''Predator''-class fighters]] to [[Vendaxa/Legends|Vendaxa]], where Marasiah and her companion [[Astraal Vao]] had been picked up by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Cade Skywalker]] and had rendezvoused with two [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], [[Wolf Sazen]] and Astraal's brother [[Shado Vao]]. Arriving at the site of Skywalker's grounded [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']], their [[Starfighter/Legends|fighters]] were shot down by a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Fury-class starfighter|''Fury''-class fighter]], but Krieg and Draco managed to escape the flaming wrecks of their ships. They arrived on the scene simultaneously with the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] [[Darth Talon]], [[Darth Nihl]], and a [[Legion/Legends|legion]] of other [[One Sith|Sith]], who had been pursuing Marasiah since her escape from Socorro. Along with the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and the Princess, Krieg and Draco drew their [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] and engaged the Sith in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|combat]]. Despite seven years of tension between the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi]] and Roan Fel's Empire, the Jedi and Imperial Knights [[Skirmish on Vendaxa|fought side-by-side]] against their common enemy, the Sith. A short [[Time/Legends|time]] into the battle, Marasiah was cut down by a [[Unidentified Zabrak Sith (Male)|Zabrak Sith]] while protecting a derelict Skywalker.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\" />\n\nBelieving that a person they had sworn to protect had been [[Death/Legends|killed]], Krieg and Draco fought with renewed vigor, and Krieg managed to kill several Sith. Draco soon realized that the Princess was alive and rushed her aboard the ''Mynock''; Krieg, Skywalker, and the Jedi soon followed. [[Jariah Syn]] and [[Deliah Blue]], respectively the ship's co-[[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]], managed to get the ship off the ground and away from the surviving Sith. Krieg stayed by Marasiah's side as Draco instructed Syn and Blue to set a course for Bastion, and realized that she would soon die. Skywalker, who possessed [[Dark transfer|healing powers]], offered to help, but his offer was met with suspicion from Krieg and Draco, even earning a punch in the face from the latter. As Shado Vao prevented a fight from ensuing, his sister convinced Krieg and Draco to let Skywalker heal Marasiah. After the [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] hunter used his powers to bring her back from the edge of death, the ''Mynock'' safely arrived at Bastion.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 7: Broken, Part 6\" />\n\n===Vendaxa fallout===\n{{Quote|We're going to win back the Emperor's trust.|Antares Draco, speaking for himself and Krieg|Legacy (2006) 9}}\n[[File:Gettingthejobdone.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Krieg and Draco protect Mingo Bovark while aboard the Wheel.]]\nShortly after Skywalker and the Jedi departed Bastion in the ''Mynock'', Fel requested an audience with Draco and Krieg and berated them for having disobeyed a direct order. The [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] believed that the Sith had likely tracked the ''Mynock'' to Bastion and that he now had a stalemate with Krayt's Empire. Expecting a serious punishment, Krieg and Draco were shocked when Fel told them that they would be receiving medals. He was retroactively approving their mission to Vendaxa, rather than having news of their insubordination undermine his authority. Their punishment was thus that they were being declared the Empire's foremost heroes and thenceforth being tasked with its most dangerous missions. He then sent the two on their next mission&mdash;escorting [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Mingo Bovark]] to [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 9|''Legacy'' (2006) 9]]</ref> a [[Space station/Legends|space station]] in the [[Besh Gorgon system/Legends|Besh Gorgon system]] that had remained neutral throughout Fel's conflicts with the Galactic Alliance and the Sith.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> Bovark would be discussing a possible alliance against Krayt with [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]] of the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]], and Krieg and Draco's mission was to ensure Bovark's safety at all costs and to see that the negotiations went smoothly. Before their departure, a ceremony was held where they received their medals.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\" />\n\nAboard the Wheel, Stazi and Bovark met in a conference room, with each participant's set of [[Bodyguard/Legends|guards]] required to wait outside. Krieg and Draco, despite having been required to leave their [[Imperial Knight lightsaber|lightsabers]] aboard their ship, smuggled them aboard the [[Realspace/Legends|space]] station.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 9: Trust Issues, Part 1\" /> While the talks were happening, [[Morrigan Corde]] and [[Jor Torlin]], [[Spy/Legends|spies]] from Krayt's Empire, managed to cause Bovark's [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] to fire on Stazi's ship using a [[Command Override Limpet Droid]], prompting Stazi to believe that Roan Fel had betrayed him. [[Skirmish on The Wheel|A firefight]] erupted between the Imperial Knights and the [[Galactic Alliance Intelligence officer]]s, and Krieg held off the guards while Draco burst into the room to save Bovark from an angry Stazi. Wheel [[Administrator/Legends|Administrator]] [[Pol Temm]] and several [[Wheel Security Force|security guards]] arrived and called on the Imperial Knights to surrender their weapons immediately. Draco refused, and Temm ordered the Imperials off of the Wheel, declaring the station off-limits to all of Roan Fel's forces.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 10: Trust Issues, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 10|''Legacy'' (2006) 10]]</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] later,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 17: Claws of the Dragon, Part 4\">[[Legacy (2006) 17|''Legacy'' (2006) 17]]</ref> Fel received word that Cade Skywalker had escaped from the [[Temple of the Sith]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and enacted a plan to hunt him down. Krieg and Draco were summoned to an audience with the Emperor, but Draco failed to attend. The Emperor lamented his earlier decisions to Krieg, and, worried that Skywalker had divulged Imperial secrets to the Sith,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 23: Loyalties, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]</ref> he sent Krieg, Draco, and the recently knighted Marasiah to the [[Iego system]], where their fellow Knight Azlyn Rae had been dispatched on a mission to locate Skywalker. Undercover and posing as a bounty hunter, Rae confronted Skywalker as he visited his uncle [[Rawk|\"Bantha\" Rawk]] on [[Iego/Legends|Iego]]. Because of her status as a former Jedi [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] and a childhood friend of Skywalker's, Rae was able to learn of the existence of the Jedi Order's [[Hidden Temple (Sith&ndash;Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]]. As she prepared to follow the ''Mynock'' to the temple in [[Azlyn Rae's GPE-7300 transport|her ship]], she relayed its coordinates to Krieg, Draco, and Marasiah, who waited nearby in a [[Sigma-class long-range shuttle|ship of their own]]. Although both Krieg and Draco suspected that she might be setting them up, the three Imperial Knights set a course for the Hidden Temple on [[Taivas]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 24: Loyalties, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 24|''Legacy'' (2006) 24]]</ref> Their hope was to negotiate an alliance between Fel's Empire and the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 25: The Hidden Temple, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 25|''Legacy'' (2006) 25]]</ref>\n\n===Emissary to Taivas===\n{{Quote|Is this how you welcome all visitors, Jedi?''\"<br />\"Uninvited'' visitors who arrive with ''lightsabers'' in hand, yes!|Krieg and Shado Vao, while dueling at the Hidden Temple|Legacy (2006) 25}}\nThe Imperial Knights [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaked]] their ship and followed the ''Mynock'' to the Hidden Temple, landing behind their quarry at one of the base's [[Hangar/Legends|hangars]]. Krieg, Draco, and Marasiah disembarked just as the ''Mynock''{{'s}} crew was being greeted by Wolf Sazen and Shado Vao, Krieg and Draco with their lightsabers drawn in an effort to protect the Princess from any potential danger. Misinterpreted as hostility, the move prompted Vao and Skywalker to draw their own weapons and [[Skirmish at the Hidden Jedi Temple|engage]] the two Imperial Knights in [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duels]]; Krieg dueled Vao and exchanged taunts with the Jedi Knight. Furious that they had hitched a free ride on his ship, and realizing Rae's true identity as an Imperial Knight, Skywalker [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force-pushed]] both Krieg and Draco across the hangar. In response, Marasiah ignited her own lightsaber, informing Skywalker that the Imperial Knights had come on a mission of peace.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 25: The Hidden Temple, Part 1\" />\n\n[[File:Guesswhoscomingtodinner.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Imperial delegation arrives at the Jedi's Hidden Temple.]]\nAfter tensions between the gathered parties had died down, the Imperial delegation was permitted to see the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi Council]]. In the [[Council Chamber (Hidden Temple)|Council Chamber]], Skywalker, Rawk, Sazen, Vao, Krieg, Draco, and Marasiah appeared before [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[K'Kruhk]], [[T'ra Saa]], and [[Tili Qua]]. Saa believed that [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] had allowed the Imperial Knights to come to the Hidden Temple for a reason. Krieg stood by as Marasiah gave a long speech, revealing that her father had not ordered the [[Massacre at Ossus]], and calling on the Jedi to open talks with him so that they might cooperate against their common enemy, the Sith. Skywalker chimed in and proposed a plan of his own: [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt. Although the Jedi Council was taken aback by Skywalker's proposal, the Imperial Knights were impressed by it&mdash;Krieg posited that if the Sith were to fight for the throne amongst themselves, an alliance between Emperor Fel, Gar Stazi, and the Jedi could potentially defeat the Sith Empire.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 25: The Hidden Temple, Part 1\" /> Ultimately, the council did not support the mission, but Skywalker decided to proceed without their assistance. Marasiah assigned Krieg, Draco, and Rae to accompany him on his mission, while she would stay behind to continue negotiating an alliance with the Jedi. Skywalker's [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]], [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], opened the cargo bay doors of the ''Mynock'' and allowed Krieg and Draco to load their TIE Predators into the ship's hold. With their fighters already aboard his ship, Skywalker reluctantly allowed the Imperial Knights to join him on the mission. Vao joined the strike team as well, as the sole representative of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 26: The Hidden Temple, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 26|''Legacy'' (2006) 26]]</ref>\n\nSkywalker formulated a [[Mission to Had Abbadon|plan to lure Krayt]] to the planet [[Had Abbadon/Legends|Had Abbadon]]. En route, Krieg and Draco watched Vao practice lightsaber technique against a [[Remote/Legends|remote]] in the ship's cargo hold, before the ''Mynock'' was drawn out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] by the [[Interdiction field/Legends|interdiction field]] of the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Iron Sun]]'', which the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] Jedi [[Celeste Morne]] had commandeered ten years before and kept dormant in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]]. After the ''Mynock'' was locked in a [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]], and Vao and Skywalker [[Force sense/Legends|sensed]] the presence of a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-user]] on the ship, the crew set out to explore the derelict vessel. Skywalker ordered Krieg and Draco to investigate the corridors connected to the hangar bay, where they found several [[Bone/Legends|bones]], some of which had been gnawed on. After Skywalker, Rae, Vao, and Jariah Syn were attacked by beasts known as [[Rakghoul]]s, Krieg and Draco were joined by Deliah Blue and located Syn and Vao in front of a locked door, along with several apparently tame Rakghouls. Morne was able to control the beasts with the power of the [[Muur Talisman]], an ancient [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] that housed the [[Force ghost|spirit]] of the Sith Lord [[Karness Muur]]. Before anyone could force their way into the door, it opened suddenly, revealing a weary Skywalker and Rae. Morne followed, and, having been impressed by Skywalker's healing abilities, decided to join them on their mission.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 28: Vector, Part 9\">[[Legacy (2006) 28|''Legacy'' (2006) 28]]</ref>\n\n===Battle in the Core===\n{{Quote|If Azlyn will not obey&mdash;worse, if she speaks of what she knows&mdash;I may have to kill her.''\"<br />\"''You'll have to kill me first.|Draco and Krieg argue over new orders given to them by the Emperor|Legacy (2006) 29}}\nWith Morne as their newest passenger, the ''Mynock'' arrived at Had Abbadon, a planet that was under the control of Krayt's Empire. Posing as pilots from the planet's Imperial base, Draco and Krieg flew their TIE Predators after Shado Vao's [[X-83 TwinTail starfighter|TwinTail Fighter]] and blasted grounded [[TIE pilot]]s before they could get to their ships, helping to rid the base of Krayt's Imperials. The base was clear, and as Draco reported to Fel via the [[HoloNet/Legends|holonet]], Krieg found some quiet time with Rae, where the two discussed their feelings for one another. The tender moment was interrupted by Draco, who brought new orders from their Emperor: obtain the Muur Talisman. Seeing the Sith device as evil and disgusted by the order, Rae stormed off, prompting Draco to remark that he would have to kill her if she compromised the mission. In a moment of defiance to his trusted friend<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10\" /> and the leader of the mission,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 30: Vector, Part 11\">[[Legacy (2006) 30|''Legacy'' (2006) 30]]</ref> Krieg told Draco that he would have to kill Krieg first. Tension mounted between the two as they argued over their primary duties as Imperial Knights, and, with the argument unresolved, Krieg walked away.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10\" />\n\n[[File:Ganner_Protect_Azlyn.jpg|thumb|right|375px|Krieg protects Azlyn Rae from Draco during the Battle on Had Abbadon.]]\nLured to Had Abbadon by the bait of the Muur Talisman, Darth Krayt arrived along with four of his most trusted Sith Lords: Darths [[Darth Stryfe|Stryfe]], [[Darth Wyyrlok (III)|Wyyrlok]], Talon, and [[Darth Maladi|Maladi]]. All of the Sith Lords save Wyyrlok confronted Morne and Skywalker, before Krieg, Draco, Rae, and Vao emerged from hiding, having managed to [[Force stealth|conceal themselves in the Force]]. The six members of the strike team [[Battle on Had Abbadon|attacked the Sith]], aided by Morne's [[Army/Legends|army]] of Rakghouls, which ended up cutting the Imperial Knights off from the battle. Krieg and Azlyn were ordered by Draco to take care of Krayt while he attempted to obtain the Talisman. Rae protested, but was angrily Force-pushed away by Draco, who was in turn physically restrained by Krieg. A frustrated Krieg bid Draco to go confront Morne while he and Rae dealt with Krayt.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 30: Vector, Part 11\" />\n\nKrieg and Rae made their way back-to-back through a sea of Rakghouls until Rae saw that Krayt was distracted by Morne. Krieg watched in horror as she [[Shiak|stabbed]] the Dark Lord through the chest; Krayt was then Force-pushed off of a cliff by Morne and nearly killed by his own servant, Darth Wyyrlok. The [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] produced during the confrontation scattered most of the combatants, including Krieg and a mortally wounded Rae. Skywalker was able to [[Shatterpoint/Legends|destroy]] the Talisman and kill Morne, but could not effectively heal Rae with the Force. As the crew of the ''Mynock'' prepared to depart for [[Kiffex/Legends|Kiffex]] with Vao and Rae, Skywalker refused Krieg and Draco passage, as he knew that they had tried to secure the Talisman for their Emperor. Vao held the two Knights back with the Force and the ''Mynock'' left the planet. Krieg, watching the ship depart, questioned the meaning of his duty.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 31: Vector, Part 12\">[[Legacy (2006) 31|''Legacy'' (2006) 31]]</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Bastion, the two were joined by Sigel Dare in appearing before the Emperor, who was not pleased that they had allowed the Talisman to be destroyed, and, without proof, was not entirely convinced that Krayt had been killed. Krieg was sent by Fel to retrieve Rae from Kiffex. He journeyed to the agricultural planet and was directed to the [[Sheyf's Palace|Palace]] of the planet's [[Sheyf]], where a physically and emotionally exhausted Rae was staying as a guest of Sheyf [[Zharia Vos]]. She was being kept alive in a life preserving suit designed by \"Bantha\" Rawk and his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] [[Droo Rawk|Droo]]. Krieg brought her back to Bastion.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 35: Storms, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 35|''Legacy'' (2006) 35]]</ref>\n\n===Peace talks on Agamar===\n{{Quote|Imperial Knights&mdash;Defend your Emperor!|Antares Draco's order to Krieg and a group of other Imperial Knights on Agamar|Legacy (2006) 46}}\nSome time later, Rae was fitted with new armor, crafted by the [[master armorer]] of the Imperial Knights, [[Hogrum Chalk]]. Hoping to get a feel of how she could fight while wearing it, she sparred with Krieg in the [[Imperial Knights quarters]] on Bastion under the direction of Master [[Treis Sinde]] in a session that was observed by Masters Draco, Dare, Chalk, and Emperor Fel.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 43: Monster, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 43|''Legacy'' (2006) 43]]</ref> Krieg then joined a contingent of Imperial Knights and accompanied the Emperor and his daughter to [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] in order to conduct [[Mission to Agamar|peace talks]] with the Jedi Order&mdash;Fel and the Jedi had already forged pacts with the Galactic Alliance, and an agreement between the Empire-in-exile and the Jedi Order would solidify the greater [[Alliance (Second Imperial Civil War)|alliance]]. On the planet's surface, the Imperial Knights made camp for the night on Agamar's [[Grass/Legends|grassy]] plains.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\">[[Legacy (2006) 45|''Legacy'' (2006) 45]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Assindecommands.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Treis Sinde orders Krieg and Sigel Dare to open fire on an uninvited guest to the peace talks on Agamar.]]\nThe next morning, they met with representatives from the Jedi, led by Master K'Kruhk. Everyone present disguised themselves as [[Agamarian]] [[Farm/Legends|farmers]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" /> and several of the Imperial Knights positioned themselves away from the meeting, pretending to work on a nearby field.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" /><ref name=\"Legacy 46\">[[Legacy (2006) 46|''Legacy'' (2006) 46]]</ref> A formal alliance was struck, and Fel declared Bastion a safe haven for both the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance, but the parleying was soon interrupted by an approaching intruder riding a [[Agamarian beast|local animal]]. Master Sinde ordered Krieg and Master Dare to open fire, and the two hit the beast with shots from [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]] until Fel recognized the rider as Nyna Calixte, the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] for Krayt's Empire who had held the same title under Fel's leadership prior to the conclusion of the Sith&ndash;Imperial War. Calixte hurriedly told the assembled party that the Sith were aware of the meeting and had [[Operation: Thunderstroke|sent]] a [[First Sith Imperial Strikeforce|task force]] under the command of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Rulf Yage]] to capture or kill the Emperor. As the task force, led by the [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[War Hammer]]'', engaged Fel's [[Dauntless (Pellaeon-class)|''Dauntless'']] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]], she suggested that the Imperial Knights and Jedi run if they wanted to survive.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" />\n\nThe Imperial Knights and Jedi were quickly advanced upon by a group of Sith emerging from nearby swamps. Draco and K'Kruhk called on their respective parties to defend Emperor Fel, and all disguises were shed as a battle ensued. At least ten Sith fell to the blades of the Imperial Knights and Jedi, as well as to Calixte's [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. Krieg killed a member of the One Sith by slashing his foe's midsection. Draco hailed the Imperial Knights' escape shuttle, ''[[Defender One]]'', which landed near the site of the melee in order to evacuate the Emperor. As Sinde and K'Kruhk began clearing a path toward the shuttle, the surviving Imperial Knights and Jedi boarded, save for Marasiah, Rae, and the Jedi [[Rasi Tuum]], who were too far away. Reminded of his duty to the Emperor by Sinde, Draco gave the order for the shuttle to lift off. ''Defender One'' escaped the planet as the ''Dauntless'' held a corridor of space open for them, taking the brunt of the ''War Hammer''{{'s}} attack and being destroyed in the process.<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" />\n\n''Defender One'' brought the Imperial Knights and Jedi to Bastion. On Agamar, Marasiah was kidnapped by the Sith, but Rae and Tuum stole a [[Sith&ndash;Imperial attack ship]] and returned to Bastion. As the vessel approached the Imperial [[fortress world]], Krieg, Draco, Sinde, Shado Vao, and the Imperial Knights' Master armorer [[Hogrum Chalk]] were roused from their sleep by alarms and rushed to a landing platform. Chalk unsuccessfully attempted to contact the ship, but when Rae contacted Krieg via [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], Chalk ordered Bastion's defensive [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] batteries to cease firing on the ship. When Rae and Tuum landed, a furious Draco began berating them for not having brought Marasiah with them. The ensuing argument was ended when the Emperor summoned them to [[Roan Fel's quarters|his quarters]], however. Fel had received word from his spy in Krayt's Empire that Marasiah had been brought to the Sith world of [[Korriban]], and worried that his daughter knew all of the Empire's codes. He gave Draco three hours to form a plan to rescue her.<ref name=\"extremes2\">[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]]</ref>\n\n===Standing with the Jedi===\n{{Quote|Azlyn did everything she could.

Conversely, Draco planned to use his anger to rescue the princess. Dressing as a member of the One Sith, he harnessed his anger to complete the disguise and [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|went]] to Korriban with Krieg and Vao posing as his captives. On Korriban, Draco bullied a [[Unidentified Neimoidian Sith|Neimoidian Sith]] into allowing them access to the [[Sith Inquisitor|Sith Inquisition]] [[Chambers of Persuasion|chambers]].<ref name=\"extremes2\" /> Therein, they found the princess in chains and exhausted from [[Torture/Legends|torture]], and seized the lightsabers of several Sith guards via telekinesis. The trio quickly disposed of the guards and brought Marasiah back to their ship; she joined in the slaughter of more Sith ''en route''. When a path to the ship was cleared, Draco opted to remain onworld and buy his allies time to escape with the princess. Marasiah protested, but Krieg dragged her to the ship as Draco was rushed by a new group of Sith guards. Krieg and Marasiah manned the vessel's guns as Vao piloted it away from Korriban, but, to their horror, they felt Draco's death in the Force on their way into orbit.<ref name=\"extremes3\">[[Legacy (2006) 50|''Legacy'' (2006) 50]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Whenourpowerscombine.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Krieg and Shado Vao battle Sith forces on Korriban.]]\nAfter their return to Bastion, the Emperor hosted a [[Imperial Knight remembrance ceremony|remembrance ceremony]] to honor both Draco and the Imperial Knights who had fallen on Agamar. Krieg, along with Vao and a large group of Imperial Knights, attended the ceremony.<ref name=\"Legacy War 1\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 1]]''</ref> Krieg, Vao, and Rae were afterward assigned to escort the Princess to Taivas as she met with their new allies. After rendezvousing with Wolf Sazen, they arrived at the Jedi's Hidden Temple. While they were there, the Jedi Council received word from Cade Skywalker that Draco was alive, but had been [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] on Korriban and tortured into revealing the location of the Temple. As Darth Krayt had a personal vendetta against Skywalker, he had Draco [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|frozen]] in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and delivered to Skywalker as a gift. When the ''Mynock'' arrived at Taivas, Krieg, Rae, and Vao met with Skywalker and Draco and brought their broken leader before the Princess. Krieg and Rae watched as she reprimanded Draco for betraying their alliance with the Jedi rather than dying; she was, however, proud of the courage he had displayed while rescuing her, and gave him a chance to regain his honor by helping defend the Hidden Temple from the inevitable attack by the Sith. Krieg then found Draco battle dress that he could wear in place of his armor.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 3]]''</ref>\n\nKrieg, Draco, and Marasiah once again appeared before the Jedi Council with Sazen, Vao, Skywalker, and Rawk, who had reactivated as a Jedi, by their side. The Emperor and Gar Stazi joined the council of war via [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] and pledged their support to the Temple's defense. Skywalker and his uncle devised a plan to stand firm and lure Krayt's forces into the Temple, thereby allowing the fleets of both the Emperor and Gar Stazi to emerge from hyperspace behind them and lock their [[Imperial Navy/Legends|naval]] forces in a trap. The [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|attack]] quickly came, and the four present Imperial Knights stood with Skywalker and the Jedi at the Temple's outer portal as a group of Sith advanced upon them. Krieg and Rae fought side-by-side as they cut down the invaders. When Rawk contacted the Galactic Alliance and Empire-in-exile fleets, their [[Warship/Legends|warships]] arrived in the [[Star system/Legends|system]] to spring their trap.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\" /> A [[Space warfare|space battle]] raged overhead, and Rae and Krieg worked together to down an Imperial [[Walker/Legends|walker]] that marched towards the Temple. When Krayt's secret army of [[Darth Krayt's Sith trooper|Sith troopers]] arrived in-system, a group of them landed on the surface and surrounded the defenders, who had been pushed back to the Temple's council chambers. The Skywalkers and [[Drok|three]] [[Sayar Dun'La|other]] [[Te Corso|Jedi Masters]] remained in the chambers to protect Master [[T'ra Saa]], who was coordinating the allies' defense with [[Battle meditation]], while Krieg and the others retreated. The starships that composed the Hidden Temple then blasted off into the sky and were able to flee the battle, protected by a wave of [[Beam of light|Force energy]] that rose from the ground and by several ships that defected from Krayt's Empire and declared their allegiance to Fel. After having taken heavy losses from the Sith troopers, the surviving allies retreated to Bastion.<ref name=\"Legacy War 4\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 4]]''</ref>\n\n===Into the fire===\n{{Quote|Remember&mdash;We are Imperial Knights. There are none better.|Krieg, to Draco, prior to the Battle of Coruscant|Legacy\u2014War 5}}\nThree days after the Hidden Temple's fall, the Emperor, Admiral Stazi, and the surviving members of the Jedi Council agreed to strike at Krayt's throneworld of Coruscant before Krayt and his Sith troopers could attack Bastion. While preparations were being made, Krieg caught up with Draco in the latter's [[Antares Draco's quarters (Jagged Fel)|quarters]] aboard the Emperor's [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Jagged Fel (starship)|''Jagged Fel'']]. Draco felt that he had betrayed his honor when he was broken by the Sith and worried that he might have been programmed as a [[sleeper agent]], but Krieg urged his friend to reject fear, find strength in the Force, and forge himself anew.<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 5]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Goodadvice-LW5.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Krieg advises Draco aboard the ''Jagged Fel''.]]\nDraco remained at Fel's side aboard the ''Jagged Fel'' during the [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|attack]], but Krieg and Masters Rae and Dare joined a [[Cade Skywalker's strike team|strike team]] that also included Skywalker, Vao, Sazen, Tuum, and Morrigan Corde, a recent defector from Krayt's Empire who had also worn the hat of Director of Imperial Intelligence as her alter ego Nyna Calixte. Syn and Blue brought them to Coruscant in the ''Mynock'' and covertly landed them at a hidden location; their task was to follow Corde to the central [[Computer/Legends|computers]] that controlled the planet's orbital defenses. Two [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]] before the allied fleet was set to arrive in-[[Coruscant system/Legends|system]], the strike team arrived at their target, where Tuum and Rae used telekinesis to blast several technicians away. While the others battled stormtroopers and Sith troopers, Krieg, Vao, and Skywalker destroyed the computers and brought down Coruscant's orbital defenses.<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\" />\n\nUsing secret tunnels that Skywalker and Vao had discovered while studying at the Temple of the Sith&mdash;then the [[New Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]]&mdash;years before, the strike team made their way into the One Sith's Temple, hoping to find Darth Krayt and force him into a showdown with Skywalker. Darth Talon and Darth Stryfe were waiting for them with several other Sith, and a fierce skirmish erupted that saw Master Dare stabbed in the chest and Sazen and Stryfe each cut the other down. Krieg and the others fought on, but Skywalker left to confront Krayt<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\" /> and ultimately killed him. The Sith troopers, whose wills were linked to Krayt through the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], went mad, and the strike team was able to kill the rest of their opponents. The troopers flying [[Annihilator-class starfighter|''Annihilator''-class starfighters]] in the space battle above plummeted their craft toward Coruscant's surface, and the rest of Krayt's fleet fled into hyperspace, ceding control of the capital to the allies. The surviving Sith went into hiding, and the war came to an end.<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 6]]''</ref>\n\nEmperor Fel was one of the battle's casualties, having been slain by Draco himself after attempting to unleash a Sith-created [[Omega Red|pathogen]] onto Coruscant that would kill all life onworld. The Imperial Knights had vowed to kill the Emperor if he were ever to fall to the dark side, and Draco had held true to his oath. In the battle's aftermath, a [[Funeral of Roan Fel|funeral]] was held for Fel; Krieg and Draco stood next to Master Chalk with ignited lightsabers in their hands as the master armorer delivered a eulogy. Chalk also announced the formation of a [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]], composed of Admiral Stazi, Jedi Master K'Kruhk, and the newly-crowned Empress Marasiah, which would unify the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|We serve with honor and if we are asked to sacrifice our honor as our duty, then we are betrayed.|Ganner Krieg to Antares Draco|Legacy (2006) 29}}\n[[File:KriegtheIK.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Ganner Krieg, a calm and serious Imperial Knight]]\nAs an Imperial Knight, Krieg was mindful of the oath of loyalty he had sworn to the Emperor,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\" /> but also placed stock in friendship; his dedication to his trusted friend<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd\">''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd]]''</ref> Antares Draco saw Krieg disobey a direct order from his Emperor when he accompanied Draco to Vendaxa in an effort to rescue Marasiah Fel.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 6: Broken, Part 5\" /> Noted for his calm and serious demeanor,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\" /> and a level-headed foil to the brash actions of Draco, Krieg had reservations about killing Imperials who served Darth Krayt's Empire<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10\" /> and was far less critical of the Jedi than his friend, to the point of praising Shado Vao's skills with a lightsaber.
