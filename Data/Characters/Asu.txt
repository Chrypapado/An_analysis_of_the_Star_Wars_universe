Where we're going is far too sacred for that.|Asu|The Village Bride}}\n'''Asu''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] who lived in [[Meevai Village]] on [[Keelia]] sometime after the [[Clone Wars]]. He was [[Wedding of Asu and Haru|married]] to [[Haru]].<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Biography==\nLocal raider [[Lord]] [[Izuma]], who took over the [[B1-series battle droid]]s left behind on [[Keelia]] by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], at one point demanded his bride Haru's grandfather, the village chief, as collateral to avoid unnecessary conflict with the villagers. Haru and Asu both volunteered to go in his stead, despite repeated protests from her sister [[Saku]]. Haru and Asu's [[Wedding of Asu and Haru|wedding ceremony]] took place the night before they were to be taken.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\nOn the day following the wedding, Haru and Asu turned themselves in to Izuma. Saku and others had secretly organized an ambush on the raiders, but their plans were foiled. When Izuma was ready to execute Saku for being the leader, [[Jedi]] [[F]] intervened and saved her. F's companion [[Valco]] destroyed Izuma's ship, thus disabling his [[B1-series battle droid]]s. In the ensuing chaos, Izuma's associates fled. Izuma then took Haru as hostage. In a swift move, F struck down the raider, and saved Haru, Asu, and the rest of the villagers.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\nSometime later, Asu and other villagers thanked F for her help, and said their farewell to F as the Jedi left the planet.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Asu concept art.png|thumb|Asu concept art]]\nAsu first appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: Visions]]'' short film \"[[The Village Bride]].\" He was voiced by [[Yuma Uchida]] in the original Japanese audio, and by [[Christopher Sean]] in the English dub.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{VisionsCite|The Village Bride}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast|text=Stunning New ''Star Wars: Visions'' Trailer Debuts}} {{1stm}}\n*{{SW|url=series/star-wars-visions/episode-guide-the-village-bride|text=Star Wars: Visions {{!}} \"The Village Bride\" Episode Guide}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Keelia residents]]"}}}]}}}}
