He co-owned the [[Dobo Brothers' Emporium]] along with his brother, [[Dendis Dobo|Dendis]]; although the two established their shops in the same module, each brother held great resentment for the way the other conducted business. Much to the indignation of his brother, Samhan used the shop to run an illicit [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] operation, selling illegally-modded items such as [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] to such organizations as the [[Exchange]]. While Dendis sold only medical supplies and [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] cards, Samhan offered up a number of weapons, including [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblades]], blasters, and [[Grenade/Legends|grenades]], as well as various kinds of [[Armor/Legends|armor]] and upgrades.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|I will admit that I sold it, but I sell a great many things. You cannot hold it against me for doing business, can you?|Dobo, to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nBy the time of the [[Skirmish at Peragus II|destruction]] of [[Peragus II]] in [[3951 BBY]], Dobo was operating part of the [[Dobo Brothers' Emporium]], along with his brother, [[Dendis Dobo|Dendis]]. He was also heavily involved in an illegal [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] ring aboard [[Citadel Station]], in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] over the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Telos IV]]. Among other things, the operation funneled illegal weapons and weapon components to the [[Bumani Exchange Corporation]], which was the local front for the [[Exchange]], a galaxy-spanning criminal syndicate. Also, [[Jana Lorso]], the head of the local [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka]] branch, had Dobo deliver unspecified goods for her. [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Dol Grenn]] of the [[Telos Security Force]] had long been suspicious of the [[Black market/Legends|black market]] dealings that were occurring on the Station; however, he had no concrete evidence to support it and, thus, to bring Dobo to justice.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nWhen a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], [[Meetra Surik]], was retrieving a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] for an [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Chodo Habat's herd|herd]] on Citadel Station, a group of thugs attacked her. After the fight, the droid found a [[modified holdout blaster]] on one of the thugs, which she then presented to Grenn. The Lieutenant realized this was the evidence he needed to dismantle the black market. Grenn then asked Surik to help him find the person or persons responsible for the operation. After showing the blaster to Dobo, Surik persuaded him to reveal that he was in fact the head of the local smuggling ring. Surik agreed to aid Grenn's cause by providing Dobo with the materials he needed for his next illegal shipment. This allowed the TSF officer to catch Dobo in the act. After a brief [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|battle]] in which Dobo lobbed a [[Grenade/Legends|grenade]] at the group of arresting TSF officers, he surrendered, was arrested, and was placed in a [[force cage]] within the TSF headquarters. He swore that one day he would break free and exact his revenge on Surik.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAs a businessman, as well as a smuggler, Dobo often displayed a high degree of pragmatism. While his brother, Dendis, was an idealist who insisted on doing business in a strictly legitimate fashion, Samhan bore no scruples at all, dealing with anyone who could bring more credits his way. As a result, the two brothers had an antagonistic relationship and would even argue with each other in front of a customer. He was also known to be irritable, argumentative and vindictive; when he was arrested by the TSF, he swore vengeance upon those who had set him up, including the Exile.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSamhan Dobo was a character created for [[Obsidian Entertainment]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' [[video game]]. Meetra Surik, the player's character, could have chosen the above course of action or to actually help Dobo with his shipments. If the latter course is chosen, he will reward Surik with [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and access to his \"special reserves.\" Then she could also accompany him to one of the [[Hangar/Legends|docking bays]] on Citadel Station, where she would be confronted by a TSF officer. After failing to convince the officer that she was trying to expose Dobo, Surik would be forced to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the officer. This course of action leads to a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] shift, however. It is therefore assumed non-[[canon]] when compared with the light side option represented in the sections above.<ref name=\"guide\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Telos IV]], if the player explores the TSF station, Dobo's force cage is found to be empty; he may have been killed or moved to another cell, or escaped during the commotion.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Samhan Dobo\n|ru=\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0445\u0430\u043d \u0414\u043e\u0431\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dobo, Samhan}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Duros]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
