When the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Nejaa Halcyon]] was killed, his friend [[Rostek Horn]] married the widow [[Scerra Horn|Scerra Halcyon]] and adopted his son [[Hal Horn|Valin Halcyon]], renaming him Hal Horn to protect him from the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]].\n\nAs Corellian Jedi, the Halcyons/Horns had customs different from other members of the Jedi order, they did not keep the vow of celibacy and readily married and sired children, they generally did not travel beyond Corellian space, keeping their peacekeeping activities to their home system, and passed ritual [[Jedi Credit]]s down through the generations.\n\nHal Horn, like his stepfather before him, became a member of the [[Corellian Security Force]]. Hal and his wife [[Nyche Horn|Nyche's]] son [[Corran Horn]] became one of the notable heroes in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] through his exploits in CorSec, [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] and as a member of the [[New Jedi Order]]. Corran married [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Terrik]], bringing the [[Terrik family]] into the mix. They had a [[Valin Horn|son]] and a [[Jysella Horn|daughter]] who would become [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] themselves, thus carrying on the legacy of the Halcyon family.\n\nThe [[Gender/Legends|male]] Halcyon/Horn Jedi were notably lacking in [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetic]] abilities, but particularly strong in the area of altering minds with [[Mind trick/Legends#Force illusion|illusions]] and the rare ability to absorb energy using the Force, known as [[tutaminis]]. Corran would discover, like his grandfather before him, that he could use this absorbed energy to fuel sometimes spectacular feats of telekinesis, as he did on [[Courkrus]] when he confronted [[Shala]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]].\n\n==Family tree==\n{{FamilyTree/start}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | |KEIRAN | | | | | | | | | ||KEIRAN=[[Keiran Halcyon]]}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | |TIME | | | | | | | | | | ||TIME=Unknown generations}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | |ROSTEK|y|SCERRA|y|NEJAA| | | | | | | | | ||ROSTEK=[[Rostek Horn]]|SCERRA=[[Scerra Horn|Scerra Halcyon]]|NEJAA=[[Nejaa Halcyon]]}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | |ADOPTION | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | ||ADOPTION=by adoption}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | |`|-|-|.|!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | |HAL|y|NYCHE| |BOOSTER|y|JYSELLA|HAL=[[Hal Horn|Valin \"Hal\" Horn]]|NYCHE=[[Nyche Horn]]|BOOSTER=[[Booster Terrik]]|JYSELLA=[[Jysella Terrik]]}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | |CORRAN |~|~|y|~|~|MIRAX| ||CORRAN=[[Corran Horn]]|MIRAX=[[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Terrik]]}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | | | | | | | | |VALIN| |SELLA| | | | ||VALIN=[[Valin Horn]]|SELLA=[[Jysella Horn]]}}\n{{FamilyTree/end}}\n\n==Family album==\n<gallery>\nFile:Halcyon.jpg|[[Keiran Halcyon]]\nFile:HalHorn.jpg|[[Hal Horn]]\nFile:CorranHorn-NEGTC2.jpg|[[Corran Horn]]\nFile:Mirax1.jpg|[[Mirax Terrik Horn]]\nFile:Njo_valinhorn.jpg|[[Valin Horn]]\nFile:Njo_jysellahorn.jpg|[[Jysella Horn]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n\"[[Wikipedia:Halcyon|Halcyon]]\" is an old-English name for a species of colorful diving bird, known today as a \"[[Wikipedia:kingfisher|kingfisher]]\".
