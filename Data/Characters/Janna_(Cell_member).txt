This character's skill would depend on the player character's and a dice roll. Should the player character compete with this person, Janna would appear dead soon afterwards, killed by The Cell because the PC could filter Janna's name as a Cell member.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[TopWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
