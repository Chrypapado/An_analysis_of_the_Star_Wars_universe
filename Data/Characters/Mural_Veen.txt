The [[Nihil]] [[Tempest Runner]] [[Kassav Milliko]] attempted to extort Governor Veen when Eriadu was threatened by [[Eriadu system Emergence|one]] of the [[Emergences]] of the [[Great Hyperspace Disaster]], claiming to be able to prevent the imminent Emergence from harming Eriadu. After two fragments of the ''[[Legacy Run]]'' entered the [[Eriadu system]], one hitting a cluster of [[lommite]] cargo [[transport]]s, Veen acquiesced, transferring the [[credit]]s that Milliko demanded. However, Milliko failed to prevent the third and final fragment in the Emergence from colliding with the [[Eriadu's inhabited moon|inhabited moon]] of Eriadu. Enraged at having been apparently double-crossed, Veen vowed to wreak vengeance upon Milliko and his ilk, personally leading an Eriaduan [[fleet]] into the [[Battle of Kur]] against the Nihil of Milliko's [[Kassav's Tempest|Tempest]] alongside the [[Republic Defense Coalition]]. Near the end of the battle, Veen requested to board Milliko's [[flagship]], the ''[[New Elite]]'', shooting and [[Death|killing]] Milliko personally.<ref name=\"Light of the Jedi\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The High Republic: Light of the Jedi]]'' {{1st|[[The High Republic: Light of the Jedi (audiobook)|''The High Republic: Light of the Jedi'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[The High Republic: Light of the Jedi (audiobook)|''The High Republic: Light of the Jedi'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlng\n|pl=Mural Veen\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Veen, Mural}}\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
