At the time of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] war with [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]], Hrakness served in the New Republic military as a [[Captain/Legends|captain]]. He took command of the [[CR90 corvette/Legends|Corellian Corvette]] [[Ession Strike|''Night Caller'']] after it had been wrested from the service of [[Apwar Trigit]] and Warlord Zsinj by Wraith Squadron.\n\nReplacing [[Zurel Darillian|Captain Zurel Darillian]] as the vessel's commander, Hrakness used his skills as a naval captain to help deceive Trigit's forces and masquerade the New Republic forces under [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles's]] command as loyal minions of Zsinj. Hrakness advised [[Garik Loran]], [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], and [[Myn Donos]] on the dress and mannerisms associated with stereotypical Agamari to help disguise them for a mission. He also wore a black and silver uniform to simulate the dead Captain Darillian on the bridge of the ''Night Caller'' during battle.\n\nHrakness was killed when the ''Night Caller''{{'s}} bridge was destroyed during the Battle of Talesea, and succeeded as captain of the ship by [[Atril Tabanne]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Choday Hrakness\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hrakness, Choday}}\n[[Category:Agamari]]\n[[Category:Alliance Military members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Defense Fleet captains]]"}}}]}}}}
