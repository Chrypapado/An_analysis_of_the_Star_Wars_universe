We owe our loyalty to a throne, not a man!|Kiefer|Legacy (2006) 3}}\n'''Kiefer''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] in the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]] stationed on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]]. After [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]] was [[Attack on Emperor Fel|overthrown]] by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Darth Krayt]], a number of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]] remained loyal to Fel. However, Kiefer&mdash;who believed that it was his duty to serve whomever was on the throne, rather than a specific individual&mdash;in turn was loyal to Krayt. When Fel [[Fall of Bastion|arrived]] on Bastion in [[137 ABY]], Kiefer commanded him to surrender. However, Fel refused to do so, and much to Kiefer's dismay, none of the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] accompanying the lieutenant enforced his order. Kiefer responded by drawing his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Fel himself, but before he could do so, [[General/Legends|General]] [[Oron Jaeger]] shot and killed him.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|The true emperor, Darth Krayt, has ordered your arrest. Surrender!|Kiefer to Roan Fel|Legacy (2006) 3}}\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Kiefer served as a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] in the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]] on [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]], the former [[Planet/Legends|throneworld]] of the [[Fel Empire]], as of [[137 ABY]]. When former [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]]&mdash;who had been [[Attack on Emperor Fel|overthrown]] by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], [[Darth Krayt]], [[130 ABY|seven years before]]&mdash;[[Fall of Bastion|arrived]] on the planet, Kiefer greeted him and demanded that he surrender, claiming that Fel was now an [[Empire-in-exile|exile]]. The lieutenant was loyal to Darth Krayt, as he believed that his loyalty belonged not to a specific man, but to the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]], no matter who that was.<ref name=\"legacy3\" />\n\nHowever, to Kiefer's chagrin, Fel instead stated that he was there to take control of the planet, causing Kiefer to order the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] accompanying him to shoot Fel. When they ignored the lieutenant, instead bowing to Fel, Kiefer drew his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], stating that he would execute his orders. Before Kiefer could shoot, however, [[General/Legends|General]] [[Oron Jaeger]]&mdash;who still considered Fel to be the true ruler&mdash;fired at Kiefer, [[Death/Legends|killing]] him.<ref name=\"legacy3\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Well, I know my duty, and I will execute it!|Kiefer|Legacy (2006) 3}}\nKiefer believed that his loyalty was to the throne, not the being who held it, and thus considered Fel a fugitive from justice, as Krayt had called for his arrest. Kiefer did not understand why no one else ordered Fel to surrender, and so when the stormtrooper contingent with him refused to kill the former Emperor, Kiefer attempted to take matters into his own hands.<ref name=\"legacy3\" />\n\nFel believed that Kiefer was just one of many men who had been brainwashed by Darth Krayt and [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|his new policies]]. He had [[black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and light skin.<ref name=\"legacy3\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nKiefer wore an [[Imperial officer's uniform/Legends|Imperial officer's uniform]] and was armed with a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]].<ref name=\"legacy3\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKiefer's only appearance is in the third issue of the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series, [[Legacy (2006) 3|''Broken, Part 3'']], published on [[September 13]], [[2006]].
