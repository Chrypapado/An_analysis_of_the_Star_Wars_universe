During the [[Mandalorian Wars]] the Beks joined the [[Taris Resistance]] against the Mandalorians, but were forced to retreat down to the [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]].\n\nThe Hidden Beks faced increased pressure from one of the rival gangs, the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]], when former gang member [[Brejik]], joined the Vulkars, and turned the gang rivalry into a war waged on Lower City streets which claimed many lives. Former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]], Revan, encountered the Hidden Beks in [[3956 BBY]] and they formed an alliance to end the war in the Beks favor and rescue the young [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Bastila Shan]] from the Vulkars. Along with Revan, the Hidden Beks were victorious in a swoop race against the Vulkars and Revan recovered Bastila and killed the defiant Brejik.\n\n==History==\n===Mandalorian Wars===\nSince [[3976 BBY]] the Beks had been at war with the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Vulkars]], in which they used [[Swoop racing/Legends|Swoop Racing]] as a compedition for their rivalry. In the year [[3964 BBY]] the Hidden Beks were a known gang operating out of the [[Lower City]] on the planet [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] led by [[Gadon Thek]]. During the [[Taris Siege|Siege of Taris]] in [[3963 BBY]], during the [[Mandalorian Wars]], the Beks launched counterattacks against the Mandalorian invaders and the fugitive [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Marn Hierogryph|Marn \"Gryph\" Hierogryph]] joined to help lead resistance. Gryph's companion, [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] fugitive, [[Zayne Carrick]] later joined the Beks on Taris, although the gang remained wary of the Zayne since he was the declared orchestrator of the [[Padawan Massacre]] on Taris. However, Zayne proved himself trustworthy when he absolved the Hidden Beks of kidnapping the children of [[Noana Sowrs]], the top law enforcement official on Taris.\nThe Beks now believed they could be trusted to join the [[Taris Resistance]] lead by officials they used to be at odds against as a gang. However, their first meeting was interrupted when a member of the resistance, [[Shel Jelavan]], fired on Zayne, but Gadon believed there was no way Zayne would murder kids and defended Zayne. The different parties resolved their differences for the time being and together planned an counter attack against the Mandalorian invasion leader, [[Cassus Fett]], at the [[Jedi Tower]]. However, the Mandalorians discovered the plot and launched their own ambush. The surviving Beks hid in the [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]] of Taris in order to escape further attacks.\n\n===Post-Mandalorian Wars===\nAt some time during the next seven years, [[Gadon Thek]], was blinded in a swoop accident, at which point he was expected to step down and relinquish leadership to his adopted son [[Brejik]]. When he didn't, Brejik took revenge by taking over a rival swoop gang, the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]], and was joined by several renegade Beks.\n\n===Jedi Civil War===\nWhen amnesiac former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] arrived on Taris during the [[Jedi Civil War]], Brejik had stolen a swoop [[Prototype accelerator|accelerator]] from the Beks and planned to use it in the up coming [[Tarisian Season Opener]] [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop race]]. Revan was asked by Gadon to steal it back. After raiding the Vulkar facility, Revan brought it back to the [[Hidden Bek Base]], and used it in a swoop race to win the freedom of [[Bastila Shan]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Overview==\nThe Beks were known for their stance against galactic slavery and were very loyal to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].\n\nWhile not a full Bek because of her age like [[Griff Vao|her brother]], [[Mission Vao]] was a loyal ally of the Beks.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n[[File:Hiddenbekbase.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Hidden Bek base]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 1|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 1]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 2|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 2]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 4|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 4]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Knights of Suffering]]''\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 25|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 25]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Geheime Bek\n|es=Beks Ocultos\n|pl=Ukryci_Bekowie\n|fi=Hidden Beks\n|ru=\u0421\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u0411\u0435\u043a\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hidden Beks| ]]\n[[Category:Swoop gangs]]\n[[Category:Tarisian culture]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
