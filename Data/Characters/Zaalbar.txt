That's all I know, really. Big Z doesn't like to talk about it. In case you didn't notice he's the strong, silent type.|Mission Vao|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Zaalbar''' {{Pronounced|'z\u0251lb\u0251\u0279}}, also nicknamed \"'''Big Z'''\" by [[Mission Vao]], was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who aided the former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] in his quest throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] to find and destroy the [[Star Forge]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]]. Originating from the [[Mid Rim]] Wookiee [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], Zaalbar was the son of [[Wookiee Chieftain]] [[Freyyr]], but had been exiled from his homeworld. Zaalbar was considered in Wookiee culture to be a [[madclaw]], a title of dishonor, as he had attacked his brother [[Chuundar]] with his climbing claws, violating a Wookiee code of conduct. Despite his brother's deals with [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]], which had led to their fight, Zaalbar's father did not believe his accusations against Chuundar. Leaving Kashyyyk, Zaalbar traveled to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] where he encountered and befriended the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] orphan Mission Vao. Zaalbar and Vao traveled everywhere on Taris together. The two protected one another in the absence of any other companions and a close bond was forged between them. Also, the duo affiliated themselves with the [[Lower City]] gang known as the [[Hidden Beks]].\n\nWhen the amnesiac Revan traveled to the planet alongside [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] soldier [[Carth Onasi]] and began a search for the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Bastila Shan]], whom they needed to find to aid the Republic war effort against the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]], they encountered Vao and Zaalbar. After Zaalbar was captured by [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] slavers and held prisoner in the [[Undercity sewers|sewers]] of the Undercity, Vao turned to Revan and his companions for help in rescuing the Wookiee. With their combined abilities, Revan and his party were able to do so ending with Zaalbar swearing a life debt to, the-then amnesiac, Revan. Escaping Taris with Revan and his companions after the [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]] of the planet that resulted in the [[destruction of Taris]], Zaalbar agreed to travel around the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] with Revan and his companions to search for the ancient [[Star Map]] artifacts which would lead them to the Star Forge. As one of the Star Maps was located on Kashyyyk, Zaalbar returned to his homeworld with Revan in search of it. With Revan's help, he cleared his name and liberated his homeworld from the slaving operations of the pan-galactic [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]]. He parted ways with Revan after the [[Battle of Rakata Prime|defeat]] and [[Death/Legends|death]] of Sith Lord [[Darth Malak]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quotetrans|Our claws are tools, not weapons. To use them in battle is to become an animal. It is madness without honor.|Zaalbar|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\n[[File:Zaalbar2431.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Zaalbar on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]]]\n\nA son of the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Wookiee Chieftain|Chieftain]] [[Freyyr]], Zaalbar was born on the Wookiee [[Homeworld/Legends|home]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] prior to the [[Jedi Civil War]]. Zaalbar's tribe came under the attention of numerous [[Slavery/Legends|slaving]] organizations across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], such as the unscrupulous [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]]. After Zaalbar discovered that his brother, [[Chuundar]], was making deals with slavers to sell Wookiees to them, he went mad with rage and attacked Chuundar. During the fight, Zaalbar broke an important Wookiee code and used his claws as weapons. Though Chuundar survived the attack, Zaalbar was consequently branded a [[madclaw]] and exiled from his village, [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]], and Kashyyyk as a whole.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nDuring his exile, Zaalbar traveled to the planet [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. Upon his arrival, the Wookiee got into trouble in Taris' [[Lower City]]; a few gang members of the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]], a [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] gang of Taris, began trying to fight the lone Wookiee. Although Zaalbar did not allow himself to be goaded into fighting, a young [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] orphan, [[Mission Vao]], who was observing the altercation, believed Zaalbar to be in danger. Vao attacked one of the Vulkars, but he knocked her down. Big Z retaliated by grabbing the Vulkar who had done so by the [[throat]], scaring the others off. After that, Zaalbar and Vao became inseparable, traveling everywhere together. Zaalbar's strength allowed Vao to gain physical protection against swoop gangs and local thugs, while Mission's abilities to break open locks, as taught to her by her brother [[Griff Vao|Griff]], were able to benefit the Wookiee. Zaalbar and Vao then affiliated themselves with the [[Hidden Beks]], a gang based around the swoop racing sport popular on Taris at the time.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n===Revan===\n{{Quote|Keep your pet on a leash or you'll be wearing him.|A Czerka Corporation guard on Zaalbar to Revan.|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\nWhen the amnesiac [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] served on the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Starship/Legends|ship]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'', the ship came under [[Attack on the Endar Spire|attack]] by the forces of [[Darth Malak]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]]. After the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] forces overpowered the ''Endar Spire'', and the Republic was forced to call an evacuation order, a multitude of Republic escape pods fled to the planet's surface. One of the pods contained Revan and Republic [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] [[Carth Onasi]]. Upon landing, they searched the planet for Jedi Knight [[Bastila Shan]]. Shan was another refugee from the ''Endar Spire'', and Shan was considered an important asset for the Republic in battles, due to her ability to use the [[The Force/Legends|Force]] power [[battle meditation]]. Zaalbar encountered Revan and his companion when Zaalbar was part of the Hidden Beks. Zaalbar and Vao first saw Revan in [[Javyar's Cantina]]. In the cantina, Zaalbar was scaring off a group of Black Vulkars who were harassing Vao.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nZaalbar and Vao briefly spoke with Revan upon first meeting him and his companion. Later, however, Zaalbar was captured by [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] slavers, and taken to the Undercity sewers on his way to be sold on as a slave. Vao enlisted Revan's help to rescue Zaalbar from the Undercity sewers where he was being held. Revan proceeded to enter the sewers and subsequently attack and kill a number of the Gamorrean slavers, liberating Zaalbar from his confines. Zaalbar, during his imprisonment, had not been fed, and the only nutrition had received was when he had bitten a piece out of one of the arms of one of his Gamorrean oppressors. In the wake of his rescue by Revan, Zaalbar swore a [[Life debt/Legends|life debt]] to the former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]], a Wookiee vow which meant he pledged his life to the protection of Revan. As a result, Zaalbar became a member of Revan's crew and joined him in his quest to find the [[Star Map]]s, maps that would lead to the superweapon called the [[Star Forge]]. Wherever Zaalbar went, Vao swore she would follow, so she joined Revan's party as well.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n[[File:Zaalbar.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Zaalbar with a [[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcaster]].]]\n\n===Return to Kashyyyk===\n{{Quotetrans|I have been away from Kashyyyk for a long time, but things look the same as I left them. Slavers still hold my people prisoner.|Zaalbar|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nWhen Revan and his companions arrived on Kashyyyk, where Zaalbar's brother Chuundar had seized power from their father, Zaalbar was imprisoned by his brother for not honoring his exile as a madclaw. Revan learned that Chuundar had sold a number of his fellow Wookiees as slaves to Czerka Corporation, but only a few in the tribe knew this fact; the rest saw Chuundar as a great hero. Chuundar asked Revan to kill another madclaw Wookiee exile who had taken up residence in the [[Shadowlands/Legends|Shadowlands]], the dangerous area beneath the planet's trees, in order for them to be allowed to leave with Zaalbar. Revan, having seen in a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] the location of the Star Map on the forest floor, agreed, as he felt he would be able to search for the Star Map at the same time. After journeying to the Shadowlands, Revan and his companions discovered that the exile was Freyyr, father of Zaalbar and Chuundar.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nInstead of killing Freyyr, Revan helped the old Wookiee retrieve [[Bacca's Ceremonial Blade]], a [[Vibrosword/Legends|vibrosword]] of great importance to the Wookiees, which had been embedded in the skin of a [[Terentatek/Legends|terentatek]] beast. Freyyr then led a [[Rebellion on Kashyyyk|revolt against Chuundar and Czerka Corporation]], resulting in Chuundar being killed. In the wake of Chuundar's death, Freyyr resumed his position as chieftain of the tribe, giving Bacca's Ceremonial Blade to his son, Zaalbar. This indicated, in Wookiee culture, that his son would succeed him as chieftain. Zaalbar accepted this gift, but told his father that he had to honor his life debt to Revan, and follow him on his quest around the galaxy. Zaalbar told his father that he would return to Kashyyyk when their quest to find the Star Maps was complete, and the Star Forge destroyed.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nAfter the Star Maps led them to the uncharted planet [[Lehon]], Carth Onasi was able to give the location of the Star Forge to Republic [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Forn Dodonna]]. Dodonna brought her ships to Lehon, triggering the [[Battle of Rakata Prime]]. Zaalbar, Revan, and the rest of Revan's companions had been led to Lehon after finding Star Maps on the planets of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]], [[Korriban]] and Kashyyyk, with the maps directing them toward Lehon in order to find the Star Forge. A team of Jedi alongside Revan and his companions, including Zaalbar, boarded the Star Forge. Under Sith resistance, including that of the captured Bastila Shan, who had turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and was aiding Malak, Revan's party eventually reached Shan and redeemed her. Subsequently, Revan defeated and killed Malak, before destroying the Star Forge. Following the destruction of the Star Forge, Zaalbar attended a ceremony on Lehon were Revan was awarded the [[Cross of Glory]] by the commanding Republic officer Admiral [[Forn Dodonna]].<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\nOver the [[3955 BBY|next year]], Zaalbar and Vao built an import export business for themselves. When Revan was embarking on a mission to locate [[Mandalore's Mask]] in [[3954 BBY]], he decided against taking Vao and Zaalbar with him, wanting to let them live their lives in peace. After he retrieved the mask, Revan left the galaxy for the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]], leaving Zaalbar behind with the rest of his former party.<ref name=\"Revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''</ref> A [[holostatue]] of Zaalbar was erected in the [[Leisure Garden]] section of the [[Axial Park]] in the [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], along with the statues of Revan and his other companions in memory of their deeds.<ref name=\"Statues\">{{TORcite|type=faction|Republic|Bonus: Restoring the Statues|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I keep telling Zaalbar to brush those choppers of his, but he never listens. Just stay upwind when he's speaking and you'll be fine.|[[Mission Vao]] to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nZaalbar was a shy Wookiee of few words, preferring to let the street-smart Mission Vao do most of the talking. He was very protective of the young Twi'lek, and would sacrifice himself for her without hesitation. Still, even as he trusted her, and trusted Revan, he found it difficult to express certain aspects of himself and of his culture, feeling they were private and not for outsiders to know. An important trait of Zaalbar's was his loyalty, and a strong sense of Wookiee honor and tradition, as shown by his dedication to his life debt.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Zaalbar also maintained keeping his past life secret from even those he trusted most, as he found it painful to discuss and share it.<ref name=\"databank\" />\n\nZaalbar also appeared to have a low opinion of himself. When asked by Revan if he could help him with a problem, Zaalbar expressed his belief that he would be of little use &ndash; unless, of course, he needed someone threatened or a door bashed open.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nZaalbar also took care of his appetite. During his capture on Taris, he was so hungry that he even tried to bite off a Gamorrean guard's arm. When the ''Ebon Hawk'''{{'s}} food supply started getting low, he was the first one to notice it. Revan might have suspected him at first, of stealing and eating the supplies, but it turned out to be a [[Sasha ot Sulem|young girl]] who had sneaked aboard. Vao was also constantly teasing Zaalbar about his bad breath and appearance.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nWhen Zaalbar discovered that his companion was in fact Revan, he showed indifference to who Revan had once been and pledged to continue his life debt, believing Revan to be a changed man.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n==Talents and abilities==\n{{Quotetrans|Unless you want someone threatened or a door bashed in, you should ask someone else.|Zaalbar to Revan, on his abilities.|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Zaalbar_Tatooine.png|thumb|left|200px|Zaalbar terrorizing two members of the Sand People on Tatooine.]]\n\nZaalbar's skills lay in physical combat, and a strong constitution.<ref name=\"databank\" /> Zaalbar was a dedicated warrior and fighter, able to wield a number of weapons including melee weapons, such as vibroblades, to the weapon called the [[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcaster]], which was favored by Wookiees. Dangerous when angered, this was demonstrated by Zaalbar's choice to tear a chunk out of the arm of a Gamorrean slaver who was keeping him prisoner with his bare teeth.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Zaalbar was also a strong guardian, protecting the young Mission Vao in the Undercity of Taris.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /><ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> Zaalbar's strength was also evident from his ability to easily pick up foes, as he did with those who were attacking him when he first met Mission. He was also able to do this on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he was able to pick up [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]].<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nIn terms of abilities of construction, Zaalbar was capable of making grenades for Revan and his party, doing so on numerous occasions. His personal possessions included a [[Zaalbar's bowcaster|custom-crafted bowcaster]] and later, the sacred [[Bacca's Ceremonial Blade]] after the Wookiee rebellion on Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> In terms of linguistic skills, Zaalbar was able to understand the languages of [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], [[Twi'leki/Legends|Twi'leki]], [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]], [[Ithorese/Legends|Ithorese]], and [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]], though only able to speak the latter due to the limitations of Wookiee vocal capabilities.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Zaalbarart.jpg|thumb|150px|Early concept art of Zaalbar.]]\nZaalbar first appeared in the [[2003]] video game ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' as a playable character. The character has different options open to the player throughout the game, including [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] and [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] choices. An alternate dark side choice allows the player to side with Chuundar and kill Freyyr, thus making Zaalbar become cold hearted and darker in character. He will then tell Revan that he will side with him, but only because his brother Chuundar has taught him about using outsiders for their own advantage. This leaves Kashyyyk under the control of Czerka Corporation.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /><ref name=\"databank\" />\n\nAnother dark side option is available on Lehon. The player can persuade Zaalbar to kill Mission Vao as a payment of the life debt he has sworn. The player can also decide to kill Zaalbar at this point in the game. If the player has him kill Vao and chooses him as a party member on the Star Forge, he will remember his act and attack Revan for forcing him to kill his best friend.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Zaalbar, along with Carth Onasi, Bastila Shan, Canderous Ordo, and Mission Vao, was inspired by [[James Ohlen]]'s work on roleplaying campaigns for [[West End Games]].<ref name=\"Insider\">{{InsiderCite|144|Gaming the Expanded Universe: Ten Years of Knights of the Old Republic}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Revan'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Hologram}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|144|Gaming the Expanded Universe: Ten Years of Knights of the Old Republic}}\n*{{DB|character|missionvao|Vao, Mission|archivedate=20110524234455}}\n*{{DB|character|zaalbar|Zaalbar|archivedate=20110524234605}}\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Black Series|text=''Star Wars: The Black Series Gaming Greats''|pack=Zaalbar|altlink=https://www.gamestop.com/toys-collectibles/collectibles/figures/products/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-zaalbar-the-black-series-action-figure-only-at-gamestop/11113854.html|archiveurl=https://archive.vn/7yf35}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Wookiee Chieftain]]<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n|years=\n|before=[[Freyyr]]<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n|before-years=[[3956 BBY]]&mdash;<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /><ref>''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n|after=Eventually [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]]<ref name=\"GB\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]''</ref>\n|after-years=\n}}\n{{End_box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki}}\n\n{{K1char}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zaalbar#legends\n|fr=Zaalbar\n|pl=Zaalbar\n|pt=Legends:Zaalbar\n|ru=\u0417\u0430\u0430\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0440\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hidden Beks]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Wookiee Chieftains]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
