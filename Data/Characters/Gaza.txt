Think how well you'd sleep&hellip;|Gaza speaks with the Alliance delegation|Star Wars (1977) 88}}\n'''Gaza''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who was one of the foremost members of the [[Herdessan Guild]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Herdessa/Legends|Herdessa]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nAlongside [[Brylin]], the spokesman, and [[Tof (Human)|Tof]], his aide, the three ruled over the planet's populace. Their oppressive government relied on the use of their [[Herdessan shocktrooper|security forces]], led by the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Lumiya]]. Lumiya, a member of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], brought an Imperial presence to the world sometime after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. Since a large percentage of the population was afraid to stand up to the government for fear of losing their homes, the guild was able to easily oppress the poor members of society, selling them into [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] and using [[Torture/Legends|torture]] if they attempted to resist.\n\nEventually, the [[Alliance of Free Planets]] visted Herdessa to negotiate a possible membership into the new growing government. However, Herdessa, already allied with the Empire, was not interested. Gaza and the other guild members entertained the Alliance delegation, which included [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], but refused to discuss political matters. At the end of the day, they took most of the Alliance prisoner, intent on selling them into slavery. Organa, who had escaped capture, was able to rally the oppressed citizens, and they [[Battle of Herdessa (Nagai\u2013Tof War)|rose up]] against the guild and their allies. Gaza and the other guild members were taken into Alliance custody and held answerable for their crimes.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 88|''Star Wars'' (1977) 88]] {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Herdessans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
