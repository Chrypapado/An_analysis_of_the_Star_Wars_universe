He was not Nirama's second-in-command, but rather was a representative of the [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] [[Smugglers' Confederation|in Nirama's organization]], and held a bit of power in the [[Organization]]. He stood in the background and pulled strings, being the one who gave most of the orders to the smugglers.<ref name=\"LFC\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nLen Markus was not a true [[albino]], but he had an appearance similar to one, being very pale. If he wanted to accentuate his paleness, he would dress in light colors, or wear dark clothing if he wanted to blend in. Markus was very personable, with a charming smile. He did not inspire trust, but he was able to make others believe that he trusted them, even if he didn't. He was two-faced, shifted his allegiances and positions, and generally acted as a criminal lieutenant was expected to act. Nirama found Markus, and his attempts to placate Nirama with delicacies from all over the galaxy, to be amusing.<ref name=\"LFC\" /> Nevertheless, Nirama trusted Markus even in times of distress, when trust was a luxury Nirama could hardly afford.<ref name=\"TW\">''[[TopWorld]]''</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], Nirama's pilot [[Arraxx]] was racing through the moon of [[Eskaron]]. Arraxx crossed paths with a private race between [[Blood Raptors]] member [[Gael Kinner]] and intimidated entrepreneur [[Teeloo]]. To avoid collision, Kinner shot Arraxx's ship and destroyed it, making Nirama loose money, assets and his temper in front of people he respected. Upset, Nirama ordered Markus to bring both Kinner's and Teeloo's ships and crew, undamaged. Markus took five Human thugs, two [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshans]] and one [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]], and tracked the racers to [[Tolea Biqua]]. He intimidated them arriving in a raven-black [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]], privately talked with Teeloo, and kidnapped all of them, taking them to Nirama's mansion in [[Mikish]]. At that point, he could not imagine what would be the punishment for something like that.<ref name=\"POB\" />\n\nMarkus notified Nirama that he had brought the offenders, and he was present while Nirama questioned each of the groups in turn. When Nirama was finished with the Raptors, Markus offered the Raptors's personal items and weapons to Teeloo's allies, as the Raptors were in no condition to use them any longer. Nirama asked Teeloo to stay a little longer than his crew, and Markus tried his best to calm the crew and convince them that Nirama had already outed his wrath with the Raptors, so he would not harm Teeloo. Markus was right: Nirama was ''hiring'' Teeloo at that point.<ref name=\"POB\" />\n\nSome months later, Markus escorted Nirama to his main weapon storage facility, [[Rothe Gate]]. Nirama wanted to go there following a lead on his missing employee [[Jobril]], which he believed was connected to [[The Cell]], a faction of his Organization who opposed to Nirama's lead. Nirama wanted to meet with some people who had information on these subjects, he gave a speech with Markus to his left, and then began some audiences. Markus remained at the door, checking any incoming person for potential threats. The Cell attempted to assassinate Nirama during this meetings, but Markus and other employees successfully protected the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]].<ref name=\"UW\" />\n\nAt some point, Markus heard about the [[Darkstaff]] and sought it out. He eventually located it, but was pursued by some of the [[Cularin system]]'s heroic individuals. As Markus passed over the [[Almas Sith fortress]] with the Darkstaff, the fortress emitted a tremendous blast of [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]], engulfing his ship. Len Markus, the Darkstaff, and his ship disappeared. Simultaneously, the entire Cularin system disappeared from [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], only to reappear suddenly almost ten years later with no noticeable passage of time within the system.<ref name=\"AMA\">''[[A Mon Alone]]''</ref>\n\nLen Markus was considered missing, and Nirama promoted [[Nadin Paal]] to fill in the void. Markus was, however, alive and well, although the Darkstaff suffered damage during the attack. Wanting to repair the Darkstaff, Markus contacted [[Chevin/Legends|Chevin]] slaver [[Phylus Mon]]. Markus wanted Phylus Mon to travel to Almas and use Sith rituals to repair the Darkstaff. In exchange for this, Markus offered Phylus Mon the secret of the [[Sith battlelord]] rituals. Phylus Mon accepted the deal, because the rituals would allow him to have an enslaved army.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[An Uneasy Peace]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Price of Business]]''\n*''[[TopWorld]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[UnderWorld]]''\n*''[[Blown Away]]''\n*''[[Philology]]''\n*''[[Here and Thaere]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Air Up Thaere]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[No Place Like Home]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Open Aarms]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Belly of the Beaast]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Paarty On!]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Incursion]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Recursion]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]''\n*''[[Decision: Almas]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Showdown (Living Force)|''Showdown'']] {{Mo}}\n*''[[A Plague of Darkness]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Destruction (Living Force adventure)|''Destruction'']] {{Mo}}\n*''[[A Hero Seeks Not Vengeance]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Heart]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Hand (adventure)|The Hand]]''\n*''[[The Eye]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020307bshadows&c=swlfc|text=Life in the Shadows|int=Life in the Shadows|archivedate=20030813173510}} {{Po}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20020725cell|text=The Cell Revisited|int=The Cell Revisited|archivedate=20091016045153}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20030807darkstaff|text=The Darkstaff|int=The Darkstaff|archivedate=20091016035002}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lfinsider|text=Insider|int=Insider|archivedate=20090603045611}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Clone Wars Campaign Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Markus, Len}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Dark Jedi]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitive Believers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
