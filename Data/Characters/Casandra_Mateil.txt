Mateil was often considered to be somewhat egotistical; she would refuse to sign personal [[autoprint]]s, instead the autoprints would be created, and fans had to pay for them. She held second place at the [[Ahto City swoop track]] until Revan helped [[Queedle Molto]] enhance his [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] to become Sector Champion. Mateil's time fell to third place, and [[Hukta Jax]] was moved to second. Mateil was bumped down to fourth place once Revan became Sector Champion.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Casandra Mateil\n|nl=Casandra Mateil\n|pl=Casandra Mateil\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mateil, Cassandra}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Swoop racers]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
