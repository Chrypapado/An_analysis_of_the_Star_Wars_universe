He eventually amassed a large personal fortune and rose to power in the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]], where he won favor from [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] and was given the title of [[Imperial Advisor]]. In this capacity, Rodin spent his time handling sensitive situations for the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]], who he was totally loyal to.<ref name=\"MTL\" />\n\nSoon after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Verpalion was assigned as overseer of the [[NOVA]] project on [[Lianna/Legends|Lianna]]. Rodin strongly disliked what he considered \"backwater\" worlds such as Lianna and desired the refinement and style of the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core worlds]]. In order to make Verpalion stay as short as possible, [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Valles Santhe]] made Verpalion's living arrangements run counter to his taste, which forced him out after only a few days. He only returned to the planet periodically to check on the ongoing work. During a reception held in his honor, a team of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] operatives managed to steal a copy of the NOVA plans and sabotage the originals. When the device was finally tested during Verpalion's inspection, it failed to cloak the test ship, leaving Rodin furious and blaming [[Phillip Santhe]] for the failure.<ref name=\"MTL\" />\n\n[[File:NOVA_Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Phillip Santhe]] presenting the [[NOVA]] project to Lord Verpalion.]]\n\nAt the time of the Rebel Alliance's sabotage of the NOVA project, it was rumored on Lianna that Lord Verpalion and Lady Valles's granddaughter [[Miri Santhe]] were \"more than just friends\". However, this was not true.<ref name=\"MTL\" /> After the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Lord Verpalion petitioned the Empire to invade the planet, despite the neutral attitude of Valles Santhe; however, Lady Valles was able to keep Lianna neutral.<ref name=\"DESB\">''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nOutwardly, Verpalion appeared to be a friendly and generous man, however he was quite capable of ruthlessly torturing and killing for pleasure. He was a close friend of [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]] whose policies he admired. Rodin genuinely believed that the Empire was a force for good and that aliens, droids and other scum were inferior to [[Human/Legends|Humans]]. He considered himself a patron of the arts.<ref name=\"MTL\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mission to Lianna]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Far Orbit Project|story=The Capture of Coh Veshiv}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Verpalion, Rodin Hlian}}\n[[Category:Bureaucrats of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Senators]]\n[[Category:Lianns]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
