Let's see&hellip;How could I possibly describe him? The only word that immediately springs to mind is 'unique.'|Chden K'Reye|Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy}}\n'''Yin Vocta''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Anomid/Legends|Anomid]] businessman on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Lianna/Legends|Lianna]]. He was the enigmatic owner of [[Bantha Traxx]] and the long-term friend of [[Kaylo NaKuda]]. He was also a [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]].\n\n==Biography==\nYin Vocta graduated top of his class at the prestigious [[Lunis-Medix Medical Academy]]. He was a skilled surgeon who performed countless [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] enhancements on the [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]] [[Haelon Tice]]. He spent many years on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] but was never associated to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt's]] criminal organization. He eventually made his way to Lianna where his company, [[Vector Technologies]], sometimes called VecTech purchased the abandoned nightclub [[Club Vortex]] and completely refurbished it as Bantha Traxx. It was rumored that Yin had set up a secret deal with Lady [[Valles Santhe]] in order to acquire the property. Both VecTech and Bantha Traxx became very profitable. Yin actively sought out the best and brightest bands to play at his club, including [[BoSS Code]], [[Proton Overload]] and [[Dengar and the Destroyers]]. Up-and-coming bands would play at his annual 'Gathering of the Herd' event and was considered to be an opportunity for a band to get a big break.\n\n[[File:Yin_Vocta2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Yin Vocta with [[R'Kayza]] and [[Haelon Tice]]]]\nYin also ran a criminal empire and was not against assassination. He also had a rivalry with Jabba's organization and paid [[Divv]] for information all of Jabba's spies on Lianna. He then sent out his two assassins, Haelon Tice and [[R'Kayza]] to kill them all.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nYin was mysterious with being intimidating. He was polite, charming, and had a good sense of humor. He was also detested violence although he did carry weaponry for self-defense. Despite his social nature and non-violent attitude he had no qualms issuing orders to kill to his associates.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nYin was an expert surgeon who specialized in cybernetics. He was also a master at charm and negotiations and was a consummate host. He was also skilled in [[Anomid sign language/Legends|Anomid sign language]] and was knowledgeable with the languages, cultures and practices of numerous worlds. Finally he was quite skilled with his [[wrist vac]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYin Vocta was designed by [[Paul Danner]] and [[Bill Smith]] for ''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'', a supplement for the ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' that was published by [[West End Games]] in [[1997]]. He was illustrated by [[Brian Schomburg]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Yin Vocta#legends\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vocta, Yin}}\n[[Category:Anomids]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Lianns]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Medical professionals]]"}}}]}}}}
