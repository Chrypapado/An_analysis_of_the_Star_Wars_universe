As Barney and his best friend, [[Flint]], tried to casually spy on Skywalker, a trio of Imperial assassins attempted to eliminate the Rebel crew. The two friends watched as Skywalker's skills helped him easily eliminate the assassins. Barney and Flint then decided to help the Rebels fight the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] presence on Belderone. However, the Empire did not attack the Rebel base on the neighboring world of [[Kulthis]], as the Rebels had predicted. Instead, [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] ordered an AT-AT assault on Barney's home village on Belderone itself. As the Rebels signaled their allies to attack the AT-ATs, Flint and Barney jumped in a [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] and sped toward their home town town in hopes of warning the general populace, especially Flint's unaware [[Zana|mother]]. Unfortunately, Flint's piloting skills failed him and he crashed the craft just on the outskirts of the city, and Flint and Barney were both knocked unconscious.\n\n[[File:Barney.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Barney in 4 ABY]]\n\nAfter the crash Barney was badly injured, while Flint was recruited by the Empire. Recovering, Barney continued working with the [[Alliance of Free Planets]]. Luke Skywalker trained a number of recruits, giving them standard Rebel training on the forest moon of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]]. Many of the trainees, including Barney, wanted to be trained as [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] instead. Skywalker, however, refused to train them in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].\n\nBarney accompanied Skywalker and Organa on a mission to [[Naldar]], to free the people from the [[Dark Lord of Belderone]], who had [[Subjugation of Naldar|conquered]] Naldar. It was revealed that the Dark Lord was in fact Barney's old friend, Flint. With the help of Barney, Skywalker was able to turn Flint from the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark side of the Force]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars Annual (1977) 3|''Star Wars Annual'' (1977) 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 92|''Star Wars'' (1977) 92]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Barney\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Belderonians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
