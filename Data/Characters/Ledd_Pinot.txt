He was wanted by the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] for skimming profits in a smuggling operation. A [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] worth 4,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] dead or alive was placed on his head. This bounty was claimed by [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]] who also was looking for Bendix Fust.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLedd Pinot is the first, out of five bounties to encounter in the first Oovo IV level. It is unclear which way Jango Fett claimed the bounty as it is the same reward either way.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ledd Pinot#legends\n|es=Ledd Pinot\n|ja=\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d4\u30ce\u30c3\u30c8\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pinot, Ledd}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
