This is simply a matter of being true to the man you have always been.|Plo Koon, to Jace Dallin.|Republic 69}}\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] '''Jace Dallin''' was a career military man from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Rendili/Legends|Rendili]] with a deep love for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He served as an [[Aide/Legends|aide]] to [[Militarist/Legends|Militarist]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Ranulph Tarkin/Legends|Ranulph Tarkin]] and as second-in-command of Tarkin's military, the [[Republic Outland Regions Security Force]]. In [[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]], Dallin was pulled into the [[Stark Hyperspace War/Legends|Stark Hyperspace War]] when Tarkin decided to lead his [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] to a summit with the [[Stark Commercial Combine]], a gang of [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]]. The fleet was [[First Battle of Qotile|ambushed]] by [[Iaco Stark]]'s forces in an attempted power grab, and Dallin barely made it to the surface of the planet [[Troiken/Legends|Troiken]]. There, he joined forces with the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] delegation to Stark's summit and held out for several [[Standard day/Legends|days]] from the security of an abandoned [[Spice/Legends|spice]] [[Mining/Legends|mine]]. Dallin led Tarkin's [[Army/Legends|army]] against Stark's forces and developed a deep respect for the Jedi leader, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]]. During the [[Ground warfare|fighting]], Dallin received a wound to his face. Without access to [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]], the wound left a large, distinctive facial scar.\n\nDallin survived the war, joining the Republic's [[Judicial Forces/Legends|Judicial Forces]]. After that service, he returned to his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and entered the [[Rendili Home Defense Fleet]], where he rose to command the entire fleet. In the [[20 BBY/Legends|final year]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], [[Rendili/Legends|Rendili]] was taken by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], and Dallin faced the choice of following the orders of his homeworld's government, now a Separatist puppet, or defecting to the Republic he loved and against which he did not wish to fight. A delegation led by Koon arrived to negotiate with him&mdash;and if he would not surrender, to destroy Rendili's powerful fleet rather than let it fall into the hands of the enemy. When Dallin expressed his distaste for the [[Independent Provisional Government of Rendili]], he and Koon were taken hostage in a mutiny led by [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mellor Yago]]. A Jedi team stormed [[Mersel Kebir|Dallin's flagship]], freeing Dallin, who resumed command of the fleet and killed Yago in a [[Lightfight|gun battle]] on the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]]. Dallin joined the Republic, but his service was short-lived; shortly after the [[Declaration of a New Order]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] [[Emperor's purge|executed]] Dallin, ever loyal to the Jedi, for questioning the new [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor's]] word that the Jedi were traitors.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\n{{Quote|General Tarkin had been ''most'' explicit about [[Humanocentrism|wanting only ''Humans'']] in ''his'' army and many of us, I am ashamed to say, thought like him, myself included.|Jace Dallin.|Star Wars (1998) 38}}\n[[File:Dallin_Tarkin.jpg|thumb|left|215x215px|Dallin behind Ranulph Tarkin, whom he served as an aide]]\nA native of the [[Planet/Legends|world]] [[Rendili/Legends|Rendili]],<ref name=\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili 1\" /> the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Jace Dallin eventually found himself serving as an [[Aide/Legends|aide]] to [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Ranulph Tarkin/Legends|Ranulph Tarkin]] of [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]].<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 1\" /> The fiery leader of the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate's]] [[Militarist/Legends|militarist]] faction, Tarkin was committed to reestablishing the [[Republic Army]] and [[Republic Navy|Navy]].

Stark then sold this bacta at lower prices, earning a reputation as a hero throughout the Rim, despite his criminal activities. Seeking a resolution to the conflict, the Senate voted to hold a summit between the Trade Federation, Stark, and the Republic regarding the bacta shortage.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 1\" />\n\nHowever, Tarkin was determined that the crisis would be best solved by crushing Stark's pirates with military force. With Dallin at his side, he entered into an agreement with Representative [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]] of the Trade Federation; Gunray provided the location of the secret meeting, and Tarkin would arrive with the Outland Regions Security Force [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] to destroy Stark. It was Tarkin's intent to lead a smashing military success, proving the value of a standing Republic [[Army/Legends|army]] and [[Navy/Legends|navy]] and catapulting himself into the [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellorship]] upon returning as a hero.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 1\" />\n\n====A change of heart====\n{{Quote|You came with the Jedi, rallied our troops, and pushed them back.

Aboard the [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]] [[Invincible (Stark Hyperspace War)|''Invincible'']], Dallin awaited Gunray's signal that the conference on [[Troiken/Legends|Troiken]] was underway. With its receipt, the armada jumped into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]. Dallin and Tarkin were unaware, however, that Stark had anticipated the betrayal and used it to justify his power grab. A [[navcomputer virus]] was piggybacked on Gunray's signal while, at the summit, Stark attacked the delegates. The [[Navigation computer/Legends|navigation computers]] of Tarkin's fleet were scrambled, resulting in most of the fleet missing their destination. Dallin and the ''Invincible'' were among the one-third of the fleet that made it to Troiken, where they were badly outnumbered by Stark's own fleet.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 1\" /> The ''Invincible'' was heavily hammered by enemy [[Starship/Legends|ships]] as the fleet was [[First Battle of Qotile|decimated]]; Dallin looked to Tarkin for orders, but the Eriadu commander had frozen with uncertainty amidst this sudden upending of his plans. Senator [[Finis Valorum/Legends|Finis Valorum]], the Republic's delegate to the conference, had escaped with Gunray and their [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] escort, and he contacted Tarkin with instructions to land at [[Mount Avos]] and take shelter in an abandoned [[Spice/Legends|spice]] [[Mining/Legends|mine]] inside the [[Mountain/Legends|mountain]]. Tarkin angrily refused to take orders, but the ''Invincible'' was almost completely annihilated, and after a particularly damaging hit, he relented. Dallin issued the orders to evacuate the [[Troop/Legends|troops]] and defend their [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]]; Tarkin parroted those orders [[Standard second|seconds]] later. The two then escaped in a life pod shortly before the ''Invincible'' was destroyed.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 2\">[[Star Wars (1998) 37|''Star Wars'' (1998) 37]]</ref>\n\nDallin made planetfall on the [[Lycinder Plain]] in front of Avos, where the surviving army [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] fled, entered the mine and began fortifying it while under fire from Stark's forces. They were swiftly joined by Valorum, Gunray, and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]], [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]], and [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], as well as Jinn's [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] learner [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. [[Tyvokka/Legends|Tyvokka]], another Jedi Master, had died as a result of Stark's betrayal. After Valorum called out Tarkin for obliging Stark's trap with his secret fleet, Dallin took an active role in the mine's fortifications, inventorying the group's supplies and organizing the troops.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 3\" />\n\nKoon used his [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathic]] powers to read Stark's mind, and discovered that Stark and his confederates planned to launch a surprise attack on the mountain. Dallin and the Jedi prepared, and the [[Second Battle of Qotile|battle]] saw many [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] wounded, but it was a Republic victory as Dallin's troops used the high ground to fend off Stark's advances. Additionally, Koon's telepathy allowed him to know of any sorties and rally the Jedi against them. After the battle, Koon and the other Jedi visited the wounded&mdash;healing, comforting, and reassuring them. Seeing the [[Kel Dor/Legends|Kel Dor]] Jedi serve without ego and display genuine concern for the troops broke Dallin of his humanocentrism.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 3\" /> Additionally, Dallin was disillusioned with Tarkin after the Senator's failure under fire, his displays of egocentrism, his failure to treat his soldiers as more than tools for his own ends, and the defeatist attitude he was displaying at Avos. As such, Dallin's loyalty began to swing from Tarkin to the Jedi: Tarkin was largely ignored as Dallin began taking his orders from Koon, for whom he developed an immense personal respect.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 4\" /><ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 3\" />\n\n====Under siege====\n{{Quote|The troops on Troiken found life getting tougher. We were out of bacta, low on food, and running out of ammunition. Enemy troops, though, we had ''big time!'' Stark's forces found an entrance into the main cavern.

As it was, things were up for grabs&hellip;|Jace Dallin, reflecting on the final stages of the Stark Hyperspace War.|Star Wars (1998) 39}}\nAfter the battle, the Jedi developed a plan to sneak Valorum and Gunray back to the Republic's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world, [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], where Valorum would plead for reinforcements. With the Troiken group's communications [[Jammer|jammed]], they were assumed [[Death/Legends|dead]]. Dallin begged for Koon to stay, knowing that the troops looked up to him and depended on the Jedi Master for their morale. Koon agreed to stay while the other Jedi accompanied the [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomats]], and Dallin led a [[Third Battle of Qotile|diversionary battle]] while the other Jedi escaped from the caves. After aiding the others in acquiring a ship, Jinn and Kenobi returned to Avos, accompanied by [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Tholme/Legends|Tholme]] and his apprentice [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]], who had stowed away on a [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] that arrived on Troiken from Thyferra after conducting an [[Mission to Thyferra|investigation]] of the bacta crisis. Meanwhile, one of Dallin's patrols came across the [[Xexto/Legends|Xexto]] [[Billibango]], a native who wished to aid the Republic. He warned them of the threat of [[challat eater]]s in the mines&mdash;huge swarms of flesh-eating [[Insect/Legends|insects]].<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 3\" /> Just in [[Time/Legends|time]], the Jedi were able to bring down a section of the caves, trapping the newly awakened challat eaters.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 4\" />\n\n[[File:Dallin_with_Troops.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dallin leads his troops from Mount Avos.]]\nDue to another warning from Billibango, the Republic was made aware of an impending surprise attack by Stark's forces. Enemy troops surged into the caverns of Mount Avos, but Dallin's men rallied against them. During the [[Fourth Battle of Qotile|battle]], Dallin was wounded in an explosion; shielding from Billibango spared him from death. Dallin did, however, receive a large gash to the left side of his face. It was stitched up, but as the troops had no bacta, it healed into a large, distinguishing scar. After he awoke in the mine, Dallin spent the rest of the war with half of his face swaddled in bandages.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 4\" />\n\nKoon was able to make telepathic contact with the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] through his niece, [[Sha Koon]]. The Republic refused to send aid, but the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] worked out a plan. Jedi reinforcements arrived over Troiken soon after, leading a task force of Trade Federation ships co-opted by a promise not to reveal the Federation's role in fabricating the bacta crisis. Stark was telepathically offered amnesty by Koon in return for betraying his forces, which he did. Koon planned to harmlessly trap Stark's army by retreating though the caverns, then sealing the entrances explosively. Dallin commanded the evacuation, but on reaching the exit&mdash;the last opening to be sealed&mdash;he found that Tarkin had disappeared with the charge that was to have been used to seal the exit. Tarkin, furious that Koon had usurped his command, was determined to go out a hero. He used explosives to clear the cave-in that had trapped the challat eaters, unleashing them on Stark's troops, who were devoured alive. Koon was the last to emerge from the cave, and he sealed the exit behind him with a Force-triggered rockslide. Stark's forces were [[Fifth Battle of Qotile|defeated]], and Dallin joined his troops in celebrating the end of the [[Stark Hyperspace War/Legends|Stark Hyperspace War]].<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 4\" />\n\n===Life in peacetime===\n{{Quote|Sorry to interrupt, Masters, but I was hoping to see Master Plo Koon again.

By [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]], he was a crew member on the [[Consular-class cruiser|''Consular''-class cruiser]] [[Intrepid (Consular-class)|''Intrepid'']]. In that [[Standard year/Legends|year]], the ''Intrepid'' was called upon to carry a Jedi contingent including Masters [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]], Gallia, and Koon to [[Kiffex/Legends|Kiffex]], where they recovered the Jedi Padawan [[Aayla Secura/Legends|Aayla Secura]]. Dallin, ecstatic to have Koon aboard, went to see the Jedi Master during the return trip to Coruscant. With Koon were Windu, Gallia, Tholme, and Secura. Secura stared at Dallin's scars, unusual in a [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] with access to bacta, and he described them as \"battle flags\" from the war. Secura had had her memory erased during a failed mission, and so the group recounted the events of the war to her. At the end of the reunion, Dallin expressed his intense gratitude to Koon for the Jedi Master's service in the war, to which Dallin felt he owed his life.<ref name=\"The Stark Hyperspace War 1\" />\n\nDallin eventually retired from service to the Republic, returning to his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of Rendili. There, he joined and became the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] of the [[Rendili Home Defense Fleet]].

Koon, now a [[High Jedi General/Legends|High Jedi General]] in the war, and Captain [[Jan Dodonna/Legends|Jan Dodonna]], a rising naval star and fellow veteran of the Stark Hyperspace War, traveled to the ''Mersel Kebir'', seeking Dallin's defection and that of Rendili's powerful Home Defense Fleet. High [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] [[Saesee Tiin/Legends|Saesee Tiin]] commanded a task force of three [[Acclamator-class assault ship|''Acclamator''-class assault ships]] which would, if negotiations failed, [[Space warfare|engage]] Rendili's fleet.<ref name=\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili 1\" />\n\nKoon and Dodonna came aboard, and Dallin confessed his confusion to them; Koon told him that his greater loyalty must lie with the Republic. He was interrupted by the ambitious [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Mellor Yago]], however, who insisted that orders be obeyed. Dallin rebuked the junior officer, telling him that Rendili had been taken by force and that the Independent Provisional Government was merely a mouthpiece for the Separatists. Accusing Dallin of [[Treason/Legends|treason]], Yago drew his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and, backed by several other junior officers, placed Dallin under arrest and took command of the fleet. With a knife to his neck and a blaster to his head, Dallin ordered Koon to disregard Dallin's own life and put down the mutiny. Koon refused, claiming there would be another time. Dallin, all other Home Defense Fleet senior officers, and the Republic emissaries were taken to the [[Prison/Legends|brig]].<ref name=\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili 1\" />\n\nYago secretly called for Separatist reinforcements while attempting to use his captives as hostages and force a Republic withdrawal.

Dallin was a recurring supporting character in ''Republic'', appearing again in [[Star Wars: Republic: Dreadnaughts of Rendili|''The Dreadnaughts of Rendili'']] and [[Republic 78|''Loyalties'']], both written by Ostrander. Dallin was never illustrated twice by the same artist, however, with [[Jan Duursema]] illustrating him for ''The Dreadnaughts of Rendili'' and [[Luke Ross]] doing so in ''Loyalties''.\n\nAlthough Dallin's [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] are consistently [[Color/Legends|colored]] blue throughout the [[Star Wars (1998) 36|first]] [[Star Wars (1998) 37|three]] [[Star Wars (1998) 38|issues]] of ''The Stark Hyperspace War'', the [[Star Wars (1998) 39|fourth and final issue]] colors them brown, a coloring that would be used for all of Dallin's later appearances. This article treats brown as the [[canon]]ical color.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 36|''Star Wars'' (1998) 36]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 37|''Star Wars'' (1998) 37]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 38|''Star Wars'' (1998) 38]]\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 39|''Star Wars'' (1998) 39]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Republic: Dreadnaughts of Rendili]]''\n*[[Republic 78|''Republic'' 78]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|123|KOO2, ''Plo Koon''}} {{Po}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jace Dallin#legends\n|es=Jace Dallin\n|pl=Jace Dallin\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u0441 \u0414\u044d\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dallin, Jace}}\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Judicial Forces officers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Personnel of Ranulph Tarkin's paramilitary]]\n[[Category:Rendili residents]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy captains]]\n[[Category:Separatist officers]]"}}}]}}}}
