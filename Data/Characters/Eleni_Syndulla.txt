The [[Marriage|wife]] of the freedom fighter [[Cham Syndulla]], she had a daughter, [[Hera Syndulla|Hera]], with him. During the [[Clone Wars]], Eleni hid herself and her daughter underground to stay safe amidst the [[Battle of Ryloth|battle]] between the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and the [[Separatist Droid Army]], but she also joined her husband's [[Twi'lek Resistance|resistance movement]] and fought in the battle. Later, she was [[Death|killed]] in Cham's [[Free Ryloth Movement|new resistance]] against the [[Galactic Empire]], a loss which drove her husband to become obsessed with protecting Ryloth and created a rift between him and their daughter.\n\nIn [[2 BBY]], when [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn's]] forces set up headquarters in the [[Syndulla residence]] as part of the Imperial [[Ryloth Insurgency#The rebellion|occupation]] of [[Tann Province]], Hera attempted to recover her mother's [[Kalikori]], a precious Twi'lek heirloom, from her home. Although she was unsuccessful and the Kalikori was taken by Thrawn, Hera accepted that she did not need it to keep her [[Parent|mother's]] memory alive as long as she held onto her father and the members of [[Spectres|her crew]] who had become like family.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life to Imperial Era===\n{{Quote|I was a little girl when the Clone War came to Ryloth.

Seeing the ships inspired Hera to become a [[pilot]].<ref name=\"Wings of the Master\" /> Eleni joined the [[Twi'lek Resistance]], fighting alongside her husband to ensure their world became free.<ref name=\"Eleni databank\" />\n\nAfter the Clone Wars had ended, Eleni and Cham initially cooperated with the new [[Galactic Empire]], as Cham was tired of war and did not want the same life for his daughter. Eleni, however, quickly grew suspicious of the Empire's motives, noticing that they were taking away control of Ryloth from the Twi'leks and putting it in the hands of their own people. Shortly after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the Empire<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" /> in [[19 BBY]],<ref name=\"SWGA\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> Eleni, Cham, and [[Senator]] [[Orn Free Taa]] were present in the [[capital]] [[city]] of [[Lessu]], where an uneasy crowd waited to hear the unpopular senator speak. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Rampart]] noted that the Empire was displeased by the Twi'leks being troubled by the Imperial presence, as their new [[Imperial doonium refinery|refinery]] would bring jobs to the citizens. Taa claimed that the Syndullas welcomed the partnership, asking Eleni if she agreed. Eleni responded that she would support whatever helped Ryloth.<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" />\n\nTaa was booed by the crowd when he spoke about cooperation with the Empire, as the people demanded to hear Cham. The general moved to speak, with Eleni and [[Clone Captain]] [[Howzer]] standing nearby. Cham said that he trusted the clone army and asked his people to lay down their weapons so they could look to Ryloth's future, receiving cheers from most of the crowd, to the distress of Senator Taa. After the crowd began dispersing, [[Admiral]] Rampart told Eleni that it was a shame her daughter had not been there to share in the event. Unnerved, Eleni stated that Hera had other interests, looking uncomfortable as the [[Imperial officer]] walked away.<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" />\n\nLater, at the [[Syndulla residence]], Eleni and [[Gobi Glie]] watched while Cham oversaw Twi'leks turning in their weapons. Glie, a long-time [[lieutenant]] of Cham's, was disturbed that he was okay with letting clones protect Ryloth. Eleni noted that her husband knew the people were tired of fighting and that they could not go on as they had been. Disagreeing, Glie argued that the disarmament had made them defenceless, and he had already reached out to a [[Cid|contact]] to acquire more. Just then, Howzer arrived with a [[squad]] of clones, escorting Hera and her [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]]. Howzer told Cham the two had been caught trespassing in a restricted area, and that he would not report them but that such an incident could not happen again. Glie admitted to Cham that he had sent Hera, and as the two men argued, Eleni escorted Hera and Chopper inside the house. Eleni told her daughter that she was aware she had been at the Imperial [[refinery]], responding to the girl's surprise by explaining that she had her ways and telling her to report and leave nothing out.<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" />\n\nLater, Eleni and Cham were given a tour of the refinery by Rampart, who insisted that the [[doonium]] [[Mining|mine]] would only benefit their planet. Noting the facility's [[turbolaser]]s, Eleni pointed out that, contrary to the Empire's claims, it appeared to be a military facility, as there were also [[soldier]]s stationed there. Rampart countered that Ryloth had been vulnerable under the Republic, but it would not be under the Empire. After the Admiral excused himself, Eleni argued with Cham about whether they were truly getting the peace they wanted.<ref name=\"Devil's Deal\" /> After her and Cham found out that Hera, along with Gobi Glie and [[Serin]] had been captured by the empire, they launched a rescue attempt, which had short lived success, as they did free the prisoners, however Eleni, along with the rest of the rebels besides Hera were captured by the Empire.\n\nEleni and the other rebels were brought back to Lessu and placed in prison cells. After Hera managed to escape the Empire, she began spying on Lessu. She then overheard that the Empire was sending an elite squad to hunt her down. With this realization, she made contact with [[Clone Force 99]] and requested their help. While they were hesitant, [[Omega]] convinced them to help. After causing a distraction at the refinery, [[Hunter]] and [[Echo]] were able to break into the prison and rescue the Syndullas and their supporters and are able to escape the planet with the help of Howzer. Once back at their ship Eleni offered the Batch credits. However, they refused, saying that they will need them to continue their fight against the Empire.\n\nEleni survived the Clone Wars and joined her husband in [[Free Ryloth Movement|resisting]] against the [[Galactic Empire]] that entrenched themselves on Ryloth after the fall of the [[Galactic Republic]]. During this resistance movement, she was killed by the Imperial forces that invaded their [[homeworld]].<ref name=\"Cham Syndulla DB\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Hera would have inherited our family's Kalikori.''\"<br />\"''And I still will.
