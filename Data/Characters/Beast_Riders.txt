But eventually, the outlaws learned to tame the flying beasts.|[[Arca Jeth]]|audio=BeastRiders-TOTJ.ogg|Tales of the Jedi (audio)}}\n[[File:BeastRiders-GAW.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Beast Rider army in flight]]\n\nThe rulers had hoped the dissidents, branded \"criminals,\" would be devoured by the vicious beasts in the Onderon wilderness that had migrated over an oxygen bridge from the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]]. However, the rulers were proven wrong. Over time, the outcasts succeeded in taming the beasts, using them as winged war mounts for their campaigns against the walled city of the Iziz army. They managed to establish themselves as powerful Warlords, with great armies of vicious creatures at their command known as the [[Drexl]]. The [[Beast-Lord]] [[Kinch Sunka]] led the first attack on [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of Onderon,<ref name=\"GAW\">''[[Galaxy at War]]''</ref> leading the planet into a permanent war.\n\n===Beast Wars===\nThe conflict between the corrupt monarchy and the Beast Riders escalated to the point that Queen [[Amanoa]] sought aid from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]]'s students, [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], [[Cay Qel-Droma]], and [[Tott Doneeta]], were sent to deal with the situation. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] learned that the queen's daughter, Princess [[Galia]], had been kidnapped by the beast riders. Upon finding her, they learned the captivity was a ruse intended to hide Galia's true intentions: escape from the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]-influenced royalty and marriage to the [[Beast-Lord]], [[Oron Kira]].\n\nQueen Amanoa would not stand for any such marriage and attacked the Jedi with her dark side powers. Simultaneously, the Beast Riders attacked and took Iziz. Amanoa was defeated and Galia married Oron Kira. Their marriage ended the war between the city-dwellers and Beast Riders, finally granting a tenuous peace for Onderon.\n\n===Other Battles===\nThe Beast Riders would fight once again&mdash;in defense of Onderon&mdash;during the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]] against the allied forces of [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] and the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]]. They successfully drove the Mandalorians to [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], where [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore]] was killed by native wildlife. The Beast Riders also fought during the [[Mandalorian Wars]], in which Onderon was one the first [[Planet/Legends|planets]] to fall to the Mandalorian warriors.\n\n[[File:BeastRiders2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Beast Riders in action.]]\n\nMany Beast Riders perished in the liberation of Onderon, and most survivors ended up in Iziz seeking employment as [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]]. Many, however, became mere street thugs and criminals. Some of these included [[Bakkel]] and [[Panar]], whom the [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]] encountered while seeking [[holodisc]]s for [[Dhagon Ghent]] so she could meet with [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kavar]] in the [[Iziz Royal Palace]].\n\nIt is unknown which side the Beast Riders took in the [[Onderon Civil War]], but it is assumed they were divided over the issue. Their beasts, on the other hand, aided the [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]]'s Confederates and [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] allies due to the Sith practicing a ritual in Freedon Nadd's tomb to control the beasts. It is believed that they largely sided with the Royalist supporters of Queen [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]].\n\nFollowing the war, the Beast Riders faded into history, but a number were still present when [[Leia Organa Solo]] fled from the reborn [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] to Onderon.\n\nOnderonians continued to practice beast riding long after the original Beast Riders became scarce.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (miniseries)|''Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi (audio)]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Freedon Nadd Uprising]]''\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)]]''\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 6|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 6]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War 6|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War'' 6]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 48|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 48]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Mo}} {{Codex}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught]]'' {{Mo}} {{Codex}}\n*''[[Bane of the Sith]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Darth Bane: Rule of Two]]''\n*[[Darth Bane: Rule of Two (audiobook)|''Darth Bane: Rule of Two'' audiobook]]\n*{{FFG|book=Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Beginner Game|text=''Star Wars: Age of Rebellion'' Beginner Game|story=Takeover at Whisper Base (Adventure Book)|stext=Takeover at Whisper Base}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Operation: Shadowpoint]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|26|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 1}}\n*{{InsiderCite|27|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 2}}\n*{{InsiderCite|28|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 3}}\n*''[[Tales of the Jedi Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galaxy at War]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|150|Legendary Authors|Authors of the Expanded Universe: Twenty Years of Tales of the Jedi}}\n*[[Stay on Target (sourcebook)|''Stay on Target'']]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bestienreiter\n|es=Jinete de Bestias\n|ru=\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Beast Riders| ]]\n[[Category:Culture of Onderon]]\n[[Category:Military units]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
