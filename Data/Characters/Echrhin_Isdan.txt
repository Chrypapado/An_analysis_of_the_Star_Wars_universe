When the spacer returned, Isdan gave him a [[Mystical stone|mystical glowing stone]] that would teleport the spacer from anywhere in the caverns back to [[Kachirho/Legends|Kachirho]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEchrhin Isdan was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in [[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees|Rage of the Wookiees]], the second addon to [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment's]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011. He could be found in the Myyydril village in the Myyydril Caverns, where players could talk to him to start a simple quest. The player had to go outside the caverns and search for stones in the area around the cavern entrance. The reward for the quest was a mystical stone that could be used in the caves to teleport back to [[Kachirho/Legends|Kachirho]]. It spared players the long way back through the caves and Kkowir Forest area, where vehicles could not be used.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Rage of the Wookiees}} {{1st}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Isdan, Echrhin}}\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tulgah]]"}}}]}}}}
