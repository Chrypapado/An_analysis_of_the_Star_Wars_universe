Thank! Thank you very much. I can use this design as the beginnings of my own business. Thank you!|Shobbo Durron, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nSometime following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], she designed a power cell that was efficient and cheaper to manufacture than those on the market. However, [[Kazic Pendre]], owner of the company [[Pendretronics]], took her design notes and schematic, leaving her with nothing. In light of this, she tasked a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] with securing her intellectual property, so that she could use it to start her own business. The spacer entered the Pendretronics headquarters and sliced Kazic Pendre's data terminal, successfully recovered the data, and brought it bach to Shobbo Durron.<ref name=\"SWG:TSPCS\" /> Around the same time, Kazic Pendre was killed by the [[Corellian Security Force]] after it was established that the businessman was also a member of the criminal organization known as the [[Chirq Council]].<ref name=\"SWG:TCCAI\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: Assumed Identity|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nShobbo Durron was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TSPCS\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Stolen Power Cell Schematic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Durron, Shobbo}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Engineers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
