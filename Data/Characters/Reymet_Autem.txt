Reckless by nature, he loved to participate in daredevil [[swoop-bike]] racing through [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant's]] garbage pits. Like his father, Reymet enrolled at the [[Guards' Academy]] due to his family's connection to the [[Senate Guard/Legends|Senate Guard]], but he did not like it.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Are you a friend of Ferus Olin?\"<br />\"We're best friends ... Hey, are you his parents? You look like you could be.\"<br />\"Yes, we're his parents ... Have you seen him this afternoon?\"<br />\"No, and that's weird, because he's in three of my classes...\"<br />\"Ferus told us that you know secret things about the school.\"<br />\"I know some things ... Follow me.|Jedi Masters [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] meet [[Leadership School]] tech prodigy Reymet Autem.|Jedi Quest: The School of Fear}}\nReymet Autem attended the [[Leadership School]] on [[Andara/Legends|Andara]], where he met [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] undercover \"transfer students\" [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ferus Olin]] in [[25 BBY/Legends|25 BBY]]. A computer, tech, and security systems genius who loved to play practical jokes, Reymet assisted them with the [[Mission to Andara|investigation]] of the son of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Berm Tarturi]], [[Gillam Tarturi]], who was allegedly kidnapped, but who had set up his own father for his staged murder, to avenge himself of him.<ref>''[[Jedi Quest: The School of Fear]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[26 BBY/Legends|26 BBY]], Reymet was hired at the Staff College on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Andara/Legends|Andara]], where he met [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ferus Olin]] who were there to conduct research. Reymet became an expert when he manipulated the technical institutes' systems, which were being tested by Ferus.\n\nIn the Guards' Academy, Reymet was a loner and had no friends, which he disclosed to Anakin Skywalker. After the disappearance of Ferus Olin, Reymet guided [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]] to the Academy's ancient tunnels, from which they rescued Ferus.\n\nIn [[23 BBY/Legends|23 BBY]], Reymet (having been suspended from the Academy) unknowingly helped his uncle [[Venco Autem|Venco]] attempt to carry out his assassination attempt on [[Simon Greyshade/Legends|Simon Greyshade]]. Already planning to go off-world with his girlfriend, [[Riao Siao]], Reymet fled, helped by his father, who distracted the other Senate Guards long enough for Reymet to flee arrest.\n\n[[File:Evan_Hessler.png|thumb|left|250px|Reymet in his guise of bounty hunter Evan Hessler]]\nReymet was soon followed by his mother [[Sula Autem|Sula]] and sister [[Lissa Autem|Lissa]], who had decided to leave Sagoro. In the years that followed, Reymet became a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] and [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]], one of his aliases being [[Evan Hessler]].\n\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], he was arrested for stealing a speeder belonging to [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Simon Greyshade/Legends|Simon Greyshade]], after it was \"borrowed\" by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]].\n\nHowever, after the war and the creation of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Reymet made an effort to find his father. Sagoro's name had appeared on a list of potential seditionists, and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] personally saw to capturing Autem. Under the guise of [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Evan Hessler]], Reymet succeeded in \"capturing\" his father, having thwarted [[Tartuta]] and [[Severian]]. Upon revealing his true identity, Reymet and his father fled [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to meet the rest of their awaiting family.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nReymet's appearance changes in his two comic appearances; in the first, he has black hair and brown eyes, and in the second, brown hair and green eyes.
