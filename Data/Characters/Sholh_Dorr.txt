He was a neighbor and friend of [[Cliegg Lars/Legends|Cliegg Lars]], and was crippled by [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] when he assisted Lars in searching for his missing wife [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|Shmi]]. Late in his life, Dorr bought the abandoned [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] droid [[3B6-RA-7]]. When the destruction of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]] made the droid a collectors item by destroying the majority of the rest of the [[RA-7 protocol droid/Legends|RA-7]] line, Dorr sold the droid at [[Eport]] for over a thousand times what he had paid for it.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'' novelization]]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (unabridged audiobook)|''Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones'' unabridged audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|28|LAR1-3, ''Owen and Beru Lars''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|droid|threeb6ra7|3B6-RA-7|archivedate=20110906101309}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sholh Dorr\n|ru=\u0428\u043e\u043b\u0445 \u0414\u043e\u0440\u0440\n|fi=Sholh Dorr\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dorr, Sholh}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
