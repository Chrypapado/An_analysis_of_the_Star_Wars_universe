I just happen to know a little more about human nature than you do. Human ''and'' nonhuman nature.|Maris Ferasi and Dubrak Qennto|Outbound Flight (novel)}}\n'''Dubrak \"Rak\" Qennto''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], and the [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] vessel ''[[Bargain Hunter]]''. With a crew of two&mdash;[[Jorj Car'das]] and [[Maris Ferasi]]&mdash;he ran cargo shipments such as [[firegem]]s and furs across the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]]. While evading [[Progga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] during one such trip, the crew became one of the first few (other than the Sith) outsiders to encounter the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] and [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]]. \"Rak,\" as he was called by the crew (mostly by his girlfriend and co-pilot Ferasi), chose to try to finagle his way out of their situation, rather than take advantage of it as Car'das and Maris did. He did not trust Commander Thrawn, and tried to convince both of his crewmates to do the same. Eventually, Thrawn released the smugglers.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dubrak Quennto#legends\n|hu=Dubrak Qennto\n|ru=\u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043a \u041a\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0442\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qennto, Dubrak}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
