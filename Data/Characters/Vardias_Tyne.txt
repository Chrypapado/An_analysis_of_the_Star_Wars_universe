While there, he faced trouble with the [[Dim-U]] monks, after having killed a [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] that was destroying his [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|vaporators]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|All I did was shoot a rogue bantha that was destroying my vaporators. Those blasted monks worship banthas. I didn't do anything different from anyone else in my position.|Vardias Tyne|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring [[1 ABY/Legends|1.5 ABY]], Vardias Tyne resided in the [[City/Legends|town]] of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. While here, he ended up killing a [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] that was destroying his [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|vaporators]]. Unfortunately for Vardias, the bantha-worshipping [[Dim-U]] monks learned of this, and sent a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named [[Rhalia Jinsari]] to kill Vardias Tyne.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nIn need of help, Vardias encountered a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] passing through Anchorhead. After explaining his plight, the spacer agreed to hunt down and kill the bounty hunter, who was just approaching town. Fortunately for Vardias, the spacer succeeded in killing the bounty hunter.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n[[File:BanthaStatue.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The small [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] statue, given to [[Chonar|Brother Chonar]] as a gift for forgiveness.]]\nHowever, Vardias knew his troubles were not yet over. He knew that the Dim-U would simply send another bounty hunter when they learned of Jinsari's demise. In order to calm down the Dim-U, Vardias had a talented [[Artist/Legends|artist]] sculpt a bantha statue out of a piece of [[kiliad marble]]. He tasked the spacer who had helped him earlier with deliving the bantha statue to Brother [[Chonar]], with the hope that they would forgive and forget the killing of the bantha. The spacer agreed, and sought out to find Chonar who was just outside of Anchorhead. When Chonar received the statue, he told the spacer that the statue conveyed the respect for the majestic bathas. He informed the spacer that the Dim-U would no longer pursue Vardias Tyne. When the spacer informed Vardias of the news, he thanked the spacer and gave away his [[Shellfish/Legends|shellfish]] [[Harvester|harvesting tool]] which he used to use in the [[river]]s of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. He admitted that it had little use on Tatooine, but that the spacer may have a use for it.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVardias Tyne was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. Players who performed a series of [[:w:c:swg:Quest|quests]] for Vardias in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] had to hunt down and kill [[Rhalia Jinsari]] outside the [[City/Legends|town]], and then deliver a [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] statue to [[Chonar]].
