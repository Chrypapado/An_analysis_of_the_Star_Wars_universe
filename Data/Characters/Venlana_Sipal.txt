An underboss for the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium]], she was stationed in [[Taleucema]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nDescended from the [[Pantoran/Legends|Pantorans]] that first colonized [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]], Venlana Sipal was born and raised on the dim, arid world during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Entering employment of the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium]] as an underboss, Sipal began to notice shipping losses that exceeded projections during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Suspecting [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] activity, Sipal sought to contract an individual as part of a loss prevention program to hunt down the pirate and recover the stolen cargo. Arranging to meet an interested party at the [[Paradise (Saleucami)|Paradise cantina]], Sipal and her personal assistant [[Porel]] explain that a pirate organization known as the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority]] is behind the attacks. Issuing a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on the so-called Queen who leads the Sorority, Sipal ensures the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] that a significant reward awaits them should they be successful.\n\nWhen the bounty hunter captures a body double of the Queen, Sipal asks that they redouble their efforts to locate the true Queen and stop further attacks on the Consortium's shipping business.\n\nShe eventually betrayed the Consortium and worked secretely for the Veiled Sorority.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAmbitious and merciless, Venlana Sipal wore a mask of polite professionalism at all times to disguise her true, more sinister nature. Dressing in conservative suits, she carried a [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]] as well as a [[vibroknife]] for her personal safety. Her melodic voice carried with it an air of confidence and authority.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Mask of the Pirate Queen]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sipal, Venlana}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Pantorans]]\n[[Category:Saleucamians]]\n[[Category:Veiled Sorority members]]\n[[Category:Zann Consortium members]]"}}}]}}}}
