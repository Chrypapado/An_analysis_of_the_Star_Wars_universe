He was a [[Currency|moneylender]] and would often use rough tactics to get his payments back.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Pintu_arrives.png|left|thumb|317x317px|Son-El entered Trace's repair shop to collect his money.]]\nBy [[19 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date note\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' establishes the [[trial of Ahsoka Tano]] and [[Order 66]] both occurred in [[19 BBY]]. As \"[[Gone with a Trace]]\" takes place between these events, the events of the episode must occur in 19 BBY.</ref> Pintu had lent [[Currency|money]] to [[Rafa Martez]]. The young [[Gender|woman]] had failed to pay back the sum on [[time]] however, so Pintu took two of his [[Pintu's henchmen|henchmen]] and headed to the [[Trace Martez's repair shop|repair shop]] of her sister, [[Trace Martez]]. Pintu demanded to know where his money was when he entered the shop. The surprised Trace tried to make excuses. Pintu saw through her bluff and set his henchmen on her and a fight broke out. Trace was almost beaten senseless when [[Ahsoka Tano]] joined the fight and easily defeated the henchmen. Pintu was surprised and ran with his men out of the shop, while reminding Martez that her sister's debts were far from being paid. Rafa later paid off her debt to Son-El with [[credit]]s she had gotten from the [[Twi'lek]] [[Lokann]] for building some [[binary loadlifter]] [[droid]]s.<ref name=\"Gone with a Trace\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Okami!
