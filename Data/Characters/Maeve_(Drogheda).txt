She was the founder of the [[Pius Dea]] religion and a devotee of [[Onrai]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Kymoodon Era]], the planet Drogheda was ruled by the [[Monarchy/Legends|monarch]] Maeve, who founded the [[Pius Dea]] religion as an offshoot of the [[Vianism|Vianist movement]]. Under the title of [[Malikha]], Maeve received the sacred creeds of the Pius Dea directly from [[the Goddess]] and formed the state religion around the precepts. When the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] invaded Drogheda and imprisoned Queen Maeve after she was betrayed by a member of her court. While Maeve could not be broken by the Hutts, they defiled her, tortured her, and killed her husband and mother.<ref name=\"CE\" />\n\nRescued from captivity when the Hutts were driven offworld, Maeve reemerged as the Warrior-Queen Malikha of Drogheda and leader of the Pius Dea. Taking on many husbands and raising many sons, Maeve sent her family out into the galaxy to spread the faith and incorporated the traditions of many neighboring worlds into the worship of the Goddess. Writing sacred tomes and distributing them across the region, Maeve called for a holy war to eradicate those irredeemable infidels, including races such as the Hutts. Overtime, the Pius Dea religion had spread across the galaxy and came to in short order be the state religion of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] itself.<ref name=\"CE\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cult Encounters of the Star Wars Universe]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Drogheda residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Pius Dea]]"}}}]}}}}
