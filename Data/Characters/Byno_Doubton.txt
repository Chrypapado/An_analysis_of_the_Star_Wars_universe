During the [[Clone Wars]], [[Gender|he]] produced at least two [[propaganda]] pieces for the Republic's unity communications campaign, the first of which was a [[Painting|poster]] titled \"[[Jedi Unite for Peace]]\" that never saw distribution due to the suggestion by [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] that the [[Jedi Order]] not be used in propaganda due to the [[Jedi]]'s discomfort at taking on the role of [[Republic Military|military]] [[Jedi General|leaders]] in the war.<ref name=\"Propaganda\" />\n\nHis second piece was entitled \"[[Unite]],\" and as part of a collaboration between COMPOR and the [[Republic War Office]], replaced the Jedi with the [[clone trooper]]s of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] in order to bolster moral. Following the Republic's [[Proclamation of the New Order|reformation]] into the [[Galactic Empire]] at the end of the war, Doubton became an instructor in the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]]'s [[Sub-Adult Group]] and eventually retired to his [[Doubton family estate|family estate]] back on Eriadu.<ref name=\"Propaganda\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nByno Doubton was first mentioned in the reference book ''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]'', which was written by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] and released on [[October 25]], [[2016]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Byno Doubton#kanon\n|fr=Byno Doubton\n|ru=\u0411\u0438\u043d\u043e \u0414\u043e\u0443\u0431\u0442\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doubton, Byno}}\n[[Category:Commission for the Preservation of the New Order personnel]]\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Propagandists]]"}}}]}}}}
