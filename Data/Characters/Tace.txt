Traveling in style with Princess Leia and all you do is complain.|Tace had a deep bond with her sister Tula|Princess Leia 3}}\n'''Tace''' was a [[Gender|female]] [[human]] musician who was a member of the [[Melodic Order]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. She was also sister to [[Tula]], an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] officer. Following the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]], Tace and her fellow musicians were rescued by [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]], who undertook a [[mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan]].\n\nTace was manipulated by Tula, who was under Imperial duress, into spying on Princess Leia's whereabouts. Tace was accused of being an Imperial spy but was cleared by Princess Leia, who identified Tula as the real spy. Princess Leia subsequently rescued Tula. Though Tace was initially angry at her sister for serving the Empire, the two sisters subsequently reconciled.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Melodic_Order_performing.png|thumb|left|250px|Tace and her fellow Melodic Order members performing on Naboo]]\n===Melodic Order===\nTace was a member of the [[Melodic Order]], a group of [[Alderaanian]] [[musician]]s that took a cloister vow not to play in person so that their music would not be polluted by outsiders. While the group traveled around [[the galaxy]] performing, they only played to crowds via [[hologram]] to honor their cloister vow. The band's leader was [[Uwa Pareece]], who managed the band's performances. Tace had a sister named [[Tula]], who was an [[Imperial officer]].<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\n===Escaping Naboo===\n{{Quote|Tula, I have to mourn with you.

Following the [[Battle of Yavin]], Tace asked her manager Pareece is she could send a hologram to her sister on Alderaan to make sure she was alright. However, Pareece, who was still unable to break the truth about Alderaan's destruction to the Melodic Order, asked if she had completely mastered the new [[Ruuscan song]]. Since Tace had not mastered the song, she told Tace to talk to her when she had before leaving.<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\nAfter [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and the Alderaanian [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] rescued the group from the trafficker [[Mul Sanaka]] and his [[Besalisk]] henchmen, Pareece broke the truth of Alderaan's destruction to Tace and the other musicians. The Alderaanian expatriates then escaped aboard the luxury yacht ''[[Lord Junn]]''. During the journey, Tace managed to correspond with her sister Tula by [[computer]].<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\nTace told Tula that she wanted to leave the Melodic Order but Tula told her to continue serving Princess Leia. When Tace told Tula that she missed her, Tula told her to stay in touch and call her every night. Tula requested information about her sister's whereabouts, activities, and the Princess's plans. Unaware that Tula was acting under duress from her Imperial [[Commander]] [[Dreed]],<ref name=\"Leia 3\">[[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]]</ref> Tace promised to contact her sister.<ref name=\"Leia 2\" />\n\n===Accused of spying===\n{{Quote|Remove her restraints at once.''\"<br>\"''Ma'am, this snippy little thing deserves no consideration.

Tula teased her by telling her that she should be grateful that she was serving Princess Leia. Tula promised to rejoin her sister. When Tace said she was alone, Tula reassured her they were able to keep in touch and told her to call back tomorrow. Acting on Tace's information, Commander Dreed attacked the [[Alderaan Enclave]] on Sullust with a platoon of [[stormtrooper]]s. However, the Enclave managed to escape with the help of Leia and Verlaine. As a result, Leia realized that they had a [[spy]] in their midst.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\nUsing their [[Eyewell]] to track the ''Lord Junn''{{'s}} signals, the Alderaan Enclave members [[Jora Astane]] and [[Covis]] brought a bound and tearful Tace to Princess Leia, accusing her of spying for the Empire. Believing that Tace was innocent until proven guilty, Princess Leia ordered Jorato remove her restraints and to leave them alone. When they were alone, Leia served Tace [[tea]] but Tace was reluctant to drink it since she believed that she should be serving her Princess instead.<ref name=\"Leia 4\">[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]]</ref>\n\nWhen Leia pressed Tace to reveal who the calls were from, Tace revealed that the calls were from her sister Tula. When Leia asked where Tula was, Tace replied that she was not sure because her sister was evasive about her whereabouts. Leia then asked Tace what she talked about with her sister. Tace told her that he sister asked about her ship and was interested in Princess Leia's whereabouts and adventure. Leia deduced that those calls originated from an Imperial ship and realized that the Imperial attack on Sullust was no coincidence. Tace confirmed that Tula was not an impostor and the two concluded that Tula was acting under duress.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\n===The moment of truth===\n{{Quote|When Tula calls tonight, I want you to act naturally. We'll talk about what you should say.

Though Tace thought it was impossible to free her sister, Leia reassured her that she had once been the [[Galactic Empire]]'s prisoner. She instructed Tace to lie to her sister when she called that night.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nThat night, Tace contacted Tula while Princess Leia observed the conversation. Tace told her sister that they only talked about her and asked Tula about her whereabouts. Tula sensed her sister's voice sounded strange. When Tula apologized for getting her sister into trouble, Tace demanded to know what she meant. However, Tula's controller Commander Dreed realized that the rebels were onto her and ordered his stormtroopers to lock Tula out.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nDreed then tormented Tace about the trouble she had cause Tula. Blaming herself for causing her sister's impending execution, Tace burst into tears. At that point, Leia intervened and offered to trade her freedom for Tula's life. As planned, Leia met with Commander Dreed on the desert world of [[Skaradosh]] and surrendered herself to the Empire in return for securing Tula's freedom.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" /> Unknown to Tace and Dreed, Leia and Verlaine had a plan to bait the Imperials and escape.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\n===Reunion with Tula===\n{{Quote|Your hair...!''\"<br>\"''I don't want to be confused for you.

Leia, her entourage, and Tula then escaped aboard the ''Mellcrawler'' and joined the ''Lord Junn'' and the rest of the Alderaanian refugee fleet above Espirion. In Tula's absence, Tace had shaved her hair. When Tula greeted her sister, a distraught Tace said that she did not want to be confused with her sister and that she did not want anyone thinking that she was a traitor.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\nTula tried to apologize and said that they could now be together because she was back. Tace angrily disagreed and pointed out that the Empire was going to murder them because she had given them their position. Tace stormed off into the corridor with Tula pleading with her sister. Despite their falling out, the two sisters reconciled and embraced each other when the Alderaanian fleet battled with [[Dreed's Star Destroyer]]. Due to the intervention of [[Chief]] [[Beon Beonel]]'s warship ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', the Star Destroyer was destroyed and the refugees were saved.<ref name=\"Leia 5\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|But I miss you so much.

She was devastated to learn that her sister Tula was facing execution after the Empire discovered that the rebels knew that Tula had been spying on them.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" /> Tace's angst with her sister's actions led her to shave her hair to avoid being confused with Tula, who was regarded as a traitor.
