Toth'lazhen was a lieutenant to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] crime lord [[Suudaa Nem'ro]], lord of [[Jiguuna]], and was considered the rising star in Nem'ro's circle after his Human rival, [[Karrels Javis]], was blamed for several mishaps. Toth'lazhen urged Nem'ro to remain neutral in the standoff between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Cipher Nine|battle-trained agent]] of [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]], sent to coerce Nem'ro to back the Empire, infiltrated Nem'ro's inner circle under the guise of the \"[[Red Blade]]\", a notorious pirate, and briefly aided Javis' return to prominence before being forced to eliminate him, planting evidence that Nem'ro's rival [[Voontara Fa'athra]] had been responsible. The Agent then went to Toth'lazhen and offered to work against the Fa'athra clan by finding \"proof\" (which was in fact planted by the Agent) of Fa'athra's allegiance to the Republic. Thus convinced, Toth'lazhen advised Nem'ro to cease dealings with the Republic, and offer his services solely to the Sith Empire.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Toth'lazhen\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
