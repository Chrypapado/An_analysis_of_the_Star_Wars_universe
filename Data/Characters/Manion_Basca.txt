He employed political activist [[Gerta Haman]] as his inventory supervisor, never thinking about her political positions.\n\nIn [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], when various people were disappearing themselves from [[Gadrin]] and [[Hedrett]] to join the [[Cularin resistance]], Basca lost both his night shift and his day shift, including Haman. The logo of the resistance was painted in the front of the warehouse. Basca reported to the [[Office of Peace and Security]] but, as nothing had been stolen, the agents were not in a hurry to go.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basca, Manion}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
