You have inherited his skills, but also his weaknesses.|Darth Vader|Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II}}\nThe '''Dark Apprentice''', also known as \"'''Starkiller''',\" was a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] of [[Galen Marek]], a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] taken on by the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] as his secret [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]]. Following Marek's [[Death/Legends|death]], Vader embarked on a quest to create a perfect, obedient duplicate of the man to take Marek's place. Within the [[Timira City|cloning facilities]] of [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], [[Aberrant clone|hundreds of failures]] were produced before the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] succeeded in creating a clone of the deceased apprentice that was able to overcome his [[Prime clone|template's]] emotions and submit himself entirely to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]].\n\nAs his [[Sith training|training]] progressed, the Dark Apprentice surpassed all those who had come before him; he was able to store Marek's [[Memory flash|memories]] independent from his own and suppress the dead man's feelings. Vader planned to have the apprentice face a final test against a [[Subject 1138|rogue clone of Marek]] during the [[Assault on Kamino|Rebel attack]] on Kamino, but the Dark Apprentice did not participate in the battle, and his [[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Master]] was [[Prisoner/Legends|captured]] by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|There is no doubt. This is the one. Stable where the others fail, perfectly in control. I can hardly contain myself. It seems I may after all be allowed to return to my family. I look on him as a sort of salvation. I am not the only one. He has attracted significant attention&hellip;|Entry 51 from the Lead Cloning Technician's log on the Dark Apprentice's progress|Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II}}\nCreated on the [[Ocean/Legends|ocean]]-covered [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]]<ref name=\"DT\" /> around [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]],<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> the Dark Apprentice was a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] of [[Galen Marek]], the [[Death/Legends|deceased]] [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] of the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], grown as part of Vader's endeavor to create a perfect and obedient substitute to take Marek's place.<ref name=\"DT\" /> Several clones had come before him, all of which had been trained using [[memory flash]]es from the original Marek's life. These [[Aberrant clone|predecessors]] had failed to meet expectations in one way or another, either due to [[DNA/Legends|genetic]] defects or succumbing to their [[Prime clone|template's]] emotions, and were subsequently discarded.<ref name=\"TFUII\" />\n\n[[File:Dark_Apprentice_Awakening.png|thumb|left|250px|The Dark Apprentice was one of many clones created by Darth Vader to replace the original Starkiller.]]\nUpon his awakening, presided over by Vader, the Dark Apprentice was confronted with Marek's memories, specifically the [[Gender/Legends|man's]] feelings for his former [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]]-turned-[[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Juno Eclipse]]. Immediately, he asked about her whereabouts, but Vader announced that she was irrelevant&mdash;all that mattered was what needed to be done. This, however, did not prevent the Dark Apprentice from inquiring about who Marek was in the future. When questioned, Vader repeatedly found it unnecessary to answer directly&mdash;rather, he stated the clone had inherited the memories, thoughts and dreams of a broken man, one far less powerful than the Dark Apprentice. As a side effect of the cloning process, he possessed both the skills and weaknesses of his genetic template.<ref name=\"DT\" />\n\nThe Dark Apprentice was trained in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]] against several [[Sith Training Droid]]s. After viewing his progress, Vader showed him the cloning platforms in [[Timira City]]'s clone spire, which displayed all of his rejected brethren locked up in stasis. The clone was determined to surpass all the others, but he was curious as to know how many had preceded him. Vader disregarded the question; instead, he told the Dark Apprentice that the only number that mattered was the quantity of clones that would be needed if he failed like the rest. Vader warned him that if he could not overcome Marek's emotions, he would fail like his predecessors.<ref name=\"DT\" /> Over time, the [[Lead Cloning Technician|lead cloning technician]] noted that the Dark Apprentice was able to compartmentalize the memory imprints used to train him, thereby succeeding where all others had failed&mdash;the clone was able to store Marek's memories independently from his own, freeing him from his template's emotions.<ref name=\"Databank\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'' in-game databank</ref>\n\n[[File:Galen_Marek's_dead_body.png|thumb|right|250px|Vader showed his apprentice the deceased body of Galen Marek, the template of the Starkiller clones.]]\nWith the apprentice free of Marek's memories, Vader brought him to a chamber where his template's lifeless body was kept. The clone understood the significance of the act, and his [[Sith Master/Legends|Master]] believed that he, unlike all the others before him, would prove successful. In a training match against the [[PROXY droid|holodroids]], the Dark Apprentice was able to rise above Marek's emotions, striking down a [[Droid/Legends|droid]] bearing the appearance of Captain Eclipse. To Vader, the clone revealed his disgust and hatred for his template's weaknesses, and his pride for being able to overcome them when those before him had failed. Satisfied, Vader replied that he was almost ready for his final test.<ref name=\"DT\" />\n\nDuring the final stages of the Dark Apprentice's [[Sith training|training]],<ref name=\"DT\" /> a renegade [[Subject 1138|clone of Marek]], who had previously [[Escape from Kamino (1 BBY)|fled]] Kamino, joined with the Rebel Alliance in an [[Assault on Kamino|attack]] on Timira City's [[Timira City Cloning Facility|cloning facilities]].<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> Vader intended to use the battle as a final test for the Dark Apprentice<ref name=\"DT\" /> by drawing Starkiller into a trap atop the cloning spire.<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> Before leaving to confront Starkiller, Vader instructed the Dark Apprentice to wait until his assistance was required. The apprentice announced that he was ready to fulfill the purpose of his creation.<ref name=\"DT\" /> The trap did not go as planned, however. Starkiller bested Vader in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]] but refused to strike him down,<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> having previously seen a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] in which he was killed by Vader's new apprentice&mdash;the reborn Starkiller&mdash;when he attempted to kill his opponent.<ref name=\"Novel\">[[The Force Unleashed II (novel)|''The Force Unleashed II'' novel]]</ref> The [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] Lord was captured by the Alliance upon the battle's conclusion, with no interference from the Dark Apprentice.<ref name=\"TFUII\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I feel nothing&hellip;''\"<br />\"''Nothing?''\"<br />\"''Hate&hellip; for his weaknesses.

During his tutelage on Kamino, the Dark Apprentice was trained in lightsaber combat against multiple Sith training droids, using the dual blade form of combat known as [[Jar'Kai/Legends|Jar'Kai]]. As the clone's training progressed, Vader told the Dark Apprentice that he had become more [[Force power/Legends|powerful]] in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] than the original Starkiller had ever been. By the time of the Rebel attack on Kamino, the Dark Apprentice's deep immersion in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] caused him to manifest its physical effects, making his skin pale and turning his irises [[red]].<ref name=\"DT\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Dark Apprentice, referred to as the \"reborn\" Starkiller, first appeared in [[The Force Unleashed II (novel)|''The Force Unleashed II'' novelization]] in a vision that corresponds with the non-[[canon]] dark side ending to ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]''. In addition to the video game's Databank section, the dark clone's origins were detailed in a series of cutscenes entitled \"Distant Thunder,\" extras in the game which can be unlocked by completing several challenges. In these video clips, [[Sam Witwer]] provides the voice of the Dark Apprentice. As these cutscenes have no impact on the game's progression, and in terms of time placement precede the player's decision between the canonical or non-canonical endings, it is assumed that the Dark Apprentice is canon, even though he does not appear in the light side ending of the game. This is primarily due to the fact that, in the novelization of the game, [[Subject 1138|Starkiller]] experiences a vision wherein he attempts to kill Vader at the end of their duel, but is instead killed by the Dark Apprentice. This revelation ends up becoming one of the reasons for his decision to spare Vader's life. The vision also coincides with the material presented in the \"Distant Thunder\" extras and with the events of the non-canon dark side ending. The Dark Apprentice further appears in extra content that can be downloaded for ''The Force Unleashed II''; a non-canon bonus mission that follows the dark side ending of the game.\n\n===Alternate ending===\n{{Quote|You have faced your final test.''\"<br />\"''What is thy bidding, my Master?''\"<br />\"''Take his starfighter.

Before this can happen, however, a lightsaber blade suddenly appears through the clone's chest. A hooded figure,<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> having used a [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking device]]<ref name=\"Mimobot\">Information found on the Starkiller Mimobot multimedia package included with the collector's edition of ''The Force Unleashed II'' video game</ref> to get near the clone, is revealed to be the wielder of the blade; he proceeds to best [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] [[Rahm Kota]] in a brief duel before [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Choking|Force-choking]] the General and [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Push|pushing]] him and several Rebel troopers into the ocean below as [[Terror Trooper]]s deal with the remaining [[Rebel trooper/Legends|Rebel soldiers]]. Vader approaches the dying clone of Marek, announcing that he lied about the failure of the cloning project as the hooded figure reveals himself to be the Dark Apprentice, Galen Marek's perfect clone whose immersion in the dark side was physically reflected through his pale skin and [[Color/Legends|yellow]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"TFUII\" />\n\nWith the Rebel attack repelled, Vader commends his new [[Sith assassin/Legends|assassin]] for succeeding in his final challenge. The obedient clone kneels before Vader, who tasks him with taking the ''[[Rogue Shadow]]'' to find and eliminate the surviving Rebels scattered throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. As he departs, the Dark Apprentice takes a moment to glance at the lifeless body of Juno Eclipse; feeling no emotions for her, he raises his hood and continues on his way. Escorted by a group of [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]], the Dark Apprentice leaves Kamino in the ''Rogue Shadow'' and enters [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] to fulfill his orders.<ref name=\"TFUII\" />\n\n===''The Battle of Endor'' DLC===\n{{Quote|The Rebels must be stopped before they can destroy the shield generator.

The remnants of the Rebel Alliance launch an attack on the [[Death Star II/Legends|second Death Star]] above the [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon of Endor]], beating back [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial forces]] and gaining access to the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield generator bunker]] with the assistance of the native [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]]. Darth Vader dispatches the Dark Apprentice to the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] to deal with the threat while Vader remains with [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] aboard the new [[battlestation]]. Landing the ''Rogue Shadow'' on Endor, the Dark Apprentice fights through Rebel [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] and Ewoks en route to the bunker, destroying the Alliance's [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] in the process. At the base, the apprentice is confronted by [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], the latter having commandeered an [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]] to guard the bunker's entrance. The clone kills the duo before proceeding into the bunker, where he proceeds to kill Rebels and Imperials alike.<ref name=\"DLC\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'' DLC</ref>\n\nAt the heart of the bunker, the Dark Apprentice encounters [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Prince/Legends|princess]] who [[Jedi training/Legends|became]] a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] after her [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|twin brother's]] death on the planet [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]]. The two duel, with Organa attempting to use the compound's machinery against her opponent. The apprentice repeatedly bests Organa, forcing the fight to continue on the roof of the bunker. Although the dark clone is impressed by Organa's skills, his own abilities enable him to overpower and kill the female Jedi. Aboard the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], the Emperor revels in the Imperial victory before revealing to Vader that he knew of the Dark Apprentice's existence. Referring to his treacherous apprentice as \"Skywalker,\" Palpatine threatens to kill Vader for plotting to overthrow him. Vader activates his [[Darth Vader's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] in an attempt to strike down his Master, but Palpatine forces him to his knees with a barrage of [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]. He proceeds to order Captain [[Sarkli]] to take his forces and kill the apprentice on Endor.
