Living in an [[Takodana Castle|ancient castle]] on the [[planet]] [[Takodana]], Kanata gained a reputation as a \"[[Pirate king|pirate queen]]\" by allowing traveling [[smuggler]]s to reside in her home&mdash;as long as they honored her prohibitions against [[politics]] and war. Kanata spent [[Standard century|centuries]] traveling [[the galaxy]], [[Collector|collecting]] antiques and trinkets, which she kept inside the storehouses and vaults of her castle. One notable item was [[Skywalker lightsaber|the lightsaber]] crafted by [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] during the [[Clone Wars]], and later wielded by Skywalker's son, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]], who was instrumental in toppling the [[Galactic Empire]].\n\nThirty [[Standard year|years]] after the Empire's defeat at the [[Battle of Endor]], the smuggler [[Han Solo]] brought [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], a [[scavenger]] from the [[desert]] planet [[Jakku]], to Kanata's castle. Kanata took interest in the girl, and when the Skywalker [[lightsaber]] called out to Rey through [[the Force]], the smuggler [[queen]] told the scavenger to keep the weapon. However, Rey refused, and shortly before [[stormtrooper]]s of the First Order arrived looking for her she fled the castle. During the ensuing [[Battle of Takodana|battle]], Kanata's castle was destroyed, and Rey was taken prisoner, so Kanata entrusted the lightsaber to [[Finn]], a former [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|First Order stormtrooper]] who abandoned his previous occupation, choosing to help the Resistance.\n\n==Biography==\n===Pirate queen of Takodana===\n{{Quote|She's run this watering hole for a thousand years.|Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\n[[File:Maz_statue.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Maz Kanata gained a reputation as a \"pirate queen.\"]]\n[[Reproduction|Born]] over a [[millennium]] before the [[Cold War|conflict]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]], Maz Kanata was a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Gender|female]] who learned to live and thrive in the criminal underworld of [[the galaxy]].<ref name=\"DB\" /> Living on her [[homeworld]],<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> the [[planet]] [[Takodana]], Kanata resided in a [[Takodana Castle|lakeside castle]] which was home to the ancient [[protocol droid]] [[ME-8D9]], nicknamed \"Emmie.\"<ref name=\"Life Debt\">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref> The castle was a [[Battle of Takodana (Jedi versus Sith)|battleground]] between ancient [[Jedi]] and [[Sith]],<ref name=\"CL\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> and with [[time]], Emmie was rumored to have started out with the [[Jedi Order]].<ref name=\"Emmie\">{{Databank|me-8d9|ME-8D9|archivedate=20190910042521}}</ref> Relatively late during Kanata's stay on Takodana, she [[Marriage|married]], and [[Maz Kanata's husband|her husband]] gifted her a statue in her image.

Initially assuming that the three were up to shenanigans, Kanata was surprised when she opened the box to find the infant [[Qort]] inside. Bringing him inside the castle, Kanata enlisted the help of her [[loadlifter droid]] steward [[HURID-327]], but despite HURID's best efforts Qort would not stop crying.<ref name=\"HRA 9\">[[The High Republic Adventures 9|''The High Republic Adventures'' 9]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maz-Find-Qort.png|thumb|Kanata discovers the infant Qort]]\n\nWhen Kanata went off to get some [[milk]] to feed the child with, Qort used his natural strength and untrained [[Force power]]s to incapacitate the [[droid]], leaving him in pieces on the floor, before escaping to Takodana Castle's basement storerooms. There, Qort found a [[Vonduun crab/Legends|vonduun crab]] [[Bone|skull]] Kanata had been given by her friend [[Farks]], putting it on just before Kanata found him, having been directed after the child by HURID. Calmed by the helmet, Qort would not remove it and did not destroy anything else.<ref name=\"HRA 9\" />\n\nTrying to discover the origins of the child, Kanata called on Farks for information about the skull, and the [[Patrolian]] told her about the Aloxians and the importance of the helmets to their culture. Farks further speculated that the child had been kidnapped by [[Argoban]] raiders, who were known for such practices. Kanata, deciding that the information changed things, decided to get some assistance from [[Sav Malag\u00e1n]], a [[Jedi Master]] stationed at the nearby [[Jedi Temple (Takodana)|Jedi Temple]] and a long-time friend of hers.<ref name=\"HRA 9\" /> Qort's [[The Force|Force-sensitivity]] was eventually discovered, and he was taken in by the [[Jedi Order]].<ref name=\"HRA 1\">[[The High Republic Adventures 1|''The High Republic Adventures'' 1]]</ref>\n\nYears later, following a [[Incident at Vrant Tarnum|debacle]] at [[Vrant Tarnum]] by [[Krix Kamerat]], the leader of a [[Nihil]] [[Krix Kamerat's cell|specialized cell]], the [[Eye of the Nihil]] [[Marchion Ro]] ordered him to find a way to prove himself after, who [[Attack on Takodana|chose]] to attack [[Takodana]], which had a [[Jedi Temple (Takodana)|Jedi Temple]], in the hopes of destroying the [[Jedi temple|temple]] and demonstrating to the Maz Kanata that the Nihil were the only true marauders in the area.

To prevent them from learning too much, she hired [[Saponza's partner|a mercenary]] via [[hologram]] to strike selected Imperial targets on six worlds: Tatooine, [[Dandoran]], [[Er'Kit]], [[Hoth]], [[Yavin 4]], and her home of Takodana. The [[mercenary]] was successful in completing Kanata's objectives, so she rewarded the gunman by employing an [[Ithorian]] [[saboteur]] to work for them.<ref name=\"Commander\">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''&mdash;\"Maz's Objectives\"</ref>\n{{Endgame}}\n\nIn [[4 ABY]], sometime before the climactic [[Battle of Endor]], Kanata traveled to [[Ord Mantell]] where she was reunited with her \"boyfriend,\" the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], and helped [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] to infiltrate into [[Jabba's Palace]] to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] [[Han Solo]] from [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] by suggesting she disguise herself as the [[bounty hunter]] [[Boushh]].<ref name=\"Bounty Hunted\">{{FOD|Bounty Hunted}}</ref>\n\n===New Republic Era===\nAfter Sidious was [[Death|killed]] by former Jedi Anakin Skywalker during the Battle of [[Endor]], Kanata felt again comfortable sharing her Force-sensitivity.<ref name=\"TVD\" /> Not long after the battle, Kanata once more made the acquaintance of Solo, serving him [[Parkellan Sling]]s and admonishing him for not bringing Chewbacca. Correctly guessing that he was there for something, she interrogated him and was told that he was meeting an Imperial defector, [[Ralsius Paldora]], regarding information that would help him [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|free]] the Wookiees on [[Kashyyyk]], who were still suffering under Imperial rule.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>\n\nWarning Solo of dire consequences should he bring the Empire's attention to her doorstep, Kanata pointed him in the direction of the crowd. Unfortunately, the Empire did indeed [[Skirmish on Takodana|arrive]] on Takodana looking for their pilfered information and Kanata immediately assumed Solo was responsible, reminding him of her one absolute rule. She later contacted him for a further tongue-lashing when Imperial air reinforcements, consisting of a light cruiser and multiple TIE fighters, appeared over [[Nymeve Lake]], ordering him to clean up his mess (though assuring Chewbacca that she didn't blame him) and then to leave once the Imperials were dealt with.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\nIn [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"Life Debt Date\">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> Kanata's home was visited by [[Romwell Krass Junior]], an [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[agent]] who had narrowly escaped a [[New Republic]] [[Attack on the Hyborean Moon|attack]] on the [[Hyborean Moon]] which took the lives of his family and friends. On the third day of his stay, Krass was drinking at Kanata's bar when he saw a [[Unidentified New Republic pilot|New Republic pilot]]. Krass assaulted the man, blaming the [[pilot]] for his family's death. The fight was stopped by Emmie, who informed the two that they had violated the castle rules; as such, she rendered them unconscious and brought them to cells within the castle's dungeon.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWhen the two awoke, they began yelling at each other, before Kanata arrived and told them to be silent. Retrieving a step-stool from the wall, Kanata climbed to look through the windowed door of Krass' cell, adjusting her goggles and telling the Imperial to come closer. As she examined Krass, she told him that she saw his suffering, as well as the suffering caused by him. Declaring that the Empire was dead, Kanata unlocked the cell, telling Krass to leave the castle and find peace. After the Imperial left, Kanata granted the pilot freedom, and she went to meditate on a parapet overlooking Nymeve Lake. Emmie joined the pirate, stating that the castle was at peace. Kanata, responding that her heart was not at peace, told Emmie that the Force felt off balance. Requesting that the [[droid]] prepare her [[starship]], the ''[[Tua-Lu]]'', for flight, Kanata added that she wished to look around the galaxy and see what she could see.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nIn the time that followed, Skywalker's son, Luke, the last remaining Jedi,<ref name=\"VI\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> began training a new generation of warriors. However, Skywalker vanished when his Jedi were [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed]] by [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]], a pupil of his who went on to lead the First Order, the organization born from the Empire's remnants. At some point in her travels, Kanata acquired [[Skywalker lightsaber|Skywalker's lightsaber]], which was constructed by Anakin and later wielded by Luke. Cognisant of the [[lightsaber]]'s greatness, Kanata stored the weapon in an ancient, [[wroshyr wood]] [[Maz's Curio Box|curio box]], along with a four-thousand-year-old [[hyperspace sextant]], a [[fusioncutter]] head, and a [[diatium power cell]].<ref name=\"TVD\" />\n\n===Rise of the First Order===\n{{Quote|Through the ages&hellip;I've seen evil take many forms.

Assuming that Solo needed desperate help with something, Kanata led the group to a table to eat and discuss their dilemma.<ref name=\"VII\" />\n\nSolo explained that the droid BB-8 contained a map leading to Luke Skywalker, and that it needed to be delivered to his wife, Resistance [[General]] Leia Organa, with whom Solo was estranged. Kanata refused, saying that Solo had been avoiding the fight for too long, and he needed to go home. Finn objected Kanata's answer, while Rey asked Kanata what \"fight\" she was referring to. Kanata explained that there was only one fight: the fight against the [[dark side of the Force]], which took the form of the Sith, the Empire, and the First Order. Kanata went on to argue that they should all oppose the spreading of the First Order, but Finn insisted that a fight against the First Order could not be won. As Finn spoke, Kanata adjusted her variable lens corrective [[goggles]], crawled up onto the table, and looked into Finn's [[eye]]s, saying that he had the eyes of a man who wanted to run. Finn, telling Kanata she did not know the things he had seen, suggested that they all needed to run. Resigned, Kanata climbed down from the table and directed Finn to [[Sidon Ithano]] and [[Quiggold]], two pirates who would trade work for transportation to the galaxy's [[Outer Rim Territories]]. Finn stood up and left, and when Rey went after him, Kanata asked Solo who she was.<ref name=\"VII\" />\n\n[[File:Maz_talking_to_Rey.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kanata tells Rey about the Skywalker lightsaber.]]\nThe smuggler informed Kanata that Rey lived alone on Jakku, and that the scavenger wished to return there, believing her family would be coming back. Kanata went to speak with Rey, finding the [[human]] with BB-8 in a lower level hall, stumbling out of a storeroom and looking shaken. Rey, who had a vision after coming into contact with the Skywalker lightsaber, asked Kanata what it was, saying she regretted entering the room. Kanata explained that the lightsaber belonged to Luke and his father before him, and it was then calling to her. Rey responded by insisting she return to Jakku, but Kanata, removing her goggles and taking the girl's hand, told her that she already knew the truth: whomever Rey was awaiting would never come back. However, Kanata added that while no one from Rey's past was returning, there was someone who still could, so Rey replied that the person was Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"VII\" />\n\nMaz then told Rey, that what she sought was not behind her, but ahead. Kanata admitted that she was not a Jedi herself, but she still knew the Force, explaining that it moved through and surrounded every living thing. Instructing Rey to close her eyes and feel the [[light side of the Force]], the pirate told the scavenger that it would always guide her, and that the girl should keep the lightsaber. However, Rey stated that she would never touch the weapon again, and that she wanted nothing to do with the Force.<ref name=\"VII\" /> Kanata stammered as Rey, followed by BB-8, quickly left the hall, leaving the pirate alone with her thoughts: one could teach knowledge, skills, and even the Force, but not patience.<ref name=\"Novel\">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maz_Lightsaber.png|thumb|right|300px|Kanata gives the lightsaber to Finn.]]\nShortly after Rey left, patrons of the castle hurried outside to witness the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the New Republic's [[capital]], [[Hosnian Prime]], visible in the [[Atmosphere|sky]] above. Finn deduced it was an act of the First Order, and he regrouped with Solo and Chewbacca, asking where Rey was.<ref name=\"VII\" /> Kanata approached the group and told them that Rey was where she needed to be, and said there was something they should see.<ref name=\"Junior\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> The pirate led them to the storeroom where Rey was, and she presented the lightsaber to Finn. Solo, who had been a close friend of Luke's, asked where Kanata got the weapon, but Kanata dismissed him, saying it was a story for another time. Telling Finn to find Rey, Kanata passed the lightsaber to him. But before they left the room, the castle shook, signaling the arrival of the First Order, and the hallway collapsed as [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|First Order TIE fighters]] leveled the castle.<ref name=\"VII\" />\n\nLed by Chewbacca, the four cleared a tunnel to the surface, where the Wookiee and Solo immediately joined the [[Battle of Takodana|battle]] against the First Order [[troop]]s. Finn and Kanata exited next, and the pirate ordered Finn to find and help Rey and BB-8. However, Finn insisted that he needed a weapon first, so Kanata reminded him that he already had one, seizing his wrist that held the lightsaber. Finn activated the blade and entered the fight alongside Solo and Chewbacca until forces of the Resistance arrived to provide support. However, despite the Resistance's arrival and the retreat of the First Order's forces, Finn was unable to prevent Rey from being taken captive by Kylo Ren.<ref name=\"VII\" /> In the battle's aftermath, Kanata spoke with BB-8, telling the droid that although the First Order took Rey, they could not give up hope, and the Resistance needed the astromech's help. Kanata then walked over to Finn, joking that she had some cleaning up to do. Looking up at Finn, Kanata smiled with satisfaction, noting that she no longer saw the eyes of a coward, but the eyes of a warrior.<ref name=\"Novel\" />\n\n===Helping the Resistance===\n{{Quote|He's a master codebreaker, an ace pilot, a poet with a blaster.|Maz Kanata to Finn, Rose Tico, and [[Poe Dameron]]|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}\n[[File:Moxie-Convergence.png|thumb|left|250px|Maz amidst her \"union dispute.\"]]\nAfter the destruction of her castle, Kanata resumed her life of adventure whilst the Resistance continued their struggle against the First Order.

When Leia sensed Rey and her son, Kylo Ren dueling on [[Kef Bir]], Maz knew that the only way for Leia to save her son would be to use all the strength she had left to reach him. When Leia passed away, Maz and other members of the Resistance gathered around her body to bid her farewell. Maz was also present when Leia's body became one with the Force. When the Resistance returned from victory on Exegol, Maz welcomed Chewie home and presented him the [[Medal of Bravery]].<ref name=\"Episode IX\">[[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Maz is a bit of an acquired taste&hellip; so let me do the talking.|Han Solo to Rey and Finn|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\nKanata was a [[humanoid]] [[alien]] who stood at a height of 1.24 [[meter]]s (4 [[Foot|feet]] and 1 [[inch]]).<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> She had [[Color|brown]] eyes, wispy white hair,<ref name=\"VII\" /> and burnt-orange skin.<ref name=\"Handprint\" /> Her face was wrinkled by centuries of hearty laughter and kind smiles.<ref name=\"Rey's Story\">''[[The Force Awakens: Rey's Story]]''</ref> Due to the pirate's millennia-long lifespan, decades were like brief moments in time for her.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\nAs a [[poet]] and [[Artist|painter]], Kanata took delight in all forms of art, so she offered board to traveling musicians in exchange for their performances.

Abrams]]. In [[March]] [[2013]], preliminary screenwriter [[Michael Arndt]] realized a \"[[Yoda]]-like mentor figure\" for the protagonists, the character which became Maz Kanata. Earlier in the production, Abrams and co-production designer [[Rick Carter]] had discovered they shared a common teacher: award-winning high school instructor [[Rose Gilbert]], who taught until her retirement at the age of 94.

The crash landing causes damage to a ship owned by the pirate [[Hondo Ohnaka]], and the [[Dowutin]] [[Grummgar]] brings the pilot responsible, [[Zander Freemaker]], into the castle to meet with the [[Weequay]] pirate captain. Encountering Ohnaka, Grummgar restrains Zander, and Ohnaka tells him that the damages must be paid for. Zander replies that he has no money, and Ohnaka replies that he will also accept [[blood]], limbs, or next of kin as payment. Zander's younger brother, [[Rowan Freemaker/LEGO|Rowan]], attacks Grummgar, demanding that his brother be set free. Grummgar lifts Rowan up with one hand, and Ohnaka jokes that the boy would make a good crew member if he were taller. As Ohnaka laughs, Kanata notices the commotion and throws a mug at the pirate, hitting him in the head. Picking up another cup threateningly, Kanata walks toward Ohnaka, affirming that he will not cause any trouble in the castle, something he has done before. Stopping Ohnaka as he begins to act coy, Kanata comments that the last incident involving him had her pulling teeth out the castle walls for weeks. Agreeing to work out the problem peacefully, Ohnaka begins to make a deal with [[Kordi Freemaker/LEGO|Kordi Freemaker]], so Kanata leaves them and enters through a door to another room. However, as the door opens, Rowan senses a [[Kyber crystal|crystal]] of the [[Kyber Saber]], an ancient Jedi weapon, and he follows Kanata. Just before Rowan enters the room, Kanata stops him, asking if he is lost and stating that only she is allowed in there. Rowan apologizes, saying he thought he felt something. Kanata inquires what he felt, but Rowan changes his mind and leaves.<ref name=\"The Test\" />\n\nThe Freemakers embark on Ohnaka's mission to recover three golden orbs from the [[third moon of Takodana]], but they choose to return empty-handed when they learn the orbs are [[varactyl]] [[egg]]s. When Kordi offers to try another deal instead, Ohnaka scoffs, and as he orders his crew to kill the Freemakers, Kanata enters the room and throws another mug at his head. Kanata, who overheard that Ohnaka sent kids to do a dangerous task, approaches the Weequay, again striking him with a mug and pushing him towards the castle's exit, telling him not to come back until she is no longer angry. When Ohnaka tries convincing Kanata to let him stay, she hits twice more before he leaves. Remarking that there is no decency left in the galaxy, she instructs the three Freemakers to follow her into the other room. Saying that their presence is bad for business, Kanata offers to provide them with what they need to leave the planet. Zander requests a [[quantum field regulator]], and Kanata opens a drawer and asks him what type he needs. Slightly confused, Zander asks for a [[Double-A type quantum field regulator|double-A type]] for a [[Class-D cargo container|Class-D salvage ship]], and to his surprise, Kanata removes one from the drawer. Running to the drawer, Zander asks what else she has, but Kanata dismisses him and turns her attention to Rowan. Commenting how she likes his smile and the way he confronted Ohnaka, Kanata opens a locked drawer and removes a Kyber Saber crystal. She presents it to the excited boy, explaining that she found it on [[Rodia]] ages ago. When Kordi asks how they can thank Kanata, the pirate says that they can leave. As she escorts them out the door, Kanata tells the Freemakers that they are nice kids, but that her castle is not a place for nice or kids. Rowan is the last to exit, and Kanata stops to tell him that searching for the Kyber crystals is a noble quest, adding that when they inevitably get desperate they should seek the \"[[Jek-14/LEGO|Maker of Zoh]].\" When Rowan asks what she means, Kanata acts senile, says bye, and hurries into her castle.<ref name=\"The Test\" />\n\nIn ''The Resistance Rises'', which is set after the Galactic Civil War, the pirate [[Bala-Tik]] meets with Kanata to complete a trade: a concealed item Kanata wants in her collection, for the location of Solo (who had cheated Bala-Tik out of [[rathtar]]s). However, nearly everybody in Kanata's castle has been cheated by Solo, and the patrons begin to argue over who was swindled the worst. A brawl quickly erupts, and when Kanata's genuine \"[[Prince]]ss Leia Battle of Endor [[speeder bike]]\" breaks as a result, Kanata becomes enraged, retrieving the Skywalker lightsaber, cutting the ceiling's masonry to fall on her quarreling guests, and declaring the fight to be over. With the commotion stopped, a hooded individual tells the patrons that Solo's ship was last sighted on Jakku, and that the smuggler would not stay in one place for long. As the criminals race out the castle's door, Kanata approaches the figure, immediately recognizing him to be [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]. The two collect the case Bala-Tik left behind and open it to reveal two musical instruments. Kanata begins to play, and she invites Calrissian to join, who gladly accepts.<ref name=\"Hunting for Han\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|\n*''[[The High Republic: Out of the Shadows]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The High Republic: Out of the Shadows (audiobook)|''The High Republic: Out of the Shadows'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*[[The High Republic Adventures 8|''The High Republic Adventures'' 8]] {{Mo}}\n*[[The High Republic Adventures 9|''The High Republic Adventures'' 9]]\n*[[The High Republic Adventures 10|''The High Republic Adventures'' 10]]\n*{{Shortstory|story=A Recipe for Death|book=Tales from a Galaxy Far, Far Away: Aliens: Volume I}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Master & Apprentice]]'' {{Hologram}} {{Flash}}\n*[[Master & Apprentice (audiobook)|''Master & Apprentice'' audiobook]] {{Hologram}} {{Flash}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] {{1st}} {{Ret}} {{C|Appears as a statue}}\n*''[[5-Minute Star Wars Villain Stories]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''\n*{{FOD|Monster Misunderstanding}} {{C|Voice only;
