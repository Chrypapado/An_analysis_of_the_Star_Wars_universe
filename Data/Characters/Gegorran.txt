Due to increasing fears of [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] insurgents and terrorists working against [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]] which resulted in increasing regulations meant to \"keep order,\" but were in reality thinly-disguised attempts to expedite the planned coup by Vaklu against [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]], he could only sell his products to people with [[starport visa]]s. Gegorran desperately wanted to leave the planet before trouble could start but since he lacked a starport visa it was impossible to leave the city.\n\nGegorran was obviously nervous about the state of things in Iziz, affecting an overly friendly and enthusiastic manner to compensate. He repeatedly let slip that he was neither as generally happy nor as loyal to Vaklu as he claimed, prompting the [[Onderon separatists|Vaklu-loyal]] [[Onderon Soldier|soldier]] posted at his store to warn him: \"Watch it, Geg. The captain already has enough complaints about you\".\n\nThe merchant also said that in addition to being unable to sell anything to anyone who did not have a starport visa, he had to sell to soldiers (always ones loyal to Vaklu) at such steep discounts he was practically being robbed of his wares. He implied he had been threatened into doing this, but quickly denied it when the nearby soldier asked him about these comments.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n*At the beginning of ''Knights of the Old Republic II'', if the player chooses to be a male [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]], Gegorran has his picture in the list of portraits.\n*After you fight with Vaklu's men he refuses to talk to you: \"I have, ah, witnessed your little incident just now. I'm afraid I have nothing more to say. Good luck in your travels!\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gegorran\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
