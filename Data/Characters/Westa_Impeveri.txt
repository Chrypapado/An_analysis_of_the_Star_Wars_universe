He was a small-time criminal who served as a spokesperson and intermediary for various minor [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lords]]. His employers kept changing due to power struggles and assassinations, or sometimes his services were bet away in [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] games. Trying to escape that life, Impeveri stowed away on a ship heading for [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], but he was discovered and tossed off in [[Hedrett]].<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nMaking the best of the situation, Westa Impeveri got involved in the local politics in [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]]. His knack for gathering secrets served him well in his new career. Sometime during this period, Impeveri fathered a [[Alina Impeveri|daughter]]. Eventually, after serving a time as a junior counselor, he used the power of those secrets to oust a popular senior counselor and get elected senior counselor himself. His opponent in the election, [[Karid Blakken]], accused Impeveri of rigging the ballot box. The votes were recounted, but Impeveri was found innocent of that charge.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nWesta had a very open and trustworthy air about him, which made it easy for people to confide in him. He was only a competent senior counselor, but his apparent openness made him a lot of friends on the council.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\nIn around [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"20 BBY\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is dated to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' [[Cularin's disappearance|moved]] the campaign forward ten years to the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]].</ref> Counselor Impeveri traveled to the [[Almas Academy]], to take part in a private ceremony of gratitude towards the heroes who defeated slaver [[Phylus Mon]].<ref name=\"AMA\">''[[A Mon Alone]]''</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the [[2008]] reference book ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', Impeveri's slicer handle from the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] article [[Destabilization (RPG adventure)|''Destabilization'']], \"IMPEVERI,\" was misspelled \"IMPEREVI.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[An Uneasy Peace]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Oblivion's Kiss]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Quarters]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Halves]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Holes]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Peaces]]''\n*''[[Here and Thaere]]''\n*''[[Force Convergence]]''\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]''\n*''[[The Heart]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020725agalaxy&c=swlfc|text=A Changing Galaxy|int=A Changing Galaxy|archivedate=20030813173039}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20021205nirama|text=That Is Nirama's Word|int=That Is Nirama's Word|archivedate=20060314170300}} {{Imo}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040105|text=Destabilization|int=Destabilization (RPG adventure)|archivedate=20091016033448}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20040603|text=Political Platforms|int=Political Platforms|archivedate=20080503151316}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20041209|text=Tramsig's Plan|int=Tramsig's Plan|archivedate=20091016001955}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Impeveri, Westa}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Legislators and councilors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
