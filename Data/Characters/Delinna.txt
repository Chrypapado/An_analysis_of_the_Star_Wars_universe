When Kiirloor began to suffer a series of problems that culminated in the disappearance of [[Chywarra|a child]], Delinna traveled with Surracca to [[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]] [[Dariana]]'s [[naming day]] ceremony, to ask her for help. Surracca was very angry because of the problems at Kiirloor, so Delinna tried to calm him down. The two Wookiees then traveled back to the village with the [[Heroes of Cularin]]. However, while they traveled, there was a groundquake and they arrived at the village to find it very damaged.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[From the Trees]]''\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
