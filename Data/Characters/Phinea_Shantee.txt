A local thug was on his way to break her legs, but an unknown [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] intervened to help. The spacer killed the thug, named [[Chalurrekk]], and returned to Phinea. Thankful, Phinea gave the spacer a few [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and a six-sided [[Chance cube/Legends|die]].\n\nHowever, Phinea's problems were not yet over. She wanted the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] crime boss killed, so that she could live in peace. The spacer succeeded in killing the Trandoshan, and was awarded with a bottle of [[Wine/Legends|wine]] for his work.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPhinea Shantee was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:MMORPG|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.
