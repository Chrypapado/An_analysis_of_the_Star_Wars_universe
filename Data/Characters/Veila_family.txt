A descendant of [[Tahiri Veila's grandfather|one of the last members]] of the first [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], Veila's [[Cassa Veila|mother]] and [[Tryst Veila|father]] also possessed a strong affinity to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Ultimately, Veila was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Knight]] of the [[New Jedi Order]], and by extension, the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]]. Her allegiance to the Jedi was severed when she joined the [[Lumiya's Sith|Sith Order]] as the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] of [[Darth Caedus]]. After the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord's]] [[Death/Legends|death]], Veila briefly lived as a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] before joining the [[Imperial Remnant]].\n\n==History==\nThe first known member of [[Tahiri Veila]]'s family was her [[Tahiri Veila's grandfather|grandfather]], a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] of the original [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] who lived during the [[Rise of the Empire era|waning]] [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"Anakin's Quest\" /> His lineage was carried on through the [[Marriage/Legends|union]] of two [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmers]], [[Tryst Veila|Tryst]] and [[Cassa Veila]]. In [[13 ABY/Legends|13 ABY]], Cassa gave birth to their daughter and only offspring, Tahiri, whom they raised on their [[Moisture farm/Legends|moisture farm]] while living in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].<ref name=\"Promises\" />\n\nBoth Tryst and Cassa were [[Death/Legends|killed]] in [[15 ABY/Legends|15 ABY]] by a group of [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]], unaware of the fact that they had nursed one of their own back to health. [[Sliven]], the Tusken Raider whom the Veilas helped, saved the orphaned Tahiri from the Sand People by adopting her as his own daughter. Veila remained with the Sand People until [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]] when she was discovered and recruited into the [[New Jedi Order]].<ref name=\"Promises\" /> [[Jedi training/Legends|Trained in the Jedi Arts]] by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] [[Ikrit]],<ref name=\"Lyric's World\">''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Lyric's World]]''</ref> Veila eventually became a Jedi like her grandfather before her, thus wielding [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] in the service of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]<ref name=\"The Golden Globe\" /> and its successor state, the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]].<ref name=\"Remnant\" />\n\nUltimately, Veila renounced her ties to the Jedi and her family's legacy in order to become a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. Falling to the seduction of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], she became the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] of [[Darth Caedus]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and a [[Skywalker family/Legends|direct descendant]] of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].<ref name=\"Revelation\" /> Shortly before the [[Battle of Uroro Station|fall]] of her [[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Master]], she lost the will to carry on as a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lady]] and surrendered to the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref> Neither Jedi or Sith, Veila took up a freelance role as a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] before<ref name=\"Outcast\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref> being recruited into the service of the [[Imperial Remnant]] as the personal [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] of [[Head of State/Legends|Head of State]] [[Jagged Fel]].<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\n==Family tree==\n{{FamilyTree/start}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | |GRAND|GRAND=[[Tahiri Veila's grandfather]]<ref name=\"Anakin's Quest\" />}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | |TRYST |y|CASSA ||TRYST=[[Tryst Veila]]<ref name=\"Promises\" />|CASSA=[[Cassa Veila]]<ref name=\"Promises\" />}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | | |TAHIRI| ||TAHIRI=[[Tahiri Veila]]<br />{{C|adopted by [[Sliven]]}}<ref name=\"The Golden Globe\" />}}\n{{FamilyTree/end}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOn the basis of the information given in ''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest]]'', it is not possible to determine which one of Tahiri's parents is the child of the unidentified male Jedi in Tahiri's vision. According to the previous installment of the [[Star Wars: Junior Jedi Knights|series]], ''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Promises]]'', Tryst Veila has green eyes, Cassa Veila has blond hair, and both are Force-sensitive, meaning both remain equally potential candidates. Consequently, it is also unknown whether the last name \"Veila\" is inherited from the Jedi's side of the family.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Promises]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest]]'' {{Vision|[[Tahiri Veila]]}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Familie Veila\n}}\n\n[[Category:Families]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitive bloodlines]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
