There are too many worlds I still haven't fleeced!|Rik Duel|Star Wars (1977) 82}}\n'''Rik Duel''' was a brash, egotistical [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] smuggler who lead [[Chihdo]] and [[Dani]] from one get-rich-quick scam to another, most often not according to plan.\n\nDuel was a thief and a double-crossing, swindling ladies' man who knew [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] in his youth, and later would cross paths with Solo, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], and [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] on [[Stenos/Legends|Stenos]].\n\n==Biography==\nAs a smuggler, Duel encountered Solo on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] years before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. He fought in the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]], joining with other denizens of the Smugglers' Moon as the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] attempted to crack down on the criminal activity centered there.<ref name=\"THG\">''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''</ref> At some point, Duel became partners with the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Chihdo]] and a [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] woman named [[Dani]].\n\n===The Stenax Shuffle===\nA few years after the Battle of Nar Shaddaa, Duel made a deal with [[Quorl Matrin]], Imperial [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] of the planet [[Stenos/Legends|Stenos]], to uncover the statue of the [[Stenax]] god [[Vol]] to expand the former senator's collection. The statue had been buried during an earthquake years earlier, causing the winged Stenaxes to stop flying in disgrace. Rik, Dani and Chihdo began digging for the statue in an old temple that had served as a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] base commanded by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Pejanes Kindar]]. Their search was interrupted when Princess Leia arrived, along with Solo, [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], Skywalker and his droids. Always ready for a con, Duel claimed that he and his partners had actually joined the Rebellion and were left behind by Kindar to find the Vol statue. Solo was immediately suspicious of his old \"friend\", but agreed to help find the statue.\n\nOnce they uncovered Vol, Rik took the statue for himself and betrayed the Rebels to Matrin. As [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] arrived to capture Solo and the others, Duel and his friends made their escape, hoping to keep the statue for themselves. The Rebels were saved by the timely arrival of the now-flying Stenaxes, who demanded Vol. Solo referred them to Duel. Duel and friends arrived at Rik's ship, the [[Moonshadow (Rik Duel's)|''Moonshadow'']], only to find Matrin and a contingent of stormtroopers waiting to take the statue and kill them. Suddenly, the Stenaxes arrived, attacking the group. Rik cursed Solo as the attack began, but then the quick-thinking smuggler shouted that Matrin was dishonoring Vol. The governor and his troopers were torn to pieces by the Stenaxes. Rik, Dani and Chihdo escaped in the confusion.<ref name=\"mc70\">[[Star Wars (1977) 70|''Star Wars'' (1977) 70]]</ref>\n\n===Bounty on Stenos===\nThree years later, Duel encountered Luke Skywalker on Stenos where recent Imperial crackdowns were making life harder for a simple criminal. Skywalker and Lando Calrissian were searching for [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]] and [[IG-88B/Legends|IG-88]], hoping they could lead them to Han Solo, still frozen in carbonite. They ran into Duel and Dani, who were searching for Chihdo, who had recently gone missing. Duel asked for Skywalker's help, but the Rebel was called away by Calrissian reporting he had found Solo. He led Skywalker to a figure frozen in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] only to find that it was actually Chihdo.<ref name=\"mc71\">[[Star Wars (1977) 71|''Star Wars'' (1977) 71]]</ref>\n\nBossk, IG-88 and other bounty hunters had set up their own [[Carbon-freezing chamber/Legends|carbon-freezing chamber]] there. The hunters were closing in on the Rebels before Rik and Dani appeared for an almost-successful rescue. Rik and Skywalker escaped, but Dani and Calrissian were captured. Eventually, with the help of a number of Stenaxes recruited by [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], the bounty hunters were defeated. Rik remained on Stenos, eventually finding out how to free Chihdo from the carbonite after Skywalker and Calrissian moved on to their next stop, along with stowaway Dani.<ref name=\"mc72\">[[Star Wars (1977) 72|''Star Wars'' (1977) 72]]</ref>\n\n===After Endor===\nWithin weeks after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Rik, Chihdo and Dani began looting worlds left in ruins after the Empire's retreat in the chaos following [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] death. One of their stops was water-world [[Iskalon/Legends|Iskalon's]] abandoned surface facility, [[Pavillion]]. The trio was soon interrupted by the arrival of Luke Skywalker, who had come to offer the [[Iskalonian]]s a place in the newly forming government. Luke scolded them, but Rik explained that everyone in the galaxy does what they have to do to survive, and the weak were out of luck. Rik's speech was cut short by a hungry [[chiaki]] sea creature and a sudden attack by the Iskalonians. The natives no longer wanted anything to do with offworlders, and after a brief protest, Rik acceded to Skywalker's suggestion they all leave. Only an Iskalonian named [[Kiro]]&mdash;an old friend of Luke's&mdash;decided to go with them. Skywalker recruited Duel and his partners to give Kiro passage in the ''Moonshadow''. This would also give Skywalker a chance to keep Rik and the others out of trouble.<ref name=\"mc82\">[[Star Wars (1977) 82|''Star Wars'' 82]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Moonshadow.jpg|thumb|The ''Moonshadow'' over Shawken.]]\n\nThe group continued on to Skywalker's next diplomatic mission on [[Shawken]], where Rik, Chihdo and Dani explored the planet's ruins while Luke and Kiro met with local officials. While searching for priceless artifacts to steal, they accidentally trapped themselves in an underground chamber and triggered the countdown of an [[Shawken Device|ancient weapon]] that could theoretically destroy the entire universe. Skywalker and [[Plif]] the [[Hoojib/Legends|hoojib]] eventually freed Duel and the others, while Kiro's near-fatal sacrifice destroyed the machine.<ref name=\"MC87\">[[Star Wars (1977) 87|''Star Wars'' 87]]</ref>\n\nThe ''Moonshadow'' then followed Skywalker back to the Alliance's temporary base on [[Endor/Legends|Endor]]. After an altercation with Rebel soldiers over a card game,<ref name=\"MC90\">[[Star Wars (1977) 90|''Star Wars'' 90]]</ref> Rik stayed on Endor a short time longer before realizing there was little profit to be gained there. He and Chihdo soon departed though Dani chose to stay with the [[Alliance of Free Planets|Alliance]] in the wake of the supposed death of Kiro, whom she had fallen in love with.<ref name=\"MC92\">[[Star Wars (1977) 92|''Star Wars'' 92]]</ref><ref name=\"MC99\">[[Star Wars (1977) 99|''Star Wars'' 99]]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRik Duel was created by [[Mary Jo Duffy]], [[Kerry Gammill]] and [[Tom Palmer]]. Gammill based Duel's appearance on the likeness of his friend, visual effects legend Rick Baker.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 70|''Star Wars'' (1977) 70]] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 71|''Star Wars'' (1977) 71]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 72|''Star Wars'' (1977) 72]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 73|''Star Wars'' (1977) 73]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 82|''Star Wars'' 82]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 87|''Star Wars'' 87]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 90|''Star Wars'' 90]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 92|''Star Wars'' 92]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 99|''Star Wars'' 99]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'' {{C|As \"Rik\"}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040105zeltros|text=Zeltros: Pleasure Planet|int=Zeltros: Pleasure Planet|archivedate=20091016021820}}\n*{{GamerCite|1|The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Marvel Series}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Han|archivedate=20110903234809}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rik Duel\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians|Duel, Rik]]\n[[Category:Humans|Duel, Rik]]\n[[Category:Males|Duel, Rik]]\n[[Category:Smugglers|Duel, Rik]]\n[[Category:Thieves|Duel, Rik]]"}}}]}}}}
