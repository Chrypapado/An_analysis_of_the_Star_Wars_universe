She specialized in fast deliveries.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] specialized in high-speed deliveries and courier work, Elga Arbo bought a modified [[Starfeld Industries/Legends|Starfeld Industries]] [[Z-10 Seeker-class scout ship|Z-10 Seeker]], the ''[[Redshift Runner]]'', from an independent [[Scout/Legends|scout]]. She intended to convert it into the fastest possible ship, and to do so she had the help of [[Maceb Joodsen]], a co-pilot and [[Starship/Legends|starship]] mechanic from [[Demar]], and of [[Gydio Lucone]], a usurer who lend Arbo some money to improve the ship's [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]].\n\nLucone had purposefully signed strict conditions so that, should Arbo did not pay monthly, Lucone would then impound the ship. Lucone did hoped this situation would happen, as it would give Lucone the chance to blackmail Arbo and make her [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggle]] for Lucone. However, Arbo systematically paid in time and at the same time she got a reputation as a legal pilot.\n\nOne day, the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] ordered a shutdown in a stopover starport, which delayed Arbo for three days in her next pay. Lucone moved in to claim the ship, which Arbo attempted to stop and violence ensued. Arbo was seriously injured during the fight, but she eventually escaped on the ''Runner'', with Joodsen piloting.\n\nLucone then issued a 20000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] for the ship. Three months later, the bounty had not been claimed.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Stock Ships]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arbo, Elga}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
