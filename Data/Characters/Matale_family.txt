They lived in a private [[Matale estate|estate]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. The Matale family had a long running feud with the [[Sandral family]]. Even with assistance from the [[Jedi Enclave]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], no compromise could be reached to settle the arguing.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nAfter the disappearance of [[Nurik Sandral]]'s son, [[Casus Sandral]], Nurik believed Casus had been [[Death/Legends|killed]] by the Matales and kidnapped Shen in retaliation. When the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] arrived at the Sandral estate as an [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], he was told of the kidnapping by Nurik's daughter and Shen's lover, [[Rahasia Sandral]]. Due to Revan's intervention, Shen escaped with Rahasia, but both were ambushed by their parents outside the estate. Revan was able to convince the fathers to allow their kids to live their own lives, and the two patriarchs agreed to purchase a new house for their offspring to reside in together.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nAt some point following the [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|attack]] on Dantooine by [[Darth Malak]], the Matale family was \"removed\" from Dantooine.{{Fact}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn content cut from ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', [[Kaevee]] would have told the [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]] that all members of the Matale family were killed and their estate was burned when the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] invaded Dantooine prior to the events of that game. Since this was ultimately cut from the final game, however, this is considered non-[[canon]].<ref name=\"KOTOR 2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref>\n\nIf Revan fails to persuade Ahlan or Nurik to allow their children to marry, Shen and Rahasia run away to the Jedi Enclave, leaving their families behind. Revan can also convince Shen to leave Rahasia and return home with his father. Another possibility is that Revan helps Shen escape with Rahasia and is then confronted by Ahlan Matale and [[Nurik Sandral]], who are accompanied by two battle [[Sentinel droid|droids]] each; Revan can incite violence between the two families and the result is Nurik, Ahlan, Shen, and Rahasia are killed. Revan can then lie about this to the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{Mo}} {{C|cut content}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Familie Matale\n|pl=Matale\n|ru=\u0421\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Families|Matale]]"}}}]}}}}
