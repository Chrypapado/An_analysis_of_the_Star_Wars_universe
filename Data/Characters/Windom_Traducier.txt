Windom was part of [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]]'s plot to attack the New Republic [[capital]] of [[Chandrila]] by using a transponder to broadcast signals that turned liberated [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|rebel]] [[prisoner]]s from [[Ashmead's Lock]] into unwilling [[assassin]]s that attacked [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] and other New Republic leaders. Following the [[attack on Chandrila]], Windom was captured and investigated by the [[New Republic Security Bureau]]. He was promptly [[Death|murdered]] by the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], who had joined the New Republic.\n\n==Biography==\nWindom Traducier was an undercover [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[agent]] of [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]] who worked as a [[New Republic]] [[Senate Guard (New Republic)|Senate Guardsman]] on the [[planet]] [[Chandrila]]<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> in [[5 ABY]].<ref name=\"Life Debt Date\" /> Windom was guarding the former Imperial [[Advisor|Adviser]] [[Yupe Tashu]] when the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]]&ndash;turned&ndash;New Republic operative [[Sinjir Rath Velus]] and [[Gender|his]] friend [[Temmin Wexley]] visited Tashu seeking information on [[Han Solo]] and Imperial fugitives. Windom refused to open the door to Tashu's [[Prison|cell]], citing protocol. However, Sinjir persisted and Windom reluctantly allowed Sinjir to interrogate Tashu. From Tashu, Sinjir learnt about a secret Imperial prison on [[Kashyyyk]] called [[Ashmead's Lock]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nAfter Sinjir and Temmin's team freed the Ashmead's Lock [[prisoner]]s with the help of Han Solo, Windom installed a transponder above [[Hanna City]]'s opera house under orders from [[Fleet]] [[Admiral]] Rax. The liberated rebel prisoners had been implanted with inorganic biochips and were central to Rax's plan to assassinate the New Republic leadership on [[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]]. This transponder was used by Rax to relay signals to the former prisoners who involuntarily met up with Windom. Windom coached the former prisoners for the upcoming attack and equipped them with small, concealed graphene [[blaster]]s. Traducier used his position as a guardsman to position the unwilling assassins near key New Republic officials including [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] and [[General]] [[Crix Madine]] at the [[Old Gather-House]] and [[Senate Plaza (Chandrila)|Senate Plaza]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nOn the eve of Liberation Day, Windom was briefing the former prisoner [[Brentin Lore Wexley]] when his son Temmin discovered them chatting. To prevent discovery of the plot, Traducier ordered Brentin to finish off the intruder. Brentin [[stun]]ned his son and hid him inside a crate. On Liberation Day, the former prisoners received a signal from Rax which caused them to [[Attack on Chandrila|attack]] New Republic officials and [[New Republic Defense Force|military]] [[officer]]s. Chancellor Mothma and [[Commodore]] [[Kyrsta Agate]] were seriously wounded while General Madine and Adviser [[Hostis Ij]] were rumored to have been [[Death|killed]]. The attack derailed the upcoming [[Imperial-Republic peace talks]] with [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]] and set the stage for the [[Battle of Jakku]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWindom managed to [[assassin]]ate the defector [[General]] [[Jylia Shale]] and also freed Yupe Tashu under orders from Fleet Admiral Rax. Later, Windom was captured by the New Republic authorities and imprisoned for his role in the attack on Chandrila. The [[New Republic Security Bureau]]'s investigation discovered that Windom had used a transponder to scramble signals to the inorganic bio-chips inside the heads of the Ashmead's Lock prisoners.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nLater, Sinjir bribed a New Republic guard into allowing him to visit Windom in the interrogation room. Windom taunted the former Imperial that the New Republic was too weak to prevent chaos in [[the galaxy]]. Seeking vengeance on Windom for hurting his friends particularly Temmin and his [[Parent|mother]] [[Norra Wexley]], Sinjir stabbed him with a [[Vibro-knife|vibroknife]] in the sternum. Windom died from his injuries.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nWindom Traducier was a [[Chandrilan]] [[human]] man who had cresting wave of [[Color|blonde]] [[hair]], pale [[eye]]s, and a light scar on his chin. He worked as an undercover Imperial agent and New Republic Senate Guard. Traducier supported the Empire and regarded the New Republic as a \"hobbling, crippled, thing.\" Traducier was a deceptive man who led a double-life and could feign pliability. He was a capable killer who killed former General Jylia Shale and almost killed Temmin. Traducier was familiar with operating technology such as blasters and transponders. Supporting Fleet Admiral Rax's plan to rebuild the Empire, Windom let no remorse for his actions. His arrogance towards Sinjir caused his death.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWindom Traducier first appeared as a minor antagonist in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2016]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', the second instalment in ''[[Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\u30c7\u30e5\u30b7\u30a2\n|pl=Windom Traducier\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0422\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044c\u044e\u0441\u0435\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Traducier, Windom}}\n[[Category:Agents of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Senate Guards]]"}}}]}}}}
