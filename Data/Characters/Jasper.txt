Over the course of a year, he applied three times to join [[Nirama]]'s criminal [[organization]], but had no skills the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] truly needed. He finally got his wish, traveling to the [[Cularin system asteroid belt]] with a handful of other recruits, little suspecting those other recruits were being brought in as spies, with Jasper thrown in to make it look like a legitimate recruiting effort. They all were taken to Nirama's base in a transport piloted by Nirama's minion [[Jobril]].<ref name=\"TW\">''[[TopWorld]]''</ref>\n\nJasper was nervous, so acted like he did not think much of his fellow recruits. Despite this, he answered their questions regarding Nirama and his organization. Jasper was not helpful when the [[Transport/Legends|transport]] came under attack. However, the attack was unfruitful and no-one in the ship was harmed.<ref name=\"TW\" />\n\nOnce the ship reached [[Nirama's public asteroid]], the guards took Jasper to a room, while the other recruits were led to a different one.<ref name=\"TW\" />\n\nDue to his little talents, Jasper was sent to [[Darkside (space station)|Darkside]], an asteroid repair station in the [[Cularin system asteroid belt]]. There, Jasper was approached by the local members of [[The Cell]], a faction wanting to oust Nirama. As they were the first people to show any interest in Jasper, offering him a place and purpose, he decided to join and do his best. The local Cell was not respected in Darkside, being mostly considered a bunch of juvenile delinquents. Extra-planetary Cells were more powerful, but Jasper had no access to information about them.<ref name=\"MW\">''[[MidWorld]]''</ref>\n\nWorking for surviving Cell leaders [[Ahlya]], [[Dor Balse]], [[Kruss Gaal]], [[Jarrilyn]] and [[Michael (Darkside)|Michael]], Jasper was nevertheless relegated to minor tasks, such as trying to recruit some local [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]]. He did have trouble with this, even though he invited them to have dinner several times. During this time, Jasper also became familiar with legends about the [[shadow lurker]]s and was afraid of them, unaware that he was safe.<ref name=\"MW\" />\n\nJasper also tried to recruit more prospective members during a payday, including the people he had traveled with when he joined the Organization. These people were really Nirama's undercover agents trying to capture the local Cell leaders. Jasper's activity led to the capture of at least some of his friends, who were then questioned by Nirama about other Cell members and eventually captured and taken to Nirama.<ref name=\"MW\" />\n\nHis implication in The Cell and subsequent capture were public knowledge less than one month later.<ref name=\"UW\">''[[UnderWorld]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nWhen recruited, Jasper had an over-inflated sense of his own worth, although his only skill was a better-than-normal knowledge of [[Nirama]]'s criminal [[Organization]] and the ability to speak [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]]. Specially when nervous, he was prone to verbally belittle any person he was with.<ref name=\"TW\" />\n\nOnce he had joined the Organization and had been sent to [[Darkside (space station)|Darkside]], he discovered his own insignificance and became more humble. When approached by [[The Cell]], he became infatuated with them, respecting his managers. However, his poor performance did little to impress The Cell, or any other person in Darkside.<ref name=\"MW\" />\n\nJasper was prone to [[motion sickness]] and hated space travel.<ref name=\"TW\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[TopWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[MidWorld]]''\n*''[[UnderWorld]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
