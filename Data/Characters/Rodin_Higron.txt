His base of operations was located on the [[Oasis mining colony]], in [[The Maelstrom]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], Rodin Higron was a crafty [[Gambler/Legends|gambler]] and [[Privateer/Legends|privateer]]. In a particularly crooked game of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]], Higron won sole ownership of an [[oxite]] [[Mining/Legends|mining]] colony on a [[Volcano/Legends|volcanic]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] within [[the Maelstrom]]. The Maelstrom was home to a group of [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] known as the [[Riders of the Maelstrom]], and while investigating the moon, Higron realized that the Malestrom was a perfect hunting ground and established his own group of privateers. However, Higron was a staunch supporter of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], and limited his targets to [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] military and merchant [[Starship/Legends|starships]]. The moon also became the site of an Alliance [[Safe world/Legends|safe world]].<ref name=\"RM\" />\n\nAn unfortunate side effect of this action was that Imperial forces began to tighten their grip on the [[Sector/Legends|sector]], causing a more hazardous operation for the pirate gangs. The leader of the Riders, [[Big Jak Targrim]], became particularly furious with Higron for disrupting their profitable business and tried to crash the [[Luxury liner/Legends|luxury liner]] [[Kuari Princess/Legends|''Kuari Princess'']] into Higron's base of operations. Luckily, a small group of Rebel agents was able to foil Targrim's plan and save Higron's operation.<ref name=\"RM\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Riders of the Maelstrom (West End Games)|''Riders of the Maelstrom'']] {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Classic Adventures: Volume Three|story=Riders of the Maelstrom (West End Games)|stext=Riders of the Maelstrom}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Pirates & Privateers]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Higron, Rodin}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Privateers]]"}}}]}}}}
