Fel has a habit of being too merciful for his own good.|[[Aristocra/Legends|Aristocra]] [[Chaf'orm'bintrano]]|Dark Nest I: The Joiner King}}\n'''[[Commander/Legends|Commander]] Ina'ganet'nuruodo''', also known by the core name '''Ganet''', was a [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] military officer, a lean, sharp-faced woman, no longer young by Chiss standards. Along with [[Chief Navigator]] [[Peita Aabe]], she was one of the leading figures in an attempt to assassinate [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]] in [[28 ABY/Legends|28 ABY]], but she was taken into custody when the attempt failed.\n\nGanet was obviously opposed to [[Assistant Syndic]] Fel, and prepared to undertake extreme action against him. Fel identified her to his [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] companions at the time as the \"phalanx commander for a rival Syndic\", implying that she led either a [[Household Phalanx]] under the authority of one of the [[Ruling Families]], or else a [[Colonial Phalanx]], the militia of one of the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy's]] twenty-eight colony worlds; but she claimed to speak on behalf of the front-line troops of the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]]. Moreover, although the ostensible motive for her attack was an objection to the CEDF's own decision to aid the Jedi in their search for [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]], the Chiss diplomat Aristocra [[Chaf'orm'bintrano]] later implied that more complex factors were at work.\n\nAccording to Formbi, Ganet's attack on Fel represented one of the final moves in a \"disagreement\" amounting to a low-level civil war between two factions among the [[Ruling Families]], in the course of which Fel had already destroyed the lineage to which she belonged. To add to the confusion, Ganet's name would suggest that she was a member of the [[Nuruodo family]], which all other sources have identified as one of the Ruling Families of the victorious faction to which Fel was aligned.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic II: Refugee]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Ina'ganet'nuruodo\n}}\n\n[[Category:Chiss]]\n[[Category:Chiss Expansionary Defense Force officers]]\n[[Category:Csillans]]\n[[Category:Females]]"}}}]}}}}
