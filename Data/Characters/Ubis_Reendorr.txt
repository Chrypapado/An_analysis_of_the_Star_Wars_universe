Go back to the ryll smuggler's bunker and take down Ubis Reendorr.|[[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Lon Cope|Cope]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], underboss Ubis Reendorr was the leader of the [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] smuggling ring of the [[Chirq Council]], best known as the Red Circle Gang.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\" /> The ryll smugglers transported the spice onto Corellia on small ships and unloaded it at a [[Ryll Smuggler Base|bunker]] in the [[Vella plains]] where they refined the spice. Smugglers working under his orders included [[Ladonna Poe]], who served as the contact of the ryll smuggling ring with [[Vuul Sarlin]] and his group of spice dealers in [[Kor Vella/Legends|Kor Vella]],<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|CorSec Case Files: Ryll Smuggling Ring|Corellia}}</ref> as well as [[Jaryn Minoze]] and [[Oret Sturm]].<ref name=\"SWG:SCBftS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Smuggle Civius Bain from the Smugglers|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:UbisReendorr.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ubis Reendorr operating out of his base on Corellia]]\nAt some point, Reendorr was contacted by a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] agent trying to learn the identify of an [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]] by a [[Hologram/Legends|holographic]] image. Reendorr saw it as a chance to settle some of his own business and asked the agent to return a shipment of of [[B1-Series battle droid]]s stolen from him by [[Shalera]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] in exchange. Reendorr did not think the Rebel could get the job done, but the agent succeeded and brought the shipment to him. However, he had learned from the manifests for the shipment, that it was never hijacked and that he, in fact, stole it from the rightful owner. Such detail was no importance for Reendorr, who kept his part of the bargain and provided the Rebel with the identity of the Imperial - [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Andal Sait]] of the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Imperial-class Star Destroyer]] [[Blackguard (Star Destroyer)|''Blackguard'']]. The Rebel needed a fragment of the [[Codex of Tython]] kept by Sait, but had no idea how to get aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]]. Reendorr offered him his help and, for a reasonable payment, smuggled the Rebel aboard inside a cargo container with a shipment of [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]]. He also made sure that the agent would be contacted by Chief [[Engineer/Legends|Engineer]] [[Olum]], whom Reendorr has dealt with before.<ref name=\"LS\">{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ryll_Smuggler_Base.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Ryll Smuggler Base|Ryll Smuggler Bunker]].]]\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the [[Corellian Security Force]] started an investigation against the ryll smuggling ring following the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. A [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] working for [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Lon Cope|Cope]] questioned a spice addict known as [[Menchi Lerann]] and the man revealed that he bought his ryll from Vuul Sarlin. The spacer later interrogated Sarlin who was forced to reveal everything he knew about the ryll smuggling ring, including the location of the Ryll Smuggler Bunker.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> Lieutenant Lon Cope, who has been trying to crack the organization for some time, used his man inside the organization to arrange the meeting between Reendorr and an Alliance operative looking for a large missing shipment of ryll. The two met at a small [[Kor Vella Cantina|cantina]] in Kor Vella, but after the operative had asked Reendorr about the shipment, the Rodian gave the sign to the Red Circle members, who prepared to ask the Rebel some questions in turn - the hard way. The Rebel, however, managed to defeat the thugs and, after he took from Reendorr the access card to the Red Circle bunker, departed.<ref name=\"AoD\" /> CorSec forces finally raided the Ryll Smuggler Bunker. A spacer working for Lieutenant Cope fought and killed underboss Ubis Reendorr. Thanks to Reendorr's access code, the CorSec was able to access the [[Red Circle Base]] nearby.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\" /> The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCTEC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: The Elite Council|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{PAGENAME}} appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CCFTUM\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Agents of Deception|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ubis_Reendorr_(Avatar)_(card).JPG|cardname=Ubis Reendorr}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:The_Unlucky_Mayor_(card).JPG|cardname=The Unlucky Mayor}} {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|CorSec Case Files: The Unlucky Mayor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reendorr, Ubis}}\n[[Category:Chirq Council]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
