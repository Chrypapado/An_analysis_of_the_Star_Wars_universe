Known as Maravada the Silent, Maravada was a philospher and a recluse, and dedicated his time to categorizing and naming the elements of the cosmos. His reign was remembered as a time of peace and learning, which contrasted sharply with that of one of his predecessors [[Avamarivash]]. A history of Maravada's reign could be found in the [[Chamber of Speech]] in Kaleth up until the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]-era and the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order's]] return to Tython.<ref name=\"TheChamberofSpeech\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
