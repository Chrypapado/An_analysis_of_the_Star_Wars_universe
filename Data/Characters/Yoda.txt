Even between the land and the ship.|Yoda, to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\n'''Yoda''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Gender|male]] [[Species|being]] belonging to a [[Yoda's species|mysterious species]], was a legendary [[Jedi Master]] who witnessed the [[Republic Era|rise]] and [[Republic Era|fall]] of the [[Galactic Republic]], followed by the [[Imperial Era|rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Yoda [[Jedi training|trained]] generations of [[Jedi]], ultimately serving as the [[Grand Master]] of the [[Jedi Order]]. Having lived through nine [[Standard century|centuries]] of [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]], he played integral roles in the [[Clone Wars]], the rebirth of the Jedi through [[Luke Skywalker]], and unlocking the path to [[immortality]].\n\n[[Reproduction|Born]] in [[896 BBY]], Yoda was almost nine hundred [[Standard year|years]] old in the latter [[Standard day|days]] of the Republic. A leading member of the [[Jedi High Council]], his contemporaries included other legendary Masters such as [[Mace Windu]] and [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]]. During the [[Invasion of Naboo]] in [[32 BBY]], the maverick [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] introduced [[Anakin Skywalker]] to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied [[Chosen One]]. The Jedi elders sensed that the [[Youngling|boy]] was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the [[Jedi Code]]. After Jinn's [[death]] during the [[Battle of Naboo|liberation]] of [[Naboo]], the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Yoda's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same [[time]], the Jedi discovered that their [[Jedi-Sith War|ancient nemesis]], the [[Sith]], had returned after a [[millennium]] in hiding. Aware of the [[Rule of Two]], Yoda was convinced that at least one more [[Sith Lord]] remained active following [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s victory over the [[Sith apprentice]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]].\n\nOver the next decade, [[the galaxy]] was on the verge of civil war with entire [[star system]]s&mdash;led by [[Count]] [[Dooku]], Yoda's one-time [[Padawan]]&mdash;threatening to [[Separatist Crisis|secede]] from the Republic by [[22 BBY]]. Unable to defend the entire Republic on their own, the Jedi took command of the newly-formed [[Grand Army of the Republic]], with Yoda himself leading an [[army]] of [[clone trooper]]s against the [[Separatist Droid Army]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in the [[First Battle of Geonosis|first battle]] of the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars. For three years Yoda led the [[Republic Military|Republic military's]] war effort as a [[Jedi General]], determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict, but his efforts were undermined by [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] who [[Behavioral modification biochip|conspired]] to [[Order 66|destroy the Jedi]] and [[New Order|restore the Sith]] to power. After the [[Great Jedi Purge]] commenced in [[19 BBY]], killing thousands of Jedi both on [[Coruscant]] and across the galaxy, Yoda [[Duel in the Galactic Senate|confronted]] the [[Proclamation of the New Order|self-declared]] [[Galactic Emperor]] but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into [[Exile (punishment)|exile]], leaving the [[Sith Master]] to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Anakin Skywalker-turned-[[Darth]] Vader, at his side. His remaining years were spent living in [[Hermit|isolation]] on the remote world of [[Dagobah]] until Anakin's [[Skywalker family|son]] [[Luke Skywalker]] sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a [[Jedi Knight]]. A year later, with his health rapidly declining, Yoda died of old age and became [[Force spirit|one with the Force]] in [[4 ABY]], shortly before Luke redeemed his father Anakin, who fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One by killing Sidious.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|For 800 years have I trained Jedi.|Yoda, to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\n[[Reproduction|Born]] nine-hundred [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Endor]],<ref name=\"BioGal17\">{{Databank|yoda-biography-gallery|Yoda Biography Gallery|archivedate=20191016073209}} (Image 17 caption)</ref> Yoda belonged to an ancient and mysterious [[Yoda's species|species]]<ref name=\"Card Trader\" /> and never revealed [[Yoda's homeworld|his homeworld]].<ref name=\"Complete Visual New\" /> As he was [[Force-sensitive|keenly attuned]] to [[the Force]], he joined the [[Jedi Order]] as a [[youngling]].

During the [[Great Hyperspace Disaster]] in the [[Hetzal system]], Jedi Master [[Avar Kriss]] established a [[Force-bond]] [[Avar Kriss's network|network]], which was eventually aided by Jedi who were outside the system.

By the invasion, he had been training Jedi students for about 800 years.<ref name=\"DatabankYoda\" /> In the time before the invasion, Yoda took part in a council meeting. Several hours after that meeting, he took to mediating in a small garden in the temple, only to be interrupted by fellow council member Mace Windu, who, after Yoda waited for him to explain why he wanted a private discussion, expressed his belief that Yoda had sensed something he was keeping private. Yoda repeatedly responded that he sensed nothing. Not understanding but trusting the Grand Master's judgement, Windu excused himself while Yoda, believing the dark side was far away, tried to find what it was that he could not sense. Yoda was unable to uncover the fact that the sensation was caused by the secret plots of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]].<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" />\n\nConcurrent to the Federation's occupation on Naboo, Yoda was present when Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] presented [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young slave [[Gender|boy]] from the planet [[Tatooine]], to the Council in the hopes of training him. Although Jinn believed Skywalker to be the [[Chosen One]], prophesized to bring balance to the Force, Yoda and the other Council members did not share his opinion, sensing that the boy was harboring a high amount of fear and his future was uncertain. They therefore refused to allow for his training.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nAfter Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi returned to Naboo, they forged an alliance between the human inhabitants of the world and the native [[Gungan]] [[species]] in order to combat the Federation occupation forces. The Federation's [[Battle droid|droid army]] was eventually deactivated after Anakin Skywalker accidentally destroyed its command ship. During the battle, however, Jinn and Kenobi dueled a [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] Force user<ref name=\"Episode I\" />&mdash;[[Maul|Darth Maul]], the [[Dathomirian]] [[Zabrak]]<ref name=\"Encyclopedia-Dathomir\">{{SWE|locations|dathomir|Dathomir}}</ref> apprentice of the Sidious&mdash;which cost Jinn his life.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Masters_of_the_Order.jpg|thumb|right|275px|At Jinn's funeral, Yoda and Windu discussed the return of the Sith.]]\nWith the Naboo having waited until the Council's arrival to begin the funeral,<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> Yoda, along with other members of the Council, was present at the Naboo victory parade and Jinn's earlier funeral, where he shared his thoughts on the apparent reemergence of the [[Sith]] with fellow Master of the Order Mace Windu, pointing out<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> that the [[Rule of Two]], the Sith succession system in effect at the time,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia-Sith\">{{SWE|groups|sith|Sith}}</ref> meant that another Sith was still present. Unbeknownst to the two Jedi, the remaining Sith was Sheev Palpatine, the [[Supreme Chancellor]] of the Galactic Republic, who had been sworn in after a [[Vote of No Confidence]] forced his predecessor Valorum to resign.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nYoda<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> and the other Council members remained at the funeral until Jinn's body turned to ash. Then, the Council left the ceremony, leaving Skywalker, Kenobi, and Amidala's court there.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> With Jinn dead, following the events on Naboo, the Council named Jinn's former Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi a [[Jedi Knight]], who informed Yoda of his master's final will&mdash;that Skywalker be trained. Reluctantly, Yoda permitted him to take the boy as his Padawan.

After Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker cornered the assassin, the killer was in turn killed by a mysterious person who escaped using his [[jetpack]]. The events prompted the Council, which included Yoda, to appoint Kenobi to track him down.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nKenobi's investigation led him to attempt to find the planet [[Kamino]], whose location had been missing from the Jedi Archives. This discovery alarmed Yoda, who surmised that only a Jedi could have erased the files. Interrupting a training session with the [[Bear Clan]], Yoda helped Kenobi pinpoint the world's exact location through meditation, allowing the latter to travel there.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nFollowing Kenobi's departure, Yoda experienced a vision while meditating, in which he heard the voice of the [[Force spirit|spirit]] of Qui-Gon Jinn, and sensed that Anakin Skywalker was in terrible pain. He discussed the vision with fellow Master Mace Windu afterwards.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Mace_Yoda_holo.png|thumb|right|275px|Yoda and Windu are informed by Kenobi.]]\nHaving arrived on Kamino, Kenobi reported that the Kaminoan [[Cloning|cloners]] had created a clone army, the order for which had been placed by Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]],<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> who had perished around the time of the Invasion of Naboo.<ref name=\"TCW:TheLostOne\">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref> Kenobi believed that the template used to create the army, [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]], was the person involved in the attack on Amidala. After a brief encounter with Fett, Kenobi followed him to the planet Geonosis, where he found that Dooku's Separatists ordered the assassination attempt on Amidala and had constructed a droid army. After relaying the information to the Jedi Council, Kenobi was captured and scheduled for execution, later joined by Amidala and Anakin Skywalker.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n====Battle of Geonosis====\n{{Quote|The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has.|Master Yoda|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\nNews that Skywalker and Kenobi had been captured prompted the [[Jedi Council|Council]] to dispatch a Jedi strike team to Geonosis, while Yoda headed to Kamino to take command of the clone forces. As a [[clone trooper|clone]] strike team interrupted the execution of Kenobi and his associates, the clones suffered casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Confederate battle droid forces. Yoda led the clones into battle, thus beginning a [[The galaxy|galaxywide]] conflict that would become known as the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Yoda1280.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Yoda duels his former apprentice Dooku on Geonosis.]]\nAs the clones engaged the Confederacy's forces in a massive battle, Yoda headed to rescue Kenobi and Skywalker from Dooku, who had incapacitated the duo in a duel. The diminutive Jedi Master showed his mastery and power over the Force surpassed that of Dooku by casually repelling the latter's telekinetic assault and [[Force lightning]]. He then engaged Dooku in a brief but intense duel, having the upper hand. Dooku, realizing he was outmatched by Yoda, used the Force to bring a large metal pillar down on the unconscious Skywalker and Kenobi, forcing Yoda to break off the duel and use his own powers to stop it from crushing them. Dooku used the distraction to flee aboard his personal craft. Although the battle on Geonosis ended in the Republic's favor, Yoda was concerned about the growing influence of the dark side of the Force and the outcome of the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n====Mentoring Anakin Skywalker====\nAs the Clone Wars progressed, Yoda decided to alleviate Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's fear and inability to lose loved ones by assigning him a Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano. He believed that by becoming a teacher, Skywalker would develop emotionally and that when the time came for Tano to go off on her own, he would understand that his excessive bonding to those he cared about was unnecessary.<ref name=\"DatabankYoda\" /> Tano traveled to the planet of Christophsis, where she presented herself to Skywalker in the midst of a [[Battle of Christophsis|battle]] against Confederate forces.<ref name=\"TCWFilm\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref>\n\nAfter the battle had concluded, Yoda, himself, arrived on the planet and assigned the duo to the task of finding [[Rotta]],<ref name=\"TCWFilm\" /> the son of influential [[Hutt]] crime lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]], who had been kidnapped as part of a plan arranged by his uncle [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] to alienate the Hutts and the Jedi and drag the former into war.<ref name=\"Databank-Rotta\">{{Databank|rotta-the-huttlet|Rotta the Huttlet|archivedate=20200122193703}}</ref> After the two Jedi successfully completed the mission, Yoda, along with a group of clones, extracted them from the planet Tatooine.<ref name=\"TCWFilm\" />\n\n====Ambush on Rugosa====\n{{Dialogue|Ventress|If Yoda is indeed the Jedi warrior you believe he is, let him prove it.

The Jedi then successfully made contact with the Toydarian delegation, prompting Ventress, who was at the king's location, to challenge Yoda: if he could defeat her droid units, Toydaria would join the Republic, but a defeat would result in the planet pledging its allegiance to the Confederacy. The Jedi accepted, and Katuunko requested that he be given a fair fight&mdash;an agreement which Ventress did not intend to honor.<ref name=\"TCW:Ambush\" />\n\n[[File:Yoda_the_great_warrior.png|thumb|left|220px|Yoda destroys a Confederate AAT.]]\nEncountering the droids, Yoda destroyed a squad of them by himself without using his lightsaber, and returned to assist his clone companions, until the arrival of [[droideka]]s forced them to flee. The Jedi covered their escape by deflecting the droids' blaster fire at a nearby rock formation that collapsed and crushed them, after which he and the clones retreated to a nearby cave to rest. In the cave, Yoda relaxed into his natural role as a teacher. Calling each clone by name, he raised their morale by lecturing them on their individuality in the Force.<ref name=\"TCW:Ambush\" />\n\nUpon hearing the sound of more approaching Confederate units, Yoda and his escort left the cave. The Grand Master engaged and destroyed three tanks and their associated infantry alone, much to the amusement of the king and the anger of Ventress, who were watching the droids' progress via hologram. Breaking the terms of the competition, the assassin sent in droidekas to take out Yoda, which the clones prevented by launching their final rocket that caused the enemy to be buried under a rock slide.<ref name=\"TCW:Ambush\" />\n\nKatuunko, impressed by Yoda, decided to join the Republic. As Yoda arrived to meet with the king, he used the Force to stop Ventress from killing Katuunko. When Ventress triggered an avalanche with planted explosives, Yoda saved Katuunko, Thire, Jek, and Rys from being crushed by rocks, maneuvering the debris to the side with the Force. Republic gunships soon arrived to retrieve the group.<ref name=\"TCW:Ambush\" />\n\nBack on the cruiser, Yoda entered a meditation in his cabin. He reached out with the Force to sense the clones he had served with, feeling their differences but sensing the same desires in each of them: to follow orders, win battles, and to be a good soldier. Yoda pondered on the humanity of the clones, deciding that the Republic must understand them as humans, nurturing them instead of treating them like machines. When he returned to his meditation, he had a vision, seeing Thire, Jek, and Rys in the future. Remembering how dangerous the visions of the future were, Yoda ended his meditation, but could not let go of the discomfort of the vision.<ref name=\"L&D\">{{Shortstory|story=Sharing the Same Face|book=The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark}}</ref>\n\n====The ''Malevolence'' crisis====\n[[File:Ahsoka_speaks_out.png|thumb|right|250px|Yoda and Windu confer with Ahsoka Tano, who was adamant on rescuing Koon.]]\nAs the war progressed, the Confederacy developed the ''[[Malevolence]]'', a [[Subjugator-class heavy cruiser|heavy cruiser]] designed to incapacitate and destroy Republic vessels with its<ref name=\"db:malevolence\">{{Databank|malevolence|''Malevolence''|archivedate=20190910044038}}</ref> [[mega-ion cannon]]s,<ref name=\"Rebel Files\">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref> which [[Malevolence campaign|proceeded to destroy]] dozens of ships without leaving survivors.<ref name=\"db:malevolence\" /> The Jedi Council dispatched Jedi Master [[Plo Koon]] to track down the superweapon, but upon locating it, his fleet was ambushed and destroyed by the starship. Although Koon and some clones survived in an escape pod, Yoda, alongside fellow Jedi Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi, forbade Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano to search the system for survivors, citing the threat posed by the ''Malevolence''. Skywalker and Tano, however, disregarded his warnings and successfully rescued Koon.<ref name=\"TCW:RM\">{{TCW|Rising Malevolence|Rising ''Malevolence''}}</ref> The ''Malevolence'' was later destroyed by a concerted Republic assault.<ref name=\"TCW:DM\">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>\n\n====Gunray's capture====\nSome time after the destruction of the ''Malevolence'', Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray was captured by the Republic on the planet of [[Rodia]], but as he was being transported to Coruscant aboard the cruiser ''[[Tranquility]]'' by Jedi Master [[Luminara Unduli]] and Ahsoka Tano, a Separatist boarding party led by Asajj Ventress freed the prisoner.

Yoda and Jedi General [[Aayla Secura]] moved to aid Skywalker, Kenobi, and Windu to recapture the beast. As gunships fired gas bombs in an attempt to pacify the beast, Yoda, Secura, and Skywalker used the Force to prevent themselves and their companions from inhaling the gas. The Zillo Beast was eventually killed by the gas bombs.<ref name=\"ZBSB\">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\n====Attack on the Jedi Temple====\n[[File:Epguide520.png|thumb|left|250px|Ahsoka Tano speaks to the Jedi Council]]\nDuring the peak of the war, [[Barriss Offee]] with the help of [[Letta Turmond]] [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombed the Jedi Temple]] on Coruscant. Yoda then ordered Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to return from [[Cato Neimoidia]] to help investigate, refusing to trust anyone who was in the temple during the bombing. Yoda's judgement was clouded, but he still guided the Jedi as the leader of the Council.<ref name=\"TCW:Sabotage\">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)|Sabotage}}</ref>\n\nTurmond was captured by Skywalker and Tano. In prison, she requested Tano speak with her, saying Tano was the only one she could trust. When Turmond was strangled to death by way of the Force, [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], who was serving as an admiral in the Republic Army, had Tano arrested, accusing her of being the mastermind responsible for the attack. Desperate to prove her innocence, Tano escaped the prison, resulting in a manhunt led by Anakin Skywalker and [[Captain]] [[Rex]]. During the chase, Tano lost her [[Shoto lightsaber]].<ref name=\"TCW:TJWKTM\">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref>\n\nAfter Tano fled to the Underworld, Yoda ordered Skywalker and Plo Koon to track her down and bring her to the Temple, with some resistance from Mace Windu, who felt that Skywalker's emotional connection to Tano would only make things worse. Tano was quickly captured by Asajj Ventress, who agreed to help the young Padawan in exchange for a pardon for Ventress' crimes as a Sith. Tano contacted Barriss Offee at the Jedi Temple. Offee led Tano into a trap by telling her she could find evidence to prove her innocence by going to a warehouse on Level 1315. There, Offee jumped Ventress, stealing her lightsabers and mask. She attacked Tano, knocking her out in front of crates of Nanodroids and effectively framing her for the bombing.<ref name=\"TCW:TCAJ\">{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}}</ref>\n\nTano was then brought back to the Temple, where Yoda and the rest of the Jedi Council reluctantly agreed to expel her from the Jedi Order and have her face a [[Trial of Ahsoka Tano|military tribunal]] before the Senate. Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon and several other Council members were present in the court room, where Tano was prosecuted by Tarkin and defended by Padm\u00e9 Amidala. However, before the jury could render its decision, Skywalker burst in with Barriss Offee, who confessed to being responsible for the bombings and the framing of Tano. In light of this revelation, Yoda, Skywalker and the Council personally invited Tano to rejoin the Order, but to their shock, she refused and left. Yoda would regret the Council's decision and began to question the doctrine of the war.<ref name=\"TCW:The Wrong Jedi\">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>\n\n====Biochip conspiracy====\n[[File:Yoda_Speaking_To_The_Council.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Yoda speaks with the Council about Tup.]]\nPrior to the start of the war, Palpatine and his apprentice, Count Dooku secretly created the Clone Army with the assistance of an unsuspecting [[Sifo-Dyas]], who had seen visions of a conflict beforehand. When this was done, they had organic [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] implanted in their brains. which caused the clones to do anything Palpatine told them to, in this case execute the Jedi. With one simple command, the clones would enter a trance-like state and perform whatever orders they were given.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Ringo Vinda]], clone trooper [[CT-5385|Tup]] murdered Jedi Master [[Tiplar]] when his inhibitor chip was activated prematurely. Sidious ordered Dooku to apprehend Tup to prevent the Jedi from discovering the truth. Tup was eventually sent to Kamino after Anakin Skywalker, Captain Rex and [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC trooper]] [[CT-5555|Fives]] were able to recover Tup from a Separatist Transport.<ref name=\"TCW:The Unknown\">{{TCW|The Unknown}}</ref>\n\nAfter escorting Tup to Kamino, Fives and Rex were greeted by Jedi Master [[Shaak Ti]], alongside the main developer of the clones, Kaminoan scientist [[Nala Se]]. Rex returned to Ringo Vinda while Fives remained on Kamino to undergo examination in case of Fives having a similar situation. Disputes over the tests led to a debate. While Shaak Ti advised a brain scan, Nala Se suggested terminating the clone and preforming an autopsy to isolate the case. Shaak Ti contacted the Jedi Temple where Yoda, alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi, decided Tup should be brought to the temple to be examined through the Force.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\" />\n\nWhat the Jedi were unaware of was that the Kaminoans knew of the inhibitor chips and were working with Count Dooku, who used his Sith name, Tyranus, to prevent the Jedi from making the connection. Dooku ordered that Tup be terminated and that the chip be sent to him to be looked at.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\" />\n\nAngry at Nala Se and Master Ti for their treatment of Tup, Fives escaped the medical center and embarked on his own plan. Fives faked leaving the planet, but stayed to try and save Tup and discover the truth. He and the [[medical droid]] [[AZI-345211896246498721347|AZI-3]] were able to preform a brain scan on Tup, where they learned of the inhibitor chips. Fives had the droid take the chip out of his and Tup's brains. Unfortunately, the already-weakened Tup died soon after the operation, whispering his last words to Fives.<ref name=\"TCW:Conspiracy\" /> Fives blamed Nala Se for what happened to Tup. Suspecting the Kaminoans of treachery, and with the support of Master Ti, Fives insisted on presenting his evidence and the removed chips directly to Palpatine. Fives was eventually brought to Coruscant, at the request of Shaak Ti, where he was brought before the Chancellor. As the ship landed, Nala Se drugged Fives, causing him to act strange.<ref name=\"TCW:Fugitive\">{{TCW|Fugitive}}</ref>\n\nWhen Fives attempted to assassinate Palpatine, Yoda was a part of the Jedi Council that ordered Anakin Skywalker to investigate.

Sending Plo Koon and Commander Wolfe to investigate, they found the remains of a shuttle and the lightsaber of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who was killed sometime around the [[Battle of Naboo]] while dealing with a conflict on [[Felucia]]. Upon reviewing the temple archives, [[Jocasta Nu]] and the Jedi found that the information had been sealed by order of the Supreme Chancellor. While sending Anakin Skywalker and his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to Felucia, Yoda went to speak with Palpatine, not knowing he was the Sith Lord that orchestrated the murder and the creation of the clone army. Palpatine told Yoda to visit [[Finis Valorum|Chancellor Valorum]], as these events had happened before the vote of no confidence that led to Palpatine becoming chancellor. Palpatine then contacted Count Dooku, telling him to destroy the last piece of the puzzle before the Jedi would be able to unravel the mystery.<ref name=\"TCW:TheLostOne\" />\n\n[[File:Valorum_Yoda_The_Lost_One.png|thumb|left|250px|Yoda meets with former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum on Coruscant.]]\nAnakin and Obi-Wan attempted to communicate with the native tribe on the Felucia, but were unable to understand them. They did learn, however, that a second Jedi had shown up with Sifo-Dyas.<ref name=\"TCW:TheLostOne\" />\n\nValorum told Yoda that he had sent Sifo-Dyas to negotiate with the [[Pyke Syndicate]] to stop a booming drug trade underneath Coruscant. Valorum also revealed that he kept this secret, fearing his opponents in the bureaucracy. The talks were postponed after the Council sent Sifo-Dyas to intervene on Felucia. Valorum was unable to identify the second Jedi, but did say that his assistant, [[Silman]], was with Sifo-Dyas when he was shot down.<ref name=\"TCW:TheLostOne\" />\n\nEventually, Yoda dispatched Anakin and Obi-Wan to Oba Diah, where they learned the Pykes were paid to shoot down the ship carrying Sifo-Dyas, but had kept Silman captive as leverage and that Dooku was in fact the individual known as Tyranus, leading them to realize Dooku impersonated Sifo-Dyas to help push forward the Clone Wars. Yoda, not knowing how to stop the plot, suggested the Jedi keep the discovery a secret, and that they should keep playing the Sith Lord's game.<ref name=\"TCW:TheLostOne\" />\n\n====Discovering immortality====\n{{Quote|It is I, Qui-Gon Jinn.''\"<br />\"''That cannot be.

The encounter left Yoda distracted during the subsequent Council gathering, leaving them worried about whether the stresses of the war were finally taking its toll on him. While strolling through the Temple gardens, Yoda was greeted by Anakin. Yoda asked him about his encounter with Qui-Gon's spirit on [[Mortis]], which Anakin had dismissed as a trick, noting the Jedi belief that one could not retain their identity after becoming one with the Force. Yoda responded that he now questioned this dogma.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>\n\nYoda confessed what happened to the Council, much to their disbelief. They agreed though to meditate with him, to verify his experience. Despite meditating together for an entire day, they were unable to hear anything. [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]] expressed worry that Yoda had become susceptible to Sith manipulation, so Yoda underwent medical tests that revealed that he was still in good health. Jedi Doctor [[Rig Nema]] suggested Yoda undergo a [[deprivation ritual]] that would allow him to meditate more strongly and find the source of the voice.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" />\n\nAgreeing, Yoda was suspended in a liquid tank with an [[Breath mask|oxygen mask]] to bring him as close as possible to [[death]] without actually becoming one with the Force. While unconscious, Qui-Gon's voice requested Yoda go to [[Dagobah]], and to tell no one about it. After, Obi-Wan broke open the tank due to his concern over Yoda's failing life signs.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" />\n\nPut on bedrest and under guard, Yoda convinced Anakin to help him escape by posing as simply accompanying each other for a walk. Guided to the Jedi Temple Hangar, Anakin lent Yoda his [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]] to accompany him to his [[Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|personal interceptor]]. Yoda and R2-D2 flew to Dagobah, where Yoda asked the droid to stay with their ship while he found a clearing to meditate.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" />\n\n[[File:YodaDagobahLight.png|thumb|left|250px|Yoda communes with Qui-Gon on Dagobah.]]\nQui-Gon's voice greeted him. Yoda asked why he could not see him. Qui-Gon explained he had not been fully trained enough to do so. The Living Force appeared to Yoda in the form of [[Firefly|fireflies]], guiding Yoda to a [[Cave of Evil|cave]] strong with the dark side, it showed the Jedi Master a vision of the future, where a hooded Sith Lord slaughtered the Jedi. Qui-Gon explained to a distraught Yoda that he would help him bring hope for the future, and directed him to [[Wellspring of Life|the planet]] that spawned the [[midi-chlorian]]s.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" /><ref name=\"Destiny\" />\n\n[[File:YodasDarkSide-Destiny.png|thumb|right|250px|Yoda confronts his own dark side.]]Arriving there, Yoda gave his lightsaber to R2-D2 for safekeeping, and descended into the world to meet the [[Force Priestesses]], who agreed to teach him how to achieve life after death. First, Yoda confronted a manifestation of his own dark side, conquering his hubris. Next, he witnessed a vision of the Jedi massacred in the Temple, where an apparition of a dying Ahsoka Tano asked him if she would still become one with the Force after being expelled from the Jedi Order; this vision was a manifestation of Yoda's guilt over having placed Tano on the path that led to her departure. An apparition of [[Katooni]] then invited Yoda to enter a peaceful courtyard to escape these painful events. Seeing Qui-Gon Jinn, Kenobi, Tano, and Dooku together, alive and full Jedi, Yoda eventually recognized the vision's falsehood, overcoming its temptation and his attachment to those that have fallen.<ref name=\"Destiny\" />\n\nInstructed to complete his tests on the Sith homeworld of [[Moraband]], Yoda and R2-D2 [[Mission to Moraband|flew]] to the [[Valley of the Dark Lords|valley]] where the ancient Sith Lords were buried. Recognizing the danger, Yoda instructed R2-D2 to return to the Jedi Temple and inform the Council of what happened, if he did not come back after three nights. Spectres of a serpent, [[Zombie|undead]] Sith warriors, and even [[Darth Bane]] himself confronted him, but Yoda brushed them off. As he entered a temple [[Moraband execution chamber|execution chamber]], the Force Priestesses warned Yoda that whatever he encountered there would be beyond their control.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\">{{TCW|Sacrifice}}</ref>\n\nUnknown to Yoda, Darth Sidious and Dooku sensed his presence on Moraband, and met in an abandoned tower in the industrial sector of Coruscant. Using Dooku and Yoda's [[Force-bond]], Sidious planned to reach out to Yoda and crush his spirit. Appearing to Yoda in the form of Sifo-Dyas, Sidious had Yoda wake up in a [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|Republic attack gunship]] with Anakin and members of the [[501st Legion]], en route to terminate the Sith on Coruscant. As they arrived, the clones, lead by Captain Rex, rushed at Dooku only to be hit with Sith lightning. Skywalker immediately attacked Dooku while Sidious fled. Walking sadly past the fallen clones, a dismayed Yoda witnessed Skywalker brutally decapitate Dooku. However, he left Skywalker and pursued Sidious.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" />\n\nEmerging out on a catwalk, Yoda and Sidious dueled. Skywalker tried to help, but Sidious knocked him out. Sensing an opportunity, Sidious damaged the catwalk, forcing Yoda to divide his attention between Force-lifting Skywalker to save him from falling to his death and blocking Sidious' Sith lightning. After Sidious taunted him by suggesting he sacrifice Skywalker to concentrate on defeating him, Yoda put down his lightsaber to ensure Skywalker's safety. As the catwalk collapsed, Yoda maneuvered Skywalker to safety and grabbed Sidious, dragging him down too. The incident proved Yoda's selflessness and demonstrated his resolve to Sidious, who concluded the illusion as he realized it would take more to defeat the Jedi Master.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" />\n\nYoda awoke, and was greeted by a Priestess who explained he would continue his training with Qui-Gon's spirit. As she disappeared in a glow of light, Yoda had a vision of the future, including his own death.<ref>{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/sacrifice-episode-gallery|text=Sacrifice Episode Gallery}}</ref> Yoda returned to the Jedi Temple, where Windu and Kenobi greeted him in the garden. Yoda claimed his journey had been uneventful, but felt it had demonstrated the Jedi had been wrong to wage the war on the Republic's behalf.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" />\n\n====Utapau crystal crisis====\nFollowing the death of Master [[Tu-Anh]] on the sinkhole world of [[Utapau]], Yoda and his fellow Jedi Council members sent Master Kenobi and Anakin on a [[Mission to Utapau|mission]] to investigate her death.<ref name=\"TCW:A Death on Utapau\">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref> They discovered that she had been investigating Separatist efforts to excavate and obtain a giant kyber crystal on Utapau. After destroying the crystal and thus denying the Separatists access to the weapon, Yoda was present at a Council meeting when the two Jedi gave a report of the events on Utapau. During the meeting, Yoda recounted how the ancient Sith had constructed superweapons using massive kyber crystals to power them up. He feared that Dooku's mysterious master Darth Sidious had similar intentions.<ref name=\"TCW:The Big Bang\">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref>\n\n====The plan to assassinate Count Dooku====\n{{Quote|One, there is, who has tried and failed.

The Council was reluctant to condone an assassination, but ultimately concluded that killing Dooku was necessary to end the war and prevent more deaths. The Council decided to use Master Quinlan Vos, who had considerable experience with undercover work, to assassinate the Separatist leader. When Vos suggested that a partner accompany him, Yoda recommended Asajj Ventress, Dooku's former [[Sith apprentice]] and a [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] for that mission, knowing her hatred for Dooku. Ventress agreed to assist Vos with his mission but insisted that he had to learn the ways of the dark side.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nDespite their preparation, Vos and Ventress were bested by Dooku and Grievous, who [[Mission to Raxus Secundus|took]] Vos captive. Dooku then managed to bring Vos over to the dark side by revealing that Ventress had [[Battle of unidentified planet (Tholme and Ventress)|murdered]] his late Master, [[Tholme]]. After Vos spurned Ventress' offer to [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|rescue]] him, he became Dooku's newest Sith apprentice and assumed the persona of \"[[Admiral]] Enigma.\" Ventress informed Master Kenobi who conveyed the news to his fellow Council members including Yoda. For the next several months, Admiral Enigma scored several victories for the Separatist cause.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nWhen Vos' old friend [[Akar-Deshu]], a Mahran Jedi, brought Ventress into a Council meeting to discuss rescuing Vos, Yoda and Kenobi spoke up for Ventress when Windu wanted to arrest her. During the proceedings, Yoda and his fellow Jedi learned that Ventress had instructed Vos in the dark side in order to defeat Dooku. While Windu was suspicious of Ventress, Yoda and Kenobi were convinced that she genuinely cared for Vos and that she had rejected the Sith ways for good. After sending Ventress along with Desh and Anakin outside, Yoda and his fellow Jedi debated whether to include Ventress in their rescue mission. When Master Kenobi suggested leading the operation to rescue Vos, Yoda accepted Kenobi's offer and also argued that Ventress was key to the rescue mission. He also recommended that Kenobi take both Ventress and his former Padawan Skywalker along for the mission.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nAfter receiving intelligence from Admiral [[Wullf Yularen]] that Count Dooku and \"Admiral Enigma\" were planning to attack [[Taris]], the Jedi Council decided that they had to move quickly to rescue Quinlan. In the end, the Council decided to offer Ventress a pardon for all her crimes in return for rescuing Vos. The [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|rescue mission]] was a success and the Jedi succeeded in recovering Vos alive. To reward her services, Ventress was formally pardoned. Unknown to Yoda and his colleagues, Vos had become a Separatist double agent in order to gain Dooku's trust so that he could learn the identity of [[Darth]] Sidious and destroy the Sith once and for all.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nUsing his position in the Jedi Order, Vos leaked intelligence about Jedi and Republic [[Destruction of the Separatist supply storage base|military]] [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|operations]] to Count Dooku; allowing the Separatists to undermine these operations. After several Council members voiced their suspicions about Vos' true loyalties, Yoda had a personal meeting with Vos and was able to deduce that Quinlan had fallen to the dark side. To test Vos' loyalties, the Jedi Council sent him to assassinate Dooku, but secretly sent Kenobi and Skywalker to tail him.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nVos managed to defeat Dooku in [[lightsaber combat]], but did not kill him. When Vos demanded that Dooku lead him to Darth Sidious, Kenobi and Skywalker promptly revealed themselves and arrested the two men. After learning of Vos and Dooku's arrest, Master Yoda ordered Kenobi to bring them back to the Jedi Temple where they would be interrogated and executed for their crimes. However, Vos and Dooku escaped with the unwitting help of Ventress, leading to the events of the [[second battle of Christophsis]]. In the end, Ventress helped Vos return to the [[Light side of the Force|light side]], but was killed by Dooku. Kenobi and Skywalker then recaptured Vos and brought him back to Coruscant.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nAfter Vos confessed all his crimes and explained his motivations to destroy the Sith, Yoda and his fellow Council members accepted Vos' repentance as genuine and pardoned him. Kenobi, who believed that the order to assassinate Dooku was morally wrong and responsible for Vos' fall to the dark side, took on the responsibility of monitoring Vos during his rehabilitation. Kenobi accompanied Vos to Dathomir for Ventress' funeral.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n====Last days of the Clone Wars====\n{{Quote|I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

Throughout the course of the war, Palpatine had been granted ever increasing personal authority by the Senate to command both the war and the Republic at large. The Jedi Council, though reluctant to oppose the extremely popular Chancellor, nonetheless grew ever more concerned about the continual centralization of political power in Palpatine.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nAfter a Separatist attack on the Republic capital world of Coruscant by [[General]] [[Grievous]], Skywalker came before Yoda, seeking counsel. He had been experiencing terrifying visions of the death of a loved one, though he did not reveal that the one in question was his secret wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Yoda warned Skywalker to be wary of his visions and of his own feelings, as fear was a path to the dark side, and advised him to \"train himself to let go of everything he feared to lose.\" Skywalker, however, was dissatisfied with this answer, as he could not bear the thought of losing someone he loved. Shortly afterwards, Palpatine, hoping to increase his influence over the Jedi Council and further ingratiate himself with Anakin Skywalker, appointed the young Jedi to be his personal representative on the Council. The Council, having little choice, begrudgingly accepted Palpatine's interference, but refused to grant Skywalker the rank of Jedi Master, infuriating him. Additionally, the Council gave Skywalker the unofficial assignment of spying on Palpatine, an assignment which Skywalker was less than enthusiastic about, as he regarded Palpatine as a friend and a mentor.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Council_RotS.png|thumb|left|275px|Yoda and the Jedi Council discuss the Kashyyyk invasion.]]\nFollowing Skywalker's appointment, the Council chose to take action to avert an imminent Separatist invasion of Kashyyyk. Yoda chose to personally oversee the defense, as he was held in high esteem by the Wookiees. Before leaving for the planet, Yoda discussed with Obi-Wan and Windu about Anakin's assignment. Kenobi expressed his former Padawan's disagreement, and asked if he was not going to fulfill the Prophecy when Windu doubted his abilities. Yoda suggested that it could've been misread, but Obi-Wan believed they would not be let down, which Yoda hoped would be true.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Overlooking_the_Chaos.png|thumb|right|275px|Yoda observing the Battle of Kashyyyk.]]\nOn Kashyyyk, Yoda participated in a holographic session of the Council, where he learned from Skywalker that Republic intelligence located the fugitive General Grievous in the [[Utapau system]]. When Anakin volunteered to lead the campaign, with the stated approval of Palpatine, Yoda and Mace both disagreed, and Yoda nominated Kenobi to be sent instead. Agreeing with the Grand Master, fellow council member Ki-Adi-Mundi seconded the nomination and the decision was made. Yoda left the call and was approached by Commander [[CC-1004|Gree]], who told him that the droids had started their power generators. Yoda ordered his troops to prepare, and soon after the battle began. He observed the battle from above when a shot almost hit him.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nLater, on a meeting with Windu, Anakin, Mundi and Aayla Secura, they were interrupted by Comander Cody, who informed that General Kenobi had engaged Grievous and that the battle had begun on [[Utapau]]. Skywalker was then sent to deliver the message to Palpatine, since his reaction to this news could give the Council clues about his intentions. After Anakin left<ref name=\"Episode III\" />, Mace informed the other Jedi that he felt a plot to destroy the Order, and that the Chancellor was surrounded by the Dark Side. Mundi and Windu suggested to take control over the Senate in case Palpatine did not abide of his emergency powers, though Yoda expressed that this would lead them to a \"dark path\", and that they'd need to be careful.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /><ref name=\"Shattered\">{{TCW|Shattered}}</ref>\n\nRight afterwards, Ahsoka Tano and Commander Rex joined the call. She revealed that they succesfully [[Siege of Mandalore|captured]] Maul on Mandalore and that he'd be delivered to Coruscant by them, which Yoda considered a great service. Ahsoka stated she did her duty as a citizen, but when Yoda asked if it was not as a Jedi, she simply said that \"not yet\". Tano wanted to speak with Skywalker, but since he had left, Windu and Yoda explained Obi-Wan's situation to her. When she realized the war could end soon, Mace retorted that it would depend on Palpatine, but refused to explain more to her, which did not sit well with Yoda. As the members of the call left, Yoda stayed and asked Ahsoka if she had anything else to say, and after a brief silence, she confirmed she'd tell the information to Anakin himself. Yoda then said \"May the Force be with you, Padawan.\" and ended his transmission.<ref name=\"Shattered\" />\n\nAs the battle on Kashyyyk continued, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine revealed his true identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, turned Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force, and defeated a group of Jedi Council members who had come to arrest him. When Sidious bestowed the name of Darth Vader to Skywalker, Yoda felt the moment through the Force.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Order 66====\n{{Quote|How many other Jedi have managed to survive?''\"<br>\"''Heard from no one have we.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, after Order 66|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\nChristening his newfound apprentice Darth Vader, Sidious sent him and the 501st Attack Battalion to attack the Jedi temple and slaughter all who resided there.

He then proceeded to escape with the help of the Wookiees [[Chewbacca]] and [[Tarfful]], rendezvousing with Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had escaped death on Utapau.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Pg3_saber_bg.jpg|thumb|right|250x250px|Yoda fights the 501st troopers guarding the Jedi Temple.]]\nThe two Jedi discussed their situation, during which Bail and Yoda informed Kenobi that the Temple was broadcasting a coded retreat message, ordering all surviving Jedi to return to Coruscant. Yoda and Kenobi decided to return to the Temple and reconfigure the beacon to warn any survivors to go into hiding, and to that end Bail took them to Coruscant. The two Jedi fought their way in and witnessed the effects of the rampage by Vader and his clone unit, including the visible lightsaber cuts on several dead clones. In the meantime, Sidious, as Palpatine, reforms the Republic into the first Galactic Empire with himself as its Emperor. That was the beginning of the Age of the Empire.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n===The Age of the Empire===\n====Duel in the Senate====\n{{Quote|I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend&hellip; at last, the Jedi are no more.''\"<br />\"''Not if anything to say about it, I have!

Yoda, aware that watching recordings of their fellow Jedi being slaughtered would cause Kenobi pain, cautioned him before the younger Jedi activated the security recordings. The duo thus learned of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side, his Sith title of Darth Vader, Palpatine's Sith identity and the formation of the [[Galactic Empire]] from the Republic. Agreeing that the two Sith had to be destroyed, Yoda headed to the Galactic Senate to confront the Emperor, while a deeply reluctant Kenobi departed to the volcanic planet of [[Mustafar]] to face his former apprentice.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:YodaDuel.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Yoda battling Darth Sidious in the Senate chamber.]]\nUpon arriving into the [[Chancellery Secretariat]], Yoda confronted the Emperor, who surprised the Jedi and rendered him unconscious with a burst of Force lightning. As Sidious boasted how he came to eradicate the Jedi Order, Yoda managed to wake up and slammed his opponent into a wall. The duo then drew their lightsabers and engaged in a fierce duel that soon continued into the central auditorium of the Senate Building. Briefly separated from Yoda, Sidious launched the numerous Senate hoverpods at his opponent, but the Jedi nevertheless managed to catch up with him, engaging him at close quarters again with his lightsaber drawn. Sidious then blasted Yoda with a burst of Force lightning which tore Yoda's lightsaber from his hand but which the Jedi proceeded to successfully deflect with his bare palms; the buildup of energy subsequently triggered an explosion that blew both combatants apart and caused Yoda to fall to the bottom of the chamber while Sidious was thrown out of the pod but managed to barely hold on to one of its guardrails, gaining the high ground. Realizing he was defeated, Yoda fled through the maintenance tunnels of the building and contacted Organa to rescue him via his airspeeder, considering the duel his personal failure and voicing his intent to go into self-imposed exile.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Exile====\n{{Quote|Into exile I must go.

Obi-Wan Kenobi, having defeated but not killed Vader on Mustafar, arrived soon thereafter, bringing with him the dying Senator Amidala. She gave birth to her twins from Anakin Skywalker and named them Luke and Leia before her death.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nSensing the children's power in the Force, Yoda, Kenobi and Organa decided to keep them hidden in unsuspecting locations to avoid detection by the Empire; [[Luke Skywalker]] was delivered to the Lars family on Tatooine, while Organa personally adopted his sister, Leia. As the trio prepared to go their separate ways, Yoda asked Kenobi for a moment of his time. He revealed that he had training for him during his solitude on Tatooine, and that Qui-Gon Jinn had reached the path to [[immortality]], having returned from the [[Netherworld of the Force]]. Yoda decided he would teach Kenobi to communicate with Jinn.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:YodaLandsonDagobah.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Yoda lands on the planet Dagobah, his home for the rest of his life.]]\nUsing an [[E3-standard starship lifeboat]], Yoda returned to Dagobah to begin his own exile. The lifeboat served as Yoda's initial shelter but it started to degrade within a year due to Dagobah's [[swamp]]y environment. As the first shelter was slowly consumed by the swamp, Yoda built a new [[Yoda's Hut|home]] for himself.

Despite her young age, the child proved to be wise, and Tano was upset that Fardi would likely never be able to prove her wisdom to Yoda. Later, while sleeping aboard the [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]'' after Organa offered her a chance to join his [[Bail Organa's resistance movement|rebellion]], Tano remembered Yoda's advice to her when she was getting her first kyber crystal.

Approximately four years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Yoda spoke to Kanan Jarrus, who had been the Padawan of [[Depa Billaba]] and a survivor of Order 66.<ref name=\"K:TLP1\">[[Kanan 1|''Kanan'' 1]]</ref><ref name=\"K:TLP2\">[[Kanan 2|''Kanan'' 2]]</ref> Jarrus had traveled to the [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] on the planet [[Lothal]] with his own Padawan, [[Ezra Bridger]], to whom Yoda also spoke. Bridger was in the temple in order to overcome his greatest fears; Yoda acted as an anonymous guide in helping Bridger do so and to understand why he wanted to become a Jedi and how to withdraw from the anger and the wish of revenge within him. This guidance led Bridger to receive a kyber crystal, which he used to build his [[Ezra Bridger's lightsaber|own lightsaber]]. Meanwhile, Yoda counseled Jarrus about Jarrus' insecurities as a teacher.<ref name=\"POTJ\">{{Rebels|Path of the Jedi}}</ref>\n\nThe year after, Jarrus and Bridger returned to the Lothal Temple with Ahsoka Tano in search of a way to defeat the Inquisitorius. Yoda cast an illusion of the [[Jedi Temple Guard]] for Jarrus, including [[the Grand Inquisitor]] as he was before the Jedi Purge. The Inquisitor forced Jarrus to recognize his fears and [[Knighting ceremony|knighted]] him a true Jedi. Meanwhile, Bridger pleaded with Yoda for help: despite his pacifism, the Jedi Master ultimately directed him to go to [[Malachor]]. When the [[Fifth Brother|other]] [[Seventh Sister|Inquisitors]] arrived, Yoda used the Temple Guard to distract them as the Jedi escaped.

Yoda was not upset about this, because dry was the season he preferred, as the high lands he stayed in during the wet season reminded him of the Jedi Temple and his failings. The rains had ended and now the lowlands could be arable. Due to his reliance on his cane, He realized how age had affected him. He had originally used his walking stick as a joke on the padawans, but now he realized he truly needed it. He packed what little he owned in his hut and left. Before he left, he checked for the Imperial [[Viper probe droid|probe droids]] which had once searched for him endlessly.<ref name=\"FACPOV\">{{Shortstory|story=There is Another|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\nAs he descended farther downhill, he felt a certain presence. He then realized that it was neither a probe droid nor one of the Empire's ships. It was Obi-Wan. As Yoda felt vibrations of the force from Kenobi and the last remains of Anakin, a [[Viper probe droid|probe droid]] arrived. Yoda quickly took out a pot given to him by Kenobi, using the force to smash it into the droid. Suddenly, however, he sensed Kenobi's death at the hands of Vader. With the Jedi distracted, two more droids arrived, but Yoda force crushed both of them. He then carefully sensed the environment around him and confirmed there were no more.<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\nYoda continued down the hill, until he reached his lowland hut. It had survived its hibernation, but, as ever, was dripping and spongy. Five days later, Yoda had dried and cleaned the house. Every time he saw the shelf he usually put his pot, he felt a bit of loneliness after destroying Obi-Wan's gift to him. Lonely, he reached out to the Netherworld of the force and called Qui-Gon, but Obi-Wan, his spirit having survived death, answered instead. Obi-Wan then began to ask Yoda to take on a final padawan. Yoda did not want to train the young boy as he sensed great recklessness in him and feared he would fall to the Dark Side. Yoda insisted on training young Leia, but Obi-Wan insisted on Luke.<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\n====Taking a new apprentice====\n{{Quote|Do, or do not.

He also harbored regrets about having not taken Anakin Skywalker's daughter as his apprentice. However, he was not confident that he had enough time left to teach another pupil. After Obi-Wan Kenobi was killed, he reached out to Yoda from the netherworld of the Force and requested that Skywalker's child be trained. The Jedi Master readily agreed until he found out that Kenobi was actually speaking of Anakin's unfocused son instead. Nevertheless, Yoda begrudgingly allowed Kenobi to direct the boy to him.<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\nLuke Skywalker, under guidance from the spirit of Kenobi who had served as his mentor,<ref name=\"A New Hope\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> sought Yoda in his Dagobah exile to receive Jedi training<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> three years later.<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\" />\n\nAt the same time, Yoda, stirred awake by the feeling of the Dark Side and the memories of his trauma years ago, went to his storage area to find it empty. In an effort to find food, he made the arduous trek across the wild terrain of Dagobah. Eventually, Yoda made it to a valley, full of colorful creatures, and another [[Unidentified quadruped|species]] in particular. Herds of these creatures ran through this valley, the best source of meat Yoda had yet been able to find. Years ago, Yoda had decided to give up his lightsaber, promising to never wield one again, taking a [[bow]] instead. To get what he came for, Yoda readied his bow and took aim of one of the creatures, easily killing it with one shot of the bow. On his journey back, Yoda began to feel the ground shift beneath his feet, beginning to crumble as Yoda began to fall. At the last moment, Yoda grabbed onto the side, reflecting on the similarities of this moment to his duel with Darth Sidious many years ago. Yoda's grip failed and he falls onto the ground below as boulders began to pile on top of him. Yoda fell unconscious.<ref name=\"Special 1\">{{Shortstory|story=The Trial of Dagobah|book=Age of Rebellion Special 1|bformatted=''Age of Rebellion Special'' 1|manual=1}}</ref>\n\nYoda began to dream, the dream of pain, suffering, anger, hate, and suddenly, he awoke once again. Realizing the predicament he was in, Yoda began to laugh, laughing at his foolishness for allowing him to get into this situation. He began to doubt himself, thinking of how he was now trapped on Dagobah, but subsiding those feelings, knowing he is one of the last of the Jedi. He reached out to the Force and, in that moment, he realized why he had failed in the past. His shame, his hubris, his blindness, they had all clouded his vision and realized his failings as a Jedi. However, he knew that failure was the greatest lesson a Jedi could learn, and understanding this brought him peace. With this newfound peace, Yoda was given the power to move the boulders resting on top of him. With a newfound sense of responsibility and understanding, Yoda began his journey home.<ref name=\"Special 1\" />\n\nArriving back at his home, Yoda began to cook a stew, when he began to hear a crashing in the [[tree]]s surrounding his hut. A visitor had arrived. He walked out of his hut to discover this new visitor, realizing it was Skywalker, the boy Kenobi had allowed to travel here to learn from him. As he stares at Skywalker from the trees, he came to the realization that he would not be the last Jedi, but only the instrument as to train the future.<ref name=\"Special 1\" />\n\nWalking out, he decided to test the boy and did not reveal his true identity, instead promising to lead him to Yoda; Skywalker's subsequent frustration and his age made the Jedi doubtful as to whether it was a good idea to train the boy, but Kenobi's spirit managed to convince him to do so.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nYoda proceeded to tutor Skywalker with a variety of exercises, including the telekinetic manipulation of objects in the area. As part of his training, he also sent Skywalker into a nearby cave, which was powerful with the dark side in order to demonstrate the dangers of falling to the dark side of the Force. During his tenure with Yoda, Skywalker sensed that his friends were in danger in [[Cloud City]] on the [[gas giant]] Bespin, and headed there to confront Darth Vader in spite of Yoda's and Kenobi's persuasion to the contrary. Although Kenobi was distraught by Skywalker's rushed departure, Yoda reminded him that there was still another offspring of Anakin Skywalker<ref name=\"Episode V\" />&mdash;Leia Organa.<ref name=\"Episode VI\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref>\n\n====Death====\n{{Quote|Luke... when gone am I, the last of the Jedi, will you be.

Yoda also said that when he dies, Luke will become the last of the Jedi. Therefore, he wanted Luke to pass on what he had learned.

In fact, unbeknownst to Luke, Rey had already taken the [[Sacred Jedi texts]] when she left. During their meeting, Yoda pointed out that mistakes and failure were important lessons, if not the most important lesson, for a Jedi Master. Ultimately, Yoda helped Skywalker come to terms with his failed training of [[Ben Solo]], and to realize that despite his fear of failing another student he could still be what Rey needed.

Even if all Yoda did was wait for the student to catch up to speed, he found that they almost always realized what they needed. When Master Mace Windu questioned whether Yoda had sensed something or not, he waited until the younger Jedi realized he was sensing nothing. Windu remained confused, forcing him to explain that the feeling of nothing needed to be caused by something. He disagreed with Windu's sentiment that \"nothing\" and \"something\" were always opposites, and he made sure to never be fully sure of himself, knowing there was more to learn.

As such, he took teasing his fellow council member, once asking if he had arrived for a private discussion because he had embarrassing questions, which Windu denied instantly. Afterward, he elected to wait to speak, wanting Windu to begin the discussion and viewing it as him cracking as if he was under pressure. Windu also found Yoda's behaviors distracting, yet he would always trust the older Jedi's judgement.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\" /> His sense of humor continued with others, as shown when he playfully rummaged through Luke's belongings when he first met him, fought R2-D2 for a torch,<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> and laughed gleefully when he supposedly set the ancient Jedi texts on fire, and finding Luke's continued ignorance amusing, commenting that he had \"missed him.\"<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Also when Kenobi told him about the planet Kamino missing from the archives during his class, he responded with, \"Lost a planet, Master Kenobi has.

He was even able to blast Darth Sidious himself through the air with a Force Push and was able to stop and redirect a Senate hoverpod Sidious had thrown at him when they fought in the Senate building. During a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa, Yoda effortlessly pulled 2 droids to slash them with his lightsaber, flung multiple pieces of the droid controlling one of the infantry high into the air and both opened the upper parts of another infantry tank and send it and the droid controlling it into the air. After the droids were dealt with, Yoda easily overpowered the powerful Sith Assassin [[Asajj Ventress]] with telekinesis, stopping her lightsaber strike mid-way and disarming her with a simple gesture, and repulsed the many stones caused by Ventress activating an explosion.<ref name=\"TCW:Ambush\" /> In order to teach Luke Skywalker that anything was possible with the Force, Yoda levitated his student's sunken [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] out of a swamp of Dagobah and onto dry land with no visible strain.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Yoda could also stop strikes from [[giants of living stone]].<ref name=\"SW 30\" />\n\nJedi Padawan [[Bell Zettifar]] pondered whether Yoda&mdash;after putting great focus into the effort&mdash;could use the Force to stop gravity.<ref name=\"Light of the Jedi\" /> In his duel with both Sith Lords Count Dooku and Darth Sidious, Yoda displayed great proficiency in [[Force deflection|Force Deflection]], as he was able to easily stop and then redirect Dooku's Force lightning attack with his bare hands and even managed to stop Sidious' Force lightning attack using just his palms but was unable to deflect it completely: the energy eventually exploded and flung both of the combatants away from each other, ending the duel in a stalemate and causing Yoda to escape.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Yodasforcedeflection.png|thumb|right|300px|Yoda was capable of absorbing and deflecting Force lightning with his palms.]]\nHis ability to use the combative applications of the Force notwithstanding, Yoda's incredibly strong connection to the Force combined with his years of extensive study also granted him numerous supplementary abilities. During the trial of [[Quinlan Vos]], Yoda revealed that he could uncover the alignment of a Force-user just by touching them\u2014stating that the Force had permitted him to read the history of a soul, able to easily sense that he had fallen to the Dark Side despite Vos being proficient enough to hide it from many other Jedi.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" /> While physically isolated on Dagobah, Yoda was able to see other Jedi that were active in the Force; he could not see one that had forsaken the ways of the Jedi.<ref name=\"Video\">{{SW|url=video/star-wars-rebels-meet-kanan-the-cowboy-jedi|text=Kanan, the Cowboy Jedi}}</ref> He could keep in mental contact with the Jedi Temples across the galaxy, and telepathically converse with any Jedi within them.<ref name=\"POTJ\" /> He also was able to fully master the skill of maintaining consciousness after death, something that Qui-Gon Jinn was unable to do, allowing him to manifest a visible presence rather than simply being a disembodied voice.  Additionally, Yoda was able to use [[Force healing]], even to the extent of healing himself and those around him while in battle with just a wave of his hand.<ref>[[Star Wars Battlefront II]] </ref>\n\nYoda was also shown to be capable of experiencing Force visions. However, he understood that Force prophecy was not absolute and that the future was always in motion.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> His visions led him to foresee the fall of the Jedi in the Clone Wars and even his own death.<ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" />\n\nAs a Force spirit, Yoda was evidently capable of either manipulating weather to create lightning strikes, or summoning such strikes himself. He was also shown to be capable of striking Luke Skywalker with his walking stick, demonstrating an ability to interact with the living world in a physical sense despite both Yoda and the stick being ostensibly non-corporeal.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n===Other skills===\nYoda was also shown to have a level of proficiency in piloting despite often leaving it to his soldiers, as when he was forced to travel alone by Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda displayed the ability to pilot Anakin's personal interceptor comfortably and was able to avoid inflicting any damage on it until he returned to the Jedi.<ref name=\"TCW:Voices\" /><ref name=\"Destiny\" /><ref name=\"TCW:Sacrifice\" /> Sidious and Yoda were equally matched during their duel in the Galactic Senate.<ref name=\"Complete Visual New\" />\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Yoda proved himself to be an exceptional strategist and leader, being a highly effective general. His abilities in those regard were displayed during a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa: Yoda was able to inspire hope into his troopers despite the overwhelming odds and was able to easily tactically defeat the army of droids, exploiting the weak-points of the infantry tanks to systematically destroy them and at one point tricking one of the droids controlling the tanks into destroying the other tank.<ref name=\"TCW:Ambush\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nThroughout the Republic Era, Yoda wielded his own lightsaber. He is also known for using a cane. It began as a lesson, but really more of a joke, for his Padawans; he would limp into a room with the cane, then he would cast it aside and quickly use his speed in the Force, only to finally grab the cane once more and hobble away. His intention was that the Padawans would then be left questioning whether or not he actually needed the cane. Nevertheless, as he grew older during his exile on Dagobah, he found he truly had come to need it.<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|The idea of using another person, perhaps an alien, for Luke to play off of came up during story meetings. George Lucas and Leigh Brackett thought that the alien could be an Indian desert type, very childlike even though he's an old man. He at first should be repulsive and slimy but then should become kind and wise. He appears as a crazy little nitwit that goes around scurrying like a rat but ultimately teaches Luke a great deal about the Force.|[[Laurent Bouzereau]] about Yoda's development for Episode V|Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays}}\n[[File:Grand_Old_Wizard.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Early concept art by [[Joe Johnston]].]]\nOriginally named \"Minch Yoda\" before it was shortened to simply Yoda,<ref name=\"DB:Yoda\">{{DB|character|yoda|Yoda|archivedate=20110911123202}}</ref> the character made his first appearance in the [[1980]] film [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], and subsequently appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], the closing installment of the original trilogy. He was also featured in all three episodes of the prequel trilogy, and multiple episodes of the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' animated television series. Yoda also played a role in various Expanded Universe material now under the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] brand and thus [[Canon|non-canonical]].<ref name=\"canon\">{{SW|url=news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|text=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page}}</ref>\n\nMany of the information and training that Yoda gave to Luke on Dagobah was originally going to be given by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]], but due to Kenobi's death in ''A New Hope'', [[George Lucas]] conceived Yoda to fulfill the role of Luke's teacher after Kenobi's death.<ref name=\"FStJ: TMoS\">''[[From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga]]''</ref> Early concepts of Yoda imagined him as a large alien before he was reimplemented as a tiny one, with various gnome&ndash; and elfin-like portrayals being created by the design team of Episode V.<ref name=\"DB:Yoda\" />\n\nOnce Yoda's appearance was finalized, make-up and creatures supervisor [[Stuart Freeborn]] created a detailed puppet, brought to life on screen by [[Frank Oz]]. A new model, younger in appearance, was built by [[Nick Dudman]]'s animatronics crew for the filming of Episode I, in which Yoda also appeared as a CGI model for two shots' duration. In Episode II, Yoda's character was realized entirely through computer-generated imagery, partly due to the practical necessity imposed by the action scenes of Yoda's duel with Dooku, and partly due to the determination of Animation Director [[Rob Coleman]]. Designed specifically to not exceed Oz's puppetwork in realism, the animated version of Yoda was accepted after several shots from ''Empire Strikes Back'' were recreated using the new technology as animation tests and evaluated.<ref name=\"DB:Yoda\" />\n\n[[File:YodaCharacterStudies.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Character studies of Yoda created for ''The Clone Wars'' episode \"[[Ambush]].\"]]\nYoda's ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' incarnation was voiced by veteran ''Star Wars'' voice actor [[Tom Kane]].<ref name=\"Kane-Interview\">{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/news20081003b.html|archivedate=20110816173325|text=Tom Kane: Mastering Yoda}}</ref> During the ''Revenge of the Sith'' DVD press conference in [[2005]], Oz initially mentioned that he was going to be involved in the series, but in a [[2007]] interview with Aintitcoolnews.com he eventually denied any involvement.<ref name=\"Hyperspace\">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/audiocast/audio/SW_dvdpressevent_03_2005-10-10.mp3|text=DVD Press Event}}</ref> In spite of this, Oz later returned to voice the character in ''Star Wars Rebels''.\n\nOz continued to perform as Yoda in all three films of the [[sequel trilogy]]: the [[2015]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']],<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/12/20/jj-abrams-reveals-obi-wan-and-yoda-are-star-wars-force-awakens/|title=J.J.

It's not only a puppet, it's an exact replica of the ''Empire'' puppet. They found the original molds for it. They found the woman that painted the original eyes for Yoda.
