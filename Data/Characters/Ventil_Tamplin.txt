In fact, they were right and Laughlin was actually working for the CorSec. During the CorSec investigation against the criminal organization known as the [[Chirq Council]], [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vitala Baize]] needed information from Lilith Laughlin. She thus dispatched an agent to deal with her Ragtag problem. The CorSec agent fought the Ragtag cudgels who bothered the informant and killed some of them, including Ventil Tamplin.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCSC\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVentil Tamplin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TCCSC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Chirq Council: Seek Council}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tamplin, Ventil}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Kajain'sa'Nikto]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
