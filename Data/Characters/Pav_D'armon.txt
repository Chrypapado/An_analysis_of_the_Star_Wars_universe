After Kellering's groundcar was ambushed at the gates, the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]] turned on Pav, and quickly gunned her down.\n\nIt seems almost certain that both Manda D'ulin and Pav D'armon were killed in the attack, but the ambush prompted Shada and the rest of the team to launch an unplanned but very effective counterattack, determined to show the Empire that Mistryl could not be simply shot in cold blood.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Hammertong: The Tale of the \"Tonnika Sisters\"]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Pav D'armon\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:D'armon, Pav}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mistryl]]"}}}]}}}}
