He later joined the [[Alderaan Flotilla]], a collection of [[starship]]s housing the surviving [[Alderaanian]] population, and worked with [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of Alderaan and the [[Rebel pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] to lobby for the remains of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]] to be given to the flotilla. In [[5 ABY]], he attended a meeting to discuss the future of the flotilla, where an argument broke out about whether the flotilla should remain in the [[Alderaan system]] or resettle a new world. The argument was interrupted by the surprise arrival of the Death Star wreckage, which Gale hoped they could use to build a [[space station]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|It's a gift from our princess.
