He played [[Net-ball]], and was once engaged to [[Bria Tharen]]. Tharen's [[Sera Tharen|mother]] had been pushing them together for years, but Bria broke up with Dael when she found out he was cheating on her. Their [[Marriage/Legends|wedding]] was called off, much to Sera Tharen's disgust.\n\nLater, when Bria returned to Corellia with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], Levare recognized Han and called him Tallus Bryne, an alias Solo had once used while involved in a con, forcing the couple to leave Corellia. Levare had also watched Han win the Corellian swoop championship and was a big fan. At this time Dael Levare was in a new relationship with [[Sulen Belos]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dael Levare\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Levare, Dael}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
