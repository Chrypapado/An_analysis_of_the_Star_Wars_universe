Reuther was also a retired [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] and speaker of [[Olys Corellisi|Old Corellian]] and was familiar with several [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] customs. When [[Adalric Cessius Brandl]] came to Najiba, Reuther witnessed Brandl wielding [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to terrorize the denizens of his bar. Brandl was seeking passage to [[Trulalis]], but it was illegal to fly when the [[Children of Najiba]] were near the planet which they conveniently were. Not wishing harm to the local Najibans, Reuther went to find a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] to take Brandl off-world. Reuther found [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Thaddeus Ross]], an old Corellian friend. Thaddeus agreed to take Brandl away from Najiba, and the two departed in his ship, the ''[[Kierra]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|4|The Final Exit}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=The Final Exit}}\n*{{Journal|15|Laughter After Dark (short story)|Laughter After Dark}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|13|Alien Encounters (article series)|Alien Encounters}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Reuther\n|es=Reuther\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Najiba residents]]\n[[Category:Najibs]]"}}}]}}}}
