The book also places the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] in the same year. ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the plot to [[22 BBY]], therefore it can be deduced 7955 C.R.C. is equivalent to [[Galactic standard calendar|22 BBY]]. From this, we can calculate Dannl Faytonni's [[Reproduction|birth]] to [[76 BBY]].</ref>\n|death=\n|species=[[Human]]<ref name=\"aotc\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> {{C|[[Corellian]]}}<ref name=\"Helmet Collection 39\" />\n|gender=[[Gender|Male]]<ref name=\"aotc\" />\n|height=1.75 [[meter]]s<ref name=\"Scum and Villainy Case Files\">''[[Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious]]''</ref>\n|mass=\n|hair=[[Color|Gray]]<ref name=\"aotc\" />\n|eyes=Blue<ref name=\"aotc\" />\n|skin=Light<ref name=\"aotc\" />\n|cyber=\n|affiliation=\n|masters=\n|apprentices=}}\n'''Dannl Faytonni''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[human]] and a known associate of [[Achk Med-Beq]].<ref name=\"CL 2016\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> The two were present in the [[Outlander Club]] on [[Coruscant]]<ref name=\"aotc\" /> in [[22 BBY]]<ref name=\"Dates\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of ''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'' and [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] to [[22 BBY|22]] and [[19 BBY]] respectively.</ref> when the [[Clawdite]] [[assassin]] [[Zam Wesell]] [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|attempted]] to hide there to escape the pursuing [[Jedi]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]].<ref name=\"aotc\" /> By the [[time]] Kenobi and Skywalker were assisting Wesell at the back of the establishment, Faytonni and Med-Beq were patrolling the second floor of the Outlander conjuring.<ref name=\"CL 2016\" />\n\n[[19 BBY|Three years later]],<ref name=\"Dates\" /> Faytonni attended the [[Galaxies Opera House]] the same night Skywalker met with [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]].<ref name=\"rots\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDannl Faytonni had [[Color|gray]] [[hair]], blue [[eye]]s, and light skin.<ref name=\"aotc\" /> He was a known [[con artist]] who sometimes wore fake military gear to disguise himself.<ref name=\"Complete Visual New\">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDannl Faytonni first appeared in the [[2002]] film [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] and was portrayed by ''[[Star Wars]]'' veteran [[Anthony Daniels]], the actor who also played [[C-3PO]].<ref name=\"aotc\" /> Faytonni was later identified in the [[2016]] [[canon]] reference book [[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']].<ref name=\"CL 2016\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']] {{1stID|Dannl Faytonni}}\n*{{InsiderCite|Special Edition 2018|Red Five (Star Wars Insider)|Red Five}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|39|Weapons & Uniforms|The Outlander Club}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga: The Official Collector's Edition]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Dannl Faytonni\n|ka=\u10d3\u10d4\u10dc\u10da \u10e4\u10d4\u10d8\u10e2\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Faytonni, Dannl}}\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
