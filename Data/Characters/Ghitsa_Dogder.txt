She had short, spiked blonde [[Hair/Legends|hair]], was self-described as having a great fashion sense, and had a tendency towards wearing outfits with large shoulder pads.\n\n==Biography==\nGhitsa spent several years working as a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Hutt counselor|counselor]] for the [[Besadii/Legends|Besadii]] [[Kajidic/Legends|kajidic]], negotiating multimillion [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] deals on behalf of the clan.\n\nGrowing tired of service to the Hutts and wishing to avoid the lethal end that claimed most counselors, she devised an elaborate scheme in [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]] involving [[Mistryl Shadow Guard|Mistryls]] [[Shada D'ukal]] and [[Dunc T'racen]] by which she maneuvered [[Durga Besadii Tai|Durga the Hutt]] into dismissing her from his employ, while collecting a hefty payoff in the process. Although no longer officially connected to the [[Hutt Empire]], she still had an insider's knowledge of the organization.\n\nWhile posing as a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] (a recurring con in Ghitsa's repertoire) in [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]] on the planet [[Prishardia]], she was kidnapped by [[Desilijic/Legends|Desilijic]] representatives seeking information about one of Durga's operations. She was beaten and questioned, but having been several years since her service to the Hutts, she had no knowledge of this recent venture. A timely rescue from the kidnappers' ship, the [[Rook (Class 720 freighter)|''Rook'']], by Fen and the young [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Kyp Durron]] (acting under the name [[Zeth Fost]]) prevented her demise.\n\nGhits and Fen returned Kyp to the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], where Kyp, who had earlier indicated that [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] had directed him to Prishardia, hinting that Ghitsa may have Force sensitivity. Ghitsa, acting uncharacteristically timid, declined to leave the ship, but later destroyed her Jedi disguise, possibly showing a newfound respect for the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi Order]]. After departing the planet, Ghitsa produced a datacard she acquired from the ''Rook'', which contained information on [[Orko SkyMine Asteroid Processing Corporation|Orko SkyMine]], Durga's mysterious operation. Suspecting the importance, and credit value, of the datacard, Ghitsa decided to sell it to [[Talon Karrde]], to which she had earned the distrust of, and his information network. It would later lead to the discovery of the [[Darksaber (superweapon)|Darksaber]] project.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GamerCite|2|A Credit for Your Thoughts}}\n*''[[Hutt and Seek]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Simple Tricks]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ghitsa Dogder\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dogder, Ghitsa}}\n[[Category:Besadii servants]]\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
