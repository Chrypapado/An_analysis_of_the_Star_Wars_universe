He set up a small stall right outside Khoonda, the center of government on the planet. Akkere was found by [[Meetra Surik]] to be stealing parts from the [[Khoonda]] militia's [[Battle droid/Legends|defense droids]], as she found his spanner amongst the disabled droids within the Khoonda building.\n\nSurik forgave him after Akkere revealed that he had stolen the parts to help [[Akkere's brother|his brother]], whose wife was pregnant but couldn't afford a [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]]. Later, as atonement, Surik asked if he would join the militia for the [[Battle of Khoonda]]. He took part in defending Khoonda alongside Surik.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlternatively, Surik can try to turn him in because he broke the law, and will be forced to kill him. This action may or may not lead to a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] shift, depending on Surik's attitudes.\n\nSurik may not even ask Akkere about the matter, or even notice that he had been tampering with the droids. If Akkere is asked to join the militia, he will be seen inside the building after [[Azkul]] has fought his way through the outside defenses. He will also be equipped with no weapons at all, so will have only the ability to punch and kick when the \"battle\" starts.\n\nHe also possesses one of the only two [[Thorium charge]]s in the game and Surik can get it from his [[Death/Legends|dead]] body or buy them.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Akkere\n|es=Akkere\n|fr=Akkere\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Khoonda Militiamen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Sullustans]]"}}}]}}}}
