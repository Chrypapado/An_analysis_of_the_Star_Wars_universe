Her cover was that of a masseuse who was sent as a gift to her targets. Unlike some other masseuses in Tolea Biqua, her services were limited to the massage, but she was very skilled at it, and often left her client unconscious. She also offered needle-based therapy, and it was these needles which were her weapon of choice when her clients were actually her targets.<ref name=\"l\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nLalo had trained under one of [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] lieutenants.
