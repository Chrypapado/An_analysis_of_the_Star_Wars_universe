The commando team was lead by [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Judder Page/Legends|Judder Page]]. In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], Tors was part of the commando detachment sent to [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]] to deactivate the planetary shields to allow the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] to [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|liberate]] the planet.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Dialogue|Judder Page|Nice job, Tors.|Syla Tors|Thank you, Lieutenant.

Booby-trap is set.|attr=Judder Page, Syla Tors, and Keleman Ciro|src=The Saga Begins}}\nSyla Tors was a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who operated as a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]]. She later joined the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[New Republic Special Forces/Legends|Special Forces]] and was selected to join the elite [[Katarn Commandos]] under the command of [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Judder Page/Legends|Judder Page]]. Tors served as the team's [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and communications specialist.<ref name=\"HESB\" />\n\nDuring the New Republic's [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|mission to liberate]] the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]], elements of the Katarn Commandos were assigned to infiltrate the [[Imperial Government Complex]] and deactivate the [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shieldcovering]] the world's only continent. Tors piloted a [[Ghtroc Industries/Legends|Ghtroc]] [[Class 720 freighter]] carrying Lieutenant Page, [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Keleman Ciro]], [[Kaiya Adrimetrum]], [[Gottu]], and [[Vandro]]. Posing as a nondescript [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]], Tors intended to try and blend in with the civilian traffic fleeing the [[New Republic task force (Kal'Shebbol)|New Republic task force]] assault the planet. As the rest of the freighters were directed to designated landing fields, Tors piloted the vessel towards a pre-determined target to rendezvous with the team's [[Pathfinders|Pathfinder]], [[Lilla Dade]], who had been on the planet for three [[Standard day/Legends|days]].<ref name=\"TSB\">{{DarkStryder|The Saga Begins|The DarkStryder Campaign}}</ref>\n\nTors almost managed to get the freighter down when it was targeted by an [[Atgar SpaceDefense Corporation/Legends|Atgar]] [[1.4 FD P-Tower/Legends|1.4 FD P-Tower]] on the Imperial Government Complex. The [[Laser/Legends|laser]] blast destroyed the ship's starboard [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]], sending the freighter crashing to the ground. The ship skidded through grassland and decorative shrubberies before punching through the perimeter [[death fence]]. Despite crashing, Tors managed to put the vessel in between two hills that put it out of sight of any of the Complex's weapon emplacements. After setting an explosive booby-trap on the freighter, Tors joined the rest of the commando team in waiting for [[Pathfinders|Pathfinder]] [[Lilla Dade]] to make contact.<ref name=\"TSB\" />\n\nDade sent a local contact, the [[Defel/Legends|Defel]] [[Kl'aal]], to rendezvous with the command team and he lead them to the Pathfinder. Dade had found an access into the Complex, allowing the commandos to infiltrate Sarne's command center. Splitting his force, Page led Tors, Ciro, and Vandro to cut off the Moff's escape while Adrimetrum, Dade, Gottu, and Kl'aal headed to Sarne's detention level. Before reaching Sarne's escape vessel, a hidden [[Carrack-class light cruiser/Legends|''Carrack''-class light cruiser]], the four commandos were incapacitated by Sarne using a piece of [[Mindwarper module|exotic technology]]. The mind-numbing field laid the team low, allowing the Moff to reach his ship. Despite Ciro destroying the module, the [[Ambition|cruiser]] launched before the commandos could recover. Ciro managed to use a [[beamdrill]] to freeze the Complex's shields in the off position when the ship launched, completing the commando's primary mission. With the shields down, Page ordered Tors to contact the [[Unidentified New Republic admiral|admiral]] in command of the New Republic fleet and inform him of the situation.<ref name=\"TSB\" />\n\nTors flew an [[Assault shuttle/Legends|assault shuttle]] to extract [[Gottu]] and [[Idow]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Jendorn]]. The pair had infiltrated a [[Prison/Legends|prison]] compound in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Bruzion]] where they rescued six New Republic pilots from [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] captivity.<ref name=\"Gottu\">{{WEGCite|book=Dark Force Rising Sourcebook|story=Gottu and His Vibro-ax}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Okay Tors: whistle up the admiral and tell him the front door's open.''\"<br />\"''Yes, sir.

She was selected to join the Katarn Commandos because of her high level of morale, courage, skill and devotion to the New Republic's cause. Like all members of the team, Tors was a jack-of-all-trades with a variety of skills that allowed her to complete missions independently if needed. She also specialized in piloting [[Starship/Legends|starships]] when the Katarn Commandos were able to take their own transportation.
