As a biomorph, Anky had a natural talent for stealing, and made an ample career for himself as a professional thief.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]] he met the seventeen-year-old [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] known as [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]]. Anky taught Greedo the secret to living on the streets of Nar Shaddaa. He taught him how to steal, how to negotiate on the black market, and how to avoid the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] Port Control. Anky introduced Greedo to a ship merchant named [[Shug Ninx]] and his assistant [[Warb]]. Anky would occasionally throw some business Shug's way by stealing power couplings and therm pumps from other ships and selling them to him at a discount rate. Anky was present the day Greedo attempted to steal two [[Dekk-6 power coupling]]s from a [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]] known as the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. Unfortunately for Greedo, the ship's pilot and co-pilot, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] intercepted him. Shortly after this incident, Anky parted company with Greedo who preferred to live the life of a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] rather than that of a thief on the streets of Nar Shaddaa. Anky continued to ply his trade selling stolen ship parts to Shug Ninx.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nAnky Fremp resembled a typical Sionian Skup. He was a near-Human of short stature with \"small, closely spaced eyes, hair as brittle as glass and skin the color of [[Dianoga/Legends|Dianoga]] [[Cheese/Legends|cheese]]\".\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale]]''\n*[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)|''A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale'' webstrip]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|greedo|Greedo|id=eu|archivedate=20100414132600}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fremp, Anky}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Skups]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
