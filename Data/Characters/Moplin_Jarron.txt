He bought the place when [[Heff (Lepi)|Heff]] died. Since the shop was basically a junk store and the tourist trade during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Civil War]] was too low on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] to make a living from the shop, Jarron got his primary income from his ability to [[Forger (profession)/Legends|forge]] documents such as IDs and passports.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jarron, Moplin}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Sullustans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
