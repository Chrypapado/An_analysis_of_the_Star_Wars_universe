He was the aide-de-camp to Governor [[Bisad Koong|Koong]] of the [[Tawntoom]] province. Gaff was a [[Color/Legends|yellow]]-skinned [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] with three orange compound [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]&mdash;the third was located in the back of his head.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Kobok/Legends|Kobok]] from [[Roon/Legends|Roon]], Gaff left his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] to make a name for himself in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] criminal underworld. Like all members of his [[Species/Legends|species]], Gaff had stingers on his [[Limb/Legends|arms]] that secreted a potent [[Poison/Legends|poison]], able to knock humanoids unconscious, though Koboks were also susceptible to their own poison. Over [[Time/Legends|time]], he honed his skills as a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]], and [[Spy/Legends|spy]]. He often wore a [[Koboth Insurgent Mantle]], although it was not known if Gaff actually participated in the [[Mavvan Conflict]], a brief war involving his species and the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Gaff eventually returned to Roon, where he allied himself with [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Bisad Koong|Koong]]&mdash;a low point in his career, by his own estimation.\n\nKoong dragged Gaff into a number of schemes to curry favor with [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Terrinald Screed/Legends|Terrinald Screed]], though none went according to plan. Eventually, Koong tried to kill Screed for betraying him, and destroyed the Tawntoom Citadel, with Gaff inside. Luckily, the Kobok survived the blast.<ref name=\"GatORW\">''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DroidsCite|Tail of the Roon Comets}} {{1st}}\n*''[[Escape from the Monster Ship: A Droid Adventure]]''\n*{{DroidsCite|The Roon Games}}\n*{{DroidsCite|Across the Roon Sea}}\n*{{DroidsCite|The Frozen Citadel}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Droids (toy line)|''Star Wars: Droids'' toy line]] {{C|Cut}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Action Figure Archive]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|92|The Toys That Never Were}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|128|Proto Power!}}\n*{{DB|character|gaff|Gaff|archivedate=20100209222815}}\n*{{DB|character|governorkoong|Koong, Governor|archivedate=20100209194857}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-droids-re-animated-part-2|text=The Droids Re-Animated, Part 2|int=The Droids Re-Animated}}\n*{{SW|url=news/offscreen-but-not-forgotten-mini-rigs-body-rigs-and-other-kenner-vehicles|text=Offscreen, but Not Forgotten: Mini-Rigs, Body-Rigs, and Other Kenner Vehicles}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Gaff\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Koboks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Roon residents]]"}}}]}}}}
