See the whole galaxy and remain objective about it?|Mina Bonteri|Queen's Shadow}}\n'''Mina Bonteri''' was a [[Gender|female]] [[human]] native to the [[planet]] [[Onderon]]. Prior to the [[Clone Wars]], Bonteri served as a mentor to [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] on [[Naboo]], and the two became close friends. During the war, Bonteri was the [[senator]] of the [[Japrael sector]] in the [[Separatist Senate]]. Following Bonteri's [[death]], her son, [[Lux Bonteri]], filled her position. However, he left the Confederacy when he learned [[Count]] [[Dooku]], the Confederate [[Head of State]], had been the one who arranged her death.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Separatist Crisis===\nPrior to the [[First Battle of Geonosis|outbreak]] of the [[Clone Wars]], by at least [[28 BBY]],{{Fact}} Mina Bonteri held the position of [[senator]] for the [[planet]] [[Onderon]], [[Gender|her]] [[homeworld]].<ref name=\"War on Two Fronts\">{{TCW|A War on Two Fronts}}</ref> Sometime before her appointment to senator, Bonteri and her [[Mina Bonteri's husband|husband]] had a son, [[Lux Bonteri]],<ref name=\"Heroes\" /> and by 28 BBY, had also secretly began to follow the orders of the [[Count of Serenno]], [[Dooku]], who had been making preparations for an approaching [[Separatist Crisis|secessionist movement]] by recruitings worlds whose inhabitants preferred a populist government. As a result, Bonteri would often receive and answer calls from the [[Count]] within her office, which had later come to the attention of [[Galactic Republic]] Senators [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]], [[Mon Mothma]], and [[Onaconda Farr]].<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\nShe met [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] at a party being hosted by [[Supreme Chancellor|Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], being introduced to her by Senator [[Rush Clovis]] of [[Scipio]]. The two of them instantly hit it off as friends, and since she was the first politican to be nice to Padm\u00e9 since Padm\u00e9 joined the Senate six weeks earlier, Mina became something of a mentor to the younger senator. Their relationship soon began conflicting with Mina's loyalty to Dooku once Padm\u00e9 began introducing legislation and motions counter to Dooku's goals, and after the [[Bromlarch]] crisis, when Mina failed to help the [[Trade Federation]] [[Invasion of Naboo|take over]] the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] planet, she was forced to cut off her mentorship with Padm\u00e9,<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" /> though they remained friends up until the true beginning of the Separatist Crisis in [[24 BBY]], this being the last time Padm\u00e9 would see Lux until the midpoint of the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"Heroes\" />\n\n=== Clone Wars===\n{{Quote|Surely there's room in the galaxy for Confederate and Republic planets to coexist.

She and her son relocated to the Confederacy's [[capital]] [[planet]], [[Raxus Secundus]] where they had a [[Mina Bonteri's house|home]] in [[Raxulon]].

Amidala and her friend, the [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], secretly visited her on Raxus to discuss the proposed initiative. Bonteri was initially skeptical that the plan would work, but decided to do her best to convince the Separatist Senate to act on it. During a session of the Confederate Senate, Bonteri called for a vote to open the peace talks with Republic.
