I'm Mayor Guh'rantt. Do you know the history of Mos Eisley? It's a beautiful city, full of life and character and one of the best cantinas in the known galaxy.|Mikdanyell Guh'rantt|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Mikdanyell Guh'rantt''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] who served as [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the early [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Mayor Guh'rantt was deeply connected to the criminal underground of the [[City/Legends|city]] but was eventually exposed by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Navy]] [[Chief/Legends|Chief]] [[Moradmin Bast/Legends|Moradmin Bast]]. Despite this, Guh'rantt continued to serve as mayor following Chief Bast's [[Death/Legends|death]] during the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. It was during this [[Time/Legends|time]] that Mayor Guh'rantt actually struggled to improve Mos Eisley's reputation as a hive of scum and villainy by improving the city's [[Mos Eisley Police Authority|police force]] and combating criminal elements with limited resources. During his time in office, Mayor Guh'rantt worked with and gave a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] a Key to the City for uncovering [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] diabolical plot to provoke [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] attacks on Mos Eisley. In addition to protecting his city from other hostile entities, Guh'rantt was also interested in the planet's [[Historian/Legends|history]], although he was mistaken about several historical events.\n\n==Biography==\n===Mayoral Dealings===\n{{Quote|Remember me in the next election!|Mayor Mikdanyell Guh'rantt, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nMikdanyell Guh'rantt was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] politician who prided himself on knowing the [[Historian/Legends|history]] of events on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], a [[Desert/Legends|desert]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] located in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. He became [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] of the large Tatooinian [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] [[City/Legends|city]] known as [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] sometime prior to the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. As mayor, he worked at the city's commerce [[Mos Eisley Guild Hall|guild hall]], a building which was used for the daily operations of Mos Eisley's local government. Mos Eisley had a reputation for being a cesspool of criminal activity, and Guh'rantt was not immune from it.<ref name= \"SWG:MMG\" /> Mayor Guh'rantt became deeply connected to the city's criminal underground, and was eventually uncovered by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Chief/Legends|Chief]] [[Moradmin Bast/Legends|Moradmin Bast]].<ref name=\"TCSWE:Guh'Rantt\">{{CSWECite|I|374|Guh'Rantt, Mikdanyell}}</ref> However, the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officer]] was soon [[Death/Legends|killed]] during the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] when [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Rebel pilot/Legends|pilots]] destroyed the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] he was occupying.<ref name=\"TCSWE:Bast\">{{CSWECite|I|63|Bast, Chief Moradmin}}</ref> Despite being revealed as a crook, Guh'rantt continued to serve as mayor of the city after the Battle of Yavin.<ref name=\"TCSWE:Guh'Rantt\" /> Around that time, the man by the name [[Crix Yarrow]] served as the aide to the mayor.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=class|Entertainer|The Entertainer's Life|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nAn affable figure, Guh'rantt was always eager to promote his city and show off his supposed knowledge of Tatooine's history to inquiring [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]]. He believed Mos Eisley to be a city full of life and character, and resented its perception as a \"wretched hive of scum and villainy.\" He believed that while the streets of Mos Eisley could be considered scary, they were no more dangerous than those of any other city in the galaxy. Although he was knowledgeable, Guh'rantt was mistaken about certain historic events on Tatooine. He was skeptical of the rumors purporting that a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Knight]] [[Cho sun/Legends|sliced]] the [[Limb/Legends|arm]] off an [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] patron in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. Guh'rantt believed that the Jedi Knights had not been around since the days of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]], and that it would not make sense for one to be on Tatooine, much less a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in Mos Eisley. However, the rumors were indeed true, for the legendary [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] known as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] had in fact attacked the Aqualish criminal known as [[Ponda Baba/Legends|Ponda Baba]]. Guh'rantt also confused the [[Dim-U|Dim-U monks]] with the [[B'omarr Order/Legends|B'omarr Monks]] by saying that it was the Dim-U who would remove their [[Brain/Legends|brains]] for enlightenment, and place them in [[BT-16 perimeter droid]]s. He also erroneously claimed that the Dim-U once used [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] as a monastery, when in fact the B'omarr did. However, he did correctly point out to inquiring spacers that the Dim-U worshiped [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]], a type of beast which thrived on the planet.<ref name= \"SWG:MMG\" />\n\n===Key to the City===\nIn addition to sharing his pride and knowledge of Mos Eisley to visitors, Mayor Guh'rantt spent time helping spacers find work that best suited their skill set. One such spacer was directed to Guh'rantt by a Human woman named [[Trehla Keelo]], a citizen of Mos Eisley who would often guide visitors through the streets of the city.<ref name=\"SWG:TtMG\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=general|Talk to Mayor Guh'rantt|Tatooine}}</ref> When the spacer spoke with Guh'rantt in the commerce guild hall, the mayor asked the individual to meet with several people throughout Mos Eisley to get a better idea of what type of profession to pursue. These people included the \n[[entertainer]] [[Anetia Kah'ryn]],<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> the [[Artisan/Legends|artisan]] [[Alduq Besene]],<ref name=\"SWG:AAT\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=class|Artisan|An Artist's Tools|Tatooine}}</ref> the [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] [[Purvis Arrison]]<ref name=\"SWG:MT\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=class|Marksman|Marksman Tasks|Tatooine}}</ref> and the [[Scout/Legends|scout]] [[Entha Kandela]].<ref name=\"SWG:ST\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=class|Scout|Scout Tasks|Tatooine}}</ref> Another one was a [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] named [[Peawp R'dawc]], who was the owner of a [[R'dawc Bodyguard Agency|bodyguard agency]]. R'dawc, trained in the art of [[Unarmed combat|hand-to-hand combat]], wanted to see if a job as a brawler would be best suited for the spacer. To that end, the spacer worked a series of bodyguard jobs for R'dawc, including protecting a local businessman, a [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] named [[Otwi Opawl]].<ref name=\"SWG:RBA\">{{SWGcite|exp=TTE|type=class|Brawler|R'dawc Bodyguard Agency|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\n===Debt to Jabba===\n{{Quote|Yes. My...debt. My next payment, a speeder deed, was stolen from me. I can't divert...er...raise the money with all the problems in the city. If you do some things for me, it might...free up some funds I need.|Mikdanyell Guh'rantt|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nGuh'rantt eventually found himself in the unfortunate position of being indebted to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], the ruthless [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] who headed a large [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|criminal empire]] from Tatooine. Guh'rantt was planning on putting down a [[Landspeeder/Legends|speeder]] deed as his next payment, but it was stolen from him.<ref name=\"SWG:IiH\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|If It Helps|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the mayor was in luck. The [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Majordomo/Legends|majordomo]] known as [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna]] was eying a spacer as a potential servant for Jabba's criminal empire. Bib Fortuna told this spacer to help the mayor find a way to repay Jabba. The spacer ultimately agreed, and headed to the Mos Eisley's commerce guild hall to meet with the mayor. Guh'rantt explained the circumstances surrounding his debt and the unfortunate speeder deed theft to the spacer. He also insinuated that he could not embezzle public [[Currency/Legends|funds]] to pay off his debt, due to the fact that the city was already experiencing many problems. However, Mayor Guh'rantt believed that if the spacer would help carry out a few public services, it would free up enough funds to repay Jabba. With that said, the spacer agreed to help the mayor, not so much out of altruism, but rather out of a desire to curry favor with Bib Fortuna and Jabba.<ref name=\"SWG:IiH\" />\n\nSome of the tasks the spacer needed to carry out involved animal control, eliminating hoodlums, and controlling the ever-pervasive threat of [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] attacks. The spacer worked with several key city officials to solve these problems, including the Twi'lek animal control [[Officer/Legends|officer]] Entha Kandela, [[Human/Legends|Human]] veteran [[Sniper/Legends|marksman]] Purvis Arrison, and Peawp R'dawc. Most of these officials were cynical about the mayor's reluctance to increase their funding, but they were nonetheless willing to accept the spacer's services.<ref name=\"SWG:IiH\" />\n\nWorking with Entha Kandela, the spacer ran a census on the vermin infestation which was posing a threat to the public health. It turned out the the situation was indeed hazardous. [[Womp rat/Legends|Womp rats]] were spreading [[grunge fever]], [[kreetle]]s were weakening the soil around Mos Eisley, [[Rill (species)|tempest rills]] were chewing insulation and power cables, and [[rockmite]]s were laying eggs all around town. However, the spacer succeeded in helping Kandela, both by killing many of these creatures and by extracting samples for medical and pest control purposes.<ref name=\"SWG:ACO\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Animal Control Officer|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\nWorking with Peawp R'dawc, the spacer successfully oversaw the elimination of desert [[Swooper/Legends|swoopers]], moisture thieves, [[Smuggler/Legends|gunrunners]], and even a hoard of error-prone [[B1-Series battle droid]]s which crashed outside of town in a [[Class-6 escape pod]]. But perhaps the most important mission for R'dawc was the elimination of a dangerous [[Nikto/Legends|Nikto]] criminal named [[Vaigon Shinn]], who operated out of a [[Vaigon Shinn's Hideout|bunker]] not far outside the city limits. Despite the dangers, the spacer successfully launched an attack on the bunker, killing the guards and their leader Vaigon Shinn, who operated as the [[Shinn muggers|gang's]] [[Chief/Legends|chief]] mugger. R'dawc was pleased, but lamented the fact that the mayor lacked the budget to hire the spacer full time.<ref name=\"SWG:HHE\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Hoodlums, Hoodlums Everywhere|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the veteran marksman Purvis Arrison remained convinced that Mos Eisley was in a state of war against the indigenous Sand People, known as Tusken Raiders. While this was an exaggeration, Tuskens were indeed amassing in a small village just outside of Mos Eisley, colloquially referred to as [[Junktown]]. Arrison first tasked the spacer with performing reconnaissance of the village, and then later ordered the spacer to do battle with them. The spacer succeeded in killing in at least fifteen Tuskens, thinning their ranks enough to keep Mos Eisley safe for the time being.<ref name=\"SWG:TRiME\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Tusken Raiders in Mos Eisley|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] entertainer Anetia Kah'ryn discovered that Jabba was responsible of the Tusken Raider attacks on Mos Eisley.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Mayor Guh'rantt was interested, though not necessarily surprised, to learn that Jabba was in fact provoking Tusken attacks to advance his agenda.<ref name=\"SWG:TRiME\" /> However, it was of little concern at the time, for thanks to the spacer, Guh'rantt now had the finances necessary to make the next debt payment to the Hutt crime lord.<ref name=\"SWG:IiH\" /> The mayor was also pleased to learn that by eliminating many criminal entities around the city, he was getting fewer complaints from the townsfolk.<ref name=\"SWG:HHE\" /> He also hoped that helping Entha Kendala with her animal control problems would keep her off his back for the time being.<ref name=\"SWG:ACO\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n===Keeping the Peace===\n{{Quote|Let me guess.
