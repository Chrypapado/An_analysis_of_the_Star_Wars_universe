Strangely, Praven chose to spare Hare'en and the Jawas, who soon barricaded themselves within the facility as the Sand People invaded. Luckily, they were rescued by the [[Hero of Tython]].\n\nDespite their relief, Hare'en detected that the Shock Drum had been activated and the vibrations prevented them from determining its exact location. However, Brrik ingeniously suggested they calibrate the sensors for ultrasonic vibrations. While the Hero performed this task and confronted Praven, Brrik and his family recklessly chased their droids to the Shock Drum's location in the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]]; however, the cave housing the superweapon was inhabited by [[Sand demon]]s. Thankfully, the Hero once again came to their rescue, killed the Sand Demons and deactivated the Shock Drum, preventing the destruction of Tatooine and Kiwiiks.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Jawas]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
