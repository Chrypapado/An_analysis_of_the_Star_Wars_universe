Like many before him, he did not return.|Freyyr, to Revan, regarding Guun Han Saresh|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Guun Han Saresh''' was a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] best known for his exploits during the [[Great Hunt (Jedi)|Great Hunt]] of [[3993 BBY]]. A native of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], Saresh was born into a rich and powerful [[Saresh family|family]] with a history of [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]]. At some point, Saresh was taken in by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], completing his [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]] and earning the title of Knight. In the aftermath of the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], Saresh joined a hunting party of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knights, including [[Human/Legends|Humans]] [[Duron Qel-Droma]] and [[Shaela Nuur]], who distinguished themselves during the Great Hunt&mdash;a collective Jedi effort to eliminate [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]-created beasts across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].\n\nIn 3993 BBY, one [[Standard week/Legends|week]] after the official end of the Hunt, Saresh, Qel-Droma and Nuur were sent to [[Korriban]] on a secret [[Cleansing of Korriban|mission]] to eliminate the vicious and highly dangerous [[Terentatek/Legends|terentatek]] from the Sith [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. However, Saresh's disapproval of Qel-Droma's and Nuur's budding romance fractured the group, leading to the Twi'lek abandoning them on Korriban and setting off instead for [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], to hunt a terentatek that he had heard existed in the world's dark [[Shadowlands/Legends|Shadowlands]]. The beast did exist, and Saresh set a trap for it&mdash;when Saresh attempted to attack the terentatek, however, his [[Force-imbued blade]] broke on its thick hide. Without any defense, Saresh was swiftly devoured by the terentatek.\n\n==Biography==\n===Not-so-humble beginnings===\n{{Quote|After all, Duron, Shaela and Guun Han are our greatest hunters&hellip;|[[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Aleco Stusea]]|Shadows and Light}}\n[[File:Saresh.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Guun Han Saresh battles a terentatek on Tatooine.]]\nA [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Guun Han Saresh was born into a rich and powerful [[Saresh family|family]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. His family, known for its cruelty and arrogance along with its wealth and [[Politics/Legends|political]] sway, had [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] in its [[Blood/Legends|bloodline]], and many of their number had become [[Jedi/Legends|members]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. At some point Saresh, the heir to the family fortune, too was discovered to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], and was taken in for [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]]. To commemorate Saresh's acceptance by the Order, his [[Guun Han Saresh's father|father]] commissioned the creation of a powerful headband known as the [[Circlet of Saresh]]. In order to prevent the gift from leading Saresh down a path of arrogance, Saresh's father made certain that the Circlet could only be worn by someone committed to the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]].<ref name=\"kotor\" /> Eventually, Saresh [[Jedi Trials/Legends|achieved]] the status of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], serving as a Knight in the immediate aftermath of the [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]-spanning [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].<ref name=\"shadows\" /> Ending in [[3996 BBY]], the war pitted the Jedi Order and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] against the [[Sith Empire (Great Sith War)|Sith Empire]] headed by former Jedi [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] and [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]]. Although the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] were defeated, many [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]-created monstrosities were still present on planets across the galaxy, posing a threat to the Jedi and the general populace. In response, the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] organized the [[Great Hunt (Jedi)|Great Hunt]], a collaborative effort by the Order as a whole to systematically wipe those creatures out.<ref name=\"nec\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\nOver the next few [[Standard year/Legends|years]], Saresh would distinguish himself in the Great Hunt.<ref name=\"shadows\" /> Although creatures such as [[Sith wyrm]]s and [[silan]] were targeted by the Hunt,<ref name=\"kotorcg\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> Saresh's greatest nemesis proved to be the [[Terentatek/Legends|terentatek]].<ref name=\"shadows\" /> [[Sith alchemy/Legends|Alchemically]] created by Exar Kun, the terentatek was about half the size of a [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] beast and fed off Force-sensitive blood. During the Great Hunt, Saresh joined a group of Jedi including [[Duron Qel-Droma]]&mdash;cousin of the infamous Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma&mdash;[[Shaela Nuur]] and [[Cale Berkona]], who together traveled to worlds such as [[Tython/Legends|Tython]], [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] and [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] in search of terentateks. The team was extremely successful, and Saresh and the others gained reputations as the very best hunters in the Jedi Order. In [[3993 BBY]], Saresh traveled with his compatriots to the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] world of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. After taking down several terentateks, Saresh and the group tracked the last such beast on Tatooine to a remote cave. Although the terentatek [[Death/Legends|killed]] [[Unidentified Jedi (Great Hunt)|one of their number]], Qel-Droma was able to [[Mind trick/Legends|confuse]] the beast with a mental [[Force power/Legends|Force power]], and Saresh and the others moved in for the kill. After slaying the terentatek, the group burned the corpses of their prey and left the scene, Saresh supporting an injured Berkona as they returned to their [[Starship/Legends|starship]].<ref name=\"shadows\" />\n\n===Final mission===\n{{Quote|I wish I could have saved them. I truly do. But I must not let the past ''haunt'' me. There can be no ''regret''. If my mind is not clear on this hunt&hellip; then I will surely suffer the same fate.|Guun Han Saresh, before his battle on Kashyyyk|Shadows and Light}}\n[[File:CleansingofKashyyyk-ShadowsandLight.jpg|thumb|right|Guun Han Saresh leaps into action on Kashyyyk.]]\nFive [[Standard day/Legends|days]] after the [[Cleansing of Tatooine|ordeal]] on Tatooine, the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] called an official end to the Great Hunt. However, two days later, Saresh, Qel-Droma and Nuur were called in front of the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|lesser Council]] that governed the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. There, the three were informed that they had been specifically chosen by the High Council to undertake a secret mission&mdash;to travel to the Sith [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Korriban]] and [[Cleansing of Korriban|rid]] the planet of terentateks. Needing the operation to be conducted quickly and discreetly, the High Council chose Saresh, Qel-Droma and Nuur, who were believed to be the greatest hunters the Order had to offer. Afterward, Saresh had a discussion about the mission with Berkona, who had been left off the Korriban team. Saresh assured his friend that he was not concerned with the risk of the mission, although he was unsure that their assignment could be successful unless Qel-Droma and Nuur were able to control their feelings for one another. The next day, Saresh's group shipped out to Korriban, making their way to the relatively well-populated [[Dreshdae]] settlement. Saresh, Qel-Droma and Nuur acquired a safehouse in Dreshdae, using it as a base as they centered their investigation into the whereabouts of terentateks in the town.<ref name=\"shadows\" />\n\nDuring his [[Time/Legends|time]] on Korriban, Saresh heard many rumors about terentateks, including tales of a \"great beast\" that lived in the dark [[Shadowlands/Legends|Shadowlands]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. Saresh chose not to act on the information at that time, instead focusing on Korriban with Qel-Droma and Nuur. Their efforts led them to a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in the heart of Dreshdae, where Saresh set his sights on a young female [[Unidentified Twi'lek Sith (Korriban)|Twi'lek]] [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] whom he spied at the bar. Saresh bought the Sith a number of [[Tarisian ale]]s, and ended up seducing the Twi'lek. After spending the night with her, Saresh woke up early the next morning and stole a [[Datacard/Legends|datacard]] that would grant the Jedi hunters access to the [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|Valley of the Dark Lords]], where it was suspected that the terentateks lived. When he returned to the safehouse, however, he found Qel-Droma and Nuur locked in a romantic embrace. Furious that they would break the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code's]] rules against attachment and passion, Saresh expressed his deep disappointment in his teammates. Telling them that they were walking the path of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], Saresh found himself engaged in a heated argument with Nuur, which was quickly broken up by Qel-Droma. Highly concerned, Saresh asked Qel-Droma whether he and Nuur would be able to control their passion, in order to assure success of the mission&mdash;Qel-Droma responded by telling Saresh that they would not renounce their love. Disappointed in his friend, Saresh gave them the key to the Valley of the Dark Lords, and left them behind.<ref name=\"shadows\" />\n\nSaresh left Korriban for good, traveling instead to Kashyyyk to look into the \"great beast\" he had heard of. Believing it to be a terentatek, Saresh asked many of the local [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] about the tales&mdash;the natives told him that the beast had slain many Jedi over the years. One of the Wookiees Saresh encountered was [[Freyyr]], [[Chief/Legends|Chieftain]] of the village of [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]], who remembered him [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] later as a proud and boastful young man. Three days after abandoning the mission to Korriban, Saresh descended into the Shadowlands, intending to hunt a different terentatek. Using a [[Bow/Legends|compound bow]], Saresh killed a [[Mykal/Legends|mykal]] and strung the corpse up as bait. Afterward, Saresh took out his [[Force-imbued blade]] and took up position on some high rocks, waiting for the \"great beast\" to arrive. Surely enough, the beast, indeed a terentatek, came forth to feast upon the mykal. When the terentatek was in striking range, Saresh jumped from his perch, stabbing the creature with his blade. However, when he withdrew the sword, he found to his horror that the terentatek's tough hide had broken the blade at its hilt. Defenseless, Saresh could do nothing as the terentatek set upon him and devoured him, swallowing the Circlet of Saresh along with the Twi'lek. Saresh's death was [[Force sense/Legends|felt]], [[Light-year/Legends|light-years]] away, by Nuur and Qel-Droma as they ventured into the Valley of the Dark Lords. Saresh's former compatriots met the same fate, both being killed by terentateks in the dark underbelly of Korriban.<ref name=\"shadows\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|The Council felt it was too dangerous to send anyone else in search of their remains, so their exact fate is not known. But let their deaths serve as a warning to you, Padawan. The terentatek are an abomination, they are ruthless engines of death and destruction.

However, their stories were not forgotten.<ref name=\"kotor\" /> In [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"nec\" /> a Jedi Knight named [[Deesra Luur Jada]] told the story of the Jedi hunters to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]]&ndash;turned&ndash;Jedi [[Padawan/Legends|trainee]] who would go on to play a huge role in the ongoing [[Jedi Civil War]]. While on Kashyyyk searching for an ancient [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Star Map]] not long after, Revan came across Freyyr, now [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] to the Shadowlands, who told the Jedi of his encounter with Saresh years earlier. Soon afterward, Revan slew the terentatek that had killed Saresh decades earlier, finding the Circlet of Saresh and the dead Twi'lek's [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] in the process.<ref name=\"kotor\" /> In addition, the Circlet may have been discovered by the Jedi Knight [[Meetra Surik]] during her adventures across the galaxy during the [[Dark Wars]] years later.<ref name=\"kotor2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref> One of Saresh's descendants, [[Leontyne Saresh]],<ref name=\"Reconstruction Efforts\">{{TORcite|type=faction|Republic|Reconstruction Efforts|Taris}}</ref> served as [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] of the Republic during the time of the [[Galactic War]] with a [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]], taking the seat<ref name=\"Chaos and Harmony\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Consular|Chaos and Harmony|Corellia}}</ref> in [[3640 BBY]].<ref name=\"Date\">Act III of ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' takes place in [[3640 BBY]] per the reasoning [[Template:TOR dates|here]].</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You self-righteous, arrogant&hellip;|Shaela Nuur, to Guun Han Saresh|Shadows and Light}}\n[[File:Saresh_bow.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Guun Han Saresh on the hunt]]\nAlthough Guun Han Saresh saw himself as a faithful servant of the light, others, such as Duron Qel-Droma, Shaela Nuur, and Freyyr, remembered him as prideful, arrogant and boastful.<ref name=\"kotor\" /> Indeed, Saresh was extremely confident in his skills, believing, erroneously, that he could take down a terentatek single-handedly. He was a committed hunter, and valued the success of his mission above all else&mdash;and if he felt that he could not be successful in a task, or if too much of a risk was posed to him, he had no qualms with abandoning it.<ref name=\"shadows\" />\n\nSaresh also placed great emphasis on carrying out the wishes of the Jedi Council, a rationale that he used to justify many of his actions. He believed and trusted in the wisdom of the Council, but did not see its members as omniscient or perfect in their knowledge. Although close friends with Qel-Droma and Nuur, Saresh was adamantly opposed to the romantic nature of their relationship, believing it to be the path of the dark side, and was apt to quote the Jedi Code when rebuking them for their attachment. Yet he had no problems with seducing a Sith apprentice while on Korriban, although he expressed that he did not enjoy it, only doing so in order to further their investigation. Still, Saresh truly cared for Qel-Droma and Nuur's well-being, and hoped that he could save them from themselves. In the end, however, he was solely focused on the hunt, and eliminating terentateks wherever they tread, by any means necessary. Saresh had [[Color/Legends|green]] skin and red [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"shadows\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|I am a hunter, Cale.

Unlike the other members of his hunting group, he eschewed the use of a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|combat]], instead preferring to use a Force-imbued sword. He used a very aggressive style in melee fighting, putting his opponent on the defensive with powerful strikes from his blade.
