Furthermore, the short story ''[[Lando Calrissian: Idiot's Array]]'', which describes Raynor's last assassination attempt against Calrissian happening around six weeks after the sabacc match, reveals that the ambush happens within these six weeks.</ref> former [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Administrator/Legends|Administrator]] [[Dominic Raynor]], who had [[Gambling/Legends|gambled]] away the [[City/Legends|city]] in a game of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] against Calrissian, hired the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]] to hunt down the new Administrator because he believed that Calrissian had cheated in order to win their game.<ref name=\"SLR\" />\n\nBossk brought a band of [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] and [[Assassin/Legends|cutthroats]]&mdash;a [[Unidentified Twi'lek 1 (Ambush in Cloud City)|Twi'lek scoundrel]], [[Unidentified Twi'lek 2 (Ambush in Cloud City)|another scoundrel]] of the same [[Species/Legends|species]], a [[Unidentified Duros (Ambush in Cloud City)|Duro mercenary]], and a [[Unidentified Quarren (Ambush in Cloud City)|Quarren assassin]]&mdash;to the city and set a trap for Calrissian.

In response, Calrissian went to the city's lower levels to check the pod, taking his Twi'lek bodyguard and four [[Bespin Wing Guard/Legends|Bespin guards]] along as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"SLR\" />\n\nAfter Calrissian's group entered the maintenance level, a [[Blast door/Legends|blast door]] suddenly shut behind them, and the Twi'lek and her companions came under [[Blaster/Legends|fire]] from Bossk's ad hoc bounty hunter group. Calrissian's escorts decided to hold them off while the Baron Administrator escaped through a nearby [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]], and the Twi'lek engaged her opponents with a [[Quarterstaff/Legends|quarterstaff]] in the combat that erupted. Thanks to the distress call sent by a member of Calrissian's party, a quartet of Wing Guards, concerned by the sound of the [[Lightfight|firefight]], arrived to assist the Baron Administrator, who fled the [[Ambush in Cloud City|ambush]] through a nearby [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]].<ref name=\"SLR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:TwilekBodyguard.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Twi'lek bodyguard's figurine]]\nThe Twi'lek appeared in ''[[Sore Loser's Revenge]]'', a [[Wizards.com]] online scenario written by [[Eric Cagle]] for the ''[[Star Wars Miniatures]]'' collectible tabletop strategy game in [[2004]].
