Unfortunately, Bastra was captured by Loor and interrogated. After one interrogation session, Bastra was immersed in [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]]. This killed Bastra due to an [[allergy]] he had previously developed from a contaminated batch of bacta from [[Lot ZX1449F]]. This contamination had also caused Bastra to contract [[blastonecrosis]], a fact which Loor had used in an unsuccessful attempt to break Bastra. The signs of the disease had been hidden because Bastra regularly took doses of [[lotiramine]], a chemical which interacted lethally with the truth serum [[Skirtopanol/Legends|skirtopanol]], to prevent Imperial agents from gaining information from him. Bastra's death was documented in [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] transmission [[A34020121]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn one scene, he is called \"Gus Bastra.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|7|Missed Chance}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Hideouts & Strongholds]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{FFCite|14|ROG3, ''X-wing Rogue Squadron''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gil Bastra\n|hu=Gil Bastra\n|pl=Gil Bastra\n|fi=Gil Bastra\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bastra, Gil}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
