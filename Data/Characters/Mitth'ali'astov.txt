She was born on [[Colonial Station Camco]] to a poor and unrenowned [[Mitth&#39;ali&#39;astov's original family|family]], and was brought to The [[Expansionary Fleet complex]] on [[Naporar]] for sky-walker training when she was young. She started navigating when she was seven. At one point, she served as a [[navigator]] aboard the ''[[Tomra]],'' where she met [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]]. Her [[Precognition|Third Sight]] only lasted until she was thirteen, a year earlier than a typical sky-walker. She was adopted by the [[Chiss Ascendancy]]'s [[Mitth family]] as a [[merit adoptive]]. She then became sky-walker [[Che'ri]]'s Caregiver, assigned to take care of, teach, supervise, and parent the young navigator. She later became a [[Trial-born]] after completing the Trials, with Mitth family [[Patriarch]] [[Mitth'oor'akiord]] personally welcoming her as a Trial-born of the Mitth.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nThalias accompanied Thrawn on many missions, pretending to be a [[Chiss family hostage|family hostage]], multiple times. She found it hard to leave Che'ri behind, as she remembered how hard it was without a caretaker while she was a sky-walker.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nWhen the ''[[Springhawk]]'' came upon the [[refugee]]s led by [[the Magys]] on [[Rapacc]], the Magys insisted on speaking only with Caregiver Thalias, as Thalias had once touched \"[[The Force|The Beyond]].\" The Magys, a Force-sensitive of [[The Magys species|an unnamed species]], sought suicide of the remaining 200 members of her species so they could \"join the Beyond\" and heal their [[Sunrise|homeworld]], which had been devastated by a [[Sunrise civil war|civil war]]. Thalias sought to prevent the mass suicide of what may be the last survivors of an otherwise extinct [[species]], and sought to provide hope of rebuilding to the Magys. She convinced Thrawn to bring the ''Springhawk'', with Magys and an escort aboard, to the Magys' homeworld, where they were [[First skirmish over Sunrise|attacked]] by forces affiliated with the [[Grysk Hegemony]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''</ref>\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nAli'astov lost her [[Precognition|Third Sight]] at age 13, one year prior to the typical age at which sky-walkers lost that ability.
