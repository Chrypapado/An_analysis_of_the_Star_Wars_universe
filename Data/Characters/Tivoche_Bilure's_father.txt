His family lived in poverty and never had enough [[credit]]s to buy sufficient [[Foodstuff|food]]. At some point, Bilure's [[Parent|father]] took ill with [[Shipbreaker's Cough]]. The fear of working his entire life in poverty and seeing no future for himself other than growing old and developing the same disease as his father eventually drove Bilure to leave [[Corellia]] behind.<ref name=\"Tales from Vandor\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bilure, Tivoche}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified fathers]]"}}}]}}}}
