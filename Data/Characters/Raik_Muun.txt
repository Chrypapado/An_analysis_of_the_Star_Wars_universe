Muun joined the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and studied at the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy|Jedi school]] that was located on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]] in the [[Cularin system]]. She attempted to pursue a romantic relationship with fellow student [[Nek Lawsirk]], but he rejected her and she was dismissed from the Academy by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kirlocca]]. Muun left the [[Star system/Legends|system]] and fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. She returned a few years later, determined to destroy the reputation of the Almas [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and ultimately drive them out of the Cularin system. She based herself on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Tilnes]] and, after learning of the existence of a dangerous creature known as the [[t'salak]], Munn traveled to the planet [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]], where she planned to find the creature and use it in her plot against the Jedi.\n\nMuun discovered the [[Cloud Mountain cavern|cavern]] where the creature was hidden but was unsuccessful in freeing it. Afterward, she began to pursue a different method for freeing the t'salak by capturing Nek Lawsirk and then disguising herself as him, allowing her to obtain the creature from [[Morad'Ka]], the [[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]] of the [[Tarasin]] tribe [[Jaraana irstat]]. She forced some captured [[Scientist/Legends|scientists]] to make the creature reproduce but was driven from Tilnes by a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] who had been hired by the Jedi to find Lawsirk. Muun then orchestrated a plan to unleash the t'salak during a peace conference that was being held by the Jedi and the [[Sentient Beings Opposing Violence]] aboard the [[Luxury liner/Legends|liner]] ''[[Luxury]]'', using the creatures to enrage the attending Jedi and so discredit the Jedi Order. However, the agents who had driven her from Tilnes confronted her and thwarted her plans, forcing her to flee the [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. Following the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Muun traveled to the planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and became the apprentice of [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]] [[Valin Draco]], a Dark Jedi who served the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] as a [[Jedi hunter/Legends|Jedi hunter]]. She accompanied him on a mission to investigate the ruins of the Almas Academy but was defeated when they were [[Mission to Almas|attacked]] by a group of [[Alderaanian Resistance]] agents.\n\n==Biography==\n===Dismissal from the Almas Academy===\n[[File:Kirlocca.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Kirlocca, the Jedi Master who dismissed Raik Muun from the Almas Academy]]\n{{Quote|I was forced to dismiss her from the Academy, and I would not be surprised to find she holds a grudge.|Jedi Master Kirlocca, on Raik Muun|Force Contention}}\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human half-breed]], Raik Muun was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. She joined the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and enrolled in the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy|Jedi learning center]] located on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Almas]], in the [[Cularin system]]. However, she did not adapt well to the rigors of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] life and attempted to pursue a romantic relationship with one of her fellow students, the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] [[Nek Lawsirk]], despite such relationships being forbidden among the Jedi. Lawsirk rejected her advances, which greatly upset her. [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kirlocca]], the Academy's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] instructor, learned of what Muun had done and believed that it showed she was unsuitable to become a Jedi, so he expelled her from the Academy. She blamed Lawsirk and Kirlocca for her dismissal and left the [[Star system/Legends|system]] to plot revenge against the Almas Jedi.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" />\n\n===Searching for the t'salak===\n{{Quote|My dreams tell me that something has disturbed the prison.|Mother Morad'Ka, on Raik Muun's attempt to release the t'salak|Force Concession}}\nMuun's hatred for the Jedi turned her to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and she became a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]. A few years later, during the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], she returned to the Cularin system, intent on gaining revenge against the Jedi. She set up a temporary base in an abandoned chemical factory on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Tilnes]] and obtained some [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] to serve her.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" /> After researching the myths of the [[Tarasin]], a [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] [[Species/Legends|species]] that was native to the planet [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]], Muun learned of the existence of a dangerous creature known as the [[t'salak]].<ref name=\"Force Convention\" /> The t'salak was a seemingly indestructible beast that resembled a [[black]], oozing mound and was capable of causing people to be overcome by a violent rage by simply touching them with its tendrils. Over one hundred years earlier, it had attacked the Tarasin and they had [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] it in [[Cloud Mountain cavern|a cave]] beneath the surface of Cularin. Muun decided to find the creature, but was unable to discover the exact location of its cave.<ref name=\"Force Concession\" />\n\nA group of construction workers who were building a [[bridge]] for a racecourse inadvertently unearthed the cave. Muun learned of their discovery and, in the middle of the night while the workers were sleeping, arrived at the construction site with a group of her battle [[Droid/Legends|droids]]. She left the droids to secure the site while she entered the cavern, confident that she would be able to find the t'salak. Inside, she encountered a series of obstacles that the Tarasin had placed inside the cave to prevent anyone from freeing the t'salak, including a deep chasm, a large boulder that blocked the path, and a concealed door. After passing all of these obstacles, Muun entered another tunnel, but soon found her way blocked by another obstruction: a wall of roots and vines. She tried to cut them down with her lightsaber, but the roots and vines regenerated every time she sliced through them, because the obstacle had been engineered by the Tarasin to allow only people who had never touched the dark side of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to get through. Being a Dark Jedi, Muun was therefore unable to pass the wall.<ref name=\"Force Concession\" />\n\nFurious, Muun left the t'salak cave and took her anger out on the construction workers,<ref name=\"Force Concession\" /> capturing them and taking them back to her base on Tilnes.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" /> Determined to obtain the t'salak, she decided to try and persuade the Tarasin into helping her releasing it. She disguised herself as a male Human Jedi and traveled to the [[Jaraana irstat]], a Tarasin tribe that lived in a village about fifty [[Kilometer/Legends|kilometers]] from the cave. Upon her arrival, she approached [[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]] [[Morad'Ka]], the eldest woman in the village, and asked the Tarasin to accompany her to the cave, which Muun claimed would be for the good of the system. Morad'Ka [[Force sense/Legends|sensed]] through the Force that something was not right about the request and refused. This made Muun very angry, and she stormed out of the village, screaming curses at the Tarasin. The next day, she returned to the village<ref name=\"Force Concession\" /> and used explosives<ref name=\"Force Convention\" /> to set fire to it<ref name=\"Force Concession\" /> in an attempt to destroy the settlement.<ref name=\"Force Convention\" /> The fire caused a great deal of damage to the structures in the village<ref name=\"Force Concession\" /> and aided Muun by creating a sense of apprehension among the Tarasin toward the Jedi, whom the Jaraana believed had caused the fire.<ref name=\"Force Convention\" />\n\n===Impersonating Nek Lawsirk===\n{{Quote|Hello Nek. It's been a while, hasn't it? Longer for me than for you, of course. I heard you were looking into some&hellip; incidents&hellip; and I can lend a hand.|Raik Muun, in a holographic message to Nek Lawsirk|Force Contention}}\nNot put off by her initial failure to obtain the t'salak, Muun began to pursue a different plan to acquire the creature. The Almas Jedi had sent Nek Lawsirk, who was now a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], to ask Morad'Ka to allow them study the creature. Morad'Ka agreed to Lawsirk's request and said that she would give him the creature when she felt that the time was right. Muun learned of the agreement and planned to capture Lawsirk, then collect the t'salak herself. She disguised herself as a Jedi and, over the course of a few weeks, committed various illegal acts on Cularin, such as charging citizens for protection. As a result, rumors began to circulate around Cularin, attributing Muun's actions to the Jedi and causing the local inhabitants to perceive the Order as being violent and cruel.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" />\n\nLawsirk heard the rumors and began investigating the cause of them, but, after a week of searching, was unable to discover anything. Muun sent him a [[Hologram/Legends|holo-message]] and, in it, claimed that she could reveal to him information about the rumors if he came and met her. She then asked him to travel to Tilnes and told him the location of the chemical plant where she was based. Although he distrusted her, Lawsirk did not want to pass up the opportunity to learn more about the rumors, so he traveled to the Tilnes plant to meet with Muun. Muun waited on a catwalk in a darkened room to ambush Lawsirk, who eventually arrived there. Muun's battle droids opened fire on the Zabrak, and he responded by igniting his lightsaber and jumping up onto the catwalk. Muun disarmed him using her own saber and pushed him into an empty chemical vat, where she then imprisoned him.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" />\n\nWith Lawsirk captured, Muun took his lightsaber and used theatrical makeup to disguise herself as him. She traveled to the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Hedrett]] on Cularin and, based out of [[Apartment 8|Lawsirk's apartment]] there, inflicted several unlawful acts against the local population to further undermine the peaceful reputation of the Jedi. While in the disguise, she demanded [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]] for protection from people, and also staged an attack on [[The Chasm]], a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] that was located in the nearby city of [[Gadrin]]. She placed a [[Holorecorder/Legends|holorecorder]] inside the building's [[Refresher/Legends|refresher]], which she hoped would be found by one of the cantina's patrons, ensuring that the attack was recorded. Muun then entered the cantina and waited for someone to come out of the refresher with the holorecorder. A few minutes later, the [[Kubaz/Legends|Kubaz]] [[Forg F'lopo]] emerged with it and began using it to film his friends. Muun immediately flipped over the table next to her and attacked the cantina's patrons with Lawsirk's lightsaber. She [[Cho mok|cut off]] a number of [[Limb/Legends|arms and legs]] and also [[Death/Legends|killed]] a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]]. When she had finished, she apologized to the survivors for the mess and dropped a handful of [[Credit chip/Legends|credit chips]] onto the floor, which she claimed were to cover the cost of the cleaning. F'lopo filmed the whole attack, and the footage was confiscated by the [[Office of Peace and Security]].<ref name=\"Force Contention\" />\n\nMorad'Ka eventually decided to let the Jedi study the t'salak, so she sent a message to Lawsirk, telling him that he could go and collect it. Muun intercepted the message and, while still disguised as the Zabrak, traveled to the Jaraana irstat to collect the creature. She arrived in the evening and took the creature from Morad'Ka straight away, refusing to share refreshments with the elderly Tarasin. After bringing the creature to the factory on Tilnes, Muun returned to Hedrett and used a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to kidnap three [[Scientist/Legends|biologists]] from a lab that was used by [[Culpharm]], a local pharmaceutical company. She took them back to Tilnes with her and forced them to try and find a way to make t'salak reproduce. While the biologists were present, she also repeatedly allowed the t'salak to touch Nek Lawsirk with its tentacles, causing him to become enraged.<ref name=\"Force Contention\" />\n\nEventually, the biologists developed a technique using [[Laser/Legends|lasers]] that allowed them to split the t'salak into two individual creatures. As she believed that the biologists had now served their purpose, Muun tied them up with [[Spacer's tape/Legends|spacer's tape]] and told them that she was going to kill them. However, Master Kirlocca had hired a group of freelance agents known as the \"[[Heroes of Cularin]]\" to find Lawsirk, and they had tracked the Zabrak to the factory. They entered the plant, and Muun was alerted to their presence. Muun abandoned the biologists and fled the factory<ref name=\"Force Contention\" /> with both t'salaks and a set of notes that the biologists had written about how make the creatures divide.<ref name=\"Force Convention\" />\n\n===Attack on the ''Luxury''===\n{{Quote|Forces in the system are conspiring against us. By \"us\" I mean the Jedi, the residents of the system and yourselves. I believe that Raik Muun, the Dark Jedi who's been giving us so much trouble, is responsible.|Jedi Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk, to the Heroes of Cularin|Force Convention}}\nMuun used the biologists' notes to further split the t'salak so that she had five individual creatures, each as strong as the original. When she learned of a peace conference that was going to be held between the Almas Jedi and the [[Sentient Beings Opposing Violence]], she realized that this was the opportunity she had been waiting for to discredit the Jedi. The conference was to be held aboard the [[Luxury liner/Legends|liner]] ''[[Luxury]]'' close to [[Rennokk]], a moon of Cularin. Muun plotted to use the t'salaks to enrage the attending Jedi and cause them to attack the delegates and planned to film and broadcast the event to the [[HoloNet/Legends|holonews]]. To implement her scheme, Muun disguised herself and adopted the alias \"Lernia\". Using several forged letters of recommendation from notable [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]], \"Lernia\" was able to secure a job as the co-pilot of the ''Luxury'' for the duration of the conference, and through her new position, she was able to smuggle her t'salaks and battle droids onto the [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. Muun also hired the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Coar Maw]] while disguised as a scarred [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]], and employed him to delay the Heroes of Cularin from further interfering with her plans. In an additional attempt to slow down the agents, Muun told [[Razor Leader]], the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] of a [[Thaereian military]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] that had been assigned to defend the ''Luxury'', that a ship would attempt to dock with the liner and that the craft's crew would attempt to sabotage the conference. She also claimed that the crew of this ship would have credentials showing that they had been sent by a high-ranking individual on Cularin, which she hoped would persuade the Thaereians to prevent the agents from boarding the liner should the agents learn of her plans and attempt to stop her.<ref name=\"Force Convention\" />\n\nThe agents eventually defeated Maw and were sent by Jedi Master [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]], the headmaster of the Almas Academy, to prevent Muun from disrupting the conference on the ''Luxury''. Their ship approached the liner and, in the guise of Lernia, Muun contacted Razor Leader, insisting that the Thaereian squadron destroy the agents' starship. Razor Leader disagreed and planned to let the agents dock with the ''Luxury'', so Muun used a mind trick on the liner's gunner and ordered him to open fire on the Thaereian starfighters and the agents' ship. Realizing that she had run out of time, Muun set her plan to disrupt the conference in motion and started by killing all of the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] crew on the liner, except for the [[Captain/Legends|captain]], [[Veer]]. She tied Veer up with spacer's tape and attached an explosive device to him, forcing him to fly the ''Luxury'' in the direction of Rennokk. Muun also ensured that the ship was inside the moon's [[Gravity well/Legends|gravity well]] so that even if the Thaereians opened fire on it, the ship would continue its descent towards the moon. She jettisoned all of the liner's [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pods]] except one and released the t'salak from two canisters that she had placed inside the ship's conference room. The creatures began to attack the attendees, sending them into violent, uncontrollable rages. Jedi Master Kirlocca and two Jedi [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] attempted to fight the creatures, but one of the Padawans became enraged and slew the other one. A [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] reporter then picked up the lightsaber of the fallen Jedi and went on a rampage, attacking the other delgates with it. With the Rodian and the rogue Padawan attacking the other attendees, it appeared as if the Jedi were deliberately attacking the delegates. Seeing her chance, Muun activated a news feed that started broadcasting live images of the attack to the holomedia. She also sent a group of battle droids to the ship's [[Engineer/Legends|engineering]] section to damage the ''Luxury''{{'s}} systems and ensure that its course was unable to be altered.<ref name=\"Force Convention\" />\n\nThe Heroes of Cularin eventually landed on the ''Luxury'', and Muun began monitoring them to keep track of their actions. She tried to slow their movements aboard the liner by initiating an [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmospheric]] evacuation of the [[Hangar/Legends|landing bay]] while the agents were disembarking from their ship. The agents were able to stop the evacuation and made their way into the engineering section, where they defeated the droids that Muun had sent there and repaired some of the damaged systems. They then made their way to the conference room, where they subdued the t'salak, although not before Kirlocca was finally overcome by the creatures and was killed. The agents confronted Muun on the bridge, and she engaged them in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|combat]]. Despite her desire to kill them for foiling her plans, she did not fight recklessly and remained fully in control of her actions. However, despite her efforts, the fight began to go against her. She fled and escaped in the last remaining pod, which she flew to a location where a getaway ship was waiting for her.<ref name=\"Force Convention\" />\n\n===Student of Inquisitor Draco===\n{{Quote|Come at me one at a time or all at once. All shall pass from this world.|Raik Muun|Echoes of the Jedi}}\n[[File:Valin_Draco.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Valin Draco, the Imperial Inquisitor who took Raik Muun as his apprentice]]\nMuun eventually returned to her base on Tilnes. While there, she heard reports of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]],<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" /> [[Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150|an order]] that had been issued by [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] to the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic's]] [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] telling them to kill all of the Jedi.<ref name=\"EpIII\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Believing that the issuing of the order had denied her the chance to gain revenge on the Jedi, Muun decided to confront the people responsible for the deaths of the Jedi. To do this, she traveled to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], the newly-formed galactic government that had replaced the Republic. On Coruscant, however, she instead found [[Valin Draco]], a [[Dark Side Adept]] who was a member of the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]], an order of [[Jedi hunter/Legends|Jedi hunters]] serving the Empire. Draco saw great potential in Muun and asked her to join him. She accepted, as she believed that she had finally found someone to love her.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" />\n\nAfter becoming Draco's apprentice, Muun accompanied Draco on various assignments, relishing in the opportunities to hunt Jedi that they provided. When Draco was sent to investigate a [[Force nexus]] on Almas<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" /> in circa [[17 BBY/Legends|17 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">''Echoes of the Jedi'' states that Vhiin Thorla traveled to the Almas Academy two years after the declaration of Order 66, which is dated to [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. This thus indicates that ''Dawn of Defiance'' is set in circa 17 BBY.</ref> he brought Muun along with him, as he believed that her familiarity with the planet would be helpful to the mission. After arriving in the Cularin system, Draco, Muun, and some Imperial support [[Troop/Legends|troops]] flew to Almas in a [[Theta-class T-2c shuttle/Legends|''Theta''-class shuttle]] and landed in the city of [[Forard]]. From there, they made their way to the Academy, which lay in ruins as a result of [[Destruction of the Almas Academy|an attack]] near the end of the Clone Wars. Inside, Draco and Muun encountered the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] Jedi Master [[Vhiin Thorla]] and his Padawan, [[Dorv'Tilsta]], who had both come to the Academy in search of other Jedi survivors of the Empire's [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Jedi purge]]. A fierce [[Duel in the Almas Academy|lightsaber duel]] ensued, and Muun used a t'salak to induce a murderous rage in Tilsta, causing the boy to attack his master. Thorla was forced to kill Tilsta, but in doing so became so overcome by guilt that he was weakened, allowing Draco and Muun to capture him.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" />\n\nShortly afterward, Draco discovered [[Darth Rivan's holocron|the holocron]] of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Rivan]] in the Academy sublevels and chose to remain there to study it. Muun stayed with him, but while the two were there, a group of [[Alderaanian Resistance]] agents [[Mission to Almas|came]] to the Academy ruins in search of the [[Qornah Holocron]], a Jedi [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]] that had been kept in the Academy. However, Draco had already located the Qornah Holocron and had taken it with him to the sublevels. The agents made their way there to confront him and approached Draco. Muun flanked her Master and ignited her lightsaber in preparation to defend him. The agents attacked Draco, and Muun took up a defensive position in front of him, while four [[Clone shadow trooper/Legends|clone shadow troopers]], elite Imperial troops that served Draco, prepared to ambush the Resistance team. Once the agents had moved close enough to them, Muun and the shadow troopers engaged them in melee combat. However, Muun and the troopers were eventually incapacitated by the agents. Draco was defeated, and the agents left the Academy with the Qornah Holocron.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|We thought we'd be freed&hellip; but&hellip; then she said we'd served our purpose and now it was time to die.|A Culpharm biologist, speaking about Raik Muun|Force Contention}}\nRaik Muun had [[red]] hair and [[Green (disambiguation)|green]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"Force Convention\" /> She lacked control over her emotions and desires, making her unsuited for Jedi training and quick to anger.
