His father was a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] in the elite [[Scimitar assault wing]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|He is our local boy, Dravis. He'a a bit of a scoundrel, but he'll teach you to fly just fine.|[[Mayor/Legends|Mayor]] [[Mikdanyell Guh'rantt]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter he graduated from the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]], it was rumored that Dravis stole a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] and fled to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] to avoid supporting a child he had fathered.<ref name=\"TTS\">''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nDuring [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Dravis was one of the smugglers in [[Talon Karrde]]'s early version of [[Smugglers' Alliance]]. He operated out of the [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Mos Eisley cantina]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], and tasked another Smugglers' Alliance pilot with a series of missions. These missions involved defending the [[Tatoo system/Legends|Tatoo system]] from [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]], and securing shipments from [[Commerce Raiders]] and other aggressive entities.<ref name=\"SWG:JTL\" />\n\n[[File:DravisKrayt.jpg|left|thumb|Dravis' M22-T]]\nLater, Dravis agreed to grant passage for a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[entertainer]] named [[Ex]] and a [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] named [[Sh'ira]] to the city of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] for 100,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. After Ex [[Death/Legends|killed]] an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] outside the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley Spaceport]] in anger, Ex and her friend were desperate to escape the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] in order to evade arrest.

When Han set out in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]] to hire smugglers to help alleviate the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]] shortfall of [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]] and [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]], it was Dravis that Han contacted first. Dravis gave Han the New Republic's first warning about [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], though he was unaware of the actual identity of the new Imperial leader. He also let Han know that the low-key [[Talon Karrde]] actually ran the largest smuggling organization in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].\n\nLater, Dravis was assigned by Karrde to help track down Thrawn's secret [[Wayland]]cloning facility]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Jump to Lightspeed}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?id=66841&resource=features|text=Imperial Entanglements|archivedate=20111124014259}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Last Command]]''\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{GamerCite|3|The Smuggler's Alliance}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=content.jsp?page=Jump%20to%20Lightspeed:%20Getting%20started%20as%20a%20Privateer:%20Part%20II|text=Jump to Lightspeed: Getting started as a Privateer: Part II|archivedate=20041014113316}} <!-- 2004-10-01 -->\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=68381&month=072009|text=Friday Feature - Leveling your new character.
