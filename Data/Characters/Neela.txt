There, she gave birth to her second son, [[Pqweeduk]], and raised the boys in the more peaceful ways of their clan. She tried to shelter Greedo and Pqweeduk from their violent past, but thirteen years later Greedo discovered one of the hidden colony ships and wanted to know more. Soon afterward, Navik and other [[Chattza Clan]] hunters found the refugees, slaughtering them. Neela, her sons, her brothers, and a few remnants of the clan barely got away, relocating to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Neela hoped to eventually move them into the protection of [[Avaro Sookcool]].<ref name=\"New Essential Guide to Characters\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref>\n\n===Nar Shaddaa===\nNeela found work as a housekeeper and lived in the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]] on [[Level 88]] with her family and remaining clanmembers. The Rodian refugees remained there for four years, during which young Greedo grew into a petty street kid. As Greedo was following along with the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] [[Spurch Goa|Spurch \"Warhog\" Goa]] and [[Dyyz Nataz]], an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] attack was initiated, sending Level 88 ablaze. Neela and most of the clanmembers were killed, leaving Greedo an orphan.<ref name=\"New Essential Guide to Characters\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)|''A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale'' webstrip]]\n*{{Tales|14|The Emperor's Court}} {{Nc}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|greedo|Greedo|id=eu|archivedate=20100414132600}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Neela\n|hu=Neela\n|ru=\u041d\u0438\u043b\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Tetsu Clan]]"}}}]}}}}
