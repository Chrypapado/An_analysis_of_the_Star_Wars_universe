His membership in the [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] was brought about by equal parts piloting skill and political concession. The [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] wished to keep the [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] cartels happy and so put one person from each corporation on the squadron. Though dedicated to the New Republic cause, Bror was an arrogant man who was convinced that he was the most skilled of Rogue Squadron's new recruits. Throughout his time in the squadron, he found a rival and equal as a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] in [[Corran Horn]], whom Bror regarded as the only new pilot in the squadron who could truly compete with him. In the end, Bror won the rivalry with twenty-two kills to Corran's twenty-one.\n\nAfter the [[Second Battle of Borleias]], Bror received a message from home, saying that the family patriarch was dying. En route, however, his [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] was pulled from [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Immobilizer 418 cruiser/Legends|Interdictor cruiser]] [[Corusca Rainbow|''Black Asp'']] and destroyed. This, the rest of the squadron would later find out, was a ruse to bring him home to work with the [[Ashern]] rebels within Zaltin to plan a civil war against [[Xucphra Corporation|Xucphra]], Zaltin's rival, and [[Ysanne Isard]].\n\nJace rejoined Rogue Squadron to help bring down Isard and free his home planet. He flew with the squadron during its battle with the ''Lusankya''. After the Rogue's victory at Thyferra, when [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and the rest of the squadron were making their choices on whether they were going to stay with the squadron, Jace chose to leave the squadron again to head the formation of a [[Thyferran Aerospace Defense Force]].\n[[File:BrorJace-SWG5.jpg|thumb|right|Rogue Four, Bror Jace]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}}\n*{{FFCite|14|ROG2, ''X-wing Rogue Squadron''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 26]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Rogue Four/Legends|Rogue Four]]\n|years=[[6 ABY/Legends|6.5 ABY]]\n|before=[[Xarcce Huwla]]\n|after=[[Pash Cracken]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Bror Jace\n|de=Bror Jace\n|es=Bror Jace\n|fi=Bror Jace\n|pl=Bror Jace\n|ru=\u0411\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0414\u0436\u0430\u0441\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jace, Bror}}\n[[Category:Antilles's Rogues]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rogue Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Thyferrans]]"}}}]}}}}
