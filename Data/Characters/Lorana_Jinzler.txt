She had dark [[Hair/Legends|hair]], [[Color/Legends|gray]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and was of medium height.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLorana's [[Parent/Legends|parents]] were both employees at the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. When she was born and taken in by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], her parents were dismissed in accordance with the Jedi Code regarding emotional attachments and relationships. Her parents kept track of her progressive Jedi training from a friend who still worked at the Temple. The third of four [[Jinzler family|Jinzler children]], Lorana was accepted for [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]] at the age of 10 months, and was taken to the Temple, only meeting her jealous, hurt brother [[Dean Jinzler|Dean]] at the initiation of [[Outbound Flight]].<ref name=\"Outbound Flight\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']]</ref>\n\nOften surprised by her master's gruff tone and high expectations, [[Jorus C'baoth]] and Lorana weren't as close as other [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] and their [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]]. Lorana was often unsure of the Jedi's role, unlike her master, who believed Jedi had the power and inherent role to rule others who were not [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], and watch over them.\n\n===Mission to Barlok===\nShortly before she became a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], Lorana and C'baoth were sent on a mission to the planet of [[Barlok]]. They met with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his Padawan, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]. C'baoth sent them away while he attended a meeting. Later, Lorana was captured by terrorists, but was rescued by Kenobi and Skywalker. The next day she attempted to stop the missile that was sent to destroy the negotiators, but failed. Her master, however, destroyed it.\n\nAt age 22, Lorana was promoted to the level of Jedi Knight shortly before the launch of the Outbound Flight, although this was due to the fact Master Jorus C'boath wanted her to come with him on the Outbound Flight.\n\n===Outbound Flight project===\nLorana was selected for the Outbound Flight exploration mission by her master. She was far more reasonable and humble than C'baoth, and during the initial stages of the flight, she could usually be found trying to appease the disgruntled passengers.\n\nWhen Outbound Flight was attacked in warning by [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], many lives unintentionally perished and Lorana felt C'baoth's fall to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. She tried to reach her former master in time to help him but she sensed his death by the second wave of assault droids. When the outer ships were mostly destroyed by [[Kinman Doriana]], the only survivors were Lorana and the fifty-seven passengers C'baoth had imprisoned in the central storage core.\n\nWhile attempting to save the ship, Lorana met [[Syndic/Legends|Syndic]] [[Mitth'ras'safis/Legends|Thrass]], who was Thrawn's brother, and [[Jorj Car'das]] on the bridge of [[Dreadnaught-One|D-One]]. She and Thrass had planned to land the ship on a planetoid in [[The Redoubt/Legends|The Redoubt]], with [[Dreadnaught-Three|D-Three]] on the top, allowing them to use the small ship there to get aid. But the surviving passengers had moved to [[Dreadnaught-Four|D-Four]]. With no other choice but to land D-One on the bottom to save the colonists, Lorana and Thrass chose to sacrifice their lives for the survivors in D-Four.\n\n===Legacy===\nNearly fifty years after her death, her brother [[Expedition to Outbound Flight|traveled]] to the wreckage of Outbound Flight with the Jedi [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] when it was rediscovered by the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]]. Her skeletal remains were found next to [[Mitth'ras'safis/Legends|Mitth'ras'safis's]] remains in one of the cockpits of the Outbound Flight Project.\n\nLorana Jinzler was also remembered by one of the Survivors of Outbound Flight, [[Jorad Pressor]], who had known her as Jedi Lorana back when he was a child. It was for this reason that Dean Jinzler was released from a trap that was set by the Survivors to try resolving the problem diplomatically.\n\nLorana wielded a green [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], with an amethyst gem in the place of the activation stud (this gem had, unbeknownst to Lorana, been a gift from her parents). [[Lorana's lightsaber|This lightsaber]] was recovered by Luke Skywalker, but was later destroyed.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be able to please him.|Lorana regarding her master Jorus C'baoth|Outbound Flight (novel)}}\nLorana was humble and good-natured. However, she lacked self-confidence, something which was not helped by working with Jorus C'baoth, who was very sure of himself, and expected any Padawan of his to feel the same. Obi-Wan Kenobi recognized this, and attempted to make her feel that she belonged and should not feel so unsure when the two worked together briefly. Lorana was a caring person, evidenced by the way she sacrificed herself to save the survivors of ''Outbound Flight''. She was sorry her brother disliked her, telling him to let go of his anger. Decades later, Dean managed to come to peace with her death, revealing to himself that he really loved her.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']]\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' {{1st}} {{C|Skeletal remains}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lorana Jinzler\n|es=Lorana Jinzler\n|pl=Lorana Jinzler\n|ru=\u041b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0440\n|fi=Lorana Jinzler\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jinzler, Lorana}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
