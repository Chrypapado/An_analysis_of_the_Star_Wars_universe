Like most Ganks, Gorran's body had been augmented over time by [[cybernetics]]. During his career, Gorran became indebted to [[Giarda]] of the [[Jiramma]] [[Kajidic/Legends|kajidic]]. While on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], Gorran partnered with the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Nell]] on a job to recover a [[Sakiyan]] informant and pay off his debts to Giarda, by collecting a bounty placed by the [[Gorensla/Legends|Gorensla]] clan. When both Gorran and Nell were stopped in the streets by Giarda and her guards, the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] manipulated the pair into working for her, allowing Gorran and Nell to proposed turning over [[Razall]] over to her in exchange for a clean slate for their debt. When the pair successfully captured Razall, Giarda followed through on her promise of forgiving their debts, privately gloating on her accomplishment of twisting them back into her service.<ref name=\"LoNH\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Lords of Nal Hutta]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Ganks]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
