Once she was the subject of a kidnapping threat, and was placed under the protection of [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] agents [[Corran Horn]] and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]]. While Wessiri tracked down and apprehended the would-be kidnapper, Horn stayed hidden with Siolle, and the two shared a brief romance that bloomed when they realized they had the same tastes in art. However, they both recognized that a relationship wouldn't work, and so parted ways soon after.\n\nSiolle enjoyed going to spas on [[Selonia/Legends|Selonia]] and art exhibits on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tinta, Siolle}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
