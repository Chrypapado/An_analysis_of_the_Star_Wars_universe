The spirit became a guard of a [[Cloud Mountain Wyrd enclave|Wyrd enclave]] on the [[Volcano/Legends|volcano]] [[Cloud Mountain]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] and attacked a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] that ventured to Cloud Mountain to challenge the witches. However, the [[Tarasin]] spirit was assaulted and vanquished by the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[The Force/Legends|Force]] ghost [[Risstenni]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Tarasin]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] and became a [[Force Adept]].<ref name=\"From The Trees\" /> Around [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\" /> the Tarasin was targeted by the [[Wyrd]], a [[Coven/Legends|coven]] of Tarasin [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Witch/Legends|witches]], and placed within the [[Hand artifact]], an ancient [[dark side artifact]] situated in a [[Cloud Mountain Wyrd enclave|cavern]] on the dormant Cularin [[Volcano/Legends|volcano]] [[Cloud Mountain]]. The Hand artifact allowed its users to enhance their own strength by drawing on the life force of a victim placed within; the Tarasin was subjected to this rite and [[Death/Legends|killed]], transforming her into a [[Force ghost|dark side spirit]]. The Tarasin Force Adept's ghost subsequently lingered at the Wyrd enclave on Cloud Mountain, serving the witches as a guard to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] relic that had taken her life.<ref name=\"From The Trees\" />\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] colony [[Kiirloor]] close to Cloud Mountain, the Wyrd schemed to use the Hand artifact to trigger a volcanic eruption from Cloud Mountain and wipe the settlement away. A group of [[Heroes of Cularin|freelance agents]] arrived at the Wyrd enclave to challenge the witches and the Tarasin spirit determined to prevent the operatives from interfering with the Wyrd's plans to activate the volcano.<ref name=\"From The Trees\" />\n\nAs the agents conversed with [[Risstenni]], a Wookiee turned into a Force ghost by the Hand artifact, the Tarasin spirit manifested nearby. In an attempt to lure the operatives to the dark side of the Force, the Tarasin proclaimed her lamentation of the fate that had befallen her and the other victims of the Hand artifact and dared the agents to attack the Wyrd witches. A fight soon broke out between the Tarasin spirit and the freelance operatives and the Tarasin attempted to possess one of the agents. After some time, Risstenni joined the fracas and pounced upon the spirit, allowing the agents to pass and confront the Wyrd witches. The two spirits became locked in combat and the Tarasin spirit was eventually defeated and vanquished by the Wookiee ghost.<ref name=\"From The Trees\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nFollowing her transcendence into the form of a dark side spirit, the Tarasin retained many of the mental attributes that she had held in life. As a spirit she was invulnerable to physical attacks.<ref name=\"From The Trees\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Tarasin spirit was familiar with the use of the Force to [[Mind trick/Legends|cast illusions]] and to influence the minds of others.<ref name=\"From The Trees\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Tarasin dark side spirit appeared within ''[[From the Trees]]'', a [[2003]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] adventure by [[Ed Gibson]] and set within [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity that formed part of [[RPGA]]'s [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign. In the adventure, the players roleplay as the freelance agents that the spirit encounters on Cloud Mountain. The Tarasin ghost attempts to possess the player character that is most concerned by the plight of the Wookiees of Kiirloor, or alternatively the player character most moved by the spirit's speech to the agents, or otherwise just a random member of the group.
