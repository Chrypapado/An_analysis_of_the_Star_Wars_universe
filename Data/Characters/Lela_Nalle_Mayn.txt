As one of the [[Nalle triplets]] she worked for the corrupt [[Mayor/Legends|Mayor]] [[Acros-Krik]] as a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] and was in the [[Outlander Club/Legends|Outlander Club]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] before the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|outbreak]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]. Of the three sisters she was the only one to be [[Marriage/Legends|married]] at that time. She was also the [[Parent/Legends|mother]] of [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Todra Mayn]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLela Nalle Mayn was one of three Outlander Club patrons portrayed by [[Amy Allen]] in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']]. The name Lela Mayn is an [[Wikipedia:anagram|anagram]] of \"Amy Allen.\" It was initially unknown whether Lela was the third Nalle triplet, but the appearance of one of the sisters in ''[[Evasive Action: Recruitment]]'' being very much like her costume in ''Attack of the Clones'' strongly suggested it. Lela Mayn's entry in [[StarWars.com]]'s [[Databank (original)|original Databank]] later confirmed that she was the third triplet, with Mayn being her married name.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Evasive Action: Recruitment]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night}}\n*{{DB|character|lelamayn|Mayn, Lela Nalle|archivedate=20100202123346}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lela Nalle Mayn\n|nl=Lela Mayn\n|pl=Lela Nalle Mayn\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nalle Mayn, Lela}}\n[[Category:Commenori]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
