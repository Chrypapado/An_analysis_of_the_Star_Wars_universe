During his [[Time/Legends|time]] on the planet, he visited the [[swoop track]] that Kaitoova frequented. After several races, Revan became the new champion of the track, dethroning [[Zoriis Bafka]]. Kaitoova waited outside the track, and when Revan emerged, he approached the new champion and asked for his [[autoprint]]. Initially, Revan was confused, but agreed to give his autoprint to Kaitoova. He thanked Revan, and told him that they would see eachother again. Despite this, Kaitoova did not speak to Revan again during his time on Tatooine.<ref name= \"KOTOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\nGanda Kaitoova appeared as a non-player character in the [[2003]]<ref name=\"KOTOR Date\">{{SW|url=news/kotor-galaxy-of-heroes|text=BioWare and Capital Games on Bringing ''KotOR'' Fan Favorites into ''Galaxy of Heroes''}}</ref> [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]].'' He appears only in a cutscene, which will always be triggered if the player becomes the Tatooine swoop champion. There are multiple dialogue options within the cutscene, although none of them change alignment, and the player can refuse to give out an autoprint. If the player does not become the champion, then Kaitoova is not present in any capacity.<ref name= \"KOTOR\" />\n\n{{Interlang\n|fi=Ganda Kaitoova\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kaitoova, Ganda}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
