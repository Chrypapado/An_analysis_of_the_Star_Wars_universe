When Thok, who was the reason why Gorc was no longer with them, learned this, he grew uncomfortable. When things got inevitably worse during the [[Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon]], resulting in Thok's death in a backfired ambush attempt on [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], Scumbo arrived at Thok's corpse, with [[Vibro-ax/Legends|vibro-ax]] in tow. Although he briefly sneered at him, he then started squealing the war cry to bid Thok safe passage across the Great Trough of the Stars just as Jabba's [[Sail barge/Legends|sail barge]], the [[Khetanna/Legends|''Khetanna'']], exploded around them.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/barely-tolerable-alien-henchmen-of-the-empire-part-2|text=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2|int=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire}}\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
