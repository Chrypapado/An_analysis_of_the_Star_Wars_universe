He regularly traded with [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] such as [[Het Nkik/Legends|Het Nkik]]. Reegesk was not picky, and was willing to steal anything, even trash. His tribe needed power for their bootleg [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|vaporator]] unit, so he went into [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] to look for a power source. He attempted to trade a [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]] battle idol to Nkik in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], during which he quietly stole the power source of Nkik's [[BlasTech Industries/Legends|BlasTech Industries]] [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol/Legends|DL-44]] for use with his tribe's vaporator, leading to the death of Nkik, not knowing his gun had no power during a shootout with [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nReegesk was played by [[Sadie Eden]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Swap Meet: The Jawa's Tale]]''\n*''[[Trade Wins: The Ranat's Tale]]''\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Reegesk}}\n*{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Light/large/hetnkik.gif|cardname=Het Nkik}}\n*{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Dark/large/reegesk.gif|cardname=Reegesk}}\n*''[[Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2005)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]\n*{{SWArchive|url=movies/episode-iv/20081027.html?page=5|text=Cantina Roll-Call: Shedding Light on Some Alien Aliases - And the Band Played On|int=Cantina Roll-Call: Shedding Light on Some Alien Aliases|archivedate=20090415052553}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|124|Jedi Archive: Rarely Seen Images from the Lucasfilm Archives|Jedi Archive}}\n*{{InsiderCite|130|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: The Unusual Suspects: Who's Who in Mos Eisley}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Reegesk\n|nl=Reegesk\n|pt=Legends:Reegesk\n|ru=\u0420\u0438\u0433\u0435\u0441\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ranats]]\n[[Category:Scavengers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
