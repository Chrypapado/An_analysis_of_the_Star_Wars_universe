Here, he had his own office, not far from Tour Aryon's. In [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Wilhalm also found himself working closely with [[Prefect]] [[Eugene Talmont]], who also worked in the capitol building. During his time as secretary, Wilhalm came into contact with a local [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]], who was interested in assisting the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. Fortunately for the spacer, Wilhalm had a number of jobs that had to be completed. Wilhalm informed the spacer that [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]] had stolen one of his reports. Wilhalm needed the spacer to find the report before the Rebels encrypted it. The spacer, who wanted to gain Wilhalm's trust and gain an appointment with Talmont, agreed to carry out the task. The spacer tracked down the Rebel named [[Dak Linser]] and killed the individual.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nThe spacer returned the report to Wilhalm. Though Wilhalm appreciated the spacer's service, he still had work for him to complete before an appointment with Talmont could be scheduled. An informant to Wilhalm, a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] named [[Nethlek'Vaa]], found information of great importance for the Empire. However, Wilhalm felt that Nethlek'Vaa was asking for an outrageous sum of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] in return for the information. Wilhalm, annoyed by his informant's persistence, instructed the spacer to track down Nethlek'Vaa. The spacer tracked down Nethlek'Vaa, who was being guarded by two Rebels. The spacer had no choice but to kill all three of them, and return the information to Wilhalm.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nWilhalm had one final task for the spacer, after which he promised the spacer his appointment with Talmont. [[Ananda Dwyce]], one of the Prefect's clerks, made the decision to flee Bestine, and defect to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]]. Wilhalm needed the spacer to find Ananda, and arrest her, so that his office could escape considerable embarrassment. Since there was no time to waste, the spacer immediately set out to find Ananda before she could escape. Fortunately for Wilhalm, the spacer managed to locate Ananda, who was being escorted by two Rebels. The spacer immediately killed the two escorts, but spared Ananda, so that she could be apprehended and executed.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nWilhalm was pleased by the spacer's continual support, and informed the spacer that Prefect Talmont could now meet with him.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWilhalm Skrim is a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. In the game, players must do a series of short quests for him, before being allowed to do quests for Prefect Talmont.\n\nHis name is based off of the [[Wilhelm scream]], a stock sound effect very common in the ''Star Wars ''franchise.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided Quick Reference Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Champions_of_the_Force#Card_gallery|cardname=Kill the Spy}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skrim, Wilhalm}}\n[[Category:Bureaucrats of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
