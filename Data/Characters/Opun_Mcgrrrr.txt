He was also the former owner of the [[Holiday Towers Hotel and Casino|Holiday Towers]] hotel on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], though [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] later took control.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], as a revenge for Jabba's coup for the Holiday Towers, he stole the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[CZ-3/Legends|CZ-3]] while staying as a guest at [[Desilijic Complex/Legends|Jabba's town house]] in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. His intentions were to take revenge on Jabba by gaining access to the secrets hidden in the droid. However, Jabba had foreseen this eventuality, and CZ-3 was spying on Mcgrrrr. The entire operation turned out to be a sting operation set up by Jabba.\n\nThis plan was foiled because the [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Aguilae]] and her partner, the [[Squib/Legends|Squib]] [[Macemillian-winduart\u00e9]], stole the droid from him (or, as they would claim, found or bought it after it malfunctioned and went wild). Mcgrrrr, infuriated, sent his [[Jenet/Legends|Jenet]] henchman [[Tols Vengra]] after the droid.\n\nVengra found the droid at the same time that Jabba's bounty hunter [[Takeel/Legends|Takeel]] did. While they were arguing, Takeel's brother [[Zutton/Legends|Zutton]] shot and destroyed the droid. However, in the process, CZ-3 had provided Jabba with enough evidence to expose Mcgrrrr and Vengra's plots against Jabba.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n==Behind the scenes==\nMcgrrrr's appearance was based on [[Declan Mulholland]], the actor who played a [[Heater (henchman)|Human version of Jabba the Hutt]] in a scene of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']]. Mulholland wore a similar costume in the movie [[Wikipedia:Time Bandits|''Time Bandits'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|11|Spare Parts (short story)|Spare Parts}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|droid|cz3|CZ-3 (Seezee-Three)|archivedate=20100330072154}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mcgrrrr, Opun}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]"}}}]}}}}
