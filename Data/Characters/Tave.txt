Ascending to the rank of [[Je'daii Master]], Tave was appointed as the assistant to Master [[Lha-Mi]], the [[Je'daii Temple Master]] of the Great Temple of Martial Arts, [[Stav Kesh]].<ref name=\"DotJ0\" /> Alongside Master [[Kin'ade]], Tave was one of the primary instructors at Stav Kesh, and oversaw the initial breathing exercises necessary to survive in the thin atmosphere of the [[Ice Giant Range]]. Stoic and patient, instruction on the lower balconies of the Temple generally consisted of Master Tave instructing his students to attack him, with rarely a strike landing. Master Tave's defense typically relied on traditional martial arts techniques, without using the Force to defend himself from his students during hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\"Into the Void\">''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]''</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Great Journey]] of [[Lanoree Brock|Lanoree]] and [[Dalien Brock]], Tave began their instruction alongside four other [[Je'daii Journeyer]]s. When it was apparent that Dalien was of middling Force ability, Tave took over his instruction in traditional fighting styles while Kin'ade oversaw the other's instruction in Force-based martial arts. During the final combat exercise in the Great Hall of Stav Kesh, Tave and Kin'ade stand alongside the battle ring prepared to use the Force to soften blows and prevent any real harm from befalling the Journeyers.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\nAs [[Sek'nos Rath]], [[Tasha Ryo]] and [[Shae Koda]] completed their Great Journey after the arrival of the [[Force Hound]] [[Tau (individual)|Xesh]] on Tython and his subsequent exile to the [[Bogan]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]], Tave instructed them in combat, training them with staffs. Cautioning them against dwelling too much on Xesh's exile and doubting the wisdom of the [[Je'daii Council]], Tave assured them that their concerns were being taken seriously by the [[Je'daii Temple Master|Temple Masters]] before dismissing them.<ref name=\"Force Storm 1\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 1]]</ref>\n\nAs the [[Infinite Empire]] launched an [[Invasion of the Tython system|invasion]] of the [[Tython system]], Tave donned black battle armor and wielded duel [[Forcesaber]]s in a reverse-grip style as he took to the battle field. Alongside Masters [[Tem Madog]] and [[Daegen Lok]], Tave participated in the [[Battle of Shikaakwa|battle]] of [[Shikaakwa]] where they ambushed the [[Flesh Raider]]s sent to attack [[Ryo Fortress]].<ref name=\"Force War 1\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 1]]</ref> After driving the Empire off Shikaakwa, the Je'daii gave chase to [[Ska Gora]] where they [[Attack on Ska Gora|engaged]] the Rakatan forces in violent combat. However, this was revealed to be a trap as the Rakatan forces ambushed the Je'daii task force and took many of them prisoner before encasing them in tubes in a chamber under the Rakatan fortress.<ref name=\"Force War 2\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 2]]</ref> Tave continued to fight on, even after the traitor Xesh caused psychic backlash among the Je'daii [[seer]]s and caused a flood of dark side energy to encourage the Flesh Raiders and sap the strength from the Je'daii. Ordered to fall back to Tython as the Balance was completed titled to the dark side, Tave regrouped with Master Madog as they fled Ska Gora.<ref name=\"Force War 3\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 3]]</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nA master of the Force, Tave was skilled in hand-to-hand combat, sword fighting, and other traditional methods of combat. Tave could use the Force to slip away and hide from the naked eye, to essentially disappear in the Force and shroud his physical presence and his signature in the Force.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" /> Tapping into the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] and leaning out of Balance, Tave was able to activate and wield dual [[Forcesaber]]s during the war with the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]].<ref name=\"Force War 1\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]''\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 1]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 1]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 2]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 3]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 4]] {{C|Picture only}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 5]] {{C|Picture only}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tave\n|fr=Tave\n|pl=Tave\n|ru=\u0422\u0435\u0439\u0432\n}}\n\n[[Category:Je'daii Masters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Noghri]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
