Once the shark is dead, we can get back to mining the Kolto.|Kono to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Kono Nolan''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] who worked for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] on [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring his work for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] on [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]], Nolan served as the chief [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] at the secret [[Hrakert Station]] on Manaan's [[Ocean/Legends|ocean]] floor as of [[3956 BBY]]. When it was overrun by insane [[Selkath/Legends|Selkath]] he, along with [[Sami (Human)|Sami]], was one of the few survivors that were saved by the amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] during his search for the [[Star Map]].\n\nDespite his position as a scientist for the Republic, Nolan was amoral, against believing the ethical consequences of his work. He advocated using an experimental poison to kill the [[Progenitor]], and was furious when Revan, following Sami's advice, chose to destroy the facility instead.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKono Nolan was voiced by [[Cam Clarke]].{{Fact}}\n\nIf the player takes the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] path, he can have Revan poison the Progenitor and/or kill either or both of the scientists. The consequences of releasing the poison, however, are profound; Revan is then banned from returning to Manaan and the general price of [[medkit]]s throughout the game goes up; alternately, if the dark-side player has enough skill in Persuade, Revan can revisit the planet, using his ability to convince the Selkath to keep the matter quiet.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|As \"Kono\"}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kono Nolan\n|pl=Kono Nolan\n|fi=Kono Nolan\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e \u041d\u043e\u043b\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nolan, Kono}}\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
