And here is ''why''. They fight for themselves. For their own petty desires. They fight to overturn the rightful order of things. We fight because we've already won. Because we ''are'' that rightful order. It's written in our blood and the blood of our brothers and sisters. We've spilled that blood into the dirt of every planet in the galaxy.

And you can never kill us all.|Kreel|Star Wars (2015) 37}}\n[[Sergeant]] '''Kreel''', designated '''Agent 5241''', was an undercover [[stormtrooper]] and [[Special Commando Advanced Recon Trooper|SCAR trooper]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], serving in the [[501st Legion]] under the direct command of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. He operated as the '''gamemaster''' in [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the [[Hutt]]'s [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|arena]] on [[Nar Shaddaa]]. He was tasked with training new candidates to fight in the arena, including [[Luke Skywalker]]. During Skywalker's arena fight with [[Kongo]] the Disemboweler, Agent 5241 contacted the Empire to inform them that Skywalker was on Nar Shaddaa. After his mission on Nar Shaddaa was complete, Kreel was given command of an elite group of [[Special Commando Advanced Recon Trooper|SCAR troopers]], designated [[Task Force 99]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Age of the Empire===\n{{Quote|I was doomed to die in the arena, just like my father had. Just like my mother and everyone I'd ever known. Until the stormtroopers came. Until the Empire made life worth living.|Kreel|Star Wars (2015) 21}}\nKreel was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Chagar IX]]. When [[Gender|he]] was four, Kreel watched a man [[Death|die]]. It made him cry like a baby for a dozen more times. Two [[Standard year|years]] later, Kreel watched [[Kreel's father|his own father]] being murdered in front of him, but he did not cry. His mother was also said to have died in the arenas. He then started to kill people and worked in the [[fighting pit]]s. Kreel made the fighting pits his way of life in order to survive. Sometime later when Kreel first saw the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[stormtrooper]]s, he viewed them as beautiful. After the Empire toppled Chagar IX's [[warlord]]s and shut down the fighting pits, Kreel and his people were given jobs, a sense of purpose, and peace. When he was old enough, Kreel joined the [[Stormtrooper Corps]].<ref name=\"SW21\" />\n\nHe went to the [[Imperial Academy]], where he befriended a ranger named [[Izak Anzio]] of [[Agamar]]. During their first mission together, Izak was killed by the Rebels' [[mortar]]s before their [[transport]] landed. Kreel then killed every Rebel he could find that day and vowed to continue doing so.<ref name=\"SW21\" /> Kreel eventually became a [[sergeant]] in the [[501st Legion]].<ref name=\"SW11\" />\n\n===Infiltrating Grakkus's Palace===\n{{Quote|You can call me the Gamemaster.

In his role, Kreel trained [[Wookiee]]s, [[lizard]] men and space [[pirate]]s to fight in the arena for Grakkus and his audience.<ref name=\"SW11\" /> He called himself the \"Gamemaster.\"<ref name=\"SW10\" />\n\nEventually, he was given [[Luke Skywalker]] to train for Grakkus's games. Along with the [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuards]], Kreel taught Skywalker how to fight. He spoke with Grakkus and watched as the MagnaGuards fought Skywalker. Later, he was shown the beast that Skywalker would face.<ref name=\"SW10\" /> Kreel then took Skywalker to the arena to fight [[Kongo|Kongo the Disemboweler]]. Kreel soon contacted a group of [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter]]s, informing them that Skywalker was there.<ref name=\"SW11\" />\n\n[[File:Kreel_takes_down_Grakkus.jpg|thumb|right|231px|Kreel taking down Grakkus]]\nKreel triggered Kongo's [[shock collar]] and then took out Grakkus's MagnaGuards using [[Kreel's lightsaber|a]] [[lightsaber]]. He then arrested Grakkus, telling him that his arena was closed. He was joined by several of the [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE pilots]] who surrounded Skywalker. However, as they were taking Grakkus and Skywalker, Grakkus initiated an [[Electromagnetic pulse|E.M.P.]] that disabled Kreel's and the TIE [[pilot]]s' guns. Kreel then drew his lightsaber as Kongo was revived. Kreel attempted to subdue Skywalker but was attacked by Grakkus. He ordered the pilots and stormtroopers to capture Skywalker and his allies. Afterward, Kreel spoke with Vader about Skywalker as he showed the [[Sith]] [[Lord]] Grakkus' collection of [[Jedi]] artifacts.<ref name=\"SW12\" />\n\n===Task Force 99===\n[[File:SW19_Kreel_squad.png|thumb|left|203px|Kreel leading the elite stormtrooper group known as Task Force 99]]\nNot long after Nar Shaddaa, Kreel was given command of a SCAR trooper squad, Task Force 99.<ref name=\"SW21\" /> Kreel and the squad went to [[Sunspot Prison]] to find [[Kolar Ludd]]. Kreel and his squad were given a new assignment,<ref name=\"SW19\">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref> on the [[Ghost Moon]]. There, they were able to shoot down the Rebels' [[Taylander shuttle]]. He and his squad then attacked the rebel forces, with Kreel destroying a [[Tank (vehicle)|tank]] with his lightsaber. The attack was successful, with Kreel and his squad capturing [[Admiral]] [[Verette]], and interrogating him.<ref name=\"SW21\" />\n\nKreel then had Verette tied to his shuttle and sent it to the [[Hijacking of the Harbinger|captured]] [[Star Destroyer]] [[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|''Harbinger'']] as distraction, while he and his SCAR troopers boarded the ''Harbinger'' to retake it.<ref name=\"SW23\">[[Star Wars (2015) 23|''Star Wars'' (2015) 23]]</ref> Kreel then fought and [[Lightsaber duel|dueled]] Skywalker, confirming to Luke that he was the Gamemaster from Grakkus's arena.<ref name=\"SW24\">[[Star Wars (2015) 24|''Star Wars'' (2015) 24]]</ref> During the fighting, Kreel was contacted by Vader and was warned not to injure Skywalker&mdash;a contact that allowed Skywalker to sense Vader's presence, leaving him distracted. Kreel took advantage of Luke's attempt to use [[the Force]], which he claimed to just get in the way of true fighting skill&mdash;but before he could fully overpower the young Jedi, Luke struck out with a [[Force push]] that rocked the entire Star Destroyer, trapping Kreel under wreckage and debris. While Luke and the others escaped, Kreel ordered his team to salvage the mission by destroying the Star Destroyer, while he used his lightsaber to cut off his own arm at the shoulder, allowing him to rejoin them as they escaped the ship. While Vader was furious that Kreel and his SCAR team had thoroughly failed in every one of their objectives, Kreel and the Task Force escaped the brunt of his wrath by presenting a valuable captive: the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]].<ref name=\"SW25\">[[Star Wars (2015) 25|''Star Wars'' (2015) 25]]</ref>\n\nKreel and SCAR Squadron took 3PO to the ''[[Devastator]]'', where they attempted to interrogate him in order to find the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Rebel fleet]] or any new bases. However, Kreel was ordered to get rid of 3PO by Vader. Despite Vader's orders, Kreel decided to use 3PO as bait to lure the Rebels to them.<ref name=\"SW26\">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref>\n\nKreel was later practicing his lightsaber skills when Vader came in and explained his disappointment about what happened on the ''Harbinger''. However, Kreel convinced Vader to let him and his squad live. Vader then ordered the squad to go to the [[Horox system]] to eliminate a rebel base. Before leaving, the Emperor came, and Kreel knelt in honor. The Emperor told him to carry on and that the Empire needed more soldiers like him. He and his squad went to the Horox system, where they found villagers being ruled by a tyrant, whom they killed, gaining the respect of the villagers. They convinced them to give them the coordinates of the rebel base. On Horox III they found a rebel base and destroyed it.<ref name=\"Star Wars 37\">[[Star Wars (2015) 37|''Star Wars'' (2015) 37]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Luke_vs_Kreel_on_Crait.png|thumb|right|193px|Kreel vs. Skywalker on Crait]]\nKreel and SCAR Squad later [[Mission to Crait|confronted]] the rebels again on the [[planet]] [[Crait]], where the Rebels were attempting to build a [[Crait outpost|new base]]. SCAR Squad engaged the rebel forces on the planet but were defeated.
