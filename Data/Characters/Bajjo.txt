Around [[40 BBY]], the Opposition protested the signing of the [[Governance Treaty]] due to its support of the [[Czerka Arms|Czerka Corporation]] and was framed for violent attacks on Czerka facilities as a result. While in [[Opposition hideout|hiding]] on Pijal's [[moon]], Azucca informed the [[Jedi]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] of the troupe's framing, and an [[Unidentified Opposition member|Opposition member]] corroborated her claim by citing Bajjo and other members' artistic pasts as proof of their innocence.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Political art. Acts that might uplift the spirit while they informed the public. We staged shows in public places, played pranks, did whatever we could do to get attention. But we never, ever hurt anyone.

For some [[time]], the group hosted theatrical performances on Pijal that showcased its opinions on local issues while also being informative to the public. During these exhibitions, Bajjo focused her [[eye]]-[[Glass|lenses]] to create abstract [[hologram]]s.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> By around [[40 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">{{MasterApprenticedate}}</ref> the Opposition began to protest the [[Governance Treaty]], believing that the motion would cede irrevocable power to the [[Czerka Arms|Czerka Corporation]], which had been exploiting the resources of Pijal and its [[moon]] for [[Standard century|centuries]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nShortly after voicing its dissent to the treaty, the troupe was framed by the [[Pijali monarchy]] for several violent attacks on Czerka facilities, which forced the group into [[Opposition hideout|hiding]] on Pijal's moon. When [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], visited Pijal's moon, they were attacked by a secret division of Pijali [[Royal guard (Pijal)|royal guards]] called [[blackguard]]s. Opposition members rescued them, and Azucca explained to the [[Jedi]] that their troupe had been framed for the recent attacks. An [[Unidentified Opposition member|Opposition member]] corroborated Azucca's claim by citing Bajjo's and other members' innocuous pasts as proof of their innocence.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAs a performing artist in the Opposition, Bajjo enjoyed participating in her troupe's exhibitions to express political opinions. She protested the signing of the Governance Treaty but was unwilling to resort to violence in the process. One of Bajjo's colleagues described her past occupation as an artist to be innocuous.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBajjo was mentioned in ''[[Master & Apprentice]]'', a [[2019]] novel by [[Claudia Gray]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Master & Apprentice]]'' {{1stm|[[Master & Apprentice (audiobook)|''Master & Apprentice'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Master & Apprentice (audiobook)|''Master & Apprentice'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Opposition members]]\n[[Category:Performing artists]]\n[[Category:Pijali]]"}}}]}}}}
