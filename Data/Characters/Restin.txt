Following [[the Disaster]] and the [[Battle of Yavin]], Restin vowed revenge against the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] for the loss of his family on [[Alderaan]]. To carry out his vengeance, Restin, his droids and his assistant, [[Cranwell]] created a genetic [[Gamorrean Serum|serum]] that could be a activated by a specific soundwave.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader's Castle\" />\n\nRestin was visited by Lord Vader after he was informed about Restin's plans from Cranwell. Upon Vader's arrival, Restin demonstrated the serum's effect on Cranwell. After Cranwell's transformation into a [[Gamorrean]], Restin revealed his treachery by allowing Cranwell to attack Vader and his stormtroopers. Despite the loss of his stormtroopers, Vader was able to [[force choke]] Restin and force him to confess to his treason. Despite his confession, Restin was not spared from Vader's wrath. Instead, Restin was left at the mercy of Cranwell and the stormtroopers. He was transformed into a Gamorrean and was attacked by his fellow Gamorreans as Vader left them to their fate.<ref name=\"Shadow of Vader's Castle\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars Adventures: Shadow of Vader's Castle]]'' {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Tarkin Initiative personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
