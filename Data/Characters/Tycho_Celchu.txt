He willingly chose to subject himself to a surrendering of his basic freedoms in order to bring the Empire down. Because of suspicions about what the Empire might have done to him, it was felt he could not be trusted, yet this man refused to let those suspicions prevent him from doing all he could to destroy the Empire. [&hellip;] Let there be no citizen of the New Republic who harbors suspicions about Tycho Celchu. His devotion to the New Republic is unquestioned.|Mon Mothma, in a public ceremony|X-Wing: The Krytos Trap}}\n'''Tycho Celchu''' {{Pronounced|'ta\u026ako 's\u025blt\u0283u}} was a renowned starfighter pilot for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], serving as [[Rogue Leader/Legends|Rogue Leader]] for approximately a decade, before becoming a general in the [[Galactic Alliance Defense Force]]. A native of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], he joined the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] as a [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]]. He was speaking with his family by [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] when [[Destruction of Alderaan|Alderaan was destroyed]] by the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]], an event which pushed him into defecting to the Rebel Alliance. Celchu quickly became an [[Ace/Legends|ace]] pilot with the elite [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. There he fought alongside [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], who became his lifelong best friend.\n\nCelchu flew in the Battles of [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] and [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Endor]], as well as in several campaigns for the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] during which he became the second-in-command of Rogue Squadron and began a romantic relationship with the intelligence agent [[Winter Celchu|Winter]]. In [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]], during a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] mission to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], he was captured by [[Ysanne Isard]] and imprisoned in the dreaded [[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]] [[Prison/Legends|prison]]. She attempted to brainwash him, but he resisted and was eventually able to escape. He fell under a cloud of suspicion due to his time there, with many fearing he had been turned into a double agent. He later helped Antilles rebuild Rogue Squadron and aided in the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|Liberation of Coruscant]]. Events came to a head when he was accused of murdering fellow Rogue [[Corran Horn]] and was put on [[Trial of Tycho Celchu|trial]] for [[Treason/Legends|treason]]. Celchu's name was completely cleared when Horn, having been only captured and not killed, escaped from Lusankya with evidence that proved Celchu had never succumbed to Isard.\n\nCelchu helped bring down Isard in the [[Bacta War]], then led Rogue Squadron while Antilles formed [[Wraith Squadron]]. He fought in the [[Thrawn campaign]] and helped defeat [[Prince-Admiral/Legends|Prince-Admiral]] [[Delak Krennel]] before he was handed permanent command of Rogue Squadron when Antilles moved on. He married Winter in [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], and retired in [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]] when peace was reached with the Empire. Celchu returned to service during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], during which he was promoted to [[General/Legends|general]]. Following the victory, Celchu became a training officer, teaching Antilles's daughter [[Syal Antilles|Syal]]. When the [[Second Galactic Civil War]] broke out in [[40 ABY]], Celchu was serving as an analyst for [[Supreme Commander (Alliance/Republic)|Supreme Commander]] [[Cha Niathal]] and he found himself on opposite sides from Antilles. He was able to transfer Syal to a position liaising with the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], who had begun opposing the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]], but put himself in danger opposing a Jedi attempt against [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] out of his sense of duty, though he did not support Solo himself. When Niathal split with Solo, Celchu supported her, and after Solo was defeated he retired for the second time.\n\n==Biography==\n===In the Empire's service===\n{{Quote|Just remember this, Celchu: you no longer belong to Alderaan.

Celchu and Skywalker set out on [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bikes]] for Red Squadron's landing site, evading [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE Bomber]] attacks along the way and escaping into [[Realspace/Legends|space]]. Celchu immediately volunteered his knowledge about an upcoming attempt by the storm commandos to kidnap a group of scientists from [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]] who had developed an especially powerful [[Planetary shield/Legends|planetary shield]].

They set up a temporary base on nearby [[Kile]] and reconnoitered the area before Skywalker and his allies arrived and decided that Skywalker and the Rogues would draw off the 144-TIE complement on Gall, allowing [[Dash Rendar/Legends|Dash Rendar]] to lead [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] to Fett's docked [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']].

They engaged in a grueling dogfight until General Han Solo was able to destroy the shield generator on Endor. Calrissian, leading the fighter force, and Antilles both headed for the Death Star, racing down a constricting access shaft.<ref name=\"Return of the Jedi\" /> Celchu flew as Antilles's wing, guiding his fighter through the maze of half-finished girders and access shafts of the massive superweapon.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" /> He split off from the attack force in order to lead several TIEs away through the Death Star and reduce the pursuit on Antilles and Calrissian, who successfully destroyed the Death Star; both Palpatine and Darth Vader died aboard it due to the actions of Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /><ref name=\"Return of the Jedi\" /> Celchu survived his decoy run and was awarded the Endor battle patch signifying participation in the Death Star run.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nCelchu had hoped that the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|victory]] would force the Empire to surrender, but it was not to be so.<ref name=\"Rogue Leader\" /> Shortly after the battle, the Rebel forces received a message intended for Palpatine informing him that the planet [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]] was under attack by invading aliens. Rogue Squadron was sent to Bakura to aid the Imperial world and possibly recruit it as part of a task force under Skywalker and Solo. When they arrived, they found the aliens engaged in a fierce battle with the Bakuran Imperial forces. Celchu and the Rogues pressed the attack, driving the invaders off. Skywalker, Solo, and Leia Organa were able to negotiate a truce with the Imperials and learned that the attackers were [[Ssi-ruu]]k from the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Eventually, the Ssi-ruuk attacked once more and Celchu flew against them, but during the battle the Imperial forces turned on the Rebels, destroying their flagship [[Quasar Fire-class bulk cruiser|carrier]] ''[[Flurry]]''. An uprising on Bakura removed Imperial governor [[Wilek Nereus]] from power, however, allowing Commander [[Pter Thanas]] to surrender the Imperial forces to the Rebels once the Ssi-ruuk were defeated.<ref name=\"The Truce at Bakura\">''[[The Truce at Bakura]]''</ref> During his time on Bakura, Celchu spent time with Princess Leia Organa, the last remaining member of the [[House of Organa/Legends|royal house]] of his homeworld and a leading member of the Rebellion, a woman he had earlier befriended during his time in the Rogues.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho_Endor.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Tycho Celchu on Endor, after being attacked by a Gorax]]\nWhen the task force returned to Endor one week after their victory there, Celchu, like the rest of the Rogues, took on duties cleaning up the post-battle debris. He and veteran Rogue Wes Janson were sent to investigate [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] reports of a surviving Imperial patrol far out in the forest, where they were attacked by a [[Gorax/Legends|Gorax]] that had killed the patrol. Celchu distracted the massive beast while Janson sniped it, killing the creature. With the question of the patrol answered, the pair were sent to rendezvous with Antilles and Skywalker. The four, along with pilot [[Ten Numb/Legends|Ten Numb]], were assigned to scout the [[Corellian system]] in order to gather information about the system's state in the wake of the victory at Endor.<ref name=\"Rogue Leader\" />\n\nThey infiltrated the system and searched it for evidence of Imperial activity, but found none. They returned to [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet]], the capital of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], one week after they were first assigned. While relaxing in a cantina, they fell afoul of a raid by Imperial General [[Weir/Legends|Weir's]] [[storm commando]]s. Weir had set himself up as the master of the system and launched a surprise assault on Coronet. Celchu and the other Rogues fought back, but Weir withdrew quickly; he had only wanted to make a show of Imperial power. Numb trailed Weir's forces, followed by Skywalker, Antilles, and Janson. Celchu made his way back to the hangar and readied their fighters. He could not bring Numb's [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter/Legends|B-wing]], which had no astromech to pilot it, but he set off in his A-wing with the others' X-wings following. He met up with the others just after Numb had been captured by Weir. They followed Numb's homing beacon away from Corellia, but were attacked by TIEs in orbit, which turned out to be suicide drones. Celchu and Antilles eliminated several before they could attack civilian traffic, but during the battle they lost Numb's signal.<ref name=\"Rogue Leader\" />\n\n[[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] extrapolated Weir's likely destination as being [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]], where the Rogues found locals who pointed out a tunnel network used by stormtroopers. The four men infiltrated the base but were detected; however, Weir had sufficient fear of Skywalker's Jedi abilities to order an evacuation. While Skywalker and Janson searched for Numb, Antilles and Celchu stole a pair of TIE Fighters and set off after Weir in his TIE Interceptor. Pursued by more fighters in the narrow launch tunnel, both Rebels managed to avoid taking fire. As they emerged, Antilles shot down Weir and put down to capture him while Celchu, now in the open, shot down the remaining enemy fighters. Weir was imprisoned, but Numb had died in captivity.<ref name=\"Rogue Leader\" />\n\n===Second-in-command===\n{{Quote|Wait, slow down.

On Cilpar, they could not find their contact and set up a base to wait. After two weeks of waiting, they were [[Mission to Cilpar|attacked]] by Imperial fighters; Janson was shot down. Celchu landed to see to him while the other Rogues headed back to base. He pulled Janson, injured, from his burning starfighter before it exploded and the pair made their way to a cave for shelter. Once they were settled and he had given Janson medical attention, Celchu contacted Antilles at their hidden base on Cilpar and arranged to be extracted in the morning. Overnight, he and Janson were surprised by a woman who appeared to be Leia Organa wielding a pistol; she identified herself as [[Winter Celchu|Winter]], their contact. The New Republic had expected the local [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], [[Boren Tascl]], to defect, but after Endor he turned on them. Winter wanted to know why, and sent Celchu undercover to the Imperial base in a captain's uniform.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nPosing as a newly assigned officer who had been forced to set down outside the city, Celchu gained admittance to the base, where he claimed he had been sent after his convoy was ambushed. He got into a minor scuffle with a pilot named [[Petro (pilot)|Petro]], who insulted his Alderaanian heritage, but an alert came almost immediately for the base's TIE squadron to attack the local resistance fighters. Celchu was assigned to a TIE Fighter and ordered to accompany the attack. He contacted his X-wing's astromech, ordering it to buzz Antilles, who was with [[Elscol Loro]] and the Cilpari resistance at a weapons depot. It then tailed him; he intended to use its pursuit as an excuse to drop out of combat, but squadron leader [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Grode]] insisted on engaging the X-wing himself. To Celchu's great surprise, the fighter destroyed two TIEs, including Grode's, before engaging Celchu and shooting him down; Celchu ejected. He cut his way through the jungle, eventually meeting an Imperial convoy. He was taken aboard one personnel carrier, where Winter, thought to be Organa, was held prisoner. She was ordered to give him medical attention and they spoke furtively; Winter informed him that she had been in his fighter when it took off and had been piloting it throughout the battle. He made it back to base, where he was the senior flight officer due to Grode's death. When the Rogues and Loro's resistance attacked, Celchu was ordered to strafe their ground column. Once in the sky, he turned on the Imperials, aiding the Rogues in destroying the Imperial air cover while Loro captured the local Imperial leadership and freed Winter. Celchu was assigned to pilot the Moff's shuttle to headquarters; Winter volunteered to be his copilot. Celchu found himself interested in the woman and eagerly accepted her offer. Loro was recruited into the squadron and piloted Celchu's fighter back.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" />\n\nEventually, the Rogues finally escorted a convoy to Mrlsst. They came under attack over the world by an [[Interdictor-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Interdictor-class Star Destroyer]] and its TIE complement. The Rogues forced the Interdictor to withdraw before guiding the convoy down. While Antilles spoke with the leaders of the [[Mrlsst Trade and Science Academy]] about the New Republic's efforts to acquire the [[Phantom Project]] cloaking device, Celchu oversaw the unloading of the cargo. Once their duties were over, Antilles ran into his old friend [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Terrik]] and visited while Celchu set off to [[The Soundmound]] for entertainment with Klivian, [[Isplourrdacartha Estillo|Plourr Ilo]], and [[Dllr Nep]]. On the way, they came across a speech being given by the [[Ante-Endor Association]], a group which denied that the Battle of Endor had occurred. Celchu was aghast at their propaganda, and while the others did not want to bother with the group and continued on, Celchu insisted on confronting the AEA speakers. They shrugged off his arguments, leaving him in a foul mood. As he headed to the Soundmound that evening, the AEA members waylaid him. When he continued to insist that the Battle of Endor had occurred, they began beating him. Celchu was able to turn the tables on them, defeating all members of the group but one, who struck him from behind. He was saved by the arrival of a Jedi who struck the final attacker and then disappeared, leaving Celchu astounded.

During the meeting, AEA members, acting as auxiliaries for Hask, broke in and stole the datacards containing details of the project, but a doctored holocam transmission showed Celchu as one of the intruders. Celchu was actually visiting Janson, who was healing his broken leg, in the hospital with the rest of the Rogues. They were warned that stormtroopers were coming to arrest them on behalf of the [[Mrlssi]] just before the Imperial troops arrived. They took Janson and fought their way out of the hospital, escaping into the outcast community atop the local vegetation. A computer expert there was able to slice into the records and determine that the datacards had been taken from the AEA members by droids used by [[Professor/Legends|Professor]] [[Rorax Falken]]'s students. Celchu ordered the others to retrieve the datacards while he, Klivian, and Ilo freed the arrested Antilles. As the arrived, they found Antilles leaving, broken out by the same Ghost Jedi that had saved Celchu. Antilles revealed that the Phantom Ship project had been a fake all along, designed to draw Imperial spending; the New Republic had simply been playing along. When Falken faked the destruction of his asteroid laboratory, Hask launched TIE Bombers against Mrlsst, which Celchu and the Rogues shot down. Hask was killed and his Interdictor destroyed by the activation of an actual superweapon, a [[Gravitic polarization beam]].<ref name=\"The Phantom Affair\" />\n\n===A budding romance===\n{{Dialogue|Celchu|Maybe you'd feel better if one of us stayed here&hellip;as a ''bodyguard''&hellip;|Winter|No need.

They were to meet with a female contact; Celchu was convinced that it would be Winter, with whom he was smitten. The meeting was at [[Huff Darklighter]]'s estate during a reception honoring Biggs Darklighter; Celchu, Antilles, and Loro would attend. Celchu waited to meet the contact in the lobby and, after an initial mishap involving the [[Whiphid/Legends|Whiphid]] [[Betsi]], Celchu discovered that his date for the evening was in fact Winter, much to his delight. They spoke briefly, with Celchu flirting with her but eliciting little response. Raiders attacked the party shortly thereafter, but Winter explained that they were a diversion for her. She and Celchu used the distraction to go after a datadisk of Darklighter's, but found that another group of thieves had already beaten them there; the diversion had not in fact been Winter's. A pair of [[Rodian/Legends|Rodians]] escaped with the disks, pursued by Antilles and Loro in a speeder; Celchu and Winter borrowed a speeder and blasters from Darklighter and set out in pursuit as well. A group of thugs ambushed Antilles and Loro, destroying their speeder, but Celchu and Winter engaged them. Their speeder was also shot down, with the pair barely escaping the wreck.<ref name=\"Battleground: Tatooine\" />\n\nCelchu, Antilles, and Winter returned to the estate and confronted Darklighter, who admitted that the disk contained information about a weapons cache including the experimental cruiser [[Eidolon (Strike-class)|''Eidolon'']] and gave them a copy he had made of the disk. The next day, they requested the use of Darklighter's weather satellite, using it to track the movements of [[Firith Olan]], the crime boss who had stolen the disc. They found Olan at another cache he had discovered. Several TIEs were launched from it, which the Rogues engaged. Meanwhile, Olan escaped to orbit, where the Rogues pursued him. An Imperial capital ship appeared in orbit and released a squadron of TIE fighters. When the fighters engaged Olan's defenses, Antilles decided to leave the field of battle while the Rogues were ahead and the group returned to base.<ref name=\"Battleground: Tatooine\" />\n\nOlan escaped the destroyer, [[Harrow/Legends|''Harrow'']], and Antilles, Celchu, Winter, and Loro followed him to [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]], where they knew the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] crimelord would seek shelter. Olan was in fact denied shelter, and a contest was held between the Rogues and the Imperial contingent from the ''Harrow'' for Olan, which the Imperials won. The troopers selected for the competition were left behind by their captain, who had spirited Olan away on his own. The troopers, led by [[Sixtus Quin]], felt betrayed and joined forces with the Rogues. They returned to Tatooine, where they joined with the rest of the Rogues to track down Olan and [[Marl Semtin]], the ''Harrow''{{'s}} captain. The Rogues found the Eidolon base, holographically camouflaged into a hillside. Celchu's investigative pass caused the base to launch multiple TIE Interceptors, which were able to cripple Celchu's X-wing. Celchu chose to pilot his X-wing into a formation of TIEs, ejecting shortly before his fighter destroyed the enemy ships. He announced this using the code phrase \"going out with a bang.\" Winter, listening, was not familiar with the term and so believed he had died in the crash, driving her to grief and forcing her to acknowledge her feelings for him. After Semtin was killed, Olan presumed killed, and the base secured, the New Republic forces retrieved Celchu, whom Winter greeted with a passionate kiss.<ref name=\"Battleground: Tatooine\" />\n\n===Intrigues===\n{{Quote|Ah, but have you considered&hellip;directing the outcome to your own advantage?

They frequently ran combat simulations against each other to improve unit cohesion. After one session seven months after Endor, Celchu and Antilles were called in to meet with [[Grand Duke]] [[Gror Pernon]] of [[Eiattu 6|Eiattu]], who informed them that Eiattu was torn by civil war, with [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Harrandatha Estillo]] leading a rebellion against the [[Priamsta]] nobles after being thought dead. He further informed them that Rogue pilot Plourr Ilo was actually Isplourrdacartha Estillo, princess of Eiattu. The Rogues were ordered to escort her back to her world, where it was hoped she could bring about peace. They proceeded to Eiattu, where they were hosted at a diplomatic reception for Estillo. Antilles and Celchu were later taken out to tour sites of attacks by the [[People's Liberation Battalion]], Harrandatha Estillo's rebel group. During the tour, they were contacted by the other Rogues, who had gone on a [[thuvasaur]]-hunting expedition and stumbled across an Imperial patrol. They returned to their fighters and, with Estillo and her fianc\u00e9e [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Rial Pernon]], destroyed the Imperial air support while an attack on the Imperials from the People's Liberation Battalion saved the Rogues on the ground.<ref name=\"The Warrior Princess\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Warrior Princess]]''</ref>\n\nCelchu and Antilles later met with Count [[Arian Laabann]], the leader of the Priamsta, who suggested that the New Republic ally with him to overthrow Estillo and place the Priamsta in power; Estillo had made it clear that she would not support a return of the nobility to absolute power. Celchu was outraged, and Antilles refused. They went to inform Estillo, and found her and Pernon after having just barely survived a kidnap attempt by Priamsta forces. Pernon suggested Estillo ally herself with the PLB, but she revealed that their leader was not her brother&mdash;she had killed him, a brainwashed Imperial agent, during her escape from the massacre of the royal family. The leader of the PLB was [[Harrandatha Estillo (impostor)|an impostor]]. As they spoke, however, the PLB began an attack on the Imperial fortress on Eiattu. Celchu, Antilles, and Estillo flew against the Imperial forces, having realized that the false Harrandatha Estillo was in league with Moff [[Leonia Tavira]] to loot the world and flee. Once the Imperials were defeated, Estillo confronted the impostor and exposed him, restoring peace, though Tavira escaped.<ref name=\"The Warrior Princess\" />\n\n[[File:Celchuunderattack.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Celchu defends the camp against an Irrukiine attack.]]\nThe Rogues left Eiattu to track down the ''[[Starfaring]]'', a ship which had gone missing. They tracked it to the [[Malrev system]], where they were attacked by TIE Fighters while investigating the [[Malrev IV|fourth planet]] of the system. Antilles was shot down before the TIEs were eliminated, distressing Celchu. They could not land in the dense forest to recover him, and so put down in a clearing with the ''Starfaring'' two kilometers away, where they enjoyed the hospitality of the ship's Bothan crew. That night, Celchu was awoken by a nightmare to discover the camp under attack by the native [[Irrukiine]]. He joined the defense, and only [[Nrin Vakil]]'s use of his starfighter against the Irrukiine prevented them from overrunning the camp. Celchu organized a tighter defense in the wake of the attack, taking first watch.<ref name=\"Requiem for a Rogue\" />\n\nThe next morning, Celchu led the Rogues and several of the Bothans on an expedition to find Antilles, hoping the Irrukiine had not killed him. During their march, Rogue [[Herian I'ngre]] informed Celchu that the ''Starfaring''{{'s}} hyperdrive had not failed, but had instead been sabotaged; the Bothans were up to more than they admitted. Celchu warned the pilots to be alert for possible betrayal. They made their way to the temple where the Irrukiine were based and fell victim to an Irrukiine ambush. During the battle, Antilles escaped from the temple, where he had been held captive by [[Cartariun]], the [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] former Imperial technician who was harnessing the temple's [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] energies to control the Irrukiine. They retreated from the ambush, but I'ngre was wounded and Dllr Nep left behind. Antilles, Celchu, and Janson went for a supposed scouting mission in their fighters, using the opportunity to get away from the Bothans. Celchu shared his belief that [[Girov Dza'tey]], the Bothan leader, was an undercover agent and had deliberately landed and killed the ship's captain in order to seek out the temple's power. Cartariun launched a TIE assault at that time, forcing the three to hold off a massive wave of TIEs piloted by the unskilled Irrukiine until the other Rogues arrived. Nep, captive in the temple, was able to overpower Cartariun, breaking his concentration and causing the Irrukiine attack to fall apart.<ref name=\"Requiem for a Rogue\" />\n\nWhen they returned to the camp, they realized that Dza'tey had left the camp, and through the mental link Nep established with I'ngre through the Sith magic, learned that Dza'tey had killed Cartariun, taken control of the temple's power, and was preparing an attack against the Rogues. Antilles, backed by Celchu, tested the Bothan second-in-command's loyalty and found that he would accompany them in an attack against Dza'tey. The battle itself was fierce, with the Irrukiine using Dza'tey's knowledge of tactics; the arrival of Estillo with a squadron of her own fighters provided crucial aid. Nep, however, guided I'ngre from her sickbed, into a fighter, and in an attack against the temple. When her proton torpedoes did not damage it sufficiently, they decided to give their lives eliminating it, with I'ngre guiding her fighter into the temple and destroying it.<ref name=\"Requiem for a Rogue\" />\n\n===The battle for Brentaal IV===\n{{Quote|He is one of their best. I will kill him.|Turr Phennir, to Soontir Fel, speaking of Tycho Celchu|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: In the Empire's Service}}\nOne month later, the Rogues were assigned to scout [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] as the New Republic continued pressing toward the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]]. They were attacked by TIEs from the world's defensive moonbase, but Celchu shot several of them down and the Rogues escaped with enough data on the world. They returned to their base, where Celchu and Antilles looked over the replacement pilots transferring into the squadron. Admiral [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Ackbar]] personally assigned the squadron to work with Colonel [[Horton Salm/Legends|Horton Salm's]] [[Aggressor Wing]] to take Brentaal IV, for which they trained for two weeks. When the time came for the assault, the Rogues attacked Brentaal's moonbase, eliminating its fighter screen and allowing New Republic troops to take control of the base. Post-battle analysis showed that the TIE Interceptors they had faced were part of the [[181st Imperial Fighter Wing/Legends|181st Imperial Fighter Group]], an elite group led by his former instructor Fel, currently known as the Empire's best ace. When the rest of the 181st showed up to defend Brentaal, Celchu and Klivian helped explain his history and reputation to some of the newer or cockier pilots.<ref name=\"In the Empire's Service\" />\n\n[[File:Celchu-vs-Phennir.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Celchu dogfights with Major Turr Phennir.]]\nWhen the time came to attack Brentaal IV itself, the Rogues attacked the capital, [[Vuultin]], while Aggressor Wing led the capture of [[Oradin]], the more strategically valuable spaceport. Celchu led Three Flight against the elements of the 181st stationed in Vuultin, but the Rogues were called away once they succeeded in drawing Fel from Oradin to protect [[Lon Isoto]], the admiral commanding Brentaal IV's defense. The Rogues moved their base to Oradin, and when a convoy arrived to evacuate the Imperial loyalist citizens, the Rogues were scrambled to ground the evacuation yachts and keep the citizens from escaping with Brentaal IV's wealth. As the battle moved to space, Celchu engaged [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Turr Phennir]], Fel's executive officer. Celchu was able to get the drop on Phennir, but the other pilot broke off. Meanwhile, Antilles engaged Fel, driving him into the field of fire of Salm's [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]].<ref name=\"In the Empire's Service\" /> Fel was captured and, following his interrogation by the New Republic, decided to defect, disillusioned with the Empire.<ref name=\"In the Empire's Service\" /><ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" />\n\nHe joined Rogue Squadron as a pilot, and Celchu was present when Antilles introduced Fel to the squadron, provoking some dissent among its members; Celchu, a former Imperial himself, was not bothered by his former mentor's presence within the squadron. Celchu was also present when Antilles announced to Celchu, Klivian, Janson, and Estillo that Fel's wife, Imperial actress Wynssa Starflare, was actually [[Syal Antilles Fel]], Antilles's sister. Antilles assigned Klivian, Janson, and Estillo to go to Corellia and try to rescue her from Imperial retribution, but she had already fled; they were able to bring back some of Fel's family, however.<ref name=\"Family Ties\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties]]''</ref>\n\n===Wooing Winter===\n{{Quote|You Rogues have a rep for doing the impossible, but getting us out of here has to tax even your skills.''\"<br />\"''It's not the difficulty of the task, m'lady, but the degree of motivation.

Believe it.|Winter and Tycho Celchu|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Masquerade}}\nThe Rogues spent the next month training, with Fel becoming acclimated to the X-wing. On one training run at the end of that month, the Rogues came across a cruiser being attacked by pirates and moved to engage them. Celchu led Three Flight, which was short a pilot, in providing fighter cover, as the Rogues drove the pirates away. After returning to base, Celchu and Fel were assigned to escort Leia Organa and attend a diplomatic meeting on Eiattu. They were to be flown there aboard the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. While Fel and Solo, former classmates at the [[Academy of Carida]], caught up in the cockpit, Organa requested Celchu stay behind and speak with her. Celchu brought up Winter and his admiration for her, and Organa mentioned that her aide had perhaps taken an interest in Celchu as well.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" />\n\nWhen they arrived, a reception was held, but during it Solo sent Celchu up to speak with Organa, who had requested his presence in her room. Celchu entered and was surprised to find Organa in a small, form-fitting dress. When she kissed him, the shocked pilot realized that the woman seducing him was Winter, serving as Organa's double as she sometimes did. As they kissed, however, they were ambushed by masked attackers. Celchu threw himself in front of the stun blast meant for Winter, but the attackers stunned her as well, thinking she was Organa, and carried both away. The captors were pirates working for Tavira, Eiattu's former Moff, who had allied herself with the pirate chief [[Kavil]]. They beat Celchu in retaliation for his role in deposing Tavira before bringing both the captives before her, where the former Moff informed them that she intended to barter with the New Republic, offering their freedom in exchange for New Republic support of her warlordism.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho-Masquerade.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Celchu and Winter share a moment after the battle.]]\nThey were returned to their cells, where Winter apologized for getting Celchu into the situation by requesting him as her escort, but Celchu refused to allow her to blame herself. While Winter fell asleep, Celchu recognized that the latches on the cells were scavenged from TIE fighters; as an old TIE pilot, he knew the tricks of opening them and was able to use his belt buckle to force the lock open, freeing Winter and overcoming the guard. They were able to sneak to the hangar, where they overpowered another pair of guards and commandeered a Y-wing. Pursued by [[TYE-wing]] [[Ugly/Legends|Uglies]], Celchu piloted the ship through [[Axxila/Legends|Axxila]], where Tavira had brought them, while Winter manned the gunner's position. Celchu's emergency distress call attracted the attention of the Rogues, who were on Axxila protecting Organa as she secretly negotiated with [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]] for [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant's]] surrender. Celchu was pleasantly surprised when they arrived to eliminate the squadrons of fighters dogfighting with him. The ''Millennium Falcon'', with Solo, Fel, and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] aboard, were also present, having tracked the pirates to Axxila.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" />\n\nThey returned to the Rogue base on Axxila, but found that Admiral [[Delak Krennel]] had arrived in orbit in the Star Destroyer [[Reckoning (Imperial II-class)|''Reckoning'']]. Fel, whose defection was not yet fully known, devised a plan to capture a TIE fighter and use its comm unit to issue a high-level [[AT3 Directive]] ordering Krennel to retreat. Celchu piloted his Y-wing against a patrol of TIEs with Fel manning the ion cannon; Fel disabled one and the ''Millennium Falcon'' towed it away with its tractor beam. Fel used its comlink to issue the directive, and Krennel complied. Celchu and Winter shared a ride back aboard the ''Falcon''.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" />\n\n===A vital defection===\n{{Quote|What now, Rogue Lead?''\"<br />\"''We head for the night side and go to ground.''\"<br />\"''I've heard better plans before, Lead.''\"<br />\"''And I've had better in the past, Tycho.

One year after the Battle of Endor, Celchu worked out with Antilles, who mentioned that he had been approached to run for president of the New Republic with Celchu as his running mate; both laughed it off. Celchu insisted that Antilles take more time off and set him up with [[Reina Faleur]], a supply clerk who was interested in Antilles. That afternoon, Celchu and Winter went for a walk in the garden, where they met Fel, who was missing his wife and feeling apart from the squadron; Celchu and Winter were able to convince him to join them in their walk. That evening, Celchu and Winter double-dated with Antilles and Faleur, but were called away in the middle of their dinner to ready themselves for a mission.<ref name=\"Mandatory Retirement\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''</ref>\n\nPestage had fled Coruscant, and the Rogues, along with Aggressor Wing and [[Kapp Dendo]]'s [[Commando Team One]], were tasked to raid [[Ciutric IV]], where he was being held, and rescue him. They were not entirely comfortable with the plan, which could easily be compromised by the presence of Imperial reinforcements, but were prepared to go ahead with it. They were minimally opposed in their assault on the world, but were trapped by the arrival of Krennel's ''Reckoning'' and the Interdictor Star Destroyer ''[[Binder]]''. Aggressor Wing escaped, but the Rogues and commandos had to return to the surface and take cover. Knowing that Krennel would send out patrols, they decided to thin his complement of TIEs by engaging the first patrol they came across. They eliminated it, but Rogue pilot [[Ibtisam]] was killed in the battle.<ref name=\"Mandatory Retirement\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho-funeral.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Celchu, attending Ibtisam's funeral services]]\nThe Rogues then engaged Krennel's TIEs in space, destroying several and covering the arrival of Mirax Terrik, whom Antilles had contacted. With her came Aggressor Wing, which had lain in wait on the edge of the system. After landing once more and gathering their strength, the Rogues returned to the skies a third time, attacking ''Reckoning'' and ''Binder'' with their proton torpedoes while eliminating the last of the TIEs. The capital ships fled, allowing Rogue Squadron to leave; Pestage, however, defected back to the Empire and Dendo had to leave without him.<ref name=\"Mandatory Retirement\" />\n\n===Struggle against Shadowspawn===\n{{Quote|Luke's in danger.''\"<br />\"''What kind of danger?''\"<br />\"''The fatal kind.

Fifteen minutes.|Leia Organa and Wedge Antilles, speaking of Tycho Celchu|Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor}}\n[[File:TychoAtlas.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Celchu during the early days of the Rogues]]\nAs the depredations of the warlord [[Cronal|Shadowspawn]] spread, making pirate attacks on New Republic and civilian vessels, the New Republic found itself frustrated with its inability to find Shadowspawn's base or capture any of his pilots alive. The Rogues became part of a trap masterminded by their superior in [[New Republic Special Operations]], General Calrissian. The Rogues, along with several other units, were secreted inside a mockup of the legendarily extravagant luxury liner ''[[Corellian Queen]]'' and its itinerary leaked. When Shadowspawn's [[TIE/D Defender|TIE Defenders]] struck, the Rogues sprang their ambush. Celchu battled against Shadowspawn's fighters, and the New Republic forces eventually drove them off with the use of [[flechette torpedo]]es, designed to shred TIE Defenders with shrapnel and to adhere tracking devices to those which survived. The trackers revealed that Shadowspawn's base was on [[Mindor/Legends|Mindor]], and the assault against his stronghold was passed on to the newly-promoted General Skywalker's [[Rapid Response Task Force]].<ref name=\"Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor\">''[[Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor]]''</ref>\n\nCelchu, at this point briefly piloting a B-wing, continued to serve with Calrissian. The Rogues assisted him in bringing [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore]] [[Fenn Shysa]] to negotiations with a band of [[Mandalorian Supercommando]]s who, having been in Imperial employ, were holding a system hostage. Almost immediately after arriving, Celchu was approached by Organa, who demanded that he prepare to take her out in his B-wing. She professed an emergency, but Celchu could not violate his orders. When Antilles arrived, Organa admitted that she sensed through the Force that Skywalker was in mortal danger at Mindor. With Antilles's agreement, Celchu immediately rounded up the rest of the Rogues to depart on an unsanctioned rescue mission.<ref name=\"Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor\" />\n\nWhen the Rogues arrived in the [[Taspan system]], cluttered with asteroids and debris from the destruction of [[Taspan II]], they swept to the rescue of Solo and Chewbacca in the ''Millennium Falcon'', who had taken off on a rescue mission of their own. Skywalker's fleet had been devastated, with several of its ships left isolated in orbit, interdicted by a series of hundreds of [[Gravity mine/Legends|gravity mines]]. Skywalker himself had crash-landed the remnants of his flagship [[Justice (MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser)|''Justice'']] on Mindor. Organa transferred from Celchu's starfighter to the ''Millennium Falcon'', for which the Rogues provided cover during a series of microjumps to Mindor, fighting through stiff resistance from swarms of TIE Interceptors along the way. After it landed, the Rogues fought their way back, attempting to clear an escape lane free of gravity mines with the assistance of the Rapid Response Task Force's remaining ships. Meanwhile, the destabilized space debris began moving toward [[Taspan]]. Large amounts of debris plunging into the system's sun would release massive flares of radiation, sterilizing the system in a matter of hours. Celchu and Antilles worked with Captain [[Tirossk]], the senior remaining naval officer, to devise a plan that would allow the gravitic generators of Skywalker's five [[CC-7700/E interdiction cruiser]]s to clear safe lanes through the debris and put it into action. The Rogues were forced to guard the ships against the seemingly endless swarms of TIEs, but were aided by the arrival of Calrissian's flagship, the cruiser [[Remember Alderaan (Star Cruiser)|''Remember Alderaan'']], having followed on a rescue mission of his own after resolving the standoff by hiring the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] himself.<ref name=\"Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor\" />\n\nCelchu and Antilles were summoned to meet with Calrissian, and explained the situation in the system to him&mdash;including the [[gravity bomb]]s being launched from Shadowspawn's surface installation on Mindor. As the escape lanes would not form before Taspan began emitting sufficient radiation to destroy the task force, Calrissian decided to take the task force into the shelter of Mindor's umbra. The Rogues flew cover for the move, and then for the efforts of the [[New Republic marine]]s and Mandalorian Supercommandos who attempted to take control of Shadowspawn's anti-orbital emplacements before the planet rotated sufficiently to allow them to target the fleet. Before the facilities could be secured, however, the entire dormant volcano in which the base was housed launched into space, driven by intense gravitic explosions designed by Shadowspawn to do exactly that. Suddenly, Skywalker issued orders to the Imperial forces in the system to surrender, and ordered the New Republic forces to begin evacuating the slaves from Shadowspawn's base. The Imperial forces, conditioned to obey Skywalker as part of the plan Cronal&mdash;the mastermind behind the Shadowspawn persona&mdash;had devised to transfer his mind to Skywalker's body, immediately complied. Before evacuation operations were complete, Cronal was able to reassert control over his forces, driving them into a murderous frenzy. Celchu was forced to fight off suicidal TIE pilots to protect themselves and the fleet. Skywalker was able to withdraw Cronal's power from the soldiers, leading to the deaths of the entire Imperial complement but opening the opportunity for the New Republic forces to escape Cronal's deathtrap in the Taspan system.<ref name=\"Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor\" />\n\n===Trust destroyed===\n{{Quote|So, you don't even know, really, if you are an Imperial agent waiting to happen or not?''\"<br />\"''I know I'm not.

Winter's assignments kept them from seeing each other much, though Celchu still desired a relationship with her.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> In early to mid [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]], Celchu volunteered to fly a captured TIE fighter into Coruscant on a covert intelligence-gathering [[Scouting mission to Coruscant|mission]]. The fighter had been modified to hold extra sensor equipment, and with the proper codes and Celchu's Imperial experience, it was felt he would be successful. Celchu orbited Coruscant multiple times to pick up data on its orbital defenses before landing. He spent two weeks on Coruscant as the information was shipped out, and was then asked to take the risky move of flying the TIE back out and to a freighter in order to pick up more information. He agreed, but was captured due to ion cannon fire that shorted his fighter's self-destruct.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nCelchu was taken to the legendary [[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]] prison, where [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] and current Imperial ruler [[Ysanne Isard]] broke her captives and brainwashed them into becoming secret agents who would not even remember being in Lusankya before they were activated by Imperial Intelligence and turned against the New Republic.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /> Celchu was kept in the facility for three months during which he was interrogated continually.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /> He was placed in simulators in which he was presented with Imperial craft. Much of his memory suppressed, he initially responded positively, but quickly remembered his hatred of the Empire and attacked them relentlessly. When Isard overlaid the Imperial craft with Alliance data, the contradiction confounded the drugged and disoriented Celchu, and drove him into a catatonic state. Isard realized she could not break him and sent him to live among the general population, where he was one of the catatonic \"[[sleepers]]\" who remembered little and were barely functional.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" />\n\nEventually, he was transferred to a prison on [[Akrit'tar/Legends|Akrit'tar]], where he spent three more months before escaping. Few in the New Republic trusted him, however; due to his time in Lusankya, he was feared to be a double agent, despite the fact that, unlike any other Lusankya victim, he remembered his time there. He spent two months in debriefing but no issues were found with him; though he faced no official sanctions, nearly everyone distrusted him. Antilles was among the few who stood staunchly by Celchu.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\n===Rebuilding the Rogues===\n{{Dialogue|Ackbar|Captain Celchu has agreed to these conditions?|Antilles|He's no different from you, Admiral&mdash;he's a warrior.

Of course, there's no way General Salm will ever let him fly in combat again.|Salm|That can be etched in transparisteel.|Antilles|So serving as an instructor is the only way he can fight back. You have to give him this chance.|attr=Ackbar, Wedge Antilles, and Horton Salm|src=X-Wing: Rogue Squadron}}\nIn [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], Antilles was commissioned to re-form Rogue Squadron. He brought in Celchu to fly against pilot candidates [[Corran Horn]], [[Ooryl Qrygg]], [[Nawara Ven]], and [[Rhysati Ynr]] in a simulation of the [[Redemption scenario|''Redemption'' scenario]], as he was one of the few pilots Antilles thought could bring Horn down and keep him from overconfidence. In the simulation, he eliminated the others before engaging Horn, among the top two pilot prospects, in a head-to-head dogfight that saw him disable Horn before one of Horn's torpedoes caught up with him and destroyed his fighter. Speaking to them after the simulation, he proclaimed himself somewhat rusty but congratulated Horn on eliminating him, leaving the trainees impressed by his skill and wondering about his identity.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nWith the squadron roster nearly finalized, Antilles wished to install Celchu as his executive officer in order to better train his pilots, but his appointment was strenuously resisted by Salm, now promoted to general and Antilles's superior officer, who strongly distrusted Celchu after his time in Lusankya. Celchu knew he would never be allowed to fly in combat as long as he was suspected of being a double agent, but was desperate to serve the cause as an instructor. He agreed with Antilles to fly only a [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]] with training-strength weapons and a remote destruct installed on training exercises, remain under house arrest at all times when not accompanied by his fellow pilots or security personnel, have all his correspondence examined, and undergo interrogation at any time. When Antilles presented the proposal to Ackbar, the admiral called Celchu in, examined him, and was sufficiently impressed by Celchu's willingness to agree to these conditions that he approved the request.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho_Celchu_TCG-JTL.png|thumb|right|250px|Celchu in his flight suit]]\nAs executive officer, Celchu was forced to work closely with \"[[M-3PO (Emtrey)|Emtrey]],\" the unit's [[M-3PO military protocol droid]], who served as quartermaster and administrative aide. He was accompanied by one of two enlisted personnel at all times as well as a female lieutenant with [[Security|Alliance Security]] who had lived on Alderaan and with whom he shared conversation; he was interested in her but remained committed to Winter. Celchu's status was kept hidden from the rest of the squadron, however, as Antilles judged that it would only be a distraction and create the wrong impression. Once the Rogue roster was finalized, they were issued X-wings and began non-simulated exercises. During one exercise, Celchu and Antilles decided to teach Horn a lesson about teamwork, feeding the telemetry from Horn, the first to tackle a training course, to the other squadron members. The data gave them an advantage over Horn, reflected in their scores. Horn, infuriated, spoke with Antilles after the exercise and was rebuked for putting himself ahead of the squadron; after that conversation, Celchu approached the trainee and suggested he be less of a loner and integrate better with the squadron.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nHalfway through the year, the Rogues were made operational and transferred from [[Folor]], where they had been training, to [[Talasea]]. The move was presented to the pilots as an [[Astrogation/Legends|astronavigation]] exercise for security reasons. During the trip, Celchu flew the squadron's [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class support shuttle]], the ''[[Forbidden]]'', under the callsign [[Rogue Null]]; the shuttle had been disarmed in order for Celchu to be allowed to pilot it. On the last leg of the journey, the Rogues were unexpectedly pulled out of hyperspace by an Interdictor that had been set up to trap smuggler activity; coincidentally, Mirax Terrik was in the process of being captured. During the battle, Emtrey, also aboard the shuttle, distracted Celchu with constant chatter; after shouting three times for the droid to shut up, it deactivated and went into a state in which Celchu found he could access all its memories. The Rogues were able to drive off the ship, but as it fled part of its TIE escort passed Horn, who had been disabled by an ion cannon strike. Despite flying a far less maneuverable craft, Celchu maintained a targeting lock on one of the TIE Interceptors nearing Horn's position, feeding Horn his targeting data and allowing the pilot to destroy the TIE with a proton torpedo launch, then doing the same for that TIE's wingmate, bringing a conclusion to the battle.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nThe Rogues based themselves out of Talasea, settling in to the facilities there. Two weeks later, they were assigned to cover the extraction of the frigate [[Battle of Yavin (starship)|''Battle of Yavin'']] from the [[Hensara system]]. Celchu served aboard the [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[Eridain]]'', relaying orders and providing starfighter control. During the extraction, the Rogues successfully beat back an attack by the [[Strike-class medium cruiser|Strike Cruiser]] [[Havoc (Strike-class)|''Havoc'']], once more showing the freshly rebuilt unit's ability in battle. During the post-battle celebration on Talasea, Antilles, Celchu, and Captain [[Afyon]] of the ''Eridain'' were turned to by the pilots to officiate in the matter of declaring a joking punishment for the worst pilot in the unit, a designation given to [[Gavin Darklighter]] due to his lack of kills in the battle. Celchu suggested apprenticing him to the best pilot. Horn had the most kills, however [[Bror Jace]], Horn's rival in the unit, claimed to be the best due to shooting down a higher percentage of the targets he faced. Horn settled the matter by averaging his kills with Darklighter's, showing support for the young man, and thereby elevating Darklighter out of the worst-pilot position and placing Ven, a former lawyer who had been selected to present the case to the senior officers, in the worst pilot position, a situation that caused some amusement.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nThe Imperial forces in the sector were able to detect that their base was on Talasea, and a platoon of stormtroopers raided it in the night, killing pilot [[Lujayne Forge]] and injuring Horn, Darklighter, and [[Andoorni Hui]] before the squadron was awakened and defeated the attackers. The base had to be evacuated. Antilles, Celchu, and Emtrey traveled to [[Home One/Legends|''Home One'']] to meet with Ackbar and Salm and organize a retaliatory strike. The stormtroopers had been traced to [[Vladet]], the site of the sector's Imperial military base. The plan for the hit-and-run attack was decided on, with Celchu serving once more as starfighter coordinator for Rogue Squadron and Salm's [[Defender Wing]], though Salm insisted on having one of his own flight controllers present on the ''Eridain'' as well. The attack itself went well until a [[Lancer-class frigate/Legends|''Lancer''-class frigate]] and [[Carrack-class light cruiser/Legends|''Carrack''-class light cruiser]] arrived unexpectedly, outgunning the New Republic force. Only a dangerous run against the Lancer by Horn destroyed it and allowed the fighters to safely withdraw.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\n===The Battles of Borleias===\n{{Quote|Lieutenant, I want you to understand two things: First, I have the utmost trust and confidence in Captain Celchu. I have no reservations&mdash;''none''&mdash;about him, his service, his skills, or his commitment to the Alliance.|Wedge Antilles, to Corran Horn|X-Wing: Rogue Squadron}}\nRogue Squadron was then transferred to [[Noquivzor]], where they prepared for the attack on a world code-named [[Blackmoon]] which would provide a conduit to Coruscant for the New Republic. During the assault, Celchu once more provided flight control from aboard ''Eridain''. The operation suddenly went sour when, having faked shield loss, the base launched a counterattack during the New Republic landing with fighters and power-generation levels the New Republic had not known it to have. Several Rogues were killed or injured, but the controllers deemed the zone too dangerous for rescue operations. Undeterred, Celchu took the unarmed ''Forbidden'' into the combat zone and recovered Ven, Qrygg, and [[Erisi Dlarit]], who had all gone extravehicular, before the New Republic force evacuated.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nDue to the presence of an evidence-gathering program in his astromech, Horn was able to discover Blackmoon's true name, [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]], and find that an [[Alderaan Biotics]] facility on the planet was being used to provide black-market supplies as well as the power and additional fighters. He went to Antilles and they devised a plan to strike, severing the power conduit between the two facilities so that the military base would not have additional power for its shields. This information was withheld from Celchu, who was deemed a liability; like the rest of the squadron, the attack was presented to him as taking place on a different world. He provided opposition in the simulators while the squadron trained for the mission.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\n[[File:TychoCelchu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Celchu was willing to sacrifice many liberties in order to contribute to the battle against the Empire.]]\nWhen the time for the mission came, Celchu remained behind. In examining Emtrey's supply list, Mirax Terrik, who was on the base at the time, found that he had listed several Alderaanian goods for sale in the near future, a revelation which could be linked to the Alderaan Biotics facility on Borleias and so compromise operational security. Terrik came to Celchu, who summoned Emtrey and demanded that the droid explain. When Emtrey would not divulge the location, Celchu used the voice override to gain access to the unit's memories and discover that the target was Borleias. He locked his security escort in his quarters and set off there with Terrik in her ship, the ''[[Pulsar Skate]]''. Due to the ''Pulsar Skate''{{'s}} speed, they arrived at Borleias before the squadron, but observed nothing unusual and so lurked on the dark side of the moon. The mission itself went off well, but Horn ran low on fuel while dogfighting and had to stay behind on the moon while the others fled. When he engaged the TIE Interceptors searching for him, Celchu manned the freighter's guns and eliminated three of the pursuing fighters, rescuing Horn and giving him a ride back to Noquivzor.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nCelchu was able to avoid serious consequences for evading his security detail, but pilot Bror Jace received the news that his great uncle was dying. Celchu arranged to send him on a \"recruiting mission\" to his homeworld of [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]] in order to let him spend time with his family.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> On his way home, however, he disappeared and X-wing debris was found along his route; he was presumed killed. With Borleias conquered, the Rogues moved their headquarters there. To replace their losses, Captains [[Aril Nunb]]&mdash;herself the initial candidate for the executive officer position&mdash;and [[Pash Cracken]] joined the unit, though the A-wing veteran Cracken had to accept a demotion to lieutenant to do so. Due to Celchu's status as a security risk, command would fall to Nunb if Antilles were absent or incapacitated.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nOver a month of time at Noquivzor, Celchu had Horn, a former investigator for the [[Corellian Security Force]], look into Emtrey's odd behavior. After that month, Horn was able to trace the droid's history and determine that he had been equipped with black-market trading programs by a supply officer in the past for the purpose of swifter requisitions. During that conversation, Horn, who had become suspicious of Celchu's continual and unexplained guards, requested the truth from Celchu about why he was considered a security risk, and the captain explained but made Horn promise not to spread the story.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\n===Taking Coruscant===\n{{Quote|Tycho has been here as long as the rest of us have and has been working for me. I wanted one sabacc card that wouldn't change value on me and he was it. He'd been to Coruscant inside two years ago, knew how to get around, and, as we saw just now, has turned out to be very useful.|Wedge Antilles, to the rest of Rogue Squadron|X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble}}\nIn [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], it was decided that the New Republic should strike at Coruscant. Rogue Squadron was [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|assigned]] to infiltrate the planet and provide reconnaissance, but before doing that they were tasked with removing several prisoners from [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]]. They were able to free one hundred fifty political prisoners in exchange for taking sixteen of the most hardened inmates with them, though the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]-related criminals were in fact the goal, freed to help create chaos on Coruscant and occupy the Empire.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nThe Rogues were inserted onto Coruscant in small, covert groups, but Celchu was left entirely out of the operation due to security concerns. Antilles, however, was wary of the mission and wanted someone he could trust present on Coruscant without anyone else's knowledge, a backup who could not be compromised. To that end, he had Celchu and Emtrey make their way onto Coruscant while [[Whistler]], Horn's astromech, logged false reports on Noquivzor to suggest they were still present.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /> Celchu helped provide resources for Antilles, arranging hideout, as well as purchasing six [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]] fighters, for which he met with [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] smuggler [[Lai Nootka]] in [[The Headquarters]] cantina in order to purchase spare parts.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /><ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" /> While Celchu was on Coruscant, Warlord [[Zsinj]] attacked Noquivzor with the [[Iron Fist (Executor-class)|''Iron Fist'']], devastating the facility; Celchu was assumed killed, as no one but Antilles knew he was not present.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nWhen an attempt to insert sabotaged programming into Coruscant's main computer was ambushed by Imperial forces, Antilles contacted Celchu, who flew a Headhunter in to destroy the pursuit and cover the Rogues' escape. While Antilles had been gone, a message had come through for him ordering Rogue Squadron to bring down Coruscant's shields within two days in preparation for a New Republic assault, which Celchu relayed. Having been reunited with the squadron, Celchu immediately became a target of suspicion by Horn, who had witnessed the very end of Celchu's meeting with Nootka and was convinced, having seen only Nootka's physical mannerisms and not his face, that Celchu had been meeting with [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] agent [[Kirtan Loor]]. Antilles was confident that Celchu had not betrayed them, as the hideout Celchu had arranged was the only one not raided by Imperials.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho-guns.png|thumb|right|180px|Celchu in his preferred civilian dress and armed for combat]]\nWith Celchu reintegrated with the squadron and the Intelligence agents aiding them&mdash;Horn's former Corellian Security partner, [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]], and Winter&mdash;they began devising ideas to bring down the shields and settled on a scheme in which they would take control of an [[Orbital Solar Energy Transfer Satellite]] and use it to boil off a reservoir, creating a massive storm that would collapse the power grid. Celchu was assigned to the team that would take over the ground control facility for the satellite. Before the mission, he checked over Horn's Headhunter, the one he had used previously, and spoke with Horn, who told him that he thought Celchu was a spy and planned to do his best to unmask the spy in the unit after taking Coruscant. Celchu calmly told Horn that he was innocent and any investigation would bear him out.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nCelchu commanded the infiltration of the command center, which had been evacuated due to Antilles redirecting a [[EVS Construction Droid|construction droid]] toward it. The presence of [[Fex-M3d]] gas in the control room threatened to keep them from being able to carry out their mission, but Qrygg, who as a [[Gand/Legends|Gand]] did not respire, was present on the team and was able to access the room. Winter was able to slice in and take control of the satellite, successfully creating a colossal storm. Backup power routes were able to carry power to the shields, however, resulting in Horn having to make a run against one of the alternate power substations. He was successful, but an override was used to take control of his fighter, plunging it into the ground.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\n===Vilification and vindication===\n{{Quote|Since my capture by the Empire right here on Coruscant I've been their prisoner. I've never really escaped the Empire because they managed to make others suspicious of me. I was outraged then and have been since, but protesting wouldn't do me any good. The only way I can be free, truly free, is for the Empire to be destroyed. I know, as it falls apart, someone somewhere will have the information that will set me free.|Tycho Celchu, to Wedge Antilles|X-Wing: The Krytos Trap}}\nInvestigation showed that the override codes used by the Empire to crash the fighter were ones Celchu had access to, and Horn had threatened to expose Celchu just before the mission. Celchu was placed under arrest for treason and the murder of Horn.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /> He was also charged with the murder of Bror Jace, who had disappeared on a route Celchu had plotted for him; the defection of the Interdictor [[Corusca Rainbow|''Black Asp'']] provided evidence from the captain that the ship had been provided with Jace's route and ordered to ambush and destroy him. The intelligence service investigated Celchu heavily, finding fifteen million credits, likely deposited by the Empire, in accounts under his name. Antilles insisted that his friend was innocent, however, and even addressed the [[New Republic Provisional Council]], asking them to prevent the trial, to no avail. Celchu was much calmer about the situation; he saw no point in displaying outrage and simply waited for evidence to be uncovered to exonerate him.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" />\n\nRogue pilot Nawara Ven, a former defense attorney, served as Celchu's counsel, and Horn's astromech, Whistler, also joined the defense due to its conviction that Celchu was innocent, bringing its law-enforcement experience to the team. As the trial was a military one run by a tribunal consisting of Admiral Ackbar and Generals Horton Salm and [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]], Emtrey also served on the defense team in order to advise Ven on points of military law. Celchu was faced by prosecutor [[Halla Ettyk]], a former star prosecutor from Alderaan, and Horn's former partner Iella Wessiri as her aide. Celchu was vilified among the public, though his colleagues in Rogue Squadron staunchly defended him.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" />\n\nThree weeks after the capture of Coruscant, the [[Trial of Tycho Celchu|Celchu trial]] began, heavily covered by the media and presented to the public as an example that the New Republic could be as harsh on Humans as on aliens. Ettyk began by calling the Rogues to the stand and establishing their confrontation before Horn's last mission as well as Horn's belief that Celchu had met with Loor. When Wessiri was called as a witness, however, Ven was able to cast doubt on Horn's identification of Loor and present the trial as unusually quick, a rush to judgment. Ven was also able to show that the fifteen million credits found in his name were highly unusual in that they were spread across more accounts than New Republic Intelligence had found for any other Imperial agent, were far more than had been paid to any other agent protected by the middling level of encryption on Celchu's supposed accounts, and had not been accessed by Celchu at any point&mdash;suggesting that Celchu was being framed, as had happened to Madine, one of the judges, in the past. While he was imprisoned between court sessions, Celchu was visited numerous times by [[Diric Wessiri]], Iella's husband and a former Imperial captive who was highly interested by Celchu's case and believed him to be innocent. Aside from Winter and his squadron mates and defense team, Wessiri was his only visitor. The trial was not going very well, however, and Celchu was convinced that if he took the stand, he could persuade the court of his innocence. Ven, however, refused to allow it, convinced that Ettyk would destroy Celchu on cross-examination.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" />\n\nThree weeks into the trial, Celchu's case was suddenly saved, however, when Ven was approached by Kirtan Loor, who offered to defect and share all he knew in order to gain protection from Isard. He could prove that Celchu had not met with him in the Headquarters cantina and so prove Celchu had nothing to fear from Horn and no motive to kill him. Loor, however, was killed on his way into court by Diric Wessiri, a Lusankya agent, and was in turn killed by his wife, who was escorting Loor; Ven was wounded in the incident. While Loor had provided a datacard with the information he had intended to reveal on it, it was encrypted and could not currently be used. Ackbar prepared to recess the court, but Celchu attempted to take the opportunity to represent himself and serve as a witness. At that moment, however, Horn entered the room. He had not been killed, but kept captive in Lusankya, where he had resisted the brainwashing and escaped. In doing so, he had accessed Lusankya's computer files and found that Celchu had not been brainwashed. Horn was sworn in and began to testify, but the proceedings were interrupted by Lusankya's escape from Coruscant. Isard had taken refuge in the ''Lusankya''&mdash;which was in fact a Super Star Destroyer buried in the Coruscant cityscape&mdash;after Coruscant's conquest and chose that time to depart, blasting through the shields and escaping. She took with her Erisi Dlarit, the true spy within Rogue Squadron.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" />\n\n[[File:TychoCelchu_swenc.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Celchu trial made Tycho Celchu a hated figure, but Airen Cracken's deception restored his reputation.]]\nIn the aftermath, intelligence chief [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]] revealed that he had been testing Celchu's loyalty by providing Emtrey, whose modifications made him a useful tool for a spy. When Celchu did not use them to betray the Rogues, Cracken knew he was not an active agent, though he could not dismiss the possibility that he had been brainwashed in Lusankya. Emtrey was able to monitor Celchu and confirmed he had met with Nootka; Cracken knew the case against Celchu was false and had only allowed the trial to go forward to lull the true spy into a sense of security. When Isard manufactured evidence to help convict him, Cracken knew she would not sacrifice a brainwashed agent and became fully confident of Celchu's innocence. With the trial now prematurely ended and all confidence in Celchu restored, Cracken went ahead with his original plan to end the trial and held a press conference in which it was stated that Celchu had willingly consented to the trial in order to draw out the spy, fully rehabilitating his public image without tarnishing that of the New Republic.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" />\n\nCelchu was now cleared to return to full flight operations, and aided the squadron in putting down the remaining cells of the [[Palpatine Counter-Insurgency Front]], a terrorist group led by Loor and badly undermined by his defection. A public ceremony in which Rogue Squadron was awarded the [[Coruscant Star of Valor]] provided the venue for [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] herself to deliver Celchu's exoneration to the public. He was reunited with Winter in the wake of the ceremony, and his former commander Luke Skywalker was present to congratulate him on his freedom. At that ceremony, Horn expressed his desire to pursue Isard, who had fled to the bacta-producing world of [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]] and been made its ruler in an internal coup. When Councilor [[Borsk Fey'lya]] told him that Rogue Squadron would not be allowed to interfere, as the matter had been internal and the New Republic feared isolating other worlds by meddling in the politics of a neutral world, Horn angrily resigned. Antilles agreed and resigned as well, followed quickly by Celchu and then the rest of the squadron with the exception of Pash Cracken. Determined to carry the fight to Isard on their own, Celchu volunteered the fifteen million credits supplied to him by Isard for use against her.<ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" />\n\n===The Bacta War===\n{{Quote|It was a great shot, Tycho. If I couldn't get her, well, your claim predated mine.''\"<br />\"''Corran, we got her. That's all that counts.|Corran Horn and Tycho Celchu|X-Wing: The Bacta War}}\nCelchu and Antilles immediately began planning their resistance, with Celchu selling the five surviving Headhunters from the capture of Coruscant, still his property, to museums and collectors as valuable historical items. Pash Cracken offered the use of a [[Yag-prime|space station]] over [[Yag'Dhul/Legends|Yag'Dhul]], which his squadron was tasked to deny to Zsinj, as the squadron's new headquarters and they accepted. Winter, Terrik, and Iella Wessiri were all integrated into the group as well. They moved to the station, and while Antilles was away acquiring parts Celchu was left in command. During that time, Winter discovered that all Rogue Squadron's fighters, equipment, and support droids had been listed as surplus by sympathetic officials and were being sold off. Celchu bought up the entire lot on the cheap, and their mechanical staff resigned as well and came to join them, putting the squadron in a far better position to take on Isard. Celchu had them begin customizing the X-wings' paint schemes and identification codes, as they were no longer in official service. Celchu had his fighter painted in the colors of the [[Alderaan Guard]] and used the identification code of the Alderaanian armory ship ''[[Another Chance]]''. The group was further joined by Mirax Terrik's father, legendary smuggler [[Booster Terrik]], and a team of professional anti-Imperial revolutionaries led by former Rogue Elscol Loro. Booster Terrik was placed in command of the space station, managing its operations.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\nThey began their attack on Isard by harassing her bacta convoys. Celchu flew as [[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]], leading Ven, Horn, and Qrygg in Two flight. In their first ambush, Celchu led a run on the freighters when they would not comply with the Rogues' hijacking and dealt with the fighters defending them. With their fighter escort removed, the freighters agreed to be diverted to New Republic or independent areas needing bacta. Celchu escorted a freighter to Coruscant, where he met some Alderaanian friends who persuaded him to make a [[Return (Alderaanian)|Return]], a ritualized ceremony of visiting [[the Graveyard]], the debris field where his homeworld had been, and expressing grief for Alderaan's destruction. Celchu decided to take the opportunity immediately. Though he resisted the efforts to make the Return a strict, impersonally regulated affair, he did give in to the custom of buying individualized gifts for the loved deceased. He struggled to find an appropriate way to memorialize Nyiestra, however, eventually settling on Winter's suggestion as perfect: a crystal replica of Alderaan with his first love's hologram embedded within. Celchu traveled to the Graveyard, launched his gifts, and made a speech to the victims promising he would fight to make sure no one else would suffer their fate. When he returned, the Rogues gained more pilots with a Twi'lek squadron led by the warrior [[Tal'dira]] joining and Bror Jace being discovered as alive on Thyferra, having avoided the ambush and leading the [[Ashern]] and remnants of the [[Zaltin Corporation|Zaltin]] cartel against Isard and her [[Xucphra Corporation|Xucphra]] cartel allies.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\nOn their next hijacking, they were ambushed by the [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Corrupter/Legends|''Corrupter'']] and Rogue [[Riv Shiel]] was killed, with Gavin Darklighter thought killed and only barely escaping to hyperspace. When Isard destroyed the colony of [[Halanit]] in response to its accepting stolen bacta from Rogue Squadron, Antilles, Celchu, and Jace planned a retaliatory strike against one of Thyferra's bacta-producing colonies. In it, they were joined by three [[Gand/Legends|Gand]] [[ruetsavii]] sent to monitor Qrygg and decide if he was worthy of the Gand [[Janwuine-jika|janwuine]] status. The facility on [[Qretu 5]] which they selected was destroyed, with Celchu receiving complaints from the plant manager over the comm; he ordered them to evacuate the town surrounding the facility and offer no resistance. The Rogues then moved up the pace of their harassment, striking convoys in varying strength and performing hit-and-fade attacks against the fighters escorting them. They also purchased missiles from smuggler [[Talon Karrde]], who had his freighters rendezvous with the Rogues' and perform transfers in order to keep the location of their base hidden.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\nOn one transfer in the Alderaan system, Celchu noted odd contacts on his identify friend/foe system from within the Graveyard, but was unable to make anything of them. His attention was diverted when an Interdictor and the ''Corrupter'' entered the system in an ambush. Antilles made a run against the ''Corrupter'' with four Twi'lek [[Chir'daki]] fighters as cover and the rest of the Rogues firing torpedoes based on his targeting data. Celchu, with an identical escort, made a second follow-up run, hoping to be able to catch the ''Corrupter'' with its shields down. When he began to broadcast his targeting data, a [[Thranta-class War Cruiser|''Thranta''-class War Cruiser]] moved out of the Graveyard and began attacking. The ''Corrupter'' was destroyed and Celchu made another torpedo run against the Interdictor, driving it off. Celchu was then able to determine that the cruiser was the [[Valiant (Thranta-class War Cruiser)|''Valiant'']], a droid-crewed escort for the ''Another Chance'' that thought Celchu's X-wing was its charge. He led it back to the Yag'Dhul station, where it was placed under the command of Nunb and Emtrey.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\n[[File:Tychomugshot.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Tycho Celchu]]\nCelchu, Antilles, and Terrik went to work on plans to defend their station if Isard were to attack it, placing a gravity well generator and tractor beams on the station to pin any attackers in place and a great many missile targeting packages on the station to bluff enemy ships into thinking they were hopelessly outmatched and surrendering. The actual missile launchers intended to have the targeting packages equipped were installed on the fleet of freighters working for Terrik to deliver supplies. When the Rogues received word that Isard was rounding up the native [[Vratix/Legends|Vratix]] on Thyferra to slaughter them, their hand was forced. They allowed Karrde's convoy to come directly to their base, having it betrayed to Isard by her spy in Karrde's organization. When the ''Lusankya'' and its escort the [[Errant Venture|''Virulence'']] arrived in the system, the fighters and freighters made as if fleeing to Thyferra to inflict what damage they could before the slower ''Lusankya'' caught up with them. In fact, the fighters rendezvoused with the ''[[Freedom]]'', formerly one of Isard's Star Destroyers but whose commander, [[Sair Yonka]], had defected. They were thus rested and refueled when they struck Thyferra, though the ''Lusankya'' had already returned and was waiting for them.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\nWith the ''Freedom'' supporting them, the fighters attacked the ''Lusankya'', attempting to disarm the Super Star Destroyer. The freighters, meanwhile, stood off and fired missiles based on targeting data from the X-wings, providing significant firepower. With Ven on his wing, Celchu alternated between making runs against the ''Lusankya'' and picking off the [[Thyferran Home Defense Corps]] TIEs defending the ship. When a ''Lambda''-class shuttle was detected leaving, Antilles sent Celchu's flight to intercept it, suspecting it was Isard fleeing. They engaged the squadron, commanded by the former spy Dlarit, which was escorting the shuttle, and Ven's fighter was destroyed, leaving him extravehicular. Horn hunted down and killed Dlarit while Celchu and Qrygg dealt with the rest of the fighter cover. With Dlarit destroyed, Horn tried to stop the shuttle. It had been modified, however, and its shields were too strong for the X-wing's lasers to overcome; he had spent all his proton torpedoes. Celchu desperately tried to catch up before the shuttle escaped to hyperspace, with Horn establishing missile locks in order to cause Isard to juke, break them, and so slow her progress. Finally, she determined he was bluffing and leveled out, enabling Celchu to fire his last proton torpedoes using Horn's telemetry. The shuttle was destroyed, and with the captured ''Virulence'' returned with Pash Cracken's fighter wing aboard, the ''Lusankya'' surrendered. The battle was over.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\nThe other prisoners aboard the ''Lusankya'', including General [[Jan Dodonna/Legends|Jan Dodonna]], had been shipped out and scattered, however, leaving a painful loose end. A moment of happiness occurred when Celchu and Wessiri served as witnesses to the marriage of Corran Horn and Mirax Terrik, performed by Antilles as the captain of the ''Lusankya''. The Rogues were invited to help train the new, New Republic-allied [[Thyferran Aerospace Defense Force]] and agreed. As Ven had lost his leg while extravehicular and could not utilize a prosthetic well enough to remain flight-qualified, he took on the duties of executive officer from Celchu. With their mission successful, the New Republic was willing to restore their commissions to the Rogues, an offer all of them accepted.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" /> In fact, the paperwork for their resignations was said to be lost, leading to their having retroactively been part of the military the entire time.<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\">''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]''</ref> Celchu and all the other Rogues attended Qrygg's [[janwuine-jika]] on [[Gand/Legends|Gand]], in which Qrygg was granted the privilege to speak of himself in the first person.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\">''[[I, Jedi]]''</ref> The Rogues were summoned back from Thyferra early and were welcomed back to Coruscant by a squadron doubling for the Rogues, led by Klivian, as part of a public relations move.

He departed from Rogue Squadron in order to form this new unit, dubbed [[Wraith Squadron]]; Celchu leveraged his ownership of the Rogues' X-wings to pressure Ackbar into assigning new fighters for the Wraiths, claiming he would otherwise not allow their use to the New Republic.<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\" /> While Antilles retained command of Rogue Squadron and intended to return to the unit when the second squadron was ready to operate on its own, Celchu was made the operational leader of the unit, with Klivian transferred back in to serve as second-in-command; Nunb had left for fleet service aboard the ''Valiant''.<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\" /><ref name=\"The Bacta War\" />\n\nWhile Antilles and Janson trained the new unit, Celchu and the Rogues were assigned to join the [[Solo Fleet]] in its campaign against Warlord Zsinj. The Rogues were present and ready for the [[Battle of Talasea]], a trap for the forces of Zsinj's subordinate Admiral [[Apwar Trigit]], but the Wraiths eliminated Trigit's forces on their own before the other forces were needed. The Rogues were also deployed with Wraith Squadron at the [[Battle of Ession]], decimating Trigit's fighter complement before his Star Destroyer, [[Implacable (Imperial-class)|''Implacable'']], was destroyed.<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\" /> When the Wraiths transferred aboard the ''[[Mon Remonda]]'', General Han Solo's flagship and the Rogues' base of operations, they began working with the Rogues in striking at Zsinj's facilities, such as the feint at [[Lavisar/Legends|Lavisar]].<ref name=\"Iron Fist\">''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]''</ref>\n\nWhen the Solo Fleet determined that Zsinj would attempt to hijack the Super Star Destroyer ''[[Razor's Kiss]]'', being completed at [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]], the Rogues were part of the force that intercepted his flight. A Wraith pilot had been able to sabotage the shields on the ''Razor's Kiss'', causing Antilles to order all squadrons to focus their attack on it; the ship was destroyed. Celchu then engaged ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} fighter screen, coming up against the dangerous fighters of Zsinj's impostor 181st, believed to be led by Fel himself, who had disappeared while Celchu was imprisoned. The battle was hard-fought, but eventually the Imperial fighters fled as ''Iron Fist'' blasted its way through Solo's blockade.<ref name=\"Iron Fist\" />\n\nWith the Rogues and Wraiths now operating together closely, Antilles took back the mantle of Rogue Leader, with Celchu moving to [[Rogue Two/Legends|Rogue Two]] as his wingman. The ''Mon Remonda'' returned to Coruscant for repairs before setting back out. At [[Levian]], investigating a Zsinj raid, the Solo Fleet fell into an ambush by a much-superior Zsinj force. The Rogues made an attack on ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} stern, reducing its maneuverability, before eliminating one of the Carracks in Zsinj's flotilla, allowing the Solo Fleet enough room to escape.<ref name=\"Solo Command\">''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''</ref>\n\nWhen Wraith Squadron infiltrated [[Saffalore]] in order to find out more about a scientific endeavor with links to Zsinj, Rogue Squadron infiltrated as well to provide backup. When the Wraiths struck the [[Binring Biomedical Product|Binring Biomedical]] facility, they were trapped by Zsinj's forces, having been expected. The Rogues received their signal requesting air support and immediately departed their base camp. TIE fighters had been called out to suppress the Wraiths, which the Rogues engaged and eliminated. They then attacked the local military base in order to divert attention from the Wraiths' escape.<ref name=\"Solo Command\" />\n\nAt [[Jussafet Four]], the ''Mon Remonda'' deployed against a Zsinj attack on the world. While the starfighters departed the cruiser, Tal'dira, who had joined the squadron after the [[Bacta War]], fired on Antilles, damaging his fighter. Celchu immediately interposed his ship between Tal'dira and Antilles and ordered the Twi'lek to stand down. He refused, and Antilles and Celchu set themselves up to run a head-to-head pass with Horn, who brought Tal'dira under his guns. When Tal'dira opened fire on Celchu after Celchu refused to get out of his way, Horn fired and killed him. Antilles took his damaged fighter in and let Celchu lead the squadron into battle. The entire unit was sickened by the death of their comrade and his unexpected betrayal, but engaged Zsinj's TIEs and a corvette; Antilles returned to the battle after swapping out to a different fighter.<ref name=\"Solo Command\" />\n\nIn the aftermath, Antilles called one of the Wraiths' infamously free-wheeling brainstorming sessions which Celchu and some other Rogues attended. They were able to determine that assassination attempts and terrorist attacks being carried out by nonhumans across the New Republic were linked to Zsinj, and suspected them to be an attempt to drive a wedge of species-based dissension into the New Republic. It was theorized that the agents were being forcibly brainwashed, and the group attempted to predict where Zsinj's brainwashed agents would strike next. They were successful in predicting that the next attacks would be a Sullustan-created ship accident and a Bothan-created slicing accident, and by passing their theories on to New Republic Intelligence, were able to avert the attacks and restore faith that there was not an alien conspiracy ongoing. In order to relieve the stress being felt by the highly-active pilots and crew, Antilles organized a day of recreation in which the officers' mess was turned into a zone in which the use of rank was forbidden and everyone was able to join in card games, astromech races, and other relaxation.<ref name=\"Solo Command\" />\n\n[[File:Celchu-Falsehood.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Celchu escorts the ''Millennium Falsehood'' off Kidriff 5.]]\nThe next day, Celchu undertook the first part of Antilles's plan to lure Zsinj into battle. A mockup of the ''Millennium Falcon'', dubbed the ''[[Millennium Falsehood]]'', would be flown into the Zsinj-controlled world of [[Kidriff 5]] by Antilles and Chewbacca with Celchu's X-wing attached to provide cover, dropping off intelligence agents to organize resistance before departing. Antilles hoped to build a pattern of such movement, bring Zsinj to believe Solo was operating behind his lines in the ''Falcon'', and eventually use it to pull Zsinj into a trap. They were able to infiltrate the planet and put down in a forest, where they released the intelligence agents and spent the night. In the morning, a police craft spotted them, establishing their presence and prodding Celchu and Antilles to take off. Backed up by four Wraith pilots in TIE Interceptors who had infiltrated earlier, they held off two squadrons of TIEs launched by the local authorities until the other Rogues and Wraiths arrived and began dogfighting. On their way out, Captain [[Garik Loran]] of the Wraiths accidentally revealed on an open channel that he knew [[Gara Petothel|Lara Notsil]], a Wraith pilot, to be Gara Petothel, an Imperial Intelligence agent who had worked for Zsinj. She had been responsible for an ambush that destroyed [[Talon Squadron (New Republic)|Talon Squadron]], Wraith [[Myn Donos]]'s first command. The traumatized Donos immediately made to attack Notsil, but Loran imposed himself between them. Donos launched a proton torpedo regardless, which would have struck Loran if Donos had not detonated it prematurely, snapping out of his anguish. Celchu meanwhile had established himself behind Donos and ordered him to maintain his course; Notsil fled. Celchu escorted Donos back to the ''Mon Remonda'', where Antilles ordered him to sort out his emotional issues.<ref name=\"Solo Command\" />\n\nThe Rogues continued flying a relentless mission load, frequently escorting the ''Millennium Falsehood''. When Solo was able to arrange an ambush of Zsinj at [[Vahaba]] by using an Interdictor cruiser to pin Zsinj in place, Celchu and the Rogues&mdash;in fact, the Solo Fleet's entire starfighter complement&mdash;were deployed against Zsinj's small flotilla. With Zsinj not having deployed his fighters due to his hope to run, the entire complement was able to line up and bombard ''Iron Fist'' before splitting up by squadron for further attack runs. The Star Destroyer ''[[Serpent's Smile]]'' was able to force the Interdictor off-course, however, allowing ''Iron Fist'' to escape. Just as they had accepted the failure of the ambush, the Solo Fleet received a message from Notsil, who had gained a position in Zsinj's fleet; she had orchestrated a sabotage of the ''Iron Fist''{{'s}} hyperdrive and stranded it in the [[Selaggis system]].<ref name=\"Solo Command\" />\n\nThe task force followed, with the Rogues and other squadrons searching for the ''Iron Fist'' in the system's asteroid belt. When it was spotted, they attacked. Celchu and Antilles observed the 181st departing ''Iron Fist'' and heading towards the location of a colony Zsinj had previously bombarded. Suspicious, they took the Rogues and Wraiths in pursuit. When Fel began strafing the ruins, Antilles led the squadrons against the TIEs. Fel and his wingman immediately engaged Antilles and Celchu, but when Fel's wingman suddenly decelerated and then exploded in a massive fireball, Celchu flew into the explosion, badly damaging his fighter. He turned to attempt to make it back over land, but came under attack from Fel and was forced to eject over the sea. Antilles shot down Fel and was able to expose that he was, in fact, an impostor serving to attempt to lure Antilles into a trap; half the fighters were droid-piloted bombs designed to detonate in combat. While Celchu was making his way towards shore, one of Zsinj's [[TIE/rpt starfighter|TIE Raptor]] reinforcements attempted to strafe him, but was downed by Notsil in her X-wing, having escaped the ''Iron Fist''. He was recovered and taken back to ''Mon Remonda''; ''Iron Fist'' was believed destroyed in the battle. The campaign against Zsinj was over, and Rogue Squadron was rotated into a less stressful assignment to let them recover.<ref name=\"Solo Command\" />\n\n===Combating Thrawn===\n{{Quote|You know, Rogue Leader, it occurs to me that those Imperials wouldn't have so many ships available to pound us with if they had to protect their shipyard at the same time.|Tycho Celchu, to Wedge Antilles|The Last Command}}\nIn [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], the Empire began escalating its strikes against the New Republic. When [[Bpfassh]] was struck, Han and Leia Organa Solo were sent there to view the damage and reassure the population. Rogue Squadron was assigned to their guard detail. When the Solos were threatened by an Imperial kidnap attempt, Solo was able to signal the Rogues with a plume of [[korfaise]] gas from the mockup ''Millennium Falcon'' used by the would-be kidnappers and the attempt was foiled.<ref name=\"Heir to the Empire\">''[[Heir to the Empire]]''</ref>\n\nThe Rogues were later assigned to protect the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate/Legends|Escort Frigate]] ''[[Larkhess]]'', converted to cargo-hauling duty due to a sharp lack of transport in the New Republic, from Coruscant to [[Sluis Van/Legends|Sluis Van]] and then from Sluis Van to Bpfassh. While waiting to depart at Sluis Van, Antilles noticed a suspicious freighter, one which claimed to be empty but handled as if loaded. Antilles scrambled the squadron and set out to investigate it, but as soon as Celchu and the others launched, it exploded, spewing TIE Fighters and [[Plasma-Jet Mole Miner|mole miners]] from its cloaked cargo bay. Immediately thereafter, a fleet of five Star Destroyers under the resurgent Empire's new leader, [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], arrived at the edge of the shipyards and began attacking. With the assistance of Solo and Skywalker, present at the shipyard in the ''Millennium Falcon'', Antilles was able to determine that the mole miners were being used to burn through the hulls of the understaffed cargo-transporting capital ships and hijack them. The mole miners had been stolen from Calrissian, also aboard the ''Falcon'', and he used his command signals to have the mole miners burn entirely through the bridges of the craft they had attached to, foiling Thrawn's scheme. The Rogues continued harassing the TIEs as Thrawn withdrew.<ref name=\"Heir to the Empire\" />\n\nWhen the New Republic received information on the location of the legendary lost [[Katana fleet]], Borsk Fey'lya blocked it from taking action swiftly. Leia Organa Solo and Talon Karrde, the source of the information, were convinced that any delay could put the fleet in the hands of the Empire, which had also found the location. Organa Solo dispatched a task force in the middle of the night under the command of Solo, Calrissian, and Skywalker to investigate the Katana fleet; Rogue Squadron was part of it. Fey'lya's task force, having set off the next morning, arrived with orders to arrest the prior group. Solo, aboard the ''[[Katana]]'', refused to give in but ordered the Rogues to comply with Fey'lya rather than risk a court-martial. As they did so, however, an Imperial Star Destroyer arrived. The Rogues immediately turned to fly cover for Solo's team as they attempted to leave the vulnerable ''Katana''. Fey'lya made to withdraw, but Organa Solo and Karrde were present aboard his ship and were able to expose his views on the military as being pawns to be disposed of for his purposes. The task force deserted him and moved to support the Rogues, who tried to hold off the drop ships attempting to board the Katana fleet [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|Dreadnaughts]]. One got through, however, boarding the ''Katana'' and trapping Solo's group aboard. A group of ships from Karrde's smuggler organization also arrived, helping even the odds, as did a task force under [[Garm Bel Iblis]]. Though another Star Destroyer arrived, Solo was able to ram it with one of the Katana Dreadnaughts under slave rig, leading the other Star Destroyer to withdraw. In the aftermath, however, it was found that the Empire had already taken off all but fifteen of the Dreadnaughts.<ref name=\"Dark Force Rising\">''[[Dark Force Rising]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:TychoBilbringi-TLC6.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Celchu piloting his X-wing at the Battle of Bilbringi]]\nCelchu continued battling Thrawn's encroaching campaign with the Rogues, fighting at the [[Battle of Filve]] and covering the retreat there, as well as serving as the front-runner in Bel Iblis's invention of the [[A-wing Slash/Legends|A-wing Slash]] at the [[Battle of Qat Chrystac]], a battle which was also lost. When Thrawn deployed several cloaked asteroids in orbit over Coruscant, the planet was closed to traffic due to fears of collisions and asteroid strikes on the planet itself if the shields were opened. The New Republic leadership decided it was vital to acquire a [[crystal gravfield trap]] array to detect the asteroids by their gravitic signature and decided to strike at the shipyards of [[Bilbringi system|Bilbringi]] to do so. However, they attempted to mislead the Imperials into thinking they would strike at [[Tangrene/Legends|Tangrene]], resulting in the Rogues being deployed nearby to draw Imperial attention. When the time came for the attack, however, the Rogues were pulled out to participate in the [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|Battle of Bilbringi]]. Upon arriving, however, they found that Thrawn had anticipated their strike at Bilbringi and was waiting with a large fleet. Celchu suggested the Rogues strike at the shipyards to force the Empire to split its forces, and Antilles was contacted by employees of Karrde who were hoping to stage a simultaneous attempt at the crystal gravfield trap, having thought the New Republic would be at Tangrene. Antilles arranged to cover their insertion into the shipyards while he and the Rogues attacked on the of the [[Golan II Space Defense SpaceGun|Golan II]] defense stations ringing the shipyards.<ref name=\"The Last Command\">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref> The Rogues attacked the station, softening it up for two [[Assault Frigate Mark I|Assault Frigates]] to destroy.

With Antilles finally above the rank of commander, Celchu was immediately promoted to colonel. When the Rogues made it back to Coruscant, a party was thrown to welcome them back. At the party, [[Urlor Sette]], a man who had been imprisoned with Horn on the ''Lusankya'', arrived and died from an implanted capsule of poison once Horn said his name. The Rogues immediately turned their efforts to finding the ''Lusankya'' prisoners, a duty from which they had been distracted over the past years by Zsinj and Thrawn. They were able to track the components in the capsule to [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]], where the Rogues planned to raid the [[Xenovet]] facility, an abandoned veterinary facility. After infiltrating the planet, the Rogues launched a strike at the Xenovet facility. They were only lightly opposed, and the New Republic commandos on the ground were able to take the facility, where they found several ''Lusankya'' prisoners left for dead&mdash;prisoners who attested to the fact that Ysanne Isard, alive, had been there within the last few weeks.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\n[[File:BattleofLiinadeIII.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Celchu flying in the Battle of Liinade III]]\nWhile the New Republic worked on analyzing that information, the Rogues were tasked with helping bring down Delak Krennel, who had set himself up as ruler of the [[Ciutric Hegemony]], and make an example to the other warlords. They struck at [[Liinade III]], one of Krennel's minor worlds. They engaged the fighter cover for the Star Destroyer defending the world, then escorted the assault shuttles carrying the ground forces onto Liinade III. They cleared the spaceport at [[Valleyport]], encountering four [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|AT-AT]] walkers; Celchu softened two up for Antilles to kill while Klivian and his wingmate [[Lyyr Zatoq]] finished the other two. The New Republic took the world, requiring the Rogues to spend three weeks on pacification missions, and in doing so discovered a research facility dedicated to revising plans for Krennel to build his own version of the Death Star, a development which highly alarmed the Provisional Council.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nIn order to search out the weapon's location of construction, the Rogues were assigned to escort a [[T-65BR X-wing reconnaissance starfighter|reconnaissance X-wing]] flown by former Rogue Nrin Vakil through the [[Corvis Minor system]], investigating a moon named [[Distna]] which could house the shipyards to build the superweapon. While making their investigative pass, they were ambushed by six squadrons of TIEs. They fought fiercely, but there were far too many fighters to defeat. Janson, [[Asyr Sei'lar]], and the two newest pilots were all shot down. They were only saved when two squadrons of [[TIE/D Defender|TIE Defenders]] arrived, eliminating the opposition and offering to tow the Rogues to safety. With no other choice, they complied with their Imperial rescuers.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nThey were taken back to a hidden base, where they learned that Ysanne Isard had, in fact, survived Thyferra, having faked her presence in the shuttle Celchu destroyed, and was running the facility. She had turned over the prisoners to [[Ysanne Isard (clone)|a clone of herself]] during the Bacta War, and the clone had scattered them and survived. The clone was currently working with Krennel and had gathered the prisoners on Ciutric. Isard intended to infiltrate the Rogues onto Ciutric as a squadron of mercenaries in TIE Defenders and have them work with the New Republic to destroy Krennel and her clone; in exchange, she would be given amnesty and be provided for by the New Republic. With the squadron reduced, Celchu moved to the position of Red Five, leading the second of two flights. They worked heavily in simulators to master the Defender; as a former TIE pilot, Celchu adjusted quickly.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nThe Rogues presented themselves to Krennel as [[Requiem Squadron]], a group of Imperials defecting to Krennel's regime. Celchu dyed his hair red, as did [[Inyri Forge]], and took on the alias of Major Teekon Pass with Forge posing as his sister. They were accepted onto Ciutric, where they spent a week training with Krennel's pilots and being integrated into his armed forces. A few hours before a fleet under Ackbar, summoned by a message from Antilles, was to arrive, the unit was scrambled by Krennel for a strike against Coruscant. They ignored the summons and instead began their mission, with Antilles leading One Flight to destroy the planet's shield generator and Celchu leading Two Flight against the defenses of the prison holding the ''Lusankya'' inmates. While Antilles was successful, Celchu was heavily opposed. When it became clear Isard's personnel were not coming to liberate the prison as promised, Celchu and Forge stayed in the air to provide cover while Horn, Qrygg, and Vakil raided the prison. Reinforced by One Flight, he was able to hold off the TIEs over the prison. Krennel was killed in orbit, Antilles killed Isard's clone, and Horn freed the prisoners, including Jan Dodonna. Isard herself was killed trying to seize the ''Lusankya'' from the Bilbringi shipyards. Returning to the New Republic, they learned that Janson had in fact survived, a joyful revelation.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\n===Rogue Leader===\n{{Quote|I present Colonel Tycho Celchu, leader of Rogue Squadron.|Wedge Antilles, to [[Geng Salaban]]|X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar}}\n[[File:Tycho_B-wing_CE5.png|thumb|right|200px|Celchu in his B-wing at the Battle of Phaeda]]\nWhen the reborn Palpatine launched his massive counterattack against the New Republic days later, Celchu and the Rogues battled relentlessly as the New Republic was driven back, participating in the defense of [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] against Palpatine's [[World Devastator]]s.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron game\" /> When Rogue Squadron was reorganized as a multi-starfighter unit above squadron strength in [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], Antilles transferred to fleet operations as captain of the ''Lusankya'', which served as the base of the new Rogue Squadron.<ref name=\"Crimson Empire Handbook\">''[[Star Wars Handbook 2: Crimson Empire]]''</ref> Celchu then became Rogue Leader.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" /> Celchu piloted a [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter/Legends|B-wing]] into the [[Battle of Phaeda]], where the new Rogue unit saw its first combat, successfully conquering [[Phaeda/Legends|Phaeda]].<ref name=\"Crimson Empire\">''[[Star Wars: Crimson Empire]]''</ref><ref name=\"Crimson Empire Handbook\" />\n\nThat arrangement did not last long, with Rogue Squadron returning to its traditional twelve-X-wing format by [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]]. In that year, the Rogues were tasked with countering Leonia Tavira's [[Invids|Invid]] pirates. They [[Battle of Alakatha|ambushed]] an Invid piracy attempt near [[Alakatha/Legends|Alakatha]]. With Klivian now his wingmate, Celchu led his One Flight against the pirate cruiser, disarming and disabling it while the other flights eliminated its fighter cover. The mission was somewhat disappointing in that the ever-elusive Star Destroyer ''[[Invidious]]'' did not come to the aid of the pirate group present, rendering the larger ambushing force useless. When they returned to Coruscant, Celchu had a meeting arranged that night with General Airen Cracken of New Republic Intelligence to discuss the Invids, but Horn called, having been convinced that his wife Mirax was missing. Celchu had Cracken and Horn meet in his office; Cracken told Horn that Mirax had been working for him, investigating the Invids, but he could not release information on her situation to Horn. Horn objected and took a leave of absence from the squadron to train as a Jedi&mdash;having known he was Force-sensitive since his escape from ''Lusankya''&mdash;and attempt to find Mirax.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" />\n\nSome time later, Horn contacted Celchu from Skywalker's Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 with the shocking news that Luke Skywalker had been incapacitated. Celchu immediately arranged a medical team and planned to fly the team to Yavin himself. Horn also requested massive amounts of [[Nergon-14/Legends|nergon-14]] explosive and made it clear to Celchu that he was not sure any of the other trainees could be trusted, and had Celchu put him through to Cracken. Celchu brought the team out, but they could not help the comatose Skywalker. Celchu's shuttle was armed with proton torpedoes and he offered to make a strafing run against the temple Horn said was the locus for the Sith spirit of [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], who had attacked Skywalker, but Horn judged it too dangerous. He did give Celchu the coordinates, however, and insisted that if he could not destroy it with the nergon-14, Celchu have it bombarded from orbit.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" />\n\nWhen the New Republic raided [[Xa Fel/Legends|Xa Fel]], the Rogues were part of the task force. During that [[Second Battle of Xa Fel|battle]], the ''Invidious'' attacked, unaware that there was a battle ongoing. The Rogues were sent against the pirate fighters, eliminating many of the ''Invidious''{{'s}} elite pilots. During the battle Celchu flew, without knowing it, against Horn, who had infiltrated the pirates in his attempt to find his wife. Horn desperately attempted to avoid being killed, finally winding up behind Celchu and landing two ion blasts, giving Horn enough time to retreat with the rest of the Invids. Celchu, however, turned and targeted Horn's fighter with a pair of proton torpedoes, which Horn narrowly avoiding using a maneuver he had learned from Celchu himself. With the battle dissolving, Celchu was impressed enough to congratulate Horn on his evasion using an open channel.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" />\n\nHorn was ultimately able to rescue Mirax and drive the ''Invidious'' into flight, at which point the Rogues were able to remove the [[Khuiumin Survivors|Survivor]] pirate gang, which Horn had infiltrated, from their base on [[Courkrus]] and take them to Horn on [[Susevfi]], where Celchu was able to make arrangements for them to become the defense force of Susevfi and find a peaceful resolution. Without the [[Jensaarai/Legends|Jensaarai]] Force-users on Susevfi, whom Horn had converted to the New Republic's side with the aid of a revived Skywalker, no longer aiding Tavira, the ''Invidious'' was no longer able to anticipate threats and became a much smaller menace; the Rogues intended to hunt Tavira down and eliminate her threat entirely.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" />\n\n[[12 ABY/Legends|The next year]], while returning from a patrol to Phaeda, Celchu encountered a mysterious [[Sentinel-class landing craft/Legends|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] near the [[Lenico Belt]], but lost the ship in the asteroid field. Suspicious, Celchu filed a report requesting the New Republic investigate the situation.

Valuable for its missile-manufacturing capacity, its populace revered fighter pilots and would only negotiate with one. Desiring to make Adumar part of the New Republic, the leadership sent Antilles as its representative; he was authorized to select three other elite pilot-ambassadors to accompany him. He selected Celchu, Janson, and Klivian. They were taken to Adumar aboard the Star Destroyer [[Allegiance (Imperial I-class)|''Allegiance'']], on which they were introduced to [[Hallis Saper]], the documentarian for the mission.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\">''[[X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar]]''</ref>\n\nWhile descending to Adumar in their fighters, they were challenged by four Adumari in their native [[Blade series]] fighters. The New Republic pilots easily shot down the attackers, but were confused by the apparently unexpected event, which nevertheless was not alarming to the other Adumari. They landed in a major plaza in the central city of [[Cartann]] to a heroic welcome. There they connected with their New Republic diplomatic liaison on the world, [[Tomer Darpen/Legends|Tomer Darpen]]. From there, they were escorted to their temporary quarters by Darpen and presented with local clothing to wear to the ball being held that night at the residence of the [[perator]] of Cartann. At the ball, the perator presented the group with [[Cheriss ke Hanadi]], the local [[blastsword]] dueling champion, as a native guide. There, they also encountered General Turr Phennir, now the leader of the 181st, and realized that Adumar was negotiating with both the New Republic and Empire; Antilles also noticed that Iella Wessiri was present, presumably as an agent of New Republic Intelligence. While investigating at the party, Janson and Klivian discovered that Cartann was, in fact, only a nation on Adumar and the planet had no world government, as they had been led to believe. Antilles decided to play dumb about these revelations, but sent Celchu and Janson to ''Allegiance'' to let them know that an Imperial Star Destroyer was likely in orbit on the other side of the world. From the ship, he brought back four comm headsets so that the pilots could talk privately during flights.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\nThe next morning, Red Flight, as they had designated themselves, began training on the local [[Blade-32 superiority fighter]]s. Multiple times, they had to deny challenges to aerial duels, a deeply-ingrained Adumari custom. That evening, they dined at the home of the Adumari [[Minister of Trade]] and, on their way back to their quarters, were attacked by six Adumari men. Celchu tackled one ambusher, beating him into submission as the other pilots and ke Hanadi dealt with the others. Celchu picked up a blastsword and searched the attackers for money, finding they were paid assassins.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho_Celchu.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Celchu in 13 ABY]]\nThe next day, their Blades were loaded with paint missiles and training lasers, per their specifications, for nonlethal duels, something held to be dishonorable in Cartann. They practiced first against each other. Used to far more maneuverable fighters, Celchu was defeated by Klivian. Only one Adumari flightknife&mdash;their term for squadron&mdash;was willing to engage in a simulated duel that day, and were easily defeated due to their insistence on going after Antilles for the greater honor defeating him would afford. Over the next days, they continued accepting challenges, alternating between Blades and X-wings, and found more and more pilots, including many from nations outside Cartann, willing to engage in simulated duels. When Darpen learned of this, he was enraged and ordered Antilles to play by the Adumari rules, claiming they were orders from the local [[New Republic Intelligence Service|NRI]] chief; he did not mention that he, in fact, was the local NRI chief. After Darpen left, the pilots shared their concerns over whether Adumar, with its death-centered culture, was worth bringing into the New Republic. While others were pessimistic, Celchu expressed his hope that the culture could be turned around; he felt their simulated duels were already beginning to bear fruit.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\nThe morning after Darpen's ultimatum, Darpen arrived and informed the pilots that the perator had called a conference regarding his progress in unifying Adumar under one world government. Celchu and the others attended in their [[New Republic dress uniform]]s, Antilles having decided to make a stand against Adumari culture. At the ceremony, the perator of Cartann declared the formation of a world government with himself at its head&mdash;but did so without consultation with any other nation. To them, he issued an ultimatum to join or face war. Meanwhile, ke Hanadi, suicidal after realizing Antilles was in love with Wessiri, accepted a series of blastsword challenges. She finally lost one duel and was badly injured. While Janson dueled the victor to avoid his killing her, Celchu and Klivian rushed ke Hanadi to the plaza where they had arrived, with Klivian arranging for a medical team to arrive and evacuate her to the ''Allegiance''; Celchu went up with the medical team.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\nHe returned, and the next day they spent flying and accepting more challenges, though there were distinctly fewer would-be duelers. That evening, they attended yet another ball, at which Antilles confronted Darpen, forcing him to admit that he was the local NRI chief and had instigated the war for unification in order to try to gain Adumar before the Empire's delegation could gain more traction. The perator announced that there would be war, several nations having refused to acknowledge his overlordship, and requested that the Imperial and New Republic pilots join Cartann in war. Antilles declined, resulting in the perator declaring them enemies of the state. Their X-wings were impounded and four Blades were held ready for them at the local air base. If they could make it to the air base and from there to the ''Allegiance'' without being killed by the mobs and pilots that would be out for their blood, they would be allowed to leave. ''Allegiance'' would not respond to comm contact, leaving them on their own.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\nArmed with blasters and blastswords, they were able to hold off the crowd outside the palace and steal an open transport in the courtyard. Under heavy fire, however, its engine failed and the four pilots had to jump into a building, where they donned local cloaks so as to be less conspicuous. Knowing that there would be large crowds outside the air base, they recorded a video of themselves, supposedly filmed by an Adumari. They broadcast the video, which was rebroadcast on the omnipresent flatscreens across Adumar, drawing the crowd away to the location of the film. Wearing women's clothes, they were able to make it inside the base, where they had a temporary reprieve until they launched. Instead of flying out of the hangar and into an ambush, they shot out the back wall and flew through that opening. They were beset by a much greater number of fighters, which they were able to hold off, but every one of their fighters took damage in the battle, leaving none of them spaceworthy. Janson was shot down outright, causing Antilles to dispatch Klivian to land and escort Janson to Wessiri's apartment. Celchu and Antilles descended to street level, where they were able to eliminate the last of their attackers. In the process, Celchu's cockpit canopy was destroyed, leaving him extremely vulnerable and limiting his speed. Yet another squadron made to attack, but one of the units the New Republic pilots had simulated with most closely intervened, deciding that it was dishonorable to continue attacking such damaged foes who had already proven themselves.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\nCelchu and Antilles landed and took hours making their way to Wessiri's apartment, where they found ke Hanadi and Saper had arrived with many of the pilots' personal possessions from their own quarters. Saper revealed a recording of Darpen requesting that the perator sentence Antilles and the others to death, claiming they had been shamed and could not bear to live any longer; in fact, he simply wanted Antilles dead to cover the tracks of his political maneuvering, much of which might be considered unethical by his superiors. They were contacted by agents of the [[Yedagon Confederacy]], one of the leading nations opposing Cartann, and smuggled to safety in Yedagon. There, Antilles was offered command of the resisting forces and accepted. He would have begun planning their war, but Celchu forced him to finally get some sleep and took over the planning himself, poring over reports. After analyzing the strength and battle tactics of Cartann and its satellite nations, and of the alliance opposing that group, Celchu decided that Cartann's superior forces would likely attack at noon the next day. He felt that their best hope would be a preemptive dawn attack on Cartann itself, before the enemy was prepared. Celchu also drew up an attack plan that would have the center of their force stall while the outer arms, containing their bombers as well as fighters, swept around the defending force to create an enveloping crossfire and have the opportunity to escort the bombers onward. Antilles added to the plans a transponder-switching system that let the highest-profile pilots identify as novices and random pilots identify as the most famous ones, using the Cartann focus on honor and duels against them, and a line of fighters on the ground where the engagements were expected, ready to ambush the oncoming forces.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\n[[File:Rogues-departing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Red Flight takes off, having recovered their X-wings.]]\nCelchu flew a Blade-32 into battle as Antilles's wingman, downing several fighters in the massive central dogfight. Once the Imperial pilots, who had agreed to fly for Cartann, arrived in their Interceptors, the Yedagon Blades were significantly outmatched. Red Flight made one pass against the Interceptors, killing [[Unidentified 181st pilot|one]] of the four 181st pilots, but found the rest of the Interceptors pursuing. Celchu was badly damaged by one of the Interceptors and then struck by a Blade's missile, downing his craft. A rescue craft recovered him, and then set off with the other Red Flight pilots to [[Cartann City]], where ke Hanadi had found their X-wings. They flew near street level through the city to a hangar near the perator's palace where the X-wings had been stored as booty. Landing, they transferred to their X-wings and burst from the hangar under fire. They sought out the Imperials, engaging them in a head-to-head attack that killed [[Unidentified 181st pilot 2|one]] 181st pilot and damaged Klivian's fighter. Klivian and Janson veered off to safety, with Antilles and Celchu playing damaged to lure the Interceptors to them. Celchu was able to bring his [[Unidentified 181st pilot III|pursuer]] into Antilles's field of fire, destroying him, and Phennir fled in the last Interceptor. The X-wings were then able to do what the Interceptors had, tearing through the Cartann forces.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\nEventually, the Cartann authorities ordered the Cartann fliers to surrender and Antilles was summoned to the palace, taking Celchu with him. There they found the allied forces in control of the palace, with the senior Cartann administrators and generals under their control. Only the perator refused to surrender. Antilles was able to persuade him to abdicate in favor of his son, a pilot who had flown simulated duels with Red Flight. The son, [[Balass ke Teldan]], entered into the united Adumari union, forming a world government that was able to petition for membership in the New Republic. Darpen was present, and Celchu and Antilles drew on him and forced him to rescind the comm blackout he had imposed. Celchu arranged for their prisoner to be taken to ''Allegiance'' and spoke with the ''Allegiance''{{'s}} captain to explain the situation before filing a report with NRI and Fleet Command.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\nWith peace arranged, a New Republic task force was sent to guard the planet against the inevitable Imperial counterattack. When it came, Celchu flew against the Imperial TIE attack. During the battle, he and Antilles engaged a TIE Defender. The Defender's pilot chose to go head-to-head with Celchu and was able to disable his fighter with ion cannon fire. Antilles killed that pilot and drove Phennir off. The attack was foiled and Celchu was recovered, leaving the mission to Adumar a success.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" />\n\n===Transition period===\n{{Dialogue|Celchu|Normally, we just shoot things.|Antilles|We keep trying to retire.

Darklighter was married in 11 ABY and Antilles wed Wessiri months after the Adumar mission, a ceremony to which Celchu was certainly invited. Celchu himself followed the trend, and in [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], shortly after the conclusion of the [[Almanian Uprising]], Celchu's long courtship of Winter culminated in marriage.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> Rogue Squadron participated in the evacuation of [[Thanta Zilbra (planet)|Thanta Zilbra]] ahead of [[Centerpoint Station]]'s use of the starbuster superweapon against that system's sun, a crisis that was resolved without further destruction of worlds.<ref name=\"Assault at Selonia\">''[[Assault at Selonia]]''</ref> In that same year, [[18 ABY/Legends|18 ABY]], Celchu and the others from the Adumar mission were interviewed by Saper for the [[holodocumentary]] ''[[Adumar: Five Years of Union]]''.<ref name=\"Pilots Wanted\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040401adumarmain|text=Adumar: Pilots Wanted|int=Adumar: Pilots Wanted|archivedate=20100325071306}}</ref>\n\nBy [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], Antilles was back in command of Rogue Squadron, which was assigned to General Bel Iblis's task force. Celchu moved to the position of [[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]]. While they were stopped at [[Morishim]], Celchu found an individual in the market who had news that information had come out implicating the Bothans in the destruction of the peaceful world [[Caamas/Legends|Caamas]] under Palpatine's reign. He sought out Antilles and Janson, who had met Lando Calrissian in the market, and brought them to hear. When he questioned the [[Morish]] about the source of his information, he claimed it came from the [[Old Recluse]] in the mountains. Curious about the Old Recluse's source of information, they took their X-wings and Calrissian's [[Lady Luck/Legends|''Lady Luck'']] up to the Old Recluse's cave. When they questioned him, Calrissian found an old Imperial listening post behind a curtain, the true source of the old man's information. While examining it, they noticed a Corellian Corvette entering Morishim space, and a Star Destroyer just behind it. The pilots scrambled, and were able to make it through the Star Destroyer's jamming to contact the other New Republic forces. Celchu was surprised to note that the Star Destroyer was firing on the Imperial Corvette. They could do no more than watch as the Corvette was disabled and pulled in, though they were able to dilute the jamming just enough to record a fragmentary portion of the Corvette's transmission, which they turned over to Bel Iblis.<ref name=\"Specter of the Past\">''[[Specter of the Past]]''</ref>\n\nAs knowledge of the Bothan involvement in Caamas's destruction spread, the New Republic was riven with dissent. Factions lined up in defense of the Bothans and against them, a crisis which could seemingly only be resolved with acquisition of the [[Caamas Document]], which would list the specific Bothan conspirators. The members of these factions took the opportunity of the controversy to fan the flames of old local conflicts, resulting in a badly unsettled situation. Bel Iblis's task force was called in to [[Sif'kric]] when the [[Sif'krie]]s' [[Frezh]]lix foes arrived over the world during the highly time-sensitive export of the [[pommwomm]] crop. Though the New Republic had to official ability to interfere with the Frezhlix force, which was not attacking, Bel Iblis was determined not to let Sif'kric's economy take such a massive blow. Acting under the justification of investigating a freighter suspected of smuggling, Rogue Squadron flew through the decrepit Frezhlix armada towards the freighter. Before they made it to the force, the Frezhlix panicked and opened fire, allowing Bel Iblis to decimate the blockading force. Shortly afterward, the task force was scrambled to retake the [[Mengjini]] comm relay station from dissident forces who had taken control of it.<ref name=\"Specter of the Past\" />\n\nOne week later, while stationed on [[Di'tai'ni]], Bel Iblis suspected trouble might be brewing and had the Rogues sleep in their cockpits. His hunch paid off, with an emergency request coming through from nearby [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]] in the middle of the night. The Rogues traveled to Bothawui to counter the [[Leresai]] attack force the Bothans claimed was coming. There, the Leresen fleet insisted that they be allowed to exact justice for the two Leresai killed in a riot on Bothawui&mdash;and Leresen justice demanded the lives of the killers or those of ten innocent of their tribe. Upon noticing a twenty-man space station outside the Bothan planetary shield, Antilles ordered Rogue Squadron, which had arrived ahead of the rest of the force, to interpose itself between the fleet and the station. However, Antilles and Horn noticed that their X-wings had been sabotaged, keeping them from firing. They were reduced to helplessness as they watched the Leresai force destroy the station.<ref name=\"Specter of the Past\" />\n\nIt was decided that the Caamas Document would have to be recovered, and so the New Republic High Command plotted a strike at the Imperial [[Ubiqtorate/Legends|Ubiqtorate]] base at [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]], one of the few facilities where a copy might be stored. Bel Iblis's task force was moved to [[Ord Trasi/Legends|Ord Trasi]] to begin staging for the assault. Celchu led Rogue Squadron there, as Bel Iblis, worried about leaving Bothawui in such a tumultuous situation, left Antilles and Horn behind to attempt to safeguard the Bothan shield generators, which Bel Iblis saw as a likely target for sabotage. When they were ready to attack, Antilles and Horn were recalled. The New Republic force would pursue Booster Terrik's ''[[Errant Venture]]'' into the system, with the Star Destroyer posing as an Imperial ship. The forces would attack the base's perimeter and serve as a distraction while the ''Errant Venture'' docked with the station and pulled an information raid.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref>\n\nThe battle went well, with the diversionary force staying just outside of the defense perimeter's effective range, but the ''Errant Venture'' was trapped inside enemy lines by Thrawn, who had reappeared on the Empire's side. The New Republic force surged in to save Bel Iblis, and at that moment Antilles was contacted by Talon Karrde, who claimed to have an Imperial code to enter the base and the ability to end the war if he could get an escort in. The Rogues guided him through the perimeter, where Karrde, with Imperial Supreme Commander [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]], was able to expose \"Thrawn\" as an [[Flim|impostor]] in Moff [[Vilim Disra]]'s grasp for power. Pellaeon negotiated a truce with the New Republic&mdash;the Corvette at Morishim had carried his envoy and was captured by forces loyal to Disra, keeping the New Republic from knowing of his overtures&mdash;and Luke Skywalker and [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], now engaged, brought back a copy of the Caamas Document from the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]].<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" />\n\n[[File:Ushersofdeath.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Celchu, Darklighter, and Antilles drive off the swoop gang attacking the Skywalker-Jade wedding.]]\nNews of the impending wedding between Skywalker and Jade reached Celchu in Rogue Squadron headquarters on Coruscant. He was invited to Skywalker's bachelor party at the [[Red Rancor]] cantina. The party had only barely begun, however, before they were attacked by a swoop gang looking for trouble. With multiple pilots, Jedi, and smugglers present, as well as Chewbacca, they were easily beaten. The party left the cantina for less hostile parts. Winter was upset to find that Celchu had been fighting and urged him to take care of his hands, but he refused, resulting in their being swollen the next morning. On that day, he and the other men in the wedding went for their fittings. At the wedding, just before it was to begin, Karrde came to Antilles and the others with [[Banner Sumptor]], a man who had been part of a rogue Imperial Moff's scheme to disrupt the wedding and assassinate Skywalker and Jade, but who had had a change of heart. Antilles insisted that the ceremony go on and took command of the defense, assigning several of the old hands present to security duties. Antilles, Celchu, and Darklighter guarded the main door against an attacking swoop gang intent on causing a distraction; Celchu recognized the gang as being the same group from the Red Rancor. The three armed Rogues were able to shoot down several of the swoopers, driving them off. Inside, Skywalker was able to talk down the Moff, resulting in an eventful but ultimately peaceful ceremony.<ref name=\"Union\">''[[Star Wars: Union]]''</ref>\n\nLater that year, given the peace with the [[Imperial Remnant]], Celchu retired.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> Antilles had already retired, and many of the veteran Rogues did the same.<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Onslaught\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]''</ref> Gavin Darklighter was selected as the next Rogue Leader and promoted to colonel. Antilles and Celchu were proud to welcome the young pilot to the position they had held, and had a silver ring made for him with the squadron crest and the four dots of a colonel's rank badge. They presented it to him after treating him to dinner at an expensive restaurant and discussing the issues related to command. While they were ready to offer advice for Darklighter, they made it clear they had every confidence in his ability to lead the squadron.<ref name=\"Onslaught\" />\n\n===Return to war===\n{{Dialogue|Darklighter|What are you two doing here?|Antilles|We heard from various sources that you're going to be going to war.

They approached Darklighter and offered their assistance in any way possible.<ref name=\"Onslaught\" /> With their commissions reactivated, they helped Darklighter vet new candidates for Rogue Squadron, which had taken heavy casualties against the extragalactic [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invaders, as well as examining reports on the strange, biotechnology-using attackers. They served as advisers to Darklighter and his superior, fleet commander Admiral [[Traest Kre'fey]], as well as simming against the new Rogues, among whom was [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]]. Despite their protestations of age, they remained skilled enough to regularly beat the new fliers. In combat, Celchu served as flight control. He fulfilled that role over [[Garqi/Legends|Garqi]], where a commando team under Corran Horn's command was inserted to the enemy-held world. When the ''[[Ralroost]]'' returned there to pick up the team, they found a much larger Yuuzhan Vong force than they had anticipated. They were saved by the arrival of an Imperial Remnant force under Pellaeon, which was able to drive off the Yuuzhan Vong long enough to recover Horn's group.<ref name=\"Ruin\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Celchu-Darklighter-Karrde.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Celchu with Darklighter, his and Antilles's successor as Rogue Leader, and Talon Karrde]]\nOn Garqi, Horn had learned that the Yuuzhan Vong's [[Vonduun crab/Legends|vonduun crab]] armor was allergic to the pollen of the [[bafforr tree]]. The combined task force hurried to [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]], home of the bafforr, to defend this valuable asset against the Yuuzhan Vong. While there, Celchu flew in simulators against both the New Republic and Imperial pilots. With the Imperials were three [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] squadrons from the [[Empire of the Hand]] under Colonel [[Jagged Fel]], the young son of Soontir Fel. Fel defeated everyone else in the simulators; Celchu was only able to kill him once in simulation. Antilles was the only other pilot who did so, also only once. When the Yuuzhan Vong came, they were able to hold them off, and Horn negotiated a truce with [[Shedao Shai]], the enemy commander. Horn had, on a previous mission, recovered the remains of one of Shai's ancestors and used them as leverage. He and Shai would duel after the expiration of the week's truce. If Shai won, Horn would return the bones of [[Mongei Shai]]. If Horn won, Shai would lead his fleet away from Ithor and leave it in peace. Horn won, but Shai's lieutenant betrayed the deal, launching a biologically engineered plague that destroyed all life on Ithor's surface, a shocking setback for the New Republic.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nKre'fey and the Rogues continued prosecuting the war against the Yuuzhan Vong. When the Jedi [[Kyp Durron]] came to Solo with information about a Yuuzhan Vong superweapon at [[Sernpidal/Legends|Sernpidal]], he persuaded Antilles and Kre'fey to strike against it. Kre'fey's fleet was able to destroy it, though it was ultimately revealed that Durron had deceived them, and the supposed superweapon was actually a [[Koros-Strohna|worldship]], the destruction of which would put significant pressure on Yuuzhan Vong resources.<ref name=\"Rebirth\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''</ref> Rogue Squadron rotated to Coruscant and Celchu with them, remaining as Darklighter's immediate superior and flight controller; Antilles rotated with the unit as well. While there, Han Solo informed them that a ship inbound to Coruscant, ''[[Sweet Surprise]]'', was likely affiliated with the [[Peace Brigade]], a group of Yuuzhan Vong collaborators. Rogue Squadron arranged to intercept it, and Darklighter ordered it to stop for inspection. When it would not, General [[Carlist Rieekan/Legends|Carlist Rieekan]], commander of the [[Coruscant Planetary Defense Force]], ordered Darklighter to prevent it from entering Coruscant's defensive mine shell. Instead of stopping, the ''Surprise'' attempted to pull a flip-over and run, but&mdash;as Celchu, the flight controller, had warned its crew&mdash;it was too long for the safe lane. Several mines disabled the ship, and Darklighter and the Solos were able to take control of it. Soon after, Coruscant was lost to the Yuuzhan Vong in a massive battle. Rogue Squadron, Kre'fey, and Antilles&mdash;now in command of [[Fleet Group Three]]&mdash;were unable to stop them.<ref name=\"Star by Star\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref>\n\n===Stand at Borleias===\n{{Quote|We're going to face them with an enemy they've never had the displeasure of fighting. We're going to hit them with the Empire.''\"<br />\"''They're not going to like the Empire.|Wedge Antilles and Tycho Celchu, to Iella Wessiri Antilles|The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream}}\nWith Coruscant conquered by the enemy and Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya killed, the New Republic was thrown into chaos. Antilles gathered as many of the New Republic forces as he could and retreated to Borleias, which had been conquered by the Yuuzhan Vong. Antilles deployed the [[Mon Mothma (Imperial-class)|''Mon Mothma'']]{{'s}} starfighters and ground forces against it, [[Battle of Borleias (Yuuzhan Vong War; Second)|reconquering]] the world. Antilles established his base in the old Alderaan Biotics facility and put Celchu in command of the starfighter complement as his right-hand man. In the middle of the night three days after taking the planet, Celchu was roused to attend a meeting with the [[New Republic Advisory Council]], as were Antilles and his other senior officers and advisers. There, they learned that Councilor [[Pwoe]] had declared himself chief of state. Pwoe ordered Antilles to hold Borleias, but Antilles could tell that Pwoe intended him to simply stay and die, buying Pwoe time to bolster his defenses and negotiate a truce with the Yuuzhan Vong. Antilles refused, at which point Pwoe offered Celchu a promotion to the rank of general and Antilles's command, which Celchu easily refused. Antilles offered a deal: he would accept the command if Pwoe would grant him the forces he currently had at Borleias, all those currently underway to Borleias, the ''Lusankya'', supplies, and the right to transfer any willing soldier to Borleias. Celchu immediately began surreptitiously cutting orders to various other Fleet Group Three assets recalling them to Borleias. Pwoe reluctantly agreed, confirming Antilles's assessment that he had given up on the New Republic. After the others had cleared out, Skywalker proposed that they create a new Rebel Alliance, a group which had not given up and could be prepared to continue the war against the Yuuzhan Vong. Only those all the members would trust with their lives would be a part of it. In that way, Celchu, Antilles, Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, Calrissian, Darklighter, Horn, Booster Terrik, and [[Danni Quee]] formed the [[Insiders]].<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref>\n\nAntilles was determined to hold out, safeguard the passage of refugees from Coruscant, and make a stand at Borleias significant enough to improve New Republic morale and damage that of the Yuuzhan Vong before retreating. Celchu and Antilles began planning strategies to lure whatever Yuuzhan Vong commander would be sent against them into underestimating them, focusing on innovative methods of guerrilla warfare and misdirection. In order to keep themselves thinking creatively, Celchu would brainstorm as Antilles and Antilles would play the role of the Yuuzhan Vong commander in their planning sessions. Celchu spent much time discussing anti-Yuuzhan Vong starfighter tactics. Meanwhile, the Insiders plotted to start up resistance cells across several worlds likely to be targeted by the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" />\n\nWhen the enemy fleet arrived, Antilles commanded from the ground and had the elite squadrons stationed there, helping create the impression that something important was on the ground. Celchu coordinated the starfighters in the defense, forcing them to appear unprepared and allowing the sensor station on [[Pyria VI]]'s moon to fall. They wanted to manipulate the commander sent against them, whom they assumed to be merely average, and draw out a stalemate over Borleias as long as possible. However, they were unable to stage the defeat they wished, as the ''Lusankya'' arrived in the system during the battle, decanting from hyperspace into the heart of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, which it savaged. Celchu coordinated the arrival of ''Mon Mothma'' and several other ships and starfighters to support the ''Lusankya'' and guide it clear of the enemy fleet.<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho_Celchu_helmet.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Tycho Celchu's Rogue squadron helmet]]\nAs Yuuzhan Vong ships preying on refugee convoys became a greater problem, Antilles and Celchu worked with Calrissian to root out the source of information on the convoys. They were able to eliminate the possibility of tracking devices, deciding that refugees had to be selling each other out for rewards or under duress. In relatively short order, a new Yuuzhan Vong fleet showed up under one of the Yuuzhan Vong's most celebrated tacticians, [[Czulkang Lah]].<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" /> Celchu and Antilles began the public exposure of a plan they had put together to decoy Lah. [[Starlancer Project|Operation Starlancer]] featured four [[pipefighter]]s, cobbled-together craft which could focus several laser beams into a larger laser beam, which they intended to pass off as a mysterious superweapon they could use to manipulate Lah. They sent them up multiple times to run tests, making Lah curious.<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" />\n\nEventually, they performed a test-fire in which the pipefighters fired their concentrated beam. Along the same trajectory, a ship at the edge of the Coruscant system fired on the Yuuzhan Vong command worldship, fooling Lah into thinking that the beam had been launched through hyperspace as part of a superweapon system.<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" /><ref name=\"Rebel Stand\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]'</ref> During the test-firing, Jaina Solo's [[Twin Suns Squadron]] was ambushed. The Yuuzhan Vong desired her for a twin sacrifice with her brother [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]]. Chagrined at not having anticipated this tactic, Celchu watched with Antilles as Twin Suns tried to escape. He ordered a task force to depart, but knew it would be highly unlikely to get there in time to save them. Jagged Fel, flying with the squadron, was able to devise a strategy that got the rest of the squadron out of the ambush, but was knocked off course back into the massive swarm of Yuuzhan Vong [[Yorik-et|coralskippers]]. While the other Twin Suns fled, Solo and Durron plunged back into the fight to rescue Fel. Antilles knew it was hopeless, and Celchu relayed his direct order to break off and give up on Fel, his own nephew. Solo ignored him, and Durron used a desperation Force technique, pulling one of the Yuuzhan Vong interdictor's gravitic-singularity shields around and onto the ship, destroying it. At that point, the task force arrived, saving all three pilots against the odds. Celchu greeted them when they returned to the grounds, ordering the exhausted Durron to get rest and taking Solo and Fel to see Antilles. Celchu and Antilles let the pair wait as they finished debriefing Darklighter, then invited Solo in for a dressing-down. She, however, had left and Fel was in her place. He explained that he believed her refusal of orders was a one-time incident. Unhappily, Antilles let her go without punishment.<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" />\n\nWhen Antilles and Celchu allowed information to fall into the hands of a Yuuzhan Vong agent suggesting that a massive [[lambent]] crystal was being grown in the base to focus the Starlancer beam into a superlaser, it forced Lah to act. Lah began landing forces on Borleias's surface, which Celchu and Antilles did not stop. Instead, they planned [[Operation Emperor's Hammer]], using the ''Lusankya'' to deliver an orbital bombardment which would wipe out Lah's ground forces. Forty-nine days into the occupation of Borleias, Celchu detected what seemed to be Lah making his move. He called Antilles back to headquarters and began preparing the defense. As starfighters and ground forces fought back against the invaders, Celchu and the other controllers continually ordered them back until they were all safely next to the base. At that point, the ''Lusankya'' opened up, razing everything outside the safe zone for four minutes of bombardment. Lah's attack failed.<ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" />\n\nTheir defense of Borleias attracted Wes Janson, who had commissioned the [[Taanab Yellow Aces]]. Janson brought his squadron and a shipment of supplies to the defense, where Celchu was overjoyed to see his old friend. Lah continued launching harassing attacks against the New Republic forces, drawing down their resources. As the ''Lusankya'' took more and more damage, some of its weapons were stripped for use on the ''Errant Venture'' and a durasteel-and-explosives spear was built through its core, turning the slowly-dying ship into a massive ram.<ref name=\"Rebel Stand\" />\n\nWhen the constant attacks became overwhelming and Antilles decided they had accomplished as much as they could, they put their final plan into effect: [[Operation Emperor's Spear]]. They sent up the pipefighters, equipped with a false giant lambent, up to force Lah into making an all-out attack, and under cover of the battle began the full evacuation of Borleias, having already transferred many people into orbit. Antilles stayed behind to coordinate the attack until the last minute while Celchu made sure a shuttle was ready was for Antilles and transited up to ''Mon Mothma'' while the ''Lusankya'' began moving towards the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, preparing to ram it. If he were to lose contact with Antilles, Celchu would take command of the operation. Antilles did indeed lose contact while transiting to orbit, forcing Celchu to take over. He jumped ''Mon Mothma'' in near the ''Lusankya'' to use its gravity-well projectors to keep Lah's command worldship's [[dovin basal]]s from being able to pull the ''Lusankya'' off course. The massive Star Destroyer successfully rammed the worldship, killing Lah and turning the retreat into a costly affair the Yuuzhan Vong could hardly call a victory.<ref name=\"Rebel Stand\" /> The defense, including Celchu, was presented in the documentary [[Battle of Borleias (holodocumentary)|''Battle of Borleias'']] by noted historian [[Wolam Tser]], which proved immensely popular and helped restore morale throughout the New Republic.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref>\n\n===Victory and peace===\n{{Quote|The Alliance will just have to make do with guys like Darklighter, Page, and Cracken.''\"<br />\"''Pity the Alliance.|Wedge Antilles and Tycho Celchu|The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force}}\nCelchu moved on to [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]] with Antilles, where they organized its defense and prepared resistance cells in the event that it fell to the enemy. Winter was safe as well, taking care of the elderly retired Admiral Ackbar, her old friend, on [[Dac]]. Ackbar in fact came back from retirement to mastermind a strategy which saw the death of Yuuzhan Vong [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]] at the [[Battle of Ebaq|Battle of Ebaq 9]]. Combined with the restoration of stability under the newly-elected [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Cal Omas]] and the reformation of the New Republic into the more centralized [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]], the situation began to look more hopeful for the residents of the galaxy.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\nBy [[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]], Celchu was promoted to the rank of general. He was present at the major high command conference over [[Contruum Six]], in which the attack to retake Coruscant was planned. Celchu interrupted the meeting to share news from Winter that Ackbar had passed away. Commanding the Star Destroyer [[Elegos A'Kla (Imperial-class)|''Elegos A'Kla'']], Celchu was one of many senior fleet officers present at the battle to retake [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]] as a stepping-stone to Coruscant. He worked with General [[Keyan Farlander/Legends|Keyan Farlander]] to keep the Yuuzhan Vong contained, and when Peace Brigade starfighters launched from Corulag, Celchu dealt with them.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nWith victory, Celchu, Antilles, and Farlander rendezvoused with the [[Galactic Alliance Second Fleet|Second Fleet]] and jumped to [[Muscave]], one orbit out from Coruscant in the Coruscant system. Their fleet stood between Coruscant and the living planet [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]], which had jumped through hyperspace into the system. Warmaster [[Nas Choka]], determined to destroy Zonama Sekot, led his fleet against the Second, opening Coruscant for a strike by the [[Galactic Alliance Fourth Fleet|Fourth Fleet]] under Pellaeon, which began landing troops. The Second was under significant strain, but was eventually reinforced by Kre'fey's [[Galactic Alliance First Fleet|First Fleet]]. Meanwhile, on Coruscant, Luke Skywalker and Jacen Solo killed the Yuuzhan Vong [[Supreme Overlord]] as well as the power behind the throne, pushing Choka to cease fighting and consolidate his forces in-system without attacking.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\n[[File:TychoCelchu-ActionFigureCard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tycho Celchu in A-wing pilot's gear]]\nWhen Choka came to the decision to surrender, Celchu was among the more than five hundred officers and officials present at the massive ceremony, seated prominently among the highest-ranked commanders and politicians at the head of the assembly. Afterwards, he and Antilles met up with Han Solo, Calrissian, Karrde, Booster Terrik, and [[Crev Bombaasa/Legends|Crev Bombaasa]] on Zonama Sekot, where they shared a bottle of brandy in the cold, discussing the course of the war, their fates after it, and the political and economic fallout. Celchu mentioned that he intended to retire the next day, in compliance with Winter's wishes.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nCelchu, however, was either convinced not to retire or did not stay retired. He returned to Starfighter Command, where he served as a training officer, a duty which allowed him regular hours and safety while still contributing to the defense of the galaxy, likely an acceptable compromise for Winter.<ref name=\"Fury\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''</ref> During the course of the next decade, he trained [[Syal Antilles]], who enrolled under the pseudonym Lysa Dunter in order to avoid being burdened by her father's reputation, in interceptor piloting.

As tensions mounted between Corellia and the Galactic Alliance, the Galactic Alliance took action to force Corellia into compliance, which backfired and resulted in a military occupation of [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]] in the [[Corellian system]]. A conference at [[Toryaz Station]] between Pellaeon and [[Five World Prime Minister]] [[Aidel Saxan]] was set up in order to talk out the issue and keep Corellia from seceding&mdash;and possibly using Centerpoint Station or the war fleet it had built in secret. Celchu attended the conference, where he served as head of security for Pellaeon and the Galactic Alliance party; the Jedi provided a neutral force for security as well. On the station, he met Antilles, who had taken a position with the Corellian forces after an ill-advised attempt by the Galactic Alliance to keep him incarcerated and unable to come out of retirement on Corellia's side&mdash;something he had no intent to do before being so treated. They regretfully discussed being on different sides of the conflict; Celchu was upset to be in such a position. The negotiations began with a ball in the evening, at which Celchu and Antilles helped warm relations between both parties by walking together and speaking with members of both groups, who were otherwise clustered by affiliation. Genuinely not caring about which side was which, their friendly sharing of stories helped break the ice. Celchu was the first to take to the dance floor, dancing with Saxan; Antilles followed with Leia Organa Solo.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho_Celchu_NEGTC.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Celchu in his dress uniform]]\nThe negotiations went on for hours after the party before the diplomats retired to bed. Celchu and Antilles came to the conclusion that both leaders should sleep in rooms other than those they were assigned to. Pellaeon was moved to a supposedly unoccupied room, while [[Gilad Pellaeon (impostor)|a decoy]] was installed in Pellaeon's room. The precaution was fortuitous; that night, a large body of assassins attacked the negotiators. The decoy was killed, but Celchu and the security officers present were able to kill the assassins before Organa Solo arrived to offer her assistance. Pellaeon was safe, but Saxan's security chief had not taken the advice to alter her room assignment and as a result Saxan had been killed. Celchu and Antilles immediately took charge of the situation, ordering that section of the station locked down, ordering evidence preserved, and beginning an investigation, which they turned over to Luke Skywalker to coordinate.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nCelchu and Antilles were assigned to investigate along with the Jedi contingent. They requested the hologram recordings at the time of the incident, but found there were none. They then turned to the engineering department to look for logs of door openings, and found that one far airlock had been opened. They then went to the airlock, where they met with Jaina Solo and the Jedi [[Zekk]]. Using the investigative skills they had learned from their wives, the two old pilots searched for evidence, where they discovered a strange tassel. They traded it to the Jedi to examine in exchange for a lead they had picked up suggesting the Toryaz Station security chief for their section, who had gone missing, was floating in space. Celchu, Antilles, and Skywalker took a shuttle out and homed in on Captain [[Siron Tawaler]]'s comlink, finding his body in the vacuum, having seemingly willingly stepped out the airlock. Meanwhile, they also learned that the assassins had been a group of Corellians suffering from terminal diseases and that a single shuttle, presumably containing the mastermind of the plot, had escaped just as the attack began. However, when the regular request for an update on the situation came in from Coruscant, Celchu and Pellaeon were obliged to reveal the events of that night, ending their investigation as the Galactic Alliance dispatched a forensics team.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nThe debacle at Toryaz sabotaged the best hope of reaching a settlement. The Corellians attacked Tralus, driving the Galactic Alliance forces off it.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> Corellia was blockaded, and in response to terrorist attacks by Corellians on Coruscant, the Galactic Alliance created the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]], a secret police unit under Jacen Solo dedicated to combating terrorism. In protest, Pellaeon resigned, resulting in Admiral [[Cha Niathal]]'s appointment as Supreme Commander.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines]]''</ref> Celchu continued to serve as one of Niathal's staff officers and senior analysts.<ref name=\"Exile\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref><ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nWhen Commenor, joining Corellia's resistance in the new [[Confederation]], exposed the [[Chasin Document]], a plan for the invasion of Commenor by the Galactic Alliance which had been leaked to it, Celchu investigated. He recognized Garm Bel Iblis's tactical hand in the details, found its ship allocation suspiciously lacking in modern classes, and so found that the Chasin Document was in fact genuine&mdash;a thirty-year-old plan for invasion drawn up by Bel Iblis during the Galactic Civil War. It had been only lightly retouched. Celchu looked at the original files and found they had not been accessed by anything other than an automated program to back up data. He had Winter look into the program, and she found the code had been corrupted to send duplicates outside the system by someone using a Galactic Alliance Guard security code. The code had not had opportunity to access much of relevance, and it was quickly removed. Celchu presented his findings to Niathal and her other senior officers.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nWhen Colonel Jacen Solo found evidence that Chief of State Cal Omas had conspired with the Confederation's leadership, he used a new law to arrest Omas. Solo and Niathal became co-chiefs-of-state in the interim.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]''</ref> Full-scale war had meanwhile erupted with the Confederation, and Solo gained more and more power as he became more and more ruthless in dealing with his enemies. Finally, he had the Jedi declared enemies of the state when Luke Skywalker refused to support him any longer and backed out of a military strike.<ref name=\"Inferno\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Inferno]]''</ref> Niathal became concerned about Solo, and ordered Celchu to quietly make contact, behind Solo's back, with Skywalker's Jedi resistance, which was made up mostly of Celchu's old friends. Celchu, growingly worried for Syal Antilles, went to see her on the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']], Jacen Solo's flagship, to see if she could contact her father, who had resigned from the Corellian side and joined with Skywalker. He took his personal shuttle, ''[[Reveille]]'', to the ''Anakin Solo'' himself, where she happily greeted him. She told him that she had been promoted to captain, and on a sadder note told him that [[Tiom Rordan|her fianc\u00e9e]] had died in the [[Second Galactic Civil War|war]]. He shared his sympathies, and asked her for an honest evaluation of morale and of Solo. Her opinions were negative, and he offered her a way out, telling her to watch for orders that would seem distasteful and accept them anyway. He also ordered her to attempt to make contact with Wedge.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nCelchu eventually found that Skywalker's Jedi faction was headquartered on Endor and had Syal Antilles, now assigned as his personal shuttle pilot, take him there. He also picked up [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Toval Seyah]], a Galactic Alliance spy whom Solo had ordered arrested for treason, a charge Celchu knew to be fraudulent. He placed Seyah with Skywalker's group and met with his leadership. As Niathal wished, he asked the Jedi to return to the Galactic Alliance fold. Skywalker refused, but stated that he had faith in Niathal and the Galactic Alliance as a whole, but could not support it so long as Solo was in power. Skywalker did outline his plans, stating that he would lead the Jedi in a strike to destroy Centerpoint Station and deny it to the Confederation as well as rescuing [[Allana Solo|Allana]], the daughter of [[Hapan]] [[Queen Mother]] [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]], whom Solo was holding to pressure Tenel Ka into sending her fleet back into Galactic Alliance service. Skywalker wanted to use Celchu's shuttle to gain access to the ''Anakin Solo'', but Celchu, as much as he disliked Solo and wished Skywalker well, was bound to refuse, as Skywalker was taking action against the Galactic Alliance. Antilles unconvincingly threatened Celchu, giving him enough justification to allow them to use the shuttle, supposedly under duress. Celchu assigned Syal Antilles to serve as Niathal's official envoy to the Jedi faction, to open communications with him whenever she was allowed and create a possible avenue of cooperation.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nCelchu was able to persuade Skywalker to let him fly in Antilles's [[Rakehell Squadron]], which would chase the shuttle aboard the ''Anakin Solo'' and provide support, stating he could accomplish something for Skywalker before he \"escaped\" back to the Galactic Alliance. In fact, he felt duty-bound to attempt to warn the Galactic Alliance. Celchu flew as [[Rakehell Three]], with Syal as his wingmate; his comm unit was restricted to squadron frequency only. When they entered the Corellian system, timed to coincide with Solo's attack on Centerpoint, Celchu helped chase the ''Reveille'' to the ''Anakin Solo'', but used his personal comlink to order Syal not to follow him, as he would break off early. He did so, following extremely close to ''Reveille'' to as to avoid most of the fire directed at him, and making a daredevil landing aboard the ''Anakin Solo'', immediately using his personal comlink to alert the bridge to the fact that there were intruders aboard. While he did what he felt to be his duty, one of the security crew approaching him in his enemy X-wing, started by the attack coming from the ''Reveille'', fired at Celchu, stunning him. He was taken to the ''Anakin Solo''{{'s}} medical bay, where he recovered.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nNot long afterward, Niathal made her split with Solo, revealed as the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, after a long period of escalating tensions and established a splinter [[Alliance-in-exile]].<ref name=\"Revelation\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]''</ref> Celchu remained loyal to Niathal, and the war was soon concluded with a peace that established Niathal's ally [[Natasi Daala]], ex-Imperial warlord and current commander of an irregular force opposing Solo, as Galactic Alliance Chief of State after no other candidate could be agreed upon.<ref name=\"Backlash\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]''</ref><ref name=\"Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref> Niathal withdrew from politics and the military, retiring to Mon Calamari. Celchu did likewise, retiring once more. His reputation remained intact, and he was still widely popular within the military due to his lack of association with Caedus. In [[43 ABY]], about to be charged with dereliction of duty for her role in Jacen Solo's rise to power and reign of terror, Cha Niathal took her own life. The Galactic Alliance held a large state [[Funeral of Cha Niathal|funeral service]] on Coruscant, and Celchu delivered the eulogy for the commander with whom he had worked closely.<ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\n[[44 ABY|The following year]], the Jedi Order [[Plan Delta|overthrew]] Chief of State Daala, believing that her policies and actions were not in the best interests of the Galactic Alliance. In her place, they established a [[Triumvirate (Galactic Alliance)|Triumvirate]] consisting of Jedi Master [[Saba Sebatyne]], Senator [[Haydnat Treen]] and Daala's former Chief of Staff, [[Wynn Dorvan]]. Celchu, along with Carlist Rieekan, attended a meeting of senior government and military figures dealing with former [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] worlds petitioning for membership of the Galactic Alliance. Serving in an advisory capacity, Celchu commented on the petitions of both [[Klatooine/Legends|Klatooine]] and [[Qaras]], and their respective choices as to the individuals to represent them in the Senate.<ref name=\"Ascension\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Even without using the Force, there are some people who have minds so slow that you can almost hear synapses firing at a torpid pace.

As a result, Celchu has also appeared in every ''Star Wars'' novel written by Allston, except ''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]'', in which he is only mentioned, and ''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]'', where he appears in a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]].<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\" /><ref name=\"Iron Fist\" /><ref name=\"Solo Command\" /><ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" /><ref name=\"Rebel Dream\" /><ref name=\"Rebel Stand\" /><ref name=\"Betrayal\" /><ref name=\"Exile\" /><ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Outcast\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref><ref name=\"Backlash\" />\n\nCelchu has been [[retcon]]ned into [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] by Stackpole, who has identified him as the pilot of the second A-wing seen veering off in the attack on the Death Star, and by [[Decipher, Inc.]], which identified him as one of the background pilots seen in the briefing scene<ref name=\"Stackpole FAQ\">[http://www.michaelastackpole.com/?page_id=33 Michael A. Stackpole's online FAQ]</ref><ref name=\"CCG Tycho Celchu\" />, portrayed by [[Terence Mustoo]].<ref name=\"TerenceMustooTycho\">{{Cite_web|url=http://planetdagobah.com/agCTTmua-wingpilot.htm|title=Terence Mustoo-A-Wing Pilot Autograph|publisher=Ryuma|archiveurl=https://archive.vn/pwGsN|archivedate=16-10-2021|nobackup=|nolive=}}</ref> Celchu also appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]'', in which he was voiced by [[Timothy Omundson]].<ref name=\"Rebel Strike\" /> Celchu was voiced by [[Jess Harnell]] in ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast]]'', in which he appeared simply as Rogue Leader.<ref name=\"Jedi Outcast\" />\n\nCelchu's background given in his first appearance, ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition]]'' does not match up with the backstory later established; he is mentioned as being in the Alderaanian Navy, being engaged to a woman named Mia, and speaking to her when the Death Star destroyed Alderaan. Later sources established that Celchu was in the Imperial Navy, was engaged to a woman named Nyiestra, and was speaking with his family. The conflict was retconned in ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine]]'' as false information contained in his Imperial files and believed by Winter.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" /><ref name=\"Battleground: Tatooine\" />\n\nCelchu's hair color is a matter of some confusion. Though Stackpole consistently identifies his hair as light brown in his novels, the early ''X-wing Rogue Squadron'' comics showed Celchu with bright blond hair.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /><ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\" /> This was likely the result of poor communication with the creative team behind the comics, as Celchu's hair was shaded a darker blond in later issues and, in those issues Stackpole scripted himself, was colored a distinct light brown.<ref name=\"Handbook\" /><ref name=\"Requiem for a Rogue\" /><ref name=\"In the Empire's Service\" /><ref name=\"Masquerade\" /><ref name=\"Mandatory Retirement\" /> Allston, apparently working off the comic description, has described Celchu's hair as blond and simply as fair, but never as light brown.<ref name=\"Starfighters of Adumar\" /><ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> His hair has also been shown blond in other sources, but has only appeared as brown in ''Rebel Strike'', in which it was a very dark brown.<ref name=\"Union\" /><ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /><ref name=\"Rebel Strike\" /> While no canonical reconciliation has been made, it is possible that Celchu's hair was simply of an intermediate shade capable of being described and depicted both as light brown and blond, or that he dyed his hair.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*''[[Star Wars Missions 18: Rogue Squadron to the Rescue]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)|''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'']] {{C|Possible indirect appearance}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{C|Appeared in comm window}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] {{C|Possible indirect appearance}}\n*''[[Star Wars Manga: The Empire Strikes Back 1]]'' {{C|Snowspeeder only}} {{Ret}}\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (comics)|''Shadows of the Empire'' comic]] {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (novel)|''Shadows of the Empire'' novel]] {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{Ret}}\n*[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (junior novelization)|''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]] {{C|A-wing only}} {{Ret}}\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Leader]]''\n*''[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron Special]]'' {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Phantom Affair]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Warrior Princess]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Requiem for a Rogue]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: In the Empire's Service]]''\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Masquerade]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''\n*''[[Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]''\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*[[Heir to the Empire (comics)|''Heir to the Empire'' comic]] {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising (comics)|''Dark Force Rising'' comic]] {{C|Indirect appearance}}\n*''[[The Last Command]]''\n*[[The Last Command (comics)|''The Last Command'' comic]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Crimson Empire]]''\n*[[Crimson Empire (audio)|''Crimson Empire'' audio dramatization]]\n*''[[I, Jedi]]''\n*''[[N.R.I.
