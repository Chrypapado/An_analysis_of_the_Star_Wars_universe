In a firefight with [[Jabiimi Nationalists]], he found himself fighting alongside Luke and [[Nolan Gillmunn]], the leader of the [[Jabiimi Loyalists]]. Trigg blamed the attack on Luke, but led the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] to a service lift and escape from the enemy. However, Trigg realized that the lift would not carry them away from the oncoming [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] and decided to continue the fight to allow his commander to escape. Luke thanked Trigg before the lift carried them away, but Trigg's final words were, \"I'm not doing this for you\". Trigg died fighting stormtroopers, buying Luke and Nolan the necessary time to escape.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Empire 30|''Empire'' 30]] {{1st}}\n*[[Empire 32|''Empire'' 32]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Trigg\n|nl=Trigg\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jabiimi]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
