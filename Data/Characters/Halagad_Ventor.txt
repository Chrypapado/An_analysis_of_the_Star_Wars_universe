Have I suffered all these years for a sin not so dark as I believed?|Halagad Ventor|Domain of Evil}}\n'''Halagad Ventor''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who was trained at an unusually late age, due to the fact that he was passed over for training initially during his childhood on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Everen Ettene]] eventually agreed to take him as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] at the [[Almas Academy]]. Since the nature of his training was unnatural, Ventor's actions as a Jedi were considered unorthodox, and he neglected the more subtle aspects of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. These shortcomings may have contributed to his botched peace talks in the [[Virgillian Civil War]], where he and his team were erroneously reported dead during the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]].\n\nVentor served as a [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and was a recipient of the [[Medallion of Honor]]. Under the leadership of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], he helped liberate the planet [[Skye/Legends|Skye]] from [[Zeta Magnus]], a genetic terrorist, during which time he engaged in a [[Concordance of Fealty]] with [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]. Later in the [[Outer Rim Sieges/Legends|Outer Rim Sieges]], Ventor commanded a team which included [[Sha Koon]] assisting to purge the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] from the planet [[Bal'demnic]]. Surviving [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], Ventor teamed up with Jedi Master [[Ashka Boda]] to establish a network of fellow surviving Jedi. He was soon captured by the new [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and interrogated by former protege, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. Ventor was forced to reveal the secret location of his hidden Jedi network. He eventually escaped Vader and fled to [[Trinta]], where madness and the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] consumed him.\n\nAfter many years, a band of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] scouts crash landed on Trinta and were terrorized by Ventor. After enduring several Force attacks, the Rebels confronted Ventor and drew him out of the dark side. Deceased yet redeemed, Ventor would persist in the Force as a [[Force ghost]], and would guide survivors of his betrayal years after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I'll need to know many things to be a Jedi, and cannot confine myself to but one discipline.|Halagad Ventor|Domain of Evil}}\n[[Reproduction/Legends|Born]] to archivists of the [[Royal Library of Alderaan/Legends|Royal Library of Alderaan]] [[Ean Ventor|Ean]] and [[Zollet Ventor]] in [[47 BBY/Legends|47 BBY]], Halagad Ventor lived on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] as a child. Despite being strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Ventor was passed over for [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] training by the [[Acquisition Division/Legends|Acquisition Division]] at an early age due to some oversight by [[Jedi Watchman/Legends|Jedi Watchman]] [[Jorus C'baoth]]. Nevertheless, he aspired to be a scholar, and studied ancient tomes within the Royal Library where he learned the history of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], and aspired to be one. Inspired by C'baoth's handling of the dispute between [[House of Organa/Legends|House Organa]] and [[House of Antilles|House Antilles]], Ventor began pursuing mastery of a wide range of scholarly and martial skills. Taken under the wing of a young [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]], who would go onto become [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] and [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], Ventor was introduced to a wide range of intellectual stimulation as he passed through adolescence.<ref name=\"swcw\" />\n\nWhile visiting the [[Okonomo Retreat]], Ventor was joined by Bail and [[Tia Organa]] in hunting [[manka cat]]s while his parents enjoyed the vacation at the Retreat c. [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]. While he succeeded in killing a manka, the celebration was cut short when Organa presented him the devastating news of what would come to be known as the [[Okonomo Tragedy]]. During the dinner at the Retreat, [[Zeta Magnus|a madman]] had infiltrated the party and infected everyone in attendance with a treacherous [[hive virus]] which caused anthropophagitism in its victims. Shocked and pained at the thought of his parents devouring each other in a bout of mindlessness, Ventor shut himself away and began to teach himself the ways of the Jedi.<ref name=\"swcw\" /> Due to the difficulty of self-teaching, Ventor was unable to truly master any area of Jedi or non-Jedi study. He argued that Jedi should focus on all aspects of the Force, rather than specialize in just one discipline. However, these thoughts were likely born of inexperience.<ref name=\"doe\" /> Accepting comfort from Tia Organa the two engaged in a brief affair and Organa became pregnant with their son [[Nial Organa|Nial]]. Unable to bear the responsibility, Ventor abandoned the Organas and found his way to the [[Cularin system]] where he was excepted into the [[Almas Academy|experimental Jedi academy]] on [[Almas]] in [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]]. At seventeen standard years of age, Ventor was rather old for a Jedi of the era, but trained hard and learned much during his time on the wild planet, confronting such terrors as the [[Wyrd]] cultists, [[dreambeast]]s, [[Dark Lizard]]s, and the [[K'kayeh dragon]].<ref name=\"swcw\" />\n\nAfter spending several short years at the Academy, Ventor began searching for a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] that would train him in the ways of the Jedi. Meeting with Jedi Masters [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]], [[Ashka Boda]], and [[Djinn Altis]], no Master would accept him, citing that he did not have enough control over his mind, anger, fear, and greed. Discouraged, Ventor sought assistance from his old friend, now Senator Organa. Using his connections from the [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention]], Organa arranged a meeting with [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Everen Ettene]] who saw something of herself in the unorthodox Jedi-in-training. Agreeing to train the boy, she nurtured him and castigated him, loving him as a mother should love a child and attempted to reign in his strong personality.<ref name=\"swcw\" /> In spite of Ettene's code-adherent teachings, Ventor persisted with his personal beliefs, and failed to reach his full potential. Ventor, as an unusual case in the post-[[Ruusan Reformation|Ruusan]] Jedi, found it difficult to flourish among his Jedi brethren. He quickly became a great warrior under Ettene, but he failed to grasp the more subtle aspects of Jedi work, such as diplomacy and healing. In some cases, even, he was completely ignorant of these powers.<ref name=\"doe\" />\n\nIn [[27 BBY/Legends|27 BBY]], Ventor and his master were assigned to investigate the ruinous [[Outbound Flight Project]] by the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. Leading an aggressive inquiry into the project's failing, the pair were brought into conflict with Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]; the flight's sole survivors. After a caustic interaction, Ventor eventually met with Padawan Skywalker and the two became close. In Skywalker, Ventor saw himself, sharing the bond of having both entered the Order at a later age then the norm. In Ventor, Skywalker saw the characteristics of both of his lost friends, Padawans [[Tru Veld/Legends|Tru Veld]] and [[Ferus Olin]]. The two shared secrets, with Ventor divulging the memories of his tryst with Organa and the birth of his son, while Skywalker confessed his love for [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]].<ref name=\"swcw\" /> During the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]], Ventor and Ettene were paired with [[Ludwin Katarkus]] and [[Danyawarra]], and dispatched by the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] to the [[Virgillia system/Legends|Virgillia system]], in order to establish peace talks in the [[Virgillian Civil War]]. Upon arriving in the system late in the year [[23 BBY/Legends|23 BBY]], their transport was attacked by dissenters, and destroyed. He, along with his master and the two other Jedi were presumed dead back at [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], and a [[Jedi funeral/Legends|Jedi funeral]] was held for the four of them.<ref name=\"hnn1\" /> Forgotten in the wake of the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|breakout of war]], Ventor and Danyawarra were actually alive, hiding out in hopes of rescue. Salvation would come three weeks after the crash, when Senator Organa was joined by [[Giles Durane]] and Jedi [[Ashka Boda]] in a rescue mission. Extracting the two Padawans, Boda escorted them back to the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]] where the master encouraged Jedi Knight [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to take on the older student and complete his training.<ref name=\"swcw\" />\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n{{Quote|During what you humans called the \"Clone Wars\", three Jedi Knights saved Skye from destruction. One was Obi-Wan Kenobi; the others, his pupils. In gratitude, we swore eternal friendship and fealty to them.|Aragh|Star Wars Annual (1977) 1}}\nAs the second apprentice of [[Jedi General/Legends|General]] Kenobi, Ventor took up the rank of [[Jedi Commander/Legends|Commander]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] and served alongisde Kenobi's first Padawan, Anakin Skywalker. Continuing to share a strong bond of friendship with Kenobi's other student, the two Padawans were permitted to undergo the Jedi ritual known as the [[Concordance of Fealty]], wherein they both committed each others lightsaber to the other. Having received a [[Medallion of Honor]] from [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] for his efforts on Virgillia 7, Ventor donned full [[Clone trooper armor/Legends|clone trooper armor]] during the early stages of the war, foregoing only the helmet during his missions. Accompanying his master to the planet [[Skye/Legends|Marat V]], Ventor and Skywalker were tasked by Jedi Master [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] with arresting the [[Geneticist/Legends|Master Geneticist]] and madman, [[Zeta Magnus]]. Magnus had staged a single-handed takeover of the planet, cajoling the [[Outland Clans]] to his cause and naming himself [[Magister]] of Skye; all the while releasing a plague upon the other [[S'kytri]] who refused to bow down to his rule. Arriving on the planet, the Jedi were led to the [[City of the Winged People]] by [[Patriarch (Skye)|Patriarch]] [[Klarym\u00e9re]] where they were brought before the [[Supreme Council of the Highland Clans]]. As Kenobi attempted to persuade the Council of their good intentions through a retelling of the Order's [[Chosen One/Legends|Prophecy of the Chosen One]], Ventor drew upon his skills with [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]] to levitate Skywalker through the air and out the window high above the mountain vistas in order to gain their trust.<ref name=\"swcw\" />\n\n[[File:HalagadSkye.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Ventor during the [[Battle of Skye]]]]\nProving himself both in skill in the Force and competence with a lightsaber, Ventor fought his way past [[Oskan blood eater]]s in the depths of the legendary labyrinths of the [[Entyrmion]] as the Jedi trekked to the slopes of the [[Canaitith Mountain]] where Magnus had erected his [[Kharys' fortress|citadel]]. Losing his [[Padawan braid/Legends|Padawan braid]] during the fighting, Skywalker joked that it was the only way that Ventor would ever receive a promotion to knighthood. Entering the building, the Jedi were deceived by [[Tark Squad|their clones]] and imprisoned within Magnus' laboratory. The Jedi awoke to look on in horror as [[Cloning/Legends|clones]] were being developed from their DNA; Kenobi and Skywalker's clones were already growing in vats while Magnus planned to begin the process with Ventor's recently obtained genetic matter. When [[Kharys]] arrived and freed them, Ventor fled the chamber and followed Magnus to the citadel's hangar where he confronted the [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] mutant as the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Blue-Tark]] began to power up Magnus' [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the ''[[Skyriver Invader]]''. When Magnus attacked, Ventor lost control of his lightsaber, and the mutant managed to pin the Jedi Padawan down, eating off several fingers from Ventor's sword hand. Ventor blacked out as the monster began consuming him, but was saved when Blue-Tark ignited the ''Invader''{{'s}} engines and fried Magnus in the the ionic fire erupting from the ship as it took off. Lunging into Magnus, Ventor [[Sai tok/Legends|cleaved]] his opponent clean in half; killing him. Regain his composure, Ventor returned to the laboratory where his fellow Jedi continued their fight with the traitorous clone troopers. Noting the [[Class-D detonator]] in the clone's hand, Ventor used the Force to detonate it, wiping the clones, a part of the lab, and the cloned child versions of Skywalker and Kenobi from existence. As the Jedi regrouped outside the citadel, Kenobi noted that Ventor's eye's were bloodshot; recognizing that as a sign of drawing upon the dark side of the Force. Ventor, exhausted from the battle, gave into his frustration as Skywalker turned against him and the pair argued with each other before Ventor tossed the lightsaber he was using back at its rightful owner and telekinetically grabbing his own lightsaber from Skywalker's belt and igniting it. In retaliation, Skywalker ignited his own and Kenobi's to block against Ventor's attack. Before the situation got too far out of hand, Kenobi used the Force to slam Skywalker to the ground, and demanded that the two Padawans hand over their lightsabers. Ventor disengaged and turned over his weapon to the General before storming off to the nearest Republic gunship.<ref name=\"swcw\" />\n\nVentor eventually earned the rank of Knight and was promoted to General himself, ending his collaboration with Kenobi.<ref name=\"doe\" /> As the war reached its waning months, the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] launched [[Operation Durge's Lance]], affecting worlds from the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] to the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]]. General Ventor, along with several other Jedi Knights including [[Sha Koon]], were sent to the Outer Rim planet [[Bal'demnic]] to halt the CIS advance. Intercepted CIS transmissions indicated that the [[Commerce Guild/Legends|Commerce Guild]] was planning to mine [[Cortosis/Legends|cortosis]] from the planet.<ref name=\"papadam\">{{DB|location|baldemnic|Bal'demnic|archivedate=20110826223000}}</ref> Cortosis, being resistant to lightsabers, was known to be a great asset in anti-Jedi warfare, and it had been used by [[Wat Tambor/Legends|Wat Tambor]] in the early stages of the war,<ref name=\"nda\">''[[Star Wars: The New Droid Army]]''</ref> so Jedi Master [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] considered Bal'demnic a high priority.<ref name=\"papadam\" /> What greeted Ventor and Koon's forces on the island planet was an extraordinary sight. The [[Kon'me]] natives had risen up against the Commerce Guild's tyranny, and launched their own revolution against the droid armies. The Kon'me utilized weapons smuggled in by war profiteers, allowing them to fight on equal terms with the droids. Unfortunately for Ventor and Koon, it allowed them to also fight on equal terms with the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Republic]]. Soon after Ventor's Republic forces touched down on Bal'demnic, the Kon'me started firing on them, treating all outsiders as hostiles. With no intention of retaliating against the natives, Ventor and Koon were forced to call a retreat. However, the Confederacy forces were also driven away, so the mission was at least a partial success. Ventor ordered a small portion of his fleet to remain in Bal'demnic's orbit, to prevent further CIS intrusions.<ref name=\"papadam\" />\n\n===Order 66===\n{{Quote|Halagad, old friend.

As Ventor gave in to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], he revealed the names and locations of all the Jedi in his secret network of Order 66 survivors. Satisfied with this information, Vader let him steal a ship, the ''[[Rimrider]]'', to escape the flagship, knowing that the dark side or death itself would surely consume him. Vader did not pursue Ventor though, for he knew that he had already succumbed to the dark side of the Force. After that, Vader then hunted down and slew all the Jedi of Ventor's network he could find.<ref name=\"doe\" /> At least one known Jedi on Ventor's blacklist, Jedi Master [[Qu Rahn]], was able to escape from Vader's hunt.<ref name=\"dfs\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050407b|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 2|int=The Dark Forces Saga|archivedate=20100130004449}}</ref>\n\n===Exile on Trinta===\n{{Quote|I am one with the Dark power.

Bathing in the nexus, his body could not appropriately handle the dark side's power, and so he became deformed and withered, losing all his teeth, weakening his bones, and weathering his face by many years worth, an attribute shared with perhaps many Sith not yet used to the dark side. Fearing retribution from Vader's Imperial forces, Ventor used the dark side of the Force to create illusions of beasts and other creatures, and maintained them all over the planet, in order to ward off any inquisitive souls.<ref name=\"doe\" />\n\nFor approximately 20 years, Trinta and Ventor would go untouched, until a team from the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] crash-landed on the planet. On the run from the [[Taloron]] [[Taloron Hunters|bounty hunter]] [[Crutag]] and his cronies [[Slizzik]] and [[Slimego]], the Rebels sought refuge in Trinta's thick swamps. It was here that they came across one of Ventor's old campsites, and discovered his abandoned [[Medallion of Honor]]. Displeased by the events that had transpired, Ventor used the Force to commandeer the ships of both the Rebels and Crutag, stranding both parties in the swamps. However, he had not thought his plan through to conclusion, as he would not be able to scare them off-planet. Instead, he created illusions of the extinct [[Dradan]] species, and a [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] to intimidate the foreigners. This gambit failed, although Ventor realized that the Rebels might be the key to his redemption from the dark side. However, the fallen Jedi was still fearful of the chance that Vader might find him, so he remained hidden.<ref name=\"doe\" />\n\n===Redemption===\n{{Quote|And I... I am free at last.

He feigned an attempt at converting the Rebels to the dark side, in the hopes that they would kill him and free him from his tortured existence. Instead, the Rebels showed Ventor his Medallion of Honor, reminding him of his service during the Clone Wars; the good deeds he had done, the lives he had saved. The Rebels also informed him that not all Jedi had fallen victim to Vader's blade during the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]], and that some of them still lived on like [[Rahm Kota]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi Wan Kenobi]]. Filled with hope for the first time in years, Ventor had finally escaped the grasp of the dark side, and in the process, escaped his worldly existence. Ventor ascended to the higher plane, passing away a redeemed man and becoming a [[Force ghost]]. His spirit thanked the Rebels, before vanishing.<ref name=\"doe\" /> The rebels then escaped from Trinta with their ships intact, leaving the bounty hunters stranded there for some period of time.\n\nYears later, following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|collapse of the Galactic Empire]] and deaths of Palpatine and Vader, Jedi Master Qu Rahn, the last survivor of Halagad's network and of the few Jedi who aided the Rebel Alliance, fought a quick but deadly battle on the bridge of the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Vengeance (Vengeance-class)|''Vengeance'']] against [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]] [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]] and the [[Seven Dark Jedi]]. Though he was able to mortally wound [[Maw (Dark Jedi)|Maw]], he was overcome by Jerec.

Due to the fact that he was passed over for training at an early age, it is probable that he sought to show the Order wrong. However, with a lack of guidance, Ventor did not cover the Force as a Jedi should, and so, in terms of standardized Jedi training, his skills were flawed. Lord Vader described Ventor as a \"loud man\", who craved accolades and recognition. This was reflected in the fact that Ventor was decorated in the Clone Wars with the Medallion of Honor, an award rarely bestowed.<ref name=\"doe\" />\n\nVentor's insistence on his ways caused him to be knocked back by the Order on several occasions, but it also allowed him to eventually be accepted, despite his unorthodox nature. This nature made him a prime target for Lord Vader in the early stages of the Great Jedi Purge, since Ventor was known to be unstable and \"difficult\". Ventor's flaws plagued him on Trinta as well, but he was not so far gone that he did not realize the error of his ways.<ref name=\"doe\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|So what does it feel like to be a Star Wars character?

In this adventure, the roleplayers - Rebel scouts - encounter Ventor as a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] and endure his wrath, and their ultimate victory is achieved only through redeeming Ventor and bringing him back to the light.\n\n''Domain of Evil'' identified Ventor as the Jedi who betrayed all the survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]] bar Obi-Wan and Yoda, but this hand in the Jedi's downfall was greatly diminished after the character went untouched for many years. [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] material, especially those based around the [[Prequel trilogy]], revealed that a number of other Jedi survived the Purge, while many others died seemingly without the involvement of Ventor or his information.\n\n[[Pablo Hidalgo]] and [[Paul Ens]] revived the character over a decade later in an online [[HoloNet News (original website)|''HoloNet News'']] story, in a mission during the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]]. Halagad's reported death in the article caused confusion amongst fans, until Pablo Hidalgo later revealed that the report was a deliberate red herring. Pablo intended the article to plant the seeds of doubt in any government or private news source claiming that any Jedi had died.<ref name=\"Pablo's blog comment\">[http://blogs.starwars.com/abelgpena/22/comments A comment by Pablo Hidalgo on Abel G.

Pe\u00f1a]] - who goes by the internet alias of \"Halagad_Ventor,\" or \"Halagad\" - always held a keen interest in the character, so much so that artist [[Joe Corroney]] used Pe\u00f1a as a basis for his illustration of Ventor in ''[[Republic HoloNet News Special Inaugural Edition 16:5:241]]''. Pe\u00f1a's interest in the character has also been reflected in his own work; ''[[The Dark Forces Saga]]'', ''[[Aliens in the Empire]]'', and ''[[Echoes of the Jedi]]''.\n\n''Domain of Evil'' mentions Ventor serving under Obi-Wan Kenobi during the Clone Wars. ''[[What's The Story?]]'' writer [[Arthur Papadam]] included Ventor in his [[Databank (original)|Databank]] entry for [[Bal'demnic]], marking the first chronicle of Ventor's specific involvement in the Clone Wars.\n\n[[File:Halagadventorjustin.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[2009 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 4]]'' sketch card by [[Justin Chung]]]]\nAuthor Abel G. Pe\u00f1a had long stated his desire to involve Ventor in Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker's mission on [[Skye/Legends|Skye]], an event mentioned in [[Star Wars Annual (1977) 1|''Star Wars Annual'' (1977) 1]].<ref name=\"Pe\u00f1a interview\">[http://www.galacticsenate.com/showthread.php?t=10694&page=3 Interview with Abel G. Pe\u00f1a on The Galactic Senate]</ref> Pe\u00f1a was able to finally realize this dream in Part 2 of the online supplement ''[[Aliens in the Empire]]''. Ventor's role in this battle served two purposes; to show Ventor serving under Kenobi as mentioned in ''Domain of Evil'', and to create a [[retcon]] fixing an error caused by a pre&ndash;''Empire Strikes Back'' source that represented Anakin Skywalker and the father of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] as two separate individuals in the same place at the same time.\n\nIn ''[[Echoes of the Jedi]]'', Abel G. Pe\u00f1a established that the information Ventor surrendered to Darth Vader regarded only the Jedi survivors of [[Almas Academy]]'s destruction, rather than the survivors of the entire Purge. This retcon allows the story established in ''Domain on Evil'' to maintain some element of truth, while also explaining why Ventor's forced betrayal of the Jedi was largely ignored by other Star Wars sources.\n\n[[Justin Chung]], artist and friend of Abel G. Pe\u00f1a, illustrated Halagad Ventor on a sketch card that was part of the ''[[2009 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 4]]'' trading card set.\n\nHalagad seems to be named after \"[[Wikipedia:Galahad|Galahad]],\" one of the most famous of [[Wikipedia:King Arthur|King Arthur's]] [[Wikipedia:Knights of the Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]].<ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|abelgpena|4|By the Emperor's Black Bones!
