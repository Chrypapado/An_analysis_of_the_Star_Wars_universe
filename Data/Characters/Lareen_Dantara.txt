As a reward for the adventurer's services, Dantara gave the adventurer access to the retreat to take a look around.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLareen Dantara was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment's]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].
