However, Morwan's plans backfired once the Solos interfered with their operations. Seeing nowhere else to go, she boarded the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] with the Solos and their droid, [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], whom she found quite annoying. After fixing [[Han Solo/Legends|Han's]] arm, Morwan attempted to force the Solos into the battle between [[Galney (Ducha of Terephon)|Ducha Galney]] of [[Terephon]] and the Heritage Council and the [[Hapan Royal Navy]] fleet still loyal to Tenel Ka by threatening to shoot Han if [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] did not return to the battle. However, her plan failed when Han disarmed her, breaking her nose.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lalu Morwan\n|es=Lalu Morwan\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morwan, Lalu}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hapans]]\n[[Category:Healers and doctors]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
