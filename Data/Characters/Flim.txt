In this capacity, he&mdash;under the directions of Disra and fellow [[Sinister Triumvirate|triumvirate]] member [[Grodin Tierce (clone)|Grodin Tierce]]&mdash;successfully convinced several officials within the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Starfleet]] to follow his authority in a plan to cause a civil war within the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. While Flim pretended to be the Grand Admiral, Tierce was the military man who came up with the battle plans.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|The whole trick behind being a good con man is convincing the target you know more than you really do.|Flim|Vision of the Future}}\nThe plan called for the exploitation of the [[Caamas Document Crisis]] in which Imperial agents spread rumors that the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothans]] were guilty of the massacre on Caamas many decades prior. Though some Bothans were to blame for the Caamas incident, the rumors spread made certain that all facts were exaggerated, which prompted a military stand-down between factions within the New Republic in orbit over [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]].\n\nFlim spent hours studying Thrawn's history to learn all he could to keep the scheme intact. Even Captain [[Dorja]] of the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Relentless (Dorja)|''Relentless'']], an officer who had served under Thrawn's command, was convinced it was really Thrawn. Shortly after allying himself with Disra and Tierce, Flim revealed himself to [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] and [[Diamal]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Porolo Miatamia]]. After this was revealed to the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|Senate]], turmoil ensued. Many did not believe the reports, although some, such as [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and his wife, [[High Councilor]] [[Leia Organa Solo]] believed it all too well. Few Imperials were told that Thrawn had \"returned\". When [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]] heard of these rumors, he was unsure if they were true, as he had been present when [[Rukh/Legends|Rukh]] had killed his mentor a decade before. Believing that Thrawn was indeed back several star systems began to join the Imperial Remnant, the first of which was the [[Unified Factions]]. Disra's plot was working, and he believed that soon the New Republic would collapse and the Empire would rise. Eventually though, the plan unraveled.\n\nSupreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon, on a visit to [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] to accuse Moff Disra of [[Treason/Legends|treason]] along with other crimes against the Empire, discovered a set of datacards in the Moff's desk when left alone in his office. He decrypted these and later met with [[Talon Karrde]], who gave him a datacard that he had been given by [[Jorj Car'das]]. Along with the ones he took from Disra, they revealed the truth about Flim and Tierce. On Karrde's ship, the ''[[Wild Karrde]]'', he traveled to confront Flim, Disra and Tierce at [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]], where they were battling the ''[[Errant Venture]]''. Pellaeon revealed that Flim was an impostor, that Tierce was a clone, and that Disra was indeed guilty of many crimes, including plotting to overthow the Supreme Commander and funneling of money to suit his own purposes. Tierce was killed, and Flim surrendered both himself and his \"command\" without a fight&mdash;indeed, he expressed relief that the affair was over.\n\nFlim was not a [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] like Thrawn, but a [[Human/Legends|Human]] or very similar [[Near-Human]] who disguised himself using blue makeup, hair dye, and glowing red contact lenses. He demonstrated to Major Tierce and Moff Disra his ability to quickly remove these lenses during a meeting on Yaga Minor.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]''\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*{{GamerCite|7|Red Sky, Blue Flame}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|under \"Gilad Pellaeon\"}} {{Imo}}\n*{{FFCite|102|CAA1-2, ''Caamas Document''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galaxy at War]]''\n*{{DB|character|elegosakla|A'Kla, Elegos|archivedate=20100330032545}} {{Imo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Flim\n|ja=\u30d5\u30ea\u30e0\n|ru=\u0424\u043b\u0438\u043c\n|fi=Flim\n}}\n\n[[Category:Actors]]\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial agents]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
