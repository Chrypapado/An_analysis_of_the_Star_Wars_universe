As the Imperial presence on [[Tasariq]] grew, Yasinda made more and more anti-Imperial remarks during her parties, and even openly questioned the wisdom of the [[Tarkin Doctrine/Legends|Tarkin Doctrine]]. However, few realized that Yasinda was actually an [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] agent who had been recruited by [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] himself for special training. It was planned that she would one day become one of the [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hands]], as Yasinda was found to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], but her Imperial upbringing made her refuse to accept the possibility that the Force even existed, let alone was accessible to her. She was removed from the training, but continued her education with the Intelligence agency, and eagerly spent her time on Tasariq searching for [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] cells.\n\nThe Emperor was curious as to the impact of the native tasar crystals on Force-sensitives, and sent [[Sarcev Quest]] to observe the effect on Bardak. To this end, Quest gave her an amulet containing a tasar crystal, and continued to visit her. Unfortunately for Yasinda, her proximity to the Tasar Crystals re-awakened her Force-sensitivity, and she started to hear voices in her head. This slowly drove her insane, and only her years of training kept her from completely losing her mind. The Emperor refused her transfer requests until his \"experiment\" was completed.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|15|Tasariq: The Crystal Planet}} {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bardak, Yasinda}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Intelligence personnel of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
