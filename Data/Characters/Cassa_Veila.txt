Both individuals were strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] though they were never trained since the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] had been virtually wiped out by then.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[16 ABY/Legends|16 ABY]], she and Tryst befriended an injured [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raider]] named [[Sliven]]. They became friends quickly despite the hosility between the settlers and the Tusken Raiders. Sliven would help her with chores after he recovered and play with her daughter Tahiri. However, she and Tryst were killed by Sliven's tribe who mistook them for enemies.\n\nOut of pity and in return for the kindness shown to him by them, Sliven adopted a then three-year-old Tahiri and raised her as a Tusken Raider until she turned nine in [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], when she was discovered to be Force-sensitive by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Tionne Solusar]] during a trip to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. She would only learn about it during a return trip to Tatooine from the [[Jedi Praxeum]] in 22 ABY.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Promises]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Anakin's Quest]]'' {{Vision|[[Tahiri Veila]]}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Vader's Fortress]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Junior Jedi Knights: Kenobi's Blade]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Cassa Veila\n}}\n\n[[Category:Farmers|Veila, Cassa]]\n[[Category:Females|Veila, Cassa]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives|Veila, Cassa]]\n[[Category:Humans|Veila, Cassa]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians|Veila, Cassa]]"}}}]}}}}
