The adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' later noted that by the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the events portrayed within that module, a year had elapsed since the reemergence of Cularin, thus dating the adventure and subsequent ''Living Force'' modules to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]]. As ''[[Decision: Almas]]'' states that Rast'tul was in his mid-forties by the time of the setting of that adventure, it can therefore be deduced that he was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] at some point between circa [[50 BBY/Legends|50 BBY]] and circa [[60 BBY/Legends|60 BBY]].</ref>\n|death=\n|species=[[Human/Legends|Human]]<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\">''[[Decision: Almas]]''</ref>\n|gender=[[Gender/Legends|Male]]<ref name=\"Night's Promise\">''[[Night's Promise]]''</ref>\n|height=\n|mass=\n|hair=\n|eyes=\n|skin=\n|cyber=\n|affiliation=*[[Thaereian military]]<ref name=\"Night's Promise\" />\n*[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n**[[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]]<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n***[[Strike Force Cularin]]<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n|masters=\n|apprentices=}}\n{{Quote|I thank the fates that I have the opportunity to have such fine people as yourselves serve under me.

Around [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]], during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Rast'tul masterminded a plot to kidnap [[Night Forael Wren|Night Wren]], the [[Youngling/Legends|daughter]] of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren|Lavina Wren]] of the [[Cularin system]], so as to blackmail the senator into supporting Thaereian interests. The child was taken to live with Rast'tul in [[Rast'tul's house|his residence]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Thaere Privo]], and he attempted to manipulate her into becoming a loyal Thaereian servant. However, over [[20 BBY/Legends|one year]] after Rast'tul's abduction of Wren, the child was rescued by the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a band of freelance agents from the [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] [[Star system/Legends|system]].\n\nThe colonel was later assigned to serve in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] at the head of a Thaereian [[Army/Legends|military]] delegation that formed part of the [[Flotilla/Legends|flotilla]] [[Strike Force Cularin]], alongside Republic regulars and forces from the anti-Thaereian [[Cularin Militia]]. Rast'tul was appointed as the second-in-command of the [[Task force/Legends|task group's]] ground forces. For its inaugural mission, Strike Force Cularin was assigned to [[Mission to the Ando system|attack]] a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] [[Separatist Ando system base|base]] in the [[Ando system/Legends|Ando system]]. During the raid, Rast'tul masterminded an attempt to [[Death/Legends|take]] the lives of the Heroes of Cularin, who had accompanied the flotilla as part of the Cularin Militia detachment. After he was later wounded in combat and rescued by the agents while under fire from Separatist forces, Rast'tul inadvertently confessed to being behind the kidnap of Night Wren and the attack on the freelancers. He was subsequently arrested and placed on trial for his crimes.\n\n==Biography==\n===To kidnap a senator's daughter===\n{{Quote|I know you have my little girl and I can't risk her safety, so I am calling off the ships.

Shortly after the system's reappearance, Ras'tul became involved in a plot to blackmail [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren|Lavina Wren]], the [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] system's representative in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], to force her to support pro-Thaereian policies. Rast'tul schemed to kidnap Wren's seven-year-old [[Youngling/Legends|daughter]], [[Night Forael Wren|Night]], and to use the child as leverage against the senator, and he had his [[Spy/Legends|spies]] monitor Wren's activities. Once he had obtained details of Wren's daily routine, the colonel arranged for the vehicle in which Wren traveled to [[school]] to be attacked, then sent in his men to apprehend her under the guise of staging a rescue.<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" />\n\nWren was transported to Thaere Privo, and Ras'tul held her within his personal quarters, as a guest. Rast'tul lied to to the child and told her that her [[Parent/Legends|parents]] had sent her to live with him because she was in danger. Using the attack on Night's vehicle and her mother's recent increase in workload as a result of the war to back up his claims, Rast'tul convinced the child of his sincerity, and she grew fond of him, referring to him as \"Uncle Colonel.\" He also arranged for Wren to be educated by a home tutor alongside a few carefully selected playmates, and he hired the teenage babysitter [[Nannat]] to care for her. He took Wren on trips to amusement parks and to attend various cultural events, and he tried to manipulate her into believing that her parents did not love her, hoping that he could turn her into a loyal Thaereian servant. Despite his efforts to persuade Wren that he cared for her, Rast'tul felt nothing for the child, and he told Lavina Wren that he would [[Death/Legends|kill]] Night if the senator did not do as the Thaereians wished. The senator complied and did nothing to oppose the Thaereians as they took an increasingly heavy-handed approach to security in the Cularin system and became engaged in a [[Thaereian War|conflict]] with the loyalist [[Cularin Militia]].<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" />\n\nSeveral [[Standard month/Legends|months]] later, the Thaereian military ordered Rast'tul to assemble two [[Task force/Legends|task forces]] for special assignments in the Cularin system; the task forces were organized with the aim of creating unrest in order to provide the Thaereians with justification to increase their military presence in the system and tighten their control over Cularin. [[Task Force Pest]], under the command of [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Dalin]], was ordered to round up and incarcerate all [[Force Adept]]s and non-[[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Force-sensitive/Legends|users]] in the Cularin system,<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" /> while Rast'tul commanded [[Task Force Vermin]] to abduct children from the streets of Cularin, who were then coerced and brainwashed into serving Thaereian interests.<ref name=\"Night's Friend\">''[[Night's Friend]]''</ref> However, the efforts of Task Force Pest were thwarted after the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a band of freelance agents who were active in the Cularin system, freed the captured Force Adepts,<ref name=\"Night's Promise\" /> and the actions of Task Force Vermin were also unveiled by the agents and made public.<ref name=\"Night's Friend\" />\n\n[[20 BBY/Legends|Over a year]] after Night's abduction by Rast'tul, Lavina Wren hired the Heroes of Cularin to rescue her daughter from the colonel's clutches. The agents traveled to Thaere Privo and broke into Rast'tul's residence while he was away, where they convinced Wren to leave with them. They then fled the world with the child aboard their [[Starship/Legends|starship]], and Night stole Rast'tul's lockbox from his office and took it with her. Thaereian [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] set out in pursuit of the agents, but, not wanting to risk the child's life, Rast'tul recalled the fighters. He contacted the agents over their ship's communications system, and, in an attempt to maintain some influence over Wren, he appealed to her to remember that he would always be there for her. The child was returned safely to her mother, and Lavina Wren changed her [[Politics/Legends|political]] stance and publicly opposed the Thaereian presence in the Cularin system.<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" /> As a consequence of his failure to continue to hold Night Wren captive, Rast'tul's chances of further advancement within the ranks of the Thaereian military were dashed.<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n\n===Service with Strike Force Cularin===\n{{Quote|Good work, men; I thought that we were goners for&mdash; No. No. Not you. Wasn't ruining my chances for advancement enough? Why did you save me?|Colonel Rast'tul, after the Heroes of Cularin saved his life|Decision: Almas}}\nThe Thaereian military maintained covert ties with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, but as the Clone Wars raged on, the Thaereians came to the conclusion that the Separatists were going to lose the war, so they decided to strengthen their ties to the Republic. To that end, Colonel Rast'tul was assigned to command a Thaereian military volunteer unit that was assigned to serve in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] as part of [[Strike Force Cularin]], a combined task force formed from Thaereian forces, [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic regular forces]], and the Cularin Militia. Lavina Wren suspected that Rast'tul was specially chosen for the posting by [[Jir Tramsig]], the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] of Thaereian forces in the Cularin system, and that the colonel planned to exploit the arrangement to create tension between the Republic and the Cularin Militia, so as to secure Republic backing for the Thaereians' Cularin franchise. Strike Force Cularin was placed under the leadership of the [[Republic officer/Legends|Republic officer]] Colonel [[Lazlo Ardine]], and Rast'tul was appointed to serve directly under Ardine, as the second-in-command of the task group's ground forces.<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n\nFor its opening mission, Strike Force Cularin was tasked with [[Mission to the Ando system|assaulting]] a [[Separatist Ando system base|Separatist base]] situated on a [[Unidentified Ando system planetoid|planetoid]] in the [[Ando system/Legends|Ando system]]. The task force assembled in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] over the planet Cularin, and, while preparations were being made for the upcoming engagement, Rast'tul sent a transmission to the Heroes of Cularin, who had joined the unit as part of the Cularin Militia contingent, in which he told them that he had not forgotten their previous encounter and warned them against interfering with the Thaereians' plans. Soon afterward, the [[Flotilla/Legends|flotilla]] moved out in the direction of the [[Cularin comet cloud]], to leave the system. The Heroes of Cularin departed in their vessel in advance of the main [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] but ran afoul of Thaereian customs forces, which, believing them to be criminals, harried the agents and sent out starfighters after them. The task force arrived moments later to find its route out of the system blocked, and [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Meeba (Republic Navy)|Meeba]], the commander of the Republic [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]] [[Relentless (cruiser)|''Relentless'']] and the leader of the task group's [[Realspace/Legends|space]] forces, challenged Rast'tul to explain the Thaereians' actions. In an attempt to save face, Rast'tul contacted Lieutenant [[Marko (Human)|Marko]], the officer in charge of the customs forces, and berated him before relieving him of his command. The flotilla then resumed its course out of the Cularin system and entered [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]].<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n\nOn arrival in the Ando system, the task force encountered a [[Unidentified Separatist CR90 corvette|Separatist corvette]], and, after a brief [[Space warfare|exchange of fire]], the vessel was disabled. A [[Gura Tran|Thaereian envoy]] had been traveling aboard the Separatist ship as a passenger, and, when the Heroes of Cularin were subsequently assigned to board the wrecked vessel, Rast'tul secretly arranged for them to fall under attack from a Thaereian [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]], in an attempt to prevent evidence of Thaere's dealings with the Confederacy falling into Republic hands. Purportedly acting as a rearguard for the Republic task force, the Headhunter opened fire on the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]], but the attack failed, and the freelance agents survived the attempt on their lives. On their return to the task force, Colonel Ardine, Captain Meeba, and Rast'tul briefly met with the agents to discuss the attack, and Rast'tul claimed that the Headhunter had gone missing and that Cularin dissidents were behind the strike.<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n\nThe task force progressed onward and [[Ground warfare|commenced]] its assault on the [[Planetoid/Legends|planetoid]] on which the Separatist installation was located. Rast'tul landed on the planetoid and led the task group's ground forces into battle, but he was wounded and became pinned down in a trench by Separatist fire. With no clear route of escape, the colonel was forced to take cover behind the remains of a damaged [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] piece amid the bodies of some of his fallen comrades. However, he was sighted by the CIS forces, and six Separatist [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] were dispatched toward his location to finish him off. At the last moment, the Heroes of Cularin intervened and fended off the [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], thereby saving Rast'tul's life. The colonel began to thank his saviors, but when he looked up and saw that it was the freelance agents that had rescued him, he became outraged, believing that the operatives had humiliated him once again. In his anger, he began a tirade in which he denounced the freelancers and confessed to being responsible for the kidnap of Night Wren and for the attempt on the agents' lives by the Thaereian Headhunter. Rast'tul's confession was overheard by Ardine, who promptly placed Rast'tul under arrest, and the Thaereian colonel was [[Stun/Legends|stunned]] and taken into custody by two [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]]. The raid on the Separatist base was a success for the Republic,<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" /> and Rast'tul was placed on trial in the aftermath of the mission.<ref name=\"Decision: Coruscant\">''[[Decision: Coruscant]]''</ref> The Thaereian military demanded that Rast'tul be returned to Thaere to face punishment, but their entreaty was rejected by Republic [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], who stated that because Rast'tul committed a crime while in the service of the Republic, it was appropriate that he be held under Republic jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I hate you, you smug Cularite scum. Sitting there with the riches of the universe, laughing at those poorer than you. Your Senator so self-righteous in the media, and before the Senate. Well, your precious Senator danced our tune gladly enough when we had her brat, didn't she?|Colonel Rast'tul, to the Heroes of Cularin|Decision: Almas}}\nRast'tul was a skilled and highly capable military officer who progressed quickly through the ranks of the Thaereian military. However, he was also arrogant and had an inability to admit being at fault, leading him to blame any military failures in which he was involved on his underlings or unforeseeable events, which undermined his proficiency as a leader.<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" /> He was duplicitous and greedy,<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" /> and he was willing to arrest innocent beings,<ref name=\"Night's Promise\" /> kidnap children,<ref name=\"Night's Friend\" /> and blackmail Senator Lavina Wren to further his own ends. While he ostensibly acted in the name of the Thaereian military, he sought greater power for himself and tried to use all that he did to further the aims of the Thaereians as a means of his enhancing his own influence on Thaere.<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" />\n\nThe colonel attempted to manipulate Night Wren into becoming a loyal Thaereian servant and portrayed himself to her as a loving uncle. In truth, he had no emotional attachment to the child; he viewed her merely as a bargaining chip whom he was prepared to kill if need be, and he was willing to use her as a means through which to exert control over her mother. Consequently, even after Night had been rescued from Thaere, Rast'tul continued to publicly maintain the pretense that he cared for her, in an attempt to retain some influence over her.<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" /> He hated the Heroes of Cularin for thwarting his efforts to blackmail Lavina Wren and disliked the senator personally, finding her to be overly self-righteous.<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nColonel Rast'tul was created by [[Margaret van Poelgeest-Heintz]] and featured as an antagonist in the [[Night Eyes trilogy]] of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] game, making his first appearance in ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'', the final installment of the trilogy. The adventure advised players to use the [[1991]] film [[Wikipedia:Hook (film)|''Hook'']] as a guide for portraying Rast'tul, comparing his attempted manipulation of Night Wren to efforts of the character [[Wikipedia:Captain Hook|Captain Hook]] in the movie to turn the character [[Wikipedia:Characters of Peter Pan|Jack Banning]] against his family.<ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" />\n\nRast'tul later appeared in the [[2004]] ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Decision: Almas]]'', by van Poelgeest-Heintz's husband, [[Ronald A. Heintz]]. During the adventure, the players [[Roleplaying game|roleplay]] as the Heroes of Cularin. When Rast'tul comes under fire from Separatist troops during the raid on the Separatist base, the player-characters have the option to either intervene and save him or stand back and let him die. If they come to his aid and rescue him, he becomes incensed, and the players can goad him into confessing to his misdemeanors, which Lazlo Ardine then overhears. If the players can only get him to confess to kidnapping Night Wren, he is arrested to be sent for a criminal trial; if he also admits to being behind the attack on the player-characters, he is placed under charges of [[Treason/Legends|treason]] and [[Court-martial/Legends|court-martialed]] by the Republic Military, then put on trial by a civilian court for his role in Wren's abduction.<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" /> The adventure ''[[Decision: Coruscant]]'' subsequently confirmed that in the [[Star Wars Legends|official]] outcome, Rast'tul was placed on trial, but it did not also confirm whether he was court-martialed.<ref name=\"Decision: Coruscant\" />\n\nThe sources are inconsistent as to how the colonel's name is capitalized. In the Night Eyes trilogy, his name is spelled \"Rast'Tul,\"<ref name=\"Night's Promise\" /><ref name=\"Night's Friend\" /><ref name=\"Night's Homecoming\" /> whereas in ''Decsion: Almas'' and ''Decision: Coruscant'', he is referred to as \"Rast'tul.\"<ref name=\"Decision: Almas\" /><ref name=\"Decision: Coruscant\" /> This article uses the latter spelling, because ''Decision: Almas'' and ''Decision: Coruscant'' are the most recent sources in which he is referenced.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Night's Promise]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Night's Friend]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Decision: Almas]]''\n*''[[Decision: Coruscant]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Galactic Republic military officers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Navy of Thaere members]]\n[[Category:Thaereians]]"}}}]}}}}
