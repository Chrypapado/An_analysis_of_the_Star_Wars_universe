Sometime around the year [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Praji joined the newly [[Declaration of a New Order|formed]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Imperial Navy/Legends|navy]] and became an honored graduate of the [[Academy of Carida|Imperial Academy]] on the planet [[Carida/Legends|Carida]]. He participated in various Imperial campaigns, such as the [[Battle of Almak|subjugation of Almak]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Praji led [[Troop/Legends|troops]] against [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] cells in the battles of [[Attack at Datar|Datar]] and [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (Galactic Civil War)|Nar Shaddaa]].

In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], after the Rebels acquired the [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]], the ''Devastator'' chased the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']], Imperial [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa's]] [[Consular ship/Legends|consular ship]], to the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. When the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] was [[Battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|captured and boarded]] over the planet, the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] quickly secured the ship, and Praji hastened to the main [[Computer/Legends|computer]] room to search for the stolen plans.\n\nHowever, the plans were copied into the [[Memory core|memory banks]] of the [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] who, accompanied by his [[Counterpart/Legends|counterpart]], the [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], left the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] in an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] which crash landed on Tatooine. Praji reported to Vader that an escape pod had been jettisoned from the ship during the battle, but that no lifeforms had been detected aboard the pod. Vader ordered Praji to personally search for the plans on the surface of Tatooine, but he took the orders lightly and delegated the mission to his subordinates.
