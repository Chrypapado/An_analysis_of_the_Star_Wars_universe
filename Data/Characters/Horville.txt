In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], it was visited by a group of [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]], who were searching for something more exciting than the [[Tumble bunny|tumble bunnies]] show. Horville was able to convince them to come inside to see his show, after which they all ran out, screaming, as it had been a very frightening affair. The [[Youngling/Legends|young]] Ewoks continued crying about Horville's horrors that afternoon, and he continued to scare one of the Ewoks, [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Warrick]], who had [[Dream/Legends|nightmares]] that night.\n\n==Biography==\n===A scary hut===\n{{Quote|I'm Horville and this is my Hut of Horrors.|Horville|Horville's Hut of Horrors (episode)}}\n[[File:HelloHorville.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Horville presents his Hut of Horrors.]]\nHorville was an [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] individual who ran an attraction known as [[Horville's Hut of Horrors]] on the [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon of Endor]].

After being fed up with the show being boring, they went to the hut in search of something more fun. Horville stepped outside to welcome them, which startled Warrick and caused the rest of the Ewoks to scream. He then commended them for choosing his attraction, calling it the right place for one seeking excitement and horror, and he introduced himself and his hut.<ref name=\"HHoH\" />\n\n===Too scary for woklings===\n{{Quote|Step up, brave Ewoks, and see what's inside.|Horville|Horville's Hut of Horrors (episode)}}\nHorville beckoned the Ewoks to step up even as Kintaka tried to get Warrick to go back to the tumble [[Bunny|bunnies]]. He introduced his exhibitions, which included [[Garth (snake eater)|Garth]] the [[Snake/Legends|snake]] [[Diet/Legends|eater]], the hideous [[Ploob]], and [[Bilbob]] the Mystic, all of whom caused the woklings to scream in terror. Warrick held a vote to decide whether the group would visit the Hut of Horrors or the tumble bunnies. Despite the vote choosing the bunnies, Warrick proclaimed that the hut had won, personally guaranteeing that the woklings would enjoy themselves. Horville showed them the way in as eerie [[Music/Legends|music]] played and chortled as the Ewoks went inside.<ref name=\"HHoH\" />\n\n[[File:Horville1.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Horville waves goodbye.]]\nThey later ran out, screaming as Horville waved goodbye. He asked them to tell their friends about his Hut of Horrors despite their clear displeasure with it. Kintaka had been correct to be skeptical of Warrick's idea, as Horville's show thorougly scared the wokling; they all cried in fright for the rest of the afternoon. That night, all of the woklings had [[Dream/Legends|nightmares]] related to Horville's horrors, but they did not experience them, as a [[Dream sucking device|device]] created by the [[Shaman/Legends|shaman]] [[Logray/Legends|Logray]] sucked the dreams away. However, the [[magic]] device fell over, and all of the dreams instead went to Warrick. In his dream, he was being chased by Horville, who rode a [[Color/Legends|pink]] [[Species/Legends|animal]] whom he told to get the young Ewok. Eventually, he was indeed captured by Horville, but he then woke up.<ref name=\"HHoH\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Goodbye, Ewok.

He payed no attention to the Ewoks' screams after they visited his show, instead asking them to continue to advertise his attraction.
