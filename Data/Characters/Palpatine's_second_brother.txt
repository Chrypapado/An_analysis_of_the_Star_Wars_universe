His eldest brother, known simply as Palpatine, became a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] as [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Sidious, [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], and [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] of the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].\n\n==Biography==\nPalpatine's relationship with his second brother was one of mutual contempt, as was his relationship with all his siblings&mdash;they considered Palpatine an interloper and resented him, and he, in turn, considered them \"well-behaved\" and held them in contempt for not sharing his vast ambition. The younger brothers and the sisters were, however, their father's pride, representing all that Palpatine could never be.\n\nIn [[65 BBY/Legends|65 BBY]], Palpatine's second brother was present along with his family and [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]] when they took Palpatine from [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] in the [[Palpatine family starship|family]] [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]]. After the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] left Chandrila, Palpatine slaughtered everyone inside, including his young brothers.\n\nPalpatine remembered the lifeless forms of his siblings slumped on the starship floor every time his Sith master, [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]], urged him to recall the murders in vivid detail as part of his training in the dark side.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']] {{1st|[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Palpatine family]]\n[[Category:Unidentified brothers]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
