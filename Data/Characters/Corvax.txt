When the latter fell in [[Attack on Mustafar|battle]], she attempted to resurrect him by using the Mustafarians' most sacred artifact, the [[Bright Star]]. Instead, the energies unleashed completely destroyed the surface of Mustafar. However, a [[Corvax descendant|descendant]] of hers destroyed the Bright Star and freed Dorwin, allowing Mustafar to slowly heal.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:BlackBishop-VaderImmortal.jpg|thumb|left|297x297px|Dorwin, the husband of Lady Corvax, after she failed to resurrect him.]]\nLong before the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], [[Lord|Lady]] Corvax and [[Gender|her]] [[Marriage|husband]], [[Dorwin Corvax]], resided on [[Mustafar]], which was then a lush planet thriving with life, and the two spouses lived in harmony with the [[Mustafarian|natives]]. One fateful [[Standard day|day]], however, Mustafar came under attack, and Dorwin [[Death|fell]] in battle, [[sword]] in hand. Struck with grief, the woman stole the most sacred artifact of the Mustafarians, the [[Bright Star]] [[crystal]],<ref name=\"Vader VR 1\" /> to power her [[Aeon Engine]], which she hoped could resurrect her love.<ref name=\"Vader VR 2\">''[[Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series \u2013 Episode II]]''</ref>\n\nThat attempt, however, utterly failed. Not only was Dorwin cursed to be trapped between the real world and what came after,<ref name=\"Vader VR 2\" /> but the powerful energies that burst from the Bright Star [[Devastation of Mustafar|transformed]] the beautiful planet of Mustafar into a hellscape. Following the incident, Lady Corvax kept the artifact hidden in her [[Corvax Fortress|sanctum]], whose key could only be used by one of her descendants.<ref name=\"Vader VR 1\" /> She hoped that one day, a future descendant would be able to recover the Bright Star, bring it back to the Mustafarians, and perhaps repair some of the damage she had done.<ref name=\"Vader VR 2\" /> During the [[Imperial Era]], one of her descendants, [[Corvax descendant|a smuggler]] who was partially aided by Dorwin, destroyed the artifact, freeing Dorwin from his curse and allowing the planet to slowly heal.<ref name=\"Vader Immortal Ep III\">''[[Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series \u2013 Episode III]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series \u2013 Episode I]]'' {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*''[[Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series \u2013 Episode II]]'' {{Voice}}\n*''[[Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series \u2013 Episode III]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Corvax\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043a\u0441\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Mustafar residents]]"}}}]}}}}
