He, along with his friend [[Shasa]] and many other Selkath youth, was taken in by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] in an attempt to subvert the [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]] government. When he indicated his desire to leave the [[Sith Embassy]], he was tortured to [[Death/Legends|death]] by the Sith, who told Shasa and the others that he had returned to [[Ahto City]]. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] found him in his dying moments and took from Galas a pin that one of his fellow apprentices had given him as a child. Revan then gave this pin to Shasa, who recognized it and realized that the Sith were responsible for Galas' death.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Galas\n|es=Galas\n|fi=Galas\n|pl=Galas\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441 (\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430\u0442)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Former Sith]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Selkath]]\n[[Category:Sith minions]]\n[[Category:Sith of Revan's Sith Empire]]\n[[Category:Sith rejects]]"}}}]}}}}
