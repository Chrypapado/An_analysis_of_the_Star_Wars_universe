I don't know much about these political things.|Grodin Tierce|Specter of the Past}}\n'''Grodin Tierce's clone''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]]. A [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] of the [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Royal Guardsman]] [[Grodin Tierce]], he, along with the con artist [[Flim]] and [[Vilim Disra|Moff Disra]], attempted to bring the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] from the brink of defeat and destroy the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins===\n{{Quote|Just a clone? Is that what you said, Disra? I'm not just a clone. I was something very special.|Tierce|Vision of the Future}}\nAt some point after the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], [[Grodin Tierce]] came to serve as a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] officer under [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Chimaera/Legends|''Chimaera'']]. Having impressed Thrawn with his martial skill and physical prowess, Thrawn chose Tierce to act as a template for a new type of [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] two months before the [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|Battle of Bilbringi]] in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]]. Not merely a duplication of another proficient warrior or sleeper agent, Thrawn made use of a technology discovered in [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|Mount Tantiss]] to transfer his own strategic genius to the flash learning matrix. While he had hoped to create a powerful group of warlords that combined stormtrooper strength with his own military brilliance, the Tierce clone proved to be little more than a \"tactically brilliant stormtrooper\", rather than a true leader. The project was canceled. When the original Tierce died in Thrawn's [[Fall of Generis|campaign]] on [[Generis/Legends|Generis]], the clone assumed the identity of its progenitor, the beginning of a development of mental instability. The cloned Tierce personally caught and killed the fleeing [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]] [[Rukh/Legends|Rukh]] after he stabbed Thrawn, killing him and thus stopping the [[Thrawn campaign|major threat]] to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\n===Sinister Triumvirate member===\n{{Quote|Grand Admiral Thrawn sir! Stormtrooper TR-889 reporting for duty!|Tierce|Specter of the Past}}\nBy [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], Tierce had become a [[Major/Legends|Major]] and aide-de-camp of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Vilim Disra]], who was unaware that he was a clone. After Disra revealed that he knew Tierce had been a [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Royal Guard]], he joined into [[Sinister Triumvirate|an alliance]] with him and [[Flim]], a man masquerading as the dead [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]]. Tierce used Disra as a foil and source of resources to execute a Thrawn-style plan to stop [[Supreme Commander (Empire)/Legends|Supreme Commander]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]] and the [[Imperial Remnant]] from surrendering to the New Republic. The soldier hybrid hid modified copies of the [[Caamas Document]] to manage the latter, while Flim and the forces of Disra accounted for the former. He helped spread rumors that Thrawn had returned, bringing turmoil to the New Republic.\n\nIn the end, Tierce's madness was his own undoing. [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]], who was unaware of this plot, was able to uncover the truth of the clone Tierce's origins, reveal Flim as an imposter and settle with the New Republic for a series of peace talks. He revealed to Tierce that he had been a failure and that the project had been canceled because of Tierce's negative qualities. Tierce's clone himself met his death at the hands of [[Shada D'ukal]], [[Talon Karrde]]'s bodyguard, when he attempted to kill Pellaeon.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]''\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[Red Sky, Blue Flame]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 2: Crimson Empire]]'' {{C|Epigraph}}\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*{{FFCite|102|CAA1-2, ''Caamas Document''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Galaxy at War]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Grodin Tierce (Klon)\n|ru=\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0422\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0441 (\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d)\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tierce, Grodin (clone)}}\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Human clones]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Imperial Remnant]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
