Passes very close to that red supergiant.|Gorrm|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi &mdash; The Golden Age of the Sith}}\n'''Gorrm''' was the assistant and chief navigator for [[Ssk Kahorr]], a merchant lord active in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]] in the years leading up to the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]]. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], one of Kahorr's [[Cha'a drone ship|drone ships]], the ''[[Zeta Five]]'', was destroyed on a run to the [[Primus Goluud system|Goluud system]] after taking a route called the [[Goluud Corridor]]. The enraged Kahorr had Gorrm hire [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the two navigators who had plotted the Goluud Corridor, [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] and [[Jori Daragon]]. However, the assassins were fended off by the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]] and [[Memit Nadill]]. The Daragons escaped the [[Star system/Legends|system]], but Jori returned later, proclaiming that she had found the long-lost [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], and that they were planning to attack the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Kahorr took this opportunity to seize Daragon's [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]'', as payment for the destruction of ''Zeta Five''. Kahorr and Gorrm subsequently took the ship for a joyride to test its controls; however, the ship was destroyed by an incoming [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]], resulting in Gorrm's death.\n\n==Biography==\nGorrm, a tall [[Primate/Legends|simian]] [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]], worked as the assistant and chief navigator to merchant lord [[Ssk Kahorr]], who was active in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Koros system]] in the years leading up to the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]]. In [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]], Gorrm launched a [[Cha'a drone ship|drone ship]], the ''[[Zeta Five]]'', to deliver much-needed supplies and provisions to a [[Mining/Legends|mining]] colony on [[Goluud Minor]], in the [[Primus Goluud system|Goluud system]]. The route to be taken was called the [[Goluud Corridor]], and Gorrm, who was responsible for locking in the coordinates and preparing the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] for launch, raised concerns that the Goluud Corridor passed perilously close to the [[Star system/Legends|system's]] red supergiant [[Star/Legends|star]], [[Primus Goluud/Legends|Primus Goluud]]. Kahorr was quick to dismiss these concerns, trusting fully in the [[Hyperspace Navigator's Guild|Navigators' Guild]] safety standards. However, after the ship was launched, Gorrm's fears were confirmed. By the time the ''Zeta Five'' reached the Goluud system, stellar activity in Primus Goluud had entered into a violent phase, and a massive solar flare obliterated the ship and its cargo. An enraged Kahorr had Gorrm hire [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] and send them after the two navigators who had plotted the route, [[Gav Daragon|Gav]] and [[Jori Daragon]]. The two were rescued by a pair of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]] and [[Memit Nadill]], and the Daragons were subsequently able to escape the Koros system in their ship, the ''[[Starbreaker 12]]''.<ref name=\"goldenage\" />\n\nJori Daragon later returned, alone, in the ''Starbreaker 12'', claiming that after their escape, she and her brother had happened upon the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]],<ref name=\"measures\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 1]]</ref> which had been isolated from [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] since the [[Hundred-Year Darkness/Legends|Hundred-Year Darkness]] two-thousand years before.<ref name=\"nec\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Daragon said that the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] were preparing to attack the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and demanded a meeting with the leader of the unified Koros system, [[Teta/Legends|Teta]], to alert her of the threat. However, her pleas fell on deaf ears, and she was arrested for numerous charges related to her escape. Gorrm and Kahorr arrived amongst the crowds surrounding the ''Starbreaker 12'', and Kahorr told the police that were present that the ''Starbreaker 12'' was legally his, as a payment for the destruction of ''Zeta Five''. Kahorr had Gorrm gave the police the pertinent documents, which proved that by a [[Merchants' Guild]] decision, the ''Starbreaker 12'' had indeed been granted to Kahorr.<ref name=\"measures\" /> Kahorr and Gorrm decided to take the ship on a joyride to test its controls, but they were suddenly set upon by a Sith battle [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]]; the Sith had followed the ''Starbreaker 12'' back to the Republic. The Sith attacked them before they could escape, destroying the ''Starbreaker 12'' and [[Death/Legends|killing]] Gorrm.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGorrm served Ssk Kahorr faithfully, but he was not afraid to question Kahorr's decisions, as he raised concerns about Kahorr's choice of the Goluud Corridor as the route on which to send the ''Zeta Five''.<ref name=\"goldenage\" /> Gorrm was also a capable [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], and was Kahorr's choice to fly his ships.<ref name=\"encounter\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Gorrm first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi &mdash; The Golden Age of the Sith]]'', a story arc of the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series written by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and released in [[1996]]. Gorrm would later appear in ''The Golden Age of the Sith''{{'s}} follow-up arc, [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire|''Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire'']], in which he was killed. In these appearances, Gorrm was illustrated by [[Dario Carrasco, Jr.]]. Gorrm later received an entry in the [[2008]] ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Golden Age of the Sith'' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 1]]\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire 3|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Fall of the Sith Empire'' 3]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gorrm\n|ru=\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0440\u043c\n|tr=Gorrm\n}}\n\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Navigators]]\n[[Category:Tetans]]"}}}]}}}}
