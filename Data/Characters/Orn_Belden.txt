He was 164 [[Standard year/Legends|years]] old by the time of the [[Bakura Incident]].\n\n==Biography==\nA member of the [[Belden family]], Orn was presumably one of the original [[Bakur Mining Corporation]] settlers of [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]]. He was described as being tall in terms of both height and courage.\n\nHe married [[Eppie Belden|Eppie Antruse]] in [[97 BBY]], the same year as a droid uprising on Bakura. Sometime afterward, they had their only child, [[Roviden Belden|Roviden]]. Along with his wife and son, Orn sympathized with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], but unlike them, he took no steps to help them.\n\nThus, when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] occupied Bakura in [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], his son was executed and his wife slated to be so; however, he convinced [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Wilek Nereus]] to save her life by giving up his voice box. Nereus still punished Eppie, however, by inserting a senility-creating parasite into her brain.\n\nBy the time of the Imperial occupation of Bakura, he had become Senior Senator, despite the fact that he had two prosthetic hearts and now required a voice amplifier to speak. Of the handful of Bakuran senators who opposed the actions of the Imperial governor, Belden was the most vociferous. Along with [[Prime Minister (Bakura)|Prime Minister]] [[Yeorg Captison]], Belden secretly oversaw the existence of the underground resistance&mdash;although they numbered only ten cells with around ten members each.\n\nIt was the plan to activate these resistance cells against the occupation force during the [[Battle of Bakura]] that got Belden, Captison, and Rebel ambassador [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] arrested. The shock was too much for the elderly Belden, and he died in captivity of an (otherwise easily preventable) cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nThe rebel cells rose anyways, under the leadership of the cured Eppie, and both Organa and Captison&mdash;as well as the planet&mdash;were free from Imperial control.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|6|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{FFCite|23|BAK3, ''The Truce at Bakura''}}\n*{{DB|character|beldens|Belden, Eppie and Orn|archivedate=20100209201056}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Orn Belden\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belden, Orn}}\n[[Category:Bakuran Senators]]\n[[Category:Bakurans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
