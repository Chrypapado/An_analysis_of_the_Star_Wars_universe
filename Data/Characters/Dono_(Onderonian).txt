''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the Rogue One mission to [[0 BBY]]. Therefore, the [[Onderonian]] Civil War began in [[22 BBY]] and ended in [[19 BBY]]. Because the end of the war was depicted in \"[[Tipping Points]],\" the events of the episode must be set in 19 [[Galactic standard calendar|BBY]].

Shortly after one of the rebels pulled off a public demonstration, she reported to their leader, [[Steela Gerrera]], that [[King]] [[Sanjay Rash]] was going to execute the former king, [[Ramsis Dendup]], in the [[Yolahn Square|square]] the following [[Standard day|day]]. Later, she watched as Steela's sister [[Saw Gerrera|Saw]] go on a rogue mission to rescue the king the night before his execution. She witnessed him get captured and reported back to Steela. She and a group of Onderon rebels, including Steela and [[Lux Bonteri]] freed Dendup during his execution as well as Saw. Unknown to Dono and the rebels, [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] [[General]] [[Kalani]] had called for a squad of [[B2-series super battle droid]]s and when Dono led the group of rebels away, the super battle droids arrived and shot her, [[Death|killing]] Dono instantly.
