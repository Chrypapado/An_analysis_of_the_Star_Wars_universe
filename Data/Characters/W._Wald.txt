My boss, Watto, he asked me to do a number of things in addition to my regular daily chores.|Wald, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''W. Wald''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] who owned [[Wald's Parts]] after [[Watto/Legends|Watto]] passed the business to him on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and was a childhood friend of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] when both were [[Youngling/Legends|young]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]]. Wald spoke [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\nWald was a friend of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] in their childhood years. He lived on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] with his family, which had moved to Mos Espa only shortly before the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], and helped Anakin as he built a [[Podracer/Legends|podracer]]. Wald was known as a petty thief and vandal, and graffiti proclaiming [[Watto/Legends|Watto]] to be a \"dirty old bird\" was attributed to him. Wald always managed to share his illicit earnings with his friends, and his friendship with Anakin Skywalker was strong.\n\n===Adult life===\n{{Quote|I'm afraid you will have to talk to Watto if you need something. I have too much to do...yes, far too much to do.|Wald, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nIn the years following Anakin's departure, Wald remained close friends with [[Kitster Chanchani Banai|Kitster Banai]] and Anakin's mother, [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|Shmi]]. He took a job working in [[Wald's Parts|Watto's salvage yard]], but never matched Anakin's skills in repairing old hardware.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\">''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Wald.png|thumb|left|Overburdened, the adult Wald would often stress out.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Wald was often overburdened with jobs in addition to the normal chores while working for Watto. For example, when there was a problem with large [[Mynock/Legends|mynocks]] slipping into Watto's junkyard at night to eat the power cables, Watto told Wald to solve the problem. Fortunately for Wald, a traveler who was looking for a missing droid part agreed to help Wald and went to the location just outside of Mos Espa where the mynocks roamed, thinning out the population drastically. The traveler agreed to do two more jobs for Wald. A gang called the [[Laser Flits]] had ambushed a delivery of [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] parts for one of Wald and Watto's customers and stolen ten swoop parts. The traveler went to the Laser Flits' headquarters and retrieved the parts, killing at least ten gang members. The other job was a simple delivery job. Some spare parts were to be delivered to a [[Qord D'Baelor]] customer waiting in [[Mos Espa Starport]]. Having completed the jobs, the traveler left. Wald appreciated the benevolence of the traveler, whom he ended up considering a friend.<ref name=\"SWG:WW\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Wald's Woes|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\nWhen Watto decided to retire, he turned over the salvage shop's rights to Wald. He renamed the shop [[Wald's Parts]] and continued to do a meager business during the early years of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. When Kitster stole the [[Killik Twilight]] moss-painting, Wald helped him escape from [[Jergo]], then later provided information to [[Leia Organa Solo]] on where Kitster had fled with the moss-painting. Leia, however, was quietly infuriated that he refused to believe Anakin Skywalker had grown up to become Darth Vader, unable in his mind to reconcile the joyous young child he had known with the monster of the Dark Side. He was also unaware of his return to Tatooine and the actions he took in attempting to rescue his mother.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWald was played by [[Warwick Davis]], who also played [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket W. Warrick]] in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']], as well as [[Weazel/Legends|Weazel]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']].\n\nWald appeared in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:WW\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> He was added as part of the quest titled \"[[W:c:swg:Wald's Woes|Wald's Woes]]\" with the release of \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 2|Chapter 2: The Talus Incident]]\", on [[August 1]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|14|Urchins}}\n*''[[Episode I Adventures 5: The Ghostling Children]]''\n*''[[Episode I Adventures 8: Trouble on Tatooine]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Episode I: Anakin Skywalker]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Episode I Journal: Anakin Skywalker]]''\n*''[[Episode I: The Phantom Menace \u00bd]]''\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]''\n*''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary]]''\n*{{CollectorCite|6|Around the Galaxy|Around the Galaxy: Dark Horse Unmasks The Phantom Menace}}\n*{{CollectorCite|6|Use the Force|Use the Force: Episode I Card Quiz}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{1stID}}\n*[[Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide (real-life book)|''Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide'']]\n*{{FFCite|135|''Wald''}}\n*{{YJCCG|set=Boonta Eve Podrace (YJCCG)|link=boontaevepodrace/light/large/6waldanakinsfriend.html|cardname=Wald}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Head-to-Head Tag Teams]]''\n*{{DB|character|wald|Wald|archivedate=20100722123233}}\n*''[[LEGO Star Wars Character Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|131|Things To Look Out For In Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace 3D!}}\n*{{SWE|characters|wald|Wald}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/photoreceptor/2003/08/photoreceptor20030829.html|text=Anyone for Tennis?}}\n*{{SWGWiki|Wald's Woes}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Wald (Rodianer)\n|es=W.
