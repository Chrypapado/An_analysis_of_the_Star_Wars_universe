I have people out tracking Blix, but you seem to have a knack for finding him and his cohorts. Do you think you can find him again?|Windy Starkiller|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAlita Sweetwater was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] individual who lived during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Some time after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction of the first]] [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Alita was shot and killed by [[Blix Lanister]] in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. During [[1 ABY/Legends|1.5 ABY]], [[Windy Starkiller]] resided in Anchorhead. While here, he asked a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to find the wanted murderer, after he fled town.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nThe spacer agreed to carry out the task, and found Blix shortly thereafter. Blix was brought back to Windy, who paid the spacer 30 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] in thanks. He even said the spacer should consider a career as a security officer. Yet the situation with Blix did not end there. Windy also wanted the spacer to find one of Blix's gang members, a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] named [[Gleezwuq]]. Gleezwuq was the only member of Blix's gang that Windy did not know the location of. He was sure that Gleezwuq would have evidence which would implicate Blix in his murder of Alita Sweetwater.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nThe spacer managed to find the Rodian gang member, and killed him. On Gleezwuq's person was the same [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] that Blix used in his murder of Alita. The spacer brought the blaster back to an impressed Windy, who was now certain that Blix could be brought to justice. The spacer was once again awarded another 30 credits. Unfortunately, shortly after the evidence was brought to Windy, Blix's cohorts broke into town and helped Blix escape Anchorhead. Windy tasked the spacer with one final task, which was to find Blix and his cronies. Windy did not believe that Blix would let himself be brought back alive again. He told the spacer to do what he had to do. Ultimately, the spacer found Blix, and killed him and the other thugs. Following the successful operation, Windy awarded the spacer 100 credits.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlita Sweetwater was a character briefly mentioned in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. Players who performed a series of [[:w:c:swg:Quest|quests]] for [[Windy Starkiller]] in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] learned that Alita Sweetwater was murdered by [[Blix Lanister]] in the [[City/Legends|town]] of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Players who performed a series of [[:w:c:Quest|quests]] for [[Windy Starkiller]] had to escort Blix Lanister to [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]], kill [[Gleezwuq]] outside of [[City/Legends|town]], and then kill Lanister when he escaped from Anchorhead. The series of quests involved implicating Blix Lanister in the murder of Alita Sweetwater.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nFor unknown reasons, Windy was removed from ''Star Wars Galaxies'' less than a year after its release, during [[:w:c:swg:Publish 6 Notes:11 February 04|Publish 6]] on [[February 11]], [[2004]]. Because Alita did not actually appear in the [[Video game|game]], her [[Species/Legends|species]] cannot be determined. However, the quest dialogue given by Windy indicated that Alita was a [[Gender/Legends|female]]. Although the player could choose not to do Windy's quests, this article assumes 100% game completion.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Blix's Blaster}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sweetwater, Alita}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
