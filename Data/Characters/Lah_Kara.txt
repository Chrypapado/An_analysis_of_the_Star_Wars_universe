When [[Margrave]] [[Juro]] attempted to revive the long-gone [[Jedi Order]], Kara was tasked with delivering several of her [[Parent|father's]] weapons when agents of the [[Sith]] came to take them. After fleeing from one of them on her [[speeder]], she eventually destroyed her pursuer. She then hired a [[droid]] [[pilot]] to fly her to the other [[Jedi]] who were awaiting their weapons at the [[Aerial Temple]]. However, all of them, save [[Ethan]], turned out to be Sith when Juro revealed himself. Kara then drew her lightsaber alongside Juro as well as Ethan and defeated them. She was then asked to join Juro as the \"Ninth Jedi\" to rebuild the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Ninth Jedi\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Lah Kara}} \nLah Kara appeared in \"[[The Ninth Jedi]],\" a [[2021]] ''[[Star Wars: Visions]]'' short film.<ref name=\"Meet the Heroes\" /> She is voiced by [[Chinatsu Akasaki]] in Japanese and [[Kimiko Glenn]] in English.<ref name=\"Cast\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast|text=Stunning New ''Star Wars: Visions'' Trailer Debuts}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{VisionsCite|The Ninth Jedi}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast|text=Stunning New ''Star Wars: Visions'' Trailer Debuts}} {{1stm}}\n*{{SW|url=news/inside-star-wars-visions-meet-the-heroes|text=Inside ''Star Wars: Visions'': Meet the Heroes}}\n*{{InsiderCite|205|Launchpad}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Hy Izlan residents]]\n[[Category:Jedi individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
