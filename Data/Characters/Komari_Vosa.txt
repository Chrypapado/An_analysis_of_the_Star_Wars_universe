Instead, she became a liability.|Darth Tyranus|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter}}\n'''Komari Vosa''', a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], was a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|fallen]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who served as leader of the [[Bando Gora/Legends|Bando Gora]] during the final [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Though highly regarded by her [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]], [[Count of Serenno/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], the former [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] following her [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|banishment]] from the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Amassing an [[Army/Legends|army]] of [[Bando Gora slave|mindless slaves]] and [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]], Vosa became a [[High Priestess|cult leader]] whose influence reached across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], allowing her to form connections with powerful [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lords]] such as the [[Hutt Cartel]] or the [[Dug/Legends|Dugs]] of [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]].\n\nAs her criminal empire expanded, Vosa came to the attention of [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]]&mdash;the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] who [[Grand Plan/Legends|conspired]] to topple the Republic from within. Viewing the former Jedi as a threat to his own [[Galactic Empire/Legends|plans for the future]], the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] ordered her [[Death/Legends|termination]]. The execution of this task was entrusted to Sidious' [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]], [[Count/Legends|Count]] Dooku, who adopted the persona of [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Tyranus after turning away from the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side of the Force]]. Rather than killing Vosa in person, Tyranus opted to place a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on his fallen apprentice. A [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] who was skilled enough to defeat a warrior trained in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] would, as Tyranus reasoned, make an ideal [[Prime clone|template]] for the [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone army]] in development on [[Kaminoan/Legends|Kamino]].\n\n[[The Hunt|The contest]] was ultimately won by [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]], one of the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] whom Tyranus hired to hunt and neutralize Vosa for the reward of [[Galactic Credit Standard|five million credits]]. After tracking Vosa to her [[Bando Gora citadel|citadel]] on [[Kohlma]], one of the [[Moon/Legends|moons]] of [[Bogden/Legends|Bogden]], Fett defeated the leader of the Bando Gora in spite of her [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] and [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber skills]]. Tyranus, who witnessed the battle from the shadows, asphyxiated Vosa [[Telekinesis/Legends|by way of the Force]] and subsequently persuaded Fett to be [[Cloning/Legends|cloned]]. In the years following Vosa's death, [[Asajj Ventress' lightsabers|her lightsabers]] were given to [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]], a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] assassin who aspired to join the ranks of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] with Tyranus as her [[Sith Master/Legends|mentor]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Jedi Order===\n{{Quote|Ah, the blast helmet of a Mandalorian warrior.

Despite possessing a volatile temperament, Vosa proved to be a prodigious student in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]],<ref name=\"Databank\" /> earning the respect of her Master who regarded Vosa as an excellent apprentice.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\nKomari Vosa accompanied Master Dooku and a [[Jedi strike force]] to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Galidraan/Legends|Galidraan]]<ref name=\"Databank\" /> in [[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]]<ref name=\"JvS\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref> with orders from the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] to neutralize the [[True Mandalorians]].<ref name=\"Open Seasons\" /> The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] virtually annihilated their [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] adversaries in the [[Battle of Galidraan]]; Vosa herself demonstrated considerable [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|skill]] with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] when she personally [[Death/Legends|killed]] twenty experienced [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] in combat. Though the Council later came to regret the massacre on Galidraan, Dooku was impressed by his apprentice's [[Force power/Legends|natural talents]] and believed that Vosa's future was all but secure in the ranks of the Order.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nVosa's status as a rising star in the Jedi Order was cut short when her Master barred her from participating in the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]]. Dooku, along with the members of the Jedi Council, became aware of Vosa's secret infatuation with her legendary Master. This and her aggressive demeanor convinced the Order to end Vosa's [[Jedi training/Legends|training]], thus deeming her unfit to become a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. Enraged at what she perceived as a betrayal by her Master and the Council, Vosa fled the [[Jedi Temple]] and joined a Jedi task force deployed to stop the [[Bando Gora/Legends|Bando Gora's]] activities on [[Baltizaar/Legends|Baltizaar]]. The mission was a disaster, however. The team was [[Battle of Baltizaar|decimated]] and forced to retreat back to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]; many Jedi lost their lives and others were captured, including Vosa.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nThough the Order believed her to be dead, in truth Komari Vosa remained alive and was held as a [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] by the mysterious cult in a [[Bando Gora citadel|dilapidated citadel]] on [[Kohlma]], a burial [[Moon/Legends|moon]] orbiting [[Bogden/Legends|Bogden]]. Subjected to [[Torture/Legends|torture]] and other forms of cruelty, Vosa was driven both mad and into the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. Embracing her [[Force rage|rage]], the deranged Jedi defeated her tormentors and replaced them as the new leader of the Bando Gora.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\n===Bando Gora===\n{{Quote|I once tried to resist.

In order to do so, Vosa implanted brainwashing agents into [[Death stick/Legends|death sticks]], intending to use narcotics as a recruiting tool for the Bando Gora.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> The poisonous substances\u2014mind-altering neurotoxins\u2014were developed and conditioned to suppress individuality and free will, thus enabling Vosa to use her Force abilities to turn drug-addicts into mindless [[Spy/Legends|spies]] and [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]].<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" /> This form of [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] gradually built her a small [[Army/Legends|army]] of [[Bando Gora slave|warriors]] that Vosa deployed on the enemies of her cult.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nThe secrecy of the Bando Gora's operation necessitated the use of assets who retained their free will, leading Vosa to recruit criminals such as [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder/Legends|Gardulla]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], [[Sebolto]], and [[Groff Haugg]]; the extent of her influence even infiltrated the ranks of the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], causing the corrupt [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Connus Trell]] to serve Vosa as an agent of the Bando Gora. In short, her plan involved shipping the neurotoxic agents to Gardulla on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] to cover her trail. The contraband cargo was then sent to [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]], where Sebolto processed the poison into the death sticks before delivering the dangerously modified narcotics to Coruscant's underworld leaders, including Haugg, for smuggling.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\nIn the year [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], Vosa and the Bando Gora were involved with a plot to kill [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Hego Damask]] that was masterminded by the [[Monarch of Naboo|King]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], [[Ars Veruna/Legends|Ars Veruna]]. Damask was secretly the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] of [[Order of the Sith Lords|the Sith]] Darth Plagueis, though none of the conspirators, including [[Alexi Garyn]]'s [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] crime syndicate, knew this and wanted revenge against him for their own reasons.<ref name=\"DP\">[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]</ref>\n\n[[File:Earlytyranus.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Threatened by Vosa's growing influence, Darth Sidious ordered his new apprentice, Darth Tyranus, to kill the Bando Gora cultist.]]\nPlagueis's [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]] tried to manipulate events such that the plot would succeed. To enable the conspirators, he sent his own apprentice, [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul]], to the prison space station [[Cog Hive Seven]], with the mission to contact arms dealer [[Iram Radique]] and deliver a [[Nuclear bomb|nuclear device]] to the Bando Gora. Maul summoned Vosa to the station using a code provided by former Bando Gora member [[Artagan Truax]].<ref name=\"Lockdown\">''[[Maul: Lockdown]]''</ref>\n\nVosa and her followers arrived on the station as it was being destroyed due to a combination of Maul's actions and an attack by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]]. She encountered a freshly wounded Maul, but she did not know of his intention to aid her, so she attacked him. This proved to be a mistake, as she didn't know that she was going up against a full-fledged [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]]. Their duel was interrupted by the [[Syrox]], a monstrous being that inhabited the station. Vosa and Maul killed the Syrox together. Vosa now agreed to work with Maul to take possession of the nuclear device. They escaped the destruction of Cog Hive Seven.<ref name=\"Lockdown\" />\n\nThe Black Sun and Bando Gora conspirators, taking clandestine flight to the [[Carrion sector]], deployed the newly acquired nuclear device on the moon of [[Sojourn]], targeting Damask's fortress-residence and life-extension laboratories there. However, Jabba, through his spy network, had learned of the attack and was able to warn Damask, helping him to escape by personal rescue in the Hutt's space yacht [[Star Jewel/Legends|''Star Jewel'']]. While the galaxy's senior Dark Lord planned vengeance on all of the conspiratorial parties, including King Veruna, Black Sun, and Gardulla (whose fate he left to Jabba), Plagueis decided not to exact revenge on Vosa and the Bando Gora immediately.<ref name=\"DP\" />\n\n[[File:JangoRecruited-SWBH.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jango Fett was one of several bounty hunters that Tyranus invited to participate in the hunt for Vosa.]]\nIn the aftermath of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|crisis]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]],<ref name=\"TPM\" /> Darth Sidious<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />&mdash;who was in fact the secret persona of the newly-elected [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine<ref name=\"EncyclopediaSidious\">{{SWE|characters|darthsidious|Darth Sidious}}</ref>&mdash;decided that the time had come to eliminate the leader of the Bando Gora. Sidious found Vosa to be a nuisance and was convinced that the demented Dark Jedi was a threat to his own [[Grand Plan/Legends|plans]] for the [[New Order/Legends|future]] of the galaxy. By then, Vosa's former Master Dooku had renounced his allegiance to the Jedi Order and had secretly become [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Tyranus, the new apprentice of the Dark Lord.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" /> While Dooku's decision was solidified by the death of his first apprentice [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], who had helped resolve the Naboo crisis at the cost of his life, the drop which had earlier made the defection vase begin to overflow was when Dooku learned that Vosa was still alive and leading a group that could pose a threat to the Republic.<ref name=\"DP\" />\n\nDespite his initial reluctance, Tyranus complied with his Master's order to kill Vosa. In addition to dismantling the Bando Gora, the Sith Lord-in-[[Sith training|training]] was also instructed to locate a suitable [[DNA/Legends|genotype]] that would serve as the [[Prime clone|basis]] for a massive army of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone soldiers]]. Placing a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on Vosa in the amount of five million [[Galactic Credit Standard|Republic credits]], Tyranus intended to accomplish both tasks with a single [[The Hunt|contest]]. At Sidious's suggestion, Tyranus hired several of the galaxy's most lethal [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]], including two Mandalorian [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]]-turned-[[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]] and [[Montross (bounty hunter)|Montross]].<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\n[[File:Vosajango.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Captured by Vosa's followers, Fett was subjected to torture and interrogation by the fallen Jedi.]]\nGroff Haugg and Senator Trell were both killed when Fett and Montross&mdash;working in competition against one another&mdash;[[Mission to Coruscant (The Hunt)|tracked]] Komari Vosa's low-level operatives to Coruscant. Her spies relayed the setbacks to their operations on the Republic [[Capital/Legends|capital]], but the Dark Jedi dismissed the lost assets as irrelevant, insisting that gangsters and corrupt politicians were easily replaceable. She was also unconcerned about the hunters who were tracking her, given that the location of her citadel remained unknown to all but a select few contacts. However, she did vow to have Fett and Montross killed if either of them made any more progress in their search for her.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\nFett's exploits on [[Mission to Malastare (The Hunt)|Malastare]] and [[Mission to Tatooine (The Hunt)|Tatooine]] resulted in the loss of Sebolto and (ostensibly) Gardulla, thus disrupting the Bando Gora's operations even further, much to the annoyance of Komari Vosa. With most of her underworld contacts dead and the cult's criminal network in disarray, Vosa admitted that she had underestimated Fett and Montross. She then issued an order for the deaths of both mercenaries, turning the hunters into prey for the Bando Gora.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\n[[File:BH_KomariZam.png|thumb|right|250px|Zam Wesell's interference prevented Vosa from continuing her interrogation of Fett.]]\nWith the aid of a female [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]] named [[Rozatta]], Jango Fett learned that Komari Vosa's hidden base was located on Kohlma. He [[Mission to Kohlma|traveled]] to the dark moon in order to finish the hunt, but was also trailed by Montross who sought to claim Tyranus's reward. After killing numerous Bando Gora assassins, including Montross in a final duel to the death, Fett fought his way to the front entrance of the citadel. Upon entering the fortress however, he was quickly overwhelmed and captured by Vosa's followers. The Bando Gora tortured the bounty hunter in order to discern the identity of his employer, but Fett refused to cooperate in spite of the physical pain he endured. Vosa used a more psychological approach when she took over the interrogation, recalling her achievements against the Mandalorians on Galidraan during her life as a Jedi. Amused at the persistence of Fett's resistance to her methods, Vosa promised to enslave Fett to her will.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\nFett was ultimately saved by [[Zam Wesell/Legends|Zam Wesell]], a female [[Clawdite/Legends|Clawdite]] mercenary who followed him to Kohlma in the hopes of claiming the five million credits for herself. Although she killed two Bando Gora guards, Wesell's skills with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] were inefficient against Vosa's training in [[Jar'Kai/Legends|Jar'Kai]]. Wielding [[Asajj Ventress' lightsabers|two curved-hilted lightsabers]], the fallen Jedi easily [[Form III/Legends|parried]] the blaster shots before [[Form V/Legends|redirecting]] a single stray bolt into Wesell's shoulder. As Vosa moved to [[Sai cha/Legends|decapitate]] her, Wesell freed Fett of his restraints in desperation. Though momentarily caught off guard, Vosa retreated deeper into the center of the citadel with Fett in pursuit.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\n===Death===\n{{Quote|He is here.|Komari Vosa's last words, referring to Darth Tyranus|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter}}\n[[File:Closingeyes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tyranus killed Vosa by way of the Force after she was defeated in battle by Fett.]]\nThe former Jedi Padawan and the Mandalorian bounty hunter confronted each other in Komari Vosa's throne room. Outmatched by Vosa's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] skills and Force powers, Fett relied on his [[JT-12 jetpack/Legends|JT-12 jetpack]] and the advanced weaponry of his [[Mandalorian armor/Legends|armor]] in order to stand a fighting chance against an opponent who was trained in the Jedi arts. He eventually defeated Vosa, but chose to spare her life as the reward was the same whether she was dead or alive upon capture. At that moment, Vosa [[Force sense/Legends|felt]] nearby her old Master's presence in the Force. She then struggled for a few moments against his [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Choke|telekinetic grasp]] on her throat, but was ultimately throttled to death by Darth Tyranus.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\nAlthough Tyranus was disappointed to lose a student as promising as Komari Vosa, he nonetheless congratulated Jango Fett for winning the contest. In addition to the five million credits, he offered to pay even more if the bounty hunter agreed to travel to [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]] to be [[Cloning/Legends|cloned]]. Despite Fett's initial wariness, he agreed to become the template for a massive army of clones, all made in his own image and modified with accelerated growth and programmed obedience. He further complied with Tyranus's request that he personally oversee the clones' development and training to ensure that they became the perfect warriors. However, Fett's consent was based on the condition that he be allowed to claim the [[Boba Fett/Legends|first clone]] for himself; a clone unmodified by genetic tampering and accelerated growth. Tyranus agreed to Fett's single demand and the two shook hands in agreement above Vosa's dead body, thus initiating the creation of the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Imagine, an army of clones, the training of which you will oversee.

This was the Jedi weapon that she used on Galidraan to kill twenty seasoned warriors during the Jedi Order's confrontation with the True Mandalorians.<ref name=\"Open Seasons\" /> After her fall to the dark side of the Force, Vosa created two identical [[Color/Legends|red]]-bladed lightsabers that contained a [[Synthetic lightsaber crystal|synthetic crystal]]. Both sabers were built with a curved-hilt,<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" /> reflecting her former Jedi Master's own weapon.<ref name=\"AOTC\" /> After Vosa's death, her lightsabers remained in Darth Tyranus's possession for years until he gave them both to Asajj Ventress.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKomari Vosa was voiced by [[Tamara Phillips]] in ''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]''.\n\nIn an alternate ending to ''Bounty Hunter'', if the player loses against Komari Vosa, she leaps onto Jango Fett's shoulders and slices his head off with her dual lightsabers,<ref name=\"Bounty Hunter\" /> mirroring Fett's [[canon]]ical demise by in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']],<ref name=\"AOTC\" /> and Dooku's death in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref name=\"ROTS\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\nA date for Komari Vosa's apprenticeship to Dooku ([[50 BBY/Legends|50 BBY]]) is given in the ''[[Star Wars Annual 2008]]'' as part of a timeline in Dooku's article. However, since the timeline has other obvious continuity issues, the date may not be accurate. Assuming Vosa was 12 years old when she was chosen as a Padawan, this gives her an approximate birthdate of [[62 BBY/Legends|62 BBY]].<ref name=\"Annual 2008\" /> She would then have been about 18 at the current placement of the [[Battle of Galidraan]] ([[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]]), and would have been captured by the Bando Gora at approximately age 23 in [[39 BBY/Legends|39 BBY]],<ref name=\"JvS\" /> or age 29, if one subscribes to the dating of the [[Battle of Baltizaar]] ([[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]]) in [[James Luceno]]'s novel [[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']];<ref name=\"DP\" /> she would have died at age 24, or age 30, respectively.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Komari Vosa}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Maul: Lockdown]]''\n*[[Maul: Lockdown (audiobook)|''Maul: Lockdown'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]''\n*[[Jango Fett: Open Seasons 3|''Jango Fett: Open Seasons'' 3]] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*[[Jango Fett: Open Seasons 4|''Jango Fett: Open Seasons'' 4]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns]]'' {{C|DataBank}} {{Mo}} {{1stID}}\n*{{TCW|The Lost One}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|10|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (article)|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter}} {{1stm}}\n*{{InsiderCite|63|Gamescape}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20021121komari|text=Komari Vosa|int=Komari Vosa (article)|archivedate=20091016011143}}\n*{{FFCite|46|DOO2, ''Count Dooku''}}\n*{{FFCite|104|SUR2, ''The Survival of Boba Fett''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Bounty Hunters (Star Wars Miniatures)]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Annual 2008]]''\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]\n*''[[Threats of the Galaxy]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Scum and Villainy (sourcebook)|''Scum and Villainy'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Clone Wars Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 34]]''\n*{{DB|character|gardullathehutt|Gardulla the Hutt|archivedate=20100927174547}}\n*{{DB|character|komarivosa|Vosa, Komari|archivedate=20100330041653}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{InsiderCite|146|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Komari Vosa\n|de=Komari Vosa#legends\n|es=Komari Vosa\n|it=Komari Vosa\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0430\n|hu=Komari Vosa\n|pt=Komari Vosa\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vosa, Komari}}\n[[Category:Bando Gora]]\n[[Category:Bogden residents]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Fallen Jedi]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Guardians]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Torturers and interrogators]]"}}}]}}}}
