There, he met and later married Kay. With some savings, Tallon could afford having two servants, [[Morr Wenn|Morr]] and [[Cala Wenn]], and a majordomo droid, [[LN-26]].\n\nAfter an amount of years living with Adar, a group of [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] came looking for him. Although Adar had friends that helped him to defend himself, such as [[Vytor Shrike]], [[Jungen]] and [[Quist (pirate)|Quist]], the old commander decided that he was no longer safe on Tatooine, specially once Quist betrayed him and a team of Rebel agents protecting him. Adar Tallon decided to leave Tatooine and join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. Kay and LN-26 would go with him.\n\nAfter that, Tallon became commanding officer of a small fleet, including the cruiser ''[[Silent Water]]'' as flagship.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tatooine Manhunt]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Classic Adventures: Volume Three|story=Tatooine Manhunt}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Kay Tallon\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tallon, Kay}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
