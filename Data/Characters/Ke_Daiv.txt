In the service of [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]], and dispossessed by his own people, he had the unfortunate distinction, in [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], of being the \"first personal kill\" of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], then a 12-year-old [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] on a mission to [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]] with his [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref name=\"RP\">''[[Rogue Planet]]''</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nAn orphan, Daiv was adopted into the family of one of the last Blood Carver clans. The clan leader commanded Daiv to take the son of his benefactor on a ritual [[feragriff]] hunt on one of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant's]] moons, despite the fact it was prophesied he would [[Death/Legends|die]] of a head wound. Daiv accidentally killed the young Blood Carver with a stray shot to the head, for which he was exiled from his tribe.\n\n[[File:Rogue_Planet_by_Jeff_Carlisle.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalkers stands over Daiv's body in shock.]]\nHe was hired by dissident members of the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] to kill Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker for his role in the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]]. In [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], he very nearly killed Anakin during a [[Pit racing|Pit race]] in the [[Wicko District Garbage Pit]]. However, Anakin's mentor, [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] Obi-Wan Kenobi, arrived just in time to foil his attempt to kill Anakin. Ke Daiv barely managed to escape from the encounter with his life. Shortly after Daiv's failure to kill Anakin during the garbage pit race, Wilhuff Tarkin sent him to Zonama Sekot with [[Raith Sienar/Legends|Raith Sienar]], with orders to kill Sienar if he deviated from Tarkin's plan. However, Sienar convinced Daiv to ignore Tarkin's orders, and sent him to buy one of Zonama Sekot's organic [[Sekotan Personal Starship|starships]]. The [[Seed-partner]]s rejected him, so instead he kidnapped Skywalker and a young native girl, [[Jabitha Hal|Jabitha]]. He threatened Jabitha's life in order to force Skywalker to take him on [[Jabitha|his own Sekotan starship]]. During this time, Tarkin launched his [[Second Battle of Zonama Sekot|attack]] on the planet. Daiv forced Skywalker to fly to the [[Magister's Palace]] to refuel the ship. Once there, Skywalker, weaponless, killed Daiv by the sheer power of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], an action he regretted.<ref name=\"RP\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rogue Planet]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Anakin: Apprentice]]'' {{1stp}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' novel]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (audiobook)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|62|Who's Who in the Jedi Order}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ke Daiv\n|ru=\u041a\u0435 \u0414\u0430\u0438\u0432\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daiv, Ke}}\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Blood Carvers]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
