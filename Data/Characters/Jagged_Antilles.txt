Jagged owned the Corellian Inter-System Marketing Station and [[Antilles fueling depot|fuel depot]] on the [[Gus Treta Inner-System Market Station]] with his wife, [[Zena Antilles|Zena]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe and his wife were [[Death/Legends|killed]] when the [[Bonestar Pirates]], trying to escape from Corellian authorities, lifted off while refueling lines were still attached to their ship. The resulting explosion threatened to destroy Gus Treta, but Jagged and Zena sacrificed themselves to limit the destruction to their depot.\n\nBoth his children Wedge and Syal became famous across the galaxy, his son as a [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] leader in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and later a [[General/Legends|general]] in the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] and his daughter as a famous [[Holodrama/Legends|holodrama]] star in the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\nHis grandson [[Jagged Fel]] was named after him.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDuring production of the [[2005]] film [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], the final installment of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[prequel trilogy]], [[Sang Jun Lee]] produced a piece of concept art which featured [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]]' father.
