During [[1 ABY/Legends|1.5 ABY]], he sent a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named [[Rhalia Jinsari]] to kill [[Vardias Tyne]] after he ended up killing a [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] that was destroying his [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|vaporators]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|This gift conveys respect for the majesty of these great creatures. You may tell your employer that the Dim-U will pursue him no further.|Chonar|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring [[1 ABY/Legends|1.5 ABY]], [[Vardias Tyne]], a resident of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], killed a [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] that was destroying his [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|vaporators]]. Unfortunately for Vardias, Brother Chonar and his bantha-worshipping [[Dim-U]] monks learned of this, and hired a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named [[Rhalia Jinsari]] to kill Vardias Tyne.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\n[[File:BanthaStatue.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The small [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] statue, given to Brother Chonar as a gift for forgiveness.]]\nHowever, before Rhalia could reach [[City/Legends|town]], she was killed by a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who agreed to help Vardias. Despite this, Vardias knew his troubles were not yet over. He knew that the Chonar and the Dim-U would simply send another bounty hunter when they learned of Jinsari's demise. In order to calm down the Dim-U, Vardias had a talented [[Artist/Legends|artist]] sculpt a bantha statue out of a piece of [[kiliad marble]]. He tasked the spacer who had helped him earlier with deliving the bantha statue to Chonar, with the hope that they would forgive and forget the killing of the bantha. The spacer agreed, and sought out to find Chonar who was just outside of Anchorhead. When Chonar received the statue, he told the spacer that the statue conveyed the respect for the majestic banthas, and informed the spacer that the Dim-U would no longer pursue Vardias Tyne.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Chonar.jpg|150px|thumb|Randomly generated depiction of Chonar]]\nBrother Chonar was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. Players who performed a series of [[:w:c:swg:Quest|quests]] for [[Vardias Tyne]] in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] had to deliver a [[Bantha/Legends|bantha]] statue to Chonar outside of [[City/Legends|town]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nDue to the nature of many older quests in ''Star Wars Galaxies'', the [[Species/Legends|species]] and appearance of Chonar changed each time a player performed this quest. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the [[canon]]ical species of Chonar. However, the quest dialogue given by Vardias Tyne indicated that Chonar was a [[Gender/Legends|male]]. Although the player could choose not to do Vardias Tyne's quests, this article assumes 100% game completion.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Chonar}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
