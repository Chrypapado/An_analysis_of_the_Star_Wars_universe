Tukalda took a dislike to Wexley after the two found political differences during a community dinner party. When [[Resistance]] [[T-70 X-wing starfighter|X-wings]] were landed outside Wexley's home, Tukalda reported the sighting to the [[First Order]], but, when things escalated and Wedge and Norra fought the guards, Norra instantly knocked Tukalda out with a punch to the head. After the fight, the couple decided to gag and tie up Tukalda before throwing her in with the [[Death|dead]] First Order officers.<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Resistance Reborn]]'' {{1st|[[Resistance Reborn (audiobook)|''Resistance Reborn'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Resistance Reborn (audiobook)|''Resistance Reborn'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30c4\u30ab\u30eb\u30c0\n}}\n\n[[Category:Abednedo]]\n[[Category:Akivans]]\n[[Category:Females]]"}}}]}}}}
