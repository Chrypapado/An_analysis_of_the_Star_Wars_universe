I want nothing. I am only a runner. I work for the man who hired me.|Unidentified Twi'lek messenger to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\nThis unidentified, green-skinned '''Twi'lek''' male was hired as a messenger for the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] [[Canderous Ordo]] during the latter's employment as [[Davik Kang]]'s enforcer on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[3956 BBY]], this individual attended that year's [[Tarisian Season Opener]], and witnessed [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] post the best time. Shortly after the culmination of the race, the messenger approached Revan and his companions in the [[South Apartments]] of the [[Upper City]], with a message from Canderous. Identifying him as the winner of the [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] race, the Twi'lek implored Revan to meet his employer in the [[Upper City Cantina]]. He warned Revan not to delay, having an awareness of the lack of patience common to many Mandalorians.\n\nAfter delivering his message, the Twi'lek departed. He may have perished in the [[Destruction of Taris|bombing of Taris]] carried out under the orders of [[Darth Malak]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|You there &ndash; human. You are the rider who won the Great Swoop Race in the Lower City, yes?|Unidentified Twi'lek messenger to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\nThis individual was a straightforward being who deferred to his employer, considering himself little more than \"a runner.\" He recognized [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] on sight as the winner of the [[Tarisian Season Opener]], and was aware both of Ordo's connections to the [[Exchange]] and of the impatience of many [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]], including his employer.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThis individual is referred to only as \"Twi'lek\" in ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'', and makes a single appearance outside the player's hideout following the [[rescue of Bastila Shan]], leading to the \"Slicing Through Sith Security\" quest. He shares the same character model and clothing as other green Twi'leks in the game, including [[Bib Surool]], [[Larrim]] and [[Karal Kaar]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nHis NPC file name is \"tar02_rodianmsg\" which suggests that he was originally intended to be a Rodian instead of a Twi'lek. His sound Set in the same file is also set to \"Rodian\" though it is unheard in-game as he is never turned hostile.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0432\u0438'\u043b\u0435\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
