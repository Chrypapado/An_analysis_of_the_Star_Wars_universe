After being hounded by the [[Exchange]] for their cut of the profits, Lupo found a way to fix the races and keep every last credit: by going \"legit.\"\n\nHe commissioned an [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] droid dealer named [[Kodin]] to create a droid that could pilot a swoop bike better than any sentient ever could. With a droid's body, his new pilot could withstand much greater trauma than flesh-and-blood organics, and all of the weighty safety features could be removed from the swoop bike. Even the Hutts were unable to discover a loophole in this arrangement, thanks to the Exchange's rather strict rules concerning \"legality\" and business enterprises.\n\nBecause it was no longer the Exchange's racer anyway, Lupo pulled out from his dealings with them altogether. This had the unfortunate side effect of completely drying up his business, since every potential paying customer became scared of racing against the \"unbeatable\" droid champion.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|As \"Lupo\"}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lupo Shar\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shar, Lupo}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
