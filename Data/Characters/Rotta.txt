During the [[Clone Wars]], he was secretly kidnapped by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], which was orchestrated by [[Count]] [[Dooku]] with help from [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]], Rotta's great-uncle. The plot was meant to discredit the [[Jedi Order]] and scuttle negotiations between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the Hutts, but the Jedi were able to rescue him. He was kidnapped by [[Asajj Ventress]] and taken to the planet [[Teth]]. Then the Jedi came and got him. He then became sick and nearly died on his way to [[Tatooine]], but survived thanks to Ahsoka Tano. After [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Tano evaded Dooku, who tried to kill Rotta and blame the Jedi, Rotta was returned to his father.<ref name=\"TCWFilm\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRotta appears in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]], where he was vocalized by [[David Acord]].<ref name=\"TCWFilm\" /> Per Supervising Director [[Dave Filoni]]'s initial series concept, Rotta was intended to be a character in the series alongside his father, Jabba.
