In this comic, she refers to her rancor and the destruction of her village. This corresponds to the young Felucian that can be seen in ''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'', in the ''Rancor Rampage'' activity. In addition, both have exactly the same clothing, confirming that Kralla is the same person.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{TCWUKCite|6.43|Downhill}}\n\n[[Category:Felucia residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]"}}}]}}}}
