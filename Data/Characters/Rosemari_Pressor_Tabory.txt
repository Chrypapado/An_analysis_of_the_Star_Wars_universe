She grew up aboard the wreckage of ''[[Outbound Flight Project]]'' and eventually became a teacher for the young people of the colony. Both Rosemari and Jorad went to great lengths to conceal the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]] of Evlyn from Colony Director [[Chas Uliar]], as he would sentence her to a life of isolation in [[Dreadnaught-Three|''D-Three'']].\n\nAfter the remains of ''Outbound Flight'' were recovered, Rosemari and Evlyn went to live in the [[Empire of the Hand]] with the rest of the evacuees.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the novel [[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], the name of Jorad's sister was given as [[Katarin Pressor|Katarin]]. Whether Rosemari is the same person as Katarin or is another sister born after the crash is unknown. However, ''Survivor's Quest'' implies that she was born after the crash.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rosemari Pressor Tabory\n|fi=Rosemari Pressor Tabory\n}}\n\n[[Category:Educators|Tabory, Rosemari Pressor]]\n[[Category:Empire of the Hand citizens|Tabory, Rosemari Pressor]]\n[[Category:Females|Tabory, Rosemari Pressor]]\n[[Category:Humans|Tabory, Rosemari Pressor]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight residents|Tabory, Rosemari Pressor]]"}}}]}}}}
