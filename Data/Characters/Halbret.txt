During the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] she brought together a contingent of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knights to defeat a powerful [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] who had enslaved the [[Kathol (species)|Kathol]] species. During the ensuing battle, one of the Kathol's [[launch gate]]s activated, overloaded and exploded. The explosion tore a hole in [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] and [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], tainting the region with the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. She was protected by using a Precursor impact pod and willed herself into a trance using Jedi meditation. Unfortunately, Darkstryder activated the pod, trapping her. While Halbret was trapped ages passed, and the Jedi Order she once belonged to was wiped out. She was later awakened by the crew of the ''[[FarStar]]'', and it was discovered she shared common ancestry with [[Jessa Dajus]]. During the final battle with the [[DarkStryder]], she died saving Jessa from the DarkStryder's cohorts, and became one with the Force.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DarkStryder|Endgame (RPG adventure)|Endgame}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Gamemaster Handbook]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Kathol Rift]]''\n*''[[Endgame]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Knights of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
