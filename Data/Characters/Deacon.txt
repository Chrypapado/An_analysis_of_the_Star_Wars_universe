Another [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] acquaintance, [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]], once characterized Windy as \"a follower\" and called Deak \"a follower of a follower\".<ref name=\"SWradio\">[[Star Wars radio drama]]</ref>\n\n{{Talesstart}}\n[[File:Deak_and_Windy_LS_Detective.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Deak and Windy]]\nDeak and Windy were present when Luke was challenged to a speeder race by a local braggart, [[Gorm Maldorf]], in [[The Cage]]. The boys warned Luke that Maldorf was dangerous, but he accepted the challenge. On the morning of the race, Gorm was found dead, strangled, in The Cage. After Deak and Windy helped him make his escape, Luke investigated the death and deduced that Gorm had been accidentally killed while trying to sabotage the race the night before.<ref name=\"lsdetective\">{{Tales|20|Luke Skywalker: Detective}}</ref>\n{{Talesend}}\n\nBy their late teens, the friends were part of a group of youths that included Biggs Darklighter, [[Janek Sunber|Janek \"Tank\" Sunber]], [[Laze Loneozner/Legends|Laze \"Fixer\" Loneozner]], and his girlfriend [[Camie Loneozner|Camie]]. The teens spent time hanging around at [[Tosche Station/Legends|Tosche Station]] in Anchorhead. They flew their [[T-16 skyhopper/Legends|T-16 skyhoppers]] in mock aerial duels and raced through twisting canyons near their homes.<ref name=\"SWradio\" />\n\nWhen Biggs was accepted into [[Imperial Academy/Legends|the Academy]], the friends and other locals threw him a party that was broken up by attacking [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]].<ref name=\"mc17\">[[Star Wars (1977) 17|''Star Wars'' (1977) 17]]</ref> Some time later, just before the [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] was captured by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] above Tatooine, Luke challenged Fixer to a dangerous skyhopper race. Deak thought Luke had no chance of winning, and flew along with Fixer during the race. Deak last saw Luke on the morning Biggs confided in Luke about his plans to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name=\"SWradio\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Deak_Galaxy_2.jpg|thumb|Deak in 0 BBY]]\nDeak was played by [[Jay Benedict]] in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], appearing only in the Anchorhead scene which didn't make it into the final cut of the film. The scene was later included in the Blu-Ray release. In the [[Star Wars (radio)|radio drama]] he was voiced by [[David Paymer]]. He has a single line in the script, although in the scene as shot, this seems to have been extended into a brief background conversation between himself and Windy. On the other hand, although Luke mentions mock-dogfights with Deak in the script, this line does not appear in the cut footage, which fades into the scene on the next line.\n\n\"Deak Starkiller\" first appeared in the [[The Star Wars: Rough Draft|rough draft]] of Star Wars as the younger brother of [[Annikin Starkiller]] and son of [[Kane Starkiller]]; he is killed by a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] in one of the opening scenes. In the [[The Star Wars: First Draft|first draft]] he was renamed Bink Valor, which was probably the origin of [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks's]] last name. Bink suffered the same fate, however. His more heroic turn was as a [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] of a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] freighter and [[Aquillian Ranger]] in the [[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars|second draft]]. He is the older brother of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Starkiller]], Windy and [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs]]. It is Deak who is imprisoned by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and must be freed in this version, not [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]]. He becomes one of Luke's friends at the power station in the third draft, with Windy.<ref>''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|20|Luke Skywalker: Detective}}\n*[[Empire 8|''Empire'' 8]]\n*''[[Star Wars Journal: The Fight for Justice]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' novelization]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{Del}}\n*''[[Star Wars radio drama]]''\n*''[[Jedi's Honor]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Rebel Force: Renegade]]''\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 17|''Star Wars'' (1977) 17]] {{Flash}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|35|Anchorhead: The Lost Scenes}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|94|Interviews}}\n*''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Deacon\n|ru=\u0414\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
