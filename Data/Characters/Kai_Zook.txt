Her husband was stationed aboard the [[Imperial prison barge]] [[Purge (prison barge)|''Purge'']] when its passengers contracted an unknown [[Imperial bioweapons Project I71A|plague]]. Omar wrote a letter to Kai after almost everyone on the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] had died from the disease, and he had been infected as well. He expressed his condolences for not being there for the boys and told her that he loved all of them. When [[Zahara Cody]], the chief medical officer of the ''Purge'', escaped the [[Prison/Legends|prison]] barge with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], and [[Trig Longo]], she managed to recover the letter and bring it with her. Zahara and Trig finished delivering the letter to Kai Zook, who was informed of her husband's [[Death/Legends|death]]. The letter was later released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the ''Purge'' incident.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Death Troopers]]'' {{1st|''Death Troopers'' audiobook}}\n*[[Death Troopers (audiobook)|''Death Troopers'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Death Troopers: Recovered Messages from Purge]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kai Zook\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zook, Kai}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]"}}}]}}}}
