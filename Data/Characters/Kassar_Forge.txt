He is the father of [[Lujayne Forge|Lujayne]] and [[Inyri Forge]], who both became [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]].\n\n==Biography==\nPrior to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Kassar volunteered to go Kessel, the infamous prison world, in an effort to teach and reform the criminals there, with the hopes of preventing them from returning to a life of crime upon their release. Following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], when inmates overthrew their masters and took control of the planet, he voluntarily remained on the moon, believing that he still could make a difference in the lives of the criminals.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''</ref>\n\nHe was a modest man who often described himself and his accomplishments in a self-deprecating fashion. He would often say he was not sure how much good he had done throughout his life, and he said he had been \"judged harmless\" by the Kessel residents from whom he earned respect.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nKassar fell in love with [[Myda Forge|Myda]], one of the inmates, and married her. Although she would not have chosen to live on Kessel without him, she remained by her husband's side and also began teaching there.\n\nThe two spent the rest of their lives on the planet, rejecting all opportunities to leave, including an offer by [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] in [[6 ABY/Legends|6.5 ABY]], who was freeing high-profile prisoners to help disrupt [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] operations on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] in the months leading up to its [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|liberation]].\n\nKassar and Myda had multiple sons and daughters, most of whom continued to live on the planet with them. Among their children were Lujayne and Inyri, who both went on to become pilots in Rogue Squadron, the elite group of starfighter pilots for the [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|New Republic Defense Force]].\n\nKassar passed knowledge from many of the trade skills that he taught to inmates on to his children. In particular, he instructed Lujayne on [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] repair, and her expertise in repairing and maintaining [[T-47 airspeeder/Legends|T-47 airspeeders]] proved particularly helpful during her time with Rogue Squadron.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\">''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]''</ref>\n\nIn 6.5 ABY, Kassar and his family were devastated by the loss of his daughter, Lujayne, who was killed in her sleep by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] during a surprise covert assault on [[Talasea]].\n\nHe was only slightly less troubled when his younger daughter, Inyri, became the \"[[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]] [[cutter]]\" and lover to [[Zekka Thyne]], a dangerous [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] criminal, who she insisted upon leaving Kessel with when he was selected by Wedge to be taken to Coruscant. Although Myda implored Wedge to separate the two when he took Zekka, Kassar insisted that Inyri had to be left to make her own decisions, much like the inmates he instructed were left to make their own paths after leaving their instruction.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kassar Forge\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forge, Kassar}}\n[[Category:Educators]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kesselians]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
