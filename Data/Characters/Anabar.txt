Anabar refused to give the Jedi Master a [[plasma fusion trigger]] or a [[proton missile launcher]], but did not mind giving Jinn a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] instead. Despite rejecting Jinn's [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] at first, he soon changed his mind thanks to his customer's [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]].\n{{Endgame}}\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAnabar appears in [[1999]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]].
