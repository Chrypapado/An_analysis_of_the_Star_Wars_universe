You are the Guardian now. It is you who protects the Emperor's mountain.|Grand Admiral Thrawn|Heir to the Empire}}\nThe '''Guardian of Mount Tantiss''' was a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] assigned by [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] to guard his storehouse at [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|Mount Tantiss]].\n\nSome years before [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] [[Thrawn campaign|arrived]] on [[Wayland]], the Guardian and the insane clone [[Joruus C'baoth]] fought one another and the Guardian was killed. His body lay in a crypt in C'baoth's palace surrounded by candles, one for every person who came to visit him after his death, all of whom (except Thrawn, [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]], and [[Rukh/Legends|Rukh]]) were subsequently killed by C'baoth.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|My original reasoning was just what's laid out here: that whomever Palpatine had left to guard his storehouse had been killed by Joruus C'baoth when he somehow stumbled on the place.|Timothy Zahn|Heir to the Empire: The 20th Anniversary Edition}}\nThere was some debate over whether C'baoth was indeed the original Guardian, or if he in fact killed him. Although the inhabitants of Wayland remembered a battle between two powerful [[The Force/Legends|Force]] users, they were also all under the mental control of the insane [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]], whose account was only substantiated by the coffin within a crypt that Grand Admiral Thrawn and Captain Pellaeon were taken to. The pair ''assumed'' this crypt to hold the body of the original Guardian, but nothing substantiated this assumption other than the mad clone's statements. The ''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]'' and the [[Databank (original)|Databank]] also said that all evidence indicated that Joruus was the sole Guardian. However, none of these sources gave an entirely objective affirmation or denial. It was not until [[2008]], with the release of ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', that it was confirmed within its entry on Mount Tantiss that the Guardian and C'Baoth were separate entities.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)|''Dark Force Rising'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Last Command]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|location|wayland|Wayland|archivedate=20100330082854}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Guardi\u00e1n del Monte Tantiss\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dark Side Adepts]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wayland residents]]"}}}]}}}}
