In [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]], Tryn accepted a teaching post at one of the prestigious universities on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] when [[General/Legends|General]] [[Lok Durd/Legends|Lok Durd]] kidnapped [[Bant'ena Fhernan]] who forced her to create a biological weapon for the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. After Bant'ena was taken, Tryn was contacted his old friend Organa who was sent by the Jedi to pick him up. When his friend arrived and told him about the situation, Tryn agreed to travel to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and assist the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].\n\nWhile working inside a Jedi laboratory, Tryn got resources needed by the Jedi and developed a sample from the biological weapon in order to produce a suitable antidote. He tested the substance in an experimental animal, and it achieved its effect. The work cost him a lot of power and brought him to his limits. When he was nearing completion, he discovered that he missed only one substance for his formula. He was angry and blamed himself for the fact that it still further pressuring. Soon afterwards, he traveled with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] to [[Lanteeb/Legends|Lanteeb]] to search for the biological weapon and find the last substance. He was able to develop the antidote after collecting a sample of a medicine from a Lanteebian village. Once he was sure that the substance was correct, he would use it against the toxic gases. Before his antidote could be used, however, the bioweapon was destroyed by Fhernan.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth]]'' {{1stm|[[Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege]]'' {{1st|[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Siege'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Siege'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tryn Netzl\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Netzl, Tryn}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
