However, his arm was crushed by faulty lifting equipment, so his employers gave him a prosthetic arm and paid him off, to avoid a lawsuit. Moorsey invested the money in the bar [[Spanner's]], in the city of [[Hedrett]] and started working there as a bartender. He was present when the [[heroes of Cularin]] visited Spanner's in about [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Oblivion's Kiss]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]"}}}]}}}}
