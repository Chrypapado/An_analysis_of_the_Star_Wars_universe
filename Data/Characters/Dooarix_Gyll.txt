Mitillan, a [[Force Adept]], would place high bets on Gyll's race and observe the race course as a spotter in violation of the leagues bylaws against outside aid to racers; ultimately they longed to leave [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Mitillan was using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to communicate with Gyll about obstacles on the race track, which helped them avoid anyone spotting a communication device.<ref name=\"EV\" />\n\nAfter their fifth win in six weeks, Gyll and Mitillan were interrogated by [[Tal Feint]], a [[Muun/Legends|Muun]] investigator who had seen each of the three races which gave them such success. Feint, who was employed by [[Zeto]], attempted to confront them about Mitillan's spotting operation, but was interrupted by Zeto who wished violence against the two racers. When Mitillan used the Force to throw Zeto against a wall, Feint used his own [[Mind trick/Legends|power of persuasion]] to send his employer's hired hands away and offered to help Gyll and Mitillan use their Force skills for things greater than fixing races.<ref name=\"EV\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Endless Vigil]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gyll, Dooarik}}\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Gand]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Podracers]]"}}}]}}}}
