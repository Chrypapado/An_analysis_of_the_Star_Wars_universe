He was the one who accepted an [[Hunter (individual)|unidentified bounty hunter]] into the Great Hunt on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. [[Mako (slicer)|Mako]], the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter's]] companion, nicknamed him \"Skullface\".\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[3643 BBY]], Grataa came to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] to the palace of [[Suudaa Nem'ro|Nem'ro]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] to watch the process of elimination. When one of the participants, [[Tarro Blood]], murdered [[Braden]] and [[Jory]], Grataa was able to watch the recording of the incident and began an investigation. When he met the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named [[Rarsk]], he gave the selected [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] instructions for the [[Great Hunt (Jedi)|Great Hunt]]. However, [[Mako (slicer)|Mako]] grew suspicious after she and her companion killed Rarsk who was tracking a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]]. Upon returning to the palace, Mako initially reacted nervously at his presence, but the [[Kaleesh/Legends|Kaleesh]] calmed her and explained the motives of their actions. He then gave the hunter and Mako a pass to enter a shuttle which would take them to [[Dromund Kaas]], the capital of the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]]. Since Blood did not break the tournament rules, Grataa promised to keep an eye out for the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Grataa\n|ru=\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kaleesh]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
