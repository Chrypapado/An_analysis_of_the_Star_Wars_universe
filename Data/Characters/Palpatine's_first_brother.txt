His eldest brother, known simply by the family cognomen of Palpatine, became a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] as [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] [[Darth Sidious|Sidious]], [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], and [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] of the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].\n\n==Biography==\nThe youngest Palpatines resented their elder brother, but were their father's pride, representing all that his eldest could never be. The latter considered them, in turn, \"well-behaved\" and held them in contempt for not sharing his vast ambition.\n\nThe younger Palpatine brothers were present along with their father, mother, sisters and [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]] when they took their elder brother from [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] in the [[Palpatine family starship|Palpatine family]] [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]]. After the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] left [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], Palpatine slaughtered his family, including his young brothers.\n\nPalpatine remembered the lifeless forms of his siblings slumped on the starship floor every time his Sith master, [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]], urged him to recall the murders in vivid detail as part of his training in the dark side.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']] {{1st|[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Palpatine family]]\n[[Category:Unidentified brothers]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified nobility]]"}}}]}}}}
