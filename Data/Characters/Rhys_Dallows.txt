He trained under [[Essara Till/Legends|Essara Till]] and passed his final test easily. When Rhys began to develop feelings for Essara, she was [[Death/Legends|killed]] - in only their first [[mission]] together. Rhys swore revenge, and eventually tracked down Essara's killer. Rhys joined up with [[Bravo Flight/Legends|Bravo Squadron]] as Bravo 10 and went on a mission to destroy the receiver stations on a Trade Federation space station - the mission turned into a disastrous ambush when the mercenary ship that had killed Essara appeared. Rhys eventually managed to destroy him and flew out just in time-because then the whole space station exploded from the inside.\n\n==Biography==\nAs a young man, Rhys joined the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]] and was assigned to [[Bravo Flight/Legends|Bravo Squadron]]. He was placed under the tutelage of Essara Till, daughter of a prominent Naboo government official. He proved a quick learner even though he probably didn't read the Combat Manual cover-to-cover. After passing Essara's tests in her favorite training canyon, he was picked by her to be her wingman during an upcoming Royal Escort mission. Bravo Flight was to protect the [[J-type 327 Nubian royal starship|Royal Starship]] while [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Amidala]] negotiated with the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] about the blockade. It was supposed to be an easy run, but an attack by several mercenaries flying [[Dagger-class starfighter|Dagger]], [[MorningStar]], and [[Dianoga-class assault starfighter|Dianoga]]-class starfighters forced the rookie space jockey to fight for his life. In the end the Queen escaped, but Rhys' [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighter]] was badly damaged and Essara was killed by a late mercenary arrival.\n\nFortunately, Rhys was saved by a [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]] salvager named [[Reti]], who took him to the base of mercenary [[Vana Sage]] for a serious overhaul of his fighter. After rescuing Vana from her own prison cell Rhys learned that the Trade Federation was definitely behind the attempt on the Queen's life, and that it was building a [[Trade Federation Droid Army/Legends|Droid Army]] from a massive factory on [[Eos]]. With the aid Vana, Reti, and [[Nym/Legends|Nym]], a [[Feeorin/Legends|Feeorin]] pirate captain with an experimental bomber and a major grudge against the Federation, he set out to destroy the Eos factory. When they reached Eos the team split into two groups: Vana and Nym headed down to hit the foundries while Rhys and Reti lured away the planet's defense squadrons of Scarabs and Droid Starfighters with attacks on orbital satellites and Federation freighters. The attack was a success, but Rhys soon learned that the Trade Federation had launched its attack on Naboo.\n\nBy the time they had arrived, Naboo had fallen, but a Resistance movement had already begun and Rhys was quick to join-up. His first mission was to escort Reti and his load of munitions to a Resistance base, but a Trade Federation army ruined the party and Rhys had to use his N-1 as a ground attack craft inside the tight confines of the canyons&mdash;not something the N-1 was built to do&mdash;to save the base. After this he was assigned to lead a flight of N-1s providing air cover for a group of rescue boats attempting to break-out Naboo citizens from Trade Federation concentration camps. Between the gunboats, turrets, droid starfighters, bombers, and a [[Dropship/Legends|dropship]] full of [[Armored Assault Tank]]s, it wasn't easy, but Rhys nevertheless prevailed.\n\nAfter a quick appearance over the main Resistance base to give Nym the breathing room he needed to demolish the huge Federation army attacking the place, Rhys joined-up with the remainder of Bravo Flight for a last-ditch assault on the droid control ship. It was a desperate battle, a few inexperienced Naboo pilots in ships designed for dogfighting against waves upon waves of computerized starfighters and the deadly array of weaponry aboard the enemy command ship. By concentrating on destroying the receiver dish stations needed to launch fighters, Bravo Flight had managed to gain a little room to maneuver when the same mercenary that had killed Essara Till appeared on the scene. After a brief battle, the mercenary ducked inside the enemy hangar when the shields were lowered to launch a lander. Bravo Flight followed, but only Rhys was able to get inside before the shields were raised again. Alone, in a tight space, and with all the fighters and tanks yet to embark training their guns on him along with a mercenary planning to finish him off, Rhys' chances were looking pretty slim. Amazingly, he not only survived, but managed to demolish a huge amount of war materiel, kill the mercenary to avenge Essara, and escape the exploding warship courtesy of a few well-placed shots to the vessel's portside power grid.\n\nAlthough Vana had agreed to stay on Naboo after the battle, Nym soon left to deliver a shipment of supplies to his men. However, the Feeorin did stay long enough to tell Rhys that if he ever got tired of working in paradise, he knew who to call. Besides his friendship with Vana, Reti, and Nym, Rhys was close to his astromech, an R2 unit named [[Wrench (R2 unit)|Wrench]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:RhysDallowsSWG.jpg|200px|thumb|Rhys Dallows cut depiction from ''Star Wars Galaxies'']]\nDallows was voiced by [[Darren Scott]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{GamerCite|1|The Starfighter Trap}} {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] {{Retcon}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Starfighter]]''\n*[[Starfighter: Crossbones 1|''Starfighter: Crossbones'' 1]] {{Flash}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|50|Pushing the Limits of the Star Wars Universe}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=starwars/article.asp?x=starfighter_stats|text=\"The Starfighter Trap\" Character Statistics|int=The Starfighter Trap|archivedate=20041012235945}}\n*{{GamerCite|2|Star Wars Starfighter: Starfighter Aces}}\n*''[[Starfighter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|53|Gamescape}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/guides.vm?id=80113|text=[[CorSec Database H-Z]]|archivedate=20060719111959}} <!-- 2006-06-16 -->\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galaxy of Intrigue]]''\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=68996&month=112010|text=Friday Feature \u2013 Factions in the Galaxy|archivedate=20111124003412}}\n*{{DB|character|nym|Nym|archivedate=20100330013717}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rhys Dallows\n|it=Rhys Dallows\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dallows, Rhys}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Royal Naboo Security Force personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
