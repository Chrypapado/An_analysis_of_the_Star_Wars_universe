Nevertheless, he participated in the [[Battle of Kashyyyk]], serving as a gunner aboard an [[Oevvaor Jet Catamaran]] piloted by [[Zittaasabba]] and [[Wullffwarro]]. The old Wookiee threw [[thermal detonator]]s at the enemy, having practiced his throw in virtual-reality games played on a [[mind evaporator]] headest.<ref name=\"Complete Vehicles 2018\">[[Star Wars: Complete Vehicles (2018)|''Star Wars: Complete Vehicles'']]</ref> He later went on to mentor the [[Trandoshan]] [[Doshanalawook]], daughter of [[Cradossk]] and [[clutchmate]] of [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]]. With his help, Doshanalawook eventually made a name for saving Wookiees from slavery, taking on the alias Chainbreaker.<ref name=\"FACPOV\">{{Shortstory|story=Tooth and Claw|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Itchy_art.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Early concept art of Attichitcuk]]\nAttichitcuk was first mentioned in ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]] in the [[2018]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''.

In his conceptual drawings, Johnston described Attichitcuk as a \"350-375 years old\" Wookiee. Many of Attichitcuk's characteristics can also be attributed to [[Ralph McQuarrie]], who recalled drawing \"an old Wookiee getting up out of his chair and several females and children.\"<ref name=\"Wook MU\">{{SWArchive|url=movies/saga/20081119a.html?page=2|text=Holiday Special: Lumpy Speaks - Stan Winston, Wookiee Make-up|archivedate=20091221194151}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chewies_Father-ROTS.png|thumb|right|200px|Concept art of \"Chewbacca's father\" for ''Revenge of the Sith'']]\nAround October [[2002]], Attichitcuk was to be reinvented during production of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], the [[prequel trilogy]]'s conclusion. According to concept artist [[Sang Jun Lee]], \"Chewbacca's father\" was meant to be killed during the course of the movie, which would have prompted Chewie to run away and meet Han Solo. This concept, however, didn't make it into the final film. In January [[2003]], Lucas told the creation team that a young Han Solo would be featured and that by the time of Episode III, he was being raised on Kashyyyk by Chewbacca. Eventually, both ideas were utterly abandoned.<ref name=\"TAoSWEIII:RotS\">''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Shortstory|story=Deck the Halls|book=Life Day 1|bformatted=''Life Day'' 1|manual=1}}\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel]]'' {{Mo}} {{1stID}}\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel (audiobook)|''Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=Tooth and Claw|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Tree of Life|book=Life Day Treasury}} {{1stc}}\n\n===Non-canon appearances===\n*''[[The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Vehicles (2018)|''Star Wars: Complete Vehicles'']]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Battles that Changed the Galaxy]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Attichitcuk\n|fr=Attichitcuk\n|ka=\u10d0\u10e2\u10d8\u10e9\u10d8\u10e2\u10d9\u10e3\u10d9\u10d8\n|ru=\u0410\u0442\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0443\u043a/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
