Throgg was forced to flee Tatooine and embark upon a smuggler's life just to make ends meet.\n\n[[File:Throggpanel1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Throgg sitting in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]].]]\n\nShortly after the destruction of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]] at the Battle of Yavin, [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] hero [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] returned to Tatooine to go over his late family's effects. His uncle [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen]] and aunt [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru Lars]] once owned a moisture farm just outside of the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]]. Luke knew that his responsibilities to the Alliance prevented him from managing the farm, so he used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to guide him towards someone who could benefit from ownership of the [[Lars homestead|property]]. The Force led him to [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], where he found Throgg sitting at a table in the corner. He offered him the deed to the Lars farm, but Throgg did not trust Luke's intentions. He crumpled the piece of paper up and threw it behind his shoulder, uninterested. Unrelated events forced Luke to leave the cantina, but Throgg later reconsidered the offer and recovered the deed. Despite his gruff nature, Throgg was eternally grateful for the chance to operate a moisture farm once again.\n\nIn about [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]], [[Zef Ando]], lived on the Lars Estate as a squatter.<ref name=\"SWG:TS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Tosche Station|Tatooine}}</ref> It is unknown how Throgg reacted to this.\n\nAfter a few seasons, Throgg came under the notice of [[Huff Darklighter]]. Huff wanted to monopolize the moisture farming industry on Tatooine and attempted to institute an alien landowner tax. Huff's brother [[Jula Darklighter|Jula]] intervened and purchased the Lars farm before Huff could successfully implement the tax. The more scrupulous Darklighter brother maintained the deed of ownership but allowed Throgg to continue working as a tenant.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars 3-D 1]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|location|larsmoisturefarm|Lars moisture farm|archivedate=20100203084810}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=Owner of the [[Lars homestead]]\n|years=[[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]]&ndash;[[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]\n|before=[[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]\n|after=[[Jula Darklighter]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Throgg\n}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
