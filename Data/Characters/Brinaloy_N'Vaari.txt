She was the granddaughter of the previous [[Provincial Governor]] and as such, grabbed the attention of the current [[Governor/Legends|Governor]], [[A'jidre Skrigatov]]. Despite forwarding a guise of honor, Skrigatov was simply a petty criminal, and had assassinated N'Vaari's [[N'Vaari|grandfather]] to take power. Five years later, to gain political support, Skrigatov arranged to be wed to N'Vaari.\n\nA local [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] gangster named [[Malkoi]] shared a mutual vendetta with Skrigatov, though, and arranged for N'Vaari to be kidnapped. Malkoi hoped to blackmail Skrigatov out of power and install a puppet governor.\n\nThey were both foiled when N'Vaari used her comprehensive training as an actress to impersonate a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] performer at the [[Starlight Theater]] located on [[Phyrstal Island]] in the resort city of [[Le Yer]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=No Disintegrations (West End Games)|text=''No Disintegrations''|story=Abregado-Rae Intrigue}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:N'Vaari, Brinaloy}}\n[[Category:Abregado-rae]]\n[[Category:Actors]]\n[[Category:Devaronians]]\n[[Category:Females]]"}}}]}}}}
