The head of the Darklighter Estate? He's only the biggest business magnate on Tatooine.|Huff Darklighter's guard, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Huff Darklighter''' was the [[Parent/Legends|father]] of [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]], the brother of [[Jula Darklighter]], the uncle of [[Gavin Darklighter]], and a land baron on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].\n\n==Biography==\nA native of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], Huff owned dozens of moisture farms on his home planet, and bought water from other farmers at cut-rate prices. Some of the water he used in his own hydroponics facilities, while most was sold to other settlers at a high profit. He used his ability to locate water to become one of the planet's largest food magnates. In turn, he used his wealth to make sure Biggs got everything he deserved from life.\n\nHuff was not above bribing the local officials\u2014both planetary and Imperial\u2014to maintain his stature. Huff was avidly anti-Imperial, believing they had destroyed democracy and ruled through fear, and did not approve of Biggs' choice to enlist in the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]].\n\n[[File:Huff_Darklighter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs]] confides in his father about his lack of confidence in the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].]]\nHe held his son in highest regard, and truly believed that Biggs was the only hero of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. Huff went so far as to alter say that [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] was less than a hero for leaving the battle, despite the fact that Wedge was ordered out by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, an antique [[Tusken King (rank)|Tusken King]]'s [[Tusken Cycler rifle|rifle]] that belonged to Huff Darklighter's grandfather was stolen. Huff was very upset and one of his guards hired a spacer to retrieve the rifle. The spacer traveled to [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] and managed to recover the rifle from the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Borvo|Borvo the Hutt]].<ref name=\"SWG:FHR\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Finding Huff's Rifle|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\nThe spacer later worked for Huff Darklighter. For a first mission, Huff requested the spacer to help his daughter Dera who had become obsessed with [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]]. The spacer met the woman in the [[Lowland Basin|desert]] and agreed to eradicate a tribe of vile Sand Peoples dwelling within a [[Tusken Cave|cave]] near the Darklighter estate. For a second mission, Huff asked the spacer to disrupt [[Sennex]] [[Slavery/Legends|slave trade]] operations in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. The spacer thus attacked a [[Sennex Slave Bunker|Sennex bunker]] on the outskirts of the city that posed as a research facility and killed a number of slavers. For all the services provided to his family, Huff Darklighter rewarded a polished [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]] [[Skeleton/Legends|skull]] to the spacer.<ref name=\"SWG:DE\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Darklighter Estate|Tatooine}}</ref>\n\nHuff tried to obtain ownership of the [[Lars homestead|Lars moisture farm]] on Tatooine by initiating an alien landowner tax. The tax was geared toward breaking the alien [[Throgg]]'s financial reserves, but [[Gavin Darklighter|Gavin's]] father intervened and bought the farm before Huff could enforce the tax. Huff's dealings with the Imperial prefect on Tatooine allowed him a greater latitude in his dealings, and he worked hard to keep his competition at bay. However, Huff wasn't perfect. He was tricked and swindled by [[Lirin Banolt]], but managed to obtain an Imperial data disk containing information on the [[Eidolon Base]] weapons cache. The plans were stolen from his residence, but were eventually [[Tatooine Campaign|recovered]] by [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]].\n\nHuff took control of much of the Eidolon weapons cache in the aftermath, and used some of the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] armor, repainted to dark blue, for his security forces. Much of the remaining equipment was provided to Rogue Squadron during the [[Bacta War]]. Huff attempted to start a bidding war between the Rogues and an unknown buyer represented by [[Booster Terrik]], but upon learning that his long-time friend Wedge Antilles was seeking the equipment, Booster quickly switched his allegiance. He used his knowledge of Huff's Imperial dealings to blackmail the moisture farmer into giving the weapons to Wedge. When Huff attempted to haggle over the price, Booster informed him that he meant the weapons should be given away for free, but his daughter [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Terrik]] intervened, insisting that the Rogues would buy the weapons, but only at a fair price.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the [[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope|first edition]] of ''[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope]]'', he was called \"Huk Darklighter.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Empire 8|''Empire'' 8]]\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope]]'' {{1stm}} {{C|as \"Huk Darklighter\"}}\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Star Wars Screen Entertainment]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology]]''<!--p. 21-->\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Huff Darklighter}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Huff Darklighter\n|nl=Huff Darklighter\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darklighter, Huff}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Darklighter family]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moisture farmers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
