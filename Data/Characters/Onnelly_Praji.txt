I'll get daddy to buy me a new set when we arrive at Byss.|Onnelly Praji|Evasive Action: Recruitment}}\n'''Onnelly Praji''' was the daughter of [[Tannon Praji]], the [[First Minister (Coruscant Ministry of Ingress)|First Minister]] of the [[Coruscant Ministry of Ingress/Legends|Coruscant Ministry of Ingress]]. In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], [[Gender/Legends|she]] and her [[House Praji/Legends|family]] were to be relocated to the \"[[Emerald Splendor Estates]]\" on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] for a short [[Time/Legends|time]] as part of a recolonization effort. While preparing for departure, Onnelly met [[Drake Lo'gaan|Jodd Sonta]], a [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order/Legends|Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]] [[Sub-Adult Group/Legends|Sub-Adult Group]] member. She later encountered Sonta once more as her [[Transport/Legends|transport]] was preparing to depart for Byss. Sonta, who was actually the fugitive [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Drake Lo'gaan, informed her that the transport was a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. Despite his warning, Onnelly went to Byss with her family and had her [[The Force/Legends|Force]] energy slowly drained by [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] himself, who used the world as a private retreat.\n\n==Biography==\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Onnelly Praji was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] to [[Tannon Praji|Tannon]] and [[Maree Praji]], members of the influential [[House Praji/Legends|House Praji]]; Tannon, in particular, was the [[First Minister (Coruscant Ministry of Ingress)|First Minister]] of the [[Coruscant Ministry of Ingress/Legends|Coruscant Ministry of Ingress]], the agency that monitored [[The galaxy/Legends|the galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant's]] immigration and emigration. In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] came to power, Tannon took leave of his job to help relocate Onnelly and Maree to the \"[[Emerald Splendor Estates]]\" on the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Byss/Legends|Byss]]. The relocation was part of a much broader \"recolonization effort,\" intended to attract the wealthy and powerful.<ref name=\"ttsp\" /> Despite this, Onnelly believed they would only be there for approximately a [[Standard month/Legends|month]]. Before departure, Onnelly traveled to [[Transport/Legends|transport]] platform [[DN6-4435]] to help load her family's luggage on board the [[Starship/Legends|craft]] bound for \"Emerald Splendor.\"<ref name=\"ea:r\" />\n\nOnnelly was having difficulty with the bag [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsors]] and asked for help from a young boy in the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order/Legends|Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]] [[Sub-Adult Group/Legends|Sub-Adult Group]] who was passing by. The boy obliged and began carrying all the bags by himself at once. The two began conversing, and Onnelly asked the boy about his family, only to discover that they had died in the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. The boy claimed that he had joined COMPNOR for the [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], and that he hoped to find out if any of his family had survived. When he had finished loading the bags, Onnelly introduced herself, and the boy identified himself as [[Drake Lo'gaan|Jodd Sonta]], although he was hesitant to do so. Onnelly noticed this, but let it pass, giving Sonta a kiss on the cheek before departing.<ref name=\"ea:r\" />\n\nWhen the transport finally prepared to depart, Onnelly was approached by Sonta once again&mdash;this time, the boy was wearing battle armor. He quickly explained to her that the possessions of the non-[[Human/Legends|Humans]] aboard the transport were being destroyed, and that the Imperials were not going to let anyone off the transport. Sonta attempted to lead her off the transport, but Onnelly resisted, as she did not understand. He explained the situation to her bluntly&mdash;the transport was a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] ship, and Onnelly was unlikely to ever return from \"Emerald Splendor.\" At that moment, [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]] [[Antinnis Tremayne]]&mdash;flanked by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]]&mdash;entered the room, intending to arrest Sonta. The boy was in fact a Jedi, Drake Lo'gaan, who had escaped the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Jedi purge]] of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] some time prior and was acting undercover. In response to Tremayne's arrival, Lo'gaan used his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to break open a nearby window and jumped off the transport.<ref name=\"ea:r\" />\n\nDespite Lo'gaan's warning, Onnelly accompanied her family to \"Emerald Splendor.\" In reality, the world was [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] private retreat. While there, Onnelly, Maree, and others like them were kept entertained, but unknown to them, Palpatine was secretly sapping away at their [[The Force/Legends|Force]] energy in order to keep himself sustained.<ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThe [[Color/Legends|black]]-haired Onnelly Praji was not adverse to performing menial tasks, such as loading luggage by herself, but could not do so without the assistance of repulsorlift technology. She was reliant on her father's ability to buy her what she wanted and needed, and she expected as much when her current possessions somehow failed her. Onnelly was also flirtatious when it came to her encounter with Drake Lo'gaan; Lo'gaan himself, having been trained as a Jedi, found it difficult to resist striking up a relationship with the girl.<ref name=\"ea:r\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOnnelly Praji first appeared in the [[Paul Ens]] webstrip ''[[Evasive Action: Recruitment]]'' as a minor supporting character. Her relationship to another ''[[Star Wars]]'' character, Tannon Praji, was established in the article ''[[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Evasive Action: Recruitment]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/source/praji/20090205.html|text=Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji|int=Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Onnelly Praji\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Praji, Onnelly}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:House Praji]]"}}}]}}}}
