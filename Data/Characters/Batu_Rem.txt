He served under the command of [[Dol Grenn]]. When Rem went on leave, he was replaced by [[False Batu Rem|an impostor]] who assumed his name.\n\nShortly after the security cameras short out, the imposter came over to the [[Meetra Surik]]'s force cage and deactivated it, along with her companions', to kill the three of them. He failed and was discovered as an imposter by Grenn and the rest of the TSF Officers. Surik later found out that the latter arrived to Telos via a [[tramp freighter]] from [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Batu Rem\n|fr=Batu Rem\n|pl=Batu Rem\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rem, Batu}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Judicial Department personnel]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
