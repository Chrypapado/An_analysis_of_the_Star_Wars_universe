There he owned a diner, well known to provide hearty meals to tired travelers. He was forced to pay [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] to allow himself and his business to survive.\n\nShortly before [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] arrived at Mos Eisley, a group of Rebels delivered a [[Datacard/Legends|datacard]] from [[Thel Erelen]] on [[Duro/Legends|Duro]] to the Whiphid. When he fell behind his protection money, he got their assistance in confronting the Hutt's hired thugs. Not long afterward, his establishment was searched by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] looking for an old spacer and his [[R4]] unit. The [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] had come to Tatooine, searching for [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]].\n\nIn [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], following Jabba's death, Jun sent Rebel agents into [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] to recover as much of the crime lord's intelligence files as could be found.\n\nDishes served at his diner included [[womp rat stew]] (sometimes called \"mystery stew\"), [[eopie brisket]]s and [[Bantha steak/Legends|bantha steaks]]. He often hired hands to hunt wild animals, in order to use their meat for his dishes. He claimed to have employed virtually every adventurer and [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who had ever passed through Tatooine.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNeither Jun Seros nor his diner are actually seen in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', however a player can obtain his missions to hunt womp rats from the mission terminals on Tatooine.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jun Seros\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seros, Jun}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Chefs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Whiphids]]"}}}]}}}}
