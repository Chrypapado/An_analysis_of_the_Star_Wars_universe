At this point, LS-121 had been with the Cartel for some time, and was well versed in the organization and assignments of Cartel personnel. When the [[Cularin resistance]] successfully attacked the jungle base, they captured the base's guards and other personnel and escorted them out before the base was destroyed by a [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolaser]] bombardment from above.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Revelation]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Metatheran Cartel members]]\n[[Category:Protocol droids]]"}}}]}}}}
