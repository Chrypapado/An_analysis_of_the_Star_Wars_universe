He also created the [[Painting/Legends|paintings]] known as ''[[Feared]]'' and [[Fighter (painting)|''Fighter'']].\n\n==Biography==\nOb Khaddor was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], a [[Planet/Legends|planet]] where [[Artist/Legends|artists]] and philosophers proliferated. In his youth, Khaddor joined the renowned [[University of Alderaan/Legends|University of Alderaan]], one of the most ancient and prestigious places of learning in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], where he built himself a reputation as a troublemaker and a radical. He became a [[Grass painting|grass painter]], a botanical artist who created giant works of art by managing the growth of various [[Species/Legends|species]] of [[Grass/Legends|grass]].<ref name=\"ISWU\" /> One of his most famous works was the ''[[Killik Twilight]]'', a [[Moss painting/Legends|moss painting]] that depicted the [[Killik/Legends|Killik]], an ancient [[Species/Legends|race]] that had once inhabited Alderaan. That [[Painting/Legends|painting]] was hung in the [[Aldera Royal Palace|Royal Palace]] of [[Aldera/Legends|Aldera]], outside the bedroom of the young [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].<ref name=\"TUF\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref>\n\nOne [[Standard day/Legends|day]], Khaddor was told that the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] planned a stopover on Alderaan. The artist, who had made himself famous for his overt anti-Imperial sentiments, campaigned so he would be authorized to create a painting that would \"commemorate\" the imminent arrival of Emperor. When Palpatine arrived on the site, he could behold a magnificent, extremely flattering portrait; however, Ob Khaddor had played a trick on the Empire. The artist had arranged things so that carefully planted [[Black lily|black lilies]] would spread open, making it look like as if the Emperor's skin was decayed and rotten.<ref name=\"ISWU\" />\n\nA very infuriated Palpatine ordered the whole grassplain to burned down, and the [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Prestor Organa]] apologized personally in feigned indignation. Ob Khaddor, however, did not suffer the consequences of his mockery, as he had secretly left the planet before the arrival of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] delegation. Subsequently, the Empire put a [[Death mark/Legends|death mark]] on Khaddor, and numerous [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] got on his track. However, Ob Khaddor's ultimate whereabouts were still unknown following the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of Alderaan in the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. In a report she wrote about her defunct [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], the Alderaanian [[Poet/Legends|poetess]] [[Hari Seldona]] mentioned Khaddor at great length.<ref name=\"ISWU\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKhaddor's name is misspelled '''Ob Khaddar''' in ''[[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe]]'', ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Tatooine Ghost]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe]]'' {{1stm}}\n*{{FFCite|18|ALD4, ''Alderaan''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ob Khaddor\n|nl=Ob Khaddar\n|pl=Ob Khaddor\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khaddor, Ob}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
