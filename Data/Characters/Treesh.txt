He was responsible for keeping the tribe's soldiers armed with the best weapons he could muster.\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1.5 ABY, a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] with the knowledge to craft weapons visited Treesh within the Myyydril Caverns and asked him to teach them what he knew. Treesh agreed to teach the spacer how to craft [[Nak'tra crystal]] knives. Unfortunately, Treesh had no crystals at the moment, so he set the spacer on the task of collecting fifteen of the crystals from the corpses of the [[Urnsor'is]] that infested the cavern. After the spacer had collected them, they brought them back to Treesh, who proceeded to teach the spacer how to make the knives.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTreesh is a non-playable character in the massively-multiplayer online role-playing game [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']]. He was added to the game, along with the planet Kashyyyk, in the [[2005]] expansion pack, [[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees|''Rage of the Wookiees'']].\n\nTreesh's quest is only available to players of the Trader (Munitions) profession within the game.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Rage of the Wookiees}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Artisans]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
