I took their orders for a long time.|Kasan Moor, on her defection|Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)}}\n'''Kasan Moor''' was an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE interceptor]] pilot and flew as the [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] of the elite [[128th TIE Interceptor Squadron]]. Following the destruction of her homeworld, [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], by the Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]], Moor grew something of a hatred for the Empire and would [[Defection|defect]] to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] during the Alliance's [[Liberation of Gerrard V|liberation]] of [[Gerrard V]].\n\nMoor's knowledge of Imperial installations and her exceptional piloting skills were reason for her induction into [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Flight]], an Alliance [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] unit led by [[Lieutenant Commander/Legends|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. Flying under the callsign [[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]], Moor led the Alliance through a string of several victorious hit and run operations against various Imperial bases. Following her assistance in bringing down [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Kohl Seerdon]], Moor retired from being an active member of Rogue Flight to be an advisor to [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], [[Chief/Legends|Chief]] of the Rebel Alliance. She would once more fly with the Rogues during the [[Battle of Calamari]] years later.\n\n==Biography==\n===Imperial pilot===\nAs a pilot for the Empire, Moor rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] and, after proving her prowess, was given command of the [[128th TIE Interceptor Squadron]], which [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] member [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]] later referred to as \"the best of the best.\" One of her known activities with the group during her time with the Empire was to find potential candidates for Imperial takeover on the [[Gas giant/Legends|gas giant]] [[Taloraan/Legends|Taloraan]].<ref name=\"rs\" /> Moor and the 128th were so well regarded that both she and the squadron were mentioned as an example of what the best pilots and machines can do in the official ''[[Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide]]''.\n\nHer views on the Empire changed following the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of her home planet, [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], by the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]]. After she was assigned to put down a [[Liberation of Gerrard V|rebel uprising]] on the planet [[Gerrard V]], Kasan's TIE Interceptor's controls were damaged by repeated [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]] blasts from [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Gold Squadron]] member [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]]. When Madine forced Moor to surrender herself, Moor admitted her quarrels with the ideals of the Empire, and offered defection to the Alliance.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\n===Work with Rogue Squadron===\n{{Quote|How pathetic, allying yourself with those Rebel criminals&mdash;Rogue Squadron. You and your so-called Rogues helped in the absconding of my AT-PTs ''and'' the plundering of my Research Facility. My retaliation shall be swift and just&hellip;Do you no longer harbor any loyalty to our Emperor? Defecting to the rebel terrorists shall be your undoing, Kasan. Unfortunate to lose such a fine officer, but the weak will die out to make room for the strong. It is the way of the universe. Farewell, little rodent.|Moff Seerdon, to Kasan Moor|Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)}}\n[[File:Kasantiey.jpg|thumb|left|Kasan's TIE Interceptor is disabled at Gerrard V.]]\nKasan was taken to Rebel service during the [[Liberation of Gerrard V]] by one of [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine's]] [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-wings]]. Moor donated her TIE interceptor to the [[Alliance Fleet]], and offered her knowledge of Imperial installations to [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Flight]],<ref name=\"RS/RF\" /> led by [[Lieutenant Commander/Legends|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. Due to her knowledge and prowess as a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] pilot, Moor was inducted into the group as Rogue Seven. Her knowledge was used to lead a [[Battle of the Jade Moon|raid]] on an Imperial storage facility on the [[Jade Moon]]. Rogue pilot [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] did not trust Moor, but Moor continued to prove her allegiance by assisting the Rogues in attacks on [[Raid on Balmorra|Balmorra]] and [[Assault on Kile II|Kile II]].<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nMoor took part in the [[Rescue on Kessel|rescue]] of Antilles from the Imperial prisons on [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] following his capture on Kile II. With the Rogues again at full strength, Moor assisted in attacks on Taloraan and [[Fest/Legends|Fest]], raids which were aimed at reducing the resources of Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Kohl Seerdon]], who was amassing his forces for a massive attack on the Alliance's [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] supply on the jungle world [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]]. She confronted Seerdon directly during Seerdon's retaliatory attack on [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], homeworld of one of the Alliance's founders, [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]]. Seerdon insisted that her defection to the Rebellion would be her undoing, and was a waste of her prowess. While Moor was intent on pursuing Seerdon, Luke Skywalker persuaded her otherwise.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nMoor's knowledge led to another [[Raid on Sullust|raid]] on Imperial territory, this time on the [[Capacitor (Sullust)|Capacitor]] on the volcanic planet of [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]]. Seerdon had used this raid to his advantage, and used the time that the Rebellion was focused on Sullust to achieve his goal of seizing the Alliance's supply of bacta on Thyferra. Moor took part in the battle to reclaim the bacta. During the battle, her [[X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing starfighter]] was shot down by Imperial forces, but she managed to survive the crash-landing.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\n===Later activity===\nIt is believed that Moor retired from her service with the Rogues sometime before the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]] in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]]. She would remain a member of the Rebel Alliance, acting as an advisor to Mon Mothma, [[General/Legends|General]] Crix Madine, and [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]], and continued to use her knowledge of Imperial operations to aid the fledgling Rebellion.<ref name=\"wtfhappned\">{{Blog|RyanKaufman|23|What Happened to Kasan Moor?|Look, sir! Zombies!|Ryan Kaufman (author)|archivedate=20060329215814}}</ref>\n\nYears later, Moor flew with the Rogues again during the [[Battle of Calamari]].<ref name=\"rs\" /> This was done as a personal favor for Wedge Antilles, who was promoted to [[Rogue Leader/Legends|Rogue Leader]] following the retirement of Luke Skywalker. Since she was not an \"official\" member of the group during the battle, no [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] records describe her participation during the battle.<ref name=\"wtfhappned\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKasan Moor was voiced by [[Olivia Hussey]].

Zombies!|Ryan Kaufman (author)|archivedate=20110916142432}}</ref>\n\nWriter [[Ryan Kaufman (author)|Ryan Kaufman]] jokingly described Moor as being thrown into the \"La Brea Tar Pits\" of secondary videogame characters, as she was created solely for the game [[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)|''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'']] and has barely appeared in any source material since. He offered insight into what Moor's life was like between the [[Battle of Thyferra (5 ABY)|attack on Thyferra]] and the Battle of Mon Calamari.<ref name=\"wtfhappned\" />\n\nDespite showing up with Rogue Squadron in [[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption|''Forces of Corruption'']], there are no female vocals as part of that hero unit&mdash;her audio consists of [[Dak Ralter/Legends|Dak Ralter's]] lines dubbed from [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']].<ref name=\"FOC\">''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (video game)|''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron: The Official Nintendo Player's Guide]]''\n*{{SWPM|set=Scum & Villainy|link=http://www.swpocketmodels.com/images/shipsv05c.jpg|cardname=128th Squadron TIE Interceptor}}\n*{{FFCite|21}} {{C|SKY10, ''Luke Skywalker''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*<!-- 2014/10/20 -->''[[Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Blog|RyanKaufman|23|What Happened to Kasan Moor?|Look, sir!
