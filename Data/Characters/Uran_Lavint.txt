She owned a ship called the ''[[Breathe My Jets]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nLavint owed money to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Blatta]] and he became her co-pilot during a large smuggling operation consisting of a small fleet. They were captured by the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']] after Uran sold them out to the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] to pay her debts. Later she would ask [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] for any other assignments, which he refused. She then asked for her ship to be given back to her, which request was also refused and she was saddled instead with a [[YV-666 light freighter/Legends|YV-666 light freighter]] called the ''[[Duracrud]]''. She resented this and didn't know that Solo had ordered her [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] to be sabotaged after she had insulted him so that her hyperdrive would only work once.\n\nAfter she jumped to an empty place, she failed to repair the hyperdrive. However, [[Alema Rar]] had stowed away in the hold and helped her repair the hyperdrive in exchange for Lavint helping Alema to find the Solos. Uran brought Alema to the ''[[Errant Venture]]'' to find the Solos, while there, Lavint gambled, sometimes with the aid of Alema, and drank often. Once while drunk, Jacen approached her again in order to smuggle him to a secret meeting of the [[Confederation]] at [[Gilatter VIII]]. She agreed after Jacen gave her a new ship, a [[Gallofree Yards, Inc./Legends|Gallofree Yards]] medium transport. Later Alema would steal the ''Duracrud'' to escape the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Uran Lavint\n|es=Uran Lavint\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lavint, Uran}}\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
