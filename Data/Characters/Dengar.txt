I can't believe I'm gettin' ''paid'' for this!|Dengar, heading into battle|Star Wars Battlefront}}\n'''Dengar''', also known as '''Dengar the Demolisher''', was a [[Corellia]]n [[human]] [[bounty hunter]] operating since the early stages of the [[Clone Wars]]. Dengar participated in an [[Safe cargo objective|operation]] on [[Quarzite]]&mdash;during which he served as a member of [[Krayt's Claw]], a syndicate of hunters including [[Boba Fett]], [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], and [[Asajj Ventress]]&mdash;to secure property valuable to Lord [[Otua Blank]] of the planet Quarzite. Dengar also took jobs for clients such as the [[Grand Hutt Council]], fighting against [[Maul]] and his [[Shadow Collective]] on [[Nal Hutta]].\n\nDengar remained active through the [[Galactic Civil War]], during which he was one of several bounty hunters hired by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to capture [[Han Solo]], captain of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Though Dengar ultimately lost Vader's bounty to his rival and partner Boba Fett, he was later present with Bossk and Fett in [[Jabba's Palace]] on Tatooine during Solo's rescue by [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]].\n\nDengar's impressive longevity led him to continue his work as a bounty hunter even after the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Endor]]. Around a year later, he teamed up with other tenured hunters such as [[Embo]] when he joined [[Jas Emari]] and her [[Jas Emari's crew|crew]] after the [[Battle of Jakku]].\n\n==Biography==\n===The Clone Wars===\n====Safe cargo objective====\n{{Quote|So... what do you think is in that box?''\"<br />\"''Whatever it is, it better be worth all this effort.|Dengar and Asajj Ventress contemplate the contents of the box|Bounty (episode)}}\nDengar was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] from the [[planet]] [[Corellia]].<ref name=\"Galactic Defense\" /> Before Dengar became a [[bounty hunter]], he served as a [[gladiator]].<ref name=\"Scum and Villainy\">''[[Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious]]''</ref> Dengar's bounty hunter career was considered to be at its prime during [[the galaxy]]-wide [[Clone Wars]] conflict, during which he attained a remarkable track record. He was part of an [[Safe cargo objective|operation]] alongside fellow hunters [[Boba Fett]], [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], [[Latts Razzi]], [[C-21 Highsinger]], and [[Oked]]. The hunters were hired to escort a [[subtram]] containing [[Pluma Sodi|cargo]] valuable to [[Otua Blank]], the leader of the [[Belugan]] people of [[Quarzite]]. While preparing for the mission in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], Oked was [[Death|murdered]] by the wayward [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] user [[Asajj Ventress]], who promptly agreed to take the dead hunter's place on the mission roster.<ref name=\"Bounty\" />\n\n[[File:DengarKageFight-Bounty.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dengar fights a Kage Warrior]]\nDengar and company set off in Bossk's [[Starship|ship]], the ''[[Hound's Tooth]]'', to Quarzite, where the Belugan [[Major]] [[Rigosso]] transported the team to the train's subterranean loading dock via a space [[Turbolift|elevator]] from an orbital skyhook. Dengar, along with Ventress, were assigned to guard the rear of the train. After unsuccessfully flirting with Ventress, a team of skilled [[Kage Warriors]] boarded the train in an attempt to retrieve the cargo. Dengar managed to fight off many of the attackers due to his skilled [[hand-to-hand combat]] techniques, and even managed to kill two using [[sticky explosive]]s. Dengar was eventually overwhelmed by the attackers and was thrown from the train, landing safely on the subterranean surface. Dengar and his allies, who were likewise thrown from the train, returned to the skyhook to await Ventress, who had betrayed the mission objective by swapping the cargo with Boba Fett, who was bound and gagged. Before departing, she hands over the rest of the team's share of unmarked [[credit]]s.<ref name=\"Bounty\" />\n\n====Working for the Hutts====\n{{Quote|Come on, let's get out of here.|Latts Razzi, to her team after their job for the Hutts went south|Eminence (episode)}}\n[[File:Crime_Lord_SWDConv.png|thumb|right|250px|Dengar was a patron of the Hutts]]\nDengar was later employed by the [[Hutt]]s alongside Latts, [[Embo]], and [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]] as protection on [[Nal Hutta]].

However, Fett was gone by the time Dengar and Valance arrived. Dengar then spoke with [[Devono Vix]]. Valance punched Vix and Dengar tried to convince him to reveal Fett's whereabouts. Vix refused and ordered both him and Valance to be killed. The two of them fought Vix's thugs and then pursued him. When Valance ran into Chewbacca, Dengar went into a tavern for a drink. He was then strangled by Chewbacca, due to their previous encounter on Nar Shadaa. He tried to shoot the Wookiee, but was tossed at C-3PO. He woke up when Chewbacca left Valance to continue his search for Solo. Due to Valance's interrogation of Vix, Dengar and Valance were able to learn that Crimson Dawn had Solo and Fett was going after them. Dengar refused to believe him about Crimson Dawn's return until Vix was killed. Dengar saved Valance from an assassin.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunters 13\">[[Bounty Hunters 13|''Bounty Hunters'' 13]]</ref>\n\nDengar and Valance were able to lose the assassin. Dengar took Valance to mechanic Mama [[Stammoch]] and her crew. As Valance was being fixed up, Dengar contacted [[Bib Fortuna]] about [[Manaroo]]'s status. Fortuna threatened to have her fed to the Rancor if he did not collect the bounty on Fett. Dengar learned about Crimson Dawn's origins from Stammoch. After Valance recovered, Dengar showed Stammoch a hologram of the assassin, who she recognized as [[Deathstick]]. Dengar then came under attack by Deathstick who killed Stammoch and her crew. The two bounty hunters were able to make their escape in a speeder by throwing a thermal detonator at Deathstick. Unfortunately, the speeder was not fixed and Dengar was saved from the crash when Valance grabbed him and jumped to safety.

Swift wanted to collect the [[Black Sun]] crime boss [[Gyuti]]'s bounty on the [[Zabrak]] [[Jas Emari]], the niece of the hunter Sugi. In the past, Dengar had once worked with Sugi, who had always hated Dengar. Dengar in turn was unpopular among many of his fellow bounty hunters including Swift. After learning that the Hutt crime lady [[Niima]] had taken Jas captive, Dengar and his fellow bounty hunters traveled to Niima's temple of the [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] world of [[Jakku]] to take Jas into custody.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nHowever, Jas escaped from her captors and wounded Swift. She then managed to convince Embo, who was a friend of her aunt Sugi, to allow her to escape in Swift's [[Corellian shuttle]]. Dengar rushed back to the ship to apprehend her but was unable to stop Jas from escaping. After Jas returned with her friend [[Norra Wexley]] and the [[B1-series battle droid]] [[Mister Bones]] to Niima's temple, Dengar and his fellow hunters cornered Niima and Jas. Niima had earlier agreed to provide Jas and Norra with Imperial uniforms, an Imperial shuttle, and clearance codes to enter the [[Main Imperial base]] on Jakku out of gratitude for ferrying her back to her temple.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nNiima initially refused to hand over Jas and grabbed Swift by the neck. However, Dengar pointed his blaster at Niima's throat and forced the Hutt to give up Jas. While the hunters were preoccupied, Norra and Bones escaped on the Imperial shuttle.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n====Teaming up with Jas Emari====\n{{Quote|Times, they are a-changing, my little gompers.

Swift wanted to depart for Nar Shaddaa to hand Jas to Gyuti but was forced to delay his departure due to the Battle of Jakku. While Jeeta landed the ship in a canyon, Jas tormented Swift. Dengar then demanded that Swift tell them his plan.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nWhen an enraged Swift struck Jas, Dengar mocked Swift, who had sustained a facial scar from Jas' horns. Despite Swift's objections, Dengar indicated that he was willing to listen to Jas' counter-offer. Dengar and Embo reacted positively to Jas' offer that the New Republic would reward them for helping to capture the Imperial [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], the alleged mastermind behind the Liberation Day attacks. When Dengar opined that working for the New Republic was not exactly \"cozy-making,\" Jas promised to secure them full pardons if they worked with her. Jas also promised to share the money with Dengar and Embo.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nSwift tried to reassert his authority but Dengar countered that he and Embo did not like him. Dengar clubbed Swift in the head with his blaster. Swift managed to grab Jas by the neck and take her hostage. However, the Zabrak headbutted Swift and then punched him in the middle before throwing him out of the shuttle's door. Disliking Swift and accepting Jas' offer, Dengar complimented her. Embo also expressed agreement. Jeeta, who was piloting the ship, also agreed to to work for Jas. Jas and [[Jas Emari's crew|her new crew]] then flew to the [[Jakku Observatory]] where they evacuated Norra.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nThe Battle of Jakku ultimately ended the [[Galactic Civil War]] as a New Republic victory. Following the signing of the [[Galactic Concordance]], Jas managed to secure Dengar, Embo, and Jeeta full pardons and some money from the New Republic. While it was not a huge sum, the money was enough to stop them from killing her and to convince Dengar and his fellow hunters to continue working as Jas' crew.

His confidence translated into his battle tactics, often taking the fight to the enemy head on with sheer firepower and destruction, which contrasted with the more cunning tactics of hunters like [[Cad Bane]] and Boba Fett.
