This contradicted several other canon sources that claim only nine Gamorreans worked in the palace. This was further contradicted by the fact that [[Jubnuk/Legends|Jubnuk]], [[Thug]], [[Thok (Gamorrean guard)|Thok]], [[Warlug]], [[Ghana Gleemort/Legends|Ghana Gleemort]], and [[Grissom (Gamorrean)|Grissom]] were not in the [[Video game|game]], suggesting that a total of nineteen Gamorrean guards worked in Jabba's palace.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
