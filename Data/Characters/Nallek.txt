Mudlicker.|Nallek|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Nallek''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] and a veteran of the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe became a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] in the wake of the conflict's end, joining up with a group of [[Azkul's mercenaries|veterans]] under the leadership of theformer [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith trooper]] [[Azkul]]. He traveled to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] with the group, which had been paid by the [[Exchange]] to take over the [[Khoonda]] government by killing [[Administrator/Legends|Administrator]] [[Terena Adare]]. When [[Meetra Surik]] visited the mercenary camp while on the [[Grass/Legends|grassy]], [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] looking for [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vrook Lamar]], he attempted to insult her by calling her a \"mudlicker.\"\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Exile can either respond to the insult with one of her own, which causes Nallek to become hostile and attack, or persuade him to talk and give information on the mercenaries using [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Neither action earns [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]] or [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points.\n\nIt is likely, though unconfirmed, that Nallek was killed during the [[Battle of Khoonda]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nallek\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Sith minions]]"}}}]}}}}
