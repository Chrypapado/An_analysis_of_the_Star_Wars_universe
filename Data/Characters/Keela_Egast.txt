What kind of Headhunters are those? Standard Z-95s or AF-series?|Keela Egast|The Starfighter Trap}}\n'''Keela Egast''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] in the [[Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps/Legends|Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps]]' [[Echo Flight]].<ref name=\"The Starfighter Trap\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===Briefing===\nIn [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], she, along with twelve other pilots, was chosen to participate in a [[Battle at TFP-9|battle]] over [[Station TFP-9]] which was under attack by pirates in [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunters]] coming from a [[Hornet-class carrier]]. She would fly in a [[N-X Police Cruiser/Legends|N-X Police Cruiser]] as [[Echo Eight (Echo Flight)|Echo Eight]]. She would be watched over by [[Bravo Flight/Legends|Bravo{{'s}}]] [[Bravo Seven|Seven]], [[Essara Till/Legends|Essara Till]], and [[Bravo Eight]], [[Dren Melne]], who secretly sought to steal her cruiser along with a couple of others and two [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighters]] for [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Challep]] of [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]].<ref name=\"The Starfighter Trap\" />\n\n===The Battle===\nOnce the fighters arrived, both squadrons engaged the first [[Squadron/Legends|squadron]] of Z-95s and were easily dealt with, however, her flight group was soon was attacked by another squad of Z-95s armed with [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missiles]] which was followed by [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sorran]] of the second carrier ''[[Velumina]]'' who demanded their surrender. It was then Dren Melne betrayed both Till and Echo flight and engaged both [[Echo One]], [[Evenyl Yob]], and [[Echo Two|Two]], [[Kerl]]. Dren promised to spare the lives of the pilots if they surrendered their fighters, but Keela called him out on what she initially thought was Kerl{{'s}} death and continued to fight until her cruiser was soon disabled by Dren and was out of contact, but ultimately the battle ended in victory after it became clear that Dren was unable to deliver his promise and was killed by Sorran. She was one of Echo Flight{{'s}} five pilots who survived when [[Technician/Legends|technicians]] recovered her fighter and received medical treatment. Essara Till then gave her name, along with [[Rhys Dallows]] and Evenyl Yob to [[Ric Oli\u00e9/Legends|Ric Oli\u00e9]] as a recommendation for a position in [[Bravo Flight/Legends|Bravo Flight]].<ref name=\"The Starfighter Trap\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Says the guy who killed Echo Two!|Keela Egast|The Starfighter Trap}}\nAlthough Keela was barely able to fit in her [[Flight suit/Legends|flight suit]] and spoke in a soft voice during the briefing, her knowledge about different models of Z-95 Headhunters meant that only experience pilots like Till had the answer to questions regarding fighters.<ref name=\"The Starfighter Trap\" /> Despite her young age and little experience she had a strong edge in her voice when calling out Dren for attacking his own forces. She refused to give in the fight, only being disabled by Dren Melne near the end stages of the battle.<ref name=\"The Starfighter Trap\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GamerCite|1|The Starfighter Trap}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30ad\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30a8\u30ac\u30b9\u30c8\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Egast, Keela}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Royal Naboo Security Force personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
