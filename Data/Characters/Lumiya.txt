It makes their decisions flawed.|Jacen Solo and Lumiya|Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines}}\n'''Lumiya''', born '''Shira Elan Colla Brie''', was a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who went from being an agent of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] to [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lady]] of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. Born on [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]] during the height of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] reign over the majority of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], Brie dedicated herself to the tenets of the Imperial [[New Order/Legends|New Order]] doctrine. This garnered the interest of Palpatine's chief enforcer, the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], who sped the young woman's advancement in various Imperial-sponsored programs, including her enrollment into the [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Intelligence]] [[Academy of Carida|Academy]] of [[Carida/Legends|Carida]]. After she graduated with top honors and was promoted to the rank of [[Major/Legends|major]] by Vader himself, Brie was given a highly classified mission to [[Spy/Legends|infiltrate]] the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and either cause the [[Death/Legends|death]] or ostracism of Rebel hero and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] amongst his peers. Brie achieved the latter, but the [[Battle of the secret armada|events]] that ended in Skywalker's disgrace also left her horribly disfigured and near death. She was recovered by [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader, who rehabilitated her with [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic replacements]] much like [[Darth Vader's armor|his own]]. Brie then began to [[Sith training|train]] in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] at the feet of Vader under the assumed identity of Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith.\n\nWhile Lumiya studied in secret as [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] Vader's [[Shadow Hand]], she also served as one of the [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hands]]&mdash;[[The Force/Legends|Force-trained]] [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] who answered to Palpatine himself. She embarked on a pilgrimage to the [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]], during which she crafted [[Lumiya's lightwhip|her own]] [[Lightwhip/Legends|lightwhip]]. While on that sojourn, however, both Palpatine and Darth Vader perished [[Battle of Endor/Legends|in battle]] at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], and as the foremost of their pupils despite her incomplete training, she defaulted to [[Sith Master/Legends|Mistress of the Sith]]. Purpose-driven toward vengeance against Luke Skywalker and the Alliance for the deaths of her Sith Masters, she [[Duel on Vjun|apprenticed]] an ex-[[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] named [[Flint]] and lent support to the [[extra-galactic]] [[Nagai]] [[Species/Legends|species]]' [[Nagai\u2013Tof War|war]] against their mortal [[Tof]] enemies. The Sith Lady suffered a [[Battle of Herdessa (Nagai\u2013Tof War)|critical defeat]] early in her campaign, the damage from which required replacement of her armor, and saw the debut of a triangular headdress that, along with her lightwhip, henceforth became her trademark. She continued to aid the Nagai, during which time she [[Skirmish on Kinooine|confronted]] and ultimately lost to her sworn enemy, [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] Luke Skywalker. As the Nagai&ndash;Tof War commenced, however, the Dark Lady escaped Skywalker's custody, with promises of mayhem for him when next they met. She subsequently ended her partnership with the Nagai in favor of the Tof opposition, but their swift [[Battle of Saijo|defeat]] by the unified forces of the Alliance, Empire, and Nagai signified the end of the war. Thought by the majority of the galaxy to be dead, Lumiya retreated to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] with retribution ever on her mind.\n\nWhile in hiding, the Dark Lady prepared a [[Lumiya's fleet|fleet]] in preparation for a strike against the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], the successor government to the Rebel Alliance. She once again worked closely with Imperial Intelligence and took the second of her [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentices]], former [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Imperial Royal Guardsman]] [[Carnor Jax]], after the mysterious death of her first. Together Lumiya and Jax eliminated the last vestiges of the [[Prophets of the Dark Side]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]]. She then charged him with the infiltration of the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Ruling Council]] in anticipation of a threat to [[Lumiya's Sith|her Sith Order]], while she herself brokered for additional assets with Imperial [[Regent/Legends|Regent]] [[Ysanne Isard]]. However, Jax's own nascent ambitions led him into an ill-conceived attempt at betrayal against Lumiya, and another former Royal Guardsman, [[Kir Kanos]], killed Jax, leaving the Dark Lady once again without an apprentice. She returned to the planet [[Korriban]] to plot strategy and, in possession of the ancient [[Oracle stone|Sith oracle stone]] [[Sith artifact/Legends|artifact]], continued to monitor galactic events from afar. By [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]], though, Lumiya had abandoned the Outer Rim in favor of the former [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] [[The Home|dwelling]] of the ancient Sith Lord [[Darth Vectivus|Vectivus]], where she mastered the creation of his dark side&ndash;empowered [[Force phantom]]s. That same year, she considered an invitation by a [[One Sith|new order]] of Sith on Korriban, who sought to bring the Dark Lady into their fold, but was delayed en route by advance scouts of the extra-galactic [[Yuuzhan Vong]] race on the eve of their [[Yuuzhan Vong War|galactic invasion]]. She eluded capture and attempted to undermine the Yuuzhan Vong offensive in her own way from the shadows.\n\nAs the galaxy descended further into chaos, Lumiya came to believe that only the supreme will of a Dark Lord of the Sith could impose order and stability. It was while cultivating such beliefs that she met the [[Fosh]] ex-Jedi&ndash;turned&ndash;Sith [[Vergere]], and through the latter's superior knowledge, Lumiya's training was complete. Together they conspired to restore peace to the galaxy through the creation and ascension of the next Sith Lord. Lumiya ignored a second offer of alliance from those on Korriban, as Lumiya and Vergere contrived to bring the [[Skywalker family/Legends|Skywalker family's]] Sith legacy full circle through [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], the grandson of Darth Vader. She and Vergere facilitated Solo's capture by the Yuuzhan Vong, to whom Vergere had [[Familiar|ingratiated herself]], and the Fosh began the training that Lumiya would eventually finish. Vergere [[Battle of Ebaq|died]] [[28 ABY/Legends|three years]] into the Yuuzhan Vong War with her role in the affair complete, but another twelve passed before Lumiya was prepared to uphold her end of the bargain. In [[40 ABY]], she enacted her plan to beguile Solo against the backdrop of a [[Second Galactic Civil War|new war]], one consequent of her clandestine instigation, by aggravating the already tepid relationship between the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]] and the [[Corellian system]]'s [[Five Worlds]] government. An orchestrated series of events led Solo to Lumiya's home, which resulted in his agreement to take up the way of the Sith. For months she trained him, while continuing her secret manipulations of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia's]] separatist movement and enlisting the services of the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Dark Jedi/Legends|darksider]] [[Alema Rar]] in the process. Lumiya then revealed herself to the Jedi and maneuvered their determination to eliminate her into a distraction from Jacen Solo's utter embrace of the dark side as the Sith Lord Darth Caedus. Satisfied that vengeance had been cemented against her enemies, Lumiya surrendered herself to death in [[Duel on Terephon|combat]] against her long-time nemesis, Luke Skywalker.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Born in Empire capitol. Raised in palace of Emperor Palpatine as part of experiment in adolescent indoctrination. Experiment totally successful.|Excerpt of Brie's Imperial dossier from the Krake Data Vault|Star Wars (1977) 63}}\n[[File:Computer_readout.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Computer readout of Brie's past showing her home on Imperial Center]]\nShira Elan Colla Brie was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], then known as Imperial Center, at the height of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. A [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], Brie's childhood was spent in the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]] of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Brie was chosen for adolescent indoctrination via the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order/Legends|Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]], where she quickly became COMPNOR's premier inductee, and her success there saw her fast-tracked into another [[Unidentified Imperial program|similar Imperial program]] by her superiors. Brie's impressive achievements were noticed by the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor's]] foremost servant, [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Vader]], who recommended Brie for training in the Empire's [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] division.<ref name=\"LDSE\" /><ref name=\"tep\" /> The young woman soon excelled in all aspects of her training and became proficient in nearly all exotic martial arts,<ref name=\"CSWEBrie1\">{{CSWECite|II|265|Lumiya}}</ref> from [[Echani (martial art)/Legends|Echani]] to [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]] [[Stava (skill)|Stava]]. Brie's body was also biologically enhanced with accelerated healing and a maximum increase in her pain threshold;<ref name=\"tep\" /> furthermore, her mental faculties were improved by means of mnemonic drug training.<ref name=\"CSWEBrie1\" />\n\nAs part of her training in Imperial Intelligence, Shira Brie was enrolled in the [[Coruscani Pilot Institute|Coruscanti Pilot Institute]] in [[2 BBY/Legends|2.5 BBY]]. As a [[Cadet/Legends|cadet]], the young woman underwent training under [[Commander/Legends|Commandant]] [[Mogurk]]. Brie struck up a friendship with her fellow trainee and bunk-mate Cadet [[Myrette Davani]], and she soon rose to the top of the class. Throughout her three [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of training, Brie also received instruction under Darth Vader during the night and in utmost secrecy. Although the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] Lord's tutelage wearied Brie, she was able to maintain her position as the Institute's best cadet.<ref name=\"carida\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030904carida|text=Carida: Heavy Duty|int=Carida: Heavy Duty|archivedate=20090603070230}}</ref> Her time in Imperial training became one of the few instances in the young Force-sensitive's life that she felt that others truly cared for her well-being. She swore an oath of loyalty to the Emperor, to which she attached great importance.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n===Training on Carida===\n{{Quote|Shira still hasn't discussed the bug walker incident, and I've stopped pressing her. Nothing like it has happened since. She still spends a lot of time in 'private tutoring' that she won't tell me about, though. Frankly, I think she's heading into intelligence. It would explain why more of a stink wasn't made about the accidental deaths of six students, and it would explain her mysterious private training, which always happens at night. Yet in many ways, she's still the same woman I've known for years. Same sense of humor, same brilliant mind, and the same love of practical jokes. But that darkness inside her keeps growing.|Myrette Davani, who trained alongside Brie|Carida: Heavy Duty}}\nCirca [[0 ABY/Legends|0.5 ABY]], Brie's flight school class transferred from Coruscant to [[Carida/Legends|Carida]] for one last year of study at the [[Academy of Carida|Imperial Military Academy]]. There, Brie and her classmates participated in one term of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] boot camp, followed by a further two terms of strategy, survival, and tactics. As the school's finest [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], the role of flying the personnel [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] from Coruscant to the academy fell to Brie. The cadet refused, however, and her superiors instead selected Davani. The class arrived safely at Carida, a high-[[Gravity/Legends|gravity]] world, and settled in to prepare for boot camp. The training began with two days of arduous physical conditioning in the barracks, before the cadets were dispatched on a 200-[[Kilometer/Legends|kilometer]] hike across one of Carida's [[Desert/Legends|deserts]] on the third day. Brie and her classmates were told by the instructors that they could pack however many supplies they wished, but the young woman perceived the exercise's true purpose. She explained to Davani that the instructors were waiting to see if the cadets would foolishly weigh themselves down with extra [[Water/Legends|water]] and other supplies; any cadet who did would [[Death/Legends|perish]] on the hike due to the world's high gravity. Equipped with standard supplies only, Brie and Davani completed the hike together&mdash;two of only twenty trainees to survive out of two hundred.<ref name=\"carida\" />\n\n[[File:Shira_Brie_NEGTC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A young Shira Brie]]\nThe hikes proved to be a staple of the boot camp training, along with war games and long hours of hypothetical [[Realspace/Legends|space]] combat in the flight [[Holosimulator|simulator]]. Together with Davani, Brie also used simulators to put in extra practice, especially for one upcoming war game against [[Bantha Squad|Bantha]] [[TIE/LN starfighter]] [[training squadron]], in which the two cadets would be operating the new \"bug walker\" [[Mountain Terrain Scout Transport]]s, or MT-STs&mdash;the war games at the academy often served as field tests for new technology. Brie's training under Darth Vader, however, continued to take a toll on the young woman's mental state. In [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], six [[Standard month/Legends|months]] into the final year of the military training, the MT-ST war game was carried out. Brie and her fellow cadets were dropped into a mountainous area known as [[Tarkin's Teeth]], some 300 kilometers outside the academy proper. There, they boarded their MT-STs and began the exercise. While the rest of the [[Squad/Legends|squad]] formed a perimeter, Brie and Davani undertook separate reconnaissance missions in their individual [[Walker/Legends|walkers]]. Brie soon encountered the Bantha Squad walkers and opened fire&mdash;her vehicle, however, had been fitted with live weapons rather than the training [[Laser/Legends|lasers]] employed by the other cadets.<ref name=\"carida\" />\n\nIn moments, Brie had destroyed twelve MT-STs and killed six cadets, and was in the midst of laughter when Davani arrived. Due to pressure from above, the live weapons were blamed on \"instructor error\" and the deaths passed off as training casualties. Although Davani pressured her to discuss the incident, Brie refused to do so. She trained at the academy during the day and with Vader at night, earning consistent high marks from her military superiors and developing new powers under the Sith Lord's tutelage, which continued to affect her psyche. A short time before 1.5 ABY, to celebrate their upcoming graduation ceremony, Brie and Davani headed out into the local [[Caridan district]] on their two-day leave passes. The two cadets began a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] crawl, heading through several establishments in short order and [[Alcohol/Legends|drinking]] at each one. At the first bar, Brie used the Force to exert influence over the [[Caridan (species)|Caridan]] [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] so that she and Davani could enjoy certain perks unavailable to regular customers, such as discounted drinks. Four bars later, when a group of Caridans offered to buy the two women a drink, Brie once again made use of her abilities to immobilize one of the Caridans by [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetically]] flattening him to the floor.<ref name=\"carida\" />\n\nSoon after, Shira Brie graduated from the Imperial Academy with top honors, an accolade that had been achieved by no other student as of [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]]. Lord Vader granted Brie the rank of a [[Major/Legends|major]]<ref name=\"SW63\" /> in Imperial Intelligence. Darth Vader and [[Director/Legends|Director]] [[Ysanne Isard]] of Imperial Intelligence arranged for the young Force-sensitive to be dispatched on a solo mission. Brie proved herself able,<ref name=\"tep\" /> and Vader was further encouraged to personally field her as an operative in his attempts to rid himself of the threat of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name=\"SW63\" /><ref name=\"tep\" />\n\n===Imperial double-agent===\n====Joining the Rebellion====\n{{Quote|I found that the nomads had told the Empire that my tribe was in league with the Rebel Alliance.

Although the world was home to the [[Em'liy]] [[Species/Legends|species]], Brie's cover story falsely identified Humans as the native race. The Em'liy were instead cast as oppressors to the Humans who warred with them and destroyed the society to which Brie supposedly belonged, killing her family in the process. According to the cover story, the supposed war between the Humans and the Em'liy lasted for years until the two species cast their differences aside to make peace with one another. All of Shalyvane's natives then gathered together at a shrine called the [[Circle of Kavaan]] to solidify their new conciliation under the guidance of [[Alien/Legends|alien]] ambassadors contracted by the Em'liy; they were instead attacked by the offworlders, who massacred all those present. Brie, purportedly a little girl at the time, was able to escape the slaughter and was left to survive into adulthood by her own faculties. Many years passed before she learned the \"truth\" of Shalyvane's sterilization from an intoxicated ex-fighter pilot; the Em'liy had allied with the Empire and also lied to them, claiming that Brie's people were members of the Rebel Alliance. Enraged by the revelation, as the fabrication went, Brie sought out the Alliance and decided to enlist.<ref name=\"SW60\">[[Star Wars (1977) 60|''Star Wars'' (1977) 60]]</ref> The verisimilitude of her cover story was bolstered when Darth Vader ordered the [[Cleansing of Shalyvane|razing]] of Chinshassa, which had previously displayed resistance to Imperial rule. Shalyvane also became the secret location by which Brie reported her progress through a biological process that was activated when her unique [[Blood/Legends|blood]] chemistry came into contact with a transmitter embedded within the Circle of Kavaan.<ref name=\"SW63\" />\n\n====Lieutenant Brie====\n{{Quote|Wasn't it nice of Shira, asking to help like that?

When Brie volunteered to accompany Skywalker on a mission to [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin's]] [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] in search of his friend [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], her congenial demeanor and obvious affection for him spurred contemptuous feelings from [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who had been denied Skywalker's companionship on a reconnaissance drill around Haven Base. Oblivious to Organa's scorn, Brie left with Skywalker for Bespin<ref name=\"SW56\" /> in an [[X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing starfighter]] as his [[Wingmate/Legends|wingmate]]. Upon their arrival, Brie noted that Cloud City seemed deserted, and an investigation by Skywalker's [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] determined that the installation of a series of bombs within Cloud City's infrastructure had led to the populace's evacuation. However, the bombs had soon thereafter been neutralized by a [[Lobot/Legends|cyborg]] and a Human, which Skywalker surmised had probably been Lando Calrissian. Before their investigation could take them any further they were attacked by [[Hugo Treece]], an Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]] stationed on Bespin by Darth Vader. They remained pinned under fire from Treece and his squad of stormtroopers until Calrissian's arrival served to distract the Imperial's attention away from Brie and Skywalker. The commander reactivated the bombs through the Force, and the resulting explosion was enough to scare the Imperials into swiftly evacuating Cloud City.<ref name=\"SW57\">[[Star Wars (1977) 57|''Star Wars'' (1977) 57]]</ref>\n\nUpon their return to Arbra, Brie stayed planetside for a time while Skywalker ventured to the [[Bazarre]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]] in the [[Cademimu sector/Legends|Cademimu sector]] with Calrissian and another Rebel Alliance hero, the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]],<ref name=\"SW58\">[[Star Wars (1977) 58|''Star Wars'' (1977) 58]]</ref> to negotiate the sale of four disabled TIE Fighters with weapons [[Merchant/Legends|dealer]] [[Orion Ferret]].<ref name=\"SW59\">[[Star Wars (1977) 59|''Star Wars'' (1977) 59]]</ref> Brie instead took part in an experiment of Organa's that involved hiding a portion of the [[Alliance Fleet|Rebel fleet]] within the [[Arbran|primary]] [[Star/Legends|star]] of the [[Arbran system]]. The expressed reservations of Organa's [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] about carrying out such a hazardous plan without the presence of Luke Skywalker led Brie to volunteer to act in his stead&mdash;a request that was reluctantly granted by the princess.<ref name=\"SW58\" />\n\n====Alliance heroine====\n{{Quote|In recognition of your recent acts of heroism on the planet Shalyvane, you are herewith awarded the Burdine Cluster, along with the traditional advancement in rank&mdash;''Captain'' Brie.|Princess Leia Organa|Star Wars (1977) 61}}\nThe deal with Orion Ferret was successful,<ref name=\"SW59\" /> and Brie was selected alongside as part of [[Flying Bantha Squadron|Skywalker and two others]] to test the reconditioned [[TIE Series|TIE]] Fighters in actual [[Starfighter combat/Legends|combat]] during an [[Skirmish on Spindrift|assault]] on the Imperial [[Spindrift Station]] on the planet of the [[Spindrift|same name]].

Brie was initially denied the specific spatial coordinates of Arbra, Organa's reason being that such knowledge was privy only to the principle and most trusted members of the Rebel Alliance leadership. However, when Commander Skywalker, who knew the map specs of Arbra, offered to accompany Brie on her pilgrimage, Organa grudgingly granted them permission. They arrived in Brie's false hometown of Chinshassa, and the lieutenant led Skywalker and fellow Rogue pilots [[Wald (pilot)|Wald]] and [[Hanc Thorben]] to the Circle of Kavaan, a place of great importance to the Shalyvane natives, but also the means by which Brie was to secretly communicate with Vader. Feigning a need to perform a private ritual, Brie approached the monument and discreetly activated the embedded communications transmitter. Her message to Vader was interrupted, however, when Shalyvane's Em'liy natives [[Skirmish at Chinshassa|ambushed]] the Rebels and forced them into cover. During the ensuing combat, Brie revealed several elements of her false past; that it had been the acts committed against her family and childhood home of Chinshassa by the same natives in allegiance to the Empire that led to her membership with the Rebel Alliance, and that she returned annually to Chinshassa in remembrance of her people's massacre.<ref name=\"SW60\" />\n\nThe Rebels were forced to give ground until Skywalker's astromech, R2-D2, discovered a series of underground tunnels previously mentioned by Brie that could potentially serve as an adequate means of escape. Skywalker volunteered to enter the subterranean labyrinth first but lost the opportunity to do so when Brie, who was already familiar with their existence, jumped in before him. The tunnel was then sealed by an explosion caused by the Em'liy, and the rebels, believing that Brie was lost to them, prepared to make a final stand. As the natives closed in, however, they were routed by Brie, who had successfully found and returned with her X-wing to save her comrades. She decimated the Em'liy attackers in a strafing run and afterward met up with her teammates who&mdash;especially Skywalker&mdash;expressed much relief in knowing that Brie was alive and well.<ref name=\"SW60\" /> A ceremony was held following their return to Haven Base in the presence of many Rebel Alliance members wherein Brie was recognized for her gallantry during the peril she and her fellow Rogues faced on Shalyvane. The prestigious [[Burdine Cluster]] award was presented to the lieutenant along with a promotion to the rank of [[Captain/Legends|captain]] by Organa, who displayed considerable gratitude for the pilot's selfless valor.<ref name=\"SW61\">[[Star Wars (1977) 61|''Star Wars'' (1977) 61]]</ref>\n\n====Mission accomplished====\n{{Quote|&mdash;I had to use ''the Force'' to tell me if the blockading TIE was friend or foe!

They also learned that following the Battle of Hoth, the Empire had captured a [[teezl]], a non-[[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] creature with a natural ability to act as a [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] communications amplifier. Believed to be extinct, the teezl was under escort of the Imperial armada to Coruscant where it was to be installed and made to serve the Empire as a limitless source of communications energy. The Rebel Alliance was aware of that fact and was determined to thwart the Imperials at all costs. An [[Operation Earplug|infiltration mission]] was developed wherein Brie, as a member of Flying Bantha Squadron alongside Skywalker and pilots [[Alph (Rogue)|Alph]] and Hanc Thorben, would disguise herself and sabotage the Imperial armada by means of the TIE fighters<ref name=\"SW61\" /> that had been previously obtained on Bazarre station.<ref name=\"SW59\" /> Just prior to their departure, Brie related to Skywalker her apprehension about the task set before her, and also made obvious her deep affection for him with a passionate kiss&mdash;much to Skywalker's surprise.<ref name=\"SW61\" />\n\nThe preliminary phase of the Rebel mission involved the Flying Banthas' interception of a pair of TIE fighters on patrol of the route by which the Imperial armada was to travel. After the two TIEs were shot down and the armada's recognition codes confiscated, the Rebels donned their own recently acquired<ref name=\"SW59\" /> TIEs and prepared to infiltrate the amassed enemy ships. The successful transmission of the recognition codes allowed for a seamless and unsuspected insertion of Brie's team into the ranks of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial fleet]], and once each of the Flying Banthas had assumed an adequate vantage point, the attacks commenced. The Imperials were confused by what seemed to be friendly fighters engaging in wanton destruction and quickly deduced that Rebel forces had penetrated their ranks with fraudulent fighters. In response, [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Mils Giel]] ordered for the teezl to cause interference on all communication frequencies except the Imperial war band with a psychic shriek in an attempt to expose the enemy forces. With no other means of communication between herself and her team, Brie seized an opportunity to complete the assignment she was originally given by Vader. Capitalizing on the forced comm silence, Brie maneuvered her TIE fighter directly into Skywalker's line of fire; with only the Force to guide him in the determination of friend from foe, Skywalker landed a direct hit that seemingly destroyed Brie's fighter. His assault also resulted in the death of the teezl and the effective end of the [[Battle of the secret armada|battle]]. Skywalker's return to Haven Base was met with somber greetings; he was immediately debriefed by Organa and a [[Holocamera|holocam]] recording from Thorben's TIE revealed that the fighter which Skywalker had shot down was not one of an enemy, but that of Captain Shira Brie. Though she had been unable to kill him, Brie's Imperial mission was a total success; Skywalker had been absolutely disgraced in the eyes of his fellow Rebels for her apparent death, and he was riddled with guilt over an error in judgment that resulted in the evident demise of both an Alliance champion and the woman for whom he had developed strong feelings.<ref name=\"SW61\" /> He was initially stripped of his Alliance commission,<ref name=\"SW62\">[[Star Wars (1977) 62|''Star Wars'' (1977) 62]]</ref> but he was later exonerated after he infiltrated the Empire-operated [[Krake Data Vault]] on [[Krake's Planet]] and discovered records that detailed the nature of Brie's true Imperial allegiance.<ref name=\"SW63\" />\n\n===Rebirth===\n====\"Hands\"====\n{{Quote|Come Lumiya.

Brie would have died alone in the starfighter,<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> but the modifications made to her body during her Imperial training as well as her facility with [[Force healing/Legends|healing]] and [[hibernation trance]]s helped her survive the hard vacuum of space. She was discovered by Darth Vader and returned to his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']], for rehabilitation, where it was determined that extensive science and [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetics]] were required to save her life.<ref name=\"tep\" /> The mechanical implants further enhanced Brie's body,<ref name=\"lumiyadatabank\" /> although ultimately she was left more machine than woman.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> After she had been restored, Brie began to learn the ways of the Sith as Vader's [[Shadow Hand]].

In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Vader brought his secret apprentice Lumiya before Palpatine. Upon their arrival at the Imperial Palace, they interrupted a meeting between Palpatine and another of his personal [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]], [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]]. The women crossed paths with immediate and intense animosity toward one another. Jade departed, and Lumiya was ushered into Palpatine's presence, presented by Darth Vader for consideration as an [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hand]]&mdash;secret agents of the Emperor whose sole purpose was to bring his will to fruition.<ref name=\"JVS\" /> Palpatine accepted Lumiya into his service and allowed her to continue [[Sith training|training]] under Darth Vader.<ref name=\"lumiyadatabank\" />\n\nLumiya soon thereafter was sequestered by Darth Vader on [[Ziost/Legends|Ziost]], the ancient homeworld of the [[Sith (species)/Legends|Sith species]].<ref name=\"lumiyadatabank\" /> There she discovered an archaic [[Sith scroll/Legends|Sith tome]] that detailed the process required to craft a [[Lightwhip/Legends|lightwhip]]; a rare weapon similar to but more difficult to master than the traditional [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], the lightwhip possessed a flexible energy beam in lieu of a steady blade.<ref name=\"LDSE\" /> With such ancient knowledge, she created a [[Lumiya's lightwhip|unique device]] with a [[hilt]] of nearly indestructible [[Mandalorian iron]] from which many extensions spewed forth. Shards of [[Kaiburr crystal]] given to her by Darth Vader provided the power source for the strands of energy, while tendrils of metal and others of studded [[Leather/Legends|leather]] complemented the pliant beams of plasma to make a one-of-a-kind and deadly flail.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Her final test as the Dark Lord's pupil was finally complete, but Lumiya was on Ziost when the Empire suffered a pivotal [[Battle of Endor/Legends|defeat]] over [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] at the hands of the Rebel Alliance.

Queen of the stanging ''Sith''?|Mara Jade Skywalker|Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice}}\nWith no one left to further her Sith knowledge, Lumiya proclaimed herself Dark Lady of the Sith and embarked on her own quest to progress in dark side wisdom, going first to the planet [[Nyssa]] in search of the [[Mecrosa Order]], an organization with a historic allegiance to the ways of the Sith. Known to be in possession of many ancient secrets and [[Sith artifact/Legends|artifacts]], the Order's members felt a sense of obligation to Lumiya, whom they felt bore an unnerving resemblance to the late Darth Vader. She was given access to all of the Mecrosa's relics, and she was even allowed to take from them possession of the oldest of [[Sith holocron/Legends|Sith holocrons]]&mdash;[[Adas's holocron|that]] of the legendary ''[[Sith'ari]]'' [[Adas]].<ref name=\"end\" />\n\nShortly after the Battle of Endor, Lumiya amassed a naval [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] of Imperial [[Starship/Legends|starships]] in her efforts to consolidate power in preparation for retaliation against the Rebel Alliance. [[Lumiya's fleet|Her armada]] included three [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers]], two [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate/Legends|EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates]], and four [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 Corellian Corvettes]]. More than two hundred TIE/LN starfighters and [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE/sa bombers]] completed the fleet and were divided into several squads amongst the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]], [[Frigate/Legends|frigates]], and [[Firestorm (CR90 corvette)|one]] of the [[Corvette/Legends|corvettes]].<ref name=\"LDSE\" /> The details of the fragmentation of the Empire were still unclear to many Imperial servicemen, and Lumiya sought to keep the truth hidden by depriving her subordinates of certain information, thus ensuring their complete loyalty to her and the endeavors she undertook. While in [[Sith Worlds|Sith space]], Lumiya's fleet came into contact with a vanguard representing an [[extra-galactic]], spacefaring species, the [[Nagai]]. The commander of the force hailed her flagship, the escort frigate [[Revenant (EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate)|''Revenant'']], under the impression that an [[Officer/Legends|officer]] of the Imperial Navy would respond; instead, Lumiya answered. The Dark Lady learned that she shared a common enemy with the Nagai in the Rebel Alliance, and she promised the support of her resources to the invaders upon proposition of a united front.<ref name=\"TFW\" />\n\n====Events on Herdessa====\n{{Quote|Run back to your friends, little Leia&hellip; but you have worse things to worry about than stormtroopers.

She went to the [[Mid Rim]] world of [[Herdessa/Legends|Herdessa]],<ref name=\"lumiyadatabank\" /> where she installed herself as the head of planetary security on behalf of the planet's oppressive leadership, the [[Herdessan Guild]]. Lumiya organized a Guild-sanctioned [[Slavery/Legends|slaving]] ring which targeted the planet's lower-class citizens for transport off-world. However, the arrival on Herdessa of Alliance delegates [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] and Leia Organa, who promised to guarantee civil rights for the planet's citizens under the new [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government, threatened Lumiya's covert operation. Wearing the face of benevolence, the Dark Lady and a squad of [[Herdessan shocktrooper]]s apprehended several hecklers after Organa was pummeled with mud. Lumiya located the culprit, a woman named [[Suzu]], in [[guild sector three]] and aggressively arrested her, but was interrupted by Organa&mdash;whose intervention on Suzu's behalf resulted in the woman's escape. Enraged, Lumiya attacked the princess but was betrayed by her own cumbersome cybernetic enhancements, which saw her quickly bested and slammed to the ground by Organa. As the princess fled after Suzu, the humiliated Lumiya vowed to deal with both women.<ref name=\"SW88\">[[Star Wars (1977) 88|''Star Wars'' (1977) 88]]</ref>\n\nLumiya and her shocktroopers tracked Organa to Suzu's hideout and forcefully demanded their surrender. Organa was able to escape the firefight that ensued, and Lumiya chased her for a time before abandoning pursuit, instead choosing to round up all the Herdessan rebels in the city center for a public declaration that unless Organa was turned over to the custody of the Herdessan Guild, executions would commence. Imperial stormtroopers assisted the Herdessan shocktroopers in Lumiya's tyranny and even apprehended Organa's companion, Mon Mothma, who was counted among the nonconformists. An altercation erupted between [[Finn (Herdessan)|one of the prisoners]] and a stormtrooper, and Lumiya decided that the prisoner would be the first to die. Suzu then conceded to Lumiya's demands and betrayed Organa's whereabouts to the authorities, but it was all a ruse; Organa instead appeared behind Lumiya and incapacitated her with several blaster shots before she eliminated the shocktroopers, freed the captives, and led them in a successful [[Battle of Herdessa (Nagai\u2013Tof War)|revolt]] against the Herdessan Guild. With her sinister benefactors overthrown and her slave trade dissolved, Lumiya quietly retreated, but not without promises to take revenge on the Alliance&mdash;namely Princess Leia Organa&mdash;for thwarting her efforts on Herdessa.<ref name=\"SW88\" />\n\n====Upholding tradition====\n{{Quote|In terms of the classic Master&ndash;and&ndash;apprentice Sith structure, there can be only two&hellip;|Lumiya|Legacy of the Force: Betrayal}}\n[[File:LumiyaJackedUp.jpg|thumb|left|360px|Lumiya plots her revenge after the Battle of Herdessa.]]\nLumiya's cybernetic enhancements had been severely damaged on Herdessa<ref name=\"SW88\" /> and required extensive repairs.<ref name=\"LDSE\" /> Upon completion, she emerged sporting new armor, and donned for the first time a triangular cloth headdress<ref name=\"SW95\">[[Star Wars (1977) 95|''Star Wars'' (1977) 95]]</ref> that, along with her lightwhip, became thenceforth synonymous with her name.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> Lumiya fully intended to resume her campaign against the Alliance of Free Planets; however, a matter of greater importance that presented a considerable problem manifested itself: the continuation of the Sith. Lumiya reorganized the Order [[Lumiya's Sith|in her own image]],<ref name=\"end\" /> but she maintained the core ideals of enduring elusiveness that were fundamental to the previous Order's survival. The ancient \"Rule of Two\" doctrine to which Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader adhered<ref name=\"JVS\" /> stated that the power of the dark side could only be divided between two individuals in the entire galaxy at any given time: one Sith Master to personify its power, and a single Sith apprentice to covet it.<ref name=\"ROT\">''[[Darth Bane: Rule of Two]]''</ref> Lumiya thus began to search for being who was in her eyes worthy of the Sith teachings.<ref name=\"end\" />\n\nThough exceptionally strong in the Force in her own right,<ref name=\"LDSE\" /> Lumiya had not been Darth Vader's only pupil. The Dark Lord had several students and intended to eventually pit them against one another for the right to become his true Sith apprentice.<ref name=\"end\" /> After Vader's death Lumiya sought out one of those pupils, a young Force-sensitive stormtrooper named [[Flint]]. While he was still alive, Vader had planned for Lumiya and Flint to contend with one another, but the Dark Lord's premature death at Endor left them both without their master. Lumiya located Flint in Vader's abandoned [[Bast Castle|citadel]] on the planet [[Vjun/Legends|Vjun]], where she [[Duel on Vjun|confronted]] him for the position of Sith Master. The Dark Lady's superior strength resulted in the sound defeat of Flint, and she took the [[Belderone/Legends|Belderone]] native as her first apprentice.<ref name=\"end\" />\n\nPlans were immediately set in motion by the new Sith to undermine all that the Alliance of Free Planets had achieved in the wake of Emperor Palpatine's death.

An Alliance scouting party had recently been [[Skirmish on Kinooine|dispatched]] to Kinooine after life-forms had been detected on the otherwise unoccupied world. Lumiya ambushed them and killed all of the team's twenty members save a man named [[Faron Tolis]], whom she spared for interrogation. She accused Tolis of being a member of the former Rebel Alliance, and attempted to torture him into disclosing the whereabouts of Princess Leia Organa, something of which he held no knowledge. Under penalty of death, Faron surprised Lumiya when he revealed that Organa had nothing to do with his team's mission; it had instead been Lumiya's sworn nemesis, Luke Skywalker, who had dispatched them to survey the Outer Rim planetoid.<ref name=\"SW95\" />\n\nLumiya's abduction of Tolis and company caused Skywalker himself, along with a female [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] named [[Dani]] and her [[Chuhkyvi]] lover [[Kiro]], to journey to Kinooine in search of his missing reconnaissance team. While Dani and Kiro explored the area surrounding their camp, the Dark Lady caught them unawares and brutally attacked them with her lightwhip. Knowing that Skywalker would come for his comrades, Lumiya took Dani captive and, after smashing the faceplate of Kiro's [[Rebreather/Legends|rebreather]] helmet, left him for dead. Skywalker found Kiro and did not have to search far for the Chuhkyvi's assailant; Lumiya had been waiting for him on a nearby precipice.

In her absence, Kiro infiltrated her underground lair and rescued Skywalker. Lumiya, who had taken up position above ground on a cliff edge, was completely surprised when the pair appeared on the crag behind her and was unable to prevent Skywalker from telekinetically reclaiming his lightsaber from her possession. Not to be deterred, Lumiya prepared to face him in combat yet again, but she failed to properly assess the significant change in circumstances; in addition to his usual weapon, Skywalker had armed himself with a lightsaber with a shorter blade, known as a [[Lightsaber shoto|shoto]]. Lumiya's weapon was no match for the conjunct assault of Skywalker's two sabers, which were able to counter the duality of her lightwhip's tendrils. She charged her opponent in a fit of rage after being disarmed, only to be stripped of enough armor that her face was exposed and her true identity as Shira Brie was revealed.<ref name=\"SW96\" />\n\nThe humiliated Sith Lady begged for death and blamed Skywalker for the tragedies that had befallen her thus far in life; even in defeat, she vowed that her vengeance would only be sated when Skywalker himself was dead.

Lumiya then went from the ''Revenant'' to the asteroid in her personal [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|Lambda-class T-4a shuttle]] and entered the base, prepared to make an example of those inside. Her stormtroopers rounded up all the scientists for interrogation, and [[Unidentified base staffmember|one indignant individual]] was immediately executed by the Dark Lady&mdash;his [[throat]] Force-crushed in response to a snide remark. Lumiya then made certain that the base staff recommitted themselves to Imperial service, and ordered a garrison to occupy the station to further ensure their cooperation. Before she departed the Cron Drift with the remainder of her fleet, Lumiya vowed to return in eight weeks to make certain her will remained uncontested.<ref name=\"LDSE\" />\n\n=====Return of the Emperor=====\n{{Quote|I'm not sure I even count the Emperor's clones as Sith.

She meanwhile journeyed to the planet [[Caprioril]],<ref name=\"end\" /> where she learned that Jade, under the assumed identity of \"Marellis,\" had gone underground as a [[Come-up flector|starport hustler]] for a [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] gang.<ref name=\"SWAJ1\">[[Star Wars Adventure Journal 1|''Star Wars Adventure Journal'' 1]]</ref> Lumiya located Jade and attempted to persuade her to come back into the Imperial fold, a petition that Jade refused. [[Duel on Caprioril|A duel]] resulted, in which Jade escaped. The Dark Lady chose not to report her failure to Isard, which led the Empire to conclude that her confrontation with Jade had somehow resulted in Lumiya's demise&mdash;a position that thus brought the Empire into agreement with the New Republic, which had maintained that Lumiya had perished at the end of the Nagai&ndash;Tof conflict.<ref name=\"end\" />\n\nThrough Jax's own machinations, the Dark Lady's apprentice began to secretly manipulate the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Empire's ruling council]].

The threat to the Sith of which Lumiya spoke also manifested itself at that time, in the form of the return of Emperor Palpatine. However, his resumed reign was brief; the [[Cloning/Legends|clone bodies]] he had used to facilitate his [[Transfer essence|resurrection]] had been sabotaged by Imperial physicians,<ref name=\"end\" /> which was the catalyst for his final death on the planet Onderon [[11 ABY/Legends|less than a year later]].<ref name=\"EE2\">[[Empire's End 2|''Empire's End'' 2]]</ref> Carnor Jax immediately attempted to install himself as the new Emperor, but his dynasty was short-lived.

That same year, Lumiya learned that although she was without an apprentice to continue the legacy of the dark side, she was not alone in its practice; a former Jedi of the Old Republic named [[Darth Krayt|A'Sharad Hett]] had been a student of Sith teaching prior to his capture by Yuuzhan Vong scouts in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. While in captivity, he was approached by a Yuuzhan Vong agent named [[Vergere]] who, like Hett, was also an Old Republic Jedi&ndash;turned&ndash;Sith. The [[Fosh]] ex-Jedi imparted her own knowledge to Hett, who believed that in order to restore stability in the galaxy, the Sith needed to abandon the Rule of Two and instead adopt a [[Rule of One]]&mdash;a new axiom of many Sith who operated as a single unit.<ref name=\"LEG18\">[[Legacy (2006) 18|''Legacy'' (2006) 18]]</ref>\n\nVergere, a staunch adherent to Darth Bane's ancient principle, rejected Hett's idea and left him to the mercy of the Yuuzhan Vong. Hett eventually escaped captivity and returned to Korriban, where he assumed the mantle of Dark Lord, with the new name Darth Krayt, and founded his [[One Sith]].<ref name=\"LEG18\" /> The attention of the One Sith had fallen upon Lumiya, and she was invited by Krayt to consort with them on their namesake's ancestral homeworld. An escort for the Dark Lady was sent in the form of the Sith Master [[Lomi Plo]] and her apprentice [[Welk]], but on the return journey, they were forestalled by the Yuuzhan Vong.

Through her time with Vergere, Lumiya had come to believe, however, that the One Sith's methods were too slow; by the time Krayt's Order had moved beyond infancy, Skywalker's Jedi would be too powerful. Unwilling to deviate from the Rule of Two, Lumiya rejected Krayt's idea and accepted Vergere's realization in the folly of Krayt's long-term affair.<ref name=\"inferno\" />\n\nGiven a new purpose through the teachings of Vergere, Lumiya retired her own desires in service of a Sith destiny.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> However, both women knew that neither could restore peace to the galaxy themselves; Lumiya's cybernetic implants limited her Force potential, while Vergere had become tainted by her collaboration with the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Together they conspired to select a new Sith champion, one who would reign as a benign dictator and impose peace and stability over a tumultuous galaxy so often plagued by war. The question of who would be chosen was one of great importance; many candidates were considered, and many discarded. [[Kyp Durron]], a powerful Jedi Master, was considered too volatile and obstinate, while Lumiya's old rival [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] was felt to possess too many attachments. [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]], the daughter of Leia and Han Solo, was dismissed as too emotional, while Leia Solo herself was bypassed as too fearful of her [[Parent/Legends|father]] Darth Vader's legacy.

Aware that she would have to find a way to lure Solo to a location of her choosing, Lumiya alighted upon the idea of a riddle or a puzzle that the Jedi would have to unravel. She drew on a variety of different cultures, Sith ideals, perversions of Jedi precepts, and Solo's own past, to construct a small piece of beadcraft, an artifact made up of a series of [[Lorrd Artifact|intricately designed colored tassels]]. Each section was unique and carried its own message. Lumiya ordered the creation of lines from the [[Tahu'ip]] culture of the Twi'lek people, the Bith [[Aalagar]] race of [[Clak'dor VII]], the language of the [[Firrerreo]], the [[Prison dialect of Kessel|prison dialect]] of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]], and numerous other sources, intent on the creation of an item that would attract Solo's attention and encourage him to explore its meaning.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nSeveral lines, such as the Tahu'ip tassel, referred to Solo's own life and how he had learned to strengthen himself through pain while in Yuuzhan Vong captivity. Others referred to the trials he would endure as he ascended to Sith mastery&mdash;the sacrifice of love, which Lumiya presumed would be carried out by means of the murder of a relative or friend&mdash;the ruination of those who denied justice, and the balance of peace and conflict.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> While several of the tassels' elements were contrived, others, such as the sacrifice Solo would have to make, were the province of the Force itself.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> The final line, which pertained to Solo being drawn from peace into conflict, was constructed from an ancient [[Sith (language)|Sith dialect]] used specifically on the world of Ziost and imbued with the Force, in a last attempt to capture Solo's attention.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" /> Although Lumiya was operating in the realms of Sith prophecy, she was far from omniscient in what needed to be done.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n====Puppetmaster====\n=====Initiating a war=====\n{{Quote|To Thrackan Sal-Solo, Chief of State, Corellia, all greetings and respects.

However, the Dark Lady felt that Solo's rise to power would best occur against the backdrop of war and instability. The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and its Chief of State, the Alderaanian [[Cal Omas]], maintained close ties with the Jedi Order and operated alongside them to maintain peace and stability. Nevertheless, tensions had risen between the Galactic Alliance and [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], a planet with a [[Corellian/Legends|people]] known for their independence and pride. The Corellian government, headed by [[Five World Prime Minister]] [[Aidel Saxan]], wished to enjoy the benefits of Galactic Alliance membership while flouting the government's regulations. In order to enable the rise of Jacen Solo, Lumiya decided to plunge the galaxy into conflict by agitating the subsequent secession movement for which the [[Five Worlds]] confederacy began to muster support.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n[[File:CatO9Tails.jpg|thumb|left|375px|Lumiya engineered the Second Galactic Civil War for her own ends.]]\nEmploying Darth Vectivus' Force phantom technique, she projected the image of [[Edela Klauskin]], the late wife of [[Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet]] Admiral [[Matric Klauskin]], and began to subtly coerce him to engage in a series of actions designed to further upset the already strained relations between the Galactic Alliance and the Corellians. The first of them was interwoven within the highly-classified [[Operation Roundabout]], with Klauskin's role as that of commander over the [[Galactic Alliance Second Fleet|Alliance Second Fleet's]] ill-fated attempt to place Corellia itself under siege. When that action failed, Lumiya influenced Klauskin to [[Battle of Tralus (Second Galactic Civil War)|attack and occupy]] the nearby world of [[Tralus/Legends|Tralus]], in further aggravation of an already volatile situation. Both parties wished to bring an end to what was quickly degenerating into yet another war, and both governments sent delegates to meet on the [[Toryaz Station|Toryaz]] space station near [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]] in an attempt to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Lumiya decided to partake in the negotiations as well, though not as an advocate of either party, but rather as a spy and saboteur. She began with an anonymous message to Corellian Head of State and [[Minister of War (Five Worlds)|Minister of War]] [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]] that alerted him to the secret meeting and enticed him with an opportunity to eliminate several of their mutual rivals in one fell swoop. Sal-Solo obliged and provided Lumiya with twenty commandos, most of Corellian origin, all Human, and all expendable; each was terminally ill, afflicted with various diseases that could not be cured by any known means. To hinder any interrogation attempts should any of the commandos be captured, each was injected with a powerful alkaloid [[Poison/Legends|poison]], one that would guarantee death shortly after it was administered.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nWhile disguised as a Kuati mercantile princess, the Dark Lady infiltrated Toryaz station's [[Narsacc Habitat]] and accosted station captain [[Siron Tawaler]], whom she [[Mind trick/Legends|mentally seduced]] through the Force into her service. She convinced the security captain that he was under consideration to be chosen as her [[Telbun|consort]], and presented him with documents that, among other things, verified her pseudo-identity. She claimed that one of the Jedi on the station was determined to kill her, and that Tawaler had to do everything in his power to prevent such an act from taking place. Under the pretense of being selected for such a prestigious Kuati honor and determined to thwart any assassination attempts on part of the \"rogue Jedi,\" Captain Tawaler was compelled to help Lumiya. He provided her with detailed schematics of the habitat, including the lodgings of each of the delegates. They then proceeded to Narsacc Habitat's [[Hangar/Legends|docking bay]] to rendezvous with Sal-Solo's recently arrived commandos. After briefing her assassins on their [[Attack on Toryaz Station|mission]], Lumiya used a Force suggestion that caused Captain Tawaler to enter an [[Airlock/Legends|airlock]] under the impression that he was supposed to board the commandos' [[Sentinel-class landing craft/Legends|''Sentinel''-class shuttle]] and return to Kuat. That, however, was a deception on Lumiya's part; the shuttle had already disengaged from the hangar. Tawaler nonetheless initiated the depressurization sequence and died soon afterward, the victim of explosive decompression.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n=====Meeting Jacen Solo=====\n{{Quote|Hello. Jedi Solo, Jedi Dinn, young Skywalker.''\"<br />\"''You know us.''\"<br />\"''Of course.

As planned, each one died before interrogation ensued by the Jedi or anyone else. Aware that Jacen Solo was among those on Toryaz Station, Lumiya left the tassels&mdash;the lure through which she intended to ensnare the young Jedi&mdash;by the airlock where Captain Tawaler committed suicide, under the pretense that scrutiny into the botched attack would lead investigators there. The Dark Lady believed that Solo's curiosity into the tassels' meaning would lead him to [[Lorrd/Legends|Lorrd]], a planet in the [[Kanz sector]] with a culture and history of non-verbal communication, where he would find an expert on the subject named [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Heilan Rotham]]. She then left Narsacc Habitat and pursued the commandos' shuttle to the [[Coronet City Spaceport]] in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]], Corellia, where she killed the pilot, preempted the vessel for herself, and re-registered it under the alias of a Human [[Commenor/Legends|Commenori]] woman named \"Brisha Syo.\" She took the shuttle to Lorrd, paid for a week's worth of parking at the [[Lorrd City Spaceport|Lorrd spaceport]], and waited for Jacen Solo, who soon arrived with his cousin [[Ben Skywalker]] and the [[Jedi Watchman/Legends|watchman]] of the system, a female named [[Nelani Dinn]]. While they met with Rotham, Lumiya secretly incited several seemingly random acts of [[terror]]ism around [[Lorrd City]], the first of which involved [[Ordith Huarr|a man]] who threatened to fire [[Concussion missile/Legends|concussion missiles]] into the most heavily populated area of the city unless he was given audience with a Jedi. Although that crisis abated due to the intervention of Solo and his companions, subsequent Force-influenced catastrophes plagued Lorrd City in the days that followed, all at the instigation of Lumiya. Meanwhile, Ben Skywalker had ventured out into Lorrd City on his own, where he discovered the shuttle that had escaped from Toryaz Station docked in the city spaceport. He placed a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing beacon]] on the vessel and advised Security lieutenant [[Neav Samran]] to contact him if and when the pilot returned. Satisfied that her actions had guaranteed the continued presence of the Jedi on Lorrd, Lumiya went back to the vessel and was immediately detained by Samran. She was taken to the security station, until which time the Jedi arrived to interrogate her.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nShe did not have to wait long for the Jedi, who arrived soon afterward with a number of questions. She greeted them all by name, something which startled them, and admitted to having interfered in their affairs for some time before actually meeting them face-to-face. She denied any explicit complicity in actions of the recent string of unusual events, instead claiming that she heard their plans to commit heinous acts in her dreams and that, through her dreams, she suggested to them that they somehow involve the Jedi. Unable to discern truth from lies, Solo inquired as to her connection with the events on Toryaz Station, but Syo only admitted to her presence on-station as that of an observer of Jacen Solo specifically, with her [[Force power/Legends|Force abilities]] employed to remain hidden while doing so. She claimed to have witnessed the death of Security Captain Tawaler at the hands of a hooded individual by uncontrolled decompression and decided at that point to flee, though not before leaving her tassel artifact behind in the same airlock through which Tawaler had spaced, totally intent of its eventual possession by Solo. Thus she came by Lorrd, with full anticipation of Solo's imminent arrival. In an attempt to piece the entire puzzle together, Solo demanded to know the truth, a request she agreed to only if the Jedi joined her at her home near Bimmiel. Solo initially declined, and Syo refused to divulge anything further. She was threatened with several different punishments by an exasperated Solo, even death, but nothing he said was able to sway her. She waited patiently as Solo then consulted his comrades and finally agreed to join Syo at her home.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n=====Seducing a Jedi=====\n{{Quote|The galaxy is dissolving into chaos.

They were led inside as she explained the history of the mining habitat, one the Jedi recognized as a centuries-old mining station that had been abandoned at great expense. Syo commented on the habitat's former administrator, who had also been a Sith Lord, but dismissed any further conversation as they ascended four floors in a turbolift to a chamber lined with artwork and educational materials. She denied their suspicions of her status as some form of Sith adept and revealed the asteroid's permeation with both sides of the Force, something with which Solo was preoccupied. Syo then admitted to being a student of all aspects of the Force, one who focused primarily on utilization of Sith teachings for the benefit of others. She explained her beliefs about the differences between the light and dark sides of the Force, as well as the history of the Home and the semi-sentient mynock-like species that had once resided there. She also presented her example of a benevolent [[darksider]] in the form of Darth Vectivus, an ancient Sith Master who had learned to wield the dark side without malice. She explained that while many Sith Lords of yesteryear&mdash;Solo's grandfather, Darth Vader included&mdash;were already corrupt individuals prior to becoming Sith, Vectivus had been a man of solid moral stature long before his affirmation of the dark side, and he was thus able to ignore temptations of malevolence and soft-heartedness. She next revealed her own relationship with Vader, which exasperated Solo, who realized that he still knew nothing about either Syo or her motives. Although she confessed to subterfuge, she claimed that her true reason for the presence of Jedi was to confront a Sith Lord that supposedly resided in the asteroid's lowest levels.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n[[File:Jacen-betrayal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jacen Solo, whom Lumiya convinced to become her apprentice]]\nAs the turbolift bore them to the habitat's lowest level, Syo joked about the Sith Lord's identity; the Order to which he belonged Solo believed had been eradicated with the death of Emperor Palpatine's final clone. While the last fully vested Sith Masters had died with Vader and the Emperor, Syo claimed that capable aspirants had indeed survived and upheld centuries of Sith tradition. The turbolift then opened onto a rail system that led into the mine proper, and Syo cautioned that Ben Skywalker should remain behind. Solo refused to leave his cousin, so Syo and the three Jedi boarded the railcar and descended into the depths of the mine. Shortly into their ride, Syo used the Force to hurl Skywalker and Dinn from the railcar, and sent hundreds of mynock Force-phantoms to harry them. Solo felt her Force exertion, but Syo assured him that separation had been for their own good, given the overwhelming nature of the danger that lay ahead. With Solo effectively isolated from his companions, they began to discuss the Sith Lord whom Syo claimed resided in the mine. A phantasmal man of her creation then appeared before them who, although obscured by the hood of his cloak, identified himself as that being. After a brief exchange, the apparition disappeared and was replaced by one of Luke Skywalker. While his illusory uncle entered into [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]] with Solo, Syo created a phantom of Mara Jade Skywalker that simultaneously attacked Ben Skywalker, and another of Darth Vectivus to waylay Nelani Dinn, both elsewhere in the mines. Exhaustion forced her to end the assault shortly afterward, but the test she had just conducted of Solo had been successful; his refusal to tap into the abundant dark side energy of the asteroid had saved his life. Syo next led him to a door made of ebony stone&mdash;immovable, save by an exertion through the dark side. The door opened upon the slightest command of dark power by Solo, who followed behind Syo as she brought him before her estate. She then confessed that she was in fact Sith, one who had been trained by Solo's grandfather, Darth Vader; how she had been born Shira Brie, and the fateful confrontation with Luke Skywalker that resulted in her rebirth as Lumiya.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\nLumiya revealed her desire for Solo to become the next Dark Lord of the Sith, the training for which she explained had begun years ago during Solo's time with Vergere. They were interrupted by the arrival of a lone Nelani Dinn, who attempted to end the Dark Lady's seductions with the activation of her lightsaber. When the seemingly unarmed Lumiya refused to acknowledge Dinn's authority, she was attacked. Lumiya evaded Dinn to draw her lightwhip, and landed a disorienting strike to the Jedi's face. Dinn advanced, but was painfully forced into retreat by Lumiya. The Jedi telekinetically hurled two marble busts, the first of which Lumiya destroyed with her whip, and the second she caught in the Force. She lost the struggle, and the bust struck the whip from her hand. She was saved by Solo, however, who had agreed to learn her dark side teachings, after he envisioned multiple possible futures that resulted in the galaxy's descent into chaos and the death of his uncle, Luke Skywalker; only in his visions of Nelani Dinn's fall did Skywalker survive. Dinn realized that she was outmatched and fled with Solo after her, a [[Duel at The Home|confrontation]] that ended in her death. Lumiya met him shortly afterward in an airlock adjacent to the hangar where his shuttle was docked, and promised to honor the deceased with a burial suitable of a noble warrior. She noticed Solo's distress at what he had done and assured him that he had already begun to strengthen himself through his actions. As he departed with the unconscious but uninjured Ben Skywalker, Lumiya promised that upon his return to her asteroid, she would help Solo reach the level of Sith status that his grandfather had been unable to achieve. She retired to the Home's summit, where she met with the specter of Jacen's future self&mdash;her interpretation of him as a Sith. They recognized that, while the ghost was compelled to return to nonexistence, Lumiya's triumph over Solo ensured his eventual return, and that he would finally be granted a proper Sith name. The phantom disappeared, and Lumiya knew that through her victory, she had achieved balance befitting a Sith.<ref name=\"Betrayal\" />\n\n=====Sith Master=====\n{{Quote|Are there techniques to teach me?''\"<br />\"''Not techniques so much as awareness.

Clad in a red business suit and face obscured by scarf and veil, Lumiya concealed her Force presence and located Solo with Ben Skywalker in the [[Plaza of the Core]]. Introduced as \"Shira\" to the younger Jedi, who, for some reason, thought he recognized her but abandoned the notion before his dismissal, Lumiya hesitantly accepted an invitation to the Jedi Temple. Awed by the grandeur of the edifice, she entered, hid her dark side aura, and was led to the [[Room of a Thousand Fountains/Legends|Room of a Thousand Fountains]], where Solo explained that he would arrange for a discreet apartment for her on Coruscant where he desired for her to remain. She agreed but stressed the importance of haste on his part, now that she was confident in his decision to become Sith. Both of them had sensed the beginnings of the rapid degradation of galactic peace, and Lumiya&mdash;who scoffed at his suggestion of her involvement in recent terrorist attacks&mdash;felt certain that the next few weeks would determine what specific knowledge he required. They proceeded toward the Jedi Council Chamber, just as Luke Skywalker himself approached, who acted as though he sensed something slightly amiss. He promptly departed, none the wiser to the identity of the veiled woman at his nephew's flank. She scolded him for his recklessness and bid him farewell as she left the Temple and Coruscant for her home to collect and return with her personal belongings.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\n[[File:Dark_Lady_Lumiya.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith]]\nThe safe house that was provided for Lumiya was numbered [[Apartment three hundred seven twelve|712]] on the three-hundredth floor of Coruscant's [[Zorp House]] apartment complex. She returned to the galactic capital with her possessions, many of them artifacts of Sith origin, with which she furnished her new yet temporary abode.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Unknown to her apprentice or anyone else, however, Lumiya commandeered another dwelling on the 288th floor, which was to serve as the relay station for her observation of the comings and goings of Zorp House. She also infiltrated a set of unoccupied quarters in the building's third level, where she installed the [[Lumiya's datapad|modified and booby-trapped datapad]] with which she intended to [[Slicer/Legends|splice]] into the building's communications system. Her datapad was also programmed to penetrate the most secure of Alliance Military databanks, and from it she obtained [[Chasin Document|highly classified plans]] for the Alliance invasion of Commenor, a world that was slowly leaning toward Corellian allegiance. Lumiya fashioned a secret passage in one of the bedroom closets, which led to an intricate labyrinth of tunnels beneath the building and was guarded by a meter-long [[Durasteel/Legends|durasteel]] dart that was triggered to fire at a highly lethal velocity if ever the secrecy of her escape route was compromised.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nWhen next Lumiya met Jacen Solo it was in the [[Senate Building]], just after the announcement of Admiral [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon's]] retirement as [[Supreme Commander (Alliance/Republic)|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Galactic Alliance Defense Force]]. Again under the guise of \"Shira,\" she and Solo sat in lobby 513, down the hall from a meeting between members of the Jedi Council and the newly-appointed [[Supreme Commander (Alliance/Republic)|Supreme Commander]], [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] Admiral [[Cha Niathal]], whose promotion Lumiya had secretly engineered. With reports of his cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo's plans to have Centerpoint Station operable within the coming months broadcast all over the HoloNet, Jacen became increasingly determined to mitigate the repercussions of actions various members of his family visited upon the galaxy. Lumiya realized that Solo feared the similarities in his fall to the dark side and that of his grandfather, whose actions during the [[Operation: Knightfall|razing of the Jedi Temple]] he had witnessed during a recent [[flow-walking]] experience. Satisfied when he related his desire to still take Ben Skywalker as his eventual Sith apprentice, Lumiya was not completely in agreement with Solo's decision to remain with the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]] [[Police officer/Legends|police force]] in lieu of a more influential military appointment, given his relationship with Niathal. The meeting ended just then, and as the Jedi approached, Lumiya hid her dark orientation within Solo's Force illusion. Luke Skywalker greeted but did not otherwise acknowledge her, and she too remained indifferent as he conversed with Solo. When the Jedi Master departed, Lumiya accompanied Solo to congratulate Niathal.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\nSeveral days later, Lumiya met Solo in his apartment upon urgent request, as he had learned that his uncle was aware of the Dark Lady's presence on Coruscant. Concerned with the possibility that Skywalker might find her before her task was complete, Lumiya decided to accelerate Solo's Sith training. She projected a soothing Force illusion of deep blue, meditative light, through which the room was submerged in an underwater ambiance. Lumiya defined her role as Solo's guide on his path to Sith enlightenment and assured him that his was not the same destiny as his grandfather. When the issue of his own Sith apprentice arose, Jedi Mastery was the obstacle Lumiya felt it necessary for Solo to overcome to cement young Skywalker's tutelage under him. To that end, she planned to influence several non-Jedi supporters of Jacen Solo into lobbying with the Jedi Council on his behalf. Confident that Solo would soon reach the necessary level of understanding, the illusion ended, and she departed. Solo sought his Sith Master soon after a military engagement during the [[Blockade of Corellia|Corellian blockade]], in which he destroyed a civilian freighter after his sister, Jaina Solo, refused his direct order to fire. Jacen Solo felt compelled to court-martial his sister for her insubordination, which left him extremely troubled with recurrent bad dreams. Lumiya sensed his unrest as she emerged from an adjacent room to find him in her apartment, and advised him to recognize the significance of such decisions as he prepared to make his final sacrifice; among other things, the alienation of his sister was a small part of the price to pay for his role in the institution of an ordered galaxy. His dreams were inconsequential to Lumiya, so long as he was able to differentiate between them and Force visions, the latter through which he might find answers she was unable to provide. Solo was also troubled with the diminished faith in him of Ben Skywalker, who had witnessed Jacen Solo's inadvertent murder of a [[Ailyn Vel|prisoner]] during interrogation. Lumiya suggested that instead of seeking the boy's approval, Solo should place him in a situation where he had to discover the need for such extremes himself.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\nLumiya met with Solo regularly over the course of the next several weeks. On one particular day in her safe house apartment, she fondled the tassels that had initially ensnared Solo and listened as he related the frequency of his bad dreams, as well as his increasing obsession with the descent into the dark side of his grandfather. Lumiya realized that Solo's location-restrictive flow-walking technique limited his understanding of Darth Vader's fall, and she cautioned against any attempts to vindicate himself in that manner. She then handed the tassel artifact to Solo and commended his fulfillment of various aspects of the prophecy. The time was fast-approaching for the metaphoric immortalization of his love, the specifics of which Lumiya had no idea, but required the killing of a loved one whose death would bring unbearable suffering to their loved ones in turn.<ref name=\"Bloodlines\" />\n\n=====Machinations=====\n{{Quote|What you are doing with Jacen is so delicious&mdash;and so right for the Balance.|Alema Rar|Legacy of the Force: Tempest}}\n[[File:WhipCoiled.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lumiya with her coiled whip]]\nThe threat of full-blown civil war became more apparent over the course of a week as assassins under the employ of the planet [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui's]] [[True Victory Party]] colluded with Corellian terrorists to wreak havoc on Coruscant. Lumiya traveled through the [[Coruscant underworld|Coruscant Underlevels]] in pursuit of Jacen Solo, who had gone to meet with his friend and spy, the [[World Brain]],<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> to learn what the Yuuzhan Vong creature had discovered about the activities of the terrorists in the Underlevels. Unknown to Lumiya, she was preceded by the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] Dark Jedi [[Alema Rar]], who had stalked Solo with hopes of killing him to exact revenge against his parents. The Dark Lady eliminated three feral Underlevel residents who attempted to impede her progress upon Rar's suggestion before she noticed the Twi'lek's presence. She hid with a muted Force aura on a balcony in the shadows of the fogged cesspool wherein resided the World Brain, just as Rar emerged from the corridor and prepared to fire her [[blowgun]] at Solo. Lumiya used the Force at that same moment to hurl the Jedi clear of the wayward dart, which pierced the eye of the World Brain and sent the creature into death spasms as the poison circulated. Now aware of the assassin's location, Lumiya alerted Solo to her presence, and the Sith apprentice momentarily deterred Rar's escape with a torrent of Force lighting. Lumiya rebuked any further exertion of his wrath and reminded him that preservation of the World Brain as an intelligence asset was of far greater import than revenge. He resisted, and Lumiya denounced him as a slave to his emotions for his desire to seek justice for a wounded friend. Solo relented but promised vengeance against the True Victory Party and its leader, a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] called [[Reh'mwa]], whom he suspected had sent the assassin, before he and Lumiya descended into the World Brain's pool in an attempt to save its life.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nFrom the information Jacen Solo received from his spy, Lumiya was given a list of and asked to kill a number of influential Bothan dignitaries in conspiracy with Corellian insurgents. The terrorists had also discovered the World Brain's treachery as the Galactic Alliance Guard's spy and prepared to move their entire network against it. Despite the best efforts of the Sith, however, the World Brain succumbed to the poison and died in a week's time. Lumiya was summoned by her apprentice to meet him in the [[Fellowship Plaza]] of Coruscant's [[Senate District]] to discuss the ramifications, and she was asked to expedite the completion of the list, as Solo believed that the Corellians would not reveal themselves if they learned that the World Brain was already dead. She agreed, but openly recognized the declaration of war from Bothawui that would inevitably follow. As Solo departed for a meeting with Admiral Niathal that was to include the commission of his own [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]], the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']], Lumiya's attention shifted to a [[Duel in the Fellowship Plaza|commotion]] behind her, between two apparently spying females: a [[Chev]] Jedi and a deformed, blue-skinned, lightsaber-wielding Twi'lek. The Dark Lady urged her apprentice to exit as she activated her lightwhip and prepared to deal with the Twi'lek, who beckoned Lumiya to stop the fleeing Jedi Master, [[Tresina Lobi]], from reporting to the High Council details of the conversation on which she had just eavesdropped. The Dark Jedi blasted Lobi with Force lightning but was incapacitated by an urn thrown telekinetically by the Chev. Lumiya began a duel with the Jedi, but was methodically driven back by the larger woman, and forced to deactivate her weapon when the Twi'lek interposed herself between the combatants and was burned across the body by the whip's still-hot energy filaments. Lobi [[Cho sun/Legends|severed]] Lumiya's weapon arm just then and took position for a killing strike, but she was again parried by the Dark Jedi, which gave the Sith time to recover her lightwhip and wield it with her remaining limb. Forced into retreat and momentarily distracted by the being behind her, Lobi faltered, and Lumiya [[Cho mok|sheared both of her legs off]] at the knee, just before her accomplice killed her with a [[Sai cha/Legends|decapitating strike]]. The Twi'lek then introduced herself as Alema Rar and pledged her assistance to the downfall of Jacen Solo, an offer which Lumiya warily accepted.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nThe next morning, Lumiya gave the list of Bothan ambassadors to Rar that she might complete the assassinations in her stead. She then joined her apprentice on board the ''Anakin Solo'' to the [[Hapes/Legends|sovereign world]] of the [[Hapes Cluster/Legends|Hapes Cluster]], where upon arrival, Lumiya retired from the [[Command Salon]] with Solo to her own cabin in deference to the presence of [[Queen Mother]] [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]], on whose life an attempt had recently been made. The Dark Lady's involvement in Lobi's death was meanwhile uncovered an hour later when the Chev's dismembered corpse was found in Fellowship Plaza by [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|Coruscant Security Force]] [[Detective/Legends|Detectives]] [[Gwad Raatu]] and [[Chal Tozr]], who notified Jedi Masters Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker. Their subsequent investigation led them to believe that Lumiya and a female accomplice had stalked their son Ben. They discovered and conducted a preliminary search of her safe house, which yielded nothing more than an expensive gown. Under the assumption she had fled the planet, they sliced into the dwelling's computer and stumbled upon a list of names that corroborated Lumiya's complicity in the Bothan assassination affair. Further scrutiny revealed her high-level access to the records and resources of the Galactic Alliance Guard, to which they learned her apartment was a registered safe house. The Jedi surmised that Lumiya had not infiltrated the GAG at all, but had actually been working with them, possibly under the full awareness of Jacen Solo.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\n===Lumiya revealed===\n====Reunion====\n{{Main|Duel on Roqoo Depot}}\n{{Quote|You've caused me a lot of pain over the years, Skywalker.

While en route to Hapes with him on board the ''Anakin Solo'', the Skywalkers related their discoveries and decision to remove their son from active GAG duty. Jacen Solo relented and scheduled a rendezvous between parents and child on the [[Roqoo Depot]] refueling station, deep within the Hapes Cluster. The meeting was a twofold trap, however, as Lumiya agreed to also venture to Roqoo Depot to secretly oversee Ben Skywalker's safe passage to the ''Anakin''. Within an hour of the Skywalkers' and Queen Mother's departures, the Star Destroyer prepared to jump to the [[Relephon Moons]] to deal with the [[Heritage Council]], the instigators of the recent Hapan coup attempt. Lumiya had returned to the vessel with Alema Rar, with whom she fashioned two dead-man relays from as many [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton detonator charges]], in preparation for an imminent confrontation with the Skywalkers. The devices, which Lumiya intended to serve as fail-safes should either woman fall in battle, were configured to detonate upon the cessation of the wearer's vital signs, thus ensuring the station's destruction and the deaths of those in close proximity. With the relays affixed to a combat vest for each of them, Lumiya and Rar left the ''Anakin Solo'' for Roqoo Depot.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nDressed in dark raiment with their faces hidden behind cowls, the two darksiders entered the refueling station cantina, Force presences muted, just after the Skywalkers. Lumiya hurled a grenade at them upon sight, which detonated and scattered Jedi and patron alike. She maimed two beings with her lightwhip as they recovered and vowed to kill all remaining bystanders but for the Skywalkers' surrender. The Sith Lady redirected the cantina patrons' terror toward her opponents, but Luke Skywalker attacked nonetheless, while Mara Jade Skywalker closed in on her flank&mdash;both Jedi armed with lightsaber and shoto. She kept the civilians between them, however, and the Skywalkers were unable to mount a successful offensive without killing innocent beings. While Lumiya furiously fought with Luke Skywalker, Rar hid within a Force shadow just outside the cantina entrance and fired her blowgun at the unsuspecting Mara Jade Skywalker, who was saved by the Force-warning of her husband. In a moment's distraction, Lumiya severed the male Skywalker's weapon hand and brought him down with a critical slash across the body. As she moved to finish him, Lumiya was shot five times with a blaster rifle found by the downed Jedi. The Grand Master's determination to kill her was stayed by his wife, who revealed the same type of combat fail-safe strapped to Lumiya that Mara Jade Skywalker had discovered on the defeated Rar. The Jedi fled minutes before Lumiya and the Twi'lek, whose tracks were covered in the explosion that resulted from the abandonment of their dead man relays at Roqoo Depot.<ref name=\"Tempest\" />\n\nIn the days that followed the events on Roqoo Depot, Lumiya returned to her asteroid retreat near Bimmiel, where a full staff of medical droids waited to treat her injuries. A combination of healing trances and her enhanced metabolism also assisted in her convalescence, but she remained as yet unhealed, and in pain. As she lay in recovery, Lumiya sensed the touch of Jacen Solo through the Force and responded with a phantom of herself projected to his cabin on board the ''Anakin Solo''. With the galaxy still on the brink of war, Solo expressed concern with the direction his training was taking him and uncertainty regarding whether or not his cousin&mdash;whom he recently realized could serve as his necessary sacrifice&mdash;was the most appropriate choice for apprenticeship. To that end, Lumiya offered to coordinate a test of Solo's design for young Skywalker; a [[Mission for the Amulet of Kalara|mission]] to [[Drewwa]], a moon of [[Almania/Legends|Almania]], for the recovery of a Sith artifact known as the [[Amulet of Kalara]]. She hired a Bothan called [[Byalfin Dyur]] to steal the amulet and give it to a courier named [[Faskus Olvidan|Faskus]], with instructions to bring it to specific coordinates of Ziost. Lumiya's agents planted seeds of disinformation in various locations, so that if her activities were discovered by the Jedi, they would not be able to easily thwart her. When next she received report of Dyur's progress, Lumiya learned that Faskus had been killed, but [[Kiara Olvidan|his daughter]], an unexpected variable in Lumiya's scheme, had since become Skywalker's responsibility. The specific instructions Lumiya gave to Jacen Solo with regard to Skywalker's mission had not accounted for the girl's presence, and she realized that his inherent benevolence went against the necessary Sith survival instinct; she therefore ordered Dyur to kill them both. In the meanwhile, both her [[Lumiya's second apartment|second]] and [[Lumiya's bedrock-level quarters|third]] safe house apartments within Zorp House on Coruscant were discovered by the Skywalkers. Along with the secret passages of Lumiya's they learned led discreetly from the complex, the Dark Lady's explosive and poison-rigged datapad was found, with which she had intercepted various communications and hacked into the Galactic Alliance Defense network with a [[Three seven nine aitch oh ell forty-four underscore bee nine two one|high-level GAG access code]].<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\n====Interference====\n{{Quote|I know this is going to sound strange, but I haven't found any indication this war was precipitated by outside forces [&hellip;]''\"<br />\"''So that means no puppet master?''\"<br />\"''It means that war itself is not the puppet master's original plan, or at least not his fault.

To further agitate the situation, Lumiya disguised herself as a Hapan noblewoman and Bothan sympathizer, and contacted Bothan Deputy Intelligence Leader [[Tathak K'roylan]] via holocomm, with information that would prove vital in Bothawui's attempt to release their fleets beneath the Galactic Alliance's notice as well as an offer to assist them in that endeavor by diverting the Alliance's attention. To earn a measure of K'roylan's trust, Lumiya provided previously-undisclosed details with regard to the string of Bothan assassinations on Coruscant. While she herself had been intimately involved with the deaths, sanction had come from Colonel Solo of the Galactic Alliance Guard, to whom also belonged the classified records Lumiya had given K'roylan. Confident that the Bothans would eventually do so, she provided K'roylan with information on how to contact her when the need arose and ended the link.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\n[[File:Battle_of_Gilatter_VIII.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lumiya engages Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Gilatter VIII]]\nShe then contacted Jacen Solo specifically, to whom was transmitted what she called the \"Syo package.\" Still in the Hapan noblewoman role, Lumiya next opened a transmission to Commenor, another world that had also recently joined the Corellian secession movement. In the subsequent conversation with [[Prime Minister/Legends|Prime Minister]] [[Fyor Rodan]], she provided the details of the Chasin Document, the means by which the Galactic Alliance planned to conquer Commenor. She advised that she would contact him again in several days with details of Corellian fleet movements which, with the aid of Rodan's forces, would succeed against the Alliance. Confident that Rodan's superiors would validate her information, she ended the link with the Prime Minister and created a Force phantom of herself that she sent to the [[Veterans' Mental Care Hospital]] in Coruscant's [[Galactic City]], where she influenced a sleeping female [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] [[Unidentified Quarren employee|employee]] into consciousness, then action. Within minutes, the Quarren accessed computer files and issued instructions to various beings for the Sith Mistress, which included the acquisition of clothing, documentation, and transportation, all to be made ready and waiting for her command. Lumiya then returned the unwitting Quarren to her office and restored her slumber, before she went in search of the recently-admitted former Alliance Defense Fleet Admiral Matric Klauskin. Capitalizing on the insanity in him she herself had created, Lumiya convinced him to leave the hospital, return to his homeworld of Commenor, and participate in the war on behalf of the Corellian insurrection, all by the means she had just provisioned. Klauskin subsequently used his credentials to board and seize command of the Alliance frigate [[Shamunaar (frigate)|''Shamunaar'']], a coordination vessel for all the Alliance's reconnaissance and fighting forces in the Bothawui system. The Admiral then relinquished control of ''Shamunaar'' to the Bothans, more specifically Tathak K'roylan, who assimilated the frigate into his fleet and implemented it in [[Battle of Corellia (Second Galactic Civil War)|an attack]] on Alliance forces in the Corellian system, which ultimately resulted in the end of the longstanding blockade.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nFollowing the battle of Corellia, wherein Bothawui and Commenor participated on behalf of the Confederation, the declaration of war that had initially been enacted against Corellia was extended to include the world's new allies. In addition, [[Adumar/Legends|Adumar]], Bespin, and [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]] withdrew their support of the Alliance in favor of the Confederacy, and a top-secret meeting was scheduled to elect an undisputed [[Supreme Commander of the Confederation military]]. The Alliance learned of the meeting's location at a [[Gilatter VIII resort satellite|resort satellite]] around the [[Gilatter VIII|primary star]] of the [[Gilatter system]], and they made swift preparations for an ambush. Coordinated by Admiral Niathal and Colonel Jacen Solo, the military action was to include Jedi [[StealthX]] pilots acting as reconnaissance fighters just prior to the arrival of the makeshift Alliance fleet, led by Niathal's flagship, the ''[[Galactic Voyager]]'', and the ''Anakin Solo''. Lumiya, who was now fully healed and had sensed Jacen Solo's anxiety over the situation, met him on Coruscant and agreed to help him infiltrate the resort, that he might act as a distraction from the Alliance forces massing in orbit around the star. She joined him on board his Star Destroyer to Gilatter VIII and, under the aliases of [[Silfinia Ell|Silfinia]] and [[Najack Ell]], the pair inserted themselves into the stronghold of the enemy. To cover more ground as they canvassed the gathering, Lumiya separated from her charge. Shortly after their arrival, however, the meeting was revealed to be a trap set for the Alliance; the Confederation had already chosen its General [[Turr Phennir]] as Supreme Commander at a previous engagement, and were also well aware of&mdash;and prepared for&mdash;the Alliance assault. Lumiya received a Force-warning from Solo and prepared to help him defend against the [[Corellian Security Force|Corellian Security officers]] that had swarmed him, but was surprised to find Alema Rar also present and intent on killing Mara Jade Skywalker, who was on station with her husband, as well as the fast approaching Han Solo. Confident that their presences at the meeting would force the Solos and Skywalkers to delay their departure, the two darksiders, weapons in hand, dived into the fray.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nLumiya confronted Luke, who was dismayed to learn that she had not died at Roqoo Depot, and the two engaged in a vicious duel. Skywalker was convinced that Lumiya's actions stemmed from a hatred nursed over decades, an assumption she vehemently denied and attempted to prove with the deactivation of her lightwhip, and an offer to kill her then and there. When the Jedi Grand Master refused, Lumiya offered her hand to him in an expression of amnesty, a gesture he hesitatingly returned. However, the momentary distraction provided Jacen Solo with the opportunity to escape and return to the ''Anakin Solo'', just as Lumiya had intended. As they held hands, an errant [[YV-666 light freighter/Legends|YV-666 light freighter]] crashed through the [[Transparisteel/Legends|transparisteel]] dome of the station's main hall, and Lumiya used her reignited lightwhip to rend an escape route through an adjacent wall. In the utter chaos that ensued as the structure collapsed and a [[Battle of Gilatter VIII|space battle]] raged, the Dark Lady appropriated an abandoned airspeeder and contacted Solo, who provided landing authorization for her vessel on the ''Anakin Solo''. She joined her apprentice in his private office and counseled him to maintain better control of the anger he radiated because of his perceived failure at Gilatter VIII. Frustrated with his own fallibility in combat, Solo desired to be unbeatable, despite its impossibility. Lumiya revealed that once he achieved full Mastery, the Sith ability to totally coordinate battle through the Force&mdash;not the rudimentary [[Battle meditation|meditative invigoration]] akin to highly-skilled Force users&mdash;would be his to command, but not before he performed his blood sacrifice and assumed his Sith identity. In the silence that marked the next few moments, Lumiya recognized that fear of his emotions had stricken her apprentice, not indecision over whom it was he had to sacrifice. She left him to contemplate the significance of her words, disappointed by the possibility that he was not quite as ready to embrace his destiny as she had previously believed.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\n====Closing in====\n{{Quote|Hello, little housewife.|Lumiya to Mara Jade Skywalker|Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice}}\n[[File:Lumiya_AOSWG2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lumiya brandishing her lightwhip]]\nLumiya remained in her cabin on board the ''Anakin Solo'' and was soon unsettled by a [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|disturbance in the Force]] that was the approach of Ben Skywalker, who had returned from his mission at the helm of an ancient [[Sith Meditation Sphere]]. The vehicle, which had searched for Solo, had instead found Lumiya&mdash;whom it recognized as Sith&mdash;and came to for instructions. Lumiya felt that it was somehow intertwined with her apprentice's destiny and offered it to him, despite her own fascination with the Sphere, or simply \"[[Ship (Sith Meditation Sphere)|Ship]],\" as it preferred to be called. Although the Force suggested the vessel's insignificance in her own future, Lumiya kept it pursuant to Solo's refusal and silently vowed to look after the craft until which time he was ready for it. Immediate haste was made from the ''Anakin Solo'' for her asteroid retreat, and Lumiya quickly noticed Alema Rar fast on her tail. She did nothing to deter the insane Twi'lek's pursuit as the Meditation Sphere approached the Home, and grudgingly allowed Rar entry but also refused her safe haven. Rar, who had nurtured an obsession with [[The Balance|revenge]] against the Solo&ndash;Skywalker clan for her various disfigurements, planned to work alongside Jacen, but was sternly rebuked under penalty of death by Lumiya. The Dark Lady would not chance potential disaster wrought by Rar's madness with Solo's ascendancy nigh at hand, and channeled the Dark Jedi's reckless abandon into something useful: surveillance on the Colonel's activities in Lumiya's stead. She confiscated Rar's easily recognizable [[Conqueror-class assault ship|''Conqueror''-class assault ship]] and gave the Twi'lek a less conspicuous courier shuttle, with instructions to first track the ''Anakin Solo''.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\nJacen Solo's relentless campaigns against the Confederation left his forces vastly depleted, and he faced numerous obstacles in his bids for replenished resources. To circumvent the red-tape, Solo drafted an amendment to a procurement regulation that eliminated the hindrances he so often encountered. He also capitalized on an opportunity to attach a more insidious amendment to the original one which allowed him to bypass the Galactic Senate if ever he or Admiral Niathal felt the need to change any legislation within existing budgets, quickly and decisively. Anonymity was required on his part, and Lumiya went to the Senate meeting in his place, to make certain that [[Item 357|amendment number 357]] on the 563-item agenda passed without issue. She received a silent comlink from him, and gave her assurance that everything was proceeding as planned. Via that same open connection, Lumiya was privy to a conversation between the Colonel and Mara Jade Skywalker, the latter of whom confronted Solo about Lumiya's proven involvement with GAG. From the meeting she also learned that Byalfin Dyur, whom she suspected to hear unfavorable news from soon, had been defeated by Ben Skywalker. Upon Mara Jade's departure, Lumiya related her conclusion that Ben Skywalker was definitely unfit to eventually succeed Solo as Lord of the Sith. At that moment, a sentient's rights [[Citizen Watch|advocate]] interrupted the procurement council meeting to address one part of Solo's amendment, but failed to notice the subtle wording he secretly implemented that would allow him to change other legislation. When the potential for opposition in the gallery manifested, Lumiya used the Force to persuade the participants otherwise, and amendment 357 passed. Unbeknownst to the members of the Senate, Solo planned to seize control of the Galactic Alliance with his newfound legislative power.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\nA prime opportunity presented itself when GAG intelligence officers inadvertently intercepted a secret conversation between Chief of State Cal Omas and Corellian President [[Dur Gejjen]], during which they agreed to meet personally on the planet [[Vulpter/Legends|Vulpter]] and plan the assassinations of Colonel Solo and Admiral Niathal. In response, Solo drafted an amendment to the part of the [[Emergency Measures Act]] which granted him the authority to detain anyone who posed a valid risk to the sanctity of the Galactic Alliance, to include Heads of State. With Niathal as his co-conspirator, Solo planned to arrest Omas on exactly those charges, and prior to his ascension to Dark Lord of the Sith&mdash;much to Lumiya's chagrin. She cautioned him against the haste of his decision, as she believed that he had not yet achieved the necessary power to rule undisputed. In the interim, Lumiya agreed to act as a distraction to the Jedi from Solo's next few moves and requested an item of young Skywalker's with which to antagonize his parents. She was given a pair of his boots, and at four that next morning, sneaked into the quarters of a sleeping Luke Skywalker to plant the evidence. Skywalker sensed her moments after her departure, utterly bewildered by Lumiya's apparently uninhibited access to his son. He contacted his wife and together they made conscious efforts to find and eliminate Lumiya. A powerful wake in the Force led Jade Skywalker to [[Hesperidium/Legends|Hesperidium]], a resort moon in Coruscant's orbit, and into direct [[Duel on Hesperidium|confrontation]] with the Dark Lady of the Sith. They fought furiously, and when Lumiya was positioned to receive a killing stroke, the Sith Meditation Sphere she had traveled on intervened and throttled Jade Skywalker. Lumiya escaped with serious injury, leaving her mutually battered opponent unfinished, but determined to continue pursuit.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n====Victory====\n{{Quote|My work and my life are done, Jacen. I'd really welcome a rest.|Lumiya|Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice}}\nImmediately following the meeting between Omas and Gejjen on Vulpter, the latter was [[Mission to Vulpter|assassinated]] by Ben Skywalker under orders of Jacen Solo. Upon the Chief of State's return to Coruscant and on the same night his amendment became law, Jacen Solo personally [[Solo-Niathal coup|arrested]] Cal Omas for suspicion of intended malice against the Galactic Alliance. He and Niathal then declared themselves Joint Chief of State, to serve for the duration of the investigation into Omas' [[Treason/Legends|treason]]. Fully healed from the wounds suffered in her bout with Mara Jade Skywalker, Lumiya returned to Coruscant on board the Meditation Sphere, which she hid in an abandoned warehouse, and met with Solo to discuss the implications of the recent attempts to distract the Jedi, a conversation which was secretly overheard by Ben Skywalker. Her next meeting with Solo was in his apartment, where they again mulled over the final stage of his transition, the immortalization of his love. Lumiya had begun to feel like the Force was brimming for a change, and had become increasingly disturbed by Solo's predilection with the maneuverings of non Force-users. The Colonel's recent campaigns had left him exhausted, and Lumiya agreed to keep watch over Admiral Niathal while he took an undisturbed, forty-eight hour sabbatical. After his departure, Lumiya explored the apartment for a time before she too left and returned to the Meditation Sphere, with intentions of following her apprentice on his secret journey. An eighteen-hour venture through the [[Perlemian Trade Route/Legends|Perlemian Trade Route]] eventually ended in the Hapes Cluster, and Lumiya remained in orbit as Solo landed at the [[Fountain Palace]] of the namesake planet. Submersed in meditation, she was suddenly stricken through the Force by an outpouring of intense love, and she realized that the emotion had originated from Solo. The Sith Mistress deduced, much to her dismay, that he had gone to Hapes to be with his lover, Tenel Ka. Even more disturbing was the revelation that Solo had two loves on Hapes&mdash;the second being a [[Allana Solo|child]] illegitimately conceived with the Queen Mother.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n[[File:Lukekilllumiya.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Lumiya's final confrontation with Luke Skywalker]]\nIt had been that same child whom Solo dreaded having to sacrifice, and Lumiya mistakenly believed that he had come to Hapes for said purpose. Actually, he had only come to spend time with his secret family. Upon his departure from Hapes, however, Solo's StealthX was attacked by another with Mara Jade Skywalker at the helm, who had recently confronted him about his descent into darkness. Lumiya intervened just then and, with a command to Ship, caused a hull-breach in Skywalker's StealthX. Battle had carried the combatants to orbit over the nearby planet [[Kavan]], where Jade Skywalker's starfighter was forced planetside as it vented atmosphere. Lumiya assured Solo that she would make certain his business on Hapes stayed unknown and was answered with eight proton torpedoes locked and closing in on the Meditation Sphere. Ship, however, would not abide the treachery of the Dark Lord-to-be. As Solo sped after Mara Jade Skywalker, the vessel prepared to retaliate despite Lumiya's countermand, but was stayed by the dissuasion of Ben Skywalker, who had covertly joined in his mother's pursuit. Rendered helpless by the insubordination of a Sith ship that responded to a Jedi boy's orders, Lumiya was forced to the surface of Kavan and held captive within the Meditation Sphere, unable to join in the hunt for Skywalker's mother.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\nLumiya soon afterward [[Death convulsion|felt]] the Jedi Master's death, accompanied by a subtle yet telling shift in the Force: Solo's sacrifice had been made at Mara Jade Skywalker's expense. Ben Skywalker's hold over Ship was immediately broken, and Lumiya, with a new serenity about her, commanded the Sphere to find the new Dark Lord of the Sith. They met on Ziost, where Lumiya gave Solo instructions on how to proceed. She offered to serve as one last distraction from his total consolidation of power by misrepresenting herself as Mara Jade Skywalker's killer, in full acceptance of the certainty of her own demise at the hand of Luke Skywalker, and made a return journey to Hapan space. With her Force-presence no longer hidden, Skywalker soon found Lumiya and forced her to land on the nearby planet [[Terephon]]. She removed her veil as she emerged from Ship, and with little left to say to one another due to both being exhausted, the Dark Lady of the Sith and Jedi Grand Master [[Duel on Terephon|dueled]] for a final time. Lumiya was quickly forced onto the defensive as Skywalker drove her to the edge of the precipice on which they fought. When she lost her footing and fell, dropping her lightwhip into the chasm in the process, Skywalker saved her, only to ensure her death by decapitating her as she recovered.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|I've won.''\"<br />\"''And so I must go.

Still, when she realized that Solo had had a child, and that it had been the child's death he had contemplated while on his path to Mastery, the Dark Lady was moved to tears. She thought Solo's choice of soap, a plain antiseptic, was both touching and funny, and she planned to teach him to indulge himself more when he became a Sith Lord. She was intrigued by how austere his quarters became each time she visited and resolved that if Solo had discarded his personal effects as a symbol of the end of his old life and the beginning of his new one, it was just as well.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\nLumiya often pondered whom it was that Jacen Solo had to sacrifice and recognized the possibility that, in the way of the Sith, she might be that individual. She also became increasingly concerned with his choice of apprentice and was adamant in her belief that Ben Skywalker was the most suitable candidate, given his hereditary Force potential and his preoccupation with impressing Solo, the latter of which she felt made Skywalker a slave to his emotions. Lumiya praised Solo's ability to control the boy, but also cautioned him to not be hindered by his affection for his young cousin. When Solo suggested that he might abandon the prospect of Skywalker as his apprentice for one whom he believed would serve him better, such as Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila, Lumiya responded with extreme disapproval. She eventually abandoned that perspective after the conclusion of Skywalker's quest for the Amulet of Kalara.<ref name=\"Exile\" /> She doubted Solo's commitment to the Sith from time to time and reminded him that theirs was a cause far greater than the lives of his friends and family.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Despite his total mastery of the Force and potential for Sith greatness, Jacen Solo's preference to engage ordinary beings on their terms as opposed to dominating them through the Force frustrated Lumiya immensely.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n====Alema Rar====\n{{Quote|Broken.''\"<br />\"''It's broken, all right.|Ship, and Lumiya|Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice}}\n[[File:GorogRar2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Alema Rar, the \"broken\" one]]\nFrom the moment of their first meeting, Lumiya was aghast by Alema Rar's fragile mental state&mdash;a sentiment shared by Ship&mdash;and resolved to delicate handling more often than not, lest she provoke the wrath of a madwoman. She was especially disturbed with the fragmented hive-mind quality she discovered upon a mental probe of Rar's mind, and she likened the Twi'lek's Force presence to that of shards of broken glass in her mouth. Lumiya was initially wary of the Twi'lek's motives and made a point to reveal only the smallest of details with regard to her own plans, going so far as entertain the notion of killing Rar herself to eliminate the potential liability she posed.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> Frequently frustrated with Rar's short attention span, incessant questioning into the agenda of the Sith,<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> and her obsessive desire for \"Balance,\" Lumiya nonetheless realized the benefits in Rar as an accomplice and readily exploited her unique espionage and assassination talents,<ref name=\"Exile\" /> even though the latter believed that Lumiya had quite the misunderstanding about the extent of their partnership. The relationship was something of a strain on the Dark Lady's patience; Lumiya refused to provide Rar safe haven, and when it seemed as though it would be impossible to otherwise reason with the Dark Jedi, Lumiya acted as insane as Rar, a tactic that immediately sobered her with fear.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" /> Lumiya was often moved to insult Rar, despite her apparent mental instability, but when her pejoratives became slightly more scathing than Rar cared to tolerate, Lumiya obliged her with a demanded apology.<ref name=\"Tempest\" /> Although the nature of their unique deformities differed considerably, Lumiya still felt a modicum of kinship, even pity, for Alema Rar, and she urged the Twi'lek to fuel her rage with the memories of her myriad losses.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n====Ship====\n{{Quote|What a magnificent piece of engineering. It says it ''found'' me.|Lumiya|Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice}}\nIn a galaxy where the Sith had been all but extinct for more than four thousand years, Ship was overjoyed to discover the existence of Lumiya, whom it recognized as a descendant of its creators and came to for instructions. The initial sense Lumiya had of Ship unsettled her, but when she determined what it was, she was moved by its seeming care for her. Upon her appropriation of the vessel, she immediately felt a sense of comradeship with Ship and expressed many unguarded emotions&mdash;a rare thing for Lumiya&mdash;when it appeared to show her a measure of affection. Lumiya and Ship conversed frequently throughout their journeys, and the Dark Lady grew annoyed with its relentless questioning into the whereabouts of the other Sith, or \"dark ones,\" as it referred to them. Lumiya usually agreed with its character assessments of various individuals, and was pleased to learn that Ship had detected faint residual traces of darkness within both Mara Jade Skywalker, a former Emperor's Hand, and her son Ben, whom Lumiya had discounted as unworthy of Sith apprenticeship. However, when Ship later realized that Lumiya lacked sufficient Sith knowledge to be considered a Master by its standards, and therefore was unable to fully command it, Lumiya lost control of the Meditation Sphere to a mere Jedi Padawan.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Ace pilot===\n{{Quote|She's the finest pilot I've ever seen behind the stick, and I'd say that even if I didn't know her so well.|Myrette Davani|Carida: Heavy Duty}}\nA woman with a natural talent for astrogation,<ref name=\"LDSE\" /> Shira Brie spent countless hours in combat simulation to sharpen her piloting skills.

In [[2001]], veteran ''Star Wars'' writer [[Abel G.

When co-authors [[Aaron Allston]], [[Troy Denning]], and [[Karen Traviss]], each of whom shared a third of the series, began their collaboration, the idea of a being known only at that point as \"the wizard\" was intended to portray Jacen Solo's Sith Master. Lumiya had not been considered; in fact, ideas for beings of other species were given, including [[Anzat (species)|Anzati]].<ref name=\"BetrayalArticle\">{{InsiderCite|88|Betrayal (article)|Betrayal}}</ref> Executive director of [[Lucas Licensing]] [[Sue Rostoni]], however, suggested that the trio use Lumiya as their wizard character, an idea they accepted. For the first of the nine novels, titled ''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'', Allston toyed around with how to feasibly associate a character of thirty or forty in-universe years prior to a character of the current era, specifically Jacen Solo. He credited the rich history of the Sith and the dark side in ''Star Wars'' with providing him enough material to create a character of utmost complexity in Lumiya for ''Betrayal''.<ref name=\"BetrayalArticle\" /> Traviss noted the pleasure she took in writing characters with whom she was not previously familiar, Lumiya included.

''The Official Star Wars Fact File 111'' says that Lumiya was shot down by Luke Skywalker during their mission to Cloud City, when in fact she was shot down during the battle of the secret armada, which appeared in ''Star Wars 61: Screams in the Void''. While Lumiya's Databank entry claims that she was recovered from her destroyed TIE fighter by Darth Vader's agents, ''The Emperor's Pawns'' states that Vader himself discovered Brie in the damaged starfighter. Despite the sources that identify her eyes as green,<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /><ref name=\"TEA\" /> Mara Jade describes them as \"cold gray\" in ''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force''. ''Lumiya: Dark Star of the Empire'' lists her height as 6&nbsp;ft., or 1.83 meters, as late as the battle of Endor, but ''The Official Star Wars Fact File 111'' and ''The New Essential Chronology'' lists it as 5&nbsp;ft. 2 in., or 1.6 meters. Furthermore, the novel ''[[Legacy of the Force: Tempest]]'', written by Troy Denning, states that Alema Rar is considerably taller than Lumiya, but the ''New Essential Chronology'' has them both as the same height at 1.6 meters, and Lumiya is the taller of the two based on the 1.83 meters given for her in ''Lumiya: Dark Star of the Empire''. ''Dark Star of the Empire'' also mistakenly identifies Lumiya as having been previously a Jedi Knight that fell to the dark side of the Force. The final duel between Luke Skywalker and Lumiya that occurs in ''Sacrifice'' describes her as having removed her cowl to fight bare-faced, while the depiction of the same confrontation in ''Jedi vs.
