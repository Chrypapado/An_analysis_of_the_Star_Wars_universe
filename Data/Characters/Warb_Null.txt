Originally a [[Metallurgy/Legends|metalworking]] student with great aspirations, Dovos' plans were interrupted when he discovered an ancient [[Sith spellbook|tome]] in the wilds of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], wherein resided a sinister [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Force ghost|spirit]] that tricked the young man into constructing a suit of [[Sith trooper armor/Legends|armor]] tainted with the [[Sith magic]]. Upon donning the battle garb, Dovos was transformed by the specter into an unwitting servant of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and became the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] '''Warb Null'''.\n\nIn his new life as an agent of the Sith, Warb Null was chosen as the guardian of the long-[[Death/Legends|dead]] [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Freedon Nadd]], whom Null served as the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] of his legions of [[darksider]]s. He led the [[Naddist]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]] in a [[Freedon Nadd Uprising|planetwide rebellion]] against the forces of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], during which he [[Funeral of Amanoa|recovered]] the [[Sith sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of both [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Amanoa]] of Onderon and Freedon Nadd. However, he was soon afterward confronted by [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], to whom Null swiftly fell in [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]]. Null's death was, in the end, insignificant to the spirit of Nadd, who felt the [[Armor/Legends|armor]]-clad [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] had fulfilled his purpose.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Do not worry, my disciple.

His [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] was one with a rich history of allegiance to the ancient [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and was ruled from the walled-[[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] by a [[Onderon Royal Family|royal line]] that descended directly from a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] named [[Freedon Nadd]]. Sometime before the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], Dovos traveled to a wild region of the planet during his studies, where he stumbled upon a hidden [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] treasury. The young Onderonian was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] himself, and one particular [[Sith artifact/Legends|artifact]] piqued his interest&mdash;an ancient [[Sith spellbook|Sith magic book]] hand-written by a member of the old [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]]. Dovos stole the [[Book/Legends|tome]] and returned home, desperate to uncover the secrets hidden deep inside the ancient document.<ref name=\"totjc\" />\n\nDovos was initially enamored by the book, though soon his fascination turned into complete obsession. He spent [[Standard year/Legends|years]] attempting to break the coding, until he had forsaken his metalworking studies and lost interest in the other aspects of his life. Eventually, he deciphered the Sith lore and began construction on a set of specialized [[Sith trooper armor/Legends|armor]] that would grant its wearer great power. In his forge deep beneath Onderon's surface, Dovos used basic [[Sith magic]], combined with his extensive knowledge of alloys and metals, to forge the [[Color/Legends|blackened]] helmet, breastplate, and gauntlets of a massive suit of [[Armor/Legends|armor]]. Many attempts were made by the young man, and many resulted in failure, until, after working for [[Standard day/Legends|days]] on end in a final try, Shas Dovos's suit of armor was complete. However, he doubted his worthiness to wear it, as he was unsure of his grasp of the Sith [[magic]] necessary to produce such a weapon.<ref name=\"totjc\" />\n\nDovos soon overcame his doubts and reasoned that if it had not been for him, the knowledge behind the armor would still be hidden in obscurity; if anyone deserved to wear it, he did. In fact, Dovos had been the unwitting victim of a decade of manipulation, and was bewildered when the agent of that manipulation suddenly spoke to him. Identifying itself as the [[spirit protector]] and keeper of the spellbook, the [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] [[Force ghost|apparition]] revealed its clandestine interaction to Dovos and claimed that but for its intervention, the tome would have succumbed to the ravages of [[Time/Legends|time]] millennia ago. Stricken with fear, Dovos finally realized the dangers of owning such property as a Sith spellbook. He learned that it had been the Sith protector's slow and subtle influence, as well as its interference with his [[Dream/Legends|dreams]] and thoughts, that led to his obsession with the tome and subsequent smithing of the tainted armor. Dovos then became the spirit protector's unwilling [[Sith apprentice/Legends|disciple]], to serve as an extension of its will in the spirit's plan to restore the glory of the Sith Empire. Dovos was still scared of the humanoid spirit, though the being was far too powerful for the former student to defeat. The Sith spirit renamed him \"Warb Null,\" and used its [[Force power/Legends|power]] to fuse the man to his newly-crafted armor. Warb Null became a mindless Sith warrior, remembering little of his previous life. The former metallurgist had been tricked into creating the armor by the Sith spirit, and now he was nothing more than a pawn of the long-dead [[darksider]]. Null later constructed a large, green-bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], with a [[hilt]] several times the length and width of a typical lightsaber hilt, one he wielded with aggressive skill.<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> The Sith spirit taught him many powers, all of which would be necessary in Null's upcoming mission<ref name=\"totjc\" />&mdash;service as the foremost protector to the spirit of the ancient [[King/Legends|king]] of Onderon and Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] of the Sith, [[Freedon Nadd]].<ref name=\"TOTJA\" />\n\n===The Freedon Nadd Uprising===\n{{Main|Freedon Nadd Uprising}}\n{{Quote|As you command, Dark Lord, but I believe that young warrior will give Warb Null a fine beating!''\"<br />\"''Yes.

[[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]], representatives of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], arranged for the relocation of the [[Sith sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of Nadd and Amanoa to a [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|fortress]] on the nearby [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], following a [[Funeral/Legends|funeral]] procession through the streets of Iziz. Null was charged to lead the secret [[Naddist army|army]] of Nadd and Amanoa's [[Marriage/Legends|husband]], former King [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]] of Onderon, in a recovery mission of both sarcophagi.<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> In preparation for the mission, several of the wealthier [[Naddist]]s purchased [[Akin-Dower]] [[Groundborer]]s&mdash;colossal excavation machines&mdash;and fitted them with medium [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], transforming simple [[Mining/Legends|mining]] vehicles into weapons of war. The machines were capable of transporting hundreds of men, with enough space to store the two sarcophagi, making them ideal for the purposes of the darksiders.<ref name=\"totjc\" />\n\nAs the [[Funeral of Amanoa|funeral]] commenced, a pair of exploring [[Beast Riders]], men from the wild lands of Onderon, stumbled upon Null and his [[Army/Legends|army]] of King Ommin in the labyrinth beneath the [[Iziz Royal Palace|royal palace of Iziz]], and the Naddists were forced into action.<ref name=\"TOTJA\" /> The groundborer emerged in the midst of the procession moments later, and the Sith army led by Null disgorged to engage the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and Beast Rider attendees in the ensuing [[First Battle of Onderon (Naddist Uprising)|battle]]. Projecting an intense [[aura of uneasiness]] meant to unsettle his opponents, Null dueled four Jedi&mdash;[[Tott Doneeta]], [[Oss Wilum]], and brothers [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic]] and [[Cay Qel-Droma]]&mdash;simultaneously, while Ommin attacked their [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]], [[Arca Jeth]], through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Ommin's [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], meanwhile, retrieved the sarcophagi and loaded them onto the groundborer. With their mission accomplished, Null disengaged his opponents to join the Naddists in retreat.<ref name=\"FNU1\" />\n\nNull's forces returned to the deep subterranean tunnels beneath the palace with their prize but were pursued shortly afterward by Queen Galia, who had led the Jedi there in search of her [[Parent/Legends|father]]. The spirit of Nadd revealed itself just then as Ommin lashed out to incapacitate Jeth, taking him captive. With their [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] and the sarcophagi in tow, Ommin and Nadd ordered Null to dispatch Ulic Qel-Droma, the remaining Jedi, while they fled to the King's [[Ommin's subterranean fortress|life-support facility]] further beneath the palace.<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> Desperate at the apparent loss of his Master, Qel-Droma lashed out at Null, whom Ommin realized was overmatched and likely to meet his demise. Nadd agreed, as Null had been the Dark Lord's pawn all along, and would serve as a test of the enraged young Jedi's nascent dark side potential. Qel-Droma [[Cho sun/Legends|severed]] Null's weapon [[Limb/Legends|arm]], and the Dark Jedi was forced to beg for mercy. Regardless of Null's pleas, Qel-Droma [[Sai tok/Legends|decapitated]] his opponent with a swift, unsuspecting blow of his lightsaber, thus ending the Dark Jedi's brief time as a Sith.<ref name=\"TOTJA\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nMillennia later, Null's armor and lightsaber would be enshrined in a hexagonal structure in the mountains of [[Nicht Ka]], where they would be discovered by the Jedi [[Ekim Ryelli]], [[Staguu Itincoovar]], and [[Malleus|Telloti Cillmam'n]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]. After donning the armor, Cillmam'n was flooded with visions that made him turn to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. Carried away by his newfound power, he [[Duel on Nicht Ka|killed]] Ryelli and Itincoovar, assuming the identity of Malleus, the [[Hammer of the Dark Side]].<ref name=\"SWI\">{{InsiderCite|147|Hammer (short story)|Hammer}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|For battle come to ''me''!|Warb Null|audio=Warb_Null_1.ogg|Tales of the Jedi (audio)}}\nIn his youth, Shas Dovos was a dedicated metalworking student. He held great importance in his studies and was extremely inquisitive. He was never tempted by the promise of the dark side, yet he was desperate to unlock the secrets withheld in the Sith tome, if only to satisfy his curiosity. However, as the dark side slowly affected him, Dovos became obsessed and no longer cared about anything other than the book. He saw it as his destiny to uncover the book's secrets and to wield its power. He was weak-willed, and the Sith spirit's magic easily gained complete control over him; after several years Dovos had acted exactly as the spirit had wanted him to.<ref name=\"totjc\" />\n\nWarb Null was an extremely loyal warrior after his transformation and did the bidding of his superiors without question. His loyalty, however, meant little to Ommin and the spirit of Freedon Nadd, both of whom simply used Null for their own personal gain. Nor was his death mourned, as his former life had been abandoned long ago, while his dark side superiors felt that he had fulfilled his purpose. Ultimately, Null was expendable to those he served with loyalty.<ref name=\"TOTJA\" /> During the Battle of Onderon in the Freedon Nadd Uprising, Null bravely led the Naddist [[Troop/Legends|troops]] into combat and single-handedly took on four Jedi. Once again, in the rehabilitation facility in Iziz, Null fought numerous foes alone, showing his bravery.<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> He was self-confident and saw Ulic Qel-Droma's powers as insignificant next to his own.

He was an extremely strong man physically, and he used his strength to deal heavy blows to any opponents he faced. Null's skill was such that he was able to hold off multiple opponents, even keeping four Jedi Knights at bay during the ambush of Amanoa's funeral. Null's primary advantage in combat, however, was his Sith armor. Black in color and covered with dozens of sharp spikes, the armor concealed his true appearance. Tempered entirely of alchemically-treated black metal, Null's armor was imbued with Sith magic and possessed at least partial lightsaber-resistance. The forbidding suit enhanced his own malevolent aura and brought despair to his opponents. Despite its benefits, the ungainliness of Null's armor slowed him considerably,<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> nor was it sufficiently protected at his hand and neck, which resulted in his demise.<ref name=\"TOTJA\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWarb Null was created by ''[[Star Wars]]'' writer [[Tom Veitch]] for the [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1|first issue]] of [[Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising|''The Freedon Nadd Uprising'']] sub-series, part of the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series.
