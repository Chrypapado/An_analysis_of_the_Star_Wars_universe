Around [[3956 BBY]], he owned [[Yortal's Emporium]] and was often harassed by the local [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]]. He came to run a used goods shop when he failed at a task for a [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]] executive and was forced to open his shop on [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]] to pay off the debt. Ixlis knew little of Manaan, as he worked all day and slept all night. When the amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] visited his shop, he witnessed a Sith soldier mocking Ixlis.\n\nLater, after Revan [[Raid on the Sith Embassy|raided]] the [[Sith Embassy]] on Manaan and exposed their plot to overthrow the government of that [[Planet/Legends|world]], Ixlis offered Revan a discount on his wares.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDespite him being an Ithorian, the Sith soldier comments to Yortal that \"you fish are a strange breed.\"\n\nIn [[Knights of the Old Republic]], the player can have Revan threaten Yortal when they first meet, resulting in Revan's alignment to the dark side to grow.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Yortal Ixlis\n|pl=Yortal Ixlis\n|ru=\u0419\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0418\u043a\u0441\u043b\u0438\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ixlis, Yortal}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Ithorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manaan residents]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]"}}}]}}}}
