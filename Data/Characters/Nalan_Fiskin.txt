In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Balmorra (Great Galactic Wars)|Battle of Balmorra]], Fiskin ran an election campaign for the new Balmorran government, in which his major opponent was a former [[Balmorran resistance]] member, [[Zenith]]. Fiskin arranged an arrest of Zenith's followers on Balmorra over an operation, which supposedly killed civilians in addition to Imperial soldiers. Zenith hit back by revealing that Fiskin once took a bribe from an Imperial official, after which hundreds of Fiskin's supporters switched over to Zenith. Zenith eventually won the election, becoming the leader of the opposition to [[Tai Cordan]].<ref name=\"SWTOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNalan Fiskin is mentioned in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' during Zenith companion storyline.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fiskin, Nalan}}\n[[Category:Balmorrans]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
