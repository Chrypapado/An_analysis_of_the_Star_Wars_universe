Did you take my daughter?|Nadaa|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Nadaa''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who was a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] living with her daughter, [[Adana (Human)|Adana]], in the [[Refugee Sector]] on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], a [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], during the final days of the [[Dark Wars]] in [[3951 BBY]]. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], her daughter was kidnapped by the [[Exchange]] crime organization overseer of the area, the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] [[Saquesh]], because Nadaa owed the Exchange 600 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. While visiting the moon, the former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Meetra Surik]] spoke with Nadaa and agreed to help free her daughter. Surik met with Saquesh and attempted to intimidate the Quarren into releasing Adana. Surik was unsuccessful and was forced to [[Death/Legends|slay]] Saquesh to free Adana from her [[Prison/Legends|cell]]. Nadaa was extremely grateful and thanked Surik.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|The Overseer&hellip; Saquesh&hellip; he took my daughter to sell to the Hutts. He took my daughter to sell to the Hutts. All because I told him I could not pay his tribute.|Nadaa|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nNear the end of the [[Dark Wars]] in [[3951 BBY]],<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Nadaa was a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] who lived with her daughter, [[Adana (Human)|Adana]], in the [[Refugee Sector]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. At some point during this [[Time/Legends|time]], Adana was kidnapped by the local [[Exchange]] crime boss, a [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] named [[Saquesh]], due to Nadaa's unpaid tribute of 600 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to the Exchange. Saqueesh planned to sell Adana to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] to pay the debt.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nWhile visiting the moon in search of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], spoke with Nadaa. She told Surik that her daughter was being held by the Exchange, and she begged Surik to help her. Surik agreed to help Nadaa rescue Adana, and she went to meet with Saquesh.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> Surik attempted to intimidate Saquesh to release Adana, but Saquesh was not swayed and immediately attacked Surik. The former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knight [[Death/Legends|slew]] the Quarren and his guards and released Adana from her [[Prison/Legends|cell]].<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|127|Saquesh}}</ref> Surik returned to Nadaa, who thanked Surik profusely for her help.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNadaa loved her daughter Adana immensely and was desperate to speak to one of Saqueesh's underlings in hopes of convincing them to release her. Nadaa was exceedingly grateful when Surik was able to return Adana to her.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNadaa appears in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''. She is voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]. The reward for freeing Nadaa's daughter, Adana, is a random [[Armor/Legends|armor]] or weapon upgrade item. The Exile can convince Nadaa to sell herself to Saquesh, which results in [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points. It is also possible for Adana to be sold into [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] if the player tells Saquesh to do it quickly, which also results in dark side points. If this path is followed, the refugee leader [[Hussef]] will later note that Nadaa went mad and vanished.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{CSWECite|III||Saquesh}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nadaa\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]"}}}]}}}}
