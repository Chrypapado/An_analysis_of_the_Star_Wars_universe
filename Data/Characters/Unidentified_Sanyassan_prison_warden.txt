He resided in the [[Terak's Keep|Marauders' Stronghold]] with his fellow castaways and acted as a prison warden for their leader, the self-appointed [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]].\n\nBy [[3 ABY/Legends|3.5 ABY]], the warden was tasked with watching Terak's [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] in the Stronghold's cellblocks, along with a [[Unidentified black-mustachioed Sanyassan|black-bearded colleague]]. As the two Sanyassans were playing cards, the Ewok [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Warrick]] and his companions sneaked into the dungeons and rescued their [[Human/Legends|Human]] friend, the young [[Cindel Towani]].\n\n==Biography==\nAround [[96 BBY]], a group of [[Sanyassan]] [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] known as the [[Sanyassan Marauders|Marauders]] tried to avoid the [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|space law forces]] aboard their stolen [[Starship/Legends|starship]]. Due to the stellar anomalies of the [[Endor system/Legends|Endor system]], the Marauders were stranded on the [[Color/Legends|green]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], and were forced to establish a new Sanyassan civilization there.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> This white-[[Hair/Legends|haired]] individual was one of them.<ref name=\"TBFE\" /> For many decades, the Marauders brought terror to the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]], a peaceful [[Species/Legends|species]] who called Endor home.<ref name=\"ISWU\">''[[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Marauders_card_players.png|thumb|left|The Sanyassans were playing cards when Teek tried to seize the keys]]\nSeveral [[Standard month/Legends|months]] before the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|destruction]] of the [[Death Star II/Legends|second Death Star]], this white-haired Sanyassan was in charge of guarding the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] of [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]], the brutal leader of the Marauders. When the old [[Human/Legends|Human]] hermit [[Noa Briqualon]], the Ewok [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]] and [[Teek]] sneaked into the dungeon to rescue their friend [[Cindel Towani]], the warden was playing cards with [[Unidentified black-mustachioed Sanyassan|a fellow Maurauder]].<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\nThe tiny Teek scurried across the floor to untie the keys from the warden's belt. Then he pulled a card off the table and slipped it up the old Marauder's sleeve. When the elderly warden won the next game, he pounded the table in triumph. The hidden card fell out of his sleeve, and a brawl ensued, as his opponent called him a cheater. Both Sanyassans drew their [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] and fired at the same time, and both passed out and fell on the floor.<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAccording to Towani's rescue team, the card players were two of the meanest-looking, ugliest Marauders they had ever met.<ref name=\"RWC\">''[[The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure]]''</ref> He had a thick, bushy white mustache and a few locks of thinning hair.<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\nLike most Sanyassans,<ref name=\"EndorModdell\">{{GamerCite|9|Endor and the Moddell Sector}}</ref> the warden had a short temper. When the black-bearded Marauder accused him of being a cheater, he was immediately filled with anger. The warden quickly rose up on his feet and drew his blaster, ready to take on his opponent.<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Marauder_Warden_shot.png|thumb|The prison warden sustains a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shot in the chest.]]\nThis elderly Marauder was a minor character in the [[1985]] made-for-TV film ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''. He only appeared in a one-minute scene towards the last third of the movie. It is known that the two card players were portrayed by [[Michael Pritchard]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller Jr.]], but their roles were only credited as \"Card Player #1\" and \"Card Player #2\".<ref name=\"TBFE\" />\n\nThe movie leaves unclear of the Sanyassan died from the blaster shot he sustained. The children's book adaptation ''[[The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure]]'', however, states that he merely \"collapsed on the floor.\" The Sanyassans are known to have tougher hides than [[Human/Legends|Humans]],<ref name=\"EndorModdell\" /> which mean the warden may have resisted the blaster's lethal energetic damage.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Ring, the Witch, and the Crystal: An Ewok Adventure]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Sanyassans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified pirates]]"}}}]}}}}
