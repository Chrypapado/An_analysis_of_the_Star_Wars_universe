And I ''shall'' make it up to you.|Juhani, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Juhani''' was a [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] and a [[Jedi Guardian]] in the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. Juhani grew up on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] after her family escaped the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Battle of Cathar|assault]] on [[Cathar/Legends|Cathar]] prior to the outbreak of the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. In addition to experiencing great hardship and xenophobic discrimination, Juhani was sold into [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]] after the [[Death/Legends|deaths]] of her [[Juhani's father|father]] and [[Juhani's mother|mother]] in order to pay off their debts to the [[Exchange]]. Juhani was eventually freed from her servitude by the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and his [[Revanchist]]s, [[Unidentified Human female Revanchist|one]] of whom encouraged her to become a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. She then made her way to the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] and was accepted for Jedi training by the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Quatra]].\n\nWith his [[Amnesia/Legends|memories replaced]] to turn him against his own [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] followers, Revan began new [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]] at the same time that Juhani was tested by Quatra. Mistakenly believing she had killed her Master in anger, Juhani briefly fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and fled to the [[Ancient Grove]]. Revan was tasked with cleansing the darkness and defeated Juhani in a [[Duel in the Ancient Grove|duel]]; afterwards, he convinced her to seek the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council's]] forgiveness for her actions. Restored as a Jedi, Juhani joined Revan, fellow Jedi [[Bastila Shan]], and their companions in their quest to locate and destroy the [[Star Forge]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Taris was my home for many years. As much as I hated it, it was still home. A rat-hole; a warren; a paradise. I suppose you could call it all these things. For me it was hell&hellip;|Juhani, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nBy [[3973 BBY]],<ref name=\"Birth\" /> Juhani was born to her [[Juhani's father|father]] and [[Juhani's mother|mother]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cathar/Legends|Cathar]], the [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of their [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] [[Species/Legends|species]]. [[Gender/Legends|She]] was only a [[Youngling/Legends|baby]]<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> during the early stages of [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Mandalorian]] aggression that would culminate in the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. The genocide of their people by the forces of [[Mandalore the Ultimate]]'s lead strategist, [[Cassus Fett]],<ref name=\"KotOR 42\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 42|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 42]]</ref> in the [[Battle of Cathar]] forced their people to capitulate to avoid extinction. Her [[Parent/Legends|parents]] fled with her as far as they were able, and eventually settled on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] to raise her.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n[[File:Lowercity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Lower City on Taris]]\nLike many [[Alien/Legends|non-Humans]] on Taris at that point in its history, Juhani's family was relegated to the [[Lower City]] and experienced significant hardships. The native [[Human/Legends|Humans]] disliked them merely for being \"aliens,\" looked at them in disgust, persecuted them, and charged them more than they charged Humans for [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]]. Juhani had mixed feelings for the planet she had to live on; she hated it, called it a \"rat-hole\" and a \"warren,\" but still felt that it was her home. Despite the adversities she faced, she never gave up hope for a better life, in part due to being inspired by tales of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], whom she viewed as the heroes of the Republic.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nIn [[3963 BBY]], the Mandalorians entered Republic space and [[Taris Siege|besieged Taris]].<ref name=\"KotOR Campaign Guide\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> [[Xor]], a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] who had fought with the Mandalorians on Cathar, provoked Juhani's father into a fight and killed him. Her mother escaped with Juhani, but she never fully healed from the [[Death/Legends|death]] of her mate. Although Juhani's mother worked as hard as she could, she did not earn enough [[Currency/Legends|money]] to support both herself and her daughter. She started borrowing money from the [[Exchange]], a crime syndicate that operated on many worlds and was the major supplier of [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] on Taris. Juhani's mother did everything she could to save funds, but due to giving her daughter most of their food, her health deteriorated. One [[Standard day/Legends|day]], she collapsed in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] she worked in; unable to afford a [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]], she never recovered and died.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n[[File:Xor.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Xor, who murdered Juhani's father, later attempted to purchase her from the Exchange.]]\nThe Exchange charged Juhani with her mother's debts, and as she had no way to repay them, they enslaved her. She would later consider it the worst period in her life; she was bound like a beast and treated like livestock.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> Between [[3961 BBY|3961]] and [[3960 BBY]],<ref name=\"The Essential Atlas\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and his [[Revanchist|followers]] arrived to [[Liberation of Taris|liberate]] Taris from the Mandalorians. Before Juhani could be purchased at auction by her father's murderer, she was freed her from her enslavement by Revan; however, the two never directly interacted and she never saw Revan's face. Juhani saw the Jedi in general and Revan in particular as living up to the tales that had inspired her. A [[Unidentified Human female Revanchist|Human woman]] who followed Revan encouraged Juhani to join the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], and the young [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] vowed to become a Jedi.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n===Jedi training===\n====Early years====\n{{Quote|From that moment on I knew that I would have to try to become a Jedi. To lift myself out of the rut I had been living in for years and to make a real difference, as the Jedi were. The foolish delusions of a child. But THIS child made it happen!|Juhani, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nAs soon as Juhani collected enough money, she boarded the first freighter to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], where she was taken for training by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Quatra]] at the [[Jedi Enclave]]. As Juhani progressed through her [[Jedi training/Legends|training]], she struggled with mastering her emotions due to her nature as a Cathar, leading her to question her place among the Jedi.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n[[File:Originalenclave.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Jedi Enclave on Dantooine]]\nThe Human male [[Dak Vesser]] had joined the Order at the same time as Juhani and become her friend. They both had doubts about the Order that they expressed to each other. Believing the Order was too controlling and limiting, Vesser decided to leave and asked Juhani to come with him; he further surprised her by confessing he had romantic feelings towards her that she had been unaware of and did not reciprocate. Vesser, angry at her refusal to follow him, left the Jedi and eventually joined the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] on [[Korriban]].<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nJuhani and [[Belaya]], a Human female and fellow [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], grew especially close to each other during their training. Belaya also struggled with controlling her emotions, something she was often reminded she must learn how to do by her Master, the Twi'lek male [[Zhar Lestin]] who was a member of the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council]]. For several [[Standard year/Legends|years]], the pair were dear companions to each other, and they spent many nights alone together under the stars. Their attachment did not escape the notice of the Council.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n====Falling into darkness====\n{{Quote|Oh, how can the Council ever take me back with what I have done? Striking my Master down in anger is unforgivable!|Juhani, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIn [[3959 BBY]],<ref name=\"KotOR Campaign Guide\" /> Revan returned to Republic space as a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], accompanied by his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]], [[Darth Malak]], and leading a Sith invasion [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]]. Juhani was shocked to learn of the change in her hero and wondered what could be terrible enough to cause a paragon of the Jedi to fall to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Revan was [[Capture of Darth Revan|captured]] by a Jedi strike team<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> in [[3957 BBY]],<ref name=\"KotOR Campaign Guide\" /> and Revan was said to have died; in truth, the greatly injured Revan had been brought to the Council, where the Jedi created a new identity for him through the Force. It was believed that [[Bastila Shan]] could draw on his subconscious memories to lead them to the [[Star Forge]], the seat of power of the former Dark Lord. Meanwhile, Juhani remained with the Jedi and progressed through her training.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nIn [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"KotOR Campaign Guide\" /> Revan's new identity did not yet know the ways of the Force; thus, after the Sith set an ambush for Shan over Taris and eventually destroyed the planet in their attempt to prevent her escape, Shan brought the [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] soldier to Dantooine to train and begin his [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Jedi Trials]]. In the days prior to Revan's third trial, Quatra decided it was time for her pupil to face her own Jedi Trials. Quatra had nothing left to teach Juhani except how to accept her own limitations; thus, she chose to test Juhani in an unorthodox manner by allowing the Cathar to give in to her rage. Juhani struck her Master down in the middle of a fierce confrontation, leaving Quatra greatly injured and feigning death.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n[[File:Juhanimeditates.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Juhani meditates in the Ancient Grove on Dantooine.]]\nBelieving that she had harnessed the power of the dark side and killed her Master, Juhani fled the Enclave and hid in the [[Ancient Grove]], a site that Jedi would visit to [[Meditation/Legends|meditate]]. The grove soon became tainted by Juhani's dark emotions, and the local [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] became more aggressive, resulting in attacks upon the local settlers. Beings at the Enclave passed on rumors regarding the creatures and the conflict that had nearly killed Quatra. The Jedi Council, believing that the closeness and strong emotions between Juhani and Belaya posed a risk of more harm than help, would not permit Belaya to approach her dear companion and attempt to restore her to the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]].<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n====Redemption====\n{{Quote|I am Juhani, and this is my grove. This is the place of my dark power. This is the place you have invaded. When I embraced the dark side, this was where I sought my solace. It is MINE!|Juhani, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:DuelintheAncientGrove.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Revan duels Juhani in the Ancient Grove.]]\nRevan's last test before becoming a Padawan was given to him by Master Zhar Lestin, who told the student that he must confront the source of the darkness tainting the Ancient Grove and stop the threat there without assistance from other Jedi at the academy. Lestin told Revan that the trial would show him how the dark side was a constant danger to all Jedi, and its corruption could take hold even on Dantooine. Revan was not told that he would confront Juhani there.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nAs Revan approached the grove, Juhani sensed his power but did not believe he could match her own. Igniting a [[Color/Legends|red]]-bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], she [[Force Stun|paralyzed]] his companions with the Force and [[Duel in the Ancient Grove|engaged]] him in a duel before he could speak.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> Although she boasted to him about her strength, her bravado masked her grief and shame until Revan defeated her and spared her life.<ref name=\"TOR Revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'' states that Juhani accompanied [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] on the search for the [[Star Forge]] and remained a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] after the end of the [[Jedi Civil War]], thus confirming that the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] outcome of the events involving Juhani in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' are the [[canon]]ical storyline.</ref> Distraught over her actions towards Quatra, she told him to leave her alone, but he persuaded her to ask the Jedi Council for mercy.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nJuhani returned to the Enclave and learned the truth about Quatra, who had been confident that Juhani would pass the trial and had already left to train other students. She felt foolish to have thought she could harm a Master such as Quatra. Though she still bore the emotional impact of her slip to the dark side, she trusted her Master's wisdom and understood what she was meant to learn: humility. Quatra's lesson was that even one who was true to the teachings of the Jedi could fall to the dark side through their inability to understand or accept their own limitations.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n[[File:JuhaniBelayaEnclave.png|thumb|left|280px|Belaya and Juhani were reunited at the Enclave.]]\nWith this final trial passed, Juhani's training with Quatra was complete. Restored as a Jedi, Juhani reunited with Belaya and spent time with her in the courtyard that Belaya frequented.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nWhen Revan and Shan uncovered the [[Star Map]] in the [[Rakatan ruins (Dantooine)|Rakatan ruins]] and were appointed the quest to find the Star Forge, Juhani asked the Council for permission to accompany the Padawan. Juhani was unaware of Revan's true identity, as she had never seen the face behind the mask; nevertheless, the Council felt she may serve as a reminder of the dangers of falling to the dark side, and they granted her request to join the crew of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n===The search for the Star Forge===\n====Befriending her hero====\n{{Quote|Whatever turned Revan must be terrible indeed. I wonder if what we find at the end of our journey will turn us as well... This is meaningless speculation I guess. I just wanted you to know what I held from you.

And my own.|Juhani, to the amnesiac Revan, neither knowing his true identity|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nDuring their travels, Juhani opened up to Revan about her past.<ref name=\"Xor\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]'' states that Juhani crossed paths with [[Xor]], her [[Juhani's father|father's]] [[Death/Legends|killer]], and she was convinced by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] to spare Xor's life after the pair critically injured him, thus confirming that Juhani's personal quest and its [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] outcome are the [[canon]]ical storyline.</ref> When she revealed her homeworld had been Taris, she lashed out at him in anger and blamed him for its destruction, but then calmed herself with the Jedi Code. She realized that nothing could have been done to prevent Taris' destruction. She confessed to her friend that she had been inspired by the Jedi hero who became Darth Revan, neither knowing that she was speaking to the one who had once been that man.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n====Confronting the killer====\nWhile traveling in search of the Star Maps, Juhani encountered Xor, the Twi'lek slaver who had killed her father and tried to purchase her on Taris during the Mandalorian Wars. The slaver tried once again by making an offer to Revan. Revan stood by her, saying she was her own person; Juhani lashed out at Xor as he spoke of how he wiped out her people on Cathar and killed her father on Taris, but she did not give in to her anger. The thought of him still running free made her Cathar blood seethe, but she let him go. Xor promised he would be back.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nThe second time Revan and Juhani encountered Xor, he brought two of his enforcers with him. After Revan and Juhani beat Xor and his thugs, Xor used his last moments attempting to feed her hatred, seeking the satisfaction of showing Juhani she was no better than him by provoking her into killing a defenseless opponent. He related the burning of the people of Cathar in their homes by his hand and the pleasure he took from it. With Revan's support, Juhani was able to leave Xor to his inevitable fate. Juhani regretted that he did not die by her hand, but it was more important that she resisted the dark side.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n====Revelations about Revan====\nWhen the crew was captured by [[Saul Karath]] on his flagship, the [[Leviathan (Interdictor-class cruiser)|''Leviathan'']], Revan learned the real reason for his visions and lost memories as Malak dueled him and taunted him with the revelation. Malak's words were confirmed by Bastila Shan before the Sith Lord captured her. Afterward, Revan revealed the shocking truth of his identity to Juhani and the crew.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nJuhani expressed her strong opinion that Revan, the man who had rescued her from slavery, could never have fully turned to the dark side. She vowed that now&mdash;from his example of redemption&mdash;that she would never fall again.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n====Confronting the Sith====\n{{Quote|You are beneath my contempt, Juhani. When you felt the power of the dark side you fled to a cave like some cowering animal! You know nothing of the Force or its full potential!|A fallen Bastila Shan criticizes Juhani's experience with the dark side|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nWhen Revan had collected the five Star Maps he needed to locate the Star Forge, the ''Ebon Hawk'' approached the [[Space station/Legends|space station]], but the station's disruptor field damaged their [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]]. The ship barely made it to the nearby planet [[Lehon]] without joining the wreckage that covered the surface. Juhani suggested they search the other downed ships for the parts the ''Ebon Hawk'' needed to take off, though the disruptor field still needed to be deactivated. The possible whereabouts of its generator was found by the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[T3-M4]], which detected energy readings on the ship's sensors that seemed to be coming from the [[Temple of the Ancients]]. The [[Elders (Rakatan)|Elders]] granted Revan access to the temple, but tradition had it he should go alone; however, when both Juhani and [[Jolee Bindo]] received a [[Force vision/Legends|premonition]] warning them of great danger laying inside, they insisted on accompanying Revan and struggled to persuade the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] to allow them to. It turned out to be the right decision, as the temple was infested with numerous [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]], [[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Masters]], and [[Sith Acolyte|acolytes]].<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nAtop the Rakatan temple, the Jedi trio was [[Duel on the Temple of the Ancients|confronted]] by Shan, who had been tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak. When she found herself at a disadvantage, the fallen Jedi attempted to lure Revan into reclaiming his usurped title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Although Shan mocked Juhani for running like a \"cowering animal\" when she first touched the dark side, Juhani had grown stronger through her friendship with the man who had once saved her on Taris; his inspiration helped keep her from falling to the dark side again. Juhani and Bindo helped Revan to resist Shan and turn away from his dark side persona for good.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nRevan and his companions proceeded to the Star Forge to [[Battle of Rakata Prime|battle]] the Sith forces and confront Malak. Shan was convinced by Revan to return to the light, and ultimately, Revan was victorious over his former Sith apprentice. Juhani and the rest of the ''Ebon Hawk'' crew survived the battle.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nAfter the death of Malak, the redemption of Bastila Shan, and the destruction of the Star Forge, Juhani was honored at the celebration of the Republic's victory on Lehon along with Revan and his other comrades.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> A [[holostatue]] of Juhani was erected in the [[Leisure Garden]] section of the [[Axial Park]] in the [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], along with the statues of Revan and his other companions in memory of their deeds.<ref name=\"Statues\">{{TORcite|type=faction|Republic|Bonus: Restoring the Statues|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Just let me vent my anger!

Juhani's Master, Quatra, feared that her unchecked perfectionist views would eventually end in frustration and lead Juhani to the dark side. Quatra's final test forced Juhani to re-examine herself and how her pride had nearly made her fall to the dark side; the act would serve as a reminder to Juhani when she needed to reflect on her choices. Juhani claimed that Cathar were solitary and slow to trust by nature. When she eventually joined the Jedi, she mostly kept to herself and had only a small circle of friends, including fellow Padawans Belaya and Dak Vesser. Among Revan and the crew of the ''Ebon Hawk'', she kept herself at a distance, though she valued their companionship. Juhani was often a zealous advocate of the light side and the ways of the Jedi.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nDue to Cassus Fett's unprovoked genocide on her birth planet of Cathar, Juhani held a grudge against Mandalorians, which made it difficult to be civil towards the Mandalorian [[Canderous Ordo]] when they were allied in the quest for the Star Forge. In addition, she harbored some animosity towards Humans for the prejudice and persecution she and her parents suffered while living on Taris. While some of the best people she had ever known were Human, she found it difficult to let go of her bitterness and at times would lash out emotionally at Revan for it. At one point, she blamed Revan and Bastila for the destruction of Taris, although she apologized later for holding them responsible.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|I will be your doom!|Juhani's signature battle cry|audio=JuhaniBattleCry.ogg|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Juhanicamoegf.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Juhani utilizing her Force cloak ability]]\nJuhani's heritage and segregated upbringing had a unique effect on the way her Force powers developed.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> Her particular Cathar subspecies had the ability to quickly alter the pigments in their fur,<ref name=\"CSWE Cathar\" /> a natural camouflage<ref name=\"Jedi vs. Sith\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref> that was enhanced when she instinctively learned how to conceal herself with the power of [[Force cloak|Force camouflage]].

However, their story can only take a more intimate turn if Revan is played as female; Juhani and the male Revan do not express one-sided or reciprocated romantic affections.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nIn the grove, Juhani has additional lines for the female Revan. If told she is a \"beautiful and talented young woman,\" she says Revan seems to know how to affect her. Discussing her belief that she killed Master Quatra, she says, \"I think, in my own way, I truly loved her.\" While thanking Revan for her redemption, Juhani wishes she had a way to make it up to her. Multiple conversations afterward include additional lines from Juhani only when Revan is female. For instance, after the reveal of Revan's identity, Juhani hesitates to share how she feels and calls Revan the woman she has \"come to care for\" if the player has maintained the subplot; otherwise, Revan is the woman Juhani has come to \"admire\" and whose heart she wishes she had.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nThe culmination of the romance with the female Revan depends upon prior choices and occurs when she initiates a conversation with Juhani after refusing to follow Bastila to the dark side in their duel on the Rakatan temple. If the female Revan failed to support Juhani in the past, Juhani will only hint at her unrequited feelings by saying she is glad to have been of value to Revan, even though it was not as much as she would have liked. If Revan continued to ask Juhani about her history and consistently supported her, Juhani will confess her feelings for the other woman. Revan can share that she feels the same way, and Juhani will be pleased, but say they must confront Malak before they can sort out what to do about their mutual emotions for each other.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nUnlike the optional romance subplots between the female Revan and [[Carth Onasi]] or the male Revan and Bastila Shan, Juhani and the female Revan do not use the word \"love.\" Despite Juhani being one of two romantic options for the female Revan,<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> if the player character in the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|sequel]] sets Revan to a light-side female, it will be assumed that Revan had a romantic relationship with Carth Onasi.<ref name=\"KotOR II\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref> However, both the Juhani and Carth Onasi romance subplots are non-canon, as Revan was canonically male and married Bastila Shan after the events at the Star Forge.<ref name=\"The Old Republic: Revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''</ref>\n\n====Other gameplay alternatives====\n{{Quote|Juhani was a&hellip; a dear companion to me for many years. We spent many nights together alone under the stars.|Belaya, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nPlayers have the opportunity to kill Juhani twice. First, after encountering her in the grove, they can choose to end her life instead of redeeming her, thus losing a potential party member. Second, if the player saved Juhani but later chooses to follow Bastila to the dark side, Juhani and Jolee Bindo leave the party and become hostile, resulting in killing them both.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nAfter defeating Xor, the player can persuade Juhani to give in to her emotions and take revenge on him instead of suppressing her anger. If the player does so, Juhani loses control and strikes Xor down with her hatred. Afterwards, Juhani regrets that she gave in to the dark side again, even though she felt he deserved his fate.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n[[File:Belayadarkside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Belaya falls to the dark side if Juhani is killed in the grove.]]\nIf the player chooses killing Juhani instead of redeeming her in the grove, the strength of Belaya's emotions for Juhani causes her to fall to the dark side as well. Upon returning to the enclave, Belaya initiates a confrontation, expressing her anger towards the player and the Jedi Council for their roles in Juhani's death. She believes a more experienced Jedi or one who believed in Juhani could have spared and saved her, but the Council would not let Belaya try. Thanks to the player, she will never again spend nights under the stars with her dear companion as they did so many times before. Inconsolable, Belaya leaves the Jedi Order and falls to the dark side. When Revan arrives at the Sith Academy to search for the Star Map, Belaya is there as a student. She again blames Revan for Juhani's death, saying it placed a \"bitter blackness in my heart,\" and swears vengeance for Juhani. She attacks and is killed by the former Sith Lord.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n===Bugs and rumors===\nAlthough Juhani's romance subplot is intended for only female player characters,<ref name=\"Script note 1\">An early conversation between the player character and Juhani in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' activates a script (k_hjuh_p17) that checks the player character's [[Gender/Legends|gender]].
