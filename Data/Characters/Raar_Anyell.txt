Anyell witnessed the shuttle destroyed by his commander after the pilot refused to return. He was one of two pilots assigned to examine the wreckage for survivors, of which there were none.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Death Star (novel)|''Death Star'']] {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Raar Anyell\n|ja=\u30e9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30a2\u30cb\u30a8\u30eb\n|fi=Raar Anyell\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anyell, Raar}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy pilots of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
