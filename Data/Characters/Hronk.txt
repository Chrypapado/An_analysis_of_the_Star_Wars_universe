Whether that fiery-tempered furball appreciates it or not your two families will be at ''peace''.|Han Solo, to Chewbacca, on Hronk|Way of the Wookiee!}}\n'''Hronk''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. A member of the same clan as the [[albino]] Wookiee [[Tojjevvuk]], who had been [[Death/Legends|killed]] by a Wookiee named [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], Hronk was determined to uphold a [[Blood/Legends|blood]] feud declared against Chewbacca by Tojjevvuk's [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[Tvrrdko]]. At one point, Hronk nearly defeated Chewbacca in combat, but their fight was broken up by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces, a new threat that prompted both combatants to escape from Kashyyyk. Tvrrdko eventually called off the blood feud, but Hronk was still determined to kill Chewbacca. Between [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]] and [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Hronk was captured by the Empire on the planet [[Formos/Legends|Formos]] and was due to be [[Transport/Legends|transported]] to the [[Spice Mines of Kessel]].\n\nHowever, Chewbacca was also present on the planet at the [[Time/Legends|time]] with his [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] partner, the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. Chewbacca rescued Hronk from an [[Quirt's prison ship|Imperial prison ship]] against Hronk's will and brought him to his and Solo's [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. Although the ''Falcon'' was detained by the [[Imperial prison barge|prison ship]], Chewbacca and Solo managed to slip Hronk out under the nose of its commanding [[Officer/Legends|officer]], [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Quirt]], by disguising Hronk as Chewbacca. Once they were out of danger, Chewbacca, instead of fighting Hronk, flew him to the nearest safe port, from which Hronk could find passage to Kashyyyk. According to the [[way of the Wookiee]], Hronk's life had been saved by Chewbacca, so he had to forgive his rival.\n\n==Biography==\n===The blood feud===\n{{Quote|Back then, that prisoner of the stormtroopers and you were ''rivals''&hellip;growing out of a long standing ''feud'' between families.

Hronk gained the upper hand, but their fight was interrupted by the appearance of an Imperial work force impressment crew. To avoid a [[Standard year/Legends|year's]] service with an Imperial defoliation project, both Hronk and Chewbacca escaped from the planet.<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee\" />\n\nIn 5 BBY, Chewbacca came back to Kashyyyk and rescued a number of Wookiee [[Youngling/Legends|children]] from [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Slavery/Legends|slavers]]. His selfless actions prompted Tvrrdko to call off the blood feud several years later; however, Hronk refused to acknowledge the resolution of the conflict and remained intent on killing Chewbacca.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> At some point between [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]] and [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]],<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee date\">The events of ''[[Way of the Wookiee!]]'' are alluded to in the novel ''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' during [[Han Solo]]'s last [[Kessel Run/Legends|Kessel Run]], which ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' dates to [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. ''The New Essential Chronology'' also dates Solo's acquisition of the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], which is featured in the comic strip, to [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]]. ''Way of the Wookiee'' is therefore set between those two dates.</ref> Hronk was captured by the Empire on the planet [[Formos/Legends|Formos]] and was scheduled to be [[Transport/Legends|transported]] by an [[Quirt's prison ship|Imperial prison ship]] to the [[Spice Mines of Kessel|spice mines]] of the nearby planet [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]]. While he was being escorted through the streets of Formos by a [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], Hronk passed near Chewbacca, who had become a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] and was present on Formos along with his [[Human/Legends|Human]] partner, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], on a smuggling errand for [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. As the [[Way of the Wookiee|Wookiee way]] dictated that the two rivals had to settle their dispute between themselves, Chewbacca attempted to attack the stormtroopers and rescue Hronk, forcing Solo to pacify his first mate with a shot in the back from a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] set on [[Stun/Legends|stun]]. Hronk was then transported to the [[Imperial prison barge|prison ship]] [[Captain/Legends|captained]] by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Quirt]], and the Imperials took a sample of Hronk's [[Heart/Legends|heart]] and respiratory patterns.<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee\" />\n\n===Rescued by the enemy===\n{{Quote|Quit ''grumbling'', Hronk! Whatever your feud is with Chewbacca, you'll get a ''fighting chance''&hellip;more than you'd find in the spice mines of Kessel!

Lucky they did specific scans so ''Chewie'' was never detected&mdash;and lucky that to that Imperial idiot, all Wookiees really ''do'' look alike!|Han Solo|Way of the Wookiee!}}\nShortly afterward, while docked in the planet's [[Formos Spaceport|spaceport]], the [[Prison/Legends|prison]] [[Starship/Legends|ship]] holding Hronk was infiltrated by Chewbacca, who opened its detention hold, releasing all [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] and starting a riot. With the Imperials preoccupied with fighting the prisoners, Chewbacca went for Hronk. The latter, however, refused to be rescued by his enemy, forcing Chewbacca to stun him. Chewbacca carried the unconscious Hronk to his and Solo's ship, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], arriving just as Solo had finished loading a shipment of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] from their contact, a [[Alien/Legends|non-Human]] named [[N'Mrith]]. Chewbacca then hid Hronk in one of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} secret smuggling compartments before quickly lifting off from the planet. However, Solo and Chewbacca had been sold out to Quirt by N'Mrith, who told the Colonel about their cargo of spice; an Imperial battle [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]] was waiting for them in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]]. While the cruiser kept the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[Sensor/Legends|sensors]] busy, Quirt's prison ship gained on the smuggler ship and activated a [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]] to tow the ''Falcon'' into its [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]].<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee\" />\n\n[[File:Hronkbacca.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hronk posing as Chewbacca aboard Quirt's ship]]\nAs they were pulled aboard, Chewbacca quickly came up with a plan to hide their new passenger, who had just come to his senses. He had Hronk cover the [[Color/Legends|white]] streak in his fur with grease so that he looked indistinguishable from Chewbacca to Quirt and his men, who could not tell Wookiees apart. Unwilling to be recaptured, Hronk cooperated, while Chewbacca himself hid in a secret compartment. When the Falcon was brought aboard the Imperial ship, Hronk impersonated Chewbacca, exiting the Falcon and standing beside Solo as the Imperials [[Scanner|scanned]] the ship for spice. They did not find any contraband aboard, as Chewbacca, unbeknownst to Solo, had dumped their cargo when they had lifted off from Formos.<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee\" />\n\nSeeing that Solo's copilot was a Wookiee, Quirt suspected that Solo might also be transporting the missing Wookiee prisoner. Quirt's men scanned the ''Falcon'' for Hronk's presence using his specific heart and respiratory patterns. Once again, the scanners did not detect anything, as Hronk was standing beside Quirt, outside of their range. Quirt then had no option but to let Solo go. The Human offered to take Chewbacca and Hronk to some place where they could settle their feud in battle, but Chewbacca thought otherwise and instead asked Solo to take them to the nearest safe port, from which Hronk could find a transport to Kashyyyk; Solo did so. By breaking him out of the prison ship, Chewbacca had saved Hronk's life and, by Wookiee customs, wiped out the original grounds for the feud. Although he still felt uneasy at being indebted for his rescue to his former rival, Hronk left the two smugglers in peace<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee\" /> and forgave Chewbacca.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What ''now'', first mate&hellip;?

Aside from a white streak amidst his otherwise brown hair, Hronk looked very similar to Chewbacca, which allowed him to trick Quirt by impersonating his rival.<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee\" /> Even after the blood feud was called off by Tvvrdko, Hronk still clung to the old ways and wanted to fight and kill Chewbacca.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> When Chewbacca came to rescue him from the prison ship, Hronk refused to go with him, prompting Chewbacca to stun him.

Overall, Solo found Hronk fiery-tempered and grouchy.<ref name=\"Way of the Wookiee\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHronk first appeared in the short [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] strip ''[[Way of the Wookiee!]]'', the first part of a three-part story published in [[Star Wars Weekly 94|''Star Wars Weekly'' 94]] on [[December 12]], [[1979]].
