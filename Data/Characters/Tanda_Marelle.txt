If she hadn't lost her entire homeworld, I imagine she'd still be happily ransacking safes.|Airen Cracken|Cracken's Rebel Operatives}}\n'''Tanda Marelle''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] senior reporter who worked for the [[Galaxywide NewsNets|NewsNet]] ''[[Galactic Resorts]]'' shortly before the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] and during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. She was also a master art and jewel thief, called the \"'''Tombat'''\" and believed to be [[Gender/Legends|male]] by the galactic media. Despite her unsavory alternate profession, she was an important informant for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name=\"CRO\" /> Among other things, Tombat stole a pair of six thousand years old [[Manderon Period|Manderon]] [[Slugthrower/Legends|slugthrowers]] from [[Fitz Roi]] and the [[Corusca gem/Legends|corusca gem]] necklace of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Landric]]'s wife.\n\n==Biography==\nTanda Marelle was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] born on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]<ref name=\"CRO\" /> before the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].<ref name=\"HNN52\">{{Hnn|52|news/13418_4.html|Greyshade Proposes Gambling as Revenue|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728123342/http://www.holonetnews.com/52/news/13418_4.html}}</ref> A member of a prominent [[Merchant/Legends|trading]] family, she became bored with her life and sought adventure and excitement. Even Marelle became a [[Journalist/Legends|journalist]], working for the ''[[Galactic Resorts]]'' [[holomagazine]]. Traveling the resort worlds of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], Marelle used her position to aid in her other career choice; a jewel thief. On assignment, she would use her cover to case targets and individuals.<ref name=\"CRO\" /> In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], just prior to the Clone Wars, Marelle was a senior correspondent with ''Galactic Resorts'', and contributed several opinions regarding the state of the galactic economy and tourism spending while the galaxy appeared to be gearing up for war.<ref name=\"HNN52\" />\n\nAs a jewel thief, Marelle established an alias for herself, the Tombat. Early in her career as a thief, an incident caused people to believe that the Tombat was male. Marelle did nothing to correct the mistake, and actively encouraged the misconception as it amused her. She found the ruse useful for evading capture and suspicion as authorities were always searching for a man. The Tombat became an infamous figure in the galaxy, known as a superb jewel thief who was invisible and could bypass any defense or security system and take whatever he wanted without a trace. Stories told of his prowess with woman, and his ability to captivate females.<ref name=\"CRO\" /> The Tombat always left behind a single [[quella stone]] in place of the items stolen as a signature.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|III|252|\"Tombat\"}}</ref> By the early part of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], arrest warrants were issued in 30 [[Star system/Legends|star systems]] for the Tombat.<ref name=\"CRO\" /> At some point, Tombat was rumored to have broken into [[Noval Garaint]]'s base in the [[Kheedar system]] and discovered that the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] had rebuilt and reprogrammed the chassis of a half dozen [[F1 exploration droid]]s to serve as bodyguard units.<ref name=\"CFT-D\">''[[Cynabar's Fantastic Technology: Droids]]''</ref>\n\nAlthough Marelle was not concerned with any cause apart from her own, that changed in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] with the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Shaken by the destruction&mdash;mainly due to amount of gems she had stashed away on the planet&mdash;Marelle sought out the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] to offer her services. She tracked Alliance [[General/Legends|General]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]] down to a safehouse on [[Albecus]], and brought with her a packet of love letters that Cracken had written at the age of sixteen and lost long ago. Her display convinced Cracken that she would be a remarkable asset, although he lamented the fact that her commitment to the Alliance was sporadic at best.<ref name=\"CRO\" />\n\nDespite being Alderaanian, Marelle did not get along with her fellow exiles due to her reputation as a thief. During a briefing, Alliance agent [[Winter Celchu|Targeter]] angrily confronted Marelle for wearing a pendant that Targeter insisted belonged to the Alderaanian Royal Family. The pendant was later seen in the possession of [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].<ref name=\"CRO\" />\n\nIn [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Marelle reported on the preparations for the [[2,367th annual Priole Danna Festival]] on [[Lamuir IV]].<ref name=\"GNN3\">{{Journal|3|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> During the festival, Marelle stole a pair of antique [[Slugthrower/Legends|slugthrowers]] created by [[Andel Tanner]] during the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] [[Manderon Period]] which belonged to the [[Jatz/Legends|Jatz]] singer [[Fitz Roi]]. Lifting them from the safe in the singer's [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]] room, Marelle left leaving behind a blue quella stone in the weapon's leather holding case.<ref name=\"GNN4\">{{Journal|4|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> Several [[Standard month/Legends|months]] later, Marelle was on [[Spira/Legends|Spira]], reporting on the annual [[Spira Regatta Open]].<ref name=\"GNN5\">{{Journal|5|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> She pulled the [[Spira Heist]] during the Regatta.<ref name=\"GNN6\">{{Journal|6|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Marelle was on [[Tinnel IV/Legends|Tinnel IV]] when she raided the personal estate of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Tiaan Jerjerrod/Legends|Tiaan Jerjerrod]], ruler of the [[Quanta sector]]. She stole several works of art from the Moff's vaults, but left data disks in place.<ref name=\"GNN6\" /> A few [[Standard month/Legends|months]] later, Marelle was on [[Elshandruu Pica]], where she stole gems and setting valued at over six million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Landric (Lady)|Landric]] of [[Danteel]] who was staying at [[Margath's on Elshandruu Pica]]. Lady Landric, wife of Moff [[Landric]] announced that a full scale investigation into the theft was to be launched. Two [[Standard day/Legends|days]] later, Marelle returned the gems and settings to the safe where she had looted them from, baffling investigators. Despite this, the [[Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations/Legends|Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations]] assigned [[Special Enforcement Officer/Legends|Special Enforcement Officer]] [[Zanza Gata]] to the Tombat case.<ref name=\"GNN8\">{{Journal|8|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], Maralle reported on the release of Fitz Roi's newest [[sound slug]], ''[[Tymin' Downband]]'' while on [[Arcopola]]. A month later, she looted the art collection of [[Whiphid/Legends|Whiphid]] business tycoon [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Galrowk]] on [[Gambolla]].<ref name=\"GNN11\">{{Journal|11|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> A few months later, Marelle was on [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] reporting on the lavish production of [[The Kallea Cycle]]. During a banquet hosted by [[House Brentioch]], Marelle arranged for quella stones to be baked into the bowls of [[shim-bay crispa]] served to the guests, which included [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Jamson Caglio]], [[Imperial Advisor]] [[Alec Pradeux]], and [[Inspector/Legends|Inspector]] [[Zanza Gata]] of the IOCI.<ref name=\"GNN13\">{{Journal|13|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMarelle was trained to use a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], and carried a [[palm blaster]]. She was also trained in [[Unarmed combat|unarmed]] and [[Melee weapon/Legends|melee combat]]. Marelle was knowledgeable about [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucratic]] procedure, [[Alien/Legends|alien]] cultures, and law enforcement. She could fly [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] vehicles and [[Swoop/Legends|swoops]], and could operate security equipment. Marelle was able to program and repair [[Computer/Legends|computers]], and program [[Droid/Legends|droids]], and was skilled in demolitions and first aid treatment. An able thief, she was also able to con or persuade targets, was adept at sneaking and hiding, skilled in the art of forgery, and was a [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]]. Marelle carried a [[doorjacker]] with her.<ref name=\"CRO\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMarelle's profile in ''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]'' lists her age as 28, and is written from an in-universe perspective set just after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], indicating a birthdate of [[28 BBY/Legends|28 BBY]]. However, [[HoloNet News (original website)|HoloNet News]] articles set in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]] list her as a senior reporter despite the fact that she would be only 6 years old. This article assumes that the age given in ''Cracken's Rebel Operatives'' is incorrect, and had been superseded by more current sources.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Hnn|52|news/13418_4.html|Greyshade Proposes Gambling as Revenue|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728123342/http://www.holonetnews.com/52/news/13418_4.html}}\n*{{Hnn|52|business/13418_1.html|Leisure Industry Suffers Record Losses|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728115106/http://www.holonetnews.com/52/business/13418_1.html}}\n*{{Journal|3|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|4|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{ID|Tombat}}\n*{{Journal|5|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*{{Journal|6|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{ID|Tombat}}\n*{{Journal|8|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{ID|Tombat}}\n*{{Journal|11|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*{{Journal|13|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*{{Journal|14|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{ID|Tombat}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Cynabar's Fantastic Technology: Droids]]'' {{ID|Tombat}} <!--P90-->\n*{{Journal|14|Cynabar's Droid Datalog (article series)|Cynabar's Droid Datalog}} {{C|As \"Tombat\"}}\n*''[[The Far Orbit Project]]'' {{ID|Tombat}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{ID|Tombat}}\n*{{DB|character|moffjerjerrod|Jerjerrod, Moff|archivedate=20110130045222}} {{ID|Tombat}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tanda Marelle\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marelle, Tanda}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Journalists]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
