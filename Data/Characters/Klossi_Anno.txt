A [[Jedi Commander/Legends|commander]] within the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]], she survived the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] and the execution of [[Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150|Contingency]] [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], unlike her master, who [[Death/Legends|died]] during the initial stages of the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]].\n\n==Biography==\nDiscovered to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] near birth on [[Chalacta/Legends|Chalacta]], Klossi Anno was taken to the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]] and inducted into the [[Jedi academy|academy]] there. Studying the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Anno eventually [[Jedi Initiate Trials|graduated]] after years of study and was selected by a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] for one-on-one training. During her apprenticeship, the tensions between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] came to a breaking point resulting in the start of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Reporting to the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]], Anno was given the rank of [[Jedi Commander/Legends|Commander]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] and leadership of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]].<ref name=\"DL\" />\n\nAfter years of fighting, the war ended abruptly when the Republic's [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] disbanded the Jedi Order with the issuance of [[Contingency Orders for the Grand Army of the Republic: Order Initiation, Orders 1 Through 150|Contingency]] [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]]. When her clone troopers turned their [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] on her, Anno's master sacrificed herself so that Anno could flee. Making her way to [[Dellalt/Legends|Dellalt]], Anno joined with nine other fugitive Jedi in hijacking an [[SX troop transport|SX troop shuttle]] from the newly formed [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. While they were pursued by a group of [[Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter/Legends|ARC-170s]] and a light cruiser, losing two of their company, Anno and the others escaped pursuit and were given sanctuary by the crew of the ''[[Drunk Dancer]]''. In the company of [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Jula Shryne]], the group was eventually joined by Master [[Roan Shryne]] and Padawan [[Olee Starstone]]. Given new hope by Starstone's enthusiasm and determination, Anno and her companions agreed to search for [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. Giving Master Shryne her fallen master's lightsaber, the group headed out to meet their fate on the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] homeworld.<ref name=\"DL\" />\n\nOnce there, Kashyyyk came under [[Battle of Kashyyyk (19 BBY)|invasion]] by the Empire for housing Jedi. Led by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], the Empire searched for the Jedi fugitives, eventually confronting them. Padawan Anno attacked the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] after he injured [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] [[Siadem Forte]] and [[Iwo Kulka]], but the powerful [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] merely sidestepped her, slashing her across the back with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. Dragged away from the battle and taken offworld by the other surviving Jedi, Anno was able to recover and decided to sabotage the Empire in a less direct way. With the suggestions of her comrades, Anno planned to work on construction sites, or in an agricultural project, and intended to undo the Sith in more subtle ways than with a lightsaber.<ref name=\"DL\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Klossi Anno\n|fr=Klossi Anno\n|pt=Klossi Anno\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anno, Klossi}}\n[[Category:Chalactans]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jedi Commanders]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]"}}}]}}}}
