Screeger tended to stop in the middle of sentences to think about what he would say next, usually in the form of \"whaddya call it.\"\n\n==History==\n{{Quote|Unbelievable. ''You're'' Vedo's gatekeeper?|[[Cade Skywalker]]|Legacy (2006) 49}}\nHe was a patron of [[Rik's Cantina/Legends|Rik's Cantina]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], although he hopped many seedy places such as [[Brogar]]'s Cantina on [[Lok/Legends|Lok]], where he ran into [[Cade Skywalker]], who sought to collect Screeger's bounty posted by [[Rav]]. With little effort, the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] captured Screeger, who pleaded to be released up until he was turned over to [[Rav]] on [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]].\n\n[[File:Naxy.jpg|thumb|left|Naxy turned over to [[Rav]].]]\nScreeger soon helped Cade, Syn, [[Chak (Wookiee)|Chak]] and Kee get into the [[Golden Gorg Cantina]]. After the latter got the ''[[Grinning Liar]]'' back, Screeger tried to beg Cade to let him on the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']] before Rav killed him. To keep him from creating trouble, Skywalker placed him in the hold where there were rotting [[Gorg/Legends|gorgs]] until they could drop him off somewhere.\n\nSome time after the death of [[Darth Krayt]], Screeger became an [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] for [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] [[Vigo/Legends|Vigo]] [[Lun Rask]], however was undercover as an operative for Cade so that the ''Mynock'' could intercept their ships while they were hijacking Imperial freighters and could take the goods for themselves.<ref name=\"Legacy37\">[[Legacy (2006) 37|''Legacy'' (2006) 37]]</ref>\n\nHe later got a job as gatekeeper in the [[Vedo Anjiliac Atirue's headquarters|headquarters]] of [[Vedo Anjiliac Atirue]], the leader of [[Anjiliac]] [[Kajidic/Legends|kajidic]]. Skywalker, who was requested by Vedo and [[Jool]], Screeger reminded Skywalker that he owed him for telling him that Sith scientist [[Vul Isen]], whom Skywalker was hunting, was on [[Daluuj/Legends|Daluuj]]. However, only one of Isen's former labs was there, and Skywalker refused to pay him as Isen himself wasn't present before moving in to see Vedo, reminding him that they were invited. Screeger wasn't bothered, and decided to let Skywalker pass, before correcting that only ''he'' was invited and causing a door to fall from the ceiling, cutting off Cade from his companions and disappearing into the ground. Several [[Security droid/Legends|security droids]] then attacked him, as Vedo wanted to test his skills, but he easily dispatched them with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Legacy (2006) 2|''Legacy'' (2006) 2]] {{1st}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 3|''Legacy'' (2006) 3]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 37|''Legacy'' (2006) 37]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 48|''Legacy'' (2006) 48]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Naxy Screeger\n|es=Naxy Screeger\n|pl=Naxy Screeger\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Screeger, Naxy}}\n[[Category:Black Sun members]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sakiyans]]"}}}]}}}}
