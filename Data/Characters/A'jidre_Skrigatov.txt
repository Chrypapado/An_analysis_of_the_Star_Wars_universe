To avoid a public frenzy, he arranged to be wed to the granddaughter of the previous governor, [[Brinaloy N'Vaari]].\n\nA local [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] gangster named [[Malkoi]] shared a mutual vendetta with Skrigatov and as such, arranged for N'Vaari to be kidnapped. Malkoi hoped to blackmail Skrigatov out of power and install a puppet governor.\n\nThey were both foiled when N'Vaari used her comprehensive training as an actress to impersonate a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] performer at the [[Starlight Theater]] located on [[Phyrstal Island]] in the resort city of [[Le Yer]].\n\nAfter Skrigatov's failure, he and his good friend [[Friizt]], the owner of the [[Triple Nova Casino]] in Le Yer, struggled to get him re-elected.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=No Disintegrations (West End Games)|text=''No Disintegrations''|story=Abregado-Rae Intrigue}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skrigatov, A'jindre}}\n[[Category:Abregado-rae]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Devaronians]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
