He held the rank-position of Reactor Tech 4.\n\nAs the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], especially [[Jorus C'baoth]], took increasing control over all aspects of the ship, Uliar's resentment of the Jedi grew.\n\nHe survived the crash of ''[[Outbound Flight]]'' onto [[The Redoubt/Legends|the Redoubt]]. Even moments after the crash, he began to suspect [[Dillian Pressor]] of being a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]]. Later on, he became a [[Director/Legends|Director]] of the colony, and due to his distaste of the Jedi, anyone he suspected of being Force-sensitive were first quarantined, then banished to ''[[Dreadnaught-Three]]'' if Force-sensitivity was confirmed. Uliar often rightly suspected Dillian's granddaughter [[Evlyn Tabory|Evlyn]] of being a Force-sensitive, but her mother [[Rosemari Pressor Tabory|Rosemari]] and her uncle [[Jorad Pressor|Jorad]] covered for her to prevent Uliar from sending her to D-Three.\n\nWhen the colonists of the wrecked ''Outbound Flight'' were relocated to the [[Empire of the Hand]] after the [[Battle of the Redoubt]], Uliar was one of the few who needed the most persuasion to go.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']]\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Chas Uliar#legends\n|hu=Chas Uliar\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Uliar, Chas}}\n[[Category:Empire of the Hand citizens]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Judicial Department personnel]]\n[[Category:Legislators and councilors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight Peacekeepers]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight residents]]"}}}]}}}}
