Everyone on Nar Shaddaa answers to Krayn.|[[Gogol (patron)|Gogol]] to Obi-Wan Kenobi at [[Splendor Tavern|the Dor]].|Jedi Quest: Path to Truth}}\n'''Aga Culpa''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] who ruled the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] during the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] leading up to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. He was a puppet-ruler for [[Hutt/Legends|the Hutts]], crime-lords who owned the factories; his job was to keep the Hutts rich. They, doubtless, cared little about the methods he used to achieve his quotas, as long as they were met: whether Culpa, or [[Krayn]]\u2015a slave-[[Pirate/Legends|raider]] and the moon's true power-holder\u2015claimed responsibility for that success was immaterial.\n\nIn [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], Culpa allowed the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] to incite a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] revolt against Krayn, who had forced Culpa into allowing him the use of Nar Shaddaa's [[Spice/Legends|spice]]-processing facilities: Krayn had promised freedom for Culpa's native people if he would concede to the crime-lord's control of the moon's spice factories.\n\nUltimately, Culpa served Krayn (just as he did the Hutts) as a puppet-leader to the citizens of the \"Smuggler's Moon.\" His weak, subservient mind was susceptible even to [[Mind trick/Legends|Jedi mind tricks]], as it was through this means that Tachi and Skywalker were able to \"persuade\" Culpa into ordering his guards to 'look the other way' when Krayn's slaves rebelled in mass revolt against their continued servitude in Nar Shaddaa's spice-processing factories.\n\nAs it turned out, it was the slaves themselves who finally won true freedom for all of Culpa's [[Satellite/Legends|satellite]] citizens.\n\nA thin creature, Culpa's skin was pale gray and he possessed a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] [[Brain/Legends|brain]] implant.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Jedi Quest 3|''Jedi Quest'' 3]]\n*[[Jedi Quest 4|''Jedi Quest'' 4]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Aga Culpa\n|nl=Aga Culpa\n|pl=Aga Culpa\n|ru=\u0410\u0433\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043f\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culpa, Aga}}\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Near-Humans]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
