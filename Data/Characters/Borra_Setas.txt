I guess at this point, if I'm dead, I'm dead. Fine. I discovered that a major crime figure here is putting political pressure on someone in Mos Eisley. I won't say more than that though.|Borra Setas|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Borra Setas resided in the [[City/Legends|town]] of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> she discovered information concerning a plot involving [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]]. The plot was to incite the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] to attack [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] in order to pressurize the [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] and eventually take control of the city.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" />\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nDuring this time, a female [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[entertainer]] named [[Anetia Kah'ryn]] tasked a novice entertainer with gathering information from [[Crix Yarrow]], [[Dorn Gestros]], and Borra Setas concerning criminal and Tusken activity in Mos Eisley. When the entertainer traveled to Anchorhead and approached Borra Setas, she said it would probably be best not to talk to her. The entertainer asked why, and mentioned that Borra looked sad. Borra then lashed back that she was not sad, but rather scared due to the position she was in. When the entertainer said it could not be that bad, Borra yelled that the entertainer was not the one who upset a major crime boss, later revealed to be Jabba the Hutt. The entertainer asked Borra for more information, at which point she grew dismayed at saying too much already. Feel as though her life was already at stake, she decided to may as well divulge more information. She informed the spacer that she discovered a major crime figure was putting political pressure on someone in Mos Eisley. However, she refused to reveal anymore information. Afterwards, the entertainer returned to Anetia Kah'ryn to bring back this information, and await further instructions.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:TemplateCommonerRodianFemale.jpg|250px|thumb|Every possible depiction of Borra Setas]]\nBorra Setas was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and publisShed by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Borra Setas was added to the game with the release of the with the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 17 Notes for 26 May 2005|Publish 17]]\", on [[May 26]], [[2005]].<ref name=\"SWG:2005\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref> She was part of a quest given by Anetia Kah'ryn to beginner players who had chosen a career of \"[[W:c:swg:Entertainer (pre-NGE)|entertainer]]\".<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> During each server reset, her appearance was randomized, but she consistently appeared as a Rodian female.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Anetia Kah'ryn's quest was removed from the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]],<ref name=\"SWG:2005\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Total Experience}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Borra Setas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Setas, Borra}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
