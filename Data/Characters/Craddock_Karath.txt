He was stationed at the Republic [[Foerost Shipyards|shipyards]] near the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Foerost/Legends|Foerost]] when the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] and [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Mandalorian Crusaders|forces]] arrived and [[Battle of Foerost (Great Sith War)|took them over]], and was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during the battle. His son Saul had a grudge against Captain [[Dace Golliard]] ever since, because the captain had fled the battle, which resulted in the slaughter of Craddock and the other worker by the Krath and Mandalorians.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 49|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 49]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.farawaypress.com/comics/swknights/swkotor49.html John Jackson Miller's notes for issue #49]\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Craddock Karath\n|ru=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0434\u043e\u043a \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karath, Craddock}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy officers]]"}}}]}}}}
