What are you doing here smokey?|Kivvaaa, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees}}\n'''Kivvaaa''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who lived during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] as the patrol leader for the [[Myyydril]], a tribe that lived in the [[Myyydril Caverns]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Kivvaaa was stationed at the entrance of the caverns when she encountered a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] passing through the area. Like many of the Myyydril, Kivvaaa was suspicious of outsiders, but, after the spacer spoke with her, the being quickly gained her trust. The spacer wished to assist the Myyydril with the [[Urnsor'is]] [[Spider/Legends|spider]] infestation that had long plagued the tribe, and Kivvaaa directed the being to the Myyydril's [[Chief/Legends|chief]], [[Kallaarac]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|The Urnsor'is&hellip;they've been destroying our village, the cavern itself, for many years. Many have died&hellip;many young Myyydril.|Kivvaaa|Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees}}\nKivvaaa was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] and a member of the [[Myyydril]]&mdash;a secluded multi-[[Species/Legends|species]] tribe that resided in the [[Myyydril Caverns]] in the [[Kkowir Forest]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]&mdash;during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Kivvaaa served as the tribe's patrol leader, tasked with guarding the entrance of the caverns from outsiders. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], the Myyydril were being harassed by [[Urnsor'is]] [[Spider/Legends|spiders]] that had infested the caverns, [[Death/Legends|killing]] many Myyydril, especially the youth of the tribe. Kivvaaa lost her entire [[Limb/Legends|right arm]] when it was infected with the flesh-eating [[Poltur Virus]] in one of these Urnsor'is attacks. She replaced the lost limb with a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] one.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nShortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Kivvaaa was stationed at the entrance to the Myyydril Caverns when she encountered a wandering [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] attempting to enter. Like many of the Myyydril, Kivvaaa was highly suspicious of outsiders, and at first did not permit the being from entering the caverns, demanding to know why the traveler wanted to pass. However, the spacer&mdash;able to understand Kivvaaa's [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]] [[Language/Legends|language]]&mdash;only wished to explore the area.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nFeeling embarrassed for her original rudeness, Kivvaaa apologized and explained that the caverns were extremely dangerous due to the Urnsor'is infestation and that she did not want the spacer to pass just to be killed by the spiders. The spacer offered to assist the Myyydril with ending the Urnsor'is menace, and Kivvaaa&mdash;now trusting the being for the traveler's kindness&mdash;allowed the spacer to enter the caverns and directed the spacer to the Myyydril [[Chief/Legends|chief]], [[Kallaarac]]. The spacer was eventually able to gain Kallaarac and the rest of the tribe's trust and successfully managed to destroy the Urnsor'is infestation.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|You understand us. I find that odd, but welcoming nonetheless.|Kivvaaa, regarding the spacer understanding Shyriiwook|Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees}}\nLike most of the Myyyndril, Kivvaaa was suspicious of strangers, which she showed when she initially prevented the spacer from going into the caverns. However, the being quickly gained her trust by being able to understand the Wookiee language of Shyriiwook&mdash;a rarity among outsiders&mdash;and showing sympathy for the Myyyndril's plight. Kivvaaa was saddened that many of the young Myyyndril had been killed by the Urnsor'is and did not want the spacer, whom she considered young, to be slain as well. Kivvaaa had dark [[brown]] hair.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKivvaaa first appeared in [[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees|''Rage of the Wookiees'']], a [[2005]] expansion pack for ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. In the [[video game]], Kivvaaa is the first character the player encounters during the \"Myyydril Trust\" quest line, allowing the player to continue on with the quest after a short conversation with her. Although the player does not need to take part in the quest, this article assumes 100 percent game completion.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Rage of the Wookiees}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Myyydril Trust}}\n\n[[Category:Cyborgs with prosthetics]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals with lost limbs]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
