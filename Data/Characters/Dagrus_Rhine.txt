Now get out of here before someone spots you.|Dagrus Rhine|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Dagrus Rhine''' was a corrupt [[Officer/Legends|officer]] of the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]].\n\nRhine was bribed several times by local criminal [[Kritus Morven]]. When Morven learned that the Royal Security Forces had started to search for his [[Spice/Legends|spice]] refineries, Morven tasked a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] with delivering an authorization of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to Rhine. In return, Rhine slowed the search down as much as he could, giving Morven the time to evacuate his refinery before it could be discovered.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:DagrusRhine.jpg|thumb|250px|Erroneous female depiction of Dagrus Rhine]]\nDagrus Rhine was a non-player character (NPC) in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. He would spawn somewhere outside of [[Keren/Legends|Keren]] during Kritus Morven's third mission.\n\nDagrus Rhine spawned under the generic \"rsf_security_guard\" template, resulting in him consistently appearing as a [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|haired]] Human female. This contradicted [[W:c:swg:Kritus Morven|Kritus Morven's]] [[W:c:swg:Quest|quest]] dialogue, who consistently referred to Rhine as a male. This article assumes that Rhine is [[canon]]ically a Human male in the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity, and that the female depiction is erroneous.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rhine, Dagrus}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Royal Naboo Security Force officers]]"}}}]}}}}
