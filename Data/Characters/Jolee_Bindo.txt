''Ooh''. Is that what you are wondering, huh? ''Ooh''.|Jolee Bindo|audio=Joleeooo.ogg|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Jolee Bindo''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who served the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. Having participated in several Rimward missions, Bindo fought against [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], and went into self-imposed exile on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] soon afterwards. Near the close of the [[Jedi Civil War]], he joined [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] against [[Darth Malak]] and the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Life as a Padawan===\n{{Quote|Let's just say that I was a strapping young lad with a head full of hair, and Coruscant was a small town with a well, heh heh.|Jolee Bindo, commenting on his age|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], Jolee Bindo was inducted into the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] at the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]]. During his days as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], Bindo was considered brash and reckless, often defying the will of the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] in order to do what he felt was right, as exemplified by his actions during the blockade of the [[Ukatis system]]. Cut off from the rest of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] by its own [[King/Legends|king]], the Ukatis system was unable to receive food and supplies, and no help from the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] was forthcoming. Bindo decided to help the people himself. He acquired a ship and was joined by a friend. Together they stole from the rich, considering it a \"tax on the greedy,\" and ran the supplies through the blockade to the planet.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nEventually, his craft was shot down on the planet by none other than his future wife, [[Nayama]], and the two were married, although marriage was frowned upon by many Jedi of the time. He discovered her to be strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and he took to training her personally despite the advice of the High Council and his Padawan status.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nDuring the [[Great Sith War/Legends|war]] with [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], his wife, like many other Jedi, fell to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. She attempted to turn Bindo, who resisted, culminating in a vicious [[Duel with Nayama|lightsaber duel]], which brought her to her knees. Unable to kill his own wife, Bindo let her go; this would ultimately lead to the deaths of many Jedi at her hands before she was finally struck down in battle. A sensitive topic for Bindo, the Jedi believed that he was unlucky in his life and just had, \"So many bad memories, some you never want to think about ever again.\" In fact, it took much prodding and questioning by [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] to extract any information about his wife at all, much less the entire story.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nThe Council did not punish Bindo for his actions, though, stating that he had learned his lesson the hard way. When instead they wished to promote him to the status of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], Bindo lost faith in the wisdom of the Council and went into self-exile, giving up his aspirations to be a [[Jedi Consular]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n===Exile on Kashyyyk===\n{{Quote|What's there to say? Jolee Bindo is the crazy old man who lives in the dangerous woods. I am content with the impression I give.|Jolee Bindo|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nAfter spending a year in the home of his good friend [[Sunry]], Bindo took to wandering the stars. He drifted for years, keeping employed when necessary. For a time he even took up smuggling, and he was not above using a Jedi [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to get past customs. Eventually he crashed on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] and explored the [[Shadowlands/Legends|Shadowlands]] for the next twenty years. At first, the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] believed him to be a benevolent forest spirit, calling him \"the hairless one,\" and so left gifts and fruits outside of his dwelling, until the old hermit explained the truth to them, albeit with some embarrassment, as he was knocked out cold by [[Freyyr]], who wanted to see if the spirit was solid. Still, Bindo remained a friend of the Wookiees, helping them protect the Shadowlands and its wildlife from poachers. He often wandered through the forest, ready to defend himself from predators, sentient or not, with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nLate during his wandering, he discovered an [[Builder Forge|ancient computer]] guarding a [[Star Map]], and ended up making 152 attempts to communicate with it; however, the computer had been secretly reprogrammed by Revan, during his first trip to Kashyyyk with [[Darth Malak]], to respond to nobody but himself.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n===Journey and friendship with Revan===\n{{Quote|Now let's get moving, shall we? If you stood still for this long in the Shadowlands, a [[Tach/Legends|tach]] would eat you!|Jolee Bindo|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:JoleeShadowlands.png|thumb|left|250px|Bindo defends himself from a pack of Katarns.]]\nWhen Revan passed through the Shadowlands a second time, once more seeking Star Maps, he encountered Bindo, who was fighting off a pack of [[Katarn/Legends|Katarns]]. Bindo attached himself to the party, partly out of boredom and partly to face his own past. He was one of the few members of the party to know Revan's true identity all along, although he decided that it was not his place to say. As he traveled with Revan, he was often reminded of an old friend, [[Nomi Sunrider]], whom he had known during his time as a Jedi.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nOn [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]], Jolee met his old friend Sunry when Sunry was awaiting trial for the murder of [[Elassa Huros]]. Although the ultimate outcome of the trial is not recorded, Jolee was greatly disturbed to learn that Sunry had committed the crime and was reluctant to accept Sunry's justification for the act.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nAt one point, Revan questioned Bindo as to why the old man had accompanied him. Bindo responded by relating the story of a man who followed a snake, only to be bitten and killed by it. When questioned about his motives by the snake, the man replied that he had been leading the snake away from his village. Revan could only puzzle over what his role in relation to the story was. Bindo's professed neutrality, already belied by joining Revan, was rendered further questionable when Revan landed on [[Lehon|Rakata Prime]], the home planet of the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]]. When the Rakatan priest caste allowed Revan into the [[Temple of the Ancients]] to disable the [[Star Forge]]'s disruptor field, they insisted on him going into the temple alone.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nBindo, however, persuaded the priests to allow him and fellow Jedi [[Juhani]] to strengthen Revan's resolve to not be seduced by the dark side again - this time by [[Bastila Shan]]. Bindo remained with Revan until the end, and along with Revan's other companions, was honored at the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic's]] celebration of their victory over Darth Malak.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nBindo dropped out of the public eye by the end of the [[Dark Wars]], serving the High Council in an absentee role for several years before disappearing completely. Several articles of clothing believed to have once belonged to him were in circulation during [[Meetra Surik]]'s journey to rebuild the Order.<ref>''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref> A [[holostatue]] of Bindo was erected in the [[Leisure Garden]] section of the [[Axial Park]] in the [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], along with the statues of Revan and his other companions.<ref name=\"Statues\">{{TORcite|type=faction|Republic|Bonus: Restoring the Statues|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Oh, I get it. Let's play with the old man's head, is it? He's half-senile, he'll forget I said anything! Wait, uh, what was this about, anyway?|Jolee Bindo|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:JoleeFullBody.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Jolee Bindo]]\nEven during his days with the Order, Bindo allowed emotion to drive his actions, and thus walked a fine line between the light and dark sides of the Force, claiming that he saw \"only in gray.\" Despite his view, Bindo clearly believed that there was evil in the galaxy, as witnessed during the fall of his wife to the dark side as well as his experiences during his time in the Ukatis System. Likewise, Bindo's \"gray\" view didn't stop him from having a stable position against the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and being a good man throughout his life.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nHe appeared as a cantankerous old man who readily dismissed the galaxy and its troubles with an impatient wave of his hand. Bindo appeared to outsiders as a grumpy old man, directing his scorn at both the young and old alike, but his care and wisdom still shone through the many layers he draped around his heart. He insisted that all he wanted was peace, and yet he was drawn back to war when Revan arrived in the Shadowlands for a second time. Bindo sensed a powerful destiny ahead of Revan, though he insisted that he was simply along for the ride. Even when Shan insisted that Bindo was a Jedi and needed the Order's structure, he waved her off, saying he had done plenty well without it.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nLikewise, he cautioned Carth Onasi's insistence that the universe would be irreparably changed should Malak succeed in collapsing the Republic:\n{{Quote|Heroes and tyrants rise and fall, and historians sort out the pieces&hellip; don't go thinking that this war&mdash;your war&mdash;is any more important than any other war simply because you're in it.|Bindo to Carth Onasi|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nJolee Bindo was prone to speaking in story and allegory, with a sense of humor that was wickedly sarcastic and more than a bit self-derisive. In addition to the snake story, he told the tale about a Jedi Master named [[Hortath]] (or possibly Hartoth, according to Bindo's own memory), who was blind and refused to believe he was, who met a Padawan who asked him for directions, not knowing that Hortath was blind. He followed the master's incorrect direction unthinkingly, and a Council who may have covered up for the blind master out of their own blind adherence to rank. Even his tale about Andor Vex was a cautionary tale intended to get Revan looking at the potential for folly. Still, he never considered himself Revan's teacher in any form:\n{{Quote|Don't coddle me, child, I'm neither a Jedi or your master. I'm just an old man who's been lost in the woods for far too long.|Bindo, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nIn his various conversations with Revan, Bindo appeared to stay on topic, at least for a little while, before (seemingly) randomly moving off into one of many various memories of someone he encountered or heard of as a Jedi Padawan in the Order, such as that of [[Hortath]] or [[Andor Vex]] (above). When asked the moral or meaning of these stories, he usually gave an answer similar to, ''\"Someone my age is entitled to ramble, dammit!\"'' Revan never really knew if there was a meaning to these stories, though they did keep him moderately entertained.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|I wasn't always the wrinkled coot I am now, you know. I can still fight, too, so wipe off that smirk I see there.|Jolee Bindo|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:JoleeBindo-KotORCG.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jolee Bindo using [[Animal bond|Beast Control]] on a creature on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]].]]\n\nDespite the fact that he followed the Jedi way and used the Force, Bindo did not consider himself part of the Order because of his history, or rather due to the fact that the Order had failed him. He never officially progressed beyond the rank of Padawan, although he explained to Revan once that he was to be knighted before he went into exile. His time in the Shadowlands only enhanced his survival skills. He had even learned to craft medicine from simple herbs, without any access to [[Kolto/Legends|kolto]] or medical supplies.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> He could also speak [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].<ref>''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nPhysically, despite his age, Bindo's time living in the dangerous Shadowlands kept his body in shape and nimble and saw him into dangerous situations on a regular basis. Even though [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]] was not his primary strength compared to his command of the Force, the very first time he talked to Revan, several [[Katarn/Legends|katarns]] had fallen to his [[Jolee Bindo's lightsaber|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nIn their travels, Bindo would display his signature talent for Jedi [[Mind trick/Legends|Mind tricks]], something he thought could serve them well when [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]] ambushed them, if he was going to be their [[Skirmish aboard the Leviathan|''Leviathan'' prison break]] agent. He possessed a unique personality that allowed him to command the Force through both its light and dark sides. Lack of records have made it impossible to know the specific extent of Bindo's powers, but he could have potentially mastered dark arts such as [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] as easily as any other power, which would have been nearly unthinkable for most light-sided Jedi of the time.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />  He possessed some skill in [[Telekinesis/Legends|damaging his opponents internal organs]] with the Force. <ref name=\"KOTORCampaign\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Why, the master *loves* tombs, Don't you, *Master*?|Jolee Bindo|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Joleeart.jpg|thumb|Early concept art of Jolee.]]\nJolee Bindo is a playable character in the computer and video games ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. He was voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]],<ref name=\"KOTOR\" /> and was written by [[David Gaider]].<ref name=\"Twitter\">{{Twitter|davidgaider|status/1389640959072215040|David Gaider|quote=Every time I list the things I wrote on KotOR, I forget about Jolee Bindo.|archivedate=20210505072220}}</ref>\n\nHis [[Databank (original)|Databank]] entry claims that: \"Though a useful ally, Jolee is not crucial to the completion of the KOTOR storyline.\"<ref name=\"databank\" /> This is contradictory because Revan actually needs Bindo to get past a [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka]] [[Force field/Legends|force field]] that stands in his way to one of the [[Star Map]]s as he is the only one who could get past that force field and he is an obligate party member in the [[Temple of the Ancients]].<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nAlso, the face-off with Bastila Shan on the Temple is a re-run of Bindo's with Nayama, of which Revan learns during their journeys; there is little margin for error that Revan's final choice of allegiance and final confrontation with Bastila were meant to be influenced by Bindo's experience. Despite his issues with the Order, when he was called to make a choice, Bindo proclaimed his standing with the Jedi; he did so with Sunry, and would with Revan if he chose to reclaim the mantle of Dark Lord. His tendency to follow the light side is also matched by a Force alignment score of 55.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nPromotional pictures depict Bindo wielding a blue-bladed lightsaber instead of the green one he wields in-game, which is the signature color for his [[Jedi Consular]] class. Game files indicate that, like Bastila Shan and Juhani, Bindo too was meant to have his own special ability, namely [[Mind trick/Legends|Psychic Static]], an advanced Mind trick variant.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', there are two items that might have belonged to Bindo: [[Bindo's band]] and [[Jolee's robe]]. In the same game, [[Brianna]] asks the [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]] about how love conflicts with the Jedi Code, saying that either the lovers would be removed from the order or must maintain a secret love. The Exile responds by calling it \"Pulling a Bindo.\" This is a reference to Bindo when he married secretly.\n\nIn the non-canonical dark side story, Revan embraced the dark side at the [[Temple of the Ancients]] summit on the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] home world. He reclaimed his title of Darth Revan, Dark Lord of the Sith and accepted [[Bastila Shan]] as his apprentice. Jolee Bindo and [[Juhani]] tried to prevent this but they were struck down by Darth Revan and his new apprentice.<ref name=\"KOTOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Jolee Bindo|imagecat=Images of Jolee Bindo}}\n{{Wq}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Old Republic: Revan (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Revan'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*[[Cartel Market|''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' Cartel Market]] {{C|Outfit}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Chronicles of the Old Republic]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|joleebindo|Bindo, Jolee|archivedate=20100209211244}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR Wiki}}\n\n{{K1char}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Jolee Bindo\n|de=Jolee Bindo\n|el=\u03a4\u03b6\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9 \u039c\u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\n|es=Jolee Bindo\n|fi=Jolee Bindo\n|fr=Jolee Bindo\n|hu=Jolee Bindo\n|pl=Jolee Bindo\n|pt=Legends:Jolee Bindo\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0411\u0438\u043d\u0434\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bindo, Jolee}}\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Gray Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Consulars]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
