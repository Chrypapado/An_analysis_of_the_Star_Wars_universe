You've done enough for us.|Scientist Talie Heathe advises group scout \"Tic Verdun\" (alias of [[Void in the Force|Force Blank]], [[Granta Omega]]).|Jedi Quest: The Master of Disguise}}\n'''Talie Heathe''' was a slender [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] specializing in [[Ocean/Legends|oceanics]], who lived in the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].\n\nIn [[26 BBY/Legends|26 BBY]], Talie Heathe traveled with fellow scientists [[Fort Turan]], [[Tic Verdun]], [[Joveh D'a Alin]], and [[Reug Yucon]], on an expedition to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Haariden]] to carry out investigations on geological and [[Volcano/Legends|volcanic]] activities there, to accomplish global mapping for the mineral [[titanite]], and to determine the effects of the world's environment on its ecosystem.\n\nIn the midst of their research, however, the scientists found themselves caught up in a raging civil war and soon became stranded when their [[Starship/Legends|ship]] malfunctioned. Pinned down in the countryside, they were able to send a distress call to the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] (the sponsor of their mapping mission) while attempting to negotiate a truce between the opposing forces on the planet. Fearing that the scientists would be held as hostages or bargaining chips in the ongoing conflict, the Senate appealed to the Jedi for help.\n\nThe scientists were eventually found by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], [[Soara Antana/Legends|Soara Antana]], and [[Darra Thel-Tanis]], who were dispatched on a [[Mission to Haariden|rescue mission]] to the crisis-bound planet by the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]]. From a deserted village holdout (in war-besieged [[Tenuuri]]), the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]\u2014leading them safely through perilous, war-pocked terrain\u2014protected the scientists, until all were able eventually to flee the planet.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The Master of Disguise]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Talie Heathe\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heathe, Talie}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Space explorers]]"}}}]}}}}
