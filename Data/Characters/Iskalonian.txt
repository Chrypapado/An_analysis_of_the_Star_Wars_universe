All seventeen of these species were relocated from their own [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworlds]] to Iskalon circa [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]].\n\n==Biology and appearance==\nThe six main species in [[the School]] were the [[Inleshat]], [[Chuhkyvi]], [[Striber]]s, [[Graygl]], [[Nejma]], and the [[Frid]].\n\nAmong the other species represented in the School was that of a [[Gender/Legends|female]] Iskalonian named [[Dania Francis]]. [[Dania Francis's species]] had a humanoid torso, a [[Horse/Legends|horse]]-like face, a [[Fish/Legends|fish]]-like lower body featuring a finless tail carried curled forward, wing-like fins attached to her shoulders, and additional fins running the length of her lower body. Francis also had purple skin, white hair, and white eyes.<ref name=\"Star Wars 102\">[[Star Wars (1977) 102|''Star Wars'' (1977) 102]]</ref>\n\nAnother Iskalonian of [[Unidentified green species|unidentified species]] had a fish-like appearance (distinct from that of a Frid), green skin, large white eyes with thick eyelids, and a fin on his or her head which formed a spiny crest. This Iskalonian had a face resembling a [[Dog/Legends|dog's]] muzzle.<ref name=\"Star Wars 74\">[[Star Wars (1977) 74|''Star Wars'' (1977) 74]]</ref>\n\n==History==\nAround five hundred years before the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]], a number of needy Iskalonian locals were approached by recruiters sent by [[Hugo Bartyn]]. Bartyn wanted amphibian fishermen to settle a new city in [[Lamaredd/Legends|Lamaredd]] and tempted these poverty-stricken individuals with promises of untouched seas in a new frontier. Once they arrived, however, they became [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] laborers. Most of the Iskalonians refused, and they were banished to an almost-sure death in the open seas.<ref name=\"BL\">{{GamerCite|7|Bartyn's Landing (article)|Bartyn's Landing}}</ref>\n\nThough they built the underwater city of [[Pavillion]] to interact with water-breathing visitors to Iskalon, it was destroyed in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]] after an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] attack set off an enormous tidal wave. Afterwards, the Iskalonians withdrew from [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy's]] affairs. [[Kiro]] was an exception to this, as he briefly left his homeworld for several adventures alongside [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]].\n\n==Iskalonians in the galaxy==\nThe Iskalonians continued their isolationist ways, even after a brief invasion by the [[Nagai]] was driven off (thanks to Kiro and Skywalker). The Iskalonians did not join the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].\n\n{{Species-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 74|''Star Wars'' (1977) 74]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 75|''Star Wars'' (1977) 75]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 76|''Star Wars'' (1977) 76]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 82|''Star Wars'' (1977) 82]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 87|''Star Wars'' (1977) 87]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 95|''Star Wars'' (1977) 95]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 96|''Star Wars'' (1977) 96]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 97|''Star Wars'' (1977) 97]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 102|''Star Wars'' (1977) 102]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GalaxyCite|3|ComicScan|ComicScan: Marvelously Silly Aliens}}\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*{{GamerCite|1|The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Marvel Series}}\n*{{GamerCite|7|Bartyn's Landing (article)|Bartyn's Landing}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030703ando|text=Ando: Planet of the Walrus Men|int=Ando: Planet of the Walrus Men|archivedate=20100328020111}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20031211troopers|text=Hazard and Rocket Troopers|int=Hazard and Rocket Troopers|archivedate=20091117224458}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/source/nagai11202009/index.html|text=The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs|int=The Forgotten War: The Nagai and the Tofs}}\n*{{SW|url=news/barely-tolerable-alien-henchmen-of-the-empire-part-1|text=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 1|int=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Iskalonier\n|es=Iskaloniano\n|nl=Iskalonian\n|ru=\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0446\u044b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Aquatic sentient species]]\n[[Category:Iskalonians| ]]\n[[Category:Mid Rim species]]"}}}]}}}}
