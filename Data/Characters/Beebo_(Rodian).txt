This character's skill would depend on the player character's and a dice roll. Should the player character compete with this person, Beebo would appear dead soon afterwards, killed by The Cell because the PC could filter Beebo's name as a Cell member.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[TopWorld]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Beebo\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
