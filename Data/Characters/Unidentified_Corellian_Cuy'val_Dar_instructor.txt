As a [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]], he was one of the few non-[[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Sergeant/Legends|sergeants]] in the ''Cuy'val Dar''. He trained the [[Commando/Legends|commandos]] of [[Galaar Squad]], which included [[IC-4447|Ennen]] and [[Bry (clone trooper)|Bry]], who, after the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], joined their fellow clones [[Darman Skirata|Darman]] and [[Niner Skirata|Niner]] to form [[Squad 40]].<ref name=\"ImpCom501st\" />\n\n==History==\nThe Corellian was one of the 25 non-[[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]]<ref name=\"ImpCom501st\" /> members of ''Cuy'val Dar'',<ref name=\"Triple Zero\">''[[Republic Commando: Triple Zero]]''</ref> conscripted by [[Jango Fett]] around [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]].<ref name=\"Triple Zero\" /> The Corellian was tasked with training [[Clone commando]]s on [[Kamino]]. He trained the clone commandos of [[Galaar Squad]], but lost two of them, most likely during training.<ref>In the novel ''[[Imperial Commando: 501st]]'', [[Darman Skirata|Darman]] mocks the commandos of Galaar Squad, stating that they sat out throughout the war. ''[[The Clone Wars Campaign Guide]]'' states that [[Special Operations Brigade/Legends|Special Operations Brigade]] units, such as Galaar Squad consisted of four men. By [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], only Bry and Ennen are alive. Therefore, it can be assumed that the other two members of Galaar Squad died in training.</ref> The Corellian was apart of the ''Cuy'val Dar'' until [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], when the ''Cuy'val Dar'' was fragmented.<ref name=\"Triple Zero\" />\n\nThe commandos stayed out of the war until the formation of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], where they were conscripted to serve, being conjoined with another commando unit, [[Omega Squad]], who had two members desert from the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army]].<ref name=\"ImpCom501st\" /><ref>''[[Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel]]''</ref> They were put into a unit known as [[Squad 40]]. However, on their first mission, Bry was killed by a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] by the name of [[Iri Camas]]. [[IC-4447]] was performing another standard op - executing any [[Jedi]] they came into contact with - and accidentally killed a civilian. He would commit [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]], either because of the death of Bry or the death of the civilian.<ref name=\"ImpCom501st\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Imperial Commando: 501st]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Cuy'val Dar]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified military personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
