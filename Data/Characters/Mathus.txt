When he attempted to rob a [[Honwoo's repair shop|repair shop]], the owner&mdash;an old [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] named [[Honwoo]]&mdash;saw the [[Youngling/Legends|boy's]] potential and interest in mechanical devices. Honwoo invited Mathus to assist in repairing and [[Programmer/Legends|reprogramming]] the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] that were brought in for servicing. Mathus abandoned his life as a street [[thug]] and accepted a trade as a [[Technician/Legends|technician]], with Honwoo as his mentor. Mathus had a skill for repurposing and refitting devices, and even succeeded in transforming a pair of [[Power converter/Legends|power converters]] into a pair of [[shock glove]]s.\n\nMathus gained renown as a droid expert, bringing him to the attention of the ruler of [[Mos Shuuta]], the [[Hutt Cartel|cartel]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] [[Teemo]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. Teemo invited the Human to work for him, promising Mathus high pay for the position. Mathus initially accepted but, when he realized that the job's requirements exceeded his capabilities, then tried to leave. Teemo&mdash;not interested in losing his droid expert&mdash;threatened Mathus with Honwoo's well-being, forcing Mathus to reconsider his involvement with the Hutt. He then began secretly planning his departure from Tatooine and enlisted the help of others caught in Teemo's service to carry out the escape.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Edge_of_the_Empire_Mathus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mathus at work]]\nMathus was orphaned at a very young age during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Having no direction for his technical genius, he joined a gang of [[thug]]s in the streets of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]], [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. When he attempted to rob the [[Honwoo's repair shop|repair shop]] of an old [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]] named [[Honwoo]], the shop owner noticed the [[Youngling/Legends|boy's]] interest in a partially stripped [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] array sitting on the workbench. Seeing Mathus' potential, Honwoo offered to teach him how it worked, also promising him the opportunity to be trained as a technician. From that point onward, Mathus abandoned his life as a miscreant on the streets and apprenticed under Honwoo.<ref name=\"Folio\" />\n\nMathus subsequently learned about everything that came through the repair shop&mdash;mainly involving repairing and [[Programmer/Legends|reprogramming]] [[Droid/Legends|droids]]. Without having had formal [[Academy|academic]] instruction, Mathus used what he learned&mdash;along with his purportedly incredible intellect&mdash;to successfully tinker and fix droids through effective use of trial and error. He was particularly interested in refitting and repurposing machines, and even transformed a pair of [[Power converter/Legends|power converters]] into [[shock glove]]s. This gained him a reputation as a \"droid expert,\" which drew the attention of [[Teemo]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]].<ref name=\"Folio\" />\n\nTeemo offered the Human a high-paying position at his [[Teemo's palace|complex]] in [[Mos Shuuta]]. Although the amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] appealed to Mathus enough to accept the job, he afterward found that his qualifications did not meet the position's requirements. Teemo's main goal in hiring Mathus was to have his stock of old and rusty [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] reconditioned and reverse-engineered&mdash;with schematics developed from their design&mdash;in order to build himself a personal droid [[Army/Legends|army]].<ref name=\"TLAofH\">\"[[The Long Arm of the Hutt]]\"</ref> Due to his lack of higher education, Mathus was limited in proficiency to the maintenance and repair of the droids.<ref name=\"Folio\" />\n\nWhen Mathus attempted to excuse himself from Teemo's service, however, Teemo hinted a threat to Honwoo's safety if Mathus refused to continue as an employee. Thus, Mathus resolved to escape and [[Slicer/Legends|introduced]] an altered code into Teemo's customized [[Medical droid/Legends|medical]] and [[maintenance droid]], [[41-VEX]], in order to encourage it to also escape.<ref name=\"Folio\" /> 41-VEX subsequently carried out the coded suggestion by first releasing Teemo's gladiator, [[Lowhhrick/Legends|Lowhhrick]], who removed 41-VEX's [[Restraining bolt/Legends|restraining bolt]] to allow the droid to follow through with its new imperative. 41-VEX introduced the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] to [[Pash]], a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] who was also trying to quit Teemo's service, and the group subsequently fled from Teemo's palace.<ref name=\"EfMS\">\"[[Escape from Mos Shuuta]]\"</ref> Mathus additionally befriended a local [[Scout/Legends|scout]] named [[Sasha]] and enlisted her help in getting them off-[[Planet/Legends|planet]].<ref name=\"Folio\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMathus was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and dark skin. He purportedly displayed a great intelligence and overcame educational limitations to develop his skills as a technician. However, he was prone to forgetting immediate concerns when presented with a mechanical problem to solve&mdash;even forgetting to rob Honwoo when invited to assist the Rodian in working on a repulsorlift array. He displayed both a tendency to be impulsive as well as an ability to adapt to his environment and circumstances. He was rash in accepting Teemo the Hutt's offer without deliberating enough to understand his lack qualifications. However, when faced with Teemo's use of Honwoo as leverage to coerce cooperation, Mathus obscured his continued efforts to leave, showing that he understood that the importance of his own life&mdash;and that of his old Rodian mentor&mdash;was tenuous despite his ability.<ref name=\"Folio\" />\n\nMathus also showed resourcefulness in programming the intent to leave Teemo into 41-VEX, as well as courage to go through with an escape, despite threats to prevent him from attempting to do so. He also displayed a gregarious ability, making connections with people who could satisfy his needs, such as when he made friends with Sasha the [[Scout/Legends|explorer]] with the intent of using her talents to safely transport him and 41-VEX off Tatooine.<ref name=\"Folio\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMathus was described in a biography written on the back page of \"Mathus the Technician,\" an 8-page character folio published online on [[December 14]], [[2012]] as a free download for the [[Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game|''Star Wars: Edge of the Empire'' Beginner Game]]. His image was portrayed on the face of the folio, establishing his physical characteristics. He is also shown in the cover art wearing a pair of [[Gauntlet/Legends|gauntlets]] that apparently represent the shock gloves that the character is equipped with.<ref name=\"Folio\" /> The biography introduced elements of the continuing adventures of the player's characters outlined in the Beginner Game's second story, \"[[The Long Arm of the Hutt]]\" bonus adventure,<ref name=\"TLAofH\" /> as well as identifying him as having sliced a code into 41-VEX to make it also want to leave Teemo's service in the first story, \"[[Escape from Mos Shuuta]].\"<ref name=\"EfMS\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Long Arm of the Hutt]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game|''Star Wars: Edge of the Empire'' Beginner Game]], \"Mathus the Technician\" character folio {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]"}}}]}}}}
