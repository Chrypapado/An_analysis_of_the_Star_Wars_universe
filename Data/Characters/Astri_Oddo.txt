She came to meet [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] through her father. Later, when Obi-Wan's [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] was captured and her father shot by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Ona Nobis]], she went with Obi-Wan to find [[Jenna Zan Arbor]], who held [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] captive, and the cure for Didi. She then \"married a homesteader in the Outer Rim.\"<ref name=\"Trail\">''[[Jedi Quest: The Trail of the Jedi]]''</ref> She was later married to [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Bog Divinian]], by whom she had a son, [[Lune Oddo Divinian]]. However, with the Jedi's help she left Bog behind for a long while, after taking up Nuralee as her adopted homeworld.\n\n===Running from Bog===\nIn [[18 BBY/Legends|18 BBY]], she sabotaged the computer systems of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Samaria]] with the permission of prime minister [[Aaren Larker]], prompting [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] to send [[Ferus Olin]] to hunt her down. However, the ex-Jedi instead helped her and her son escape the clutches of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], and relocate on an secret asteroid base located in an atmospheric storm near the planet of [[Acherin]].\nLater, she as well as her son [[Lune Oddo Divinian|Lune]] went to live in the Orange Sector of Coruscant, in the safe house of [[Dexter Jettster/Legends|Dex]].\n\n===Lune's kidnapping===\nShe spent much time with the [[Erased]] and trusted them enough to send [[Keets Freely]] and [[Curran Caladian]] to look after [[Lune Oddo Divinian|Lune]]. Unfortunately [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]] kidnapped Lune to train as an Imperial [[Pilot/Legends|Pilot]]. But Dexter sent [[Trever Flume]] and [[Ferus Olin]] to save him. She was very grateful to have Lune returned.\n\n===Tracking Flame===\nWhen a mysterious young woman named [[Eve Yarrow|Flam]] arrived to create a Rebellion team called [[Moonstrike (Acherin)|Moonstrike]], a friend of Ferus, [[Clive Flax]], suspected her as an Imperial [[Spy/Legends|spy]]. He asked Astri to help. They then discovered that Flame was in fact Eve Yarrow, and that she was in league with the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. Clive and her then contacted the [[Jedi asteroid|base]], warning them of this.\n\nAfter the base was destroyed by Vader's superweapon, Astri and Clive agreed to adopt [[Trever Flume|Trever]] after his memory was wiped to protect him, making him forget what he knew about Darth Vader's real identity and everything that happened in the last year.\n\nAstri was killed along with Clive and Trever in their attempt to destroy an Imperial factory on Bellazura. Their son, Lune Divinian was unable to participate in the battle, and thus survived.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Deadly Hunter]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Evil Experiment]]''\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Dangerous Rescue]]''\n*''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]''\n*[[Jedi Quest 3|''Jedi Quest'' 3]]\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The Trail of the Jedi]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The Dangerous Games]]''\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The False Peace]]''\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: A Tangled Web]]''\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Return of the Dark Side]]''\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Secret Weapon]]''\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Against the Empire]]''\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Master of Deception]]''\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Reckoning]]''\n*''[[Rebel Force: Firefight]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Rebel Force: Trapped]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Rebel Force: Uprising]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*{{FFCite|54|COR24-26, ''Coruscant - Dex's Diner''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 4]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|location|dexsdiner|Dex's Diner|archivedate=20100327211231}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Astri Oddo\n|es=Astri Oddo\n|nl=Astri Oddo\n|pl=Astri Oddo\n|ru=\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u041e\u0434\u0434\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oddo, Astri}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]\n[[Category:Waiters]]"}}}]}}}}
