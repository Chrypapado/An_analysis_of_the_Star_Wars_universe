They were searching for a supposed network of [[Selonian/Legends|Selonian]] tunnels that apparently predated the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]]. Although Sionaro's colleagues were skeptical, their research seemed to show promise. But then a herd of local animals started to endanger the team's encampment, which upset the students and threatened to drastically set back the doctor's schedule. After an appeal to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] for help was declined, Coronet University granted additional stipend to pay a well-armed individual for eliminating the creatures. Sionaro used the money to hire a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who hunted and killed the creatures and so permitted the [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] to continue his or her research.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDr. Sionaro is the creator of a mission in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' called \"Coronet Archaeology Site Menaced\" that was available on Mission Terminals on Corellia.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sionaro, Tennet}}\n[[Category:Archaeologists]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]"}}}]}}}}
