As she progressed down the path of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], Aleema became a [[Sith sorcerer|Sith sorceress]], gaining proficiency in the arts of [[Sith magic]]. She and Satal also co-founded the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]], a secret [[Sith cult/Legends|dark side society]], and together they succeeded in [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|overthrowing]] the [[Tetan Monarchy]] just prior to the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].\n\nAs co-rulers of the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]], Aleema and her cousin instigated the [[Krath Holy Crusade]], the [[Battle of Koros Major|opening battle]] of which revealed the measure of their Sith powers at work in Tetan [[Realspace/Legends|space]]. The Krath then launched a bold [[Battle of Deneba|ambush]] against the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] during a [[Jedi Convocation|convocation]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Deneba/Legends|Deneba]], which resulted in the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]]. In response, his [[Padawan/Legends|apprentice]], the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], [[Mission to Empress Teta|infiltrated]] the Krath in an attempt to destroy them from within. Aleema immediately realized his intentions and seduced him while offering him a position within the Krath organization. She then masterminded the [[First Duel in the Iron Citadel|death]] of her cousin Satal at Qel-Droma's hands, at which time the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|fallen Jedi]] assumed Satal's position as leader of the Krath.\n\nTogether with Qel-Droma, Aleema joined forces with [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] and held position as his senior ally in Kun's [[Brotherhood of the Sith|Sith Brotherhood]]. War was waged against the Jedi and the Republic, though during an [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Sith War)|assault]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Keto betrayed Qel-Droma to the enemy. She was later killed by her own actions when she used her Sith powers to [[Supernova (Sith magic)|cause]] a massive [[Supernova/Legends|supernova]] in the [[Cron Cluster/Legends|Cron Cluster]] during the [[Battle of Kemplex IX]], having been tricked into the affair by both Kun and Qel-Droma.\n\n==Biography==\n===Coruscant endeavor===\n{{Quote|This is it, Satal!

Bored and spoiled, she, Satal, and some of their aristocrat friends formed a secret society called the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]], so named after a fairy-tale [[Krath (mythology)|magician-god]]. The cousins learned much from their tutors about the ancient [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], which instigated the [[Great Hyperspace War/Legends|Great Hyperspace War]] in [[5000 BBY/Legends|5000 BBY]]&mdash;so much so that they were compelled to explore the history further on their own.<ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\nThe Keto children took a trip to the [[Galactic Museum]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] in search of more knowledge on the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. In the museum, they perused a [[The Dark Lords of the Sith|hall dedicated]] to Sith history and managed to steal a [[Sith spellbook|book]] of Sith lore, only to find that they could not understand the ancient text. Dejected, they went back to their hotel, and while scanning the news reports, heard about [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Dark Side Adept|adepts]] on [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] who were terrorizing the populace with their dark powers.<ref name=\"FNU1\" />\n\nIntrigued by this new knowledge, the pair traveled to the war-torn [[Planet/Legends|planet]] aboard the [[Tetan Royal Space Yacht]] known as the ''[[Krath Enchanter]]'', with hopes of locating any Sith affiliate who might aid them in unlocking the secrets of the book. They arrived on Onderon to find a massive [[Second Battle of Onderon|battle]] taking place between [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] forces and the [[Naddist]]s, a cult following of the ancient [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Freedon Nadd]]. Their yacht was shot down in the midst of a [[Rocket-Jumper Elite Advance Unit|Republic rocket-jumper]] deployment, and crashed in the Onderonian capital of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], where they just barely escaped their exploding vessel into the streets. After spending some time showing their acquisition around and inquiring about the Sith, they were finally brought before Onderon's monarch, [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]].<ref name=\"FNU1\" />\n\nOmmin was curious about these two potential Sith initiates and their ancient Sith text, and so agreed to help them. Satal openly expressed his apprehension, fearing that the old King did not possess the knowledge they sought. All that changed however, when King Ommin worked his dark magic on Satal, rendering him ill and opening Aleema further to the dark side. Ommin then showed them his prized collection of [[Sith amulet]]s, one in particular that allowed them to read Sith writings. The decrepit King agreed to give Satal the amulet, but under one condition: Ommin must be allowed to take a copy of the spell book for himself. Satal acquiesced, and while a scribe transcribed the text, Ommin showed them the captive [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]], hung on a wall and [[Torture/Legends|suffering]] heavily under [[Sith magic]]. As Ommin leaned in close to taunt Jeth, a team of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] crashed the royal palace to free him. Ommin was caught off-guard as his forces were soundly defeated by Jeth's rescuers.<ref name=\"FNU2\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 2]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] quickly triumphed, and just as Jedi Knight [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] smashed Ommin's [[Durasteel/Legends|durasteel]] exoskeleton to incapacitate him, the ancient spirit of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] Freedon Nadd appeared. With Republic forces and the Jedi Knights now in complete control of the city, Nadd realized Ommin had failed in his task of restoring the glory of the Sith; instead, the Sith Lord convinced Aleema and Satal that they held the key to building a new Sith Empire and that he would guide them. Eventually, the Jedi freed Arca Jeth, and Qel-Droma slew Ommin.<ref name=\"FNU2\" />\n\n===Trouble for the Republic===\n{{Quote|If the proud soldiers of Koros Major can be confounded by magic... we can take on the Jedi themselves!''\"<br />\"''Check the scanner, Satal. I think you're about to get your chance.|Aleema and Satal Keto|audio=AleemaKetoTroublefortheRepublic-DLOTS.ogg|Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)}}\n[[File:MagicAleema.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aleema prepares to harass the Republic Fleet with her illusions.]]\nAleema and Satal then fled Onderon with a collection of ancient Sith artifacts and texts and used them to become proficient in Sith sorcery. Now the way was clear for the Krath to immediately begin plotting their rise to power. Armed with her new Sith knowledge, Aleema was instrumental in bringing down their parents, the legitimate rulers of the Empress Teta [[Star system/Legends|system]]. During a visit to her uncle's [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] [[Tetan carbonite smelter|processing facility]], Aleema, along with Satal, caused an uproar when their escort, [[Korus]], revealed that Aleema replaced his tongue with an [[Adegan eel]]. Reeling with confusion and anger, Lord Keto demanded that she and Satal be arrested. Aleema, however, stopped Lord Keto's guards by using her Sith talents to transform the guardsmen's weapons into illusory snakes.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" />\n\nWith the guards out of the way, she even went so far as to have Lord Keto lowered into a vat of molten carbonite, leaving her and Satal as the unchallenged rulers of Empress Teta. Korus did not survive the upstaging either; Aleema used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and burned him alive simply for spilling a drink on her. After the Krath had successfully staged their [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|political coup]], Aleema and Satal took up residence in the [[Iron Citadel/Legends|Iron Citadel]], the building where Lord Keto formally held court, making it their base of operations. They immediately began a plan to unify the worlds of the Tetan system under their heel. However, the system's citizens, specifically the Krath's home planet of Empress Teta, rebelled against their new Krath rulers.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" />\n\nIn an effort to restore order in the Tetan system, a joint Jedi and Republic battalion was sent to deal with the usurpers. Aleema and Satal were more than prepared for the Republic, and took up command from a [[Space station/Legends|space station]] [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] Empress Teta. As the Republic forces emerged from [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], the Krath met them head-on. Aleema used her sorcery to create illusions of [[space grazer]]s, legendary creatures that roamed [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] preying upon interstellar spacecraft. The space grazer illusions were lifelike enough to fool [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vanicus]] and the Republic [[Republic Navy|fleet]] during the [[Battle of Koros Major|Battle for Empress Teta]], almost forcing the panicking [[Commander/Legends|commanders]] into retreat. However, the Jedi [[Nomi Sunrider]] saw through the deception, and used her [[battle meditation]] to confound Aleema, thus allowing the Republic forces to ignore the apparitions. Drawing upon the sum of her powers, Aleema created a mass illusion to conceal a screen of [[CX-133 Chaos fighter]] suicide bombers launched by Satal. The Chaos fighters harassed the Republic fleet, and Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma was injured when one of the Krath vessels plunged into the command [[Starship/Legends|ship]] he was on. Although Sunrider was able to distract and defeat Aleema, the Republic detachment was forced to withdraw in the face of such a blatant attack, leaving the Krath in complete control of the system.<ref name=\"DLOTS\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 2]]</ref>\n\n===Seducing a Jedi===\n{{Quote|I'm enjoying our contest, but I'm winning too easily, Ulic. Perhaps I want you to be stronger. Perhaps I'd like to be conquered.|Aleema, to Ulic Qel-Droma|audio=AleemaKetoSeducingAJedi-DLOTS.ogg|Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)}}\nSome time later, Aleema and Satal used [[Krath war droid/Legends|Krath war droids]] disguised as [[Service droid/Legends|service droids]] to attack the [[Conclave at Deneba|Conclave on Deneba]], where the Jedi had gathered to discuss the growing Krath threat. During the assault, Master Arca Jeth was slain, and his student, Ulic Qel-Droma, swore revenge on the Krath.<ref name=\"DTTDS\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 3|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 3]]</ref> Consumed by grief over the death of Jeth, Qel-Droma soon after attempted to infiltrate the Krath in hopes of destroying them from within. He arrived on Empress Teta and made his way to [[Cinnagar/Legends|Cinnagar]], the capital city. Aleema sensed Qel-Droma's great strength in the Force and was wary of him, but she devised a plan for turning him to the dark side. During a [[Mission to Empress Teta|skirmish]] in Cinnagar, she let Qel-Droma \"save\" her from a fake [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] attempt, and managed to take him as her lover to win his trust. However, Satal grew jealous and suspicious, and he had Qel-Droma interrogated and tortured in the dungeons of the Iron Citadel. Despite Qel-Droma denying that he was a Jedi [[Spy/Legends|spy]], Satal injected him with a [[Sith poison]], which played off and amplified an individual's rage. By doing this, Satal was confident that Qel-Droma's anger would activate his poison, and ensure the Jedi's fall to the dark side.<ref name=\"DOADJ\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 4|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 4]]</ref>\n[[File:AleemaSithCrystals.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Aleema during the Great Sith War.]]\nAfter a failed attempt by Nomi Sunrider and her Jedi cohorts to rescue Qel-Droma, Satal again questioned Qel-Droma's loyalty and attempted to have him assassinated. The vengeful Jedi repelled the attack and then [[First Duel in the Iron Citadel|confronted]] Satal, striking him down in anger. Qel-Droma also rebuked Sunrider and the Jedi, and despite their pleas, refused to leave Cinnagar with them. Aleema knew her seduction was successful, and that Qel-Droma was falling further and further to the dark side. She revealed to Qel-Droma that she was aware of his infiltration scheme all along, and saw it as a challenge for the both of them. Now convinced that he could not turn away from the dark path even if he wanted to, she took him as her official partner, and they became the new co-rulers of the Krath.<ref name=\"DOADJ\" />\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] was also in Cinnagar in search of them. Before Freedon Nadd died his second death, he warned Aleema of Kun's treachery. Kun was aware of this and saw Nadd's other students as potential threats to his work in restoring the Sith Empire. Arriving in the Iron Citadel, Kun caught Aleema and Qel-Droma by surprise as he confronted them. Aleema attempted to halt Kun's advance, but he quickly incapacitated her with a [[Sith magic#Force Blast|blast]] of dark side energy. He then [[Second Duel in the Iron Citadel|dueled]] Qel-Droma, and during their contest the matching Sith amulets that each man wore began to interact, stirring the ancient spirit of the long-dead Sith Lord [[Marka Ragnos]]. Ragnos halted the duel and issued a proclamation, initiating both men as Dark Lords of the Sith. Aleema awoke to see a changed Qel-Droma, one with a new [[Sith tattoo|tattoo]] stamped on his forehead and in allegiance with the Dark Jedi Kun. Kun planned to restore the Sith, and together with Aleema's Krath, a new [[Brotherhood of the Sith|Sith Brotherhood]] was born.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\nSix months later, Qel-Droma confronted [[Mandalore the Indomitable]] in a [[Duel on Kuar|duel]] to the death on the planet [[Kuar/Legends|Kuar]]. Qel-Droma was triumphant, and instead of cutting Mandalore down, Qel-Droma made the [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] and his forces swear fealty to him. The Krath, along with the Dark Lord Exar Kun and their [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] allies, then laid out plans for toppling the Republic. After successfully [[Battle of Foerost (Great Sith War)|capturing]] a fleet of battleships during an attack on the planet [[Foerost/Legends|Foerost]], Qel-Droma planned to use them in an attempt to wrest power from the government on Coruscant. Kun was against this idea, as he sought to first train twenty Dark Jedi to also join the Brotherhood. Qel-Droma, however, had no intentions of waiting for Kun. He and Aleema proceeded with their [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Sith War)|assault on Coruscant]] without their partner, who continued with his new students. Aleema used this opportunity to further her own plans for power, and as Qel-Droma prepared to take the Republic command center, Aleema ordered Mandalore to withdraw their [[Troop/Legends|troops]]. Qel-Droma was unaware of Aleema's treachery as his former Jedi companions stormed the command center. The Jedi [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] him in a [[Force Light|wall]] of [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] energy and whisked him away to be put on trial for his crimes against the Republic.<ref name=\"TSW2\" /> Qel-Droma was [[Inquisition (Old Republic)|brought before]] the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] to be judged for his actions.<ref name=\"TSW3\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War 3|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War'' 3]]</ref>\n\n===Fatal betrayal===\n{{Quote|Jedi ships are approaching, Aleema.

I've got a surprise for them&hellip;|Aleema, to Crado|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi &mdash; The Sith War}}\nBack in the Iron Citadel, Aleema sided up next to Mandalore in an attempt break his loyalty to Qel-Droma. She ordered him to ready their forces for the next assault, which would be on the valuable [[Kemplex IX]] relay station in the [[Auril sector/Legends|Auril sector]]. Mandalore was not content with taking orders solely from the sorceress Aleema, and so he left in search of Exar Kun on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] to request his assistance in rescuing Qel-Droma. Together Mandalore and Kun successfully rescued Qel-Droma and returned with him to Yavin 4. Aleema and Qel-Droma were reunited, and although Aleema feigned affection for him once he returned, she was unaware that Mandalore told Qel-Droma of her treachery. Qel-Droma was outwardly unaffected, but secretly he began plotting his revenge.<ref name=\"TSW4\" />\n\n[[File:Aleemadeath.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Aleema's last moments.]]\n\nQel-Droma proceeded with the plan to [[Battle of Kemplex IX|attack]] the relay station at Kemplex IX, sending Aleema and the Jedi traitor [[Crado]] to personally oversee the mission. The idea was to lure the combined Republic and Jedi fleet out into the [[Cron Cluster/Legends|Cron Cluster]], where it would walk into a trap and be destroyed. Kun then introduced Aleema to the [[Corsair (Derriphan-class)|''Corsair'']], an antiquated Sith warship once commanded by the ancient Dark Lord [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]]. He showed her how to operate the vessel and gave her specific instructions in using the Sith [[Crystal/Legends|crystals]] that powered the ship.<ref name=\"TSW4\" /> These same crystals were used generations ago by Sadow when he eluded the Republic fleet by passing between the [[Binary star/Legends|binary star]] known as the [[Denarii Nova]], and used his Sith magic to agitate solar flares as Republic ships followed. The Republic pursuers were destroyed in the conflagration.<ref name=\"FOTSE\">''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Fall of the Sith Empire]]''</ref>\n\nAfter Kun taught her how to harness the ''Corsair''{{'s}} power, Aleema intended to use Sadow's crystals to rip the core from a nearby [[Star/Legends|star]] and hurl it at the fleet. Aleema and Crado left for Kemplex IX, and the Republic fleet followed just as she had hoped. When the moment was right, Aleema activated the Sith crystal-weapon aboard the ''Corsair'' and tore free the heart of one of the ten stars of the Cron Cluster. The Jedi and Republic ships in pursuit were all destroyed as the solar core was hurtled towards them. Although she succeeded in destroying most of the starships, she failed to fully control the power she wielded, as Qel-Droma had deliberately calculated; Aleema, the betrayer, was now the one betrayed. The liberated solar core ignited the hearts of the surrounding suns and created an intense, multi-star [[Cron Supernova/Legends|supernova]], which engulfed three Auril [[Sector/Legends|sector]] star systems and later the planet [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. Caught in the blaze, Aleema and Crado were killed along with their Jedi pursuers [[Dace Diath]], [[Shoaneb Culu]], and [[Qrrrl Toq]], just as Qel-Droma and Kun had planned. [[Light-year/Legends|Light-years]] away on Yavin 4, both Kun and Qel-Droma felt the [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|disturbance in the Force]] that was the death of Aleema Keto.<ref name=\"TSW4\" />\n\nAleema and Satal's legacy would be realized many thousands of years later in the form of Satal's descendant, [[Sebban Keto]]. Sebban was a Tetan businessman who, like his ancestors, practiced dark side magic and used it to reestablish the Krath traditions on Empress Teta.<ref name=\"BDC\">{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050414planet2|text=Byss and the Deep Core Part 2|int=Byss and the Deep Core|archivedate=20091230032049}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What will we do about their families?''\"<br />\"''Everyone who does not accept our authority should be ''publicly humiliated''.

To this end she was bored with the normal goings-on of high society and sought to amuse herself by dabbling in the lore of Sith magic. She showed quite a thirst for forbidden knowledge and so traveled with her cousin to Onderon solely for the purpose of discovering the mysteries of the Sith. She was na\u00efve to the fact that the dark side had a corrosive nature, and would surely twist and corrupt her.<ref name=\"FNU1\" />\n\nAs a Sith sorceress, Aleema had a penchant for treating individuals as worthless inferiors, often devising cruel punishments for subordinates who tried her patience. She had a short temper, striking out at subordinates with little provocation, using her powers to horrify and terrorize those of her choosing.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" />\n\nAleema was sneaky, cunning, and conniving, often using deception and manipulation to further her goals. She used her womanly wiles to seduce Ulic Qel-Droma, who was already on a path to the dark side, and then further manipulated him into ultimately murdering her cousin.<ref name=\"DOADJ\" /> Aleema then governed the Krath exclusively, and with Qel-Droma by her side she became even more brash and arrogant, fully believing in the strength of her powers. Her dishonesty was further realized when she betrayed Qel-Droma to the Jedi, but when he returned, she resumed her romantic deceptions.<ref name=\"TSW3\" /> Her na\u00efvete was again evident as she was unaware that Mandalore had warned Qel-Droma of her treachery. It would prove her undoing, since Qel-Droma's own deception ultimately ended in Aleema's demise.<ref name=\"TSW4\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|Here is the power to wrench fire from the stars&hellip;Let me show you how to use it, Aleema.''\"<br />\"''Yes! I can sense the Sith power vibrating through the walls.|Exar Kun and Aleema Keto|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Sith War 4}}\n[[File:Aleema'sMagic3.jpg|thumb|right|205px|Aleema, displaying her dark arts.]]\nEven before becoming a Sith witch, Aleema showed a considerable connection to the Force. She endured the strong dark side energies emanating from Onderon, while her cousin Satal was stricken with malaise upon feeling the same power.<ref name=\"FNU2\" /> Aleema also had a propensity for [[Precognition/Legends|precognition]], demonstrated on numerous occasions in which she displayed a vague awareness of how immediate events would unfold. She was able to calm Satal's fear of impending doom while aboard the ''Krath Enchanter'' by assuring him that they were going to survive what seemed like an inevitable crash. When they finally touched down, Aleema instinctively knew that they were in the right place.<ref name=\"FNU2\" /> Her Force sense was also strong, more so than Satal's, since she was able to sense the strong dark side aura emanating from Onderon and the strong dark side presences of both Qel-Droma and Exar Kun.<ref name=\"DOADJ\" />\n\nAfter receiving instruction from both Freedon Nadd and King Ommin, Aleema developed her unique connection with the dark side into a considerable mastery of Sith magic. When performing her magical incantations, an aqua glow of dark side energy shone over her right eye. Her greatest ability was in creating illusions, something she mastered to a high degree. Aleema used Sith magic to conjure apparitions of creatures that seemed alive, but in reality were not.<ref name=\"DOADJ\" /> During the First Battle of Empress Teta, she created mass illusions of space grazers and giant starships, and also used her illusory talents to conceal her cousin's Chaos fighters' assault on the Galactic Republic fleet. The Jedi Knight Nomi Sunrider was on more than one occasion able to pinpoint Aleema as the source of the deception and assaulted her mind directly, an attack Aleema was unprepared for and could not withstand.<ref name=\"DLOTS\" /><ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\nTo amuse herself, Aleema often tortured her lackeys with her magic, turning technology into vile organic perversions or serving guests with platters of severed heads. When [[Sword/Legends|swords]] were raised against her, she brushed off the attack and then turned her adversaries' weapons against them, transforming their blades into snakes. She was also able to project concentrated blasts of pure dark side energy, even without the use of a Sith amulet.<ref name=\"DOADJ\" />\n\nFrom Kun she learned to harness the dark side through Naga Sadow's technology on the ''Corsair'' with her sorcery, and used it to destroy the ten stars of the Cron Cluster. Her overconfidence in this new-found ability was her undoing, just as Qel-Droma foresaw; the ensuing supernovae consumed her as well since she was not able to fully control the dark power of Sadow's vessel.<ref name=\"TSW4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Aleema Keto was first conceived and written by [[Tom Veitch]] and drawn by [[Tony Akins]] for the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] comic series, first appearing in the issue [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 2|''The Freedon Nadd Uprising: Initiates of the Sith'']], published in [[1994]]. However, she was first mentioned in the [[Dark Empire endnotes|''Dark Empire'' endnotes]], a series of short essays that provided back stories for several ''[[Star Wars]]'' topics, including Ulic Qel-Droma and the Krath. The endnotes' mention of the Krath laid the foundation for Keto's involvement in the upcoming ''Tales of the Jedi'' story arcs. For the [[Tales of the Jedi (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi'' audio drama]], Keto was voiced by [[Garet Scott]], and again by [[Jocelyn Blue]] for the [[Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)|''Dark Lords of the Sith'' audio drama]]. Even though her involvement was minimal, Veitch's creation of Aleema Keto for the ''Freedon Nadd Uprising'' allowed for the character to be further explored in the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith|''Dark Lords of the Sith'']] and [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Sith War|''The Sith War'']] stories, respectively.
