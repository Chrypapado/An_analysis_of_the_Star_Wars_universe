A champion [[Landspeeder/Legends|speeder]] racer, her partner was almost [[Death/Legends|killed]] in a crash two days before the [[Reproduction/Legends|birth]] of their [[Gender/Legends|son]], [[Thall Joben/Legends|Thall]]. When he later refused to let Thall become a racer himself, Thall stowed aboard a [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] bound for the planet [[Boonta/Legends|Boonta]]. Only upon his father's death, at some point prior to [[15 BBY/Legends|15 BBY]], did Thall return to Beheboth. At the funeral, Thall's mother told him about his father's former career. She died herself a few months later.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{PolyhedronCite|170|Star Wars Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-droids-re-animated-part-1|text=The Droids Re-Animated, Part 1|int=The Droids Re-Animated}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joben, Thall}}\n[[Category:Behebothians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified mothers]]"}}}]}}}}
