Though Owen refused numerous [[time]]s to let Skywalker go when he wished to leave home and join the [[Imperial Academy|Academy]], Lars convinced her husband to let Skywalker go after staying on for only one more season. This decision coincided with the aftermath of the [[Battle of Scarif|theft]] of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[Death Star plans|plans]] and Darth Vader's [[Secret mission to Tatooine|capture]] of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] over Tatooine.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n===Death===\n{{Quote|If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to and that would lead them back&mdash;home.|Luke Skywalker upon realizing his aunt and uncle's imminent danger|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n[[File:Torched_homestead.png|thumb|left|250px|Beru and her husband lay dead at the hands of the Empire.]]\nAround this time, Skywalker and Owen purchased two [[droid]]s from a [[Jawa]] [[sandcrawler]] that stopped by their homestead. These two droids were the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]] and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], who were being hunted by the Empire. Before dinner, Skywalker cleaned the two droids in the garage where he found a message from Organa meant to be received by Kenobi. Skywalker told his aunt and uncle about this recording at the dinner table which prompted discussion about the relationship between Kenobi and Skywalker's [[Parent|father]]. Owen also discussed Skywalker staying another season on the [[farm]], which Lars intervened and tried to reason with her husband that Skywalker shouldn't stay on the farm forever. In this conversation she likened Skywalker with his father, an idea that Owen was not fond of. After dinner Skywalker returned to the garage and found that R2-D2 had fled the homestead. The next morning Skywalker told Lars that he'd had some chores to do and went with C-3PO to look for R2-D2, who was secretly carrying the stolen Death Star plans. A concerned Owen could not find Luke, who was supposed to have the two droid to the south ridge by midday. He spoke to his wife about it, who told him that Skywalker had left early to complete some chores and that he had taken the two droids with him. While Skywalker was away, however,<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[stormtrooper]]s, who were searching for plans located in R2-D2's memory banks, were led to the Lars homestead by Owen's purchase of the droids from the Jawas.

As she speculated that had Owen let Skywalker go, they could be still alive, Lars remembered various moments of her life, finally resting comfortably with the knowledge that Skywalker went off with Kenobi, met Organa, [[Battle of Yavin|destroyed]] the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]] and saved the galaxy.<ref name=\"BWL:FaCPoV\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|I guess it's an irony.
