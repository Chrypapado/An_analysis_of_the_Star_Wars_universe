Why can't you?|Rogua, criticizing [[Gartogg/Legends|Gartogg]]|And Then There Were Some: The Gamorrean Guard's Tale}}\n'''Rogua''' was one of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] nine [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] guards. He took unusual joy in making [[Gartogg/Legends|Gartogg]] miserable.\n\n==Biography==\nAmongst his duties included guarding the main door (with his partner [[Ortugg]]) and escorting prisoners to the cells. He was guarding the main door with Ortugg during the arrival of [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]]. When [[Leia Organa Solo]], disguised as [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]], entered the palace with [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], Ortugg and Rogua escorted the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] to prison. Gartogg followed them, wanting to help, but Ortugg and Rogua sent him away. However, the disappointed Gartogg still followed them.<ref name=\"rotj\" />\n\nLater, when Jabba tried to negotiate with Boushh, Gartogg tried to ask Ortugg and Rogua if he was allowed to go on [[Jabba's sail barge]], but Ortugg said Gartogg must earn the privilege, while Rogua made fun of him for not being able to speak in complete sentences. When Gartogg came to Rogua and Ortugg after discovering [[Phlegmin]]'s corpse and planned to solve the murder, Ortugg said he would allow Gartogg to come on the [[Sail barge/Legends|sail barge]] if the mystery was solved. Later, when [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] arrived at the palace, Rogua and Ortugg attempted to block Luke's way, but were both [[Telekinesis/Legends#Choking powers|Force choked]] by the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and lost consciousness. Rogua was one of the Gamorreans who went on the sail barge with Ortugg during the [[Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon]], where he was killed in the explosion.<ref name=\"rotj\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[And Then There Were Some: The Gamorrean Guard's Tale]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Topps|set=1983 Topps Star Wars: Return of the Jedi Series 1|cardname=Gamorrean Guard|link=https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/72969/cid/5256899/1983-Topps-Return-Of-The-Jedi-49-Gamorrean-Guard|archivedate=20201105144151}}\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*{{StarWarsKidsCite|8|Who Is That Alien?}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Action Figure Archive]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|134|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: An Audience with Jabba the Hutt}}\n*{{InsiderCite|141|A Star Wars Family Legacy}} {{Po}}\n*{{SWMCite|2|Take a Tour of Jabba's Palace!}} {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rogua\n|es=Rogua\n|nl=Rogua\n|pl=Rogua\n|ru=\u0420\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
