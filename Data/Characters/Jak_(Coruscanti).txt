The battle is just starting.|Jak, and Rorak|Aftermath (novel)}}\n'''Jak''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[Coruscanti|individual]] who lived with his [[Parent|father]], [[Rorak (individual)|Rorak]], on the [[planet]] [[Coruscant]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. His father raised him to believe that, one [[Standard day|day]], the [[Galactic Empire]] would fall and [[the galaxy]] would be a better place. Jak was present in [[Monument Plaza]] with his father when Coruscanti citizens toppled a statue of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious]], and [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]] [[Riot in Monument Plaza|rushed]] in to maintain order. Jak was confused, believing that the war had come to an end, but Rorak told him that the real battle had only just begun. During the [[Coruscant civil war]], Jak joined a group of rebellious [[Youngling|youngsters]] known as the [[Anklebiter Brigade]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Imperial_center_ROTJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|As a child, Jak was among the Coruscanti who celebrated in Monument Plaza upon learning of the Emperor's death.]]\nJak and his [[Parent|father]] [[Rorak (individual)|Rorak]] lived on the [[The galaxy|galactic]] [[capital]] [[Coruscant]] during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]]. He was twelve [[Standard year|years]] old at the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]]. After news of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine's]] [[death]] reached Coruscant, Jak and Rorak were part of a crowd that gathered at [[Monument Plaza]] to pull down a statue of the Emperor. The crowd came under attack from several [[Coruscant Security Force]] [[officer]]s on [[Panther police interceptor|police speeders]]. A [[Riot in Monument Plaza|riot]] ensued and the rioters hurled pieces of the statue at [[Law enforcement agency|police]] officers.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nShocked by the riot, Jak told his father that he thought the battle was over and the [[Galactic Empire]]'s end had come. Rorak, who had lived through the [[Clone Wars]], disagreed and told his son that the battle had just started. The two embraced each other and Rorak handed his son a rock. Jak and his father took part in the riot but were forced to flee by the Imperial security forces. Rorak was killed by [[Commander]] [[Orkin Kaw]] and Jak joined a group of young resistance fighters known as the [[Anklebiter Brigade]].<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nDuring the [[Coruscant civil war]], the now thirteen year-old Jak gained an audience with the [[Iktotchi]] [[crime lord]] [[Talvee Chawin]] after rescuing his woman, [[Lazula]] from police custody. He traveled to the seedy [[Level 1313]] of the [[Coruscant Underworld]] where Chawin offered the adolescent a birthday present but warned that it came with a \"price tag.\" In return for obtaining an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] to disable the power grid in [[CoCo Town]], Jak agreed to join his gang. Jak planned to take advantage of the blackout to exact revenge on his father's killer, Orkin Kaw.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJak was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] child at the time of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He would spend his formative years listening to his father's tales of the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict that preceded the war between the Empire and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion]]. Jak was deeply affected by the death of his father, having lost the only family he had. Like his father, Jak disliked both the Emperor and the Empire; when news of the Rebel victory at [[Endor]] reached his [[homeworld]], Jak celebrated Palpatine's death in the streets of [[Imperial City|Galactic City]]. Embittered by his father's death during the riots, Jak began actively opposing the Empire as a member of the Anklebiter [[Brigade]]. He also sought vengeance against Orkin Kaw, the [[Imperial officer]] who killed his father.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJak is a minor point-of-view character who appeared in two interlude chapters on Coruscant in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2015]] novel [[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']] {{1st|[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/chaos-throttles-the-capital-in-star-wars-aftermath-special-excerpt|text=Chaos Throttles the Capital in ''Star Wars: Aftermath'' &ndash; Special Excerpt!}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jak (Coruscanti)#kanon\n|fr=Jak\n|ja=\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0430\u043a (\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0446)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Anklebiter Brigade members]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
