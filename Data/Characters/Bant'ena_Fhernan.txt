While there, the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] invaded the planet, and murdered most of her colleagues and took her captive. She was given to [[Lok Durd/Legends|Lok Durd]], who forced her to create a [[Bioweapon/Legends|bioweapon]] that would turn organic matter to mush. She later met the two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Skywalker promised to free her and to save her loved ones that the Confederacy kept under constant surveillance. Durd found out about the arrangement and threatened her nephews, finally convincing Fhernan to give the two Jedi up to Durd. Although the Jedi, informed by Skywalker and Kenobi of Fhernan and her family, managed to rescue all but one of her friends and family, Fhernan remained unaware of their safety and continued to work for Durd, eventually resulting in a terrorist attack on [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] using her weaponry.\n\nFhernan immediately regretted allowing herself to be controlled by her loved ones, constantly thinking about how many mothers and fathers had been lost on Chandrila to innocent civilians. In the midst of this, the Jedi had sent reinforcements to Skywalker and Kenobi, and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Taria Damsin]] was sent to rescue Fhernan and destroy Durd's compound. Once it was discovered that there would be complications in both setting off the explosives and escaping, Fhernan volunteered to stay behind and set them off herself in an attempt to right all of her wrongs. Damsin agreed, and once she had cleared the area, Fhernan detonated the bombs, killing herself and destroying all of Durd's base.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth]]'' {{1st|[[Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Stealth'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege]]''\n*[[Clone Wars Gambit: Siege (audiobook)|''Clone Wars Gambit: Siege'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'' {{1stp}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bant'ena Fhernan#legends\n|ru=\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0442'\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043d\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fhernan, Bant'ena}}\n[[Category:Confederacy science and engineering personnel]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
