She was one of the Human colonists who had fled a civil war on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] of [[Grizmallt/Legends|Grizmallt]] and established a new civilization on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], a green haven located on the borders of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name=\"SON\" />\n\nWhile her people was engaged in bloody conflict with the native [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]], that woman was chosen to lead the colonists, who took the name of their new [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and became known as \"the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]].\" Although she accepted both the title and the function of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]], that woman refused to be the founder of a hereditary succession line. Instead, the newly elected Queen decreed that her successor would be selected based on their merits only. This started a tradition of meritocratic democracy on Naboo, which would still be used millennia later.<ref name=\"SON\" /> However, the constitution of Naboo had a provision that allowed the monarchy to become hereditary for a worthy dynasty, and this happened at least once in history.<ref name=\"DP\">[[Darth Plagueis/Legends|''Darth Plagueis'']]</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Secrets of Naboo]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box|\n|title=[[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|Monarch of Naboo]]\n|years=c.[[3900 BBY]]\n|before=None\n|after=Eventually [[King/Legends|King]] [[Narml\u00e9]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Monarchs of Naboo]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Unidentified females]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified royalty]]"}}}]}}}}
