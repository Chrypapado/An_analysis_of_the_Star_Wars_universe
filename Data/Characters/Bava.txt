After the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], he was allowed to live on [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]], where he attempted to build a community in [[La'okio]].\n\nIn [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]], Bava took his complaint of Ghator and his fellow ex-[[Warrior caste|warriors]] to one of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Knight]] overseers of Zonama Sekot, [[Tahiri Veila]]. When Ghator told Bava and Veila that nothing would grow in their own section of the village (which went against the post-Yuuzhan Vong War decree that the Yuuzhan Vong were supposed to live in mixed groups) because [[Yun'o]] had disgraced them (which was also supposed to be a discarded belief in the aftermath of the war). Ghator had blamed this on the former [[Jeedai heresy|heretics]] for their downfall by the end of the war. Bava rebutted this argument by reminding Ghator that it was the late [[Supreme Overlord]] [[Shimrra Jamaane]] who almost led the Yuuzhan Vong to ruin via the war with his own heresy and, because of the former warriors' unwillingness to change, it was now the warriors who were the new [[Shamed Ones]], rather than the Extolled. For this, Ghator smacked Bava across the face, something that Tahiri Veila would have been unable to stop even if she wanted; she had wanted to subtly remind Bava that trying to cast the former Yuuzhan Vong warriors as new Shamed Ones was one of their previous society's negative attributes that they needed to move beyond.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bava\n|es=Bava\n|ja=\u30d0\u30f4\u30a1\n|pl=Bava\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sekotans]]\n[[Category:Shamed Ones]]"}}}]}}}}
