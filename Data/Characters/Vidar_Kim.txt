There are things that I know to which even the Jedi aren't privy.|Vidar Kim|Republic 64}}\n'''Vidar Kim''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Politics/Legends|politician]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. Kim served as the [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of the [[Chommell sector/Legends|Chommell sector]] in the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in the [[50 BBY/Legends|50s BBY]], and was the tutor of a young noble boy named [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Unknown to Kim, Palpatine had been recruited as an [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]].\n\nSenator Kim's eldest son, [[Ronhar Kim|Ronhar]], had been identified as [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] and turned over to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] in his infancy, a choice Senator Kim would later regret before his [[Death/Legends|death]]. Kim's politics were conservative and isolationist, and he clashed with politicians like [[Bon Tapalo/Legends|Bon Tapalo]] and [[Ars Veruna/Legends|Ars Veruna]] who wished to open Naboo to [[The galaxy/Legends|the wider galaxy]]. Tragedy struck Kim in [[54 BBY/Legends|54 BBY]] when his wife and two children perished in a [[Starship/Legends|starship]] accident over [[Kaadara]]. Convinced that his political opponents had been behind his family's deaths to force his retirement, Kim's behaviour became increasingly erratic, attempting to lure Ronhar away from the Jedi Order to rejoin him on Naboo. Identifying the Senator as a liability to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Grand Plan/Legends|Grand Plan]], at the behest of Darth Plagueis Palpatine arranged Kim's assassination in [[52 BBY/Legends|52 BBY]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], the capital world of the [[Chommell sector/Legends|Chommell sector]], Vidar Kim first tasted [[Politics/Legends|politics]] during his required [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of service in the [[Legislative Youth Program/Legends|Legislative Youth Program]]. Becoming the administrative [[Aide/Legends|aide]] of a [[Unidentified female Naboo senator|young female Senator]], Kim slowly began his ascent through Naboo politics.<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\nAt some point, Kim met his [[Vidar Kim's wife|wife]], and was happily [[Marriage/Legends|married]] to her for years, fathering three sons, including a [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] boy named [[Ronhar Kim]]. When the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] approached the family, Kim and his wife parted ways with little Ronhar, sending him to the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to be [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|initiated]] in the ways of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\nAs a conservative [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]], Kim garnered the support of [[Imperial family|House Palpatine's]] patriarch, [[Cosinga Palpatine]], as both men shared a pro-isolationist stance. Discouraging the bedding of corporate entities who wanted to exploit the rich [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]] reserves in the planet's core, Kim did all he could to persuade the [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|monarchy]] and the [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] to avoid selling their rare resource offworld. As Kim finished his [[Time/Legends|time]] at the [[Apprentice Legislator/Legends|Apprentice Legislator]] program, he met the eldest son of his supporter, a young boy by the name of [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]; Kim took the rebellious youth under his wing and tutored him during his time in the Youth Program. Despite the fact that Palpatine&mdash;a strong supporter of Naboo's opening to [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]&mdash;and his mentor had vastly different political viewpoints, they got along well and were close friends. Vidar once told Palpatine that he was like the younger brother that he had never had.<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\n===Senator of the Chommell sector===\nKim's conservative politics and influential backers eventually saw him succeed the outgoing Senator as the Chommell sector's representative in the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]]. Kim's isolationist stance saw him clash with [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|King]] [[Bon Tapalo/Legends|Bon Tapalo]] over the sale of Naboo's [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]] reserves: Tapalo had arranged a deal with the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] to export Naboo's plasma through it, and Kim saw the deal as unjust and exploitative, pointing out that the Federation sold the plasma on for up to twenty times the price it paid for it. Kim came to feel that he was only kept on as Senator to placate the [[Noble/Legends|noble houses]] of Naboo that had opposed Tapalo in the election of [[65 BBY/Legends|65 BBY]].<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\nBy [[54 BBY/Legends|54 BBY]], Senator Kim was joined in the Senate by his pupil, now [[Ambassador/Legends|ambassador]], Palpatine and [[Kinman Doriana]]. Unknown to Kim, Palpatine had been taken as the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]]. The [[Muun/Legends|Muun]] [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] had ordered Palpatine to deepen his connection to Kim upon hearing that the Senator had sired a Forceful son. Plagueis thought to turn the boy to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] at a future date if it would help further the [[Grand Plan/Legends|Grand Plan]]. Both Kim and Palpatine knew that the younger man would one [[Standard day/Legends|day]] replace him in the Senate, and that Kim only continued to serve in the position to appeal to the opponents of the current [[King/Legends|King]] [[Bon Tapalo/Legends|Bon Tapalo]]. During a gala on [[Malastare/Legends|Malastare]] in the wake of the [[Vinta Harvest Classic/Legends|Vinta Harvest Classic]], Senator Kim and his entourage were in attendance when the Senator received a communiqu\u00e9 from Naboo, revealing the [[Death/Legends|death]] of his entire family in a [[Airspeeder/Legends|airspeeder]] accident over [[Kaadara]].<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\nReturning immediately to Naboo, Kim, his entourage and a large throng of mourners gathered at the [[Theed Funeral Temple|Funeral Temple]] in [[Theed/Legends|Theed]] for his family's [[Cremation/Legends|cremation]]. The [[Funeral/Legends|funeral]] procession was led by King Tapalo into the Temple, where the three bodies were laid upon a massive pyre and reduced to ashes. Walking on foot to the nearby [[Livet Tower/Legends|Livet Tower]], Senator Kim reflected in silence around the [[Eternal Flame]] before giving an emotional farewell to his family, spreading their ashes into the [[Solleu River/Legends|Solleu River]] and over the [[Virdugo Plunge/Legends|Virdugo Plunge]].<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\n===Death===\nBroken by the tragedy, Kim devised a far-fetched plot to lead his only living son, the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] Ronhar Kim, away from the Order and to carry on the family lineage. Returning to Coruscant within a [[Standard month/Legends|month]] of his family's accident, Kim was angered when his only remaining son refused him, reaffirming his oath to the Jedi Order. Two years passed without further communication between the Kims, though the whole affair weighed heavily on the Senator. In [[52 BBY/Legends|52 BBY]], Kim called upon Palpatine to discuss matters of great import at his home in Theed. Detailing his belief that the King and his adviser, [[Ars Veruna/Legends|Ars Veruna]], had arranged the crash to kill his family as a means to make him retire, Kim outlined his plan to reveal the King's corruption to the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]]. While on Coruscant, Kim had arranged a meeting with his son with the intention of swaying him to his cause and getting him to investigate on Naboo.<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\nAs Kim began to become frantic, the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] working behind the scenes on Naboo came to the conclusion that the Senator had become too much of a liability. Sidious, the alter-ego of Ambassador Palpatine, arranged with [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]] to have Kim [[Assassin/Legends|killed]] on Coruscant by a [[Unidentified female Maladian assassin|Maladian assassin]].<ref name=\"SWDP\" /> A [[Standard week/Legends|week]] later, Kim was riding in an [[Vidar Kim's airspeeder|open-air speeder]] with his last remaining heir when the hired assassin fired a round at the car, killing Kim before committing [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] to evade capture and interrogation by the Jedi.<ref name=\"SWR64\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Vidar_Kim_Dead.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The funeral of Vidar Kim]]\nThe funeral service for Senator Kim was held at the [[Naboo Embassy]] on Coruscant, and was attended by interim Senator and Kim's old friend, Palpatine. The secret Sith Lord used the funeral to meet with Kim's son, Ronhar Kim, the first Jedi he had ever encountered. Approaching Kim in the viewing room, Palpatine spoke with the Jedi about forming an alliance as the corpse of Senator Kim lay nearby in silence; a bowl of [[Color/Legends|purple]] [[Flower/Legends|flowers]] rested on his chest, along with a symbolic [[Candle/Legends|candle]] representing the Eternal Flame. Agreeing to the terms, Palpatine and Jedi Kim would form a close relationship as the Sith Lord sought to undo the Republic.<ref name=\"SWDP\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]\n*[[Darth Plagueis (audiobook)|''Darth Plagueis'' audiobook]]\n*[[Republic 64|''Republic'' 64]] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of the [[Chommell sector/Legends|Chommell sector]]\n|years=&mdash;[[52 BBY/Legends|52 BBY]]\n|before=[[Unidentified female Naboo senator]]\n|before-years=\n|after=[[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]\n|after-years=[[52 BBY/Legends|52]]&ndash;[[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]]}}\n{{End_box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Vidar Kim}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vidar Kim\n|es=Vidar Kim\n|hu=Vidar Kim\n|pl=Vidar Kim\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041a\u0438\u043c\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kim, Vidar}}\n[[Category:Galactic Republic senators]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
