He was instructed to spy on Jabba's accountant [[Tessek/Legends|Tessek]], due to Jabba's growing suspicions about him. During one night he interrupted [[Dannik Jerriko]] when he tried to feed on the soup of [[Yarna d'al' Gargan/Legends|Yarna d'al' Gargan]].\n\nHe and Rogua were present when [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] entered the palace, and the pair were later [[Telekinesis/Legends#Choking powers|Force choked]] by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] when they attempted to block his entrance. He was one of the guards who laughed at [[Jubnuk/Legends|Jubnuk]] as he lay helpless in the eyes of the [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]]. He was killed when Jabba's sail barge, the [[Khetanna/Legends|''Khetanna'']], blew up.<ref name=\"rotj\" />\n\n[[Venorra]] was member of the same Gamorrean clan as Ortugg.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe ''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]'' said Ortugg remained behind at the palace when Jabba died at the [[Sarlacc/Legends|sarlacc]] pit, still waiting for their master and driving off all intruders. This contradicts the evidence of the movie and other sources, though some Gamorreans may have continued to guard the palace afterwards.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi|story=The Employment Test}} {{Mo}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|text=''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi'', Second Edition|story=The Employment Test}} {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Return of the Jedi 1|''Return of the Jedi'' 1]]\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Star Wars Sourcebook|story=A Rancor Comes to Tatooine}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Star Wars Sourcebook (Second Edition)|text=''Star Wars Sourcebook'', Second Edition|story=A Rancor Comes to Tatooine}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Star Wars Sourcebook|story=Ortugg's Letter Home}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Star Wars Sourcebook (Second Edition)|text=''Star Wars Sourcebook'', Second Edition|story=Ortugg's Letter Home}}\n*{{Shortstory|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace|story=A Boy and His Monster: The Rancor Keeper's Tale}} {{1stID|Captain Ortugg}}\n*{{Shortstory|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace|story=Taster's Choice: The Tale of Jabba's Chef}}\n*{{Shortstory|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace|story=And Then There Were Some: The Gamorrean Guard's Tale}}\n*{{Shortstory|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace|story=A Free Quarren in the Palace: Tessek's Tale}}\n*{{Shortstory|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace|story=Skin Deep: The Fat Dancer's Tale}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Shortstory|book=Tales from Jabba's Palace|story=Epilogue: Whatever Became Of...?}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi'', Second Edition]]\n*{{StarWarsKidsCite|8|Who Is That Alien?}}\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology]]''\n*{{CCG|set=Jabba's Palace Limited|link=JabbasPalace-Light/large/choke.gif|cardname=Choke}}\n*{{CCG|set=Jabba's Palace Limited|link=JabbasPalace-Dark/large/ortugg.gif|cardname=Ortugg}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Action Figure Archive]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Secrets of Tatooine]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|60|Who's Who in Jabba's Palace}}\n*{{FFCite|2|GAM3, ''Gamorreans''}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050106a|text=Fringe Benefits|int=Fringe Benefits|archivedate=20090603070442}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Rebellion Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|134|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: An Audience with Jabba the Hutt}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|141|A Star Wars Family Legacy}} {{Po}}\n*{{SW|url=news/barely-tolerable-alien-henchmen-of-the-empire-part-2|text=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2|int=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire}}\n*{{SWMCite|2|Take a Tour of Jabba's Palace!}} {{Po}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ortugg#legends\n|es=Ortugg\n|ko=\uc624\ub974\ud22c\uadf8\n|nl=Ortugg\n|pt=Ortugg\n|ru=\u041e\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0433\u0433\n}}\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Gamorreans]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
