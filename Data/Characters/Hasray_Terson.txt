His [[Parent/Legends|parents]], [[Adray Terson|Adray]] and [[Hasville Terson]], were the owners of the [[Terson Comfort Carriers]] [[Air taxi/Legends|air taxi]] company on the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], as well as the [[Starship/Legends|starship]], ''[[Ugly Truth]]''. When the former [[Senator/Legends|senator]] and [[Yuuzhan Vong]] collaborator [[Viqi Shesh]] was helping the Yuuzhan Vong [[Denua Ku]] and [[Raglath Nur]] hunt [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] on Coruscant during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War|Yuuzhan Vong's invasion]] of the galaxy in [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]], Shesh spotted Terson hiding from the invaders. He was floating in a pool of liquid with [[Death/Legends|dead]] bodies, but since he was alive, his body was not bloated like the rest. Denua Ku instructed Shesh to question Terson, but when the hunting party's [[voxyn]] got agitated, Ku snapped Terson's neck. Before his death, however, Terson gave Shesh a remote to access his [[Terson family|family's]] ship.<ref name=\"ELII: RS\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHasray Terson was created for ''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]'', which was written by [[Aaron Allston]] and released on [[May 28]], [[2002]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Terson, Hasray}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
