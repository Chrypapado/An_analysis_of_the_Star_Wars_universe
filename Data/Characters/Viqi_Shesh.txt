On the day of our victory, your reward will be beyond imagining.|Tsavong Lah|The New Jedi Order: Star by Star}}\n'''Viqi Shesh''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] politician from the [[Kuat system/Legends|Kuat system]] who attained [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] infamy due to her collaboration with the invading [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Species/Legends|species]] during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. Obsessed with power, Shesh rose to prominence as the [[Senator/Legends|representative]] of [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]] in the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]]. When the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] in [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]] and inflicted heavy defeats upon the government and the [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|military]], Shesh soon decided that her best chances of survival lay with the winning side. Over a two year period, the Kuati senator passed vital information and military intelligence to Yuuzhan Vong spymasters with the intention of encouraging the invaders to spare Kuat and provide her with a position of power in their administration.\n\nA skilled politician, Shesh managed to secure herself the position of administrative senator for the [[Senate Select Committee for Refugees]], whereupon she channeled millions of displaced persons to [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] she knew would be targeted by the Yuuzhan Vong, such as the planet [[Duro/Legends|Duro]]. When [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]], the military leader of the Yuuzhan Vong, came to spearhead the invasion, Shesh maintained personal contact with the fierce [[Warrior caste|warrior]], unaware that she was being used and was ultimately intended to be discarded. A vocal opponent of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]], Shesh aided the warmaster in his vendetta against the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] by pushing for their [[Peace Vote|exile]] from the New Republic and championing the betrayal of the Order to the invaders in return for peace.\n\nThe full extent of the Kuati woman's collaboration with the Yuuzhan Vong went undiscovered and, although the suspicions of her colleague [[Leia Organa Solo]] led to Shesh's loss of her seat on the refugee committee, she remained prominent in the Senate, presenting herself as a rival to [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] [[Borsk Fey'lya]]. Warmaster Lah later promised Shesh the position of puppet Chief of State with the proviso that she arrange the assassination of Fey'lya. Shesh's attempt failed and she was soon thwarted in her efforts to divide the New Republic Senate by Luke Skywalker, who formed an alliance with Fey'lya and the New Republic military in opposition to her [[Anti-Jedi sentiment/Legends|anti-Jedi]] policies.\n\nThe Kuati politician was forced to turn to espionage and abduction to prove her worth to Tsavong Lah, becoming increasingly distanced from her life as a high profile senator. Under Lah's orders, Shesh targeted [[Han Solo/Legends|Han]] and Leia Organa Solo, as well as their nephew [[Ben Skywalker]]. A bungled attack on the Solo residence, however, resulted in the revelation of Shesh's identity as a Yuuzhan Vong spy to the New Republic and the Kuati politician was sent fleeing into [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant's]] underbelly. In a last gamble to appease the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh attempted to kidnap Ben Skywalker while the warmaster's armada [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|attacked]] and conquered Coruscant in [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]].\n\nShesh was foiled in her scheme shortly thereafter and was left with little choice but to present herself to the Yuuzhan Vong empty handed. Openly known as a traitor to the New Republic, Shesh was of no further use to Tsavong Lah and was sentenced to execution by the warmaster. Providing the warrior with advice in return for her continued survival, Shesh spent a short time acting as Lah's spymaster, directing Yuuzhan Vong agent [[Tam Elgrin]] to spy on a New Republic base on the planet [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]] before being dispatched to the ruined surface of Coruscant to hunt down Jedi alongside a team of Yuuzhan Vong warriors.\n\nThe former senator spent the last days of her life clinging to survival, alternately pursued by a deranged [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] or monitored by Yuuzhan Vong warriors assigned to ensure her obedience to Tsavong Lah's directives. Traveling across Coruscant's despoiled cityscape in search for a means of escape, Shesh's chances were further complicated by the arrival of Luke and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]], along with a New Republic [[Wraith Squadron|insertion team]]. When she was finally outmaneuvered and confronted by her numerous enemies, Viqi Shesh chose to commit [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]], plummeting to her [[Death/Legends|death]] in the shadows of Coruscanti buildings that she had helped to topple.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rise to power===\n{{Quote|Politics is a practical profession.

Their heavy involvement with the shipbuilding industry brought tribulation, however, when the head of Kuat Drive Yards, [[Kuat of Kuat]], committed [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"negtc\" /> destroying 20% of the planet's orbital [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyards]] in the process.<ref name=\"hm\">''[[Hard Merchandise]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the subsequent reconstruction efforts, Shesh's family lost social and political status and turned to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], secretly forging ties with the new government,<ref name=\"negtc\" /> which installed itself on Coruscant in [[6 ABY/Legends|6.5 ABY]]. By the time the New Republic wrested Kuat and its shipyards from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] in [[8 ABY/Legends|8.5 ABY]],<ref name=\"nec\" /> the Shesh family's secret betrayal of Imperial interests reaped vast dividends. Deluged with offers from eager clients affiliated with the New Republic, the Shesh family became accustomed to contracts worth upwards of a billion [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. The young Viqi Shesh was able to find a job in Kuati corporate marketing and, despite her indifference toward the work, learned much about society and how beings could be manipulated by their fears and hopes. Ultimately, however, Shesh's apathy with her corporate post encouraged her to seek a career in the public sector. She desired power and influence and had the ambition and resources to attain both.<ref name=\"negtc\" />\n\nIn [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]],<ref name=\"negtc\" /> Shesh began a political campaign to become elected to the [[New Republic Senate/Legends|New Republic Senate]] as the representative of Kuat,<ref name=\"ff108\" /> utilizing her family's wealth for funds.<ref name=\"negtc\" /><ref name=\"ff108\" /> Shesh's inexperience as a [[Senator/Legends|senator]], rather than being viewed as a weakness, was taken up by the media as a sign that the Kuati woman was a new breed of politician who could breathe life into the New Republic's political system.<ref name=\"negtc\" /> Prominent at Shesh's side was [[Staff Chief]] [[Victor Pomt]], who aided the senator in day to day life as her aide, keeping track of her schedule and helping to arrange her political appointments.<ref name=\"mafr\">''[[Making a Full Recovery]]''</ref>\n\nBy [[23 ABY/Legends|23 ABY]], four years after Shesh entered [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] politics, the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] politician [[Borsk Fey'lya]] had won the election to the position of [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]], replacing the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Leia Organa Solo]].<ref name=\"negtc\" /> [[25 ABY/Legends|Two years later]], Shesh had manipulated the media into portraying her as a fair-minded, just and caring woman,<ref name=\"ff108\" /> largely due to her encouragement of broad coverage of her efforts on the behalf of refugees. Countless new stories arose of which Shesh was the subject,<ref name=\"aoc1\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref> mostly concerning her economic patronage of impoverished worlds and her concern for the less fortunate citizens of the galaxy.<ref name=\"aoc2\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''</ref>\n\nAlong with a seat on the [[Security and Intelligence Council]],<ref name=\"aoc1\" /> Shesh was also closely tied with the running of the [[Coruscant Planetary Defense Force]].<ref name=\"njosb\">''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''</ref> The Kuati senator also had a seat on the [[Senate Select Committee for Refugees]] (SELCORE),<ref name=\"negtc\" /> although Shesh was not known within SELCORE circles for providing much in the way of aid.<ref name=\"aoc2\" /> Nevertheless, the senator from Kuat was considered the rising star of the New Republic<ref name=\"negtc\" /> and due to the vast media attention paid to her, Shesh became almost as well known as Chief of State Fey'lya himself.<ref name=\"aoc1\" /> For her part, Shesh remained amused that she had cultivated an image so far removed from her true desire to attain power at any cost.<ref name=\"aoc2\" />\n\n===Choosing loyalties===\n{{Quote|The New Republic is going to lose this war, and there's nothing to be gained by being on the losing side.|Viqi Shesh|The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial}}\nIn 25 ABY, Shesh was present at a convocation of the New Republic at which former Chief of State Leia Organa Solo, acting as an envoy from the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] world of [[Dubrillion/Legends|Dubrillion]], delivered a report which claimed that a hitherto unknown [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Species/Legends|species]] had launched an extragalactic [[Yuuzhan Vong War|invasion]]. Despite Organa Solo's willingness to provide evidence of the invasion and her vocal statements concerning the danger faced by the New Republic, a bloc of non-Human senators, including the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] [[Pwoe]] and the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] [[Niuk Niuv]], ridiculed the former Chief of State for what they assumed was an attempt to regain political notability. Little support was provided by Chief of State Fey'lya, who was highly dubious of Organa Solo's claims that this unknown species utilized advanced biotechnology. With [[Caamasi]] senator [[Elegos A'Kla]] acting as Organa Solo's only supporter, Shesh watched as the Human woman left the [[Senate Hall|chamber]] in disgust. Contrary to what Pwoe and Niuv believed, Organa Solo was not making a bid for power; the threat of the alien [[Yuuzhan Vong]] was real. This fact only became obvious over the next months, as a host of planets in the Outer Rim Territories were lost to the seemingly relentless advance of the [[Yuuzhan Vong fleet]].<ref name=\"dt1\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]''</ref> The greatest shock came with the [[Battle of Ithor|destruction]] of [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]], a well-known planet on the edge of the [[Mid Rim]].<ref name=\"dt2\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref>\n\nSenator Shesh began to take stock of the situation as she observed the New Republic slowly mobilizing itself to take action against the invaders. Despite the New Republic's ratification of the [[Universal Conscription Bill]] and the galvanizing of, among others, the Kuat shipyards, Fey'lya's government appeared unprepared. [[Anti-Jedi sentiment/Legends|Anti-Jedi]] sentiment was rife, as [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]] were often blamed for taking matters into their own hands, and rumors circulated of a rogue Bothan [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]], [[Traest Kre'fey]], who operated with impunity and without Senate guidance. Shesh soon came to the conclusion that the New Republic would lose the war and that if this happened, she would lose everything she had fought to gain.\n\nThe Kuati woman began to look toward alternative means of holding power. As one of the six members of the Security and Intelligence Council, Shesh had access to a wealth of knowledge on the New Republic's defense capabilities, from the strength of [[Planetary shield/Legends|planetary shields]] and the disposition of fleets to the top secret workings of [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]].<ref name=\"njosb\" /> The Kuati politician also remained prominent in the New Republic Senate, paying heed to the progress of the invasion and deciding on her course of action.<ref name=\"aoc1\" />\n\nFollowing the [[First Battle of Obroa-skai|fall]] of the library world [[Obroa-skai/Legends|Obroa-skai]], [[Bel-dar-Nolek]], [[Director/Legends|Director]] of the [[Obroan Institute for Archaeology|Obroan Institute]], traveled to Coruscant to address the Senate in the [[Grand Convocation Chamber]]. The irate director made vocal condemnations of Fey'lya's handling of the war, claiming that the [[New Republic Defense Fleet/Legends|New Republic Defense Fleet]] was not being deployed to protect worlds such as Obroa-skai and that instead the government was defending the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]]. While [[Sergeant at Arms]] [[Mif Kumas]] attempted to keep order, Shesh saw her opening for publicity and intervened in the discussion. She reminded Bel-dar-Nolek that a wealth of cultural documents had been saved from libraries of Obroa-skai and that the Defense Fleet was maximizing its defense of strategically important worlds.\n\nBel-dar-Nolek refused to be mollified and spoke of a separate peace with the Yuuzhan Vong before turning to anti-Jediism and blaming Skywalker's Order for exacerbating the conflict with the extragalactic invaders. As Fey'lya and Bel-dar-Nolek argued angrily, Shesh decided to make her move, delivering a short address on the importance of unity and solidarity, vocally lending her support to the Jedi. In this way, Shesh gained political credibility and trust, inveigling her way further into the confidence of Fey'lya and the public. All the while, however, she was keeping an eye out for opportunities. Before long, news was received that a Yuuzhan Vong defector, a [[Priest caste|priestess]] known as [[Elan]], had been taken into New Republic custody following a skirmish in the [[Meridian sector/Legends|Meridian sector]].<ref name=\"aoc1\" />\n\nElan was transported to [[Wayland]], a little-known New Republic world that was nevertheless soon attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong in an attempt to retrieve Elan from the hands of New Republic Intelligence. A meeting of the Security and Intelligence Council was called in order to discuss the defection and how Elan and her [[Vergere|companion]] could be returned to Coruscant for debriefing. New Republic Intelligence Operative [[Belindi Kalenda]] delivered a report on the attack on Wayland; the senator paid careful attention to details. Elan was at that time located on [[Myrkr/Legends|Myrkr]], where NRI operatives were preparing to transport her to Coruscant. The route to be taken was from Myrkr to [[Bilbringi system|Bilbringi]], thence to [[Jagga II]], [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]] and finally to the galactic capital. More importantly to Shesh, Kalenda spoke of an organization known as the [[Peace Brigade]] that was pursuing a collaborative relationship with the invaders. The senator saw a possible opportunity to approach the Yuuzhan Vong through this medium and asked whether NRI was observing the group closely. The files on the Peace Brigade and one of its leaders, the [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] [[Reck Desh]], were made available to Shesh. As the meeting continued, Shesh asked Kalenda what the defector wanted in return for the information she carried; the NRI operative informed the council that Elan had asked for a meeting with the Jedi.<ref name=\"aoc1\" />\n\nLuke Skywalker, who was present at the meeting along with his nephew [[Anakin Solo]], was interested by the notion; when Kalenda informed Shesh and her fellow council-members that Elan had provided information on the Yuuzhan Vong fleet's next target, [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]], the senator became convinced that by facilitating Elan's return to the Yuuzhan Vong through the medium of the Peace Brigade, she could initiate her plan to open contact with the invaders. Once the Yuuzhan Vong [[Battle of Ord Mantell (Yuuzhan Vong War)|attacked]] Ord Mantell and were repulsed by New Republic forces, Shesh decided to contact Reck Desh and inform the Peace Brigade of Elan's impending transfer to Coruscant.\n\nBefore she took the step of contacting Desh, Shesh had the New Republic Intelligence's network [[Slicer/Legends|sliced]] into and made sure that surveillance on the Peace Brigade was discontinued. The senator then contacted Desh via [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] anonymously, requesting that the collaborator travel to [[Kuat City]] and meet with someone who could furnish the Peace Brigade with vital information. The location of the meeting was to be the [[Nebula Orchid]], a popular Kuat diner with several private booths.<ref name=\"aoc1\" /> Equipped with an expensive [[Voice disguiser|voice scrambler]] and disguised as a Kuati [[telbun]], Shesh waited for the ex-smuggler to arrive, keeping a cautious eye on her surroundings.<ref name=\"njosb\" /> The eatery was bustling and, as Shesh had made certain, similarly attired telbuns were all around, enabling her to vanish into the crowd should the need arise.<ref name=\"aoc1\" />\n\nSeating herself in booth seven, the senator waited until Desh had sat down in booth six before revealing that she was his contact and telling him to order the two associates he had arrived with to stand down. Desh was cautious and demanded knowledge of the senator's true allegiance, identity and purpose, but Shesh was not forthcoming. She informed the collaborator of Elan and that the Yuuzhan Vong would doubtlessly pay a high price to see the defector returned. In return for the information, Shesh asked her new contact in the Peace Brigade to keep her apprised of any of the organizations dealing with the Yuuzhan Vong. Having passed over the top secret information concerning the route by which Elan was scheduled to be transported and explained her motives for doing so, Shesh warned the ex-smuggler to refrain from passing on knowledge of the meeting even to the Yuuzhan Vong. With that, the senator left the diner and walked out into a courtyard filled with identically clad telbuns, easily throwing off Desh's attempt to follow her.<ref name=\"aoc1\" />\nConfident that she had taken the first steps towards a possible collaborative relationship with the invaders, Shesh returned to her duties as a senator. Before long, Desh and his cohorts acted upon her information and [[Battle of Bilbringi (Yuuzhan Vong War)|attacked]] the ''[[Queen of Empire]]'', the [[Passenger liner/Legends|passenger liner]] transporting Elan, on the outskirts of the [[Bilbringi system]].<ref name=\"aoc1\" />\n[[File:YuuzhanVongUAA.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Two Yuuzhan Vong, members of the species that invaded the New Republic in 25 ABY.]]\n\nThe true nature of the defector, however, was something for which Shesh could not have accounted. Elan was in fact an [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]], dispatched as a false defector to eliminate members of the Jedi Order. The entire scheme, the defeat in the Meridian sector and the losses at Ord Mantell, had all been a ploy to lend Elan's defection credibility. This was proven during the Battle of Bilbringi, during which NRI learned, as did Senator Shesh, that the Yuuzhan Vong vessels had not attempted to retrieve Elan. Nevertheless, Shesh's actions had not gone unnoticed by the Yuuzhan Vong, while on the New Republic end, Desh's [[Death/Legends|death]] during the battle at Bilbringi and Shesh's earlier precautions in contacting the Peace Brigade meant that the senator's involvement went undiscovered.<ref name=\"aoc1\" /> Despite the failure of her plan, Shesh's attempts to send out tentative feelers to the Yuuzhan Vong were far from finished.<ref name=\"aoc2\" /> Due to her prominence in the Senate and her parlaying of Kuat's wartime importance,<ref name=\"sbs\" /><ref name=\"aoc1\" /> she was elected onto Borsk Fey'lya's Advisory Council.\n\nThe Chief of State came under fire for appointing Shesh, as elements of the media felt that their favorite young Kuati senator would become Fey'lya's corrupt stooge and that she had been elected due to the Bothan's desire to keep Kuat on his side. Shesh took the Advisory Council position, along with a spacious office overlooking [[Commerce Way (Coruscant)|Commerce Way]] and the [[New Republic Obelisk]], as it enabled her to provide further aid to the invaders. It soon emerged that the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] race, a species traditionally known for its amorality and criminality, had forged a separate peace with the invaders, exchanging Yuuzhan Vong access to their [[Hutt Space/Legends|territories]] for amnesty. The Yuuzhan Vong [[Battle of Gyndine|struck]] at [[Gyndine/Legends|Gyndine]] from their new holdings in Hutt Space, causing further panic and prompting the question as to which [[Star system/Legends|system]] would be the next target. Shesh observed the progress of the war, paying particular attention to the rearming of [[Centerpoint Station]], an ancient [[Space station/Legends|space station]] in the [[Corellian system]] with vast destructive capabilities.<ref name=\"aoc2\" />\n\n===Communicating through conflict===\n{{Quote|Senator Shesh, there's a Pedric Cuf here to see you. He admits to not having an appointment, but he claims that you have been trying to contact him for the past few months.|Viqi Shesh's secretary announces the arrival of Nom Anor|The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse}}\nWhile arranging the decoration of her new office, the senator received a visit from [[Commodore/Legends|Commodore]] [[Turk Brand|Brand]] of the New Republic Defense Force. The Defense Force wished to entice the Yuuzhan Vong to send a fleet to attack the Corellian system, whereupon the invaders could be trapped and routed. In order to do so, Brand and his superiors needed [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] to appear undefended, a falsehood to which they hoped to lend credibility by encouraging the Advisory Council to direct fleets to protect the [[Bothan sector]], among other worlds. Shesh cottoned on rapidly; she was being asked to tip the Advisory Council vote towards sending the fleets to protect [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]], leaving Corellia apparently under-defended and ripe for a Yuuzhan Vong attack. The senator also realized that she was being offered an opportunity to forewarn the Yuuzhan Vong and essentially save the invaders an entire fleet.\n\nFeigning allegiance to Brand's scheme, she not only promised to swing the vote towards Bothawui, but also claimed that she would visit [[Consul-General]] [[Golga Besadii Fir]], a Hutt politician still present on Coruscant, and inform him that the Yuuzhan Vong would benefit from an attack on Corellia. Shesh and Brand agreed that the consul general, whose Hutt masters were in league with the Yuuzhan Vong, would then inform the invaders. Ostensibly, Shesh's visit to Golga Besadii Fir was therefore in the interests of the New Republic Defense Force and its scheme. In reality, Shesh intended to use the consul general as an intermediary by which she could communicate her collaborationist intentions to the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"aoc2\" />\n\nMeanwhile in the military theater, the [[Inner Rim]] world of [[Tynna/Legends|Tynna]] [[Battle of Tynna|fell]] to the Yuuzhan Vong, following the suspension of Hutt [[Spice/Legends|spice]] deliveries to the [[Tynnani system]]. The NRDF leadership believed that the next system to which the Hutts suspended spice deliveries would be the target and, when Bothawui and Corellia both exhibited evidence that the spice trade had slowed, Brand and his cohorts realized that the time to lure the Yuuzhan Vong to Corellia had come. Shesh traveled to the Hutt consulate, located in the penthouse of the [[Valorum Tower]], and asked to meet with Golga, who granted her an audience despite his imminent departure for Hutt Space. Discussing the treaty that the Hutts and the Yuuzhan Vong had made, Shesh became convinced that she could use Golga, who was a relative of the Hutt leader [[Borga Besadii Diori]], as a means by which she could contact the invaders. As the consul general was essentially being hounded off Coruscant by an irate New Republic government and its citizens, Shesh saw no harm in informing him that the Defense Force wished to lure the Yuuzhan Vong to Corellia in order to destroy them with a reactivated Centerpoint Station. She asked him to deliver this information to Borga the Hutt, whom she hoped would in turn communicate with the Yuuzhan Vong, along with a message that she was \"righting an earlier wrong\"&mdash; a tacit reference to the Elan affair. The Hutt realized that the senator intended to provide information to the Yuuzhan Vong and asked Shesh if this was the case. The Kuati woman easily dodged the question and left the consulate, reporting to Brand that her meeting had gone well.<ref name=\"aoc2\" />\n\nUnfortunately for Shesh's designs, she had not made her message for the Yuuzhan Vong detailed enough with regards to Centerpoint Station. Her information was received, but the full extent of the ancient construct's destructive capabilities remained unknown to the Yuuzhan Vong, who were in any case intending to attack neither Corellia nor Bothawui, having instead set their sights on the [[Fondor Shipyards/Legends|shipyards]] at [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]]. Shesh, the Hutts and the New Republic remained ignorant of this fact, however, and the Kuati senator prepared to play her role as the meeting of the Advisory Council was convened in order to discuss the redisposition of the Defense Force fleets. Shesh traveled to the evening meeting several days later to hear Brand's report along with the other members of the Advisory Council. Chief of State Fey'lya was openly skeptical and dismissive of Brand's opinion that the fluctuations in the Hutt spice trade signified anything of importance.\n\nAs the Defense Force Commodore broached the subject of fleet redisposition and called for a task force to be put together to defend the Corellian system, Fey'lya became outraged, just as Brand and Shesh had predicted, and accused the Defense Force of abandoning Bothawui and trusting poor intelligence. Before long, Fey'lya was railing against Jedi involvement; Shesh watched as [[Fyor Rodan]] of [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]] and Niuk Niuv of [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]] sided with the Chief of State on behalf of Bothawui, motivated mainly by anti-Jedi sentiment. Arrayed against Fey'lya's bloc were [[Chelch Dravvad]] of Corellia, the [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Cal Omas]] and the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Triebakk]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. As the matter of which world should be defended was put to the vote, the two blocs voted for Bothawui and Corellia respectively.<ref name=\"aoc2\" />\n\nQuarren councilor Pwoe, hostile to the Bothan shipbuilding industry and the competition it posed to [[Dac]]'s own [[Mon Calamari Shipyards/Legends|shipyards]], voted for Corellia's defense, while the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Navik]] lent his support to Bothawui due to [[Rodia/Legends|Rodia's]] proximity to the Bothan sector. As there were nine councilors, it fell to Shesh to deliver the deciding vote. True to her promise to Brand, Shesh tipped the vote to Bothawui's favor and Fey'lya promptly ordered Brand's task force to be dispatched to defend the sector, leaving Corellia undefended as planned. Shesh had succeeded, therefore, in gaining allies among Fey'lya and his bloc, the New Republic Defense Force and the Yuuzhan Vong in one move. The fruits of Shesh's labors revealed themselves over the next few days but, as with Elan, she had once again misjudged Yuuzhan Vong designs. The invaders ignored Kuat, Bothawui and Corellia, instead launching a devastating [[Battle of Fondor (Yuuzhan Vong War)|attack]] on Fondor.\n\nFurthermore, Shesh's warning to the Yuuzhan Vong commanders, delivered via the Hutts, was not informative enough; the reactivated Centerpoint Station was fired upon the Yuuzhan Vong fleet at Fondor in a last ditch attempt to save the shipyards there. The resulting shockwave wiped out half of the invaders' armada, along with a [[Hapan]] warfleet that had been acting as New Republic reinforcements. The result of the Defense Force's careful scheming had been a disaster and the Senate [[Justice Council]] was convened to investigate the situation and determine how the sneak attack on Fondor had come about. Some blamed the Jedi and their intelligence sources, others sought to condemn the senators involved, and many attacked the Defense Force for its handling of the situation. Admiral [[Sien Sovv]]&mdash;Commodore Brand's superior&mdash;was forced to inform the Justice Council that the Advisory Council meeting precluding the battle had been a farce and, in light of this evidence, Shesh was asked to appear before Justice Council chairman [[Ta'laam Ranth]] and give an account of the briefing.<ref name=\"aoc2\" />\n\nTwo weeks after the Battle of Fondor, the time came for the inquest. With a trio of legal representatives and instructions to allow her lawyers to do most of the talking, Shesh planned to answer sparingly. The hearing was a closed-session but a sizable crowd was present in the amphitheater where it took place; Shesh responded deftly to Ranth's questions, revealing only that she had discussed scenarios with Brand and had spoken with Consul-General Golga Besadii Fir in order to acquire information from the Hutts. Fortunately for Shesh, court protocol stipulated that she could respond only to a narrow range of questions and she was able to exonerate herself of any blame for the blunder. As her questioning reached its conclusion, Shesh was asked to comment on the Jedi. Having attained a great amount of power through her maneuverings thus far, the Kuati senator made her break with pro-Jediism and stated that Skywalker's Order was not infallible. As she left, Shesh was mobbed by the media but only gave a couple of interviews, refusing to answer most questions, before she made her way back to her office. Once Shesh had returned to the office, she watched a holorecording of herself being interviewed outside the hearing, pleased that she had gained more publicity from the episode. Her entertainment was interrupted by the arrival of a man identifying himself as [[Nom Anor|Pedric Cuf]], whom Shesh instructed her secretary to send through into her office.<ref name=\"aoc2\" />\n\nCuf introduced himself as a businessman and, with subtle references to the process of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, indicated that he was in fact a disguised Yuuzhan Vong agent. As this became clear, Shesh became excited by the fact that her long attempts to contact the invaders had been successful, but remained cautious, in case Cuf was a New Republic Intelligence agent. When Cuf made reference to Shesh's good-faith involvement in the Elan affair, the senator feigned ignorance and Cuf prepared to leave. It was only his mention that he had learned of her goodwill toward the Yuuzhan Vong through a meeting with a Hutt that encouraged Shesh that Cuf was genuine. She invited the Yuuzhan Vong agent to remain and talk a while, insinuating that she should be provided with a similar disguise to that which Cuf was wearing so that she could begin her work as a full-blown collaborator.<ref name=\"aoc2\" /> Cuf, in reality Yuuzhan Vong spymaster [[Nom Anor]], had other Yuuzhan Vong agents furnish Shesh with [[Cloaker#Ooglith masquer|ooglith masquers]], which she soon began to use to move around incognito, despite the pain their attachment caused to her skin. The senator was also provided with a [[Villip|communications device]] by which she could contact a high-ranking Yuuzhan Vong [[Warrior caste|warrior]], [[Warmaster]] [[Tsavong Lah]].<ref name=\"bp\" /> For her services, Shesh was offered payment in credits that had been obtained by the Yuuzhan Vong, which she directed to her personal accounts through convoluted channels to disguise their source.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\n===Duro and the Jedi===\n{{Quote|She's practically the head of SELCORE.''\"<br />\"''I know, and SELCORE isn't exactly keeping its commitments.

Maneuvering her way to a position of political primacy in SELCORE, the senator was able to direct the rising flood of refugees to whichever worlds she chose. Working alongside the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh arranged for the refugees of hundreds of planets to be directed to [[Duro/Legends|Duro]], a polluted planet on the outskirts of the Core. In return for attempting to restore the ruined ecosystem, the refugees were promised asylum by the [[Duros High House]] in settlements on the surface.<ref name=\"bp\" /> As the administrating senator of SELCORE,<ref name=\"sbs\" /> Shesh in fact did little to help the refugees, largely due to the fact that she knew of the planet's impending fate.\n\nThe refugees were to be sacrificed to the [[Yun'o|Yuuzhan Vong gods]] and the [[Duro Starshipwright Shipyards]] were to be destroyed. Before long, corruption had riddled SELCORE's system contractor, [[CorDuro Shipping]], whose leadership began to collaborate with the Yuuzhan Vong and the Peace Brigade as well. Shipments were frequently delayed or rerouted, communications problems were rife and defense shortfalls multiple. As the Yuuzhan Vong fleet advanced up the [[Corellian Run/Legends|Corellian Run]] on the way to Duro, seizing [[Falleen/Legends|Falleen]], [[Druckenwell/Legends|Druckenwell]], [[Kalarba/Legends|Kalarba]] and [[Kubindi/Legends|Kubindi]] in a series of swift conquests, criticism was also directed against Chief of State Fey'lya and his management of the war. Once Rodia had [[Battle of Rodia|fallen]] to the invaders, a meeting was convened at which members of the Defense Force, along with Jedi Masters Luke and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]], discussed the situation. For her part, Shesh remained silent as she gleaned information.<ref name=\"bp\" />\n\nWhile Corellia was being discussed, Chelch Dravvad informed the Advisory Council that Centerpoint Station had been rendered inactive following its latest firing. As Fyor Rodan and Borsk Fey'lya criticized rogue Jedi activity, Shesh noted Luke Skywalker's response that many Jedi, such as his nephew [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], were in fact pursuing a pacifistic approach to conflict. The Kuati senator noted both pieces of information for future reference but ultimately decided to withhold the knowledge of Centerpoint Station's inactivity from the invaders. Worried that the Yuuzhan Vong would strike at Coruscant before Shesh had earned herself a position of power under their administration, the Kuati senator instead promised the invaders that she would set agents at work to ensure that Centerpoint Station was disabled.\n\nIt was only a couple of days later that Shesh was in fact contacted by both Jacen Solo and his sister [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]] from Duro, who wished to locate their mother, Leia Organa Solo, on the planet. Shesh feigned interest and politeness, earning Jacen Solo's scrutiny as she did so, and promised to use her resources to find Organa Solo. The transmission was interrupted on the Duro end by a Hutt, [[Randa Besadii Diori]], who urgently beseeched Shesh to send troops to aid the Hutts, currently fighting for their lives against the Yuuzhan Vong following the failure of their treaty. The senator cut the transmission off but before long was contacted by Warmaster Tsavong Lah for the first time on Yuuzhan Vong communications device&mdash;known as a villip&mdash;that she had been given. Shesh was surprised and shocked to witness the full extent of the warmaster's mutilations but regained her composure and set about making herself clear.<ref name=\"bp\" />\n\nThe advance on Duro was not an issue for the senator, but Shesh found the proximity of her native Kuat to the [[Duro system]] worrisome and wished to ensure that the warmaster would not subsequently attack the Kuat shipyards. She made apparent her desire for peace and requested that Lah reassure her of the impending cessation of the invasion. Mollified by the warrior, Shesh was reminded that she would be greatly rewarded when the time came and the Yuuzhan Vong stood victorious. When Lah brusquely brought matters to a close, Shesh decided to gain further favor with the warmaster by announcing that she would be able to orchestrate the abduction and delivery of a young Jedi Knight who was present on Duro, as she was aware of the warmaster's military interest in Force-sensitives. Shesh was referring to Jacen Solo, and although she mentioned that the young Human was not making use of his abilities, the Kuati senator did not mention Solo by name. Once Shesh had revealed this information, she was silenced by the warmaster and the transmission was ended. The senator continued to lead her double life, maintaining cautious measures to ensure that no knowledge of her duplicity ever leaked.\n\nHer servants swept the office three times a day for listening devices and she ensured that, other than her contact with Tsavong Lah, her illicit affairs were coordinated through third party contacts. Due to this approach, Shesh's carefully cultivated reputation remained intact. The senator did maintain a pretense of interest in the doomed refugee efforts on the surface of Duro due to her lofty position in SELCORE. Contacted by a [[Tynnan/Legends|Tynnan]] and a Human pair of technicians from [[Gateway]] settlement, Shesh was discussing matters of the colony when the transmission was once again interrupted by Randa Besadii Diori. The excitable Hutt informed her that a Yuuzhan Vong agent was operating somewhere on Duro and that she needed to send support urgently. Shesh immediately asked whether the Hutt had actually succeeded in unmasking the infiltrator; once he admitted that he had not, she fobbed him off with the promise that she would have Leia Organa Solo, whom Shesh had learned was the administrator of Gateway, investigate the claim.<ref name=\"bp\" />\n\nOnce the Hutt had left, Shesh concluded her business with the communications technicians and contacted Tsavong Lah to inform him of what had occurred. A short time later, the warmaster advanced his forces upon the planet. Jedi liaison [[Kenth Hamner]] came before Borsk Fey'lya to plead the case for a defense of Duro. As the last step in the process of sealing the planet's fate, Shesh delivered a persuasive address stating that no [[Warship/Legends|warships]] should be spared to aid Duro as this would weaken the defenses of other worlds. Unknowingly aiding her and the Yuuzhan Vong, the Quarren Pwoe also reminded the senators that false alerts had been called in on Duro before. Fey'lya and his council voted against Hamner's proposal. The warmaster's armada [[Battle of Duro (Yuuzhan Vong War)|struck]] at Duro with overwhelming numbers, destroying all but [[Urrdorf City|one]] of the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] population's orbital cities along with the shipyards. The vast majority of the refugees whom Shesh had directed to the world were captured or killed. In an unexpected turn of events for the Kuati senator, however, Jacen Solo rescued his mother from captivity, injuring and humiliating Tsavong Lah in the process. Outraged, the warmaster issued a galaxy-wide address to the New Republic, proclaiming that the invasion would stop at Duro, so long as the Jedi Order was surrendered to the invaders. Emphasis was put on the capture of Jacen Solo.<ref name=\"bp\" /> All over the galaxy, a fearful citizenry responded to the warmaster's demands.<ref name=\"eov1\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]''</ref>\n\nShesh and Kuat remained closely connected to the activities of the Peace Brigade, who were central in the pogrom against the Jedi.<ref name=\"eov2\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]''</ref> The senator was able to point the Peace Brigade in direction of the [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]],<ref name=\"njosb\" /> which was later attacked and destroyed.<ref name=\"eov1\" /> Supplies were sent from Kuat to the Yuuzhan Vong and the Peace Brigade, although Shesh set up several companies as fronts so the true source of her aid to the collaborators could never be determined.<ref name=\"eov2\" /> Alongside her continued support of other collaborators, Shesh put a new plan in motion to eliminate the threat of the Jedi on behalf of her Yuuzhan Vong masters. Despite the success of the Peace Brigade and other factions in turning individual Jedi over to the invaders, the senator recognized that she was well equipped to strike at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order with the power of the New Republic government, if she could accrue enough support in the Senate.<ref name=\"r\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]''</ref> The Kuati woman began to agitate increasingly vocally against the Jedi, aided in her campaign by her Staff Chief, Victor Pomt.<ref name=\"mafr\" /> Shesh drew up an outline for the [[Peace Vote]], a Senate motion that would outlaw the Jedi and mobilize the New Republic judicial system against the Order, allowing the Yuuzhan Vong to neutralize the threat with ease. First, however, Shesh was determined to eliminate Leia Organa Solo, whom the senator believed had witnessed too much of the corruption that had riddled CorDuro Shipping and the possibilities of Shesh's duplicity to be left alive. She entrusted the task to Staff Chief Pomt who mobilized resources against the injured Jedi, whom Pomt soon learned had been taken to a [[Coronet Medcenter|hospital]] in [[Coronet/Legends|Coronet]], the capital city of Corellia. Shesh's staff chief dispatched [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]] against [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and Leia Organa Solo and later a task force of starships, all of which failed.<ref name=\"r\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Shesh announced her proposal for the Appeasement Vote to the New Republic Senate, striking a deal with Fey'lya which ensured that the body would vote on the matter by the end of the week; Tsavong Lah's ultimatum had prejudiced many against the Jedi Order, especially senators from worlds as yet untouched by the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Unfortunately for Shesh, the Solos evaded the assassination attempts and made their way to Coruscant, retaining the evidence of Shesh's close ties with CorDuro Shipping. As the Duro corporation had been openly outed as a collaborationist organization, which Shesh had contracted in her position as administrative senator of SELCORE, the implications risked exposing the Kuati woman. Furthermore, Leia Organa Solo contacted Senator [[Kvarm Jia]] and called for a meeting of the [[Corruption Panel]] to investigate Shesh. The Kuati woman was under pressure to accrue enough support for the Appeasement Vote to prevent the results of the hearing from impacting adversely upon the anti-Jedi movement. As such, she continued to solicit support and instead sent Staff Chief Pomt before the Corruption Panel and its chairperson, the [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] senator [[E'noro]]. Before doing so, Pomt initiated a last ditch attack on the Solos as they approached Coruscant that resulted in failure. The Solos arrived at the [[Senate Inquiry Room]] for the Corruption Panel hearing in time to present the evidence of Pomt's assassinations attempts to E'noro; Pomt scorned the accusations, but the damage was done. Shesh's staff chief was stripped of his position pending further investigation. Shesh was interrupted from a meeting by news that E'noro was attempting to contact her. When Shesh responded to the irate Bith senator, she was rebuked and informed that her senatorial privileges were revoked until an investigation could be held in the next month.<ref name=\"r\" />\n\nFurious at the setback and aware that Pomt knew too much of her dealings, Shesh dispatched an assassin to eliminate her staff chief.<ref name=\"mafr\" /> The assassin killed Pomt several days after the hearing and arranged matters so that the staff chief appeared to have committed suicide. A message was left with Pomt's corpse claiming sole responsibility for the attacks on the Solos; with him went the evidence of Shesh's collaboration with CorDuro Shipping. The case against Shesh was dropped following Pomt's death. Nevertheless, Organa Solo's efforts to expose the senator had called Shesh's integrity into question. With knowledge of Shesh's possible corruption now public, the Appeasement Vote lost support and attained only a third of the votes in the New Republic Senate&mdash;a significant number, but not enough to outlaw Skywalker's Order.<ref name=\"r\" /> Leia Organa Solo's accusations, although lacking evidence and undermined by Pomt's faked suicide, also damaged Shesh's reputation.\n\nThe Kuati woman was rotated off SELCORE. Before long, however, Shesh had regained her senatorial status and managed to attain a position on the [[New Republic Military Oversight Committee]], a body of senators that oversaw the operations of the New Republic Defense Force against the Yuuzhan Vong. Once again in a position to observe the top secret workings of the Defense Force, Shesh was equipped with a [[chilab]], a Yuuzhan Vong observation device, with which she was instructed by Tsavong Lah to record NRMOC meetings and report back to him. The Kuati woman provided Lah with a steady flow of sensitive information. She also attempted to inset [[sensislug]]s&mdash;other Yuuzhan Vong observations devices&mdash;into the NRMOC meeting chambers, but was unable to do so as she inadvertently killed the fragile creatures when deploying them.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> Meanwhile, Shesh passed on information concerning the disposition of the Coruscant Planetary Defense Force over the galactic capital.<ref name=\"njosb\" />\n\n===Machinations===\n{{Quote|I've spent all morning talking to Core senators. We don't have the votes to win a no-confidence call, but I'm convinced that were Borsk to meet an untimely end, the next chief of state would be less favorably disposed toward the Jedi.|Viqi Shesh, to Warmaster Tsavong Lah|The New Jedi Order: Star by Star}}\nAlthough Shesh's Appeasement Vote had failed, anti-Jediism was still rife. Furthermore, the Yuuzhan Vong had their own methods for dealing with the Jedi and before long the senator was contacted by the Yuuzhan Vong with a request. During the conquest of the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, Yuuzhan Vong bioscientists had learned of the [[vornskr]], a creature native to Myrkr that hunted Force-sensitives. Shesh was asked to procure some of these creatures for study; the senator duly dispatched a number of captured vornskr to the Yuuzhan Vong, whose scientists were able to crossbreed with the [[fero xyn]] to create [[voxyn]]. Bred specifically to hunt Jedi, voxyn were unleashed on space stations and planets across the galaxy, whereupon they tracked and killed Force-sensitives. Four Jedi were eliminated in quick succession. To complement the voxyn scheme, Warmaster Lah arrayed a billion refugees in orbit over the planet [[Talfaglio]], demanding the surrender of the Jedi and the location of their [[Eclipse (planet)|secret base]] in return for the safety of the refugees. In the resulting political climate, the anti-Jedi and pro-Jedi blocs came into mass conflict and the New Republic Senate was split by partisan. Shesh was called to an NRMOC closed-session meeting at which Leia Organa Solo was scheduled to deliver a report on the Talfaglion refugees and Tsavong Lah's ultimatum.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nWhen Organa Solo arrived with her son Jacen, Shesh did not waste time before delivering her first criticisms of the Jedi and embarrassing her political enemy. She called attention to the tactical quagmire faced by the Defense Force&mdash;if the Talfaglion refugees were to be liberated, the Yuuzhan Vong fleet massed in the nearby [[Jumus system]] were in a prime position to fall upon any attacking forces. Senator Kvarm Jia backed Jacen Solo's proposal that a trio of [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]] could be sneaked in via [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] hyperspace routes to rescue the refugees but Shesh lambasted the suggestion, claiming that the three Star Destroyers would be lost along with any number of planets, all in order to save the Talfaglion refugees militarily when a diplomatic solution&mdash;the surrender of the Jedi&mdash;was possible. The former Chief of State put a halt to the resulting uproar by requesting that the matter be put to vote, whereupon it passed marginally in Organa Solo's favor. Despite the vote, Chief of State Fey'lya, in Shesh's opinion manipulated through her anti-Jediism, refused to allow the Star Destroyer strike to go ahead, however, stating that a military study was first necessary. As Shesh had hoped, Fey'lya planned to stall for time by requesting that a Yuuzhan Vong envoy be sent to discuss terms.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n[[File:Senator_Borsk_Fey'lya.jpg||thumb|200px|left|Bothan Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya.]]\n\nSoon after the NRMOC meeting, Shesh contacted Tsavong Lah with the news of the impending New Republic request for an envoy and informed him that the extra time she had won the warmaster could be used to prepare a counterambush to the Star Destroyer strike. The senator was surprised when Lah announced that Pedric Cuf was also present with him on his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]]. The warmaster asked her to recount the information to Cuf and Shesh did so obediently, exaggerating her role in the NRMOC proceedings. Lah decided to send an envoy, selecting Nom Anor, whom Shesh still did not know was the undisguised Pedric Cuf. On Coruscant, the Kuati woman was asked by the media to comment on the envoy's impending arrival in the Senate; Shesh used the moment to reiterate her stance against the Jedi, whom she blamed for placing their own safety above those of the Talfaglion refugees. The New Republic Senate prepared for the visit with mixed responses. The [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorians]] boycotted the envoy's visit along with numerous others, leaving close to one hundred senatorial balconies empty in the Grand Convocation Chamber. Fey'lya lost a great deal of support for agreeing even to countenance negotiating with the Yuuzhan Vong. Nevertheless, the Talfaglion consular staff and other prominent politicians supported Fey'lya's efforts. For her part, Shesh stood alongside the Chief of State with Fyor Rodan of Commenor in a show of solidarity.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nThe chamber was packed with security and media as the galaxy prepared to watch Fey'lya's address to the envoy via the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] and, as the envoy entered, the three politicians moved forward to meet him. As Nom Anor revealed himself, demonstrating the Yuuzhan Vong slight to the New Republic in sending such a prominent agent of destruction as an envoy, Fey'lya collected himself and went on the offensive. As the Wookiees&mdash;fervent supporters of the Jedi&mdash;voiced their approval of Fey'lya's assertive stance, the Talfaglions and their bloc attempted to shout them down. Shesh left Fey'lya's side to restore order, as she knew she would waste a prime chance for publicity if the negotiations were derailed. To her shock, however, the Bothan Chief of State failed to behave as she had hoped. Fey'lya tricked Anor into revealing that the Yuuzhan Vong saw New Republic lives as meaningless, which proved a bitter blow to those who believed that the invaders were a species with which peace was possible.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> It became clear that Shesh's superior was intending to strengthen the failing ties between the Jedi and the New Republic by affirming their solidarity in such a public arena, thus winning support from the pro-Jedi bloc, while he convinced the anti-Jedi bloc that negotiations were futile.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nThe last thing Shesh wanted was Fey'lya to reunite the disjointed New Republic government. She intervened, stating that Fey'lya was not making himself clear but, to her chagrin, the Bothan silenced her and dismissed her from his side. Shesh's scheme to split the Senate had failed; Fey'lya began to mock Anor and assert the New Republic's support for the Jedi, prompting hundreds of senators to rise in his support. Once the session had ended, Shesh set about salvaging the situation. She met with members of the anti-Jedi bloc, most of whom, like her, represented the threatened Core Worlds, and encouraged them to move for a [[Vote of No Confidence/Legends|Vote of No Confidence]] in Chief of State Fey'lya. Unfortunately for Shesh, she could not scrounge enough support for the motion to pass and gave up on the idea. She contacted the Yuuzhan Vong warmaster and informed him of her efforts, indicating that if Fey'lya were to be eliminated, she could rise to prominence as the most viable candidate. When Lah responded to this suggestion by directing Shesh to kill the Bothan personally, the shocked senator refused, earning the warmaster's ire and placing them both in a stalemate, with Lah threatening to reveal her as a spy and Shesh reminding him of the importance of inside knowledge on NRMOC. Relenting, Lah informed her that [[Bjork Umi]], a Yuuzhan Vong assassin, would soon contact her for details of Fey'lya's movements. Once Umi came into contact with her, Shesh issued the Yuuzhan Vong warrior with a list of ideal times and locations at which assassination could be attempted. As days went by with no news, the pressure was on Shesh to find other means of proving her worth before the Yuuzhan Vong took Coruscant and decided to stop retaining her services.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\n===Fall and revelation===\n{{Quote|Viqi Shesh paid us a visit. She had a squad of infiltrators with her.''\"<br />\"''They were after Ben?|Leia Organa Solo and Luke Skywalker|The New Jedi Order: Star by Star}}\nTsavong Lah continued in his attempts to orchestrate the destruction of the Jedi, dispatching Nom Anor to the New Republic Senate once again. Having been uninformed of the reasons behind Anor's second visit to the Senate, Shesh traveled to the Grand Convocation Chamber in order to observe the situation in her capacity as a senator. When the Yuuzhan Vong executor arrived, Shesh was alarmed by the amount of support Fey'lya appeared to have attained since his pro-Jedi stance during the last meeting with Anor. The Kuati politician was further surprised when Anor announced that Warmaster Lah had agreed to extend the deadline for the surrender of the Jedi. Querying Anor on the subject, Shesh was stunned when the Yuuzhan Vong envoy stated that [[Myrkr strike team|seventeen Jedi]] had been turned over to the Yuuzhan Vong the previous evening. Among the captured Jedi, Anor announced, were Jacen, Jaina and [[Anakin Solo]]. Shesh observed interestedly as Anor reacted in a shocked manner to the common knowledge of the fact that Jacen and Jaina Solo were twins. Realizing that this was seemingly a significant matter to the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh believed she could capitalize on Anor's ignorance and gain favor with Lah at the executor's expense. Anor continued with his address, demanding that a similar number of Jedi was to be surrendered every ten days. Despite Borsk Fey'lya's attempts to silence the Yuuzhan Vong envoy, Shesh ensured that the New Republic Senate and the media remained privy to the new ultimatum. In response, the Bothan Chief of State rounded on Shesh, speaking of Yuuzhan Vong diplomacy.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nThe Kuati woman observed in horror as Mif Kumas and a trio of security [[Droid/Legends|droids]] approached, certain that her status as a collaborator was about to be revealed to the galaxy. Her attempts to leave thwarted, Shesh sat transfixed as Fey'lya stated that an assassination attempt had indeed been made upon his life&mdash;Umi and his cohorts had acted without Shesh's knowledge&mdash;and asked her to speak up on the matter. Shesh initially believed that Umi must have been interrogated and divulged her involvement but when Fey'lya began to mention Kuat, she realized to her vast relief that the Bothan knew nothing of her status as a spy and was instead attempting to chastise her for believing that the Yuuzhan Vong were a reasonable species with whom a bargain was possible. Displaying contrition, Shesh admitted that in her opinion the Yuuzhan Vong were clearly untrustworthy. The Chief of State ordered Kumas and the security droids to arrest Nom Anor, who rendered Shesh unconscious, along with the rest of those present in the Grand Convocation Chamber, with a sleeping gas before fleeing Coruscant.\n\nDays went past without contact from Tsavong Lah and the Talfaglion blockade ultimatum was soon thwarted by Luke Skywalker and the Jedi Order. It transpired that with the aid of Generals [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and Garm Bel Iblis, respectively commanding the Star Destroyers [[Mon Mothma (Imperial-class)|''Mon Mothma'']] and [[Elegos A'Kla (Imperial-class)|''Elegos A'Kla'']], the Jedi had broken the Talfaglion blockade, absconding with the refugees and inflicting a massive defeat upon the Yuuzhan Vong defense. It was a political victory for Fey'lya, whose pro-Jedi stance was vindicated, as well as for Luke Skywalker, who was asked to appear, alongside his sister Leia Organa Solo, before the New Republic Senate shortly after the [[Operation Safe Passage|battle]] had occurred. Shesh was aware that there was still anti-Jedi sentiment to be exploited; by the time Skywalker arrived, without his sister, she had marshaled her facts.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nAs Antilles and Bel Iblis had technically participated in an unsanctioned fleet operation, the official story was that the generals had been conducting a shakedown cruise and had happened upon the Battle of Talfaglio, subsequently entering the fray alongside the Jedi. Shesh was quick to seize the moment and ridicule this story and, despite Fey'lya's retorts, insinuated that the Jedi had performed [[Mind trick/Legends|mind tricks]] on Antilles and Bel Iblis in order to secure their support. She found allies, as she had intended, among the senators representing the threatened worlds of the [[Inner Rim]], such as fellow Advisory Council member Fyor Rodan, who obstructed Fey'lya as Shesh continued to pour forth scorn upon the Jedi. Skywalker challenged Shesh's claims with calmness but the Kuati politician was unwilling to back down, demanding that the military cooperation with the Jedi Order cease immediately. It was a step back from the Appeasement Vote she had championed in the weeks prior but Shesh's demand had the intended effect of removing the focus from the Jedi victory at Talfaglio and splitting the New Republic Senate along pro-Jedi and anti-Jedi factions. As Fey'lya remained engrossed in his personal [[vidconsole]], however, Shesh decided to propose a motion that the Jedi were to be regarded as dangerous persons to the war effort. Fey'lya interrupted the Kuati politician with the news that leading figures in the New Republic military had contacted him demanding that he ignore Shesh's motion and allow the war effort to proceed with Jedi involvement. Fey'lya issued an executive order that overrode Shesh and her planned motion. As the military was the last hope for the Inner Rim senators, they preferred to follow Fey'lya's lead rather than attempt a Vote of No Confidence and lose the support of the New Republic Defense Force. Shesh realized that Fey'lya and Skywalker had undone her; she lost her seat on the New Republic Military Oversight Committee, thus being stripped of much of her political power.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nFor Viqi Shesh, it was therefore time to abandon the New Republic government and the Senate as her vehicles for proving her worth to the Yuuzhan Vong leadership. Lah recognized this as well, instructing Shesh to locate the [[Eclipse (planet)|secret Jedi base]] from which the Order were harassing his military operations and accrue as much information as possible on the new technology the Jedi were utilizing. Meeting with a Yuuzhan Vong contact, the Kuati woman obtained another sensislug but refused the offer of an ooglith masquer, preferring to use a New Republic Intelligence disguise kit to mask her features. In order to ascertain the location of the Jedi base, Shesh targeted Han and Leia Organa Solo. She discovered from an informant that the Solos owned a private residence in the [[Eastport]] administrative district. Heavily disguised and throwing off the pursuit of a young Jedi, Shesh made her way to the Solos' Eastport apartment, intending to insert the Yuuzhan Vong spy device into the residence. While she was trying to formulate a plan to enter the apartment, Shesh was forced to hide when the Solos arrived with their droid [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], the infant [[Ben Skywalker]] and a [[TDL nanny droid]]. Once she had thrown the sensislug onto C-3PO's back and turned to leave, however, Shesh ran into [[Adarakh]], one of the Solos' [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]] bodyguards. As the group's scrutiny of her intensified, Shesh acted as though she were senile and mad before shuffling away.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nOver the next days, Shesh made use of a number of contacts to ascertain the nature of the Jedi technology such as the [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetically]] hurled [[Jedi shadow bomb|torpedoes]] wreaking havoc among Lah's forces. Shesh also passed on the technical readouts of the [[Gravity well projector/Legends|gravity well projectors]] installed upon the ''Mon Mothma'' and the ''Elegos A'Kla'' as well as the disposition of the hyperspace mines being laid between Coruscant and [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]], the latter of which had recently [[Battle of Borleias (Yuuzhan Vong War; First)|fallen]] to Tsavong Lah's forces. The warmaster was pleased with Shesh's rapid progress and instructed her to carry out another task&mdash;the kidnapping of Ben Skywalker. Eager to exact revenge on Luke Skywalker for the part that Shesh felt he had played in her political downfall, the Kuati senator nevertheless realized that Lah's request that she distract the Jedi by abducting Skywalker's son meant that the warmaster intended to move upon Coruscant imminently. Due to this belief, Shesh decided to conduct her abduction of Ben Skywalker without bothering to disguise herself. Analysis of the security surrounding the Solos' Eastport residence indicated that any attempts to mask her appearance would be in vain. Shesh also felt that Luke Skywalker should know who had kidnapped his son in retaliation for her political downfall. The Kuati woman coordinated a group of six Yuuzhan Vong, led by the warrior [[Ingo Dar]], and hatched her plot to abduct the Skywalker child. Ingo Dar instructed his warriors to disguise themselves as members of the [[Municipal Health Bureau]] and followed Shesh to Eastport. Meanwhile, Shesh had a [[Hoversled/Legends|hoversled]] placed below a balcony attached to the Solos' apartment for her swift getaway.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nApproaching the Solos' apartment from the front entrance, Shesh triggered the sensislug with an [[ultrasonic whistle]] to release a cloud of sleep-inducing spores. With Ingo Dar and his warriors behind her, Shesh was surprised when the [[GL-7]] droid at the door greeted her and invited her inside. Deciding to make use of the Solos' apparently poor security, Shesh went inside where the [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] C-3PO shocked her by announcing that her arrival was expected. Utilizing the previously discovered sensislug against Shesh and her Yuuzhan Vong team, C-3PO knocked out several of the infiltrators while the Noghri Adarakh opened fire with a [[T-21 light repeating blaster/Legends|T-21 repeating blaster]]. The Yuuzhan Vong were cut down and Shesh fled, dodging a [[Meewalh|second Noghri]] while wielding her [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]]. The Kuati woman dove over the balcony onto the hoversled and escaped the scene of the failed kidnapping attempt. Making use of an ooglith masquer, Shesh went into hiding in the Coruscant underlevels. The HoloNet broadcast her status as a Yuuzhan Vong spy and as a traitor to the New Republic to the galaxy, bringing Shesh's political career to an end. Shortly after her allegiance to the Yuuzhan Vong was made public knowledge, Lah contacted Shesh briefly to inform her that if she failed to deliver Ben Skywalker, she would not be spared during the imminent conquest of Coruscant.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> The news of Shesh's collaboration spread across the galaxy and had profound consequences for Kuat Drive Yards.

While disguised in her ooglith masquer, the former senator spotted a young boy, [[Dab Hantaq]], pickpocketing a [[Salt/Legends|salt]]-drunk [[Arcona/Legends|Arcona]]. Shesh approached Hantaq with a proposition. The young Anakin Solo had at that time recently died during a [[Mission to Myrkr|mission]] to Myrkr to eliminate the voxyn queen from which the voxyn creatures were being [[Cloning/Legends|cloned]]. Shesh decided that in order to have a chance of abducting Ben Skywalker from the Solos and their entourage, she would need to create a doppelg\u00e4nger of Anakin Solo to distract her opponents, who were still grieving over the death of their youngest child. Dab Hantaq, although over four years younger that Solo, agreed to undergo extensive cosmetic surgery in return for the safety of his mothers and sisters, whom Shesh promised would be safe aboard her private yacht, the ''[[Wicked Pleasure]]''. Modeling Hantaq as Anakin Solo cost Shesh a small fortune but the end result, after a few days of intensive surgery and [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] treatment, was exactly as she had wished. Shesh instructed the boy to introduce himself as [[Tarc Kether]] to the Solos, whose involvement she did not mention, while she would masquerade as [[Welda Kether]], a Human woman who had lost her husband [[Ran Kether]] at the [[Battle of Kalarba]], the same battle at which Shesh knew Jaina Solo had been injured in 26 ABY. Ran Kether had indeed died at [[Kalarba/Legends|Kalarba]],<ref name=\"cswe\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> and to Shesh's knowledge had been a member of [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] known to Han Solo.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Warmaster Lah's fleet emerged in the [[Coruscant system/Legends|Coruscant system]] and [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|besieged]] the galactic capital. The world was soon thrown into chaos as the military fractured and the New Republic Senate began fleeing the planet, taking with them sections of the defense fleets. The mass evacuation that followed occurred during [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]] and aerial [[Starfighter combat/Legends|dogfighting]] that Shesh knew would force the Solos to attempt to flee. With the young boy in tow, to whom she gave a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]], Shesh disguised her voice with Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology, armed herself with a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]] and a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and set off for the [[Eastport]] Docking Facility. There, her own yacht was berthed in [[Docking Bay 3732]], crewed and awaiting her arrival. Before long, Shesh spotted the Solos near [[Gate 3700]], which was itself in close proximity to where the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], personal starship of Han Solo, was located in its own docking bay. Shesh informed the young boy that the Solos were to be the target and together they approached the family through the crowd. Shesh introduced herself in her Welda persona, greeting Han Solo and quickly gaining his trust by referring to Ran Kether and the Battle of Kalarba, while distracting Leia Organa Solo with Hantaq, whom she eagerly displayed before the family. The disguised Kuati claimed to be seeking passage on the ''[[Byrt]]'', a starferry taking on refugees at the docking facility. Having taken a liking to \"Welda\" and her son, the Solos promised Shesh and Hantaq asylum on the ''Millennium Falcon''. While attempting to gain access to the ''Millennium Falcon'', Hantaq hurled the thermal detonator on the ground and ran. Shesh blocked off Leia Organa Solo's escape route with a blaster and pandemonium ensued.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nThe crowd attempted to flee from the explosive while [[YVH 1-507A]], one of the Solos' security droids, tried to prevent the device from detonating. Meewalh, the second Noghri bodyguard, pursued Hantaq while Adarakh hurled herself at Shesh, biting deep into her arm and forcing the Kuati to drop her blaster. Shesh managed to unsheath her vibroblade just as Adarakh ripped the ooglith masquer from her face. She stabbed the Noghri deep in the torso, killing him. The Kuati then attempted to kill Ben Skywalker by hurling the vibroblade, following a brief exchange with Leia Organa Solo. Shesh fled, covered in [[Blood/Legends|blood]] from the forcible removal of her ooglith masquer, to the ''Wicked Pleasure'' in Docking Bay 3732. Han Solo fired upon her from one direction while his wife pursued closely. The crew of the ''Wicked Pleasure'' managed to keep the Solos at bay but when Leia Organa Solo used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to hurl her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] at Shesh while she raced up the boarding ramp, the Kuati was unable to prevent the blade from slicing deep into her back. The former senator was dragged onboard the yacht by her crew. The ''Wicked Pleasure'' left the Eastport Docking Facility and pursued the starferry ''Byrt'' into orbit&mdash;Shesh discovered that in the confusion, C-3PO had been swept onto the ''Byrt'' while carrying Ben Skywalker in his arms. Recognizing that she could still salvage the situation, Shesh alerted the Yuuzhan Vong fleet that she needed support in boarding the ''Byrt''. The Kuati drugged herself up on painkillers and watched as the ''Wicked Pleasure'' pursued the starferry into the chaos of Coruscant's mass evacuation.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nDespite the attempts of Luke and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] to recover their son by pursuing the ''Byrt'' themselves in their [[X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]], Shesh was able to lead the Yuuzhan Vong warships to the starferry, which she boarded along with a large force of Yuuzhan Vong warriors who interrogated and [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] crew and began searching for Ben Skywalker. While the Kuati led a rushed search for the Jedi infant, entrepreneur [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], a family friend of the Solos and the Skywalkers, boarded the starferry with a force of [[YVH-Series battle droid|Yuuzhan Vong Hunter]] war droids and began cutting down warriors aboard the starship. Shesh led a party of over two dozen Yuuzhan Vong warriors to an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] launching bay where she soon heard a wailing Human infant. Just as a [[YVH 1-25A|YVH war droid]] appeared behind her team and eliminated a number of them in a matter of seconds, Shesh spotted C-3PO in [[Escape Bay 14]] hiding with the infant while taking cover herself. The Yuuzhan Vong warriors released [[singularity mine]]s to delay the war droids and flooded into Escape Bay 14 to capture the Jedi child. C-3PO was in an escape pod from which were emerging the sounds of an infant wailing. Shesh and her cohorts rushed to the pod, under heavy fire from a large number of Calrissian's YVH war droids.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nScrambling into the pod, Shesh and the surviving warriors shoved the golden protocol droid out of the escape pod as [[YVH 1-1A|a YVH droid]] raced to prevent their departure. Just before the YVH droid could reach them, the escape pod hatch sealed and it was blasted out into [[Realspace/Legends|space]]. Only then did the wounded former senator realize that Ben Skywalker was not in the escape pod&mdash;C-3PO had used his voice function to mimic the sound of a Human infant and the real Jedi child was safe in a locker in Escape Bay 14.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> Shesh was now into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong without anything to show for her efforts and with the knowledge that Lah had promised her execution for failure. Kept alive during the rest of the Battle of Coruscant until her audience with the warmaster, Shesh's wounds were treated by the Yuuzhan Vong with [[neathlat]]s, which acted as a living, uncomfortable bandage.<ref name=\"el1\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref> Coruscant fell to the Yuuzhan Vong warmaster&mdash;just as Tsavong Lah had always intended&mdash;and Shesh's earlier efforts to appease the invaders by delivering Duro and the Jedi were shown to have been futile.<ref name=\"sbs\" /><ref name=\"bp\" /> In his office, Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya committed suicide with a [[Proton bomb/Legends|proton bomb]], eliminating 25,000 Yuuzhan Vong warriors in the process.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> The Yuuzhan Vong had no intention, however, of installing Viqi Shesh in the Bothan's place.<ref name=\"el1\" />\n\n===New assignments===\n{{Quote|I am killing you because you ''are'' no longer a resource, Viqi.''\"<br />\"''But I am.

Escorted by two Yuuzhan Vong warriors to what Shesh believed would be her final moments, the ex-senator was in a state of quiet terror, although she nurtured the hope that she could bargain with the warmaster. Once she was before Lah, however, the warrior wasted no time in informing Shesh that she was to be imminently executed and that only through contrition could she choose the manner of her passing. Desperately, Shesh alighted on a means by which she could evade execution. She took note of Lah's failing warrior implant&mdash;a [[radank]] claw the warmaster had had attached in the place of his left arm following the conquest of Borleias.\n\nThe newly-grafted limb was diseased and rotting, so Shesh concocted a plausible story&mdash;which was in fact, unbeknownst to her, the truth&mdash;that the warrior was being manipulated by the Yuuzhan Vong [[Shaper caste|bioscientists]] who had grafted the radank claw onto Lah's arm. Shesh informed the warmaster that he was going to be encouraged by his shapers and [[Priest caste|priests]] to carry out certain courses of action; if he listened to this advice, the shapers and priests would allow his arm to heal. If not, his condition would worsen. Shesh was confident that the story would enable her survival while Lah investigated her claims, during which time she could escape her masters. As she expected, Lah allowed her to live. Silently triumphant, the ex-senator was led from the chamber.<ref name=\"el1\" />\n\n[[Tam Elgrin]], a young holocam operator who worked alongside historian [[Wolam Tser]], had been captured and suborned by the Yuuzhan Vong and ordered to accompany Tser and gain intelligence. Lah ordered Shesh to direct Elgrin's progress via villip. The former senator was not afforded any trust, however. She was followed at all times by [[Denua Ku]], a Yuuzhan Vong warrior who observed her every move. Directing Elgrin and spending time in her quarters proved tedious for Shesh and she soon chafed under the terms of her survival. Several days after her close encounter with Tsavong Lah, Shesh received a new report from Elgrin: the young Human was on nearby [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]], where elements of the [[New Republic Third Fleet]] had set up a defense in the aftermath of Coruscant's fall. She instructed Elgrin to plant listening and transmitting devices around the base on Borleias, to gain the trust of scientist [[Danni Quee]] and learn of her research and to sow discord among the command staff. Once she had finished communicating with Elgrin, Shesh asked Denua Ku to allow her to study Yuuzhan Vong technology, aware that her time was running out and that she needed to prove herself useful in other areas. Lah granted Shesh's request. The direction of Elgrin remained her primary assignment, however, and Shesh communicated frequently with both the Human and the Yuuzhan Vong present on Borleias. With the knowledge that Tsavong Lah still wished to possess Jaina Solo, who was present at the garrison on Borleias, Shesh arranged for Elgrin to receive a number of Yuuzhan Vong devices with which he could track the Jedi's starfighter and ensure that Solo would be captured. Once Elgrin contacted her and informed her that Solo's starfighter had been affixed with one of the tracking bugs, Shesh ordered him to apprise her of the garrison's reaction to Solo's capture.<ref name=\"el1\" />\n\nAs it happened, the Yuuzhan Vong forces in the [[Pyria system]], where Borleias was located, were unable to capture the young Jedi and a few days later, an attack was launched on ''Domain Dal'' from the outskirts of the Coruscant system. Lah had Shesh brought before him and ordered the former senator to discover how the Borleias garrison had seemingly fired a powerful [[Laser/Legends|laser]] beam at ''Domain Dal'' from the Pyria system. Shesh in turn instructed Elgrin to find out this information by breaking into Danni Quee's office on Borleias and communicating the results of Quee's research to the Yuuzhan Vong. Once the intelligence was returned to her, Shesh went before the warmaster, alongside Supreme Commander [[Maal Lah]], to deliver her report. With visual evidence of Quee's research provided by Elgrin, Shesh posited that the laser beam had been fired by a [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] constructed by the New Republic in the Pyria system, through Quee's apparent merging of New Republic and Yuuzhan Vong technology. Silenced by the warmaster for this statement, as the discussion of hybrid machine and organic technology was considered heresy for the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh allowed Maal Lah to continue. The supreme commander informed Lah that such a merging of technology was possible and the warmaster subsequently communicated with his father, [[Czulkang Lah]], who was commanding Yuuzhan Vong forces in the Pyria system. Lah, trusting Shesh's report, ordered his father to launch a full scale [[Battle of Borleias (Yuuzhan Vong War; Second)|attack]] on the garrison.<ref name=\"el1\" />\n\nThe attack failed. Elgrin had in fact been identified as a spy and fed false information. The young Human went on to rebel against his conditioning and turn himself in to the New Republic. Shesh's assignment had resulted in failure,<ref name=\"el1\" /> although the ex-senator's time as Lah's agent had not yet come to an end. Before long, Shesh was brought before the warmaster again. In the face of her expectations, Shesh discovered that her concocted story about Lah's shapers and priests conspiring against her had actually been true. The warmaster had weeded out the conspirators and, as such, Shesh's bid for time had brought her less than she had wanted. The former senator had no escape plans in mind as such and, as Lah informed her of her next assignment, Shesh became even more terrified that her death was soon to be upon her. Believing that Jedi were active on the surface of Coruscant&mdash;which had undergone a vast terraforming process and now consisted of a ruined cityscape overgrown with Yuuzhan Vong growths&mdash;Lah ordered Shesh to travel down the surface of the planet along with Denua Ku, a search party and a pack of voxyn, in order to locate, kill or capture the Jedi. The panicked Kuati woman was stunned into silence, aware that her survival chances as an adviser to a warrior party on Coruscant were just as slender as they were on the Yuuzhan Vong worldship.<ref name=\"el2\" />\n\n===Last days===\n{{Quote|Yuuzhan Vong can't kill me.

There's only one thing in this universe that can kill Viqi Shesh.|Viqi Shesh to Denua Ku, moments before her suicide|The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand}}\nWith no other choice except to obey, Shesh accompanied Denua Ku, ten Yuuzhan Vong and two dying voxyn to the ruined surface of Coruscant. It was soon clear that Jedi, or at least a team of insurgents, were present on the planet. [[Raglath Nur]], the Yuuzhan Vong warrior in charge of the hunting party, continually called upon Shesh for advice; the former senator used her rudimentary knowledge of explosive devices and Coruscanti architecture to guide Nur and his warriors, all the time fearful and searching for a means of escape. Eventually, the party found themselves on the trail of what seemed to be, according the behavior of the voxyn, a group of Force-sensitives. Forced to run alongside the hunting party, Shesh became increasingly incensed about her dire predicament. Before long, she noticed a room full of dead bodies floating in stagnant liquid. Perceiving that one of the corpses was in fact a living Human feigning death as the search party passed, Shesh ordered Denua Ku to drag the [[Hasray Terson|young male]] out of the liquid for interrogation. Shesh demanded to know where the Jedi were; the young man claimed that he knew nothing and in his panic passed her a small remote, before the voxyn scented their prey and the hunting party went on the move. Denua Ku snapped the young man's neck and Shesh was left with a remote for which she did not know the purpose. Shesh was forced to pocket the device and follow Nur and his warriors into the ruins of an [[Elegaic Fabrications]] manufacturing plant.<ref name=\"el2\" />\n[[File:Coruscant27ABY.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shesh died on the terraformed galactic capital, Coruscant, having helped deliver it to the Yuuzhan Vong.]]\n\nInside the plant, the hunting party discovered the presence of a Force-sensitive. Observing from a distance, Shesh watched in horror as a giant figure dispatched a voxyn with a [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetically]] hurled block of machinery, before a wave of Force-induced despair and rage assaulted her psyche. In the throes of loathing and pain, Shesh listened as the hunting party met its demise at the hands of the unknown assailant, who utilized several lightsabers to dissect them. Despite the compulsion issued through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to attack the being, Shesh's instinctive desire for survival triggered her desire to flee. Pursued by the Force-sensitive, Shesh escaped the manufacturing plant in a state of pure terror. Dashing through ruined buildings with her pursuer close behind, Shesh came face to face with two fugitives who held her at blaster point and discussed killing her and eating her remains. The not so distant pursuer caught up with her, however, and Shesh scrambled to escape while the two fugitives were torn to pieces by his lightsabers. The former senator escaped into a maintenance shaft and climbed as fast as she could. Compelled by her fear and terror, Shesh managed to elude her pursuit before collapsing exhausted in one of the tunnels and falling to sleep for a time. When she awoke she activated the remote and discovered that it provided her with a map of her surroundings and directions to an unknown object. Shesh decided that her best chances of survival lay with the object and set off for her goal.<ref name=\"el2\" />\n\nShesh arrived eventually at a [[Terson family|family's]] abandoned apartment. Formerly a place of luxury, it was decayed and derelict following the orbital bombardment of Coruscant. The former Kuati senator explored the apartment and used the remote to discover the identity of the unknown object. When a hidden room opened and she discovered a private spacecraft, the ''[[Ugly Truth]]'', intact and filled with [[Ration bar/Legends|ration bars]], Shesh could not believe her luck. Over the next days, the former senator worked at removing the debris that blocked the ''Ugly Truth''{{'s}} escape chute and studied the starship's controls, eager and desperate to escape the ruins of Coruscant. Always cautious to go about her days quietly in case she attracted undue attention, especially from the coralskippers she observed on patrol in the skies, Shesh was shocked when she was accosted by Denua Ku in the apartment. Ku revealed that he had tracked her down by means of an organic subcutaneous implant known as a [[nisbat]], which had been inserted into Shesh's body in case she escaped. Having assumed the warrior dead at the hands of the rampaging Force-sensitive, the former senator was forced to lie to explain why she had not contacted the Yuuzhan Vong since her disappearance. Denua Ku did not believe her claims that she had been unable to do so and ordered her to accompany him and a new party of warriors to kill the Force-sensitive before returning to Domain Dal in orbit. Shesh abandoned the apartment, dejected and promising to herself that she would return.<ref name=\"el2\" />\n\nThe lone voxyn that Ku had acquired for his new hunting party was soon on the trail of the Force-sensitive. In a large chamber, Shesh watched as the voxyn discovered the giant [[Irek Ismaren|Force-sensitive male]] and led the warriors to face their foe. Twenty-five warriors went up against the man; within seconds eight were dead. As Shesh watched two new figures approaching the giant Force-sensitive, however, she was shocked to discover that they were none other than Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker. The former senator realized that whoever the victor was in the impending three-way battle, she would be the loser. As she escaped, however, she was seized by [[Kell Tainer]] and [[Garik Loran]], two New Republic operatives who had accompanied the Skywalkers to Coruscant. Shesh was put in [[Stun cuffs|binders]] and had her remote confiscated, before she was forced to follow Loran and Tainer as they located a dormant [[EVS Construction Droid|construction droid]] and activated it in order to help the Jedi. In the resulting chaos, Shesh made her escape. She moved up a floor to find Denua Ku impaled by a metal bar and still alive. Laughing at the warrior's request that she tell the Yuuzhan Vong that he had died well, Shesh fled the scene for the ''Ugly Truth''.<ref name=\"el2\" />\n\nShe was soon able to find a way to cut her binders and made her way to the apartment where, to her horror, she discovered that the starship was gone. In its place was an [[Air taxi/Legends|air taxi]] and a mocking note from Tainer and Loran, who had arrived there ahead of her and left a pile of rations. The distraught ex-senator collapsed in tears. For a time she remained in the ruins of the apartment bemoaning her misfortune, until the ''Ugly Truth'' came into view outside the apartment, hovering near a shattered [[Viewport/Legends|viewport]]. Shesh realized that the Skywalkers, who were onboard the spacecraft, would grant her mercy if she begged. Preparing to board the spacecraft and seek clemency, the Kuati woman was shocked when Denua Ku once again appeared behind her, mortally wounded and vowing that he would kill her. The former senator for Kuat realized that she could never reach the spacecraft hatch in time and, determined to exercise the last power she had remaining, voiced her opinion that her death rested in the hands of one person alone&mdash;herself.

With regards to the New Republic Defense Force's deception of the Advisory Council and her brief alliance with Commodore Brand, Shesh purported to be operating in collusion with the military while she in fact utilized the situation to her advantage and approached the Hutts via Golga Besadii Fir.<ref name=\"aoc2\" /> The senator ensured that she kept a distance between herself and the evidence of her collaboration, making use of various front businesses and bank accounts and entrusting Victor Pomt and a coterie of assassins with the groundwork.<ref name=\"sbs\" /><ref name=\"eov2\" /> Shesh attempted to retain some control over the process of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, such as when she withheld the information of Centerpoint Station's continued deactivation in order to slow Warmaster Lah's advance upon the Core Worlds.<ref name=\"bp\" /> She attempted to bring the weight of the New Republic government against the Jedi Order and utilized all means possible to split the Senate and capitalize on anti-Jedi sentiment, making use of her talent for oratory and rhetoric to achieve her goals.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> Shesh grew frustrated, fearful and despairing when matters failed to proceed as she intended,<ref name=\"el2\" /><ref name=\"sbs\" /><ref name=\"r\" /> but prided herself on her ability to outmaneuver her allies and opponents in order to ensure her survival.<ref name=\"el1\" /> As events progressed beyond her control and the senator found herself immersed in subterfuge and assassination, Shesh nevertheless brought her intellect to bear in situations that were foreign to her, engineering two elaborate plans to kidnap Ben Skywalker.<ref name=\"el2\" /><ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nShesh was also a woman who delighted in luxury and fine living, having been born into a royal Kuati family and subsequently grown up in high society.<ref name=\"el2\" /><ref name=\"njosb\" /> This led to a materialistic streak&mdash;Shesh enjoyed decorating her workplace and apartment with antiques and plush furnishings and was often seen in high quality garments.<ref name=\"el2\" /><ref name=\"aoc2\" /> Shesh similarly ensured that she was seen to travel in style, possessing a sleek yacht, the ''Wicked Pleasure'', of which she made use during the Battle of Coruscant.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> She comported herself with pride and dignity, aware that she was naturally beautiful in terms of Human standards and was also flirtatious at times, such as when she dealt with the mercenary Reck Desh.<ref name=\"el2\" /><ref name=\"aoc1\" /> Even at her nadir, during her desperate flight across Coruscant, Shesh attempt to retain the dignity of her Kuati descent. Her pride also extended to a sense of superiority,<ref name=\"el2\" /> as well as a vengeful streak which manifested itself when she felt wronged, such as when she took delight in abducting Ben Skywalker in retaliation for his father's opposition toward her in the New Republic Senate.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> Shesh also had a taste for attractive young males, whom she often treated as her playthings.<ref name=\"el2\" /> She disliked interacting with \"inferior\" males due to her upbringing in Kuati society. The politician's real attraction was toward beings of power. When faced even with members of other species, such as the Bothan Borsk Fey'lya or the heavily scarred Yuuzhan Vong warmaster, Shesh found herself attracted to them due to the power they wielded, a characteristic that caused the Kuati woman some secret shame.<ref name=\"sbs\" /> Despite a youth spent in luxury and spending much of her adult life as a political figure, Shesh was not above combat and feats of physical exertion; she fled the deranged Irek Ismaren, vanishing into the Coruscant underworld and was also able to best a Noghri,<ref name=\"sbs\" /> traditionally recognized as skilled fighters,<ref name=\"negtas\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Alien Species]]''</ref> with a vibroblade.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:ViqiSheshSketch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sketch card of Viqi Shesh from Star Wars Galaxy Series 4]]\n{{Quote|I always try to write two sides in pursuit of conflicting goals.|Troy Denning on writing ''Star by Star'', a novel in which Shesh featured prominently|url=http://www.theforce.net/books/unjoh/interviews/denningtos.html}}\nViqi Shesh was a significant character in [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|The New Jedi Order]] series of novels and was developed by several different authors throughout her character's story arc.<ref name=\"sbs\" /><ref name=\"bp\" /><ref name=\"aoc1\" /><ref name=\"el1\" /> Although introduced in [[Michael A. Stackpole|Michael Stackpole's]] ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]'', Shesh's character was further expanded upon, and her nature as a collaborator revealed, in [[James Luceno]]'s [[Agents of Chaos Duology|Agents of Chaos duology]]. In a scene set in Kuat City during which Reck Desh meets with an individual disguised as a Kuati telbun in ''Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial'', it is not specifically stated in the novel whether or not this individual is Shesh; this was only confirmed in ''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]'' and the ''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''. In ''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]'' and ''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]'', two other novels in which Shesh featured as a supporting character, her [[Treason/Legends|treasonous]] actions against the New Republic were closely followed, acting as a source of dramatic irony as other characters remained unaware of her true loyalties.\n\n''Balance Point'', published in [[2000]], the year after [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] was released, features a scene during which Jacen Solo compares Shesh to [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] in the days of his rise to power, reflecting new links between the [[prequel trilogy]] and the [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] novels. In his [[Enemy Lines duology|''Enemy Lines'' duology]], [[Aaron Allston]] brought Shesh's arc to its conclusion, with the former senator's suicide occurring at the finale of the Mission to Coruscant section. Her prominent role in the series earned her an entry, as mentioned, in ''The New Essential Guide to Characters'', written by [[Daniel Wallace]], as well as in the [[The Official Star Wars Fact File 108|108th]] installment of ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]''. In ''The New Essential Guide to Characters'', Shesh, portrayed in the novels as an attractive and refined woman, was illustrated by [[Michael Sutfin]], providing the only canonical image of the senator to date.\n\nA mistake was made in \"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" when it stated that, during Viqi Shesh's second attempt to kidnap Ben Skywalker, Mara Jade shot down the Senator's ship.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Recovery]]'' {{Voice}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Ylesia]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Allies'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Senator/Legends|Senator]] of [[Kuat sector/Legends|Kuat sector]]\n|years=[[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]]&mdash;[[26 ABY]]\n|before=[[Haydnat Treen]]\n|after=Eventually Haynat Treen}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20021003recovery|text=Making a Full ''Recovery''|int=Making a Full Recovery|archivedate=20091124204313}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|57|MAR10, ''Mara Jade Skywalker''}}\n*{{FFCite|108|SHE1-2, ''Senator Viqi Shesh''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|tsavonglah|Lah, Warmaster Tsavong|archivedate=20100210004630}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Viqi Shesh\n|de=Viqi Shesh\n|es=Viqi Shesh\n|ru=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0428\u0435\u0448\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shesh, Viqi}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kuati]]\n[[Category:New Republic Senators]]\n[[Category:Yuuzhan Vong collaborators]]"}}}]}}}}
