Born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]] in [[3670 BBY]], Kimble attended [[University of Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant University's]] [[First Republic Medical Academy of Coruscant|prestigious medical program]] on the Republic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] before graduating with high honors as a licensed [[xenopathologist]]. However, Kimble gave up the life of a doctor in the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] to bring medical care to the people of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]], taking on the name \"Doc\" and traveling the galaxy for the next five [[Standard year/Legends|years]].\n\nDoc's escapades often saw him leave a trail of jilted lovers and furious criminals in his wake as Doc took it upon himself to right wrongs when he saw them, though after an encounter with a trio of [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lords]] on the planet [[Little Kessel/Legends|Little Kessel]], Doc joined the [[Balmorran resistance]] as an unofficial member and worked as a doctor as the resistance fighters [[Battle of Balmorra (Great Galactic Wars)|battled]] the Empire's occupation of the planet [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]]. When the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knight known as the Hero of Tython came to Balmorra on a [[Mission to Balmorra (Hunt for the Sith Emperor)|covert mission]], Doc found himself helping the Knight and the Republic in securing a prototype cloaking device, and he decided to join the Jedi's crew when the Hero of Tython left Balmorra. Along with the Jedi's other allies, Doc aided the Hero's efforts to [[Hunt for the Sith Emperor|capture]] the [[Tenebrae|Sith Emperor]] and then to prevent the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] from destroying the galaxy with a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] [[Sith Emperor's ritual|ritual]]. After the Hero [[Dromund Kaas operation|defeated]] the Emperor in a final battle, Doc and the other members of the Knight's crew were awarded the [[Cross of Glory]], the Republic's highest honor.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Born on Ralltiir, graduated Coruscant University.

The Mandalorians promptly attacked the [[Unidentified Hutt's palace|Hutt's palace]], and Doc managed to recover the medpacs and a few rare gems from the palace in the chaos. Doc donated the medpacs to all of the hospitals in the disaster zone, an action that saved thousands of lives.<ref name=\"Doctor Knockout\" />\n\n[[File:Prudy.png|thumb|right|170px|Prudy, Doc's fianc\u00e9e]]\nDuring his travels, Doc spent a short amount of time practicing orthodontia on the planet [[Rodia/Legends|Rodia]],<ref name=\"Healthy teeth\">{{TORcite|type=message|Healthy teeth|Doc}}</ref> as well as a brief period impersonating a member of the [[Imperial Medical Corps]] on the Imperial-occupied planet [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]],<ref name=\"Codex\" /> and had other adventures on planets such as [[Taris/Legends|Taris]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Doc also worked with the organization known as the [[Red Band Rebels]] on the planet [[Cadinth/Legends|Cadinth]] for a time.<ref name=\"Codex\" /> In [[3644 BBY]], Doc encountered a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] doctor named [[Prudy]] on the planet [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]], and the two began a romantic relationship that soon resulted in their engagement. Doc even used the credits from his spice scam to purchase Prudy a [[Prudy's hospital|hospital]] on the planet [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], but Prudy's rushing of their wedding gave Doc cold feet and he left her at the altar.<ref name=\"Best Intentions\" /> Around the same time, a trio of jealous crime lords on Ord Mantell supposedly placed a bounty on Doc, which some believed was the reason for his departure. However, Doc's adventuring and his obsession with undermining tyrants and despots across the galaxy came to end on the planet [[Little Kessel/Legends|Little Kessel]], where he crossed the [[Kaleesh/Legends|Kaleesh]] warlord [[Xim'tahal]] the Defaced and was nearly killed as a result. After that encounter, Doc joined up with the [[Balmorran resistance]] on the planet [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]],<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> where he aided the resistance fighters unofficially as a doctor in their fight against the Sith Empire.<ref name=\"Twitter Balmorra\" />\n\n===Working with the resistance===\n{{Quote|Honey, I do the work of ten medics&mdash;and that's on a bad day.|Doc|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[File:Archiban_Frodrick_Kimble.png|left|thumb|Doc during his travels with the Jedi|284x284px]]\nWhile the [[Balmorran Arms Factory]] was still under the control of the resistance, Doc ran a hospital within the weapons factory, becoming friends with various Balmorrans such as [[Remmy]]<ref name=\"Spoils of War\" /> and [[Madel]].<ref name=\"Tactical Advantages\">{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Tactical Advantages|Balmorra}}</ref> However, the resistance was later driven out of the factory, forcing Doc to relocate his operations to a resistance hospital that had been established in an [[Farnel Research Facility Industrial Complex|old research facility]] within the former [[Bioengineering/Legends|genetic research]] compound known as [[Bugtown]], where the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]] had established a [[Farnel Outpost|forward command post]] as part of their renewed efforts to aid the resistance. Doc continued his efforts to heal the wounded, aiding resistance members, civilians, and soldiers, though he was the only trained doctor at the facility. However, the hospital's operations were disrupted when Imperial forces intercepted a shipment of trauma kits en route to the facility.<ref name=\"Lives in the Balance\" />\n\nNot long afterwards, the facility came under attack by a swarm of insectoid [[Colicoid/Legends|Colicoids]], forcing Doc to send out a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress signal]] that was answered by the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] known as the [[Hero of Tython]], who was responding to the signal in order to gain the trust of the resistance and therefore further the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi's]] own [[Mission to Balmorra (Hunt for the Sith Emperor)|mission]] on Balmorra. The Jedi and a companion cut a path through the attacking Colicoids, but Doc alerted the pair to an incoming nest of Colicoids and warned the Jedi to close the insectoids' tunnels before racing to the secure area in order to protect his patients.<ref name=\"Lives in the Balance\" />\n\n===Later adventures===\nDuring the [[Eternal Empire conquest]], the Hero went missing and Doc believed that they had gone off on a top secret mission. Eventually, he became separated from Kira Carsen and Scourge on [[Begeren]] and started to look for Jedi in hopes of finding his former companions. His travels led him to [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]] and a hidden [[Jedi Colony]] under [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Gnost-Dural]]. Despite being a latecomer to the recently-established settlement, Doc was happily welcomed and joined as a full-time doctor of the staff.<ref name=\"Inflection Point\">{{TORcite|exp=kotet|type=faction|Republic|Inflection Point|Odessen}}</ref>\n\nYears later, during the [[Invasion of Ossus]] and start of a [[Third Galactic War|new conflict]] between Empire and Republic, Doc and [[Nadia Grell]] led the evacuation efforts of the colony.
