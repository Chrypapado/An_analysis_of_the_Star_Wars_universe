Eventually attaining the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] after passing his [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]], Cros began independent study on the path of the [[Jedi Consular]]; particularly the way of the [[Jedi Diplomat|diplomat]].\n\nIn [[47 BBY/Legends|47 BBY]], the [[Nyriaanan|native species]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nyriaan/Legends|Nyriaan]] staged an uprising against offworld settlers; the latter of which made a plea to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] for assistance. In response, the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] dispatched Cros to hammer out a truce between the two groups, hoping to bring a swift end to the conflict. Despite Cros' diplomatic abilities, he was unable to end the conflict until [[43 BBY/Legends|43 BBY]]. During the time Cros spent amongst the Nyriaanans, he became enamored with their culture and spirit, and refused to report back to the Council or Coruscant after the truce went into effect. Instead, Cros was appointed as [[Jedi Watchman/Legends|Jedi Watchman]] for the planet, as the Council believed it would be useful to have an envoy on the planet in the event that another conflict erupted there in the future.<ref name=\"GOI\" />\n\n[[36 BBY/Legends|Seven years]] later, the natives rose up again, and this time Cros was at the forefront of their rebellion. The High Council declared that he had gone [[Dark Jedi/Legends|rogue]], but refrained from sending any other Jedi to stop him. The conflict eventually ended in [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]] when the [[Luire Accord]] resulted in the creation of a new planetary government&mdash;the [[Nyriaan Concord]]. Cros became the leader of the native delegation to the Concord, but he found the political body to be corrupt and ill-prepared. He soon left in disgust and traveled to the unexplored regions of Nyriaan, accompanied by a large number of native followers.<ref name=\"GOI\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDespite adopting the culture of the native Nyriaanans, Cros carried on a belief in Jedi philosophy. However, in the fight against the oppressors of Nyriaan, Cros was prepared to do whatever it took to win, and was willing to utilize the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] if doing so would serve the greater good.<ref name=\"GOI\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy of Intrigue]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Amar Cros\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cros, Amar}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Consulars]]\n[[Category:Jedi Watchmen]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nyriaan residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
