Originally a street fighter, he swindled tourists on [[Ord Mantell]] until he had enough [[Currency|money]] to buy his [[cantina]] from the [[Vriichon brothers]]. Despite his desire to enforce certain rules, his establishment was known for its occasional outbreaks of shocking violence, and even Chalmun himself had shady dealings with local [[gangster]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n===From swindling to bartending===\n[[File:OrdMantellCity.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ord Mantell, where Chalmun made money as a con artist]]\nChalmun was a [[Wookiee]],<ref name=\"Adventures\" /> a [[species]] of tall, [[hair]]y [[humanoid]]s [[Homeworld|hailing]] from the [[planet]] [[Kashyyyk]].<ref name=\"Alien Archive\">''[[Star Wars: Alien Archive]]''</ref> Originally a street thug, [[Gender|he]] spent a few [[Standard year|years]] [[Con artist|swindling]] unfortunate tourists in the [[casino]]s of [[Ord Mantell]]. Eventually, he found his way to the [[Star|suns]]-scorched, [[desert]] planet [[Tatooine]], which was dominated by the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. There, in the [[city]] of [[Mos Eisley]], he bought the [[Vriichon brothers]]' illegal [[spice]] den, located next to the city's [[\"Community\" junk yard|\"community\" junk yard]] and only a stone's throw from the local [[spaceport]]. Soon after the sale, the Vriichons vanished, perhaps fearing the Wookiee's reaction upon discovering the many [[Death|bodies]] they had [[Burial|buried]] in the basement.<ref name=\"SWCL\" />\n\n===Cantina owner===\n{{Quote|Chalmun's Cantina was better than Jabba's.

He was, however, very insistent that payment be on time, lest he lose patience and decide to throw them out by force.<ref name=\"kloohorn\">{{Shortstory|story=The Kloo Horn Cantina Caper|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\nFor some time, Chalmun employed the [[Rodian]] [[musician]] [[Doda Bodonawieedo]] to play in the cantina.

He ensured his new house band that it was safe for them to play there, and that he would protect them from the bounty hunter [[Greedo]], whom they had discredited in the [[eye]]s of Jabba the Hutt. Despite that, he almost immediately left them in Wuher's care and went home.<ref name=\"Not For Nothing\" />\n\n[[File:Ackmena_and_Chalmun.png|thumb|left|250px|Chalmun hearing Ackmena out in his office]]\nLater on the same day he hired the band,<ref name=\"Not For Nothing\" /> Chalmun retired to his office, where Ackmena attempted to negotiate better working [[Standard hour|hours]]. Meanwhile, in the main room, a scuffle occurred between a blond young [[human]] and the violent [[Aqualish]] [[Ponda Baba]]. As it turned out, the human was [[Luke Skywalker]],<ref name=\"SWCL\" /> who went on to become a hero of the Rebel Alliance and a mystical [[Jedi]] warrior.<ref name=\"ECUC\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref>\n\nAt some point after the [[Battle of Yavin]], Chalmun reinforced the cantina's security, adding a button the bartender could use to summon an array of automated [[blaster]]s from the ceiling. At the time, the daytime bartender was a man named [[Shrem]], who feared his employer's reaction should he ever allow a robbery to take place or break a deal with a paying customer. The man, however, ended up doing the latter, but did not suffer Chalmun's wrath, as he fell into a trap sprung by a [[Chelli Lona Aphra|former partner]] of his and was hurled in Jabba the Hutt's [[rancor]] pit.<ref name=\"Aphra Annual 3\">[[Doctor Aphra Annual 3|''Doctor Aphra Annual'' 3]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|If word gets out the cantina's been robbed&mdash;or worse yet, we been breaking deals with payin' customers?
