She's cranky sometimes. But very good looking. Not something you could relate to.|Kyle Katarn|Dark Forces: Rebel Agent}}\n'''Jan Ors''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaanian]] intelligence operative who began her work as an agent for the terrorist organization [[Justice Action Network]]. As the undercover agent Jan Strange, she then shifted to helping the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], becoming one of their trusted operatives.\n\nOrs was instrumental in recruiting [[Kyle Katarn]] to the Alliance and together they worked on many missions for the Alliance and later the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. The two would later become romantically involved. Ors continued her work for the New Republic by joining [[Alpha Blue]], a secret intelligence organization, that she eventually took over from [[Hiram Drayson]]. There she worked for the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]] against the [[Yuuzhan Vong]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Youth===\nJan Ors' mother was a choreographer for [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan's]] premier ballet company, and her father was an aerospace engineer; Ors learned both of these arts, although her mother could be with her only when she wasn't rehearsing. She learned from her mother, one of the few remaining believers in [[the Force/Legends|the Force]], that the Force worked in mysterious ways. Since when she was four years old, her mother noticed that she preferred doing things alone and never asked for help.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\">''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]''</ref> Her parents also were instrumental in [[Earnst Kamiel]]'s establishing of the [[Justice Action Network]], an anti-[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] terrorist organization whose initials (JAN) were partly chosen to honor the Ors' daughter. However, Ors did not stay with the JAN, instead striking out on her own path.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" />\n\n===Alias and espionage===\n{{Quote|Captain Strange is almost something of a legend in the Rebellion, even though she has never worn an Alliance uniform.|[[General/Legends|General]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]]|Cracken's Rebel Operatives}}\n[[File:Jan_Strange.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jan Ors, disguised as Jan Strange.]]\nShe began her career by infiltrating [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] under the pseudonym Jan Strange.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /> Once she was well placed in the Surveillance section of Intell, she contacted the [[Alliance Intelligence]], providing them with invaluable counterintelligence and performing sabotage and covert extractions.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /><ref name=\"Cracken's Rebel Operatives\">''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]''</ref> She first encountered the Imperial [[Cadet/Legends|cadet]] [[Kyle Katarn]] while working in Intell, though neither left an impression on the other at the time.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" />\n\nShe maintained a very delicate balance of providing intelligence to the Alliance while simultaneously performing her duties as an Imperial Intelligence officer. Surveillance section came to value her ability to pinpoint the right subjects for observation, and often sent her to the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] where corruption was rampant. This \"talent\" was the result of Ors arranging to have targets planted by the Alliance, whom she would then observe, capture, and interrogate; they would then be set free, and she would fake a \"termination during interrogation\" to cover their escape.<ref name=\"Cracken's Rebel Operatives\" />\n\nUnfortunately for the Alliance, her cover required her to sometimes act against them, even sometimes going so far as to sacrifice clumsy and careless agents. Despite having never worn the uniform of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, her difficult assignment earned her a [[Captain/Legends|Captain's]] rank and a [[Nebula Award|Nebula for Bravery]] ''in absentia'', along with an almost legendary stature among other Rebels.<ref name=\"Cracken's Rebel Operatives\" />\n\n===Rebel Alliance===\n{{Quote|What would you do without me, Kyle?''\"<br />\"''I'd be a content old man.|Jan Ors and Kyle Katarn|audio=ContentOldMan-JKDF2.ogg|Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II}}\nOrs did not remain in her Jan Strange guise for long, and was soon performing missions as part of the Rebel Alliance itself. In [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]], she participated in a mission to steal prime-grade [[Fuel/Legends|fuel]] [[Slug/Legends|slugs]] from Imperial forces in the jungles of [[Oulanne/Legends|Oulanne]]. In the course of the mission, her leg was injured, and it became infected. Her teammates fled with her to [[Pellezara station]] in the [[Duro system]], where they hid her beneath the deckplates of their [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] while they all disembarked in search of medical supplies. [[Tarrin Datch]], a seventeen-year old son of the [[Datch family|owners]] of the station, found her while replacing the ship's [[gravity disk]]s during routine restocking. In a delirium brought on by the strange alien infection, Ors told the boy her name and the cargo the ship was carrying.<ref name=\"Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back\">''[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref>\n\nSometime between her service as Jan Strange and 1 BBY, Ors lost the use of her right [[hand]] and had it replaced with a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] prosthesis.<ref>''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' establishes it was a cybernetic replacement. It is not present in the image of her in ''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]'', but is visible in an image of her in ''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]'' set during the Danuta mission.</ref>\n\nWhen Imperial forces entered the Duro system, Datch, an accomplished [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], took action to save the strikingly beautiful woman, undocking the ship, and proceeding to fly it in a manner more befitting a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] than a freighter, outmaneuvering the [[Gamma-class assault shuttle/Legends|''Gamma''-class assault shuttle]] that was pursuing them. When he made it to open space, he hypered to an outer-system station that was equipped with a well-equipped medicenter, where he stabilized Ors. Unable to return to Pellezara station, and knowing the fuel slugs needed to be delivered to the Alliance, Ors disclosed the location of the [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] base to Datch, who took them both there. There, Datch joined the Rebellion and began training to become a fighter pilot,<ref name=\"EGTW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref> while Ors went on to other missions;<ref name=\"Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back\" /> one of them stationed her at a Rebel base on the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] [[AX-456]].<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\" />\n\n[[File:JanOrs1_DFSftE.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jan Ors meets Kyle Katarn.]]\nIt was not long before the Empire located the AX-456 base and invaded; coincidentally, Kyle Katarn was the cadet commander in charge of the mission. At one point, Ors and Katarn saw each other, and though neither remembered their brief past encounters, both felt a spark of distant recognition. Katarn spared the lives of the Rebel group she was in, which fled the asteroid. It would not be their last encounter. <ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\" />\n\nShe was assigned the ''[[Truly Sorry]'' and came aboard the ''[[Star of Empire]]''; she kept the droid [[A-Cee]], who brought deocumentation from the [[Subjugation of Sulon]], in her cabin, and operated with [[Ris Waller]] and [[Rosco Ross]] in an off-limits section of the ship; then Ors again encountered Katarn in the [[Corellia Room]] and exchanged looks. Seeing him, she coordinated on the fly his capture with the others: he fell into the hands of Rosco and was shoved into their storeroom. Ors told her comrades that in their previous encounter he had let them live, and despite their scepticism, she decided to repay that debt, for the moment. Katarn however wanted some answers and she agreed to meet again.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\" />\n\nJan waited for Katarn at the library and used the [[virtual reality]] service that put her in a ballet, practicing the art she learned from her mother, and Katarn who showed up then, was genuinely impressed. Exchanging some words about their past and upgringing in the [[cafeteria]], Katarn asked why the Rebels killed [[Morgan Katarn|his father]], and gained her interest mentioning the name [[Sulon]], and his surname. Ors brought him to her cabin where [[A-Cee]] was; at that moment she had to override A-Cee's mechanism, who was programmed to self-destruct in the presence of an Imperial Officer. She revealed to him that the Empire that he is serving, is actually doing atrocities, and her job as a Rebel agent has to divulge them to the citizens; showing footage from A-Cee's memory, it was revealed to him that his father was actually a Rebel, and proved that the Empire was lying about him. Katarn demanded to know what happened to him and how she died, and she allowe A-Cee to show him the footage of his severed head. Katarn thanked her for showing him the painful truth and before walking away, he removed his decoration; a gesture that Jen never forgot.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\" />\n\nTwo [[standard day/Legends|days]] before their scheduled departure, Jan moved to the liner's hangar to do some maintenance on the ''Truly Sorry'', as its [[Hyperdrive motivator/Legends|hyperspace motivator]] displayed false readings. Two hours of a long and boring job of removing a plate, disconnecting and removing the lower motivator housing, the 100-kilos casing dropped into her hands. She realised her mistake for not using a floor jack; for some moments she was unable to move or let it drop, when Katarn showed up, and helped her with gently lowering it to the floor. He then offered to help with her work; Jan already nervous, wanted to chase him away but accepted out of pity; she would work on the wiring harness while Kyle ran the diagnostic checks. Jan couldn't but admire Kyle's knowledge and instinct, quickly determining the problem while she would need hours to determine. She was entering the ship to find a replacement for the damaged [[sensor/Legends|sensor package]] when Kyle finally expressed his desire to join the Alliance, proved by the commitment that Jan read in his eyes. She offered to take him to people who had the authority to recruit him.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\" />\n\nJan never realised that her movements and actions, including her meeting with Katarn, were followed and recorded by a [[bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] who was making his living on that very ship, and sold this information to an Imperial official. Indeed, soon her sleep was interrupted by a call from Katarn, tell her that someone, perhaps even [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Dol Donar II]] himself, who was onboard, knew about them, and they would be caught at any moment. Jan buried her surprise and told him to meet on the hangar deck, as did Ross and Waller. She took A-Cee with her and exited the hatch to a hallway when they were apprehended by teh bounty hunter [[Slyder]] and Imperial military personnel. Jan returned the fire and started running, but A-Cee stayed behind and was shot.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\" />\n\nOnce they uncovered the presence of Rebels aboard the ''Star'', Katarn defected with Ors.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\" />\n\nJan Ors met with [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] and persuaded her to hire Kyle Katarn as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] and [[Commando/Legends|commando]], going so far as to lie in her reports to give credence to her faith in Katarn's trustworthiness.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /> Ors provided briefings from [[Alliance High Command/Legends|Alliance Command]] to Katarn and served as pilot of their ship, the ''[[Moldy Crow/Legends|Moldy Crow]]'', in their pivotal missions to [[Mission to Danuta|capture]] the [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] for the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]] on [[Danuta]] and later to thwart the [[Dark Trooper Project]].\n\n====Dark Trooper campaign====\n[[File:Jan_Ors.png|thumb|left|Jan Ors during the Dark Trooper campaign.]]\nBy that time she became one of the few people Katarn trusted, and also one of the few people he could count on to help him get out of sticky situations; Katarn requested to Mon Mothma that Ors accompany him for the campaign.\n\nOrs, providing the intelligence for Katarn and guiding him during his missions, traced [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Rebus (Galactic Empire)|Rebus]] based on an [[Imperial Repeater Rifle]] found by Katarn while [[Mission to Talay|investigating]] the [[Attack on Tak Base|massacre]] on [[Talay/Legends|Talay]]. She later found out that [[Phrik/Legends|phrik]] that Katarn [[Mission to Fest (Galactic Civil War)|found]] on [[Fest/Legends|Fest]] originated from the [[Gromas Mines]]. Ors flew Katarn to [[Gromas 16]] where he [[Mission to Gromas|managed]] to destroy the facility.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Dark Forces\">''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces]]''</ref>\n\nAfter a brief delay, having to drop Katarn to [[Orinackra]] in order to [[Mission to Orinackra|free]] [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]] from the prison, Ors was informed that the Dark Trooper project was financed by smugglers and an unidentified kingpin who was no other than [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]]. Ors suggested to Katarn that he should put a tracking device on a smuggler ship on [[Cal-Seti]], which led them to [[Anteevy/Legends|Anteevy]]. There Katarn [[Mission to Anteevy|destroyed]] the [[Imperial Robotics Construction Facility Ice Station Beta|robotics facility]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Dark Forces\" />\n\nOrs investigated flights to and from [[Gromas 16]] and Anteevy and found that they were all led to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Ors thought that there would be found some Imperial Navigational devices or charts that the smugglers hired by the Empire used, which would help Katarn and her find the location of the ''[[Arc Hammer]]''.\n\nDuring their [[Mission to Nar Shaddaa (Dark Trooper campaign)|adventures]] while on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], Katarn found a [[nava card]] but the ''Crow'' was captured and both were brought onto the [[Star Jewel/Legends|''Star Jewel'']]. Ors was held as a bargaining chip against the Alliance by Jabba, until she was again rescued by Katarn, who had to go through many extremes to save her, including defeating a [[Kell dragon/Legends|Kell dragon]] with his bare hands.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Dark Forces\" />\n\nOnce free, Jan Ors realized that only the [[Imperial Security Operations]] building in [[Galactic City|Imperial City]] hosted a reader that could interpret the nava card Katarn obtained. Jan Ors approached with the Moldy Crow in a plaza where she left Katarn. While Katarn managed to reach the ISO building Jan Ors was spotted and attacked by [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighters]]. A distress call reached Katarn's comlink on his way back and ran to see what happened. Ors was gone when Katarn returned to the place he was landed, instead finding [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] waiting for him. After both Katarn and Ors were finished with their, encounters, Ors approached Katarn and the two left [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Dark Forces\" />\n\nJan Ors, based on the output of the nava card, understood that only [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] knew the ''Arc Hammer''{{'s}} location at each given time since it was making leaps to hyperspace to keep its status secret. The only way to reach the factory was via the ''Executor'' which was supplied from [[Fuel Station Ergo/Legends|Ergo]]. Ors's final part on the campaign was to leave Katarn on Ergo, and from that point, Katarn single-handedly finished his mission, boarding ''Executor'', the ''Arc Hammer'' and putting an end to the Dark Trooper threat.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Dark Forces\" />\n\n===New Republic===\n{{Quote|Whenever I need to find you you're always in some kind of trouble.|Jan Ors to Kyle Katarn|Star Wars: Jedi Knight}}\n[[File:Kylejan.jpg|thumb|right|Ors and Katarn on Sulon.]]\nOrs and Katarn's relationship continued to deepen, but Ors feared allowing Katarn to get too close.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /> This changed as she accompanied Katarn on their quest for the [[Valley of the Jedi]] on [[Ruusan/Legends|Ruusan]], where she was captured by the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]]. Jerec asked Katarn (who came very close to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]) to execute her. He refused, defeating Jerec and sealing the Valley.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II\" /> Ors and Katarn then declared their love for one another.<ref name=\"Dark Forces: Jedi Knight\">''[[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight]]''</ref> She later continued to turn down Katarn's proposals of marriage, however, not wanting to get married simply because of the fear that each day could be their last.<ref name=\"Equals and Opposites\">\"[[Equals & Opposites]]\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Janandboc.jpg|thumb|left|Ors, a prisoner of Jerec and his [[Seven Dark Jedi|Dark Jedi]].]]\nOn Mon Mothma's recommendation, Ors joined [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Hiram Drayson]]'s secret [[Alpha Blue]] organization. There, she helped expose the [[Yevetha]]ns and kept tabs on the [[Order of the Canted Circle]], the [[Azurite Society of Lords]], and [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Octavian Grant]],<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /> who was allegedly retired on [[Rathalay]].<ref name=\"Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals\">\"[[Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals]]\"</ref> She also accompanied Katarn, who had returned to his mercenary ways after slipping to the dark side on [[Dromund Kaas]], on a number of off-the-record missions against the [[Imperial Remnant]] in their new ship, the ''[[Raven's Claw]]''.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith\">''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Jantavion.jpg|thumb|right|Ors, captured by Tavion Axmis and Desann.]]\nWhile following up a lead on the [[Reborn]], a deadly [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] force of the [[Empire Reborn]] faction, Ors was captured by a failed student of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[Jedi Praxeum]], [[Desann]], and his apprentice [[Tavion Axmis]]. They pretended to kill her, and Katarn heard the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] sound without being able to help her. Grieved by her apparent loss, he returned to the Valley of the Jedi to regain his Jedi powers, allowing Desann to find the Valley's location and use its powers to fuel the Reborn. It was only much later that Axmis confessed to Katarn that they only feigned Ors' execution, and the couple was ultimately reunited before Desann met his doom.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast\">''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast]]''</ref>\n\n===Yuuzhan Vong War and beyond===\n{{Quote|Success usually requires precise timing. He knows what he's doing. And he's ''not'' my husband, Lieutenant Pallin.|Ors discusses timing with Lt. Pallin|Equals and Opposites}}\nEventually, Admiral Drayson retired, and Ors took over Alpha Blue just before the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. In the desperate circumstances the invasion engendered, Ors looked back to her terrorist roots and, with the help of the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]], [[Lurrian]] genetic engineers, and others, concocted the genocidal bioagent [[Alpha Red (pathogen)|Alpha Red]].<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /> Fortunately, the invasion was halted before Alpha Red had to be put to widespread use.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Jan_Ors_tales.jpg|thumb|left|Ors on Ord Sedra.]]\nIn addition to her work with intelligence, Ors still performed some field missions during the war. On one such occasion on [[Ord Sedra]], Ors and Katarn teamed up with a local Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] unit under the command of [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Pallin]]. A force of [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Warrior caste|warriors]] and [[Peace Brigade|Peace Brigadiers]] had captured an entire village and taken them as slaves. While being transported, Katarn infiltrated them, while Ors and Pallin orchestrated an ambush of the patrol. The ambush was successful and resulted in the freeing of the slaves and the capture of the enemy forces which were left under the guard of the Imperial troops. They proved unable to contain them, however, and in her rush to aid them, Ors was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong. Only the timely arrival of Katarn saved her life. After that, Katarn asked her to marry him, but she refused.<ref name=\"Equals and Opposites\" />\n\nFollowing the end of the invasion, Katarn disappeared while investigating rumors of [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] activity. Ors, along with Katarn's former apprentice [[Jaden Korr]], used every free moment to track him down. Eventually, she teamed up with [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] in forming an elite team of Alpha Blue agents and [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] to find him. The trail led to [[the Cloak of the Sith]], where the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Daye Azur-Jamin]] held Katarn captive. Katarn was freed and Azur-Jamin, redeemed from the dark side of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], revealed the existence of a [[Vongerella|Force-strong female Yuuzhan Vong]].<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nOne of the first traits of her personality displayed, was her tendency to do things by herself, without asking others for help, something that her mother noticed when Jan was already four. Growing up within the two separate arts of her parents, engineering and dance, she practiced both; for her both principles expressed the same impulse or need for her: to generate motion. The process of working on (mostly mobile, almost never stationary) machines was for her a kinesthetic experience.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\"/>\n\nJan Ors was a brave woman. Even from a young age she would not let the Empire intimidate her into submission.<ref name=\"The Dark Forces Saga 2\" /> As an Intelligence officer she was thorough, and had a plan every step of the way for her double agent operations.<ref name=\"Cracken's Rebel Operatives\" /> Indeed, when Katarn saw her eyes, obviously connected through the Force, was calmness and determination, having experienced fear, responsibilities and also disasters. In the same time, her pure artistic talent as inherited by her mother, was an essential part of her nature.<ref name=\"Soldier for the Empire\"/>\n\nWhen she worked with Katarn, Ors' detailed oriented nature and ability to gather intelligence greatly aided Katarn on his missions, although they came into conflict on occasion due to Katarn's more chaotic, straightforward approach. Despite their differences, they maintained a friendly and playful relationship, and Ors was quick to crack a joke or sarcastic remark at Katarn's expense.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II\" />\n\nShe was extremely dedicated to both the Rebellion and the New Republic being one of their first members and continuing to serve for over thirty years.<ref name=\"math\">She was already highly decorated by the time of Yavin ([[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]) and continued to serve past the Yuuzhan Vong war ([[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]])</ref> She was also very loyal to her friends willing to face extreme danger in order to help Katarn on his personal mission.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n===Portrayal===\n[[File:Jan_Ors_DFII_concept_art.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Concept art of Jan Ors from Dark Forces II Jedi Knight.]]\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces]]'', Jan Ors is voiced by [[Julie Eccles]], who also plays [[Ru Murleen]] in [[Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire|''Star Wars: Rebel Assault II'']]. She appears only in stills. In ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'', she is played by model [[Angela Harry]], whose likeness has been used in subsequent portrayals of Ors. In ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast]]'', she is voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]. In the ''Dark Forces'' audio dramatizations she is portrayed by actress and comedian [[Mo Collins]], best known for her work on [[Wikipedia:MADtv|MADtv]].\n\n===Continuity===\nJan Ors was created as a supporting character for the game ''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces]]'', and reappeared in its sequels, excluding ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'' (beyond a brief mention). ''Jedi Knight'' comes with an alternate ending where Kyle Katarn fell to the dark side and, when prompted by Jerec, killed Ors. The [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] ending has been deemed by [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] to be the [[canon]]ical ending, and is reflected in later products.\n\n''[[The Dark Forces Saga]], Part 2: [http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050407b Unsung Heroes of the Light]'' retconned her into the same character as ''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]'' mysterious Jan Strange, who was created four years before ''Dark Forces''.\n\n===Character===\nJan Ors is also a playable character in the multi-player modes of all of the games in the ''Jedi Knight'' series. It is interesting to note that the unused female Jedi model in ''Jedi Outcast'' is just a jacketless Ors with a lightsaber and [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]]. Though it does not appear in the main game, it is accessible using the cheat \"npc spawn jedif\". In addition, Jan, like almost every non-Force user in the Jedi Knight series, can utilize the lightsaber as a primary melee weapon if she is called to a multiplayer game as CPU-controlled bot.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Jan_ors.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Jan Ors in a shoot-out with Imperial stormtroopers during a [[Mission to Kejim|mission]] to [[Kejim]].]]\n*''[[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire]]'' / [[Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama|audio]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent]]'' / [[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent audio drama|audio]]\n*''[[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight]]'' / [[Dark Forces: Jedi Knight audio drama|audio]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]''\n*''[[N.R.I.
