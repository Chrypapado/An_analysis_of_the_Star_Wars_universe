Tolas was a successful merchant who was not afraid to utilize shady practices to make money, though all his dealings were legal, as he said. He was the owner of [[1B-8D-GE3|1B-8D]], described by [[Panar]] as \"the perfect fence for [[Droid/Legends|droid]] parts\". When he was met by [[Meetra Surik]] during her visit to [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], Tolas offered to purchase a [[starport visa]] from her in order to get offworld and Surik may have given him one.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThough Tolas claims that his buying price for an open starport visa is the best to be had at two thousand [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], there is actually another, better offer to be had in the [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|Iziz cantina]].\n\nTolas has the same face model as [[Davik Kang]], the [[Exchange]] boss on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], from [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|''Knights of the Old Republic'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tolas\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
