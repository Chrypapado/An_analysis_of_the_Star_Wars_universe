Lakuviv was an ambitious [[ranking distant]] of the [[Xodlak family]] who sought to advance his career and attain the rank of [[Cousin]], and to return the [[Great Families|Great]] Xodlak family to the spot it had once held among the [[Nine Ruling Families|Ten Ruling Families]] of the Ascendancy. In his ambitions, Lakuviv inadvertently played into a [[Plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy|scheme]] by the [[Grysk]] [[Jixtus]] and [[Haplif]] of the [[Agbui]] to draw the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] into a civil war.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy]], Lakuviv served as the Xodlak family Councilor for [[Redhill province]] of Celwis, headquartered at the city of [[Redhill]]. While serving there, he was approached by a Chiss mid-ager named [[Coduyo'po'nekri]] accompanied by three [[Agbui]] named [[Haplif]], [[Shimkif]] and [[Frosif]]. The Agbui claimed to be \"cultural nomads\" hoping to learn about the culture of the Chiss. In fact, they hoped to draw the Ascendancy into a civil war. The Agbui gave Lakuviv a valuable [[nyix brooch]], which led him to plot to acquire more of the rare metal for the Ascendancy and his Xodlak family. Lakuviv believed the [[nyix]] used in the Agbui's jewelry would lead to the Xodlak's return to the [[Nine Ruling Families]], and his own promotion from [[Ranking distant]] to [[Cousin]] or even [[Blood (rank)|Blood]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nLakuviv dispatched his [[Senior Aide]] [[Xodlak'ji'iprip]] \"Lakjip\" to visit a [[Unidentified settlement (Agbui)|mining settlement]] on a supposedly [[nyix]]-rich [[Hoxim|Agbui mining world]] that Haplif told them about. Upon Lakjip's return and confirmation of what she saw, Lakuviv and Lakjip plotted to claim the planet for the Xodlak family. The pair believed that acquiring the mining world for the Xodlak would enhance the Xodlak family's status enough to allow it to rejoin the Nine Ruling Families and advance their careers.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nLakuviv declared a Xodlak [[family emergency]] posing as [[Patriel]] [[Xodlak'oo'nifis]], summoning all available Xodlak family members from the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet]] to [[Celwis]], in an attempt to seize control of the Agbui mining world. However, the [[Task Force Xodlak]] was met with a [[Pommrio fleet|fleet]] from the fellow Great Family the [[Pommrio family]] and another [[Expeditionary Force Alpha|fleet]] from the Great [[Erighal family]]. The families were each allied with a [[Nine Ruling Families|Ruling Family]] that rivaled the other two Great Families' allied Ruling Family.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nHostilities [[Skirmish above Hoxim|nearly broke out]] between the forces of the Great Families above the Agbui mining world, until [[Senior Captain]]s [[Irizi'in'daro]] and [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]] were able to convince the Great Families' fleets to work together against a supposed threat, which was in reality a force of remote-controlled fighter craft controlled by Xodlak, Pommrio, and Erighal family members aboard Thrawn's ''[[Springhawk]]'' [[Chiss heavy cruiser|heavy cruiser]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\nFollowing the skirmish above Hoxim, Lakuviv and Lakjiip were [[prison|imprisoned]] for their coup against Patriel Lakooni and stripped of their titles and ranks.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nLakuviv was highly ambitious and sought to increase his standing both within the Xodlak family and the Ascendancy on the whole. He was willing to threaten [[Patriel]] [[Xodlak'oo'nifis]] at [[charric]]-point to try to seize control of a [[Hoxim|planet]] rich in the rare and valuable metal [[nyix]].<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Celwis residents]]\n[[Category:Chiss]]\n[[Category:Councilors of the Chiss Ascendancy]]\n[[Category:Impersonators]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ranking distants]]\n[[Category:Xodlak family]]"}}}]}}}}
