Apparently he was enslaved in a spice mine on Kessel until Chewbacca freed him. While they are not of the same family, they consider each other ''brothers'', and Sagwa feels that he owes Chewbacca a great debt.|C-3PO|Star Wars (2020) 13}}\n'''Sagwa''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[Wookiee]] who was [[Prison|imprisoned]] by the [[Galactic Empire]] in the [[Spice mines of Kessel|spice mines of]] [[Kessel]]. After [[Standard year|years]] of toil, Sagwa was freed by [[Chewbacca]] and participated in a [[Raid on Kessel|break-out]], escaping alongside [[Tak]] and other [[Slavery|slaves]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Stay with me, Sagwa! Keep up!|Tak|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}\nSagwa was a Wookiee from the inland [[tree]] [[city]] of [[Rwookrrorro]] on the [[planet]] [[Kashyyyk]]. During the [[Imperial Era]] he attempted to defend his fellow Wookiees from Imperial patrols, but was imprisoned and forced to work in the spice mines of Kessel as a slave. He wore an electro-charged [[Shock collar|slaving collar]] and had his shaggy arms bound by heavy shackles. Years of toil took their toll on his body, leaving his [[Color|brown]] fur balding due to illness, though he continued to selflessly spare weaker slaves from the most brutal mining duties.<ref name=\"Official Guide\" />\n\nSagwa was among the slaves who participated in the [[Raid on Kessel|uprising]] instigated by [[L3-37]], and was freed by Chewbacca after the Wookiee attacked Sagwa's guards. The two Wookiees fought alongside each other, and Sagwa helped Chewbacca and [[Han Solo]] escape the mines with a stash of unrefined [[coaxium]]. Once outside, Sagwa fought off [[Pyke sentinel]]s and helped Chewbacca load the coaxium into smuggling compartments aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. He bid farewell to Chewbacca before following [[Tak]] and other escaped prisoners.<ref name=\"Solo\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSagwa was a selfless individual, attempting to defend his fellow Wookiees from Imperial patrols on Kashyyyk, and later sparing weaker slaves from brutal toil in the spice mines of Kessel.<ref name=\"Official Guide\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition (audiobook)|''Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition'' audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars (2020) 13|''Star Wars'' (2020) 13]]\n*[[Bounty Hunters 13|''Bounty Hunters'' 13]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Galactic Explorer's Guide]]''\n*[[Star Wars Day-at-a-Time Calendar 2021|''Star Wars'' Day-at-a-Time Calendar 2021]] {{Po}}\n*{{Databank|sagwa|Sagwa|archivedate=20181208104151}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Sagwa\n|fr=Sagwa\n|ja=\u30b5\u30b0\u30ef\n|ka=\u10e1\u10d0\u10d2\u10d5\u10d0\n|pl=Sagwa\n|ru=\u0421\u0430\u0433\u0432\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pyke Syndicate slaves]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
