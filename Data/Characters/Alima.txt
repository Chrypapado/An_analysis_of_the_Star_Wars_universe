Only a fool would want to be captain of Lord Vader's flagship: The mortality rate is phenomenal.|Alima to [[Momaw Nadon/Legends|Momaw Nadon]]|The Sand Tender: The Hammerhead's Tale}}\n'''Alima''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who served in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nAlima was born on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. He rose through the ranks of the Navy to reach [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Conquest (Imperial I-class)/Legends|''Conquest'']].\n\nHe was given the task of [[Subjugation of Ithor|subjugating]] [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]] and leveled much of Ithor's [[Cathor Hills]]. For his actions he was given the opportunity of becoming captain of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]]. Realizing the threat this posed to his life, Alima purposefully got himself demoted to prevent himself from becoming captain.\n\nAfterwards he was placed in charge of locating [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and discovered [[Momaw Nadon/Legends|Momaw Nadon]], his old [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] nemesis, in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], and demanded that the Ithorian find the droids, or the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] would wipe out his gardens.\n\nAfter the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] escaped from Tatooine, Nadon told the [[Imperial Prefect]] that Alima had ignored Nadon's information regarding the ''Millennium Falcon''. Alima was executed by the Prefect instantly. Nadon, regretting his actions, stole genetic samples of Alima's DNA and cloned the former captain. In keeping with the [[Law of Life]], Nadon made two clones of Alima, in punishment for Alima's actions, and as a reminder of Nadon's.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Play It Again, Figrin D'an: The Tale of Muftak and Kabe]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The Sand Tender: The Hammerhead's Tale]]''\n*''[[Trade Wins: The Ranat's Tale]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Galaxy of Fear: Spore]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Movie Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope'', Second Edition]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{FFCite|33|CAN8-10, ''Mos Eisley Cantina Characters''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 36]]''\n*{{DB|character|momawnadon|Nadon, Momaw|archivedate=20110911033610}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Alima\n|de=Alima\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy captains of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Stormtrooper officers of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
