The son of [[Duke/Legends|Duchess]] [[Lassa Nibs]], he stole a large [[Diamond/Legends|diamond]] known as the [[Eye of Corell]] from her which traced their family line back for many generations. He stole the diamond due to a wish for excitement and adventure, and planned to use it to fund the beginnings of a criminal career. He then fled, being chase by the local [[Drall police|police]], and found a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] in a market near the [[Boiling Sea]]. He offered to pay the group {{Cr}}500 to help him evade capture, but was willing to pay them up to the full 2000 [[Credit chip/Legends|credit sticks]] he carried on him in his [[Utility belt/Legends|utility belt]]. A self-centered and naive individual, Nibs was good at lying and generally deceitful behaviour, telling those he begged for help that he had been falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit. At the time he begged for help he looked particularly disheveled, with matted and dirty fur.<ref name=\"SoF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBoffen Nibs first appeared as a character in the adventure module \"[[Beyond the Boiling Sea]]\", one of several modules included in the ''[[Suns of Fortune]]'' sourcebook for the [[Fantasy Flight Games]] ''[[Star Wars: Edge of the Empire]]'' roleplaying system. The book, which was released in [[2014]], gave several ways in which the players, whom were the spacers Nibs begged for help, could react but favored no one option and so this article makes no assumption about what action was taken.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{FFG|book=Suns of Fortune|text=''Suns of Fortune''|story=Beyond the Boiling Sea|stext=''Beyond the Boiling Sea''}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nibs, Boffen}}\n[[Category:Drall]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
