I need help to find him.|[[Madison Silene]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Kyran Silene lived in [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]]. He was the husband of [[Madison Silene]] and he was friend with [[Bandor Mokk]].<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Talk to Bandor|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nAt some point, Kyran Silene was captured by the [[Corellian slavers]] and [[Slavery/Legends|enslaved]] in the [[Corellian Slaver Bunker]] near Tyrena.<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Kyran led a group of slaves who managed to escape the bunker. However, the escaped slaves did not reach Tyrena and established a camp in the wilderness.<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\" /> In the meantime, Madison contacted a spacer who had previously helped her friend [[Angela]] to find her missing husband.<ref name=\"SWG:SR\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Situation Resolved|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer interrogated Bandor Mokk and the man finally revealed that Kyran Silene was captured by slavers but managed to escape.<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\" /> The spacer then traveled to the camp of the escaped slave. There, Kyran Silene explained that he could not come back until the situation was resolved. The spacer therefore infiltrated the Corellian Slaver Bunker and sliced the bunker's main computer. Using the bunker's own communications array, the spacer broadcasted the slavers' records on the [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] emergency request channels.<ref name=\"SWG:IE\" /> Dozens of CorSec agents quickly moved to the slaver bunker and freed all the slaves. Kyran Silene eventually returned to a normal life with Madison.<ref name=\"SWG:HbtKS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Head back to Kyran Silene|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKyran Silene was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:IE\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Kyran Silene was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Incriminating Evidence}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Silene, Kyran}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Zabrak]]"}}}]}}}}
