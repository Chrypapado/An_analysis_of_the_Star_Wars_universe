It contained the [[sun crystal]]s which, on occasion, had been taken from the cavern. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Warrick]] mistakenly broke the sun [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]] that had been a symbol for the Ewoks for around a hundred [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. Desparate to prove [[Gender/Legends|his]] courage, Warrick traveled to the Black Cavern in search of a new crystal. Unbeknownst to him, he had been followed by the [[Dulok/Legends|Dulok]] [[Boogutt]], who also wished to obtain a crystal.\n\nWhile inside the cave, Warrick discovered a sun crystal, but Boogutt took it before he could do so. It was then that the [[guardian of the sun crystal]] arrived to try and prevent the two individuals from leaving. After a lengthy chase through the cave, Warrick and Boogutt were able to escape, finding that several Ewoks and Duloks and arrived at the cavern entrance, hoping to save their respective young. However, the guardian pulled Boogutt back in, leading Warrick to save him but destroying the newfound sun crystal in the process.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early usage and Wicket's failure===\n{{Quote|I..I seek the sun crystal!''\"<br />\"''A sun crystal, eh?

The crystal acted as a symbol of Ewok courage for the next hundred [[Standard year/Legends|years]].<ref name=\"E13\" />\n\nHowever, in 3 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY]],<ref name=\"E13\" /> the [[Youngling/Legends|young]] Ewok scout [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Warrick]] accidentally destroyed the sun crystal, leading him to be reprimanded by [[Head Elder]] [[Kazak]], who was angry at him for destroying the [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]]-old Ewok symbol. After Warrick overheard the elder note to [[Chief/Legends|Chief]] [[Chirpa/Legends|Chirpa]] that [[Gender/Legends|he]] felt the Ewoks' mission to the Black Cavern had been a true test of courage, he decided to redeem himself by procuring a new crystal from the cavern. Once Warrick's friend, [[Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka]], discovered that the breakage of the sun crystal was not actually Warrick's fault, she rushed to tell him only to discover that he was already gone. She and another friend, [[Teebo/Legends|Teebo]], ran to Chirpa to let him know. He suggested that the [[Shaman/Legends|medicine man]] [[Logray/Legends|Logray]] be consulted, though the shaman's [[Crystal image spinner|viewing crystal]] had already revealed to him the news that not only had Warrick gone after the Black Cavern, but so had the [[Dulok/Legends|Dulok]] [[Prince/Legends|prince]] [[Boogutt]].<ref name=\"E13\" />\n\n===Wicket dares to enter===\n{{Quote|<nowiki />''Who'' wishes to enter the ''Black Cavern?''<nowiki />''\"<br />\"''<nowiki />''[Gulp!]'' W-Wicket the Ewok, s-sir!|The Black Cavern and Wicket|Ewoks 13}}\n[[File:BlackCavern1.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Wicket approaches the cavern.]]\nOnce Warrick arrived at the location of the cavern, he found only a blank wall in the side of the rock. It was then that the Black Cavern revealed itself, asking who intended on entering. Warrick nervously gave his name, explaining that he was looking for a sun crystal. The cavern was intrigued at the scout's wish, noting that while many had tried, few had succeeded, and that were the Ewok to indeed find a sun crystal, he would need to leave the cavern prior to the entrance closing. If he ran out of time, he would be trapped forever. Despite the potential repercussions, Warrick felt that he had no choice and entered the cave, with Boogutt following suit, hoping to score an easy sun crystal. Once inside, Warrick had trouble finding his way around due to the darkness, but he eventually came to a glowing spot, which he quickly deduced was the crystal.<ref name=\"E13\" />\n\nIn his excitement, Boogutt ran toward Warrick's find, revealing his presence and allowing Warrick to catch him. The Ewok was surprised by the Dulok's appearance, who revealed that it was he who had caused Warrick to break the original crystal in the first place. Before Warrick could even get angry at the prince, Boogutt grabbed the newfound crystal and attempted to escape with it, but it was then that its [[Guardian of the sun crystal|guardian]] came out from beneath the ground, asking who had dared to try and steal it. Boogutt tried to pin the blame on Warrick, tossing him the cystal and running toward the entrance, but the guardian announced that no one was permitted to leave, and the Dulok screamed in fright as he was chased. Warrick, with the crystal in [[Limb/Legends|hand]], discovered a new tunnel that the two could use to escape, so he led Boogutt down it in the hope that it led to the entrance.<ref name=\"E13\" />\n\n===Escaping&hellip; twice===\n{{Quote|<nowiki />''Wicket!'' No! the entrance is ''closing!''<nowiki />''\"<br />\"''Well, I'll just have to put a ''stop'' to that!|Kneesaa and Wicket|Ewoks 13}}\n[[File:BlackCavern2.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Boogutt is drawn back into the Black Cavern.]]\nThey ran down the tunnel's path, eventually coming to a crevice in the cavern's ground. Several [[Vine/Legends|vines]] hung from the ceiling, allowing for the pair to swing across. Boogutt was scared and refused to do so, but the guardian came close, and Warrick was forced to grab him and save him himself. As the monster was still gaining on them, the Ewok motioned for Boogutt to run, as the entrance was near and still open. At the same time, a party of Ewoks and Duloks who had banded together to try and save their respective young from the cavern arrived, finding the two being spit out by the Black Cavern's [[Mouth/Legends|mouth]]. They began to celebrate their return, but their happiness was short lived when the guardian reached through the cavern's mouth and grabbed Boogutt, taking him back in.<ref name=\"E13\" />\n\nThe entrance also began to close, putting Boogutt's live in danger. Warrick was committed to helping him, using the new sun crystal to jam the entrance open and get inside the cave. He found Boogutt hanging onto a rock as the guardian tried to pull him in. The Ewok grabbed Boogutt's [[Knife/Legends|knife]] and stabbed the [[Species/Legends|creature]], forcing him to release the young Dulok. The two then jumped out of the cave at the last chance, just as the cavern's mouth closed and crushed the sun crystal to pieces. The Duloks then left, with Boogutt's [[Parent/Legends|father]], [[King/Legends|King]] [[Gorneesh]], angry at his son for letting the Ewoks save him. Kazak was present as well, and he commended Warrick for his courage in that day's events. All of the Ewoks then left the cavern to go home.<ref name=\"E13\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|The choice is yours! ''Enter!''<nowiki />|The Black Cavern|Ewoks 13}}\nThe Black Cavern was willing to trap young Ewoks and Duloks inside the cave for eternity. The Black Cavern  gave Warrick a choice of whether or not to come in the cave, but at the same time shouted \"Enter!\" as though to persuade him. The cavern was [[Color/Legends|yellow]] on the outside and appeared blank unless it revealed itself, and inside, there were many tunnels and pathways.
