This led him to struggle against Drik Bandrik.<ref name=\"SWG:RB\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Drik Bandrik tasked his employee [[Rakir Banai]] to deal with the troublemaker, deliberately concealing that Kitster was in fact Rakir's long missing son. After the man discovered the truth, Rakir decided to leave Bandrik's service despite he was still under contract. The man tasked a spacer to meet the majordomo Wizzel to retrieve his contract by force as Bandrik would not be eager to leave Rakir leave peacefully. The spacer tracked down Wizzel and fought him as well as some [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]]. The spacer managed to kill them all, and obtain the contract. This allowed Rakir Banai to leave Bandrik and go in search for his son Kitster.<ref name=\"SWG:RB\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:ToughThugMaleRodianTemplate.jpg|250px|thumb|Randomly generated depictions of Wizzel]]\nWizzel was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]].<ref name=\"SWG:RB\" /> The game was shut down on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Rakir Banai}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wizzel}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Majordomos]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
