We're lost in a game of chance to a new master who turns out to be a smuggler.

Hortine briefly owned the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] after winning them in a game of [[Liar's Cut/Legends|Liar's Cut]]. When he was arrested by [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|law enforcement]] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] of [[Ingo/Legends|Ingo]], Hortine ejected his cargo to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] below, including the droids, who had been in the cargo bay at the [[Time/Legends|time]].\n\nAfter finding the orphaned [[Youngling/Legends|child]] [[Kaj Nedmak]] stowed away aboard his [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]], Hortine allowed him to remain aboard and trained him to become a smuggler. When Hortine retired several years later, he left his [[Starship/Legends|ship]] to Nedmak.\n\n==Biography==\nThe [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Zevel Hortine was already operating as a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]]<ref name=\"CB\" /> in the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before the [[Declaration of a New Order|rise]] the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Around that [[Time/Legends|time]],<ref name=\"KajDate\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'' places the events of \"[[Crimson Bounty]]\" in [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]]. [[Kaj Nedmak]]'s profile in \"Crimson Bounty\" states that he had been working with [[Celia Durasha]] for at least a [[Standard year/Legends|year]] by the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the story, having previously worked alone for thirteen years since Hortine retired. Nedmak was seventeen years old when Hortine retired and had been with the older [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] since he was nine. Therefore, that the two had begun working together by around [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], placing their first meeting in the years before the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] was [[Declaration of a New Order|formed]], which occurred in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]] according to ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''.</ref> [[Kaj Nedmak]], a nine-year-old orphan from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Drall (planet)|Drall]] in the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]], stowed away aboard Hortine's [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]]. Taking a liking to the [[Youngling/Legends|child]], Hortine allowed him to remain aboard. Over the following years, Hortine instructed Nedmak in the ways of smuggling and [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]].<ref name=\"CB\" />\n\n[[File:Ingo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A trail of Hortine's jettisoned cargo falls toward Ingo.]]\nBy [[15 BBY/Legends|15 BBY]],<ref name=\"15BBY\">{{PolyhedronCite|170|Star Wars Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO}} states that [[Star Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO|''Star Wars: Droids'']] is set fifteen [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], which corresponds to [[15 BBY/Legends|15 BBY]] according to ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''.</ref> Hortine had earned some notoriety<ref name=\"P170\">{{PolyhedronCite|170|Star Wars Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO}}</ref> as a cutthroat [[Glitterstim/Legends|glitterstim]] smuggler.<ref name=\"NEGC\">''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''</ref> Hortine won the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] in a game of [[Liar's Cut/Legends|Liar's Cut]] from the owner of a [[Sindee's refueling station|refueling station]], the [[Bimm (Near-Human)|Bimm]] businesswoman [[Sindee]].<ref name=\"TDRA\">{{SW|url=news/the-droids-re-animated-part-1|text=The Droids Re-Animated, Part 1|int=The Droids Re-Animated}}</ref> A few [[Standard day/Legends|days]] after acquiring the droids, Hortine's [[Starship/Legends|ship]] was intercepted by [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|law enforcement]] vessels<ref name=\"TotGD\">''[[C-3PO: Tales of the Golden Droid]]''</ref> in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] of [[Ingo/Legends|Ingo]], a planet in the [[Bortele Cluster]] of the [[Mid Rim]].<ref name=\"P170\" /> Hoping to avoid prosecution, Hortine jettisoned his cargo of contraband<ref name=\"TDRA\" /> and stolen goods<ref name=\"TWW\">{{DroidsCite|The White Witch|The ''White Witch''}}</ref> and attempted to flee,<ref name=\"TotGD\" /> only to be arrested by the authorities.

Thirteen years later, Nedmak found a young woman named [[Celia Durasha]] stowed away in the cargo hold of his [[YT-2400 light freighter/Legends|YT-2400 light freighter]] ''[[Tryan Kajme]]''.

Such was his opinion of Nedmak, that Hortine left his ship to the younger smuggler when he retired.<ref name=\"CB\" />\n\nWhen Hortine's profession brought him into conflict with the authorities, he was willing to dump his cargo rather than face charges.
