However, after the Ugors briefly left the droid unguarded, a crew of rival Squib salvagers claimed the droid for themselves. The Ugors and Squibs subsequently became involved in an argument regarding the rightful ownership of the droid; the Ugors deemed the protocol droid a holy artifact and alleged that they were entitled to him under [[Ugorian Divine Law]], while the Squibs contended that 7-A39 was rightfully theirs under [[High Squibbian Law]], because the Ugors had left the droid undefended. The Ugor [[SplrMuck]] and the Squib [[Jiminaldo-mabbramsti]] also engaged in a tug-of-war, pulling on the droid from either side in attempt to take it for themselves, much to 7-A39's dismay. A group of [[Alderaanian Resistance]] agents, who had traveled to Almas to [[Mission to Almas|search]] for a [[Qornah Holocron|Jedi holocron]], passed by the scene of the quarrel, and the Ugors called upon the agents to resolve the dispute.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" />\n\n{{RPG|\"[[Echoes of the Jedi]]\"}}\nThe resistance agents negotiated with SplrMuck and the Squibs to purchase the droid, and the Ugors agreed to relinquish their claim to the droid in return for {{Cr}}2,000, while the Squibs were content to swap the droid for the agents' [[Breath mask/Legends|breath masks]]. Carried by the agents in a [[net]], 7-A39 acted as a guide for the Alderaanian Resistance team while they explored the academy ruins. Shortly afterward, the agents discovered a fragment of a [[Sith (language)|Sith]] [[Book/Legends|tome]] in the facility's archive room, and 7-A39 translated the text for them. However, the droid's recital of the document triggered a [[Groundquake/Legends|groundquake]] that caused the room to shudder. The agents also visited the academy's control room, and there, 7-A39 accessed a [[Computer/Legends|computer]] and obtained a map of the academy's sub-levels for his new masters.<ref name=\"Echoes of the Jedi\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Quote|This appears to be a dead language.
