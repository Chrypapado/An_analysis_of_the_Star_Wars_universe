Circa [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]], Risstenni's son, [[Chywarra]], was abducted by the [[Wyrd]], a group of [[Tarasin]] [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Witch/Legends|witches]]. They took him to the extinct [[Volcano/Legends|volcano]] [[Cloud Mountain]], where they placed him inside the [[Hand artifact]], a [[Force artifact/Legends|Force-imbued statue]] that allowed its controller to draw power from the artifact's occupant. Risstenni traveled to Cloud [[Mountain/Legends|Mountain]] in search of her son and was captured by the Wyrd, who offered to let her take Chywarra's place inside the artifact. She accepted, entered the statue, and was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during a Wyrd ritual. She was transformed into a [[Force ghost|dark side spirit]] and, in her new form, encountered a [[Heroes of Cularin|group]] of agents that had come to Cloud Mountain to search for her and Chywarra.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I woke up early this morning and there was no sign of my son. It's not like him to go off by himself, so I started searching for him.|Risstenni|From the Trees}}\n[[File:Starwars_livingforce_swlfcularin_picMain_en.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cularin, the planet on which Risstenni lived]]\nRisstenni was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who lived during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. At some point, she mated with [[Risstenni's mate|another Wookiee]] and [[Reproduction/Legends|gave birth]] to a son, [[Chywarra]].<ref name=\"From the Trees\" /> Circa [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\" /> the family became residents of [[Kiirloor]], a Wookiee settlement that had been established on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] following the [[Death/Legends|death]] of the Wookiee [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kirlocca]]. However, the [[Wyrd]], a group of [[Tarasin]] [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Witch/Legends|witches]] that lived on Cularin, opposed the presence of the Wookiees at Kiirloor. One morning, two [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after the establishment of Kiirloor, the Wyrd kidnapped Chywarra and planned to draw power from him using a hand-shaped [[Force artifact/Legends|Force-imbued statue]] known as the [[Hand artifact]]. The Wyrd hoped this would allow them to cause the inactive [[Volcano/Legends|volcano]] [[Cloud Mountain]] to erupt and destroy Kiirloor.<ref name=\"From the Trees\" />\n\nAfter waking up to find Chywarra missing, Risstenni began looking for him. After a while she found a toy [[Ryyk blade/Legends|ryyk blade]] that belonged to her son, and she left it in a [[Tree/Legends|tree]] near Cloud [[Mountain/Legends|Mountain]] to act as a sign for anyone who tried to follow her and Chywarra. She continued searching and sighted Chywarra being carried up the side of Cloud Mountain by a member of the Wyrd, so she climbed up the volcano and began looking for her son in the tunnels inside the mountain. Eventually, she discovered a large cavern that served as the headquarters of a Wyrd enclave that was located inside the mountain, and she began observing the Tarasin inside the chamber. However, she overheard some Wyrd members talking about how Chywarra had survived a session inside the Hand artifact; angered, Risstenni rushed out to attack the Tarasin. The group's leader, [[Xinishia]], told her that they would kill Chywarra if she tried to fight them, and she then used the Force to [[Mind trick/Legends|compel]] Risstenni to sit down. Xinishia offered to let Risstenni take Chywarra's place inside the statue during the Wyrd's next ritual. Risstenni agreed, as she could not see any other way to save the life of her son.<ref name=\"From the Trees\" />\n\nThe Tarasin allowed Risstenni to say goodbye to Chywarra and then helped her into the artifact's thumb. The Wookiee scratched at the interior of the device, but she was unable to climb out because it was made of a highly polished smooth material. When the Tarasin began their ritual, Risstenni was overcome with a feeling that something inside her was trying to tear her body apart, which caused her to pass out. The device drained her life force and killed her, transforming her into a [[Force ghost|dark side spirit]]. When Risstenni came to, she discovered that she had changed form and could move through the side of the statue. She thought about going to get help, but she did not want to leave her son, so she decided to remain within the enclave. The Wyrd ignored her in her new form and allowed her to listen to them discussing their plan; thus she learned of the witches' plan to destroy Kiirloor.<ref name=\"From the Trees\" />\n\n{{RPG|''[[From the Trees]]''}}\nWhen the Wookiees of Kiirloor discovered that Risstenni and Chywarra were missing, they sent representatives to ask [[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]] [[Dariana]] of the Tarasin [[Hiironi irstat]] if she knew who was responsible for the pair's disappearance. Dariana sent the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents who operated in the [[Cularin system]], to investigate the matter, and they traveled to the tunnels inside Cloud Mountain. Risstenni approached them while in the guise of a ghostly [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]], then worked out how to manifest herself and appeared to them in the form of a Wookiee. She spoke to the agents and explained to them how she had died. She then begged them to rescue her son and warned the agents that it was dangerous for them to continue traveling through the tunnels. However, while she was talking to them, a Tarasin [[Unidentified Tarasin Force ghost|Force ghost]] attacked the agents, with the aim of preventing them from interfering in the Wyrd's plans. Risstenni responded by entering combat with the spirit and allowed the agents to confront Xinishia and the other members of the Wyrd.<ref name=\"From the Trees\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|She offered me the chance to take my son's place for the next ritual. I didn't see any other option to save my son; there were too many to fight and I was afraid of losing control of my body again. I hoped I could hold on long enough for help to arrive.|Risstenni, on Xinishia's offer to let her take Chywarra's place inside the Hand artifact|From the Trees}}\nRisstenni was furious when she overheard the Wyrd members inside Cloud Mountain discussing how Chywarra had survived a session inside the Hand artifact, which made her want to tear Xinishia's [[Limb/Legends|limbs]] out. The Wookiee didn't want to agree to Xinishia's proposal that she take Chywarra's place inside the statue, but she agreed to it because it seemed the only way to save Chywarra, and because there were too many Wyrd members for Risstenni to fight by herself. She was also afraid that the Wyrd would use their [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] to take control of her body again, as when Xinishia used the Force to make the Wookiee sit down. Risstenni hoped that she would be able to survive long enough for help to arrive. Following her death and transformation into a dark side spirit, Risstenni was not filled with rage like most other dark side spirits were, because she had died sacrificing herself to save her child.<ref name=\"From the Trees\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRisstenni was created by [[Ed Gibson]] and appeared in ''[[From the Trees]]'', a [[Wizards of the Coast]] [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|role-playing]] adventure that formed part of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign. In the scenario, the players role-play as the Heroes of Cularin. It is possible for them to decline Dariana's call to help the Wookiees of Kiirloor; such a decision causes the player characters to never meet the spirit of Risstenni. If they do accept the assignment when they first encounter Risstenni, it is possible for them to attack her before she manifests herself into the form of a Wookiee. They can then destroy the spirit by using the Force power [[Force Light]]. If the player characters do speak to Risstenni and decide not to proceed further into the tunnels of Cloud Mountain, she is understanding and considers it more important that they warn the Wookiees of Kiirloor about the Wyrd's plan than that they rescue Chywarra.<ref name=\"From the Trees\" />\n\nIf the player characters make their way to the Wyrd enclave's headquarters, they are confronted by Xinishia and the Wyrd, who try to make a deal with them whereby the Wyrd frees Chywarra and lets the players leave the enclave unharmed if, in return, the player characters promise to convince the Wookiees to relocate Kiirloor. If the player characters agree to the demand, as they leave the chamber, Risstenni defeats the Wyrd spirit that she had been fighting and thanks the player characters for saving her son. Risstenni remains close to Chywarra for the rest of the adventure, and it is then possible for the player characters to suggest that Chywarra enroll at the [[Almas Academy]], a [[Jedi academy]] located on the planet [[Almas]]. If he chooses to do so, Risstenni's spirit accompanies him to the academy.<ref name=\"From the Trees\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[From the Trees]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Force ghosts]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
