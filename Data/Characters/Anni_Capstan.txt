Recruited at the [[Time/Legends|time]] of Rogue [[Squadron/Legends|Squadron's]] participation in the action between the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] and the [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|forces]] of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[Evacuation of Dubrillion|over]] the world of [[Dubrillion/Legends|Dubrillion]], Capstan went on to [[Starfighter combat/Legends|fight]] alongside her [[Wingmate/Legends|wingmate]], the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]], and became good friends with her. Flying as [[Rogue Twelve]], Capstan helped [[Battle of Dantooine (Yuuzhan Vong War)|evacuate]] [[Refugee/Legends|refugees]] from the planet [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] and participated in getting a [[New Republic Garqi reconnaissance team|reconnaissance team]] onto and [[Battle of Garqi|off]] the planet [[Garqi/Legends|Garqi]]. At [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]] in 25 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY]], where the New Republic and the [[Imperial Remnant]] [[Battle of Ithor|fought]] to defend the [[Tree/Legends|jungle]] world from the invaders, Capstan fell victim to enemy [[Yorik-et|coralskippers]] in the early stages of the fighting. Her damaged [[X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing starfighter]] crashed into a Yuuzhan Vong [[Crate|landing craft]], [[Death/Legends|killing]] her.\n\n==Biography==\n===Joining Rogue Squadron===\n{{Quote|Nice shot, Twelve.''\"<br />\"''Following your lead, Sticks.''\"<br />\"''We showed them!''\"<br />\"''We did.|Jaina Solo and Anni Capstan, after damaging Rock-One|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|female]]<ref name=\"On\" /> from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]<ref name=\"Ruin\" /> [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] before [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]], Anni Capstan at some [[Time/Legends|time]] participated in a [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] event near the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dubrillion/Legends|Dubrillion]], in which [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] sought to achieve the longest time spent flying in the [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] group known as [[Lando's Folly]]. There, Capstan set a decent time. In the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] 25 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY]], the [[Yuuzhan Vong galaxy|extra-galactic]] [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Species/Legends|species]] [[Yuuzhan Vong War|invaded]] [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], and, during the initial fighting between the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] and the invaders, Dubrillion was targeted. Driven [[Battle of Dubrillion|off once]], Yuuzhan Vong forces returned to lurk near the planet, and, at that time, Capstan was present on Dubrillion. As [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|New Republic forces]] planned to evacuate the citizens of Dubrillion and abandon the world to the invaders, Capstan was recruited into the elite starfighter group [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. She was chosen due to her time running Lando's Folly and was designated [[Rogue Twelve]], filling the position that the Rogue [[Tik]] had held before his [[Third skirmish in the Outer Rim|death]]; [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]], a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who was quite skilled at flying, was given the position of [[Rogue Eleven/Legends|Rogue Eleven]] to fill in the gap created by [[Dinger|another death]].<ref name=\"On\" />\n\n[[File:Jainasolo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jaina Solo, Capstan's wingmate and friend]]\nAs the [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] [[Convoy/Legends|convoy]] began to depart Dubrillion [[Realspace/Legends|space]], the Yuuzhan Vong forces that had been lurking nearby moved to [[Evacuation of Dubrillion|engage]] the convoy and its escort. As a part of Rogue [[Squadron/Legends|Squadron]], and specifically in [[Three Flight]] alongside Solo, Capstan launched from a [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] bay on Dubrillion in her [[T-65A3 X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighter]] and proceeded to place herself between the oncoming Yuuzhan Vong forces and the convoy. While other squadrons [[Starfighter combat/Legends|took on]] the [[Yorik-et|coralskipper]] groups that began to make runs on the convoy, Capstan and the other Rogues, including her [[Wingmate/Legends|wingmate]], Solo, were given the task of taking out [[Rock-One]], the [[miid ro'ik]] [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ship]] that was leading the invaders' [[Space warfare|assault]]. Capstan covered Solo as she made strafing runs on the [[Starship/Legends|ship]], and her wingmate soon discovered that Rock-One's [[Yaret-Kor|plasma launchers]] were vulnerable to enemy attack and not [[Deflector shield/Legends|shielded]] by the [[Gravity/Legends|gravity]]-manipulating effects of [[dovin basal]]s just before the launchers fired. Because of this, Solo timed a set of [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton torpedos]] so they flew into the launcher and detonated. Capstan followed her wingmate's lead and also managed to get one of a pair of proton torpedoes into the [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]] launcher right after her wingmate's set, and the resulting explosions heavily damaged the weapon.<ref name=\"On\" />\n\nJust then, Rock-One used its dovin basals to block the [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] [[Hyperlane|route]] that led to the world of [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]], the convoy's destination. Though some of the ships managed to make the jump before this occurred, the majority of the convoy was forced to head to the world of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] instead. With the convoy out of the [[Dubrillion system|system]], Capstan and Rogue Squadron broke off their attack on Rock-One and traveled to Dantooine.<ref name=\"On\" />\n\n===Engagement at Dantooine===\n{{Quote|Two and Twelve, keep the last skips off us.|Rogue Leader Gavin Darklighter|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught}}\nHowever, Yuuzhan Vong forces soon pursued the refugees from Dubrillion to Dantooine and [[Battle of Dantooine (Yuuzhan Vong War)|assaulted]] them there. Masses of [[Chazrach]] [[Soldier/Legends|ground troops]] attacked the [[Dantooine refugee base|refugee base]] that was located on the planet's surface, and Capstan and the rest of Rogue Squadron were tasked with occupying the coralskippers that were accompanying the Yuuzhan Vong [[Ground warfare|ground forces]]. In the middle of the battle, where New Republic ground forces engaged the invaders' Chazrach [[Troop/Legends|troops]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] requested that two members of Rogue Squadron complete a run on the [[Thrall herder|largest enemy ground vehicle]]. [[Rogue Leader/Legends|Rogue Leader]] [[Gavin Darklighter]] and Solo complied, and, while Capstan and [[Kral Nevil|Rogue Two]] watched their flanks, the pair fired a quartet of proton torpedoes at the vehicle.<ref name=\"On\" />\n\nAs the torpedoes were heading toward the vehicle, [[R2-series astromech droid|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] changed the trajectory of the [[Missile/Legends|missiles]] fired by Capstan's wingmate and commander by giving them a new set of data. When the gravity anomaly that the vehicle had created to block the initial threat to its side attempted to move between the missiles and the vehicle's spine, Skywalker, who was in the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] [[Impervious (shuttle)|''Impervious'']] alongside R2-D2, held the gravity anomaly back with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and then pushed it forward so that the anomaly hit the ground [[Transport/Legends|transport]] instead. The vehicle, which was the controller of the Chazrach, was sucked into the gravity anomaly and destroyed, while the missiles impacted the ground and detonated, killing many of the enemy ground [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]]. Because the controlling vehicle was destroyed, the ground troops went mad and attacked anything around them.<ref name=\"On\" />\n\nWith the majority of the refugees loaded into [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]], the New Republic evacuated the base. Capstan and the surviving members of Rogue Squadron accompanied them into the [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] of Dantooine, but a Yuuzhan Vong [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]] similar to the one they encountered at Dubrillion was using its dovin basals to prevent any of the convoy from escaping. Nevertheless, the convoy was rescued after the [[Bothan Assault Cruiser]] ''[[Ralroost]]'' and the [[Victory I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory I''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Corusca Fire]]'' arrived in the [[Dantooine system/Legends|system]] and drove off the cruiser so the convoy could make a getaway. After the battle on Dantooine, Solo moved into the squadron [[Barracks/Legends|barracks]] and took up a room with Capstan.<ref name=\"On\" />\n\n===Escorting a reconnaissance mission===\n{{Quote|Twelve here. I have one contact coming up from Garqi. Looks like our people.|Capstan reports on the ''Best Chance''{{'s}} position|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin}}\nLater that year, Capstan flew with the Rogues again, this time at the Yuuzhan Vong&ndash;occupied world of [[Garqi/Legends|Garqi]]. There, they flew from the ''Ralroost'' and were tasked with taking the coralskippers that came to [[Battle of Garqi|engage]] them while the battered freighter ''[[Lost Hope]]'' tried to enter Garqi's [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]]; the ''Lost Hope'' contained a [[New Republic Garqi reconnaissance team|reconnaissance team]], including Solo's brother, [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knight [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], which was tasked with obtaining valuable information about the enemy. When two of the ten coralskippers that came to engage Capstan and Rogue Squadron targeted the ''Lost Hope'', she and her wingmate moved to engage them. Solo quickly blasted the first enemy craft apart, and, while she covered for Capstan, Rogue Twelve went at the last coralskipper from the side, firing at it with all of her [[Laser cannon/Legends|laser cannons]]. However, the dovin basals of the enemy craft absorbed all of the shots.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nDespite this, Capstan scored a hit with one of a pair of proton torpedoes after the coralskipper crossed in front of her, destroying the craft completely. The ''Lost Hope'' exploded just then, due to an unknown cause, as seen by Capstan and the others; unbeknownst to them, the explosion had been engineered by the New Republic forces, and the reconnaissance team had ejected from the doomed ''Lost Hope'' via the [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] [[Best Chance (shuttle)|''Best Chance'']] to land unnoticed on Garqi by both their friends and their enemies. After withdrawing from the area around Garqi, the pilots were informed that the team had actually made it to the surface safely. Later, Capstan and Rogue Squadron were tasked with escorting the reconnaissance team back off Garqi. As soon as the ''Ralroost'' completed its [[Precision hyperspace jump|microjump]] into the [[Garqi system|system]], Capstan and her wingmate launched from its bays. They soon detected the ''Best Chance'' rising to meet them, but it was then that the Yuuzhan Vong forces arrived, with the [[Miid ro'ik|cruiser]] ''[[Burning Pride]]'' leading the [[Battle group/Legends|battle group]].<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nRogues Twelve and Eleven came at a group of six coralskippers heading for the ''Best Chance'', and Capstan fired two torpedoes, one after another. The first detonated prematurely, as intended, and the resulting gas cloud forced the group of craft apart. The second missile met two of the coralskippers that had fled when confronted with the gas cloud and destroyed both of them. While Solo took out one of the remaining craft, Capstan managed to damage another with her [[Laser/Legends|lasers]]. Despite the arrival of New Republic reinforcements, which consisted of two [[Victory-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory''-class Star Destroyers]], the battle seemed to be going poorly until the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|space forces]] of the [[Imperial Remnant]], alongside a small contingent of [[Nssis-class Clawcraft|''Nssis''-class Clawcraft]] from the [[Empire of the Hand]], came to Garqi. While the clawcraft helped mop up the remaining coralskippers that were harassing the ''Best Chance'' and the New Republic [[Battleship/Legends|battleships]], [[Hammer Group|two new Star Destroyers]] helped turn the tide of the battle. A group of clawcraft escorted Capstan and Solo back to the ''Ralroost'' before the entire New Republic&ndash;allied group departed the [[Star system/Legends|system]], their mission of getting the ''Best Chance'' out a success.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n===Death over Ithor===\n{{Quote|Sithspawn! I'm hit!|Anni Capstan, before her death|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin}}\nDuring Capstan's time serving as Solo's wing and [[Bunk/Legends|bunkmate]], she talked about Solo in every message she sent home to her [[Anni Capstan's mother|mother]] on Corellia, though Capstan herself never mentioned her family much when talking to Solo. Because Solo was a Jedi, Capstan, a [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]], never played with her due to the intuitive [[Force power/Legends|powers]] most Jedi possessed. Still, Solo and Capstan became good friends. Sometime after the events at Garqi, Capstan and the rest of Rogue Squadron were sent to defend the planet [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]], alongside a significant force from the New Republic, the Imperial Remnant, and the Empire of the Hand. The reconnaissance team had discovered during the mission to Garqi that the pollen of the [[Bafforr tree]]s native to Ithor had devastating effects on the [[Vonduun Skerr Kyrric|living armor]] that the Yuuzhan Vong [[warrior caste]] used, making Ithor a valuable asset to the war effort.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n[[File:RogueSquadron-TEA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Capstan flew as part of Rogue Squadron until her death over Ithor.]]\nAt Ithor, Capstan and Solo were tasked with [[Scout/Legends|scouting]] out a shuttle adrift that had appeared in the [[Ottega system/Legends|system]]. The ship matched the one that had taken [[Caamasi]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Elegos A'Kla]] to a peace talk with Yuuzhan Vong [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Shedao Shai]], and the shuttle was in its landing position with [[Biot|organic growths]] all over it. After an Imperial Remnant shuttle used its [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beams]] to haul the other shuttle to the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Chimaera/Legends|''Chimaera'']], Capstan and Solo were also ordered to land on the [[Warship/Legends|warship]], and they were [[Lifeform scanner|scanned]] for any life forms that may have hitched a ride. Told that they were clean, Capstan ran off, and Solo, who remained in the pilots' ready room, believed that she had found a game of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] somewhere on the Imperial vessel. In the shuttle, Jedi Knight [[Corran Horn]] found the decorated [[Bone/Legends|bones]] of A'Kla and an organic [[villip]] that carried a message from Shai, announcing that the two sides would meet at a [[Battle of Ithor|battle over Ithor]].<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nWhen the invaders' forces did come to Ithor, Capstan launched from the ''Ralroost'' alongside Rogue Squadron and fell into position behind Solo. As the enemy advanced toward the New Republic and Imperial positions, Rogue Squadron was assigned to take out the enemy [[Landing craft/Legends|landing craft]], which were dubbed [[crate]]s, destined for the surface of the [[Tree/Legends|jungle]] planet. After Solo took out a coralskipper, Capstan warned her to go to starboard and then shot up an enemy craft that was pursuing her wingmate. The pair broke through the fighter screen guarding the [[Troop carrier/Legends|troop carriers]], and Solo proceeded to damage one of them with her lasers before ordering Capstan to finish it off. However, two coralskippers came behind Capstan's [[X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] before she could break off her run on the crate. The pair of attackers quickly took out a pair of her [[Engine/Legends|engines]], and Capstan's starfighter swung out of control to impact the troop [[Carrier/Legends|carrier]] she had been targeting, [[Death/Legends|killing]] her.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nAlthough the New Republic defeated the forces assembled against them, the Yuuzhan Vong managed to wipe out all of the biological life on Ithor with a [[Bioweapon/Legends|bioweapon]] before the end of the battle. Upon Capstan's death, and after the battle at Ithor, Darklighter dispatched a message to Capstan's family, and Solo sent a small message along with it. Capstan's [[Parent/Legends|mother]], grieving at the loss of her daughter, told Solo in a response message that she would be welcome to visit Capstan's mother if Solo ever went to Corellia. She also told the Jedi that she had some of Capstan's things that she wanted Solo to have. Capstan's death affected Solo greatly,<ref name=\"Ruin\" /> and the Jedi thought about her wingmate's death throughout the war with the Yuuzhan Vong.<ref name=\"BP\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref><ref name=\"Rebirth\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]</ref><ref name=\"Star\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref><ref name=\"Lines\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref><ref name=\"Way\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref><ref name=\"Ylesia\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Ylesia]]''</ref> In tribute to her deceased wingmate, Solo named her [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech]] \"[[R2-B3|Cappie]].\"<ref name=\"TCSWE\">{{CSWECite|I|107|Capstan, Anni}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nCapstan was a skilled starfighter pilot, so much so that she managed to get a berth in the elite Rogue Squadron.<ref name=\"On\" /> She was able to hold her own in battle, though the coralskippers of the enemy Yuuzhan Vong ultimately killed her. She was also a gambler and was good enough that Solo considered her able to strip the [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from the players on the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''Chimaera''. During Capstan's time as Solo's wingmate, the two became close friends, and Capstan mentioned the Jedi in every message she sent back to her mother.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAnni Capstan first appeared in ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught]]'', by [[Michael A.
