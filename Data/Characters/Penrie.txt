He served as a [[pilot]] in the [[Imperial Navy]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He went to the [[Imperial Academy|academy]] with his fellow officer [[Ciena Ree]], and served [[Death Squadron]] aboard the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]''. He was [[Death|killed]] when an [[asteroid]] hit his [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE Fighter]] during the chase of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' shortly after the [[Battle of Hoth]].\n\n==Biography==\nPenrie joined the [[Galactic Empire]] as a [[cadet]] at the [[Academy for Young Imperials|Imperial Academy]] on the [[planet]] [[Lothal]]. Eventually, he became a [[TIE pilot]], designated NA811, in the [[Imperial Navy]]. Years into the war, he was serving onboard [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'', the flagship of [[Death Squadron]]. Penrie and three fellow pilots flew [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter]]s in pursuit of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' following the [[Battle of Hoth]]. Flying into an [[asteroid field]], Penrie and the others were assisted with navigation by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Ciena Ree]]. When pilots [[JA189]] and [[CR978]] were killed, Ree noted that Penrie's breathing became shallow and quick. Eventually, their quarry maneuvered to land on an [[asteroid]]. When Ree requested [[Captain]] [[Firmus Piett]] allow her to recall the two surviving pilots, he approved it. However, Penrie's remaining wingmate [[OL701]] responded that they had pursued the ''Millennium Falcon'' into a [[canyon]]. Howeer, Penrie then crashed into an asteroid and was killed, soon followed by OL701.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nPenrie was known for his infectious laugh, with his fellow officer Ciena Ree recalling that whenever he laughed, everyone else around him could not help but join him. Ree also noted that this occurred often because Penrie was easily amused.<ref name=\"LS\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPenrie was introduced in ''[[Lost Stars]]'', a young adult novel written by [[Claudia Gray]] as part of ''[[Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' series. Penrie is not seen physically in ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'', but it is confirmed that he was one of the pilots who chased the Millennium Falcon on the Asteroid Field.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lost Stars]]'' {{1stID}}\n*[[Lost Stars (audiobook)|''Lost Stars'' audiobook]]\n*[[Lost Stars (webcomic)|''Lost Stars'' webcomic]] {{C|Starfighter only}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] {{1st}} {{C|Starfighter only}}\n*''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]'' {{C|Starfighter only}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' junior novelization]] {{C|Starfighter only}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (Screen Comix)|''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' Screen Comix]] {{C|Starfighter only}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back|text=''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back''}} {{Imo}}\n*{{BuildXWingCite|24|Starfighter Aces|CR-978 &ndash; Elite But Expendable}}\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Battle of Hoth and the Second Death Star}} {{Imo}}\n*{{Databank|han-solo|Han Solo|archivedate=20200514053950}} {{C|indirect appearance only}}\n*{{Databank|tie-fighter|TIE fighter|archivedate=20200220131540}} {{Imo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Penrie#kanon\n|fr=Penrie\n|ja=\u30da\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\n|pt=C\u00e2non:Penrie\n|ru=\u041f\u0435\u043d\u0440\u0438\n}}\n\n[[Category:Death Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy pilots of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Lothalites]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
