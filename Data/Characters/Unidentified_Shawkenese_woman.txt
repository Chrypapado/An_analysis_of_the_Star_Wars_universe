The Rebel representative, [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], was looking for an individual to attend the [[First Conference of Free Peoples]] on the [[Endor/Legends|forest moon of Endor]]. The conference would include individuals from several planets to help determine the nature of the new galactic government. During the meeting, the woman served drinks to Skywalker, Santor, and Skywalker's friend, [[Kiro]].
