Geissler managed a [[Ryll Warehouse|warehouse]] in Kor Vella that was used to stock the [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] distributed in the city. The spice was provided by the [[Chirq Council]], best known as the Red Circle Gang, but Vuul Sarlin, Jaylon Geissler and their men ignored everything about the identity of the ryll smugglers.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the [[Corellian Security Force]] started an investigation against the ryll smuggling ring following the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. A [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] working for [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Lon Cope|Cope]] questioned a local spice addict known as [[Menchi Lerann]]. The man revealed that he bought his ryll from Vuul Sarlin and Jaylon Geissler. The spacer later interrogated Geissler but the spice dealer obviously refused to collaborate. The spacer therefore entered the ryll warehouse in Kor Vella, fought the guards and started to destroy crates of spice. Jaylon Geissler reluctantly accepted to give Vuul Sarlin's current location: a small camp in the plains outside Kor Vella. The spacer then defeated Vuul Sarlin and forced him to reveal everything he knew about the ryll smuggling ring.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council.<ref name=\"SWG:TCCTEC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|The Chirq Council: The Elite Council|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{PAGENAME}} appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CCFRSR\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|CorSec Case Files: Ryll Smuggling Ring}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geissler, Jaylon}}\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spice dealers]]"}}}]}}}}
