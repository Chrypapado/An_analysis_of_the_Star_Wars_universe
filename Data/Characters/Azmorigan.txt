On one occasion, the \"galactic entrepreneur\" [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] tricked him into selling a [[puffer pig]] in return for the [[Twi'lek]] [[captain]] [[Hera Syndulla]]. However, Hera escaped and rejoined Lando and her [[Spectres|rebel crew]] aboard the ''Ghost''. An enraged Azmorigan pursued Calrissian and his rebel associates to Lothal and attempted to exact revenge on Calrissian. However, the rebels fought off Azmorigan and his [[Azmorigan's henchmen|henchmen]]; forcing him to retreat.\n\nLater, Azmorigan purchased five power generators from the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]] and arranged to rendezvous with him on [[Nixus Hub 218]]. However, the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]] took over Vizago's ship ''[[Broken Horn]]''. Together with the rebels [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[C1-10P|Chopper]], Hondo traveled to Nixus only to be captured by Azmorigan and his henchmen. Seeking to settle scores with both Hondo and Ezra, Azmorigan decided to use a loading dolly to fire them into [[Realspace|space]]. However, his plans were foiled by Chopper who attacked his henchmen, creating a commotion that allowed Ezra and Hondo to free themselves and turn the table on him. Azmorigan and his surviving henchmen were forced to flee, with the criminal leader also losing his [[credit]]s.\n\nDespite his adversarial encounters with Hondo and the Spectres, he joined forces with these two parties in order to loot treasure from an Imperial [[Class four container transport]]. Azmorigan and Hondo were solely motivated by pecuniary gain but managed to convince the rebels to help them after pointing out the presence of [[proton bomb]]s aboard the ship. Following a harrowing mission, Azmorigan, Hondo, and the Spectres were able to obtain their goals.\n\n==Biography==\n===Dealing with Calrissian===\n[[File:Azmorigan_DoR.png|thumb|left|250px|Azmorigan counting credits.]]\nA [[Jablogian]] [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Nar Shaddaa]],<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> Azmorigan was a criminal leader who operated in the [[Outer Rim Territories]] near the [[planet]] [[Lothal]]. He owned a [[C-ROC Gozanti-class light cruiser|C-ROC ''Gozanti''-class light cruiser]] called ''[[Merchant One]]''<ref name=\"IA\" /> and traveled as a treacherous marauder to find the richest pickings.<ref name=\"VE\">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref> He was served by several masked minions and was a known associate of the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]]. In [[4 BBY]],{{Fact}} Azmorigan did business with the [[The galaxy|galactic]] entrepreneur [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], trading him a [[puffer pig]] in return for the [[Twi'lek]] [[pilot]] [[Hera Syndulla]]. Syndulla, however, outsmarted Azmorigan and knocked him and his men out. She then escaped from the criminals' ship in an [[escape pod]] and returned to her own ship, the ''[[Ghost]]'', where she rejoined Calrissian and her [[Spectres|rebel crew]].<ref name=\"IA\" />\n\nSeeking vengeance, Azmorigan then [[Mission to Lando Calrissian's farm|tracked]] Syndulla and Calrissian down to a plot of land that Calrissian had purchased from Vizago, and demanded the return of the Twi'lek and the pig as well as the ''Ghost'' and its crew. When the rebel crew refused, Azmorigan and his men attacked them, sparking a gun battle. During the battle, [[Azmorigan's henchmen]] were overwhelmed by the the crew of the ''Ghost'' with several being killed. At the height of the fighting, Azmorigan took the [[Lasat]] rebel [[Garazeb Orrelios]] hostage and offered to spare him if the rebels surrendered Calrissian. However, the astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]] fired on him with the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' turret cannon; knocking him to the ground. Now at the mercy of the rebels, Azmorigan accepted an ultimatum from Syndulla to leave Calrissian's compound. He and his two remaining henchmen then fled into the night.<ref name=\"IA\" />\n\n===Settling old scores===\nLater that year, Azmorigan ordered a shipment of five power generators from Cikatro Vizago. The two gangsters arranged to rendezvous on the icy planet of [[Nixus]]. However, on the way, Vizago was incapacitated and imprisoned in his own ship the ''[[Broken Horn]]'' by the [[Weequay]] pirate [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Later, Ohnaka was joined by the rebels [[Ezra Bridger]] and Chopper, who had encountered Azmorigan during an earlier adventure with Calrissian. Upon arriving at Nixus, Azmorigan took Ohnaka and Ezra captive since he distrusted them showing up without Vizago; possibly intending to double cross Vizago originally if the opportunity presented itself. Azmorigan knew that the [[Rang Clan]] had placed a [[bounty]] on Ohnaka's head and recognized Ezra as part of the [[Spectres|rebel group]] that had aided Calrissian.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\">{{Rebels|Brothers of the Broken Horn}}</ref>\n\nAzmorigan ordered his men to load Ezra and Ohnaka into a loading dolly, where they would deposited into space. He was delighted because he had a chance to settle the score with Ezra and eliminate Ohnaka and also to seize their generators. However, Chopper attacked him with the fifth crate, knocking his men over. During the ensuing blaster battle, Azmorigan opened fire on Chopper. Taking advantage of the confusion, Ezra broke free and used his [[Ezra Bridger's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to shoot stun shots at the henchmen. Chopper also entered the fray by firing two blasters at Azmorigan and stealing his [[credit]]s. After rescuing Ohnaka, Ezra, Chopper and the pirate escaped into space on the ''Broken Horn''.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\n===Treasure hunting on Wynkahthu===\n[[File:Wynkahthu_recovery_team.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Azmorigan, Hondo, Melch, and the Spectres]]\nIn [[2 BBY]], Azmorigan obtained the flight plan and manifest for an Imperial [[Class four container transport]] transiting near the planet [[Wynkahthu]]. He learned that the transport was ferrying [[proton bomb]]s and treasure from worlds plundered by the Empire. Azmorigan struck a deal with Hondo to raid the cargo ship. Hondo and his [[Ugnaught]] crew managed to disable the ship with [[ion mine]]s. However, the ship drifted into the stormy upper atmosphere of Wynkahthu. After losing most of his Ugnaught crew with the exception of [[Melch]], Hondo solicited the services of the Lothal rebel cell.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\">{{Rebels|The Wynkahthu Job}}</ref>\n\nUpon boarding the rebels' ship ''[[Ghost]]'', Azmorigan received a cold reception from the Spectres particularly Hera, who remembered him as the sack of \"[[bantha fodder]]\" who bought her from Lando. Azmorigan responded that she was the feisty one who had hit him with a tray and claimed that he still technically \"owned\" her. The Spectres, at the urging of Ezra, agreed to support Hondo's plan after learning about the presence of proton bombs on the container transport; something that the rebellion needed desperately. The rebels agreed to take the bombs while Hondo and Azmorigan agreed to divide the spoils from the treasures among themselves.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nDue to his overweight physique, Azmorigan struggled to climb down the stairs which led to the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cargo bay. Hondo tried to dissuade his partner by claiming that he was frail. However, Azmorigan threatened not to let the recovery mission go ahead if he was not part of the recovery team. The rebels managed to leap onto the hull of the cargo ship and board it through a manhole. Inside, Azmorigan, Hondo, and the rebels encountered a furious Melch, who attacked Hondo for abandoning him. At the insistence of the rebel team's leader Zeb, Hondo revealed that he had made an unsuccessful attempt to board the cargo ship.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nLater, Azmorigan, Hondo, and the rebels managed to find their way to the cargo bay. While Azmorigan and Hondo helped themselves to the loot, the rebels used the ship's grappling guns to fire tow cables onto the ''Ghost''. They then began loading the proton bombs aboard their ship. While the rebels were loading, Azmorigan was accosted by a [[DT-series sentry droid]], which had been reactivated when the rebels' [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] reactivated the ship's power plant. He was locked in the ship's brig. When Zeb went to find him, he too was taken captive and [[stun|stunned]] by the droid.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nEzra and Chopper managed to free Azmorigan and Zeb from the brig. Together, the four made their way back to the cargo bay only to encounter the sentry droid. Despite Zeb's orders to keep low, Azmorigan disabled the droid with Ezra's [[blaster pistol]] and loudly exclaimed that he was a \"hero.\" However, his actions activated the four remaining sentry droids, which pursued the rebels, Hondo, and Azmorigan. While the rebels fought the sentry droids, Azmorigan and Hondo raced on their treasure chests back to the ''Ghost''. The rebels and their confederates managed to escape the droids before the cargo ship crashed into the vortex and exploded.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nOnce aboard the ''Ghost'', Azmorigan and Hondo fought over their treasure chests only to discover that Melch had smuggled himself aboard one of them. At Hera's insistence, Azmorigan, Hondo, and Melch returned to Hondo's [[Sentinel-class landing craft|stolen Imperial landing craft]] with their loot.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Merchant_One_XWM_Mariusz_Gandzel.png|thumb|left|250px|Azmorigan's personal starship, ''Merchant One'']]\nAzmorigan was extremely lazy, only walking when necessary. He loved to eat, this being one of his favorite pastimes, and he had a large number of men to do things for him. He was also impatient, hot tempered,<ref name=\"Epic Battles\">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Visual Guide: Epic Battles]]''</ref> and rather gullible. As a criminal leader, Azmorigan was vindictive and unforgiving towards those who had wronged him.<ref name=\"IA\" /> On one occasion, he and his henchmen invaded Calrissian's compound on Lothal and attempted to kill him after Calrissian swindled him. On another occasion, Azmorigan ordered the attempted killing of the [[Weequay]] pirate [[Hondo Ohnaka]] and the rebel [[Ezra Bridger]] since the two had wronged him in the past.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" />\n\nAzmorigan had a weakness for the female gender, a trait that was exploited by Lando Calrissian during his scam to obtain a [[puffer pig]], in which he sold the rebel Hera Syndulla to the lustful Azmorigan. Azmorigan reprimanded Syndulla for wearing preposterous attire, implying he wanted to see more of her body. He also referred to the young [[Twi'lek]] as his \"property.\" Though he offered to share his food with her, his way of eating was so unpleasant that Syndulla excused herself, saying that she had lost her appetite.<ref name=\"IA\" />\n\nWhile Azmorigan had limited combat skills, he was able to take [[Garazeb Orrelios]] hostage on one occasion with a blaster.<ref name=\"IA\" /> However, he often let his henchmen do most of the fighting.<ref name=\"Brothers of the Broken Horn\" /> Due to his weight, Azmorigan had trouble walking and exercising for long distances. However, he was willing to endure hardship in order to reap pecuniary gain. Azmorigan also had a high-pitched singing voice. While Azmorigan was known to be cowardly, he once single-handed took on an Imperial sentry droid out of fear. Destroying the droid gave Azmorigan the sense of accomplishment that he was a \"hero.\"<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nAzmorigan was motivated by profit and fought with Hondo for his share of stolen treasure from an Imperial cargo ship. Despite his antagonistic earlier encounter with the Spectres, he was willing to work with them in order to obtain treasure for himself.<ref name=\"The Wynkahthu Job\" />\n\nDespite his lazy nature, Azmorigan was nonetheless able to manage an [[RK-3 blaster|RK-3]] [[blaster pistol]].<ref name=\"IA\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:EarlyJabba-ROJSketchbook.png|thumb|right|200px|An early drawing of Jabba that was later reworked into Azmorigan]]\nAzmorigan first appeared as a minor antagonist in the [[Disney XD]] animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. He was voiced by [[James Hong]] in \"[[Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array]],\" the tenth episode of the series' [[Star Wars Rebels Season One|first season]]. Hong later reprised his role as Azmorigan in \"[[Brothers of the Broken Horn]],\" the fourth episode of the series' [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|second season]].
