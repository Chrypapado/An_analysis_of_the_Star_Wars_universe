It kept an [[armored rat]] as a pet and used traps made from metal claws to trap such creatures as [[spider-roach]]s. On one occasion, it caught the children [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] in one such trap, after they became lost in the undercity. He attached some chains to the cage and dragged in into his den. After feeding his armored rat with a recently caught spider-roach, he turned his attention to the two twins, who he planned to eat. However, they used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to open the cage, and ran away. The ogre was furious and set his armored rat free, which then chased after them. However, it was unsuccessful in catching them.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']] {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscani ogres]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
