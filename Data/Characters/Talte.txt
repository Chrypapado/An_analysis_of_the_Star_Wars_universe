The spacer questioned [[Angela]], the wife of one of the missing hikers [[Ilyamo]], to learn more about the trail. The spacer also interrogated [[Myron Beech]] who organized the hiking trail.<ref name=\"SWG:GI\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Disappearances: Gathering Information|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer later met [[Jareck Arned]] who was living a solitary life in the mountains and searched his [[Valley home|home]] that was located on the hiking trail.<ref name=\"SWG:DASL\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=other}}Legacy Quest: \"Disappearances: A Solitary Life\" on Corellia</ref> However, another group of people suddenly disappeared.
