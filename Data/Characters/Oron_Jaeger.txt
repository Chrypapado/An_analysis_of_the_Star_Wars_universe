At the end of the war, when [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Krayt]] [[Attack on Emperor Fel|overthrew]] [[Roan Fel]] and declared himself [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]], Jaeger and the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] feigned loyalty to [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Krayt's Empire]] but remained secretly aligned with Fel's [[Empire-in-exile]]. In [[137 ABY]], during the [[Second Imperial Civil War]], Jaeger was present on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] when Fel returned and [[Fall of Bastion|reclaimed]] the Imperial stronghold, and the general welcomed the [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] to Bastion. [[Standard month/Legends|Months]] later, after the Empire-in-exile formed an alliance with the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]] led by [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]], the [[One Sith|Sith]]&ndash;Imperials [[Final Protocol|poisoned]] the planet [[Dac]] with [[viral spore]]s, which completely devastated the world within a [[Standard week/Legends|week]]. Jaeger assisted Stazi and his forces in the [[Evacuation of Dac|evacuation efforts]] on Dac, helping to save nearly 20 percent of the planet's population.\n\n==Biography==\n===Fall of Bastion===\n{{Quote|Tell me&mdash;have all the troops made it back as planned?\"''<br />\"''The 908th has been delayed, but the others were all slowly rotated in&mdash;as per your orders.|Roan Fel and Oron Jaeger|Legacy (2006) 3}}\nOron Jaeger, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], served the [[Fel Empire]] as a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] leading up to the [[Sith&ndash;Imperial War]]. He eventually rose to the rank of [[General/Legends|general]] and also became the [[Stormtrooper commander/Legends|commander]] of the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] of stormtroopers&mdash;an elite [[Legion/Legends|unit]] whose history dated back to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], which occurred more than a [[22 BBY/Legends|century prior]]. As the 501st Legion's commander, Jaeger displayed efficiency for organization and tactics that were based on movement; he also earned a reputation as having a perpetual \"bird's-eye view\" of a battleground, especially during the thick of combat.<ref name=\"LE CG\" />\n\n[[File:Fel_and_Jaeger.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jaeger and Emperor Roan Fel on Bastion]]\nDuring the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]&ndash;Imperial War, in which Fel's Empire waged battle with the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]], Jaeger participated in a [[Battle of Corulag|conflict]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]], where he suffered an injury to his head.

After the soldiers refused to comply, Kiefer attempted to [[Death/Legends|execute]] Fel, but before he could, Jaeger had one of his [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] shoot and kill the Lieutenant. Jaeger welcomed Fel to Bastion and informed the Emperor that all the forces loyal to him were on-planet, with the exception of the [[908th Stormtrooper Division]]. Soon afterward, Jaeger was informed by Imperial contacts on [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]] that the planet's [[Imperial Mission]] had been destroyed; that Fel's daughter, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Marasiah Fel]], was missing; and that her [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]], [[Elke Vetter]], was dead. After Jaeger relayed the news to Fel, the [[Imperial Knight]]s [[Antares Draco]] and [[Ganner Krieg]] volunteered to rescue the Princess; however, Fel forbade them from undertaking such a mission. Draco and Krieg eventually acted against the Emperor's orders and [[Skirmish on Vendaxa|successfully rescued]] Princess Fel.<ref>[[Legacy (2006) 7|''Legacy'' (2006) 7]]</ref> During this time, Emperor Fel and Jaeger began planning to overthrow [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt and his Empire,<ref name=\"CSWE: Jaeger, Oron\" /> and Jaeger continued working with Fel over the next several [[Standard month/Legends|months]].<ref>[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]</ref>\n\n===Evacuation of Dac===\n{{Quote|Glad to see you, General Jaeger.

Stazi requested aid for the [[Evacuation of Dac|evacuation]] of the planet [[Dac]], which the [[One Sith|Sith]] had [[Final Protocol|infected]] with a [[Viral spore|deadly pathogen]] that would eliminate all life on the planet within a [[Standard week/Legends|week]]. During the discussion, Jaeger warned that Stazi was being lured into a trap by the Sith&ndash;Imperials and maintained that he could not help Stazi's forces without the Emperor's permission, thus forcing Stazi to act alone.<ref name=\"Legacy 47\" />\n\nJaeger nevertheless assumed personal command of a strike force of [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyers]] and took them one [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] jump away from Dac in preparation for the Emperor's authority to attack. Immediately after receiving Fel's consent, Jaeger and his [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] emerged from hyperspace to aid Stazi in fighting the [[Outer Rim Third Fleet]], which was loyal to Krayt's Empire, and the arrival of Jaeger's forces caused the Sith&ndash;Imperials to retreat from the battle. As the Sith&ndash;Imperials fled from Dac, Jaeger informed Stazi that he would pursue the escaping [[Starship/Legends|ships]]; however, Stazi requested that all of Jaeger's available [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttles]] aid the civilians awaiting rescue on Dac's surface, and Jaeger agreed. The Alliance and Fel&ndash;Imperial forces effectively rescued nearly 20 percent of Dac's population.<ref name=\"Legacy 47\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Oron_Jaeger_LECG.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General Oron Jaeger]]\n{{Quote|The 501st&mdash;my men&mdash;were always loyal to you and are ready to serve.|Oron Jaeger, to Roan Fel|Legacy (2006) 3}}\nOron Jaeger dedicated his life to serving the Fel Empire and was fervently loyal to the government's leader, Emperor Roan Fel. After Darth Krayt usurped the Imperial throne from Fel, Jaeger and the soldiers under his command feigned allegiance with the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord's]] new Empire. He made it a priority to stay in contact with Emperor Fel, and he rotated any Imperial forces loyal to Fel to Bastion in an effort to consolidate a large military force there that could aid Fel.<ref name=\"LE CG\" /><ref name=\"CSWE: Jaeger, Oron\" />\n\nJaeger believed that the alliance between the Fel loyalists and the Galactic Alliance Remnant was critical to defeating the Sith. During his conversation with Admiral Gar Stazi regarding the evacuation of Dac, he expressed his belief that the destruction of the Sith was of more paramount importance than the demise of the planet Dac and its inhabitants. However, Jaeger took the initiative to move a fleet of [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]] one hyperspace jump away from Dac and awaited Fel's permission to aid the Alliance in their evacuation efforts.<ref name=\"Legacy 47\" />\n\nJaeger possessed a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] and a [[Code cylinder/Legends|code cylinder]], and wore the uniform of a [[Moff/Legends|Moff]]. He spoke and comprehended [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] and also understood [[Binary/Legends|Binary]]. His [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] implant contained a built-in [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] and data links, which gave him the capability to relay orders at a faster pace than most military commanders.<ref name=\"LE CG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOron Jaeger was created by [[John Ostrander]] for the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series. He first appeared in the [[Legacy (2006) 3|third issue]] of [[Star Wars: Legacy: Broken|''Broken'']], the inaugural story arc, and was later featured in a single panel in ''Legacy''{{'s}} [[Legacy (2006) 23|twenty-third issue]], which was the first issue of the [[Star Wars: Legacy: Loyalties|''Loyalties'']] story arc. He was featured more prominently in the series' [[Legacy (2006) 47|forty-seventh issue]], entitled ''The Fate of Dac''. Jaeger was drawn by [[Jan Duursema]] in all his appearances. He received entries in both ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' and the ''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''; Jaeger's entry in the former states that he killed Kiefer when the Lieutenant attempted to execute Roan Fel. This contradicts the events of ''Legacy''{{'s}} third issue, which depicts one of Jaeger's stormtroopers killing Kiefer.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Oron Jaeger}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 3|''Legacy'' (2006) 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 47|''Legacy'' (2006) 47]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Stormtrooper commander/Legends|Commander]] of the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]]<ref name=\"LE CG\" />\n|years=Before [[130 ABY]]<ref name=\"CSWE: Jaeger, Oron\" />\n|before=Eventually [[CC-1119/Legends|Appo]]<ref name=\"O66\">{{InsiderCite|87|Order 66: Destroy All Jedi}}</ref>\n|before-years=&mdash;[[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]<ref name=\"O66\" />\n|after=\n|after-years=}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Oron Jaeger\n|es=Oron Jaeger\n|pl=Oron Jaeger\n|ru=\u041e\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u0433\u0435\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaeger, Oron}}\n[[Category:Admirals and generals of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fel Empire military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army generals]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers of the 501st Legion]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Empire-in-exile]]"}}}]}}}}
