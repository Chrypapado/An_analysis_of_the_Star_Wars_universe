You dusted him!|Vedd Deviss prior to initiating his attack run against a shield generator|Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo}}\n'''Vedd Deviss''' was a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] born in the swamps of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. He was a merchant and knew the backcountry of Naboo extremely well. As an exceptional guide, he could find reclusive [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]], concealed hideouts, and secret bases. He was a resourceful and encouraging ally of the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], flying with [[Bravo Flight]] pilot [[Gavyn Sykes]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Devissstrafing.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Deviss strafing a shield generator]]\nAt the time of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], Vedd Deviss was a [[Police officer/Legends|police officer]] in his home village in the swamps of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. Directly after the invasion, the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] began [[Skirmishes in the Naboo countryside|attacking]] villages to subdue resistance. Two [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Security Force]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] destroyed the Federation droids which were attacking his village. The village elder, [[Rohan Wayside]], suggested they meet Deviss. Deviss joined the two pilots in his personal [[N-X Police Cruiser/Legends|N-X Police Cruiser]].\n\nDeviss knew they could find a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], [[Borvo|Borvo the Hutt]], in the mountains. They found [[Borvo the Hutt's freighter|the smuggler's transport]] and [[Mission to the Naboo mountains|escorted]] it past attacking Federation [[Armored Assault Tank|tanks]]. After protecting the smuggler's [[N-1 assembly site|base]], Borvo gave the pilots new starfighters, and they launched an [[Disruption of Comm 4|offensive]] against the [[Trade Federation Droid Army/Legends|Trade Federation Droid Army]].\n\nWhen Deviss' wingmate [[Gavyn Sykes]] stole a gunboat to aid in [[Liberation of slave camps|liberating]] Federation [[Slavery/Legends|slave camps]], Deviss held back until he could proceed. After Sykes disabled the camp's [[Laser cannon/Legends|anti-air defenses]], Deviss strafed a [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|deflector shield generator]] and freed the rest of the prisoners. Borvo sent in transports to pick up the prisoners. The next day, after Sykes escorted more prisoners up the [[Andrevea River]], their flight leader [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Kael (officer)|Kael]] was shot down. Deviss joined in the search, although it was his wingman [[Lutin Hollis/Legends|Lutin Hollis]] who ultimately located the captain's downed [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighter]]. With his dying breath, Kael informed the crew that Borvo had betrayed them and was going to sell the prisoners. Sykes swore revenge against the Hutt.\n\nFlanking the Hutt's position on [[Porso Hill]], Vedd and Hollis held off [[Borvo the Hutt's starfighter|opposing starfighters]] while Sykes engaged the [[Borvo the Hutt's freighter|mothership]], destroying it. The pilots then joined with the mercenary [[Kol Kotha]] to [[Liberation of Camp Four|liberate another prisoner camp]]. Flying under the cover of darkness, the pilots infiltrated the valley where [[Camp Four/Legends|Camp Four]] was located. Hollis rashly gave away their position, but the pilots fought off the Federation [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I/Legends|droid starfighters]]. Deviss flew top-cover as Sykes freed the prisoners on the ground.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDeviss was a capable pilot and flew a variety of craft. After spending much time in the wilderness of Naboo in his position of police officer, Deviss became knowledgeable of smugglers in the area. He was overly enthusiastic, evidenced by his cheer when he strafed the Trade Federation slave camps. He was an excellent guide, able to locate hidden recluses. He was also resourceful and encouraging.<ref>{{LucasArtsCite|url=products/naboo/index_ie.html#|text=''Star Wars: Battle for Naboo'' official website|archivedate=20010609040717}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the [[2000]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]]'', Vedd Deviss was voiced by [[Peter Van Schaik]].
