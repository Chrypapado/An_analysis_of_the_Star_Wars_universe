Please. I need for you to take us to the Aerial Temple immediately!''\"<br/>\"''I'm on my break. Find another pilot.|Lah Kara and the boatman|The Ninth Jedi}}\nA '''boatman droid''' was stationed on the [[planet]] [[Hy Izlan]] for the purposing of ferrying [[Species|organic beings]]. Old, slow, and cantankerous, the [[Boatman droid|boatman]] greatly preferred sipping warm fluid on the [[Water|icy]] planet as opposed to doing its job. One [[Standard day|day]], however, after outlasting all the other droids of its model at its station, it reluctantly agreed to fly a desperate young [[Gender|girl]] named [[Lah Kara]] to the [[Aerial Temple]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Hy Izlan. At the temple, the unconcerned [[droid]] watched as Kara [[Skirmish on Hy Izlan|dueled]] alongside [[Jedi]] [[Juro]] and [[Ethan]] against a number of [[Sith]] acolytes.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I might as well.|The boatman, after being offered a coin in return for passage|The Ninth Jedi}}\nStationed on the [[planet]] [[Hy Izlan]] many generations after the disappearance of the [[Jedi Order]], the [[boatman droid]] was one of several designed to ferry the [[Homeworld|inhabitants]] of the [[Temperature|frigid]] world. Eventually, however, all of the other [[droid]]s fell into disrepair, leaving the single boatman to grow old alone. One [[Water|snowy]] [[Standard day|day]], it sat outside its station sipping warm fluid when a breathless young [[Gender|girl]] named [[Lah Kara]] approached aboard a [[speeder bike]]. She desperately requested that it take both her and her droid [[Four-Nines]] to the [[Aerial Temple of Hy Izlan]], but the boatman, content with itself, informed her that it was on a break and that she should find another [[pilot]]. Still Kara insisted and offered the boatman a [[gold]]en [[coin]], prompting it to reluctantly agree to the girl's request.<ref name=\"The Ninth Jedi\" />\n\nAboard a [[starship]], the boatman flew through the [[atmosphere]] of Hy Izlan, soaring past [[asteroid]]s made up of [[kyber crystal]]s. After arriving at the temple and thanking the droid for his assistance, Kara departed the ship and delivered a set of [[lightsaber]]s constructed by [[Lah Zhima|her father]] to a group of six individuals who claimed to be [[Jedi]]. In reality, the sextet were actually [[Sith]], acolytes of the [[dark side of the Force]] determined to snuff out the [[Light side of the Force|light]] of the Jedi. Now armed with lightsabers, they [[Skirmish on Hy Izlan|dueled]] with Kara, as well as a Jedi aspirant named [[Ethan]] and the [[Margrave/Legends|Margrave]] [[Juro]], the ruler of Hy Izlan. The boatman droid calmly watched all of this unfurl, sipping its fluid and taking in the action. Eventually, the Sith were defeated, and the Jedi victors departed the temple abaord [[Juro's starship]].<ref name=\"The Ninth Jedi\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Quote|Nice moves.|The droid admires Kara's fighting skills.|The Ninth Jedi}}\nA [[Color|red]]-plated boatman droid with a grey [[sensor]], it became old and abrasive on Hy Izlan. The boatman had a fondness for quietly sipping fluid and operated on its own [[time]], valuing its own comfort over the needs of its customers. Nevertheless, when offered the choice of sitting alone on the planet or earning a coin from Lah Kara, the droid chose to take the [[Currency|money]]. At the Aerial Temple, the droid politely refused Kara's thanks for the flight, and watched in quiet admiration as she fought against the Sith. Physically, it was a slow and clunky walker, but the boatman possessed enough skill as a pilot to fly through the rocky atmosphere of Hy Izlan.<ref name=\"The Ninth Jedi\" />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Quote|Something's coming.''\"<br/>\"''Do you think it's the margrave's ship?|Sith acolytes [[Niizo]] and [[Roden]] mistake the boatman's ship for that of the margrave.|The Ninth Jedi}}\nThe droid possessed a [[Teapot/Canon|teapot]] that it used to serve itself fluid in a small cup, which was designed with a drinking tube to accommodate the boatman's \"[[mouth]].\" It also oversaw several starships at the ferry station.<ref name=\"The Ninth Jedi\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe boatman droid was introduced in \"[[The Ninth Jedi]],\" a short film created by [[Production IG]] for the [[Disney+]] anthology anime series ''[[Star Wars: Visions]]'',<ref name=\"The Ninth Jedi\" /> released on [[September 22]], [[2021]].<ref name=\"Special Look Video Description\">{{SWYoutube|b9Gr9gKFxpE|STAR WARS: VISIONS &#124; SPECIAL LOOK &#124; DISNEY+|archivedate=20210703230610}}</ref> The boatman was voiced by [[Ch\u014d]] in the original Japanese cast and [[JP Karliak]] in the English dub.
