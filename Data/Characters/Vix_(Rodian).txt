He was an avid fan of the local [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop races]] and visited a [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|local cantina]] in Iziz to watch them. There, the Rodian talked of nothing but the [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] races. Even after an attack on [[Meetra Surik]] in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] of the [[Onderonian military]], Vix was unaware that anything had happened and continued watching the races.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]], Vix lived in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] during the [[Onderon Civil War]]<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> in [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> He was a frequent patron of a [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|local cantina]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nWhen the former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Meetra Surik]] visited the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] during her stay on Onderon, she spoke with Vix. Their conversation consisted of nothing but Vix detailing his love of [[Swoop racing/Legends|swoop racing]]. Eventually Surik gave up and ceased speaking with the Rodian. When [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]], an officer of the [[Onderonian military]], and his men interrupted Surik's meeting with the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kavar]], Vix paid no attention to the commotion going on around him and continued to watch the [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] races.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nVix enjoyed going to the local Iziz cantina and watching the swoop races there. He hoped to one day become a great swoop racer from watching them. Vix's speech patterns were very basic, and he almost never spoke in full sentences or with proper grammar. Vix often referred to himself in third person as well. He had [[Color/Legends|black]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and green skin.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVix appears in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]], as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] with whom the player may interact while visiting Onderon. He offers no quests or useful information, and the player is not required to speak with him at any point of the game.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vix\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
