She survived the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star's]] [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of her homeworld by being off-planet trying to depose a witness. The loss of the peaceful planet helped motivate her to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance]] soon afterward.\n\n==Biography==\nEttyk rose through [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken's]] [[Alliance Intelligence|intelligence organizations]] to the rank of [[Commander/Legends|Commander]]. Circa [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], the Ettyk was working on the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|recently liberated]] capital planet [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and upon being offered the job of prosecutor on behalf of the [[Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic|New Republic Armed Forces]] in the [[Trial of Tycho Celchu]], immediately signed on, despite having not prosecuted a case in seven years.\n\nThe commander presented seemingly overwhelming evidence that [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Tycho Celchu]] was guilty of the murder of [[Corran Horn]], and of [[Treason/Legends|treason]] against the New Government. The politically-motivated case (being used by the government to show they could be as hard on Human criminals as they could on aliens in the face of the [[Krytos virus]]) seemed almost impossible for defense attorney [[Flight officer]] [[Nawara Ven]] to win, even with Ettyk using mostly circumstancial evidence, a testament to her legal skills.\n\nEttyk, however, dropped the charges when Corran Horn escaped from ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]'' and [[General/Legends|General]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]] revealed his own knowledge of Celchu's innocence. The commander made her apologies to Celchu.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Halla Ettyk\n|fi=Halla Ettyk\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ettyk, Halla}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance Intelligence members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Legal professionals]]\n[[Category:New Republic Intelligence personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
