So you wanna talk with Borvo? Well, that ain't easy. You wanna help us out, then maybe I'll vouch for ya?|Borvo's guard, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA '''guard''' was a [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] male employed by [[Borvo]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|One of our most trusted guys! He even trained me. Wait, you're not a cop are you? You take out Frangee and that'll prove you're not a rat snitch yourself.|Borvo's guard, to a spacer about Niksel Frangee|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nWhen the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] first began working for [[Borvo|Borvo the Hutt]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], he was trained by [[Niksel Frangee]] one of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]'s most trusted employees. After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], the Trandoshan had become Borvo's personal guard. He was based in the [[Moenia/Legends|Moenia]] [[Moenia Cantina|Cantina]] which acted as the Hutt's base of operations for his business ventures on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] Naboo.<ref name=\"SWG:BG\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> [[Dagorel]], one of Borvo's thugs, was shot in an ambush during a mission in the [[Paitnnu Wetlands]] and severely injured. The guard quickly hired a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to find him, give him a [[Medpac/Legends|medpac]] and escort him back to the Moenia. Borvo's guard later found out that Dagorell was set up by Niksel Frangee, a undercover officer in the [[Corellian Security Force]] and hired the spacer again to murder Frangee.<ref name=\"SWG:BG\" /> The spacer took Frangee's detective badge and Borvo's guard ordered the spacer to go on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] to pass himself off as Frangee. During his six years in infiltration, all of Frangee's direct superiors had retired and been replaced. Thus, nobody in the CorSec knew how Frangee looked like at the moment of his death.<ref name=\"SWG:BGATTC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Borvo's Guard - A Trip To Corellia|Naboo}}</ref> The spacer met one of the CorSec senior officers, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Thale Dustrunner]], in the [[Coronet Capitol]]. Dustrunner fell for the ruse and took the spacer for the long lost agent. He ordered him to protect [[Aldalad]], a witness who wanted to testify against Borvo, and [[Maerzen]], who had discovered evidence against Borvo the Hutt. The spacer killed both of them and returned to Borvo's guard, leaving the CorSec  without any evidence against the Hutt crime lord.<ref name=\"SWG:BC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Bluffing CorSec|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBorvo's guard appeared as a non-player character in the video game ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:BG\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011.<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Borvo's guard was part of the Borvo the Hutt questline on Naboo in the original game: ''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided''.<ref name=\"SWG:AED\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref> The quests involving Borvo's guard were extensively revamped with the [[Star Wars Galaxies: Starter Kit|New Game Enhancements]] update in [[2005]].<ref name=\"SWG:BG\" /><ref name=\"NGE\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20081009071222}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Borvo's guard}}\n\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Nal Raka Criminal Empire]]\n[[Category:Unidentified criminals]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
