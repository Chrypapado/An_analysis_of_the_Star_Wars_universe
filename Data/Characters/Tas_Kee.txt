She moved to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and became an enforcer for the minor gangster [[Hat Lo/Legends|Hat Lo]]. Kee was skilled in concealing weapons.\n\n==Biography==\nTas Kee started working as one of the gangster [[Hat Lo/Legends|Hat Lo]]'s bodyguards. Lo used a group of bodyguards to protect him against the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]]. Kee was strong in hiding weapons, even for sensors installed in Coruscant's lower regions. She was often employed in the vicinity of the [[Outlander Club/Legends|Outlander Club]] and other [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]] clubs to defend Lo's interests.\n\nUnlike most female [[Weequay/Legends|Weequay]], Kee did not shave her head [[Hair/Legends|hair]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTas Kee is unlikely to be seen in the Outlander and was placed in the Outlander just like Hat Lo via a [[retcon]]. She was played by an uncredited extra.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Attack of the Clones: The Visual Dictionary]]''\n*{{FFCite|96|OUT 2, ''Outlander Club Patrons''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|lowlechred|Ch'red, Lowle|archivedate=20100209232338}}\n*{{DB|character|taskee|Kee, Tas|archivedate=20110517074409}}\n*{{DB|character|ayyvida|Vida, Ayy|archivedate=20110517074759}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tas Kee\n|es=Tas Kee\n|hu=Tas Kee\n|nl=Tas Kee\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kee, Tas}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Weequays]]"}}}]}}}}
