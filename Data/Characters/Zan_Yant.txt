In [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], the [[Battle of Drongar]] began, and the Republic needed surgeons. Yant was conscripted and assigned to the [[Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7|Rimsoo Seven]] facility on [[Drongar/Legends|Drongar]]. There, Yant had met [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] head surgeon [[Jos Vondar]] and became fast friends with him.\n\n[[File:Medstar.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Yant plays Sabacc on Drongar.]]\nA good friend of [[Barriss Offee/Legends|Barriss Offee]], and a talented musician, Yant's outlet to escape the horror of the war around him was to play his [[quetarra]]. Yant entertained his friends by playing a variety of musical works. Doing so calmed his mind and helped him cope with the traumas of everyday. Yant was very protective of his quetarra, but once when intoxicated, jumped up and down on the quetarra case with the quetarra inside to demonstrate the case's strength.\n\nTragedy struck when the Rimsoo unit was attacked and forced to evacuate. Yant lost his quetarra in the chaos, which the [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]] reporter [[Den Dhur]] had recovered at great risk to his own life. Yant was both surprised and touched at Dhur's heroics. Before Yant could thank Dhur, however, an explosion occurred. A piece of shrapnel lodged into his brain stem, killing him instantly.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[MedStar I: Battle Surgeons]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{InsiderCite|83|MedStar: Intermezzo}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[MedStar II: Jedi Healer]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]'' {{1stp}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zan Yant\n|es=Zan Yant\n|pl=Zan Yant\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yant, Zan}}\n[[Category:Galactic Republic military personnel]]\n[[Category:Healers and doctors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Talusians]]\n[[Category:Zabrak]]"}}}]}}}}
