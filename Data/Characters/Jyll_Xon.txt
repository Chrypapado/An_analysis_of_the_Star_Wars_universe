When most of the Cartel's personnel had been transferred to their [[Metatheran Cartel jungle base|base in the jungle]], she and her supervisor, [[Manod Fea]], were the only employees working in those offices. Although Fea left the office for two hours every day, Xon remained there full-time.<ref name=\"AR\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nXon was not exceptionally bright. She was capable of doing her job, but she made lots of notes and memos to herself and kept her passcodes on a sheet taped beneath her desk. Her extra-wide smile sometimes scared young children, literally stretching from ear to ear. She was allergic to several of [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin's]] plants, with [[Jo tree]]s causing her to fall unconscious and convulse, though it was not life threatening. Despite these allergies, she loved flowers, and her significant other back on [[Caarimon]] regularly had flowers delivered to her.<ref name=\"AR\" />\n\nXon wore a hidden transmitter on her left wrist that could summon Metatheran Cartel security forces.<ref name=\"AR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Revelation]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Belly of the Beaast]]''\n*''[[Paarty On!]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Xon, Jyll}}\n[[Category:Caarimon residents]]\n[[Category:Caarites]]\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Metatheran Cartel members]]"}}}]}}}}
