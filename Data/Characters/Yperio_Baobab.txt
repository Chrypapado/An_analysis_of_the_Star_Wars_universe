A [[Droid/Legends|droid]] programmer by trade, he was considered to be the father of modern-day [[Binary/Legends|droidspeak]] by [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] standards.\n\n==Biography==\nA member of the prestigious [[Baobab Merchant Fleet|merchant fleet]]-owning [[Baobab family]], Yperio was a cyberphilologist who lived around [[200 BBY/Legends|200 BBY]]. During his lifetime, he greatly expanded upon existing electronic code-based [[Droid/Legends|droid]] languages such as [[CBell-1]], with the outcome being the ability for the automatons to recall and pass on many different types of sensory-gathered data to other droids and [[Computer/Legends|computers]]. The resulting language was referred to as [[Bab-Prime]].\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide (real-life book)|''Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide'']] {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baobab, Yperio}}\n[[Category:Baobab family]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Manda residents]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
