Although overly confident of the speed of their A-Wings Konnair as [[Blue Nine/Legends|Blue Nine]] and her [[Wingmate/Legends|wingman]] [[Tetengo Noor]] ([[Blue Ten/Legends|Blue Ten]]) lost the race to their assigned scouting point to the Wraith's [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-Wings]], claiming they had to go back to the base to retrieve Noor's dinner. Konnair subsequently helped fleeing transports buy time to escape by impersonating the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] through flying in close to her wingman while continually shifting shield strength to hide the sensor profile of their A-wings.\n\nLater she played the role of [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] using an encryption which was known that Zsinj's forces had already cracked. This ploy succeeded in luring away the capital ship. Later in the hunt for Zsinj, Konnair was [[Polearm Squadron|Polearm]] Seven in the A-Wing Squadron assigned to the ''[[Mon Remonda]]''.\n\nKonnair was from Coruscant, and had multiple tattoos in shades of blue, most noticeably a starflare [[Tattoo/Legends|tattoo]] covering one eye. She was often quiet at pilot gatherings due to perceived mistrust from other New Republic pilots towards Coruscant natives. She survived the final battle against [[Iron Fist (Executor-class)|''Iron Fist'']] and received a commendation at the end of the campaign, after which she and the remnants of her squadron were reassigned to Coruscant for rebuilding.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dorset Konnair\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Konnair, Dorset}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:New Republic Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
