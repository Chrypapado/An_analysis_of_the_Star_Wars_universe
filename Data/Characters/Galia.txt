But that is over. The shadow has been broken. Let go of the past. ''You are free!''|Arca Jeth|Tales of the Jedi 2}}\n'''Galia''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] and the [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] of the [[Inner Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] during the era of the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]]. Growing up under the pall of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]&mdash;both of her parents, [[King/Legends|King]] [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]] and Queen [[Amanoa]], were [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]]ists&mdash;Galia lived during the turbulent period of Onderonian history known as the [[Beast Wars]], when the government of the walled [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] battled [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] criminals known as the [[Beast Riders]] who used [[drexl]] warbeasts as mounts. At some point, she met Beast Rider leader [[Oron Kira]], and the two fell in love. Knowing that the [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] of Onderon and a [[Beast-Lord]] could never be together, they [[Raid on the Iziz Royal Palace|faked]] a kidnapping in [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]] and went to [[Kira Fortress|Kira's fortress]] in the wilderness beyond Iziz's walls to be [[Marriage/Legends|married]]. However, the [[Binding Ceremony of Oron Kira and Galia|ceremony]] was interrupted by three [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]&mdash;brothers [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic]] and [[Cay Qel-Droma]], and the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Tott Doneeta]]&mdash;who were sent by Amanoa to retrieve her daughter. After telling the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] their story, Galia and Kira formulated a plan with the Knights to try to convince Amanoa to end the Beast Wars peacefully.\n\nHowever, Amanoa rejected their overtures, and they were forced to enact their backup plan, in which a large [[Beast Rider army]] [[Battle of Iziz|attacked]] Iziz. With the help of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]], the Beast Riders were victorious in the final battle of the Beast Wars, with the Queen [[Death/Legends|perishing]] at the conclusion of the fighting. Galia and Kira consecrated their marriage under the laws of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and became the new [[Onderon Royal Family|monarchs]] of Onderon. However, their battles were not at an end, as [[3998 BBY|two years later]], [[Naddist]] cult members&mdash;like Galia's parents, worshipers of former [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Freedon Nadd]]&mdash;led a [[Freedon Nadd Uprising|rebellion]] against their rule. Although the [[darksider]]s briefly managed to drive Galia and Kira out of Iziz, the Naddists were ultimately [[Second Battle of Onderon|defeated]], and peace once again reigned on Onderon. In [[3996 BBY]], Galia and her husband faced another menace; a [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] attacked Onderon in one of the closing [[Battle of Onderon (Great Sith War)|battles]] of the Great Sith War, but the Mandalorians were defeated. Galia's descendants went on to rule Onderon for thousands of [[Standard year/Legends|years]] after her eventual death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Ascension to the throne===\n{{Quote|Galia&hellip; my only daughter&hellip; how ''dare'' you betray us?

Knowing that [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]] between the [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] of Onderon and a [[Beast-Lord]] was forbidden, she and Kira devised a plan to run away together, in which she would be \"abducted\" by a team of Beast Riders. She would then stay with Kira in the wilds beyond Iziz's walls, as she had become tired of living under the pall of the dark side.<ref name=\"beastwars2\" />\n\n[[File:OronGaliaBinding.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Galia, at her marriage to Oron Kira]]\nIn [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], a group of three [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]]&mdash;brothers [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic]] and [[Cay Qel-Droma]], and the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Tott Doneeta]]&mdash;came to Onderon on a mission to broker a peaceful end to the Beast Wars. Galia and her mother met with the three [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] in the throne room of the Royal Palace, and it was there that Galia and Kira put their plan into action.<ref name=\"beastwars1\" /> Kira and another Beast Rider, [[Gobee]],<ref name=\"audio\">[[Tales of the Jedi (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi'' audio drama]]</ref> [[Raid on the Iziz Royal Palace|broke through]] the throne room's [[Window/Legends|windows]] on their drexl warbeast and, covered by several waves of reinforcements, successfully made it to the Princess's hiding place and kidnapped her.<ref name=\"beastwars1\" /> Galia was taken back to [[Kira Fortress|Kira's fortress]], where her [[Binding Ceremony of Oron Kira and Galia|marriage]] to Oron Kira promptly began. However, the ceremony was interrupted by Doneeta and the Qel-Droma brothers, who stormed into the castle on [[Animal bond|tamed]] [[boma]] beasts, as Amanoa had sent them to retrieve her daughter. Ulic Qel-Droma was able to take hold of Galia, but when she revealed that she was willingly marrying Kira, she was released. With the conflict resolved, the Jedi were asked to stay for the wedding banquet. There, Galia, Kira, and Kira's [[Modon Kira|father]] and [[Drokko Kira|grandfather]] revealed to the Jedi the monarchy's dark side allegiance and asked the Jedi to join them in [[Battle of Iziz|one final battle]] to end the Beast Wars. Although Ulic Qel-Droma wanted to work out a peaceful solution with Amanoa, the two sides came to a compromise; Galia, Kira, and the Jedi would go to Iziz and try to broker peace with the Queen, but, if that attempt failed, the Kiras would lead a great [[Beast Rider army]] against Iziz.<ref name=\"beastwars2\" />\n\nIn the meeting with the Queen, their peaceful overtures failed. Amanoa declared that the Princess had betrayed her and rejected her daughter's relationship with Kira. Despite Galia's plea that her marriage to the Beast Rider could mark the beginning of a new golden age for Onderon, Amanoa called the power of the dark side down upon their group. Oppressed by the power of [[Sith magic]] and under attack by palace guards, Galia led her husband and the Jedi to refuge in<ref name=\"beastwars2\" /> her father's old [[Ommin's laboratory|laboratory]].<ref name=\"audio\" /> With Cay Qel-Droma still stuck in the throne room, Ulic decided to go back for him, telling Doneeta to escort Galia and Kira to his [[Starship/Legends|starship]], the ''[[Nebulon Ranger]]''.<ref name=\"beastwars2\" /> However, instead of joining his wife and Doneeta on their trek to the ship, Kira left to join the battle.<ref name=\"audio\" /> The Beast Rider [[Army/Legends|army]] began their assault but soon found themselves overwhelmed by Amanoa's [[Waves of darkness|dark power]]. Just as the Beast Riders seemed to be defeated, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Arca Jeth]], the teacher of Doneeta and the Qel-Droma brothers, arrived in his ship, the ''[[SunGem]]'', and turned the tide of the battle with his [[battle meditation]] [[Force power/Legends|ability]], a development that Galia observed from Iziz's ramparts. Galia and Doneeta were soon joined by Kira and the Qel-Droma brothers as Jeth landed nearby. The Jedi Master led them into the deepest sublevels of the Iziz Royal Palace to find Amanoa; they finally encountered her by the [[Freedon Nadd's sarcophagus|sarcophagus]] of Freedon Nadd. Amanoa died in Galia's arms, and Galia blamed Jeth for killing her mother. However, Jeth explained that Amanoa's power had fled her and informed Galia that she was finally free from the shadow of the dark side. With the Beast Wars over, Galia and Kira had their marriage consecrated under the laws of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], turning the two warring tribes of Onderon into one unified society. Galia took her place as Queen of Onderon, with Kira as the new king, in a ceremony that was attended by Jeth and the other Jedi.<ref name=\"beastwars2\" />\n\n===The Naddist crisis===\n{{Quote|Come to me ''daughter''&hellip; stay with your old ''father''&hellip; I ''need'' you for my work.|Ommin, to Galia|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1}}\n[[File:AmanoaFuneralProcession.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Galia and Oron Kira lead the funeral procession for Queen Amanoa and Dark Lord Freedon Nadd.]]\nAlthough the people of Onderon experienced a period of relative peace after the Beast Wars, [[3998 BBY|two years later]] the newly-minted Queen Galia and Kira faced a new crisis. Naddist cult members were in [[Freedon Nadd Uprising|open rebellion]] in Iziz, and, in an effort to reduce the dark side permeation of the city, Jeth ordered that the sarcophagi of both Freedon Nadd and Amanoa be removed from the planet and placed in a [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd|new tomb]] on the neighboring [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]]. Galia and Kira led a grand [[Funeral of Amanoa|funeral procession]] through the streets of Iziz, but the ceremony was interrupted by a Naddist strike force led by the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] warrior [[Warb Null]], who emerged suddenly through the planet's surface in a [[groundborer]] machine. The Naddist [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], comprising dissident members of the [[Royal Armed Forces]], [[First Battle of Onderon (Naddist Uprising)|laid waste]] to Galia's [[Troop/Legends|troops]]. A unit broke off to attack the Queen herself, but they were stopped by Kira and a Beast Rider team. In the end, the Naddists were able to obtain the sarcophagi, fleeing the battlefield in the groundborer once they accomplished their objective.<ref name=\"nadd1\" />\n\nFollowing the skirmish, Jeth collapsed, overwhelmed by the dark side presence he had felt during the fight. Searching for an explanation, Galia suggested they visit her father, whom Jeth thought to be dead, as she believed that he might be able to help them. Galia, Jeth, and Ulic Qel-Droma set out for Ommin's subterranean fortress, while Kira, Doneeta, Cay Qel-Droma, and the [[Vultan]] Jedi [[Oss Wilum]] stayed behind to secure the Royal Palace. However, after meeting with Ommin, they soon found themselves confronted by the [[Force ghost|spirit]] of Freedon Nadd, who had been called back from [[Chaos/Legends|Chaos]] by Galia's father. She watched as Ommin suddenly rose and attacked Jeth, knocking him unconscious and smothering him in dark side energy. The former King then turned his attention to Galia, with hopes that she would stay with him and help in his dark side work. Ulic Qel-Droma intervened but was attacked by Warb Null, whom he killed in defense of the Queen. However, while Galia and Qel-Droma were distracted by the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]], Ommin carried off the incapacitated Jeth.<ref name=\"nadd1\" />\n\nGalia and Qel-Droma escaped from Iziz's sublevels and found that the Royal Palace had been destroyed. Although Kira and the other Jedi survived the Naddist attack that razed the structure, the group was forced to flee Iziz and regroup at Kira's fortress.<ref name=\"nadd1\" /> While Galia's forces rebuilt their strength for an assault on the Naddists, the Queen received help from the Republic; due to a plea for help from Ulic Qel-Droma, the Republic sent [[Republic Military/Legends|military]] aid, including elite [[Rocket-Jumper Elite Advance Unit|Republic rocket-jumpers]], to help in their [[Second Battle of Onderon|efforts to retake Iziz]]. By the [[Time/Legends|time]] the rocket-jumpers arrived, Galia and her troops had been surrounded in the fortress, trying to make a stand alongside Kira's Beast Riders and the Jedi. The Republic troops succeeded in driving the Naddists back, and Galia and the others took the fight to Iziz. The city was ultimately retaken and the Naddists were defeated, with Ommin perishing in the battle. The sarcophagi of Amanoa and Freedon Nadd were recovered, and they were buried alongside the former King Ommin in the Dxun tomb.<ref name=\"nadd2\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 2]]</ref>\n\n===The Sith War and legacy===\n{{Quote|Oron, what are those objects in the sky?

Galia and Kira sighted the Mandalorian [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] while out on a balcony of the Royal Palace, and the King immediately departed to fight them off with his Beast Rider warriors.
