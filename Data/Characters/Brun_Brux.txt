After the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Brux's restaurant became a gathering place for those who hated the Empire.\n\n==Biography==\nBrun Brux, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], originated from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], but during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]&mdash;a conflict between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]&mdash;he lived and worked on [[The Wheel/Legends|the Wheel]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]]<ref name=\"BTR25\" /> in the [[Besh Gorgon system/Legends|Besh Gorgon system]] of the [[Mid Rim]].<ref name=\"BTR14\">''[[Beyond the Rim]]'', p. 14</ref> On the station, he ran [[Tasia's Tapcaf\u00e9]], which specialized in [[Foodstuff/Legends|food]] from his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], on a [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] deck level.<ref name=\"BTR25\" /> After the Empire's [[destruction of Alderaan]],<ref name=\"ANH\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> his [[Restaurant/Legends|restaurant]] turned into a rallying point for other [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] survivors and those harboring hatred for the Empire. Brux feared drawing the ire of the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]] and so discouraged open rebellion amongst his customers, focusing instead on collecting pieces of Alderaanian spirit and culture.<ref name=\"BTR25\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBrux was thin and [[Hair/Legends|bearded]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] he worked on the Wheel. Prior to the destruction of Alderaan, Brux was more concerned with the running of his restaurant than he was with any [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Politics/Legends|politics]]. After the loss of his homeworld, however, Brux became sad and angry, commiserating with the other survivors and anti-Imperialists who frequented his [[Tapcafe/Legends|tapcafe]]. His fear of trouble from the Imperial Security Bureau outweighed any wish for anti-Imperial action he had, and so he discouraged open rebellion amongst dissenters in his shop. Nonetheless, he hoped to one [[Standard day/Legends|day]] join the Alliance himself, although he was unsure whom to trust with such matters.<ref name=\"BTR25\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBrun Brux was first introduced in ''[[Beyond the Rim]]'', an adventure module written by [[Sterling Hershey]] in [[2013]] for the [[Fantasy Flight Games]] [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Star Wars: Edge of the Empire]]''. He was one individual with whom players could potentially interact while searching for information during the first episode of the game.<ref name=\"BTR\">''[[Beyond the Rim]]''</ref>\n\nInterviewed in [[Star Wars Insider 157|''Star Wars Insider'' 157]] for the magazine's [[Red Five (Star Wars Insider)|''Red Five'']] department, actor [[John Morton]], who played [[Dak Ralter]] in [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], named Brun Brux as one of his five favorite ''[[Star Wars]]'' freedom fighters. Morton compared Brux to actor [[Wikipedia:Humphrey Bogart|Humphrey Bogart's]] character Rick Blaine in the classic film [[Wikipedia:Casablanca (film)|''Casablanca'']], lauding Brux's wily ability to maneuver his way among the galaxy's myriad dangerous patrons all while facilitating the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"Insider 157\">{{InsiderCite|157|Red Five (Star Wars Insider)|Red Five}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Beyond the Rim]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|157|Red Five (Star Wars Insider)|Red Five}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
