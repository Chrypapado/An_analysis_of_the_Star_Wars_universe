Dol's brother [[Yeorg Captison|Yeorg]] was also a member of the Bakuran Senate, and when Dol's daughter, [[Gaeriel Captison|Gaeriel]] expressed an interest in politics, Dol helped her achieve her wishes (presumably, this help included using his position to ensure Gaeriel's acceptance into the [[Bakur Senatorial Academy]]).\n\nA year after her daughter was accepted into the Academy, the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] invaded Bakura. Both Dol and his wife were killed in the Bakuran capital city, [[Salis D'aar/Legends|Salis D'aar]], when they accidentally were caught in a firefight between Imperial and Bakuran forces.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Truce at Bakura Sourcebook]]'' {{1stm}}\n*{{DB|character|gaerielcaptison|Captison, Gaeriel|archivedate=20100309220159}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Captison, Dol}}\n[[Category:Bakuran Senators]]\n[[Category:Bakurans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
