He apprenticed himself to a Dark Lord of the Sith. After his death, his tomb became a focus of dark side energy, and so his power passed from generation to generation.|Arca Jeth|audio=TombOfFreedonNadd-TOTJ.ogg|Tales of the Jedi (audio)}}\n'''Freedon Nadd''' was an [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] prodigy whose conscious decision to embrace the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] had a significant impact on [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] events for many generations after his [[Death/Legends|death]]. Nadd's career began as a [[Padawan/Legends|student]] in [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]], but a lust for greater power caused him to [[Death/Legends|slay]] his [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]], [[Matta Tremayne]], and renounce his affiliation with the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. He fled Ossus and made his way to the heart of the old [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], where he gained an enormous wealth of dark side knowledge. He eventually followed [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to the jungle [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], where he found and [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprenticed]] himself to the ancient [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Naga Sadow/Legends|Naga Sadow]]. Sadow [[Sith training|trained]] Nadd in the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] arts, and led the young Jedi even further down the dark path. When he determined that he had learned all his [[Sith Master/Legends|Sith Master]] had to offer, Nadd used his newfound [[Force power/Legends|powers]] to destroy Sadow and left Yavin 4 behind in search of a world to conquer as his own. He proclaimed himself Dark Lord of the Sith, and used his [[Sith magic|sorcerous powers]] to subjugate the [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], where he ruled as [[King/Legends|king]] from the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] for more than a hundred years until his physical demise. His body was [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd#Onderon tomb|entombed below]] the [[Iziz Royal Palace|royal palace of Iziz]], which became a [[Force nexus|focal point]] of Sith power. Nadd's [[Force ghost|spirit]] lingered in the tomb, from whence it taught the descendants of [[Onderon Royal Family|his bloodline]] and further steeped Onderon in the miasma that was the dark side of the Force.\n\nBy [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], the exaltation of Freedon Nadd's memory was the catalyst for the [[Battle of Iziz|final battle]] of the centuries-spanning [[Beast Wars]] of Onderon, a conflict that arose between the citizens of Iziz who worshiped the deceased Dark Lord and those who had been cast out for their refusal to pledge allegiance to the Sith. A team of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] led by [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] Master [[Arca Jeth]] came to Onderon, ended the battle, and brought a temporary halt to Nadd's influence over the planet with the defeat of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Amanoa]]. However, Amanoa's [[Marriage/Legends|husband]], King [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]], reasserted Sith influence over the planet when he [[Invoke spirits|summoned Freedon Nadd's spirit]] from [[Chaos/Legends|Chaos]]. The restored [[Naddist]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]] then [[Freedon Nadd Uprising|rose up in arms]] and stole the [[Freedon Nadd's sarcophagus|Dark Lord's sarcophagus]] in [[First Battle of Onderon (Naddist Uprising)|a surprise attack]] during [[Funeral of Amanoa|Amanoa's funeral]]. Nadd revealed himself to the Jedi and participated in the capture of Arca Jeth, who was ultimately rescued by the Jedi after the defeat of King Ommin during the [[Second Battle of Onderon|final stages]] of the Naddist insurrection. Conceding failure, Nadd abandoned Ommin to the mercy of the Jedi, and his spirit was forever banished from Onderon by the power of Arca Jeth. Prior to his departure, however, Nadd happened upon [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Tetan]] [[Tetan Monarchy|socialites]] [[Aleema Keto|Aleema]] and [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal Keto]]&mdash;who had come to Onderon in search of dark side knowledge&mdash;and chose to pass the Sith teachings on to them. While [[Tomb of Freedon Nadd#Dxun tomb|Nadd's tomb was relocated]] to Onderon's [[Dxun/Legends|jungle moon]] by the Jedi, his spirit appeared to one of them, [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]], and [[Force vision/Legends|foretold]] the young Knight's destiny as a Lord of the Sith.\n\nFor [[Standard month/Legends|months]] Freedon Nadd trained the Ketos in Sith [[magic]], but his interests shifted when [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], a powerful [[Dark Jedi/Legends|fallen Jedi]] with dark side curiosities, stirred the Dark Lord's spirit from within his lunar grave. Nadd guided Kun to the ancient Sith [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Korriban]] where, through a series of trials designed to test his resolve, he decided that Exar Kun was worthy of Sith apprenticeship. Nadd then led Kun to the ancient dwellings of his own Sith Master on Yavin 4 and was pleased when Kun wholeheartedly embraced the Sith after he defeated an enormous [[Sith wyrm]] and subjugated the native [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] warriors. Finally convinced that his apprentice had become one with the dark side, Nadd revealed his need for Exar Kun to create a physical body for him through [[Sith alchemy/Legends|alchemical means]], that he might once again command the power of the Force. Kun, however, refused to entertain Nadd any longer, and in that moment betrayed him. His apprentice's strength tremendously amplified by a [[Sith amulet]], Nadd was attacked by Kun with a potent [[Force blast|blast]] of Force energy that mortally wounded the Sith spirit. Consigned to oblivion for a second time, Nadd contacted the Ketos in his final act and warned them of the threat that Exar Kun posed. He then declared that, along with Ulic Qel-Droma, the future of the Sith rested with Satal and Aleema, before fading into Chaos and dying a second death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\n====Jedi prodigy====\n{{Quote|Freedon, some things cannot be taught directly.

Upon his initial arrival, the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] on Ossus were astounded by the level of knowledge and proficiency that Nadd demonstrated through his use of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Likewise, the Masters were also impressed with his openness and efforts to attain universal harmony. Under the guidance of his teachers, Nadd learned to willingly trust in the Force and to immerse himself in its fabrics.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" /> Many of the Masters on Ossus actively took part in Nadd's training, including the progenitor of the Great Jedi Library, [[Odan-Urr/Legends|Odan-Urr]] himself.<ref name=\"FF902\" /> Nadd's teachers all agreed that he would become a Jedi Master far sooner than any other student who had come before him&mdash;if not in technique, then in understanding of the Force.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" />\n\nNadd's first test, however, came in an unexpected form when the time arose to grant several [[Padawan/Legends|apprentices]] the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. He fully believed that his own promotion to Knight was imminent, but was shocked when the Masters passed over him entirely. With their final decision made, Nadd's universe seemed to collapse around him. As he dwelt on the situation, feelings of hurt and despair began to cloud his mind. He could not understand why the Masters had not graduated him as a reward for all of the progress and hard work he had demonstrated during his time on Ossus. The fact that he had been denied the rank of Jedi Knight caused an enormous internal conflict to take place within Nadd's mind.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" />\n\n====The test of Matta Tremayne====\n{{Quote|I will become the greatest Jedi who ever lived, with or without your help.''\"<br />\"''Prove it to me.''\"<br />\"''What?

What attracted Nadd was her sense of calm and serenity with the universe, something he could feel through the Force. Believing that she could help guide him toward what the other Masters expected of him, Nadd positioned himself just outside of the garden where Tremayne was performing a flawless rhythm of lightsaber moves. Growing frustrated that the elderly woman had not acknowledged his presence, Nadd was determined to wait for her attention&mdash;however, after thirty [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]] of watching her practice without addressing him, Nadd exploded with the frustration that he had been feeling since the [[Knighting ceremony/Legends|Knighting ceremony]]. In a flurry of movement, Master Tremayne brought her lightsaber to bear mere [[Centimeter/Legends|centimeters]] away from Nadd's chest. With Nadd stunned by her sudden acknowledgment of him, Tremayne then resumed her practice motions. This action, however, caused Nadd to grow even more perturbed and he proceeded to storm away from the garden.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" />\n\n[[File:FreedonNaddHolocron-TOTJDLOTS1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Freedon Nadd as seen in a Jedi holocron.]]\nWhile Nadd hurriedly walked away, Tremayne called to him and proceeded to tell him that the Masters could not show him what needed to be done&mdash;he needed to figure out what was required for himself and learn from that experience. Tremayne further explained that until then, he would not be promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight. Nadd's frustration gave way to pure anger, and he accused Tremayne and the other Masters of being afraid to share their knowledge, and thus any power they had in the Force. Nadd then declared himself a Jedi, one who did not require the permission of the Masters. He vowed to become the greatest Jedi that ever lived, but Tremayne interrupted him with the ignition of her lightsaber, and issued a challenge for Nadd to prove to her that he deserved all the power he claimed. He responded in kind, and a [[Duel on Ossus|fierce duel]] ensued, one that saw Nadd struggling to match the pace with which his Master fought. After several passes, Nadd noticed and took advantage of an opening in Tremayne's defenses and swung his lightsaber down in a [[Death/Legends|killing]] blow. At that moment, Tremayne looked into Nadd's [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and he was filled with a sudden sense of calm. The entire confrontation had been a test manufactured by Tremayne, and Nadd realized at the last moment before his lightsaber cut into the wizened Master. He tried to halt the blade of his falling lightsaber, to no avail; Tremayne, who had deactivated her own weapon, was struck and killed instantly, leaving only her [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]] behind as she disappeared into the Force.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" />\n\nAt first, Nadd was overcome with grief over his actions as he stared at the empty robe that had just moments before contained the person of Matta Tremayne. As Nadd continued to dwell on what had transpired, however, his anger rose to new heights. He believed that the Masters had incorrectly chosen the way with which to test him, and that Tremayne had brought her own death upon herself by playing games with him. Believing that she was responsible for all the pain and rage he was feeling, Nadd continued to allow his anger to draw him further toward to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. He left Ossus in a fit of rage, believing that the Masters had engineered the tests to drive him from the Order. With thoughts of revenge clouding his judgment and fueling his anger, Nadd set [[Freedon Nadd's starship|his starship's]] coordinates for the heart of the old [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]], believing that he could find the revenge he craved by becoming a thrall of the dark side.

Nadd set a course for the jungle [[Moon/Legends|moon]], hoping to find the Lord of the Ancient Sith.<ref name=\"FF904\" />\n\nWhen he landed on Yavin 4, Nadd encountered the [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]], a Sith [[Subspecies/Legends|subspecies]] that had been [[Sith alchemy/Legends|alchemically]] bred generations ago by Sadow himself. They immediately set upon him, but the power Nadd had gained during his expedition served him well, and the Massassi deemed him worthy of Naga Sadow's consideration. Nadd was led to Yavin's [[Great Temple/Legends|Great Temple]], where he roused Sadow from his centuries-long slumber. The Dark Lord realized that Nadd was indeed a prime candidate for his dark legacy and took the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|fallen Jedi]] as his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]]. Nadd learned all he could from Sadow<ref name=\"FF904\" /> and even mastered his teachings in the [[Sith magic|magic of the Sith]].

Nadd assisted the Onderonians in the development of modern technology with which to repel the beasts, and later, those who refused to accept his Sith teachings.

When she finally discovered the relationship between Nadd and her husband, Amanoa fell into despair. Nadd, however, patiently waited as the Queen's depression turned into a loathing that gave way to anger and eventually a deep-seated hatred for Ommin's dark side devotion.

Amanoa took full control of Iziz, and her relentless persecution of the Beast Riders pushed the conflict to the fringes of all-out war.

The mausoleum was also filled with many of the Sith artifacts that had once belonged to Nadd, and had since been in the late King Ommin's possession. Several of the relics were collected and cataloged by the Jedi for shipment to the Great Jedi Library on Ossus. During that time, Nadd's ghost appeared to one of the Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma, and warned the Jedi not to interfere with the machinations of the dark side. When Qel-Droma attempted to dismiss the Sith spirit, Nadd denounced him, and also issued an ominous proclamation that told of the return of the Sith and Qel-Droma's destiny as one of them.

After learning the legend of Freedon Nadd from a [[Tedryn Holocron|Jedi holocron]], [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] abandoned his Master, [[Vodo-Siosk Baas]], and embarked on a quest to Onderon for Sith secrets.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" /> Kun's initial attempts to acquire Nadd's artifacts from the Jedi on Onderon were rebuffed, and he was forced to seek help elsewhere, namely from two Naddist sympathizers he encountered while walking the streets of Iziz. The two men, [[Rask]] and [[Nebo]], escorted Kun to Freedon Nadd's tomb on Dxun, where he succeeded in penetrating the structure's nearly-impregnable walls with [[Exar Kun's lightsaber/Legends|his lightsaber]] to gain entry. He explored the crypt and, while doing so, disturbed the spirit of Freedon Nadd. The Dark Lord recognized Kun's insatiable lust for greater power and realized that in this man laid an opportunity to bring his ultimate goal of physical resurrection to fruition. Nadd instructed Exar Kun to reach into his sarcophagus and remove the [[Sith scroll/Legends|Sith scroll]] that was hidden beneath his corpse, and with it he told the Jedi to travel to [[Korriban]], the ancestral [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of the Sith.<ref name=\"DLOTS2\" />\n\nNadd's spirit next encountered Exar Kun just as he was being attacked by [[Korriban zombie|the guardian spirits]] of Korriban's [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|Valley of the Dark Lords]]. When the beleaguered Jedi implored Nadd for help, the spirit guided Kun to take refuge in a dilapidated [[Great Temple (Korriban)|Sith temple]]. This, however, was a ruse; Nadd trapped Kun inside by sealing off the entrance behind him and forcing him to go further into the temple. As they walked, the Dark Lord explained that the temple was steeped in the power of many long-dead Sith. Nadd brought him before [[Great crystal|a crystal obelisk]], which he explained was the final resting place for the tormented [[Soul/Legends|souls]] of Jedi Masters who had once stood in opposition of the Dark Lords and lost. When Kun inquired as to whether or not Nadd planned to release the trapped spirits from their [[Prison/Legends|imprisonment]], the Dark Lord reminded him that he was not a savior of Jedi, but rather their destroyer; he lent credence to his proclamation when he brought the roof down on Kun, crushing every [[Bone/Legends|bone]] in the Jedi's body.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> Kun then attempted to call his former Master, Vodo-Siosk Baas, through the Force for assistance, but Nadd intervened when he realized that the [[Krevaaki]] was trying to save his student. He lashed out with the power of the dark side at Baas and interrupted the link between him and Kun. Nadd now had the broken man exactly where he wanted him; he claimed that if Kun wanted to live, the only power able to save him was that of the dark side. Nadd rebuked Kun each time he refused to fully submit. Left with no other options, the fallen Jedi finally surrendered himself to the dark side and, through its power, was [[Force healing/Legends|healed]]. Nadd then took Kun as his Sith apprentice.<ref name=\"DLOTS3\" />\n\n=====The end of Freedon Nadd=====\n{{Quote|Beware of ''Exar Kun''! He has acquired great ''Sith powers''. He has betrayed me!

One in particular gave a detailed account of Nadd's own Sith Master, Naga Sadow, and his final residence on Yavin 4. Nadd revealed to Kun that the next phase of his enlightenment would take place there. Prior to their departure, Nadd stated that the lingering spirits of the deceased Dark Lords, with whom he had all the while been in communion, required an evaluation of Kun's newly-declared commitment to the dark side. He stood by as [[Tuk'ata/Legends|Tuk'ata hounds]]&mdash;[[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Sithspawn|abominations]] who prowled the halls of the temple and preyed upon intruders&mdash;attacked his apprentice. Nadd confiscated the Dark Jedi's lightsaber and demanded that Kun exercise his newfound power. Initially hesitant, Kun finally gave in to his [[Force rage|anger]] and slew all of the beasts. Freedon Nadd, as well as his fellow Sith spirits, was finally satisfied that his new student had embraced the Sith way, and declared that Exar Kun had become one with the dark side of the Force.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\n[[File:Nadd'sSecondDeath.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Freedon Nadd dies a second death.]]\nNadd next met his new student on Yavin 4, after Kun had been captured by the moon's resident Massassi warriors. Nadd followed them as they brought the Dark Jedi into Naga Sadow's temple, where Kun was prepared as a sacrifice to its guardian [[Sith wyrm]]. The specter demanded that his reluctant apprentice use the power that was now his to command, and Kun finally acquiesced; he used the Force [[Telekinesis/Legends|to seize]] a Sith amulet from the possession of [[Zythmnr|a Massassi priest]] that increased his power exponentially. Nadd stood by while Kun freed himself and obliterated the monstrosity and several Massassi, causing the remaining Sith to bow before him in supplication.<ref name=\"DLOTS4\" /> Nadd was thoroughly pleased, as he had finally found a being who had the necessary power to perform the alchemical processes required to create a physical body for him. Upon revealing his true intentions to Exar Kun, however, he was betrayed; the Dark Jedi had grown tired of Nadd's ever-looming presence and rejected to help him outright. He then tested the amulet's power by attacking the Sith spirit with [[Force blast|a blast of Force energy]]. When Nadd recoiled in pain from the assault, Kun unleashed a full-strength blast that fatally wounded the Dark Lord.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> In the throes of a second death, Nadd appeared one last time before Aleema and Satal Keto and warned them of the threat now posed by Exar Kun's tremendous power. He named them, along with Ulic Qel-Droma, as the inheritors to his Sith legacy, before fading into Chaos for a second and final time.<ref name=\"DLOTS4\" />\n\nEach of those with whom Freedon Nadd had become involved following his final defeat on Onderon went on to become influential galactic figures as they progressed further down the dark path and sought to perpetuate the ways of the Sith. The foremost among them was Exar Kun, who ascended to Dark Lord of the Sith<ref name=\"DLOTS6\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 6|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 6]]</ref> along with Ulic Qel-Droma.<ref name=\"EGTTF\" /> Kun then pooled his resources with those of Qel-Droma's and Aleema Keto's Krath cult and formed the infamous [[Brotherhood of the Sith|Sith Brotherhood]],<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> which went on to initiate the galaxy-spanning conflagration known as the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]].<ref name=\"TSW\">''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 The Sith War]]''</ref>\n\n====Dark Wars====\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n{{Quote|Freedon Nadd was a Dark Jedi.

The [[Onderon Civil War]] broke out that same year, and Nihilus's Sith allied themselves with a [[General/Legends|general]] named [[Vaklu]], the rival and cousin of Onderon's Queen [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]]&mdash;a direct descendant of Freedon Nadd. This union posed a threat to the united [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Neo-Crusaders]] of [[Canderous Ordo|Mandalore the Preserver]], whose base was near Nadd's tomb on Dxun. The Sith camp near the tomb was eventually discovered by the Mandalorians, who sent three companions of the [[Meetra Surik|Jedi Exile]] to investigate. They broke through the Sith defenses and killed a group of Dark Jedi and Sith Lords who were performing a ritual to control the beasts in Iziz, specifically one large [[drexl]] they had planned to use to break into Queen Talia's throne room.

Following the end of the [[New Sith Wars]] in [[1000 BBY]], Nadd's tomb was visited by [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]], the last living Dark Lord of the Sith in the galaxy. Bane unearthed Nadd's holocron on Dxun, which he studied in its entirety, only to discover that he himself was unable to comprehend the intricacies of Sith magic.

He was certain that he would be granted the rank of Jedi Knight, but when the Masters on Ossus refused to promote him, Nadd was shaken to the core of his being. His failure to understand the reasons behind the Masters' decision gave way to an anger that grew rapidly. When he sought answers from his own teacher, Matta Tremayne, he refused to accept her answer to his question: that the path to self-discovery was one that he had to travel alone.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" />\n\nNadd's descent to the dark side began with the slaying of Matta Tremayne, whom Nadd faulted for the emotional pain he felt due to not being chosen for Jedi Knighthood. In his own arrogance, Nadd refused to accept responsibility for his Master's death, instead believing that she had been the cause of her own demise. Nadd was consumed with anger and festering hatred following his fall to the dark side, and he soon afterward was interested only in exacting revenge on the entire Jedi Order. Nadd pursued his goal in earnest and amassed a wealth of dark side knowledge in his desire to become the most powerful Sith sorcerer who had ever lived.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" />\n\nAs he grew in power and understanding, Freedon Nadd came to believe that the Force existed only to serve him.<ref name=\"Invincible\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref> He felt that once an individual had embraced the dark side, the two were inseparable. Once he himself made the transition from a follower of the light to a Master of the Sith, he subscribed to the theory that he and his servants would eventually triumph over the Jedi through the dark side. He even claimed that the Jedi harbored a deep-seated fear of its power. He developed a craving for conquest<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> after he assumed the position of Dark Lord,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> and chose the planet of Onderon as his to rule. The planet's citizens were forced to worship him, and there was no tolerance for malcontents; those who refused to accept his authority were banished from Iziz and left to the mercy of the beasts of Onderon's wilderness.<ref name=\"BWOO2\" /> He also sired a bloodline through which he ensured the continued dominion over Onderon even after his death.<ref name=\"TOTJA\" />\n\nAs Dark Lord of the Sith, Freedon Nadd wore heavy [[battle armor]] and a [[Armor/Legends|helmet]] that also served as the crown with which he signified his kingship. The dark side's [[Poison/Legends|poisonous]] nature affected Nadd outwardly, leaving him with blanched and withered flesh under his protective coverings.<ref name=\"ROT\" /> When he finally passed into Chaos, Nadd refused to relinquish his ties with the physical realm. Although he was, by his own admission, powerless while in spirit form,<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> Nadd was still able to influence the world of the living through his Sith devotees. His spirit continued to direct the actions of the Onderonian people for his own purposes, and they submitted to the Dark Lord's demands for fealty without equivocation. He readily obliged those who appealed to him for wisdom and continued to strengthen them in dark side magic. He was particularly careful, however, not to bestow enough Sith wisdom upon his disciples so as to allow them to surpass him in power. The primary reason for Nadd sharing his knowledge was to find an individual whose skill would eventually reach the necessary level to create for Nadd a physical body through Sith alchemy, into which the Dark Lord could be resurrected and once again command the full scope of the dark side's power.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> He actively pushed King Ommin and Queen Amanoa to achieve their full potential through competition with one another, hoping that one of them would become powerful enough to bring his plan to reality. When he realized that neither Ommin nor Amanoa would ever achieve the level of ability that he required,<ref name=\"TOTJC\" /> Nadd abandoned them both to the mercy of the Jedi.<ref name=\"BWOO2\" /><ref name=\"FNU2\" /> Nadd was also given to frequent moments of sinister laughter when his schemes seemed to go according to his plans.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\n===Collector===\n{{Quote|Let me show you these wonderful amulets.

Even prior to beginning his Jedi training, Nadd displayed the capability to wield many of the powers the Jedi Masters themselves commanded, and more. His teachers believed such intuitiveness would surely see Nadd sit among them, far sooner than any student that preceded him. His skill with a lightsaber was just barely on par with that of his Master, Matta Tremayne, whom Nadd was still able to kill, though only after Tremayne refused to defend herself any longer. The murder of Master Tremayne combined with a lust for power led Freedon Nadd to the dark side, where he gained access to more violent and corrupting uses of the Force.<ref name=\"Powahh\">The ''[[Tales of the Jedi Companion]]'' says that Freedon Nadd knew every Force power included therein, as well as those still hidden in holocrons and other items of lore.</ref> The holocrons of King Adas<ref name=\"END\" /> and Darth Andeddu<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> comprised his initial knowledge base, and further study under Naga Sadow saw Nadd become a master of Sith sorcery.<ref name=\"FF904\" /> Sith magic was the means by which Nadd eliminated Sadow when the Dark Lord was no longer of any use to him,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> and was also the power Nadd called upon to assist him in the conquest of Onderon.<ref name=\"DSSB\" /> The Dark Lord recorded the totality of his knowledge within his own holocron, a device which would contribute to the tutelage of the Sith apprentice Darth Zannah some three thousand years later. Also within Nadd's holocron was his extensive knowledge regarding the [[orbalisk]] parasites of Dxun, [[Crustacean/Legends|crustaceans]] that fed on the power of the dark side of the Force.<ref name=\"ROT\" />\n\nDespite his sickly appearance, Nadd was still a force to be reckoned with. Countless Jedi fell in battle to [[Freedon Nadd's short lightsaber|his short bronze-bladed lightsaber]], and many more were destroyed with his [[Freedon Nadd's blaster|personal blaster]].<ref name=\"DSSB\" /> Nadd's very occupation of Onderon infected its atmosphere with the dark side so completely that the planet remained under its pall even after Nadd's physical death. Both his sarcophagus and tomb became focal points of dark side energy, and radiated so potently that Force-sensitives within close proximity were immediately affected; [[darksider]]s became empowered, while followers of the light felt stifled in the Force, as if being smothered by the dark side. When confronted by the power of Arca Jeth, Nadd's influence was unable to endure in the Jedi Master's presence, and was driven from Iziz&mdash;temporarily.<ref name=\"TOTJA\" />\n\nUnlike his [[Exar Kun/Legends|future apprentice]], when Nadd was confronted by the Massassi, he was powerful enough to fight and hold them off until he was deemed worthy of Naga Sadow's consideration. Nadd's spirit retained a measure of the power he had commanded in life and continued to exert influence over his descendants, who maintained dominion over Onderon in Nadd's name. The Dark Lord's spirit came and went as it pleased, even being able to move across the galaxy from from one celestial body to another.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> Nadd was gifted with foresight, evidenced by his predictions about the men that both Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma would become.<ref name=\"DLOTS2\" /> He was able to reach through the Force to attack adversaries with the dark side, an ability he used to prevent Vodo-Siosk Baas from interfering in the corruption of Exar Kun. Nadd was gifted with Force healing, an act in which he engaged to further convince Exar Kun of the dark side's superiority.<ref name=\"DLOTS3\" /> It was Exar Kun who put an end to Freedon Nadd's spirit once and for all, however, after he assaulted the Dark Lord with a blast of Force energy that Nadd was unable to withstand.<ref name=\"DLOTS4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFreedon Nadd was created by author [[Tom Veitch]] for the [[Tales of the Jedi 1|second issue]] of the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (miniseries)|first]] [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] story arc, [[1993]]'s [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi \u2014 Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon|''Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon'']]. The process of creating the ''Tales of the Jedi'' series was discussed in ''[[Making Star Wars Comics Come Alive]]'', an interview with Veitch, ''Tales of the Jedi'' artist [[Chris Gossett]], and editor [[Dan Thorsland]].

Nadd also appeared in both ''Tales of the Jedi'' audio adaptations, the [[Tales of the Jedi (audio)|first]] of which encompassed ''Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon'', as well as ''The Freedon Nadd Uprising''.
