Weeb|Mission to Lianna}}\n'''Jenna Lars''' was a short [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|woman]] who had a distinctive [[Liann]] appearance with black hair and olive skin. During the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] Jenna was a physically strong woman in her mid-forties and was overweight. She was quite a nervous character who drank heavily but this did not tend to affect her keen perceptive skills and suspicious nature.\n\nDuring the [[Rebellion era]] Jenna was on the run from the authorities. She had many professions during her time some of which were illegal and most were mysterious in nature. This meant that getting apprehended by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] or other local agencies was a bad idea. She subsequently worked for the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Darren T. Weeb]] where her activities were relatively straight.\n\nJenna was said to have a lot of information on [[Santhe/Sienar Technologies]] and this meant that she was far more afraid of [[Santhe Security]] than the Empire.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mission to Lianna]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lars, Jenna}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Lianns]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
