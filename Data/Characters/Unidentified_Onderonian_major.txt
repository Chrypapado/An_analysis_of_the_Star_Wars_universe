Under the supervision of this [[Major/Legends|major]], an investigation implicated a local [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]] named [[Dhagon Ghent]].\n\nAn exiled [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] named [[Meetra Surik]] required Ghent's assistance to set up a meeting with [[Kavar]], a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] hiding on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], so she investigated the murder far more deeply than the major had. She uncovered evidence and eyewitness accounts proving that Ghent could not have been the killer.\n\nSurik brought this new evidence to Captain [[Riiken]], who believed the information would be of great assistance. However, rather than concurring with his subordinate, the major reacted with skepticism and anger. Only after a great deal of persuasion did he agree to release Ghent due to the new evidence.\n\n==Equipment==\nThe major wore a standard blue Onderonian officer's [[Clothing/Legends|uniform]], including a white cape over the right shoulder. He also carried a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThis major was created for ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', a [[video game]] released in late [[2004]] by [[Obsidian Entertainment]], but was not given a name. He used the same 3-D head model as the character [[Rukil]] and [[Ahlan Matale]] from the previous game in the series, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', released the [[2003|previous year]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Majors]]\n[[Category:Onderon military personnel]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified military personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
