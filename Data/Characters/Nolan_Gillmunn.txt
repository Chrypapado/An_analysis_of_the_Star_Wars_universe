When the Empire became aware of the Rebels' presence, they attacked in an attempt to capture Skywalker. Gillmunn took a team and left to help Skywalker escape, but eventually they were ambushed and captured by Imperials. Just as the Imperial captain gave the word for the Jabiimi squad's execution, they were interrupted by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] orbital bombardment. Soon after, [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] arrived in his [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] to finish off the remains of the Imperials. Skywalker left with the Rebels, but Gillmunn and his team stayed.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire: In the Shadows of Their Fathers]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Rebellion 0|''Rebellion'' 0]] {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Nolan Gillmunn\n|nl=Nolan Gillmunn\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gillmunn, Nolan}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jabiimi]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
