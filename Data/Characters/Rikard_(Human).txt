Rikard spent his youth on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], exploring the seedier districts of the world's [[Coruscant underworld|undercity]] with his brother [[Matwe]], and he later entered the service of the [[Pyke Syndicate/Legends|Pyke Syndicate]] as a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]]. After Rikard failed to complete an assignment for the Pykes, the cartel demanded that he compensate them for their losses, resulting in Rikard being forced to continue serving the Pykes for the foreseeable future until he could pay off his debt.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Under a Black Sun]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pyke Syndicate members]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
