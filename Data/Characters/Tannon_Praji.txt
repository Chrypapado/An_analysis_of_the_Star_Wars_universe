These new ventures may make it altogether impossible, but I guess that's Coruscant's intent, isn't it?|[[Bronwynn Koft]], on measures which Tannon Praji helped institute|url=http://www.holonetnews.com/51/news/13411_1.html}}\n'''Tannon Praji''', a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], was the [[First Minister (Coruscant Ministry of Ingress)|First Minister]] of the [[Coruscant Ministry of Ingress/Legends|Coruscant Ministry of Ingress]] during the final [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. [[Reproduction/Legends|Born]] in [[60 BBY/Legends|60 BBY]] to the wealthy [[House Praji/Legends|House Praji]], he developed a love of art at an early age, built his own private fortune, [[Marriage/Legends|married]] a woman named [[Maree Praji|Maree]], and sired a [[Onnelly Praji|daughter]]. He ascended to the position of First Minister at a difficult [[Time/Legends|time]]; responsible for overseeing immigrants and emigrants to and from [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], Praji's directives began to clash with those of the Republic, and so he had to invalidate his organization's core ideals for the sake of Republic security. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], he closed the borders of Coruscant to all but those known to be loyal to the Republic. Later, he called for the deportation of all those hailing from [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederate]] [[Planet/Legends|worlds]].\n\nPraji received much criticism for his hardliner policies; was labeled as a rich, uncaring maniac; and became the subject of several [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] attempts. In reality, he resented the decisions he had to make, but he was under a great deal of pressure from other governmental factions. In order to relieve his stress, Praji spent a great deal of time at the [[Galaxies Opera House/Legends|Galaxies Opera House]], where he would commune with [[Politics/Legends|political]] entities and industry tycoons. He enlisted the help of a [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]], [[Ottegru Grey]], who secretly drew funds from Praji and donated them to the Republic's [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. This wound up working to Praji's advantage, however, as he crept into favor with Palpatine, who would soon ascend to the position of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]]. Under Palpatine's [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], Praji worked as a [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucrat]] in an organization that was now a puppet of Coruscant's military [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and ascension===\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Tannon Praji was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] in [[60 BBY/Legends|60 BBY]] to the influential [[House Praji/Legends|House Praji]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He had two siblings: [[Griff Praji|Griff]] and [[Tannon Praji's brother|another brother]]. Praji's [[Tannon Praji's mother|mother]] wanted to instill in her sons an appreciation for fine arts and culture, but did not want to limit them to what the capital had to offer. As a result, the family took repeated vacations offworld to such places as the [[Museum/Legends|museums]] of [[Porus Vida]], and the [[Sharu/Legends|Sharu]] ruins of the [[Rafa system/Legends|Rafa system]]. The trips had a great effect on Praji, and he grew to be an armchair aesthete. Eventually, he [[Marriage/Legends|married]] a woman named [[Maree Praji|Maree]], and sired a daughter, [[Onnelly Praji|Onnelly]]. Griff also had a child, a boy named [[Nahdonnis Praji|Nahdonnis]].<ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\nThrough his inheritance, Praji was able to build a private fortune for himself separate from the coffers of House Praji, although he continued his family's long-standing investment in the [[Bank of the Core/Legends|Bank of the Core]].<ref name=\"ttsp\" /> The investment bought him a variety of friends and assets in high places.<ref name=\"db2\">{{DB|character|ottegrugrey|Grey, Ottegru|archivedate=20101116014529}}</ref> Praji himself, however, had nothing to do with the Bank's [[Standard day/Legends|day]] to day operations. When [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] came to power in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], one of the first appointments in his administration was Praji's ascension to the position of [[Second Minister/Legends|Second Minister]] of the [[Coruscant Ministry of Ingress/Legends|Coruscant Ministry of Ingress]], under [[First Minister (Coruscant Ministry of Ingress)|First Minister]] [[Zelebitha Effhod]].<ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\nAt first, the [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucratic]] job was uneventful, and Praji was able to carry out his work with a minimum of fuss, until the advent of the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]].<ref name=\"ttsp\" /> Paranoia struck [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] as the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] teetered toward warfare.<ref name=\"db\" /> Billions of immigrants wanted to get into Coruscant, but Praji felt that the Ministry's obligation to provide unlimited opportunity to offworlders and foreigners would clash with the well-being of the Republic, as he saw the influx of immigrants as a threat to Coruscant's security. As a result, Praji reorganized the Ministry's operations to better operate under the extraordinary circumstances.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nHe was able to convince Effhod to close Coruscant's borders to the immigrants indefinitely. In turn, the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceports]] were overburdened, and [[Transport/Legends|transports]] were forced to wait for clearance that they would not get. The immigrants that did get through the cordons found themselves exploited in roles such as that of a menial servant. Those suspected of [[Treason/Legends|treason]] by the government could and would be deported. That caused a great amount of dissent, and in a knee-jerk reaction, movements such as the [[Refugee Relief Movement/Legends|Refugee Relief Movement]] decried Praji and his actions, labeling him as a distant, cold trillionaire who cared little for the plight of those in need. The accusations stung Praji, who found his own position morally taxing.<ref name=\"db\" /> In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Effhod [[Death/Legends|succumbed]] to [[Quannot's Syndrome]], and Praji succeeded as First Minister of the Coruscant Ministry of Ingress.<ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\n===Clone Wars===\nThe day after, the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|Battle of Geonosis]] took place, and the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] broke out. Praji considered the greatest tragedy of the conflict to be the destruction of the [[Museum of Light]] on [[Tandis Four]], which had been spearheaded by Confederate [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] to demoralize [[Loyalist/Legends|Loyalists]] in the area. Dooku was a member of the aristocracy of [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno]], as several members of House Praji had been in the past, and so Praji himself was appalled to see a distant relative commit such acts. He publicly decried Dooku for his actions, but Praji's words had no effect whatsoever, nor did they reduce the image of him created by the Refugee Relief Movement as an uncaring elitist.<ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\nIn short order, the [[Commission for the Protection of the Republic/Legends|Commission for the Protection of the Republic]] was formed in order to secure the survival of the Republic in testing times. The committee, however, would bully government officials into leaning their way, and Praji was no exception. COMPOR forced Praji to deport those whose [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworlds]] had sided with the Confederacy,<ref name=\"db\" /> such as the [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] and the [[Gossam/Legends|Gossam]]. The goal was never fully enforceable,<ref name=\"ttsp\" /> but Praji's efforts were enough to make an impact, the results of which for the First Minister were twofold. Chancellor Palpatine praised Praji's efforts and movements, claiming that they were instrumental in securing peace and security on the capital. However, many of Praji's critics were pushed to extreme measures, and several [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] and kidnapping attempts were made on the First Minister by both dissidents and agents of the Confederacy.<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\n[[File:Opera_box.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Praji and company in Romeo Treblanc's box at the Galaxies Opera House]]\nFollowing one particular attempt by Aqualish Separatists, Praji was offered the protection services of [[Ottegru Grey]] by the Bank of the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]], at a nominal fee.<ref name=\"ttsp\" /> Grey was a family friend, and Praji accepted. Grey served as Praji's [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]], assistant and,<ref name=\"db2\" /> more covertly, as his [[Accountant/Legends|accountant]],<ref name=\"ttsp\" /> although in reality he was acting as an [[Agent/Legends|agent]] for the Bank of the Core. He secretly siphoned funds from Praji's coffers and leaked them into Palpatine's war chest, which allowed Palpatine to pay off the debts of [[Romeo Treblanc]], owner of the [[Galaxies Opera House/Legends|Galaxies Opera House]]. Grey's actions secured both him and Praji a lifetime pass to the Galaxies Opera House, which Praji frequented whenever his work schedule allowed.<ref name=\"db2\" />\n\nGrey did continue to serve faithfully as a bodyguard however, foiling an attempt by Confederate-backed [[Zarracine]] [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorists]] to board Praji's [[Limousine|repulsorlimo]].<ref name=\"ttsp\" /> Praji thoroughly enjoyed the opera and ballet, and he had the added advantage of access to Treblanc's [[Romeo Treblanc's private viewing box|private box]].<ref name=\"db2\" /> There, he would meet with lofty industrialists such as [[Onara Kuat]], whom he introduced to Ottegru Grey.<ref name=\"db3\">{{DB|character|onarakuat|Kuat, Onara|archivedate=20100209160513}}</ref> Praji was present in the box<ref name=\"rots\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> during a performance of the opera [[Squid Lake/Legends|''Squid Lake'']]. Several days later, Palpatine declared himself [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] and [[Declaration of a New Order|transformed]] the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"rots\" /> In the wake of [[Imperialization/Legends|Imperialization]], the Ministry of Ingress was made into nothing more than a puppet of the Coruscant&mdash;Imperial Center&mdash;military [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police]].<ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\nDespite his reservations, Praji secured a position for himself in Palpatine's [[New Order/Legends|New Order]], and took leave to relocate Maree and Onnelly to \"[[Byss/Legends|Emerald Splendor]],\" which was apparently a hidden paradise located in the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]]. In reality, the world was Palpatine's own private retreat, where he would go to drain [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] energy out of immigrants like Praji's wife and daughter to sustain himself. Praji's life on Coruscant, however, continued without incident, and his nephew Nahdonnis eventually came to serve in the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]].<ref name=\"ttsp\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Look after the credits and the billions will look after themselves.|Ralltiiri aphorism, Praji's favorite saying|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji}}\nPraji, though rich and privileged, did not seek to oppress the poor and disadvantaged as his detractors asserted during the Separatist crisis. In fact, he lamented his choices, despite finding himself in a situation in which neither of the two possible courses of action were particularly attractive.<ref name=\"db\" /> However, Praji's favorite saying was a [[Ralltiiri]] aphorism about looking after [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].
