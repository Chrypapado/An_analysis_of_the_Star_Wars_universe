Collus firmly believed that knowledge had to be applied in order to be meaningful, and that direct experience was more important than what was learned from [[Book/Legends|textbooks]] and data disks.\n\nAfter his [[Death/Legends|passing]], Collus became a celebrated hero of the [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaanian]] people. Many institutions were named after him, and University students formed the organization [[Students of Collus]], which became a vanguard of many [[Politics/Legends|political]] movements in Aldera.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Illustrated Star Wars Universe]]'' {{1stm}}\n*{{FFCite|18|ALD4, ''Alderaan''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Collus\n|es=Collus\n|nl=Collus\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Educators]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Philosophers]]"}}}]}}}}
