He met [[Klis Joo]] while working on a ship for some [[Duros/Legends|Duros]]. When Joo became the [[Governor/Legends|governor]] of a [[City/Legends|city]], she invited him to come to [[Almas]] to work for her. One of the first things he did for her was upgrade [[Forard]]'s [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] from a four-ship center to a twenty-ship one.\n\nBran was often willing to do favors for people, but would call in favors in return. He had many contacts with smugglers and [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]], and still sometimes worked on smuggling vessels on the side while working at Forard. [[Nirama]] tried a couple of times to lure Isken to work for his [[organization]], but Isken enjoyed his work and knew it was safer working on Almas.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBran was considered a friendly man, but sometimes suspicious. He was tall and rakish looking, with [[Color/Legends|dark hair]] and a patchy beard. As he got on in [[Standard year/Legends|years]], he dyed his hair to look younger. He had an obvious [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] [[Eye/Legends|eye]] and usually dressed in overalls.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Isken, Bran}}\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]"}}}]}}}}
