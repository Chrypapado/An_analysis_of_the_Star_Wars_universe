A few years before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] visited her to acquire a replacement [[fulstar plate]] for the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]. She almost hit Solo with a [[Hydrospanner/Legends|hydrospanner]] because he startled her by arriving at her establishment immediately after [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] shoplifters rummaged through it, before recognizing him as a friend. When she complained to Solo about his failure to stop any of the Jawas, the smuggler sarcastically asked if she expected him to shoot them. Solo then purchased a refurbished fulstar plate from Kromer, insisting on a red square plate for his [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]], and \"not an old pentagonal unit,\" but Kromer protested that she already knew what he needed. In addition to the fulstar plate, Solo left with a bag of several [[Wookiee-ookiee]]s from a batch Kromer said she was baking for [[Chalmun/Legends|Chalmun]]. Back at the ''Falcon'', Solo and Chewbacca discovered a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] hidden in the bag, containing a [[Hologram/Legends|holographic]] message from Kromer warning them that [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] customs officer [[Rench]] placed a transmitter inside the fulstar plate she sold them. Solo decided to place the transmitter, along with a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing beacon]] Chewbacca found, in an escape pod, which he used to lure Captain Rench's pursuing corvette into a black hole.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[Ryder Windham]] created Kromer in tribute to ''Star Wars'' fan [[Kayla Kromer]], known in fandom for her selfmade ''Millennium Falcon'' bed.<ref name=\"TBS appendix\">{{Cite_web|url=http://timelineuniverse.net/AdventuresinHyperspace.htm#R14|title=The Big Switch|author=Ryder Windham|date=2015-04-22|work=timelineuniverse.net|publisher=Unpublished Scholastic book|nobackup=1}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Adventures in Hyperspace: The Big Switch]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
