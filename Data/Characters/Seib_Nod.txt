A lifelong member, she grew bored of her cloistered lifestyle and opted for a life of crime instead. Stealing valuable artifacts from her temple, she fled Lorrd and went to the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] world of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], where she intended to sell the stolen items. She found a buyer in [[Archaeology/Legends|archaeologist]] [[Artuo Pratuhr]].\n\nPratuhr and his assistant, [[Zey Nep]], met with Nod at the [[Outlander Club/Legends|Outlander Club]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]. The archaeologist was initially wary of Nod's intentions, but the Lorrdian was able to convince him that she was acting on behalf of the Sisterhood in selling the items. Once he had handed over his money, she decided to double-cross him and left with both the items and the [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. She was later apprehended by Pratuhr and Nep, and was given a long sentence in [[CoCo Penitentiary]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Near-Human]] [[Lorrdian/Legends|Lorrdian]] from [[Lorrd/Legends|Lorrd]], Seib Nod was a lifelong member of the [[Sisterhood of the Beatific Countenance]]. As such, she was forced to live in a cloistered fashion, which soon bored her. With no funds whatsoever, she realized that in order to start a new life for herself, she would have to procure them from somewhere. Not caring how she went about it, Nod stole several valuable artifacts from her temple, and departed Lorrd post haste, for the galactic capital of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. There, she continued to wear her religious fatigues to mask her criminal intentions.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nIntending to pawn the stolen relics, she was contacted by [[Artuo Pratuhr]], an archeologist who wanted to buy them for the [[Galactic Museum]]. Nod met with Pratuhr and his assistant, [[Zey Nep]], at the [[Uscru Entertainment District/Legends|Uscru Entertainment District's]] [[Outlander Club/Legends|Outlander Club]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], at the height of the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]].<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"Oakie Dokes DB\">{{DB|character|oakiedokes|Dokes, Oakie|archivedate=20100611105135}}</ref><ref name=\"aotc\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Initially, the archeologist was suspicious of Nod's intentions, but she claimed that the Sisterhood was selling the items to raise desperately needed funds. The clandestine nature of the sale was to conceal the fact that the Sisterhood was in such financial trouble that it needed to sell the relics in the first place.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nPratuhr agreed to the deal, but the criminal atmosphere of [[Galactic City]] caused Nod to make a snap judgment&mdash;drawing a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] on the archeologist, she took his money, and fled the Outlander Club for an outbound flight.<ref name=\"db\" /> A few days later,<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|386|Nod, Seib}}</ref> while waiting at the dock, Nod was confronted by Pratuhr, who caught up to her. She did not feel threatened, however&mdash;she was armed, he was not. What Nod had not accounted for was the presence of Nep, who, standing behind her and disguised as a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]], had her own blaster trained on her. Realizing that her plans were thwarted, she returned the money. Pratuhr then took her to the local authorities, and returned the relics to the Sisterhood. Nod was then incarcerated in [[CoCo Penitentiary]] for a considerable amount of time, during which she was pardoned by the Sisterhood for her crimes.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAlthough the Sisterhood of Beatific Countenance required lifelong servitude, Seib Nod did not find her servitude spiritually fulfilling in the slightest, and so, due to her boredom, sought out more material possessions. She was desperate enough to break free of her situation by turning to crime as a way of raising money for herself. Once she had committed one criminal act, she was prone to lying to others, and she found herself so changed by her one act that she felt free to perform another. When she was jailed, she was at such a point that the forgiveness of her fellow Sisters meant nothing to her. Nod had light skin. As with all members of the Sisterhood, Nod had scripture tatooed on her body,<ref name=\"db\" /> including distinctive facial patterns.<ref name=\"db\" /> While traditionally members of the Sisterhood wore their robes and masks outside their temple to hide their skin, Nod maintained her religious garb in order to hide her [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] nature.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Seib Nod first appeared, unnamed, in the [[2002]] film by [[George Lucas]], [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']], during the Outlander Club scene. In [[2004]], the character was given the name \"Seib Nod\" in the article \"[[Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night]],\" which was published in [[Star Wars Insider 75|''Star Wars Insider'' 75]], and written by [[Daniel Wallace]]. Spelled backwards, Seib Nod is [[Don Bies]], a special effects artist for ''Attack of the Clones.''<ref name=\"aotc\" />\n\nIn [[Trisha Biggar]]'s ''[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]'', published in [[2005]], the same character was identified as \"'''Seib Nob'''.\" Further complicating matters was [[Stephen J. Sansweet]] and [[Pablo Hidalgo]]'s ''[[Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels]]'', published twenty-six days after Biggar's book. ''Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels'' identified the character as \"'''Nob Seib''',\" leading \"[[What's The Story?]]\" author [[Tim Veekhoven]], the following year, to ask continuity editor [[Leland Chee]] as to what the true spelling was. Chee identified it as \"Seib Nod,\" the original designation given by Wallace.<ref>{{SWBoards|url=thread.jspa%3fthreadID=158725|thread=Spelling Discrepancies|user=[[Leland Chee|Leland Y Chee]]|date=December 27, 2006|time=6:13 AM|archiveurl=http://www.tm-travolta.net/archives/forums.sw.com/thread.jspa%3fthreadID=158725&start=0.html}}</ref>\n\nThe character's story was later fleshed out by [[Benjamin Christopher Norton Dawe]], writing as \"Captain Yossarian,\" through [[StarWars.com]]'s [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature, \"What's the Story?\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]'' {{C|as Seib Nob}}\n*''[[Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels]]'' {{C|as Nob Seib}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|seibnod|Nod, Seib|archivedate=20110410123215}}\n*{{InsiderCite|136|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: A Night at the Outlander Club}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Seib Nod\n|nl=Seib Nod\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nod, Seib}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Lorrdians]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
