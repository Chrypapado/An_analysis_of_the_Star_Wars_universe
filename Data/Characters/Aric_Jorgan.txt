I won't fight for a political agenda.|Aric Jorgan|Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire}}\n'''Aric Jorgan''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] who fought in the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], the [[Galactic War]] and the [[war against Zakuul]]. Born on [[Rendili/Legends|Rendili]], Jorgan enlisted in [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]] and joined an elite sniper squad called the [[Deadeyes]], eventually becoming its commanding officer. Accepting a promotion to [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]], Jorgan got transfered to [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] and fought in the [[Separatist War]] until he was blamed for the defection of Havoc Squad to the Empire and demoted to sergeant. General [[Vander]] assigned Jorgan and the last loyal Havoc Squad member to reform the squad, after the which the [[Republic Special Forces Division]] General [[Elin Garza]] ordered Jorgan and his new CO to hunt down the former Havoc commander [[Harron Tavus]] and his followers. The new Havoc foiled the traitors' operations on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], eventually neutralizing Tavus himself. Afterwards, Havoc Squad led a mission to destroy the new Imperial superweapon called the [[Gauntlet (Sith Empire)|''Gauntlet'']] and fought in the [[Battle of Corellia]], where the Squad reclaimed the [[Bastion (Corellia)|Bastion]] and captured General [[Arkos Rakton]], for which Jorgan and every other Havoc members received a [[Gold Crescent]].\n\nDuring his service in Havoc, Jorgan learned that his former unit, the Deadeyes, had been captured by the Empire and shipped to slave labor camps across the galaxy. He relentlessly pursued their tracks despite the interference from [[Republic Strategic Information Service]] agent [[Zane (SIS)|Zane]]. Eventually locating the last of his former squadmates on [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] only after two of them had already died from cold, Jorgan learned that Zane intentionally planted hundreds of Republic soldiers into Imperial POW camps, hoping that one of them would eventually lead to the mythical station [[Dusk 9]]. In [[3636 BBY]] the galaxy was attacked by the [[Eternal Empire]] of [[Zakuul]] and early in the [[Eternal Empire conquest]], Havoc Squad's commander went missing. Havoc members drifted their own ways, and with only Jorgan remaining in active military service, he was promoted to the rank [[Major/Legends|Major]] and given full command of a new Havoc Squad. Becoming disillusioned with the way Republic was run by [[Leontyne Saresh]] and its inaction in opposing the [[Eternal Throne]], Jorgan took Havoc Squad on an unsanctioned mission to Zakuul. There, Jorgan allied with [[Alliance Commander|the Alliance Commander]] to plant a wiretap on a [[Knights of Zakuul]] listening outpost. Later, Jorgan assisted the Alliance again on a mission to take control or disable the [[GEMINI]] frequency at the [[Hyperwave relay station]] located below the Zakuul [[Spire (Zakuul)|Spire]]. The mission was a near-total failure, with four of six Havoc Squad members dead, though the team did manage to retrieve a data archive on the GEMINI droids. In the aftermath, Jorgan fully committed to the Alliance cause, continuing the fight against Eternal Empire oppression during the [[Assault on the Gravestone]] and the [[Assault on Odessen]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early service===\n{{Quote|I'll make this completely clear, rookie\u2014when you're in the field, what I say goes. Period.|Aric Jorgan, to [[Meteor (Havoc Squad)|Havoc Squad's sergeant]]|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[File:Jorgan-combat.jpg|thumb|left|Jorgan fighting on Ord Mantell]]\nBorn on [[Rendili/Legends|Rendili]], Aric Jorgan enlisted in the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]] in part to defend his people, as the [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] had suffered a near-extinction by [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] in the [[Battle of Cathar]] [[3973 BBY|three hundred years]] before he [[3673 BBY|was born]]. Trained to become a [[Sniper/Legends|sniper]], Jorgan joined an elite squad of [[Deadeyes]] under Commander [[Vorne]], whom Jorgan had a great respect for. The squad consisted of elite marksmen who performed \"decapitation strikes,\" in which the Deadeye snipers would eliminate the officers of enemy units before [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] attacks in order to leave the opposition leaderless and disorganized. On occasion, the Deadeyes would wait outside an enemy base for weeks while waiting for a clear shot. Jorgan claimed over a dozen confirmed kills with this unit, eventually assuming command. When offered a port in the [[Ord Mantell Infantry Command]], Jorgan accepted, leaving command of the Deadeyes to his former executive officer [[Torve]].<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n[[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]] was a smart career move for Jorgan and came with a a promotion to [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]], though he had no interest in fighting the [[Mantellian Separatist Movement]]. Among Jorgan's subordinates on Ord Mantell was [[Felix Iresso]], with whom Jorgan would often clash on policy. In [[3643 BBY]], a shuttle carrying a powerful [[ZR-57 orbital strike bomb]] was shot down by the Separatists, who stole the bomb, capable of destroying the entire island of [[Avilatan]]. [[Republic Special Forces Division]] unit [[Havoc Squad]] led by [[Harron Tavus]] was dispatched to retrieve the bomb, with Jorgan providing assistance.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nTavus introduced Aric Jorgan to a [[Meteor (Havoc Squad)|Sergeant]] who was the Squad's newest recruit, and assigned Jorgan to oversee the Sergeant's progress in the mission and provide intel when necessary. Jorgan made it clear to the rookiee that he was in charge and his orders were to be followed without question. When a simple [[mission to Talloran Village]] resulted in the informant named [[Bellis]] found dead, the [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] tasked the Sergeant to find and acquire Bellis' field box, which would contain the info that the spy was trying to reveal before his death.<ref name=\"Clean Up Talloran\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper Bonus|Clean Up Talloran|Ord Mantell}}</ref>\n\nThe Sergeant returned the field box to Jorgan, who went to decode the information that was recovered, eventually revealing the bomb's location in the Separatist outpost on the island of [[Mannett Point]], where he also ordered the Sergeant to execute Separatists leaders [[Saphrro]], [[Vyru]], and [[Bol (Separatist)|Bol]].<ref name=\"Mannett Point\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper|Mannett Point|Ord Mantell}}</ref> Though the bomb was by then moved, it was tracked down to the [[Separatist stronghold]], where Commander Tavus took Havoc Squad while ordering Jorgan to keep the Sergeant out of it. Jorgan was then informed by a [[Unidentified technician (Ord Mantell)|technician]] that all communications with Havoc Squad had been lost and decided to nevertheless send the Sergeant to follow his squad and aid in locating the ZR-57, disregarding Tavus' command. The Sergeant was able to locate and disable the bomb, but learned that the rest of Havoc Squad decided to defect to the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]].<ref name=\"The Separatists' Stronghold\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper|The Separatists' Stronghold|Ord Mantell}}</ref> Back at [[Fort Garnik]], Command had chosen to blame Jorgan as a scapegoat for the defection, demoting him to sergeant and placing him under the newly promoted Lieutenant of Havoc Squad, its last remaining loyal member.<ref name=\"|New Assignment\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper|New Assignment|Ord Mantell}}</ref> Though [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vander]] later offered to reinstate his post on Ord Mantell with a full promotion, Jorgan declined, realizing he could make a bigger difference in the war as a member of an elite Special Forces unit such as Havoc Squad.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n===Service in Havoc Squad===\n{{GameLSmechanics|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n{{Quote|Command put me in Havoc to help you find Tavus and I intend to do just that.|Aric Jorgan|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[File:Havoc_Squad.png|thumb|right|250px|Jorgan and other Havoc members prepare for the assault on the Bastion]]\nJorgan and his new CO traveled to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to report to the head of the [[Republic Special Forces Division]], [[General/Legends|General]] [[Elin Garza]]<ref name=\"The Coruscant Assignment\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper|The Coruscant Assignment|Carrick Station}}</ref>. Garza ordered them to hunt down Havoc defectors, beginning with [[Jek Kardan]]. Though Jorgan was all for going out to hunt down Tavus and his followers, Garza stressed that they must first take out the traitors' underworld contacts on Coruscant. Garza first sent the Lieutenant and Jorgan to the [[Old Galactic Market]], putting them in contact with one of her men, [[Corporal/Legends|Corporal]] [[Garrum]]. The corporal told them that their first target was a cyborg named [[Krel]]. The cyborg had been capturing civilians and apparently implanting them with their illegal cybernetics. Fighting through Krel's army of war droids, the Lieutenant and Jorgan found criminal cyborg in his facility. Forced to kill Krel, the Lieutenant was then ordered by Garza to kill all the enhanced civilians within the facility. Jorgan noted that it didn't feel right, and that they didn't know whether the civilians really were enhanced or not. Ultimately, the Lieutenant agreed with Jorgan and let the civilians go.<ref name=\"Destroying the War Droids\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper|Destroying the War Droids|Coruscant}}</ref> Continuing on with the mission, the Lieutenant and Jorgan were sent to [[Justicars' Brigade|Justicar]] territory to find and capture Jek Kardan alive. Kardan tried to escape by pitting the present Imperial forces against the new squad.<ref name=\"More Old Friends\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper|More Old Friends|Coruscant}}</ref> Jorgan and his Lieutenant eventually tracked Kardan down in [[Sector 943|The Works]],<ref name=\"Assault on the Works\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper|Assault on the Works|Coruscant}}</ref> where he was guarding a transmitter responsible for the defectors' communications. The two managed to destroy the transmitter and after a lengthy conversation about the situation, the lieutenant convinced Kardan to help bring in his comrades.<ref name=\"Clearing Airwave\">{{TORcite|type=class|Trooper Bonus|Clearing Airwaves|Coruscant}}</ref>\n\nAfter Coruscant, the new Havoc Squad was assigned to hunt down Tavus' followers across the galaxy, picking them off one by one. They rescued Senator [[Zorin Krasul]] from [[Zora|Wraith]] on [[Port Raga]], stopped [[Ryler Dorant|Needles]]' experiments with the [[rakghoul]]s on [[Taris/Legends|Taris]], rescued [[Vanto Bazren|Fuse]] who came to regret his defection from Colonel [[Gorik]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], and destroyed [[Bex Kolos|Gearbox]]' prototype walker [[Project B]] with him still inside on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. Along the way, they were joined by new Havoc recruits Sergeant [[Elara Dorne]] and a prototype war droid [[M1-4X]], recovered from Captain [[Andrik]] on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Eventually, the new Havoc Squad confronted and defeated Tavus himself on his flagship, the [[Justice (Harrower-class)|''Justice'']].<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nFollowing the hunt for Tavus and his defectors, the new Havoc Squad was assigned to neutralize the new Imperial superweapon called the [[Gauntlet (Sith Empire)|''Gauntlet'']]. To fill the gaps in its roster, the squad recruited technical specialist [[Yuun (Gand)|Yuun]] and an explosive expert [[Tanno Vik]], before infiltrating the weapon during the [[Battle of the Gauntlet]] and destroying it with the help of the [[Safecrackers]] unit. With the [[Galactic War]] renewed, Havoc Squad was assigned to apprehend Imperial General [[Arkos Rakton]]. After rescuing the [[Dagger Wing]] from [[Belsavis prison]] and freeing the [[Eighty-first Infantry]] from their assignment on [[Voss]], Havoc Squad joined the Republic forces in the ongoing [[Battle of Corellia]]. There, Havoc Squad led the offensive to reclaim the [[Bastion (Corellia)|Bastion]] from the Empire alongside the Safecrackers and the [[Fifty-third Armored Platoon]]. Breaching the Bastion's defenses, Havoc Squad cornered General Rakton inside and successfully apprehended him, dealing a serious blow to the Imperial offensive. For capturing Rakton, Jorgan and other Havoc squad members each received a [[Gold Crescent]].<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n===Search for the Deadeyes===\n{{Quote|How many other soldiers have died for you, huh? A hundred? A thousand?|Jorgan threatens to kill Zane|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[File:Aric_Jorgan_1.png|thumb|left|240px|Aric Jorgan]]\nDuring his tenure with Havoc, Jorgan was informed by Republic Command that the Deadeyes, his former unit, had been captured on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Jorgan and his CO contacted [[Republic Strategic Information Service]] Agent [[Jonas Balkar]], who had previously assisted Havoc in retrieving M1-4X, for information on the Deadeyes' whereabouts. Storming an [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Imperial]]-controlled sector, Jorgan discovered that the Deadeyes had been shipped off to offworld camps as menial labor. He attempted to bring the data to Balkar for decryption, but walked in at a bad time, as Balkar was being hassled by Senior SIS Agent [[Zane (SIS)|Zane]]. Guessing by Havoc Squad's appearance that they were responsible for the recent attack on the Imperial camp, Zane warned them against future interference, proclaiming his desire to get the Deadeyes back by peaceful means. As soon as Zane left, Balkar said that he couldn't help Havoc with Zane watching him, so he directed Jorgan to his contact [[Gav]] in [[Signal Intelligence]] who could decrypt the coordinates.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nInstead of a response from Gav, Jorgan received an abrupt holocall from Zane, who once again warned him to stay out of his operation, which only made Jorgan more suspicious about Zane's interest in the Deadeyes. Left with three choices: ask Jonas Balkar or [[General/Legends|General]] [[Elin Garza|Garza]] for aid or decrypt the coordinates himself, Jorgan eventually decrypted part of the coordinates. Traveling to their location on Tatooine with his CO, Jorgan was able to locate and rescue [[Torve]], [[Synon]] and [[Miev]]. When Jorgan asked Torve how he got captured, the man realized that Jorgan knew nothing of their mission. Initially Torve refused to say anything, but relented when reminded that he required rescuing and explained that the Deadeyes were implanted with trackers and intentionally allowed themselves to be captured to scout the Imperial penal system. The plan was for the Imperials to take them to their territory so the SIS could rescue them and their comrades. However, they never anticipated that they would be split up and had been awaiting SIS extraction. Jorgan then called for a proper extraction for the captives, after which he got a holocall from Zane, who advised Havoc against further interference in his mission, but still wouldn't disclose what it was. Frustrated, Jorgan asked his CO for permission to cut Zane off, which was granted.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nDecrypting the rest of the coordinates, Jorgan and his CO traveled to an Imperial prison camp on [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], where they were surprised to find Zane himself among the prisoners [[Berix]] and [[Hal (sniper)|Hal]]. Zane admitted that he had been intentionally letting hundreds of Republic soldiers to be captured in the vain of hope that one of them would be taken to the rumored Imperial prison and black-ops research station, [[Dusk 9]], which Jorgan dismissed as a myth. However, the Imperials didn't consider their captives of enough interest, so Zane bugged himself and allowed himself to be captured, figuring that the brass at Dusk 9 couldn't resist an SIS agent. When Jorgan found out that [[Koplin]] and [[Trace (Deadeyes)|Trace]], two of his former comrades, had died from the cold, he became enraged. Drawing a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] on Zane, he accused him of making false promises to his former squad and demanded to know how many other soldiers had died for his fool's errand. Zane smugly pointed out that Jorgan couldn't kill him with witnesses around, but the surviving the Deadeyes stated that they would just say that the Imperials killed him. Growing terrified, Zane turned to the Havoc CO, who ordered Jorgan to stand down, promising that Zane would answer for what he had done, the right way. Jorgan then relented and Zane subsequently told him that he would see him imprisoned for attempting to murder him. Jorgan then called for a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] for his remaining men.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n===Leading Havoc Squad===\n{{Quote|Never thought I'd miss bureaucrats butting into military matters, but what we gained in efficiency we lost in soul.|Aric Jorgan|Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire}}\n[[File:Jorgan_sniper.png|thumb|right|240px|Jorgan on a mission to Zakuul]]\nIn [[3636 BBY]] the galaxy was attacked by the [[Eternal Empire]] of [[Zakuul]] and early in the [[Eternal Empire conquest]], Havoc Squad's commander went missing. Jorgan and M1-4X were stuck in [[Trench Warfare|trench warfare]] for months, and the unit fell apart after the Republic submitted to Eternal Empire, signing [[Zakuul\u2013Republic treaty]]. Havoc Squad fell apart as Vik returned to the life of crime, Yuun searched the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] for the major, M1-4X was assigned to the [[Press Corps]], and Elara Dorne was removed from Havoc by Chancellor [[Leontyne Saresh]]. As the sole remaining member, Jorgan was promoted to [[Major/Legends|Major]] and given command of a new Havoc Squad,<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter11\" /> which by [[3630 BBY]]<ref name=\"3630 Date\">{{TOR_updates|4.2}}</ref> included [[Dengril]], [[Xaban]], [[Abbeth]], [[Torg]] and [[Kanner]], Jorgan's second-in-command. That year, Havoc Squad received a piece of intelligence from Jonas Balkar that convinced them to take a leave of absence from their official duties and undertake an unsanctioned mission to Zakuul in violation of the treaty. The objective was to wiretap a [[Knights of Zakuul]] listening outpost, gaining access to the Eternal Empire communications. In the [[Endless Swamp]] of Zakuul, Havoc Squad went to an arranged meeting point with an ex-SIS agent [[Theron Shan]] and the [[Alliance Commander|Commander]] of the anti-Zakuul [[Eternal Alliance|Alliance]]. Their meeting was interrupted by [[Skytrooper]]s and Jorgan ordered everyone to split up and meet at the arranged rendezvouz point, teaming up with the Alliance Commander. While sniping off Skytroopers, Jorgan asked the Commander about their opinion on the Eternal [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Arcann]] before explaining how the Republic was descending into tyranny and decadence under ex-Chancellor [[Leontyne Saresh]] and her puppet [[Jebevel Madon]]. Witnessing civilians fleeing from skytroopers, Jorgan and the Commander rescued a group of Zakuulan exiles and stopped the droids from burning their homes before meeting with their leader [[Pashna Veyaad]]. Unwilling to leave civilians behind, Jorgan radioed ahead and ordered Havoc to prepare their camp for the refugees, while clearing the path for them alongside the Commander. Inside the camp, Jorgan ordered Kanner to get the refugees settled in and complimented the Commander for the lives they saved that day, telling everyone to get some rest.<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter11\" />\n\nThe next morning, Jorgan presented his plan for the Alliance, explaining that with access to Eternal Empire communications, Havoc Squad would be able to perform surgical hit-and-run attacks on targets across the [[Spire (Zakuul)|Spire]] while avoiding retaliation. Requiring a big distraction for the attack, the Commander arranged one by the Alliance personnel and proceeded with Havoc towards the main objective. With the rest of the squad proving their cover, Jorgan and the Commander successfully infiltrated the outpost and planted the wiretap, but on their way out were surrounded by skytrooper reinforcements. Fortunately, Zakuulan exiles led by Pashna Veyaad came to their aid, taking out several shuttles worth of reinforcements with rocket launchers, allowing Havoc to pick off the remaining enemy forces. Their mission successful, Jorgan expressed a desire to train the exiles into a proper resistance force. Leaving the rest of Havoc with the rebels on Zakuul, Jorgan then traveled to the [[Alliance base]] on [[Odessen]], where he got acquainted with the Alliance leadership before making his way back to his squad.<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter11\" />\n\nThe success of Havoc's mission revealed the existence of the [[GEMINI]] frequency, the means by which Emperor Arcann controlled the [[Eternal Fleet]]. The Alliance planned an attack on the [[Hyperwave relay station]] hidden ten kilometers beneath the Spire and connecting the [[Eternal Throne]] to the Eternal Fleet. At the briefing, Jorgan strongly insisted to destroy the relay station and sever Arcann's control over the Eternal Fleet, while [[Kaliyo Djannis]] urged the Alliance Commander to help her take control of the Eternal Fleet by slicing the frequency transmitter. The Commander assigned Kaliyo to assist Havoc Squad on the mission, with one of them providing a diversion for the other's main objective. Unfortunately, the Commander went missing and was unable to assist them, so the Alliance had no choice but to proceed with the mission regardless. In the process the contact with the infiltration team was lost, prompting the diversion team to attempt a rescue. At that point, the Spire went into full lockdown with no transmissions coming in or out, making any rescue attempt all but impossible.<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter12\">{{TORcite|exp=kotfe|chapter=12}}</ref> Kaliyo and Jorgan managed to get out and return to Odessen, but four of Havoc Squad's six members were lost in the process, which the Major blamed on Kaliyo. Despite the losses he suffered, Jorgan decided to commit his full effort to the Alliance's cause.<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter13\">{{TORcite|exp=kotfe|chapter=13}}</ref>\n\n===Joining the Alliance===\n{{Quote|We didn't function like a team and other people paid with their lives.|Aric Jorgan|Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire}}\n[[File:Aric_Jorgan_3.png|thumb|left|240px|Jorgan next to the coffins of his men]]\nKaliyo revealed that she managed to grab a data archive on the GEMINI droids from the relay station, making the mission not a total loss.<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter13\" /> This led [[SCORPIO]] to formulate a plan to rewrite the GEMINI protocols by plugging a [[GEMINI Prime]] into a captain's chair on one of the [[Eternal Fleet warship]]s. She then betrayed the Alliance and claimed the Eternal Throne for herself,<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter15\">{{TORcite|exp=kotfe|chapter=15}}</ref> informing Arcann about the Alliance's location. During the resulting [[Battle of Odessen]], Jorgan elected to stay behind on the surface in case of a ground assault. During the battle, Emperor [[Arcann]] was dethroned and his throne was claimed by his sister [[Vaylin]], who allied herself with SCORPIO.<ref name=\"KOTFEChapter16\">{{TORcite|exp=kotfe|chapter=16}}</ref>\n\nJorgan later joined a team assembled by Theron Shan to assist [[Lana Beniko]] and the Alliance Commander in retaking the ''[[Gravestone]]'' from Empress Vaylin and her forces. Theron's shuttle with Kaliyo Djannis, [[Torian Cadera]], [[Vette]], and Jorgan aboard landed inside the hangar of ''Gravestone'' just moments before SCORPIO took control of the vessel and launched it into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] on a locked course. The ship emerged from hyperspace in [[Iokath system]], surrounded by the entirety of the Eternal Fleet. Vaylin attacked the vessel's bridge and overpowered both Kaliyo and Jorgan, but was unable to hurt anyone before a blinging white light engulfed the ship. Alliance members found themselves on the surface of the strange world called [[Iokath]], separated from each other and placed in scenarios that resembled combat simulations. Theron Shan managed to get his cybernetic implant working, contacting everyone and directing them to a structure called the [[Tributary]], as they became aware that not only Vaylin, but every Zakuulan and GEMINI droid from the Eternal Fleet found themselves in a similar situation as well. Jorgan noted that the place familiar to other combat zones he's been dropped to and noted that one Iokath remote patched him up a couple of times, while every other droid only attempted to kill him. When every Alliance member from onboard the ''Gravestone'' got back together, their position in the Tributary came under attack from local hostile droids, forcing them to find another way out.<ref name=\"KOTETChapter4\">{{TORcite|exp=kotet|chapter=4}}</ref> Theron realized that even though he was unable to locate the ''Gravestone'', he could still use his implant to remotely pilot the Alliance shuttle that was left in its hangar. However, when everyone was aboard the shuttle, SCORPIO contacted the group and revealed that [[ARIES]], the droid that controlled Iokath, raised an energy shield that would destroy any vessel attempting to escape. With ARIES re-charging the weapon that incapacitated them to begin with and promising to use it again on a lethal setting, the only way out was to stop ARIES. SCORPIO revealed the location of [[ARIES base|ARIES's base]] and Theron dropped off the Commander and Vette there to deal with ARIES, while the rest went to reclaim the ''Gravestone''. SCORPIO herself arrived to help the Commander defeat ARIES, however the capacitors on ARIES' weapon overloaded, threatening the cover the entire world with a pulse of deadly radiation, which the Gravestone just barely managed to escape to hyperspace to avoid.<ref name=\"KOTETChapter5\">{{TORcite|exp=kotet|chapter=5}}</ref>\n\nVaylin later launched an assault on Odessen, during which Jorgan fought Zakuulan forces on the ground from a sniper position near the Alliance hangar. The Commander was able to land a killing blow on Vaylin, though with the Eternal Throne empty the GEMINI captains went rogue, bombarding worlds such as Coruscant, [[Dromund Kaas]] and Zakuul into rubble.<ref name=\"KOTETChapter8\">{{TORcite|exp=kotet|chapter=8}}</ref> To claim the Eternal Throne and stop the carnage, the Alliance forces departed for Zakuul, Jorgan among them. There, the Commander claimed the Eternal Throne and proclaimed the age of the [[Eternal Alliance]], which Jorgan continued to be a part of.<ref name=\"KOTETChapter9\">{{TORcite|exp=kotet|chapter=9}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Nothing worse than having to choose between the success of your mission and the lives of your men.|Aric Jorgan|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n[[File:Aric_Jorgan_4.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Aric Jorgan]]\nA serious and sober soldier, Jorgan possessed a stoic calm in the face of danger and approached every mission with a stark determination. While many perceived him as highly opinionated and blunt, he was nonetheless completely loyal to [[Havoc Squad]] and the Republic. While respectful of authority, he did not like commanders who goofed off, flirted on the job or committed selfish acts he considered to not be in the best interests of the Republic's citizens.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAric Jorgan appears in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' as a companion character for the [[Trooper/Legends|Trooper]] class, voiced by [[Timothy Omundson]]. He can be romanced and eventually married by the female Trooper, who is also his superior. Following the completion of '''Chapter XI: Disavowed '''in the [[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire|''Knights of the Fallen Empire'']] expansion, Jorgan becomes a companion for all character classes. The expansion also changed Jorgan's weapon from an [[Assault cannon/Legends|Assault cannon]] to a [[Sniper rifle]], including retroactively in the base game.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n===Gameplay Alternatives===\n*At the beginning of class story Act 2, player is promoted to the rank of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] in the Republic military and has to pick either Aric Jorgan or [[Elara Dorne]] to be their executive officer. If Jorgan selected, he will be promoted to his previous rank of [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]], and later become a Captain down the line.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n*During the assault on the [[Gauntlet (Sith Empire)|''Gauntlet'']], player has to pick either Jorgan, Dorne or M1-4X to stay behind and guard the escape route, while assigning the other two to a dangerous mission on the ship's bridge. If Jorgan and M1-4X are assigned to the mission, Jorgan will be seriously injured at the end and will remain recuperating onboard Havoc Squad's [[BT-7 Thunderclap]] until the player completes the class mission on [[Belsavis]], while in other two combinations Dorne is one who gets injured instead.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n*At the end of his companion story, player can allow Jorgan to shoot [[Zane (SIS)|Zane]] for Dark Side points. In this case, Jorgan will later express regret for his actions.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n*In ''Fallen Empire'' '''Chapter XI: Disavowed''', when Jorgan volunteers to train the Zakuulan exiles, player can reject the offer for Dark Side points, instead sending [[Havoc Squad]] to attack more targets rather than wasting their skills on training exercises. Some of his dialogue will play differently is the player is a Trooper, with Jorgan recognizing his former commander and introducing them to the new Havoc Squad, and later explaining what happened to him and Havoc Squad in the past five years.
