Sinis thus recruited a spacer to investigate the ship crash site and retrieve some equipment. The spacer fought several [[Deflarians|Deflarian]] scavengers around the wreck and recovered the flight recorder from the Deflarians. Sinis then requested Yorick to analyze the flight recorder and the slicer discovered that it was modified by the Deflarians.<ref name=\"SWG:CaB\" /> This eventually led to the discovery that the Deflarians hijacked the ship to stole its cargo and then crashed a ship of the same model to cover the theft.<ref name=\"SWG:DC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Deflarian Cleanup|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYorick was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:CaB\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 28 Notes for April 26, 2006|Publish 28]]\", on [[April 26]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 28 Update Notes, April 26th|archivedate=20060427125323}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Crash and Burn}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
