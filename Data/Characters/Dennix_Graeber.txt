You have the honor of being the first Core World leader to welcome the New Republic to its soil! See you soon, Fat Man.|Jerell|Heroes & Rogues}}\n'''Dennix Graeber''' was the [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] of [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"SWAJ7\">{{Journal|7|Into the Core Worlds}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nGraeber was a pudgy man<ref name=\"Heroes & Rogues\">''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''</ref> and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Darpa sector]]'s [[Moff/Legends|Moff]], [[Jander Graffe]].<ref name=\"SWAJ7\" /> He was enthusiastic about oppressive public policies, and dealt with the population with harsh measures.<ref name=\"SWAJ7\" />\n\nGraeber also demonstrated a certain twisted cleverness. He grew quite wealthy smuggling weapons via proxies to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] cells on Ralltiir, enjoying robbing them of funds while using the very weapons he was smuggling to justify further crackdowns on the populace.<ref name=\"SWAJ7\" />\n\nIn [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], Governor Graeber broke a Rebel spy ring in the largest [[Crackdown on Ralltiir|crackdown]] on agitators since the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Subjugation of Ralltiir|occupation]]. It took three weeks of planning, and involved security forces from four of Ralltiir's counties and military units from the governor's Imperial [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]]. In an early morning raid on a Rebel armory in [[Salibury]], Graeber seized 300 tons of weaponry and authorities captured 35 Rebels on-site, leading to the capture of roughly another hundred through interrogations and examination of documents discovered in the raid.<ref name=\"SWAJ9\">{{Journal|9|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Graeber, his rule of Ralltiir was not to last. Following the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] made a push for Ralltiir, which was on the [[Perlemian Trade Route/Legends|Perlemian Trade Route]] at the border with the [[Colonies/Legends|Colonies]] region. After a New Republic strike team led by [[Spike (individual)|Spike]] disabled the planet's [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]], Graeber personally contacted [[Jerell]], a leader in the planet's resistance force who blamed Graeber for the death of one of his daughters. He taunted Jerell, noting the New Republic had yet to take a [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]]. In the midst of the conversation, Spike's strike team took out the planet's generators at the same time that a task force of six [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]s [[Battle of Ralltiir (4 ABY)|arrived]] in-system, and Jerell had the pleasure of informing Graeber that he would be the first governor of a Core World to welcome the New Republic to its surface.<ref name=\"Heroes & Rogues\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|9|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|7|Into the Core Worlds}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''\n*''[[The Far Orbit Project]]''\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graeber, Dennix}}\n[[Category:Governors of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ralltiiri]]"}}}]}}}}
