In [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]] he was at feud with an enraged buyer who thought that Margan had cheated her after she discovered that the ronto she bought from Margan was infested with [[mite]]s. The buyer tried threats, lawsuits and even hired a gang to beat Margan up twice a day. In retaliation, Margan paid a group of freelancers to destroy the buyer's home and property. To prevent this, the buyer paid a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to attack Margan's thugs.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFizzy Fon Margan is mentioned in the missions \"An Aggrieved Customer Is Making My Life Unbearable\" and \"Stop Goons Hired By Fizzy Fon Margan\" in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', that are available to players at mission terminals on Tatooine.
