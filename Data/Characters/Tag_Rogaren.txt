During the construction of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], Rogaren was chief weapon systems engineer. It was he who conceived and built the [[Superlaser/Legends|superlaser]] array of that [[battlestation]]. Following the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of Alderaan by the Empire, Rogaren felt responsible for what happened. He lived aboard the ''[[Audacity]]'', a battered [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]], surrounded by relics of his lost [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. Eventually, Rogaren encountered [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], [[Prince/Legends|princess]] of Alderaan and hero of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]] in [[the Graveyard]] of Alderaan. When the princess discovered who he was, she pointed her [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] on him.<ref name=\"SW09\" /> As Rogaren expressed his regrets and willingness to die, the princess lowered her weapon and left the ''Audacity'', deciding to let him in the hands of the [[Galactic War Crimes Tribunal]] instead of shooting him in cold blood.<ref name=\"SW10\" />\n\nSome time later, the [[Armor/Legends|armored]] [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]&mdash;right hand man of the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]&mdash;discovered that a fighter bearing Rebel Alliance markings had visited Rogaren's den. Vader had Rogaren brought before him so he could be interrogated. Despite the threats of violence, Rogaren refused to give the identity of his visitor, stating that his visitor was nothing but an innocent pilgrim unaffiliated with the Rebels. Seeing that he could not make him talk, Vader ended up [[Death/Legends|killing]] the Alderaanian by strangling him with his powerful robotic right hand.<ref name=\"SW14\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 8|''Star Wars'' (2013) 8]] {{C|Voice only}}\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 9|''Star Wars'' (2013) 9]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 10|''Star Wars'' (2013) 10]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 14|''Star Wars'' (2013) 14]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tag Rogaren#legends\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rogaren, Tag}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Galactic Empire military personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
