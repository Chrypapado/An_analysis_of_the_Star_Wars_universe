Others fight empires. And some put their lightsabers aside and help in smaller ways.|Galen Besk|audio=ToBoldlyGoOrNot-TOR.ogg|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Galen Besk''' was a former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who lived during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]]. A [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]], Galen put aside his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] after the [[Great Galactic War]] and settled on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he believed he could make a better difference by helping settlers. He quickly became a leader amongst the settlers, but remained aware of many of the events on the planet and [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] as a whole. When a Republic-allied individual arrived on the planet, Besk asked the individual for help in solving many of the settlers' problems.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Tatooine's only chance is unity&mdash;making communities that can stand together against warlords and monsters.|Galen Besk|audio=YeahGoodLuckWithThat-TOR.ogg|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]], Galen Besk was originally a member of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] who served during the [[Great Galactic War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]]. After the [[Treaty of Coruscant]] ended the fighting, Besk decided that he could make a bigger difference on a smaller scale, and he left the Order. Besk made his home on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he lived in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. His [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] allowed him to quickly assume a leadership role among his fellow settlers. Through a combination of his [[Force-sensitive/Legends|power]] in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and his position, Besk was able to remain aware of major events on the planet.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n{{GameLS}}\nAround the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3643 BBY]], an operative of the Republic arrived on the planet. Besk was aware of the agent's exploits on the planet, and when a sandstorm hit Anchorhead as the operative was leaving, Besk asked for the individual's assistance in getting people inside the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] and out of the storm. After the sandstorm, Besk revealed his knowledge of the individual's travels and asked the operative to stay and help a little longer, in order to help unify the settlements.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nBesk had learned of the Empire's plans to destroy the trading post of [[Camp Karnori|Espelar]], a nearby settlement. He believed that if the individual helped solve the problems afflicting many of the Republic settlements on the planet, the citizens would be able to better stand up against the native [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]], [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]], [[Warlord/Legends|warlords]], and even the Empire. The sandstorm had disabled the trading post's defenses, prompting the Empire to send in a team of [[Saboteur/Legends|saboteurs]] to eliminate it. Besk asked the individual to stop the saboteurs, using the agent's feelings of responsibility to gain the individual's help.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nThe individual succeeded in defeating the saboteurs, and traveled to Espelar itself to speak with [[Mayor/Legends|Mayor]] [[Airen]]. There, the individual went on to help a number of settlers across the [[Jundland Wastes/Legends|Jundland Wastes]], a region to the south of Anchorhead which lay between the city and the Imperial-controlled town of [[Mos Ila]]. The hero helped train Espelar's militia,<ref name=\"Training\">{{TORcite|type=faction|[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]|Militia Training|[[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]}}</ref> and took the recruit [[Vastil]] and his men to rescue a group of militiamen from [[Manister Base]], a nearby militia base. The base had been overrun by a [[Geonosian hive/Legends|Geonosian hive]], which had seized control of the base's supplies and weapons. The individual held off the [[Geonosian/Legends|Geonosians]] while the militia fled to [[Outpost Largona]] to the south.<ref name=\"Trial\">{{TORcite|type=faction|[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]|Militia's Trial|[[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]}}</ref> The hero also helped recover stolen [[Water/Legends|water]] from the [[Twin Suns (pirates)|Twin Suns]] pirates for [[Dester]] and several other Largona settlers.<ref name=\"Water\">{{TORcite|type=faction|[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]|The Water Pirates|[[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen the operative returned to Besk, he thanked the hero and urged the individual to continue on the journey, warning the individual that enemies were still working against the Republic. When asked how he knew so much, Besk revealed that he was a former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] and thanked the operative again for the help.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Name's Galen. I'm just a man enjoying his retirement, trying to give something back to the community.|Galen Besk|audio=TotallyNotAFormerJedi-TOR.ogg|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nA dark-skinned Miraluka male with [[black]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], Galen Besk lacked [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], as was normal for his [[Species/Legends|species]]. As was also common among Miraluka, Besk made up for that physical weakness by perceiving the environment around him through [[Force sight]]. Like many of his species, he was strong enough in the Force to become a member of the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nAfter the bloodshed of the Great Galactic War, Besk believed that he could make a bigger difference on a smaller scale and left the Jedi Order to settle on Tatooine. Besk assumed a leadership role there, working to help the settlers survive in the harsh environment. While Besk appeared to be gruff, abrupt, and even mysterious at times, he was a true Jedi at heart. He deeply cared for those he protected, even after he left the Order, and he would do everything in his power to protect them. He convinced the Republic-allied individual to help out by playing on their responsibilities, knowing that the individual would help out because of the threat of the Empire.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGalen Besk first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] released by [[BioWare]] on [[December 20]], [[2011]]. He gives Republic players the Tatooine Bonus Series of missions, using his knowledge of the player's Tatooine class storyline to convince them to help. The events he discusses will vary depending upon the character's class. Upon completion of the Bonus Series, Galen Besk can reveal that he was a former Jedi if asked. The quests of the Bonus Series each have their own [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light]] and [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] options, but the overall interactions with Besk remain the same. As Besk is part of the Republic Bonus Series, and therefore is only accessible by Republic players, this article assumes that only the light side options are taken by Republic individuals.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Besk, Galen}}\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Jedi of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Miraluka]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
