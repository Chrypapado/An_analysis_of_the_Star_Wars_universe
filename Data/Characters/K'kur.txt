When the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] erupted between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] K'kur refused to report to the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] and remained at the [[Almas Academy]] where he would die at the hands of [[Phylus Mon]]'s raiders.\n\n==Biography==\nUnlike most Jedi of the era, K'kur studied at the [[Almas Academy]] in the [[Cularin system]] after being discovered to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] by [[Jedi recruiter|recruiters]] of the Jedi Order's [[Acquisition Division/Legends|Acquisition Division]]. Eventually passing his [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]], K'kur went onto become a well respected [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], known for his prowess with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and his courage in battle. It was surprising to many then, when K'kur refused the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council's]] call to arms at the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Invoking his [[Right of Denial]] in joining the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]], K'kur remained on [[Almas]] instead, answering only to the [[Almas Council|Academy's Council of Masters]].<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nWhile other Jedi died across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] during the [[22 BBY/Legends|first year]] of war, K'kur was assigned to protect the ancient [[Almas Sith fortress|fortress]] of the long dead [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Rivan]]. The fortress, long abandoned, had been captured by the Almas Jedi but had not been completely explored, and was in need of protection from assault by the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] sect known as the [[Believers]]. Joined by five other Knights, K'kur was stationed at the south entrance of the fortress while a group of fourteen [[Jedi Researcher]]s explored the interior of the complex. While K'kur was stationed there, a sandstorm swept across the landscape, surrounding the structure. Under cover of the sandstorm, the [[Dark Side Adept]] [[Phylus Mon]] led a group of his followers and a Force-sensitive [[Wampa/Legends|Wampa]] against the fortress. Overpowered, K'kur and the other guards were slain and the fortress was open to the dark siders. Entering the structure, the raiders preformed a Sith ritual over several hours before leaving the fortress once more.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\nIgnorant of the ritual, the researchers reported back to the Almas Council on the mysterious deaths of the guards, resulting in Master [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]] organizing three search teams to investigate the fortress and find those responsible.<ref name=\"AMA\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
