Did you see that big green guy get tossed out by the Wookiee?|A spacer in Saludi's, on Colara's forceful eviction of a Gamorrean from the bar|Coruscani Dawn}}\n'''Colara''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who was employed as a bouncer in [[Saludi's]], a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Coruscant underworld|Undercity]]. Around [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], while on duty at Saludi's, Colara ejected a [[Alcohol/Legends|drunken]] [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] from the bar. Shortly thereafter, she encountered a group of [[Heroes of Cularin|spacers]] who were searching for some [[Believers|Sith cultists]] operating out of a [[Coruscant Believers base|secret hideout]] near to the cantina.\n\n==Biography==\nColara was a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during the last [[Standard decade/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], where she worked as a bouncer at the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] [[Saludi's]] in the [[Coruscant underworld|Coruscant undercity]].<ref name=\"CD\" /> Around [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is placed in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. Therefore, the events of ''[[Coruscani Dawn]]'' can be dated to circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]].</ref> while on duty the bar one [[Standard day/Legends|evening]], Colara spotted a group of bellicose [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] of the [[Mecetti House Guard]], a [[Army/Legends|military]] force from the [[Tapani sector/Legends|Tapani sector]], drinking in Saludi's and she kept close tabs on their behavior, waiting for an excuse to throw them out. Later that night, she observed a group of [[Believers]],<ref name=\"CD\" /> [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]-worshipping<ref name=\"BOTB\">''[[Belly of the Beaast]]''</ref> [[Sith cult|cultists]] from the [[Cularin system]], rushing through the bar, en-route to their [[Coruscant Believers base|secret hideout]] that could be accessed from a concealed back room of Saludi's. Though she did not know who the [[Sith Cultist|cultists]] were or what their purpose was in the bar, Colara paid no heed to their activities because, being [[Human/Legends|Humans]], she saw the Believers as smaller and weaker than her and therefore did not register them as a threat.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\n[[Standard minute/Legends|Minutes]] after the Believers had passed through Saludi's, Colara forcefully ejected a [[Alcohol/Legends|drunken]] 400 [[Kilogram/Legends|kilogram]] [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] from the cantina. At that moment, a [[Heroes of Cularin|team of spacers]] hired by the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], an [[Jedi Order/Legends|order]] of [[The Force/Legends|Force]] users [[Jedi Temple|headquartered]] on Coruscant, arrived at the cantina in pursuit of the Believers. Colara stepped aside and smiled at the [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] as they made their way into the bar.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\n{{RPG|''[[Coruscani Dawn]]''}}\nThe Jedi-allied spacers made enquiries to Colara about the location of the Believers' secret hideout and the bouncer reported to them details of her sighting of the cultists who had passed through the bar. After a Wookiee member of the spacer team agreed to go on a date with her, Colara also disclosed to the spacers the existence of the hidden back room of Saludi's and provided details on how to access it, via the cantina's [[Refresher/Legends|restroom]]. Subsequently, the spacers found the entrance to the Believers base and confronted the cultists.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nColara was a healthy Wookiee and large and strong, even by the standards of her [[Species/Legends|species]], which were renowned for their size and robustness. She flirtatious toward other Wookiees and aside from some missing [[Tooth/Legends|teeth]] was considered attractive by others of her race. She was courteous and professional while on duty as a bouncer at Saludi's and was not interested in any bribes offered to her. A diligent bouncer, she focussed her attention on looking out for potential trouble-makers in the bar.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nColara was created by [[Morrie Mullins]] and appeared in ''[[Coruscani Dawn]]'', a [[2002]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] adventure that formed part of [[RPGA]]'s [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign. In the adventure, the players roleplay as the spacers who come to Saludi's while tracking the Believers. It is possible for the players to interact with Colara and make inquiries to her regarding the cultists. Only if one of the player characters is a Wookiee and that character agrees to go on a date with her does Colara reveal to the players details of the Saludi's hidden back room and provide them information on how to enter it. It is also possible during the adventure for a brawl to break out between the player characters and the [[House Mecetti]] pilots drinking in the bar, in which case Colara quickly intervenes to break up the fight.<ref name=\"CD\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Coruscani Dawn]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
