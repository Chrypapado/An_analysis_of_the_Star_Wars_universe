Perhaps blossom wine from ''Naboo''... along with ''another'' of that world's treasures?|Jib Kopatha, to Darth Vader|Empire 19}}\nAn '''unidentified Naboo female''' lived on [[Void Station]], working as a servant for a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] named [[Jib Kopatha]], during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Vader]] arrived to Void Station, planning to extract information from Kopatha. After a short battle between two of the Bothan's guards and Vader, Kopatha tried to calm the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] down by offering him various off-world \"delicacies\", such as food, beverages and women.\n\nAmong them was a young [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]] female, offering Vader [[blossom wine]]. He stared at her for a few seconds, which prompted the young woman to ask him if something was wrong. Vader bluntly answered her \"no\" and quickly turned away, as the woman presumably reminded him of his late wife, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Empire 19|''Empire'' 19]] {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Servants]]\n[[Category:Unidentified females]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]"}}}]}}}}
