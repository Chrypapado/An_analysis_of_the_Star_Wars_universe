He was [[Fynn Torve]]'s contact for smuggling food and basic supplies to the [[Gado Hill Clans]]. Han Solo suspected him to be an extremist religious figure, based on his title and a [[Color/Legends|black]], [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]]-embedded [[Necklace/Legends|necklace]] he wore. The Reverend played along with this characterization, making others believe he sought the elimination of all [[Gambling/Legends|gambling]]. He caused a scene at the LoBue and accused [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] of cheating at [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]], causing a scene that eventually enabled Solo, [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], and Torve to escape the scrutiny of the Abregado security forces.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reverend}}\n[[Category:Abregado-rae]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
