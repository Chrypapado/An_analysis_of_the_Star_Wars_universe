You remove yourself..&hellip;|The Sand People chieftain|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\nThe '''Sand People chieftain''' was the leader of a [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]] [[Unidentified Tusken Raider tribe (Jedi Civil War)|tribe]] residing in an [[Sand People Enclave|enclave]] within the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Seas]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], southwest of [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[3956 BBY]], [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and the crew of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'' arrived on the desert [[Planet/Legends|world]] in search of the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Star Map]] located there. When [[Gender/Legends|he]] and his party stole into the Sand Peoples' enclave wearing robes taken from a [[Death/Legends|dead]] ambush party, ostensibly on a mission for [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]] to destroy the Sand People, they were able to meet with the chieftain and discuss terms for a cessation of hostilities, thanks to [[HK-47]]'s translation abilities. In exchange for providing the tribe with [[Moisture vaporator/Legends|moisture vaporators]] so that they could build up supplies of [[Water/Legends|water]], the chieftain agreed to move the tribe further away from the settlement and reduce their attacks on [[Miner/Legends|miners]]. Revan asked for the attacks to stop completely, but the chieftain said it would never happen because outsiders were constantly desecrating their customs and they needed to respond accordingly. Revan agreed to the deal and promised to give him the vaporators. The chieftain said he would wait but he did not believe the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] would return.\n\nWhen Revan does unexpectedly return with the vaporators, the chieftain then agreed to release a trio of captive [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] in addition to [[Griff Vao|Griff]], the elder brother of [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] party member [[Mission Vao]]. Though the chieftain stated he still did not trust Revan, he presented his [[Gaderffii|gaffi stick]] to the Jedi as a gesture of good faith. Eventually, the chieftain led his people to another part of Tatooine.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn one alternate ending, the chieftain allows Revan and his party to free [[Griff Vao]] and the imprisoned Jawas in exchange for a [[Krayt dragon pearl/Legends|krayt dragon pearl]].\n\nIn the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] ending, Revan somehow gives the Sand People cause to attack him, thus resulting in the party killing the entire Sand People tribe. Though it is not always dark sided. If Revan talks to the chieftain without HK-47, the tribe will attack.\n\nIf the player uses HK-47 to negotiate peacefully they can still have the chieftain and his tribe attack Revan if the player attempts to open any of the containers in the Enclave.\n\nIf Revan talks to the chieftain about their history he can learn that there is one storyteller in the village. You must first prove yourself as a warrior by killing a [[Krayt dragon/Legends|krayt dragon]] and bring back the pearl. The chieftain doesn't believe you will do this but when you do, you can bring him the pearl and you will gain access to the [[The Storyteller (Sand People)|Storyteller]]. There you can learn the mysterious history of the Sand People. If you're not careful asking questions despite HK-47's warnings the whole tribe may attack.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\n}}\n\n[[Category:Chiefs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Tusken Raiders]]\n[[Category:Unidentified political figures]]"}}}]}}}}
