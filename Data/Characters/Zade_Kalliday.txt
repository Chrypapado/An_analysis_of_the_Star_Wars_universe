If you need something smuggled, I'm your man.|Zade Kalliday|Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire}}\n'''Zade Kalliday''' was a [[Gender|male]] [[smuggler]] who operated from the [[starship]] ''[[Midnight Blade]]''. When attempting to smuggle cargo onto [[Batuu]], Kalliday was stopped by the [[First Order]], who seized his cargo and [[Death|killed]] his partner, [[Valoss]]. After landing on Batuu, Kalliday visited [[Oga's Cantina]], where [[Vi Moradi]] saved him from First Order [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]]. Kalliday later joined Moradi's group of [[Resistance]] fighters.<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You're asking for compassion at this hour?

Vi Moradi recruited him to the Resistance because of his charisma and ability to recruit sympathetic people to their cause. Zade acted as though he cared about nothing but himself and harming the First Order, but he was once close with the [[Devaronian]] smuggler [[Valoss]] and hesitant to care about others for fear of losing them similarly. However, he bonded with the [[Chadra-Fan]] mechanic and slicer [[Kriki]].<ref name=\"Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Poe Dameron: Free Fall]]''\n*[[Poe Dameron: Free Fall (audiobook)|''Poe Dameron: Free Fall'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire]]'' {{1st|[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire (audiobook)|''Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire (audiobook)|''Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire'' audiobook]]\n*{{Shortstory|story=Black Spire: Return to a Shattered Planet|book=Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kalliday, Zade}}\n[[Category:Bartenders]]\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance members]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
