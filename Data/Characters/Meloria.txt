Discovered to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] soon after her birth, Meloria was inducted into the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] to be [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Meloria passed through her training half-heartedly; always resenting the fact that her destiny was supposedly predetermined. During her upbringing within the Order, she came to like the physical aspects of the Force above all else, and her quick reflexes and fighting prowess only grew as she immersed herself in martial studies. After a time, she was selected as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] by a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]], who was greatly impressed with her extraordinary abilities.<ref name=\"CCW\" />\n\nFollowing the path of a [[Jedi Guardian]], Meloria [[Jedi Trials/Legends|gained]] the rank of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]. Shortly after her [[Knighting ceremony/Legends|graduation]], however, her trust in her reflexes betrayed her. While attempting to arrest a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], Meloria accidentally [[Death/Legends|killed]] an innocent bystander. She became distraught and found herself unable to deal with the anguish; she severed all ties with the Jedi Order and vowed to never use the Force again. Meloria fled to the nearby planet of [[Drall (planet)|Drall]], where she made her home within a cave on a small island in the [[Boiling Sea]]. She lived on the island alone for quite a while, farming the land to survive and becoming forgotten by the rest of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Her isolation only served to deepen her sense of loss, and soon she settled upon a drastic decision.<ref name=\"CCW\" />\n\nNow thirty [[Standard year/Legends|years]] old, Meloria used the last of her [[Galactic Credit Standard|savings]] to purchase a [[cryogenic hibernation capsule]]. Safe inside her cave, she then froze herself within the unit. Meloria knew that if the Force willed it, she would be free, but until that time, she'd remain in stasis.<ref name=\"CCW\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMeloria was a bitter woman who lacked dedication to teachings other than those of martial disciplines. She enjoyed nothing more than physical prowess and the honing of her exceptional reflexes.\n\nShe was never fully committed to the [[Jedi Code/Legends|teachings]] of the Jedi Order. Yet when she took an innocent life, even by accident, she felt a deep and terrible loss and became grim and withdrawn.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAmong the [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] Meloria mastered during her time as a Jedi were [[Force speed]], [[Force healing/Legends|Force healing]], [[Force empathy]], and [[Force stealth]].\n\nShe also possessed stunning reflexes and was an able [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|combatant]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Meloria\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Guardians]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Knights]]"}}}]}}}}
