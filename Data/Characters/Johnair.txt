He raced [[Han Solo]] in [[speeder]]s in order win 10,000 credits. Early in the race, Johnair's speeder was damaged by Moloch's speeder, forcing Johnair to finish the race on foot.<ref name=\"LEGO All-Stars\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCreators [[Bill Motz]] and [[Bob Roth]] named Johnair after podcasters Aaron Goins and Johnamarie Macias. The pair host Star Scavengers, a Lego Star Wars podcast that primarily reviewed the canon adjacent Lego Star Wars tv show, The Freemaker Adventures.\n\nWhilst it is unknown whether Johnair will ever return to screens, Aaron Goins has speculated on Twitter, positing his belief that Johnair was perhaps trying to finance a rebel cell or earn a living for his family. Bob Roth (perhaps somewhat jovially) commented that the characters 'waters run deep' and that there were 'Many stories to tell'.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{All-Stars|The Chase with Han/Escape with Chewbacca}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Dowutin]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Racers]]"}}}]}}}}
