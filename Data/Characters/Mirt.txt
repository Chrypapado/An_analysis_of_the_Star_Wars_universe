During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Mirt participated in a discussion on the nature of the benefits and problems caused to Cularin by the world's [[Platform city|platform cities]]. After the [[Tarasin]] [[Kaguya]] argued that the platform [[City/Legends|cities]] encroached on Tarasin land and were detrimental to the Cularin ecosystem, Mirt began insulting her, stating that she was a \"[[Barklovers|bark-lover]]\" and a \"backward reptile\".
