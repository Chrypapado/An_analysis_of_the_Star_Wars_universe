The engineer eventually bought Quagga's freedom, and the Wookiee set up a repair shop in the outskirts of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine's]] [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. However, his methods were expensive, his location remote, and the local [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] were fierce competition. With his business failing, Quagga resolved to enter [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt's]] [[Jabba's demolition games|demolition contests]] using a fully refurbished [[Armored Assault Tank|AAT]] in hope of securing a large enough fortune to set up shop in the center of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]].\n\nQuagga's fate is largely unknown. Accounts are conflicting, placing him both as a slave to Jabba the Hutt and as the winner of enough prize money to achieve his dream.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Tiny Death Star]]'' {{Nc}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Demolition]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Demolition: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Quagga\n|ru=\u041a\u0432\u043e\u0433\u0433\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Imperial slaves]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
