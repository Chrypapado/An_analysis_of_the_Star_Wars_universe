Please, stop fighting!|Vazus Mandrake, breaking up a fight between some [[Jungle Felucian/Legends|Felucian]] scouts and a team of [[Alderaanian Resistance]] agents|The Traitor's Gambit}}\n'''Vazus Mandrake''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. He was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and, by the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], was in his middle ages. Mandrake commanded a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] unit that had been hired by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], a separatist government that was fighting the Republic, and he was sent to fight on the planet [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]]. However, during the [[Battle of Felucia (Outer Rim Sieges)/Legends|battle]], Mandrake's unit was wiped out by Republic [[Troop/Legends|troops]], and Mandrake fled into the Felucian jungle.\n\nMandrake nursed himself back to health and, following the end of the Clone Wars and the [[Declaration of a New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], went to live with a group of [[Jungle Felucian/Legends|Felucians]]. He stayed with them in a [[Felucian Sanctuary|village]] deep in the Felucian jungle, where he encountered a group of [[Alderaanian Resistance]] agents who were passing through the forest. An Imperial [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout trooper]] flew by the [[City/Legends|village]] on a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]], so Mandrake persuaded the agents to leave and prevent the [[Trooper/Legends|trooper]] from reporting the village's location to the Empire.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Clone Wars===\nVazus Mandrake was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] who was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and was in [[Gender/Legends|his]] middle ages by the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Mandrake was the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] of a group of [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] who were hired by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], a separatist government that was fighting the Republic. During the later stages of the war, he and his [[Troop/Legends|troops]] were sent to fight on [[Felucia/Legends|Felucia]], a jungle-covered planet that was located in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]]. They brought with them a group of [[Kybuck/Legends|kybucks]],<ref name=\"TTG\" /> a [[Species/Legends|species]] of ungulate creatures that were native to the planet [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] and could be used as mounts.<ref name=\"Data Bank\">{{DB|creature|kybuck|kybuck|archivedate=20110908154025}}</ref> During [[Battle of Felucia (Outer Rim Sieges)/Legends|a battle]] against Republic forces there, Mandrake's unit was attacked and destroyed by several Republic [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]]. Mandrake was seriously injured in the engagement, and he was able escape from the troopers by crawling off into the Felucian jungle.<ref name=\"TTG\" />\n\nAlone in the jungle, Mandrake nursed himself back to health. Some of the kybucks had survived the battle, so Mandrake tended to them and named them after his fallen comrades.<ref name=\"TTG\" /> Elsewhere, the leaders of the Confederacy were [[Mission to Mustafar/Legends|executed]] by the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], ending the Clone Wars and leading to the [[Declaration of a New Order|reformation]] of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], a more authoritarian government.<ref name\"Episode III\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> When Mandrake learned of the existence of the new government, he decided to go and live with the [[Jungle Felucian/Legends|Felucians]], Felucia's native [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] species.<ref name=\"TTG\" />\n\n===Life with the Felucians===\nMandrake went to live with a group of Felucians at a [[Felucian Sanctuary|remote village]] that was located deep in the jungle. They accepted him into their community, and he learned to speak [[Felucianese]], which he eventually became fluent in. However, when the Empire established [[Vanishing Place|a prison]] on Felucia, many of the Felucians from the village were [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]] in the [[Prison/Legends|facility]], where its commander, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vischera]], carried out experiments on them. This made Mandrake angry, and he planned to sabotage the facility, although he didn't believe he could do so by himself.<ref name=\"TTG\" />\n\nAfter the Imperial [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gilder Varth]] began aiding the [[Alderaanian Resistance]], an anti-Imperial rebel group, the admiral was sent to the Felucian prison by the Empire. [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Prestor Organa]], the leader of the Resistance, responded by [[Mission to Felucia (Imperial Period)|dispatching]] a group of agents to Felucia to free Varth. However, as they trekked through the jungle on their way to the facility, they came to the edge of the village where Mandrake lived. Believing them to be Imperials, some Felucian scouts from the village attacked the Resistance agents. Mandrake realized from their appearances that the agents were not Imperials, so he intervened and broke up the fight.<ref name=\"TTG\" />\n\nThe agents entered the village and Mandrake conversed with them, as he was curious about why they were on Felucia. However, a short time later, they were interrupted when an Imperial [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout trooper]] from the prison flew by the village on a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]]. This worried Mandrake, as he believed that the trooper would report the village's location to the Empire, who would launch an attack on the village. However, Mandrake realized that, as the chemicals released by mushrooms that grew in the area blocked long-range communications, the trooper wouldn't be able to report in until it arrived back at the prison. If the trooper was stopped, the village would be safe, so Mandrake begged the Resistance agents to take his kybucks and chase after the Imperial. The agents agreed and after mounting the kybucks, they rode off in pursuit of the speeder bike.<ref name=\"TTG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMandrake had a scarred face and stringy [[Color/Legends|gray]] hair. Although he was generally a genial person, he felt bitter toward the Empire because of his defeat during the Clone Wars. His dislike of them was increased by the presence of the Imperial prison on Felucia, which he wanted to destroy. However, he was unwilling to attack it by himself; living with the Felucians had made him a more measured person, and he was not as eager to fight as he had been when he was a mercenary.<ref name=\"TTG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMandrake was created by writer [[Rodney Thompson]] and made his first and only appearance in ''[[The Traitor's Gambit]]'', the first scenario in the ''[[Dawn of Defiance]]'' campaign, a [[Wizards of the Coast]] online supplement to the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]''. In the supplement, the players role-play as the Alderaanian Resistance agents and their actions can influence what Mandrake does. After the player characters have fought the Felucian scouts, if the players are unwilling to enter the Felucian village, then Mandrake invites them in. Once they enter the village, Mandrake offers to act as a go-between for the players and the villages, if the players did not bring a [[Translator droid/Legends|translator droid]] with them. If the players reveal to Mandrake that they are opposed to the Empire, then he becomes very friendly with them and treats them like old friends. If they tell him that they are going to the Imperial prison, then he gives them an explosive device and asks them to detonate it in the prison's communications center, which he believes would destroy the entire structure.<ref name=\"TTG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/dodcampaign|text=The Traitor's Gambit|int=The Traitor's Gambit|archivedate=20100118064618}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mandrake, Vazus}}\n[[Category:Felucia residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Separatist military members]]\n[[Category:Soldiers]]"}}}]}}}}
