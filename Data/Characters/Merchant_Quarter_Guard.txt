He was an [[Officer/Legends|officer]] who patrolled the [[Merchant Quarter]] in [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]].\n\n==Biography==\nWhen [[Meetra Surik]] arrived to the Quarter, the Guard was arguing with [[Ponlar]], an individual who was protesting against [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia's]] government and who was trying to instigate a riot. After a debate with Ponlar, the Guard decided he had gone too far with his protests and that he would be arrested.\nPonlar asked Surik to join his cause, but she refused to help him. The Guard later thanked Surik for having stopped Ponlar.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Exile, as the player, can choose to support Ponlar and can kill the guard with the help of the angry crowd.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Onderon military personnel]]\n[[Category:Onderon Royalists]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified military personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
