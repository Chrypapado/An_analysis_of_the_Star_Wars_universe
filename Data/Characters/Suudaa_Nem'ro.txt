All you see in Jiguuna is under my authority. Welcome.|Suudaa Nem'ro|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Suudaa Nem'ro''' was a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] who lived during the [[Great Galactic War]] and the subsequent [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|reconstituted Sith Empire]]. He was most often known simply by his ''[[cuirvas]]'', ''Nem'ro''. Secretly, Nem'ro was also a member of the [[Star Cabal]], an intergalactic secret society dedicated to destroying both galactic powers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Life on Nal Hutta===\n{{Quote|The upstart Fa'athra lays claim to things that are mine. He moves against my factories, sends his scum to make trouble in Jiguuna.|Nem'ro explains his rivalry with Fa'athra|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nIn the decades leading up to his success, Nem'ro was a cunning leader in the gangs of [[Jiguuna]], an industrial [[City/Legends|town]] on the Hutts' adopted [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Hutta]]. He was an ambitious Hutt, using blackmail and savage cunning to systematically muscle his way into complete control over the town. His businesses included [[shvash gas]] mining, dealing [[Spice/Legends|spice]], and trafficking weapons. His path to success earned him enemies along the way including fellow Hutt [[Voontara Fa'athra]], \"[[Huttsbane]],\" and even [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]].<ref name=\"HoloNet Bio\">{{Holonet|old=true|biographies|nemro-hutt|Nem'ro the Hutt}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], his rivalry with Fa'athra became so intense that Fa'athra sent [[Fa'athra gang|forces]] into Jiguuna to attack Nem'ro's interests.\n\n====Allying with the Sith Empire====\nLike most Hutts who reach the peak of their career, Nem'ro left the day-to-day operation of his enterprises to underlings while he concentrated on food and revelry in [[Nem'ro's Palace|his palace]] on Nal Hutta.<ref name=\"HoloNet Bio\" /> His closest associates, for a time, included the lieutenants [[Karrels Javis]] and [[Toth'lazhen]], as well as the enforcer [[Kaliyo Djannis]], and [[Nem'ro's gang|his street gang]] leader, [[Rex Geer]].\n\nHis operations did not go unacknowledged for long during the Cold War, as the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]] took a keen interest in the Hutt and his control over the gas industry. The [[Imperial Intelligence (Sith Empire)|Imperial Intelligence]] spymaster known as [[Keeper (Imperial Intelligence)|\"Keeper\"]] sent [[Cipher Nine|an operative]] to infiltrate Nem'ro's court and gain his allegiance. Assuming the identity of the space pirate known as the \"[[Red Blade]],\" the agent gained the trust of Nem'ro and his closest men, carrying out several tasks on their behalf.\n\nIn the end, after framing the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] for having aided Fa'athra in assassinating Karrels Javis and his bodyguards inside Nem'ro's palace itself, and gaining [[holodisc]] evidence of this, the agent succeeded in driving Nem'ro to the Imperials. The Hutt soon contacted nearby [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] embassies, and Keeper expected to have him on the Empire's side within the month.\n\n====Great Hunt====\n{{Quote|Be polite, Carnus. This bounty hunter has been sweeping the filth from my town's lovely streets.|Suudaa Nem'ro to [[Carnus]]|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nNem'ro also eventually sponsored the [[Hunter (individual)|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] of the late [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Braden]] after the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 assisted the Hutt with his business, killing several targets, and finally killing the [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] hunter [[Rarsk]] in [[Fa'athra's Palace]], acquiring the sponsorship token Nem'ro had given him. Nem'ro's sponsored hunter would go on to win the competition.\n\n===Assassination===\n{{Quote|The average Hutt lifespan is a thousand years. Nem'ro was only six hundred. ''Stupid'' bounty hunter!|[[Archiban Frodrick Kimble|Archiban Kimble]], after hearing that his cure wouldn't make the ''[[Journal of Xenomedicine]]''|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nIt was later revealed that Nem'ro was infected with a seemingly incurable [[Suudaa Nem'ro's disease|disease]], which was eventually cured by [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Archiban Frodrick Kimble|Archiban Kimble]]. Despite the doctor's hard work, Nem'ro was then killed by [[Skadge]], the Houk having escaped [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]] and eventually tracking him down, ending the Hutt's life.\n\n{{Expandsect}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNem'ro the Hutt was first mentioned in a development diary for the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' released by [[BioWare]],<ref name=\"VD3\">{{TORweb|url=news/article/20090717_002|text=The Voice of the Old Republic}}</ref> and later appeared in the opening storylines for both the Bounty Hunter and Imperial Agent classes on Nal Hutta.\n\nNem'ro's biography page on the official website contained several phrases in [[Aurebesh/Legends|Aurebesh]]. When transliterated, they read \"Supports Hutt Cartel Neutrality,\" \"Houk and Rattataki Bodyguards,\" and \"Betrayed Skadge.\"<ref name=\"HoloNet Bio\" />\n\nWhile not explicitly identified as Nem'ro, the <nowiki>[hutt_conspirator]</nowiki> NPC that appears in the cutscenes on the [[Star Chamber (space station)|Star Chamber]] during the Imperial Agent's class story finale is identical to Nem'ro; [https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en/npc/16140994008449077100 analysis of the character model] shows that it uses the <nowiki>[npp.creature.hutt.nemro_a01]</nowiki> blueprint, which features different colored eyes and is used only by the various Nem'ro NPCs throughout the game. Thus, as several other members of the Star Cabal are characters who appear in the other classes' storylines, such as [[Kolovish]] and [[Nok Drayen]], it can be concluded that Nem'ro was a member of the Star Cabal.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance]]'' {{1stm|''The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance'' audiobook}}\n*[[The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance (audiobook)|''The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Holonet|old=true|biographies|nemro-hutt|Nem'ro the Hutt}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWTOR_Wiki}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Suudaa Nem'ro\n|es=Suudaa Nem'ro\n|pl=Suudaa Nem'ro\n|ru=\u0421\u0443\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0430 \u041d\u0435\u043c'\u0440\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nem'ro, Suudaa}}\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Members of the Star Cabal]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
