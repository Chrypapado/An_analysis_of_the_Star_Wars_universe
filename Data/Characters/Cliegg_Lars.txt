Shmi is my wife.|Cliegg Lars introduces himself to Anakin Skywalker, his stepson|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\n'''Cliegg Lars''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[moisture farmer]] from [[Tatooine]]. He had one son, [[Owen Lars]], from his first marriage. In the [[Standard year|years]] prior to the [[Clone Wars]], he met [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]] and freed her from [[slavery]] before marrying her. As such, he was the step-father of [[Anakin Skywalker]], and the step-grandfather of [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].\n\nShortly before the [[First Battle of Geonosis|outbreak]] of the [[Clone Wars]], Shmi was captured by a band of [[Tusken Raider]]s. Lars and [[Cliegg Lars' quadrille|a number]] of other moisture farmers attempted to save her, but the sand people drove them back, and Lars lost his right leg as a result. Anakin Skywalker later arrived on Tatooine, having had visions through [[the Force]] of Shmi's suffering and met Lars. Skywalker found his mother, but she died in his arms and he returned her body to the [[Lars Homestead|Lars moisture farm]] for [[burial]], where Lars said goodbye to his wife before dying sometime later.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Thirty of us went out after her.

Lars fell in love with Shmi and bought her from Watto,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> thus freeing her from slavery. The two married and lived together as husband and wife for many years. Approximately, one month before the [[First Battle of Geonosis]], however, Shmi was kidnapped by a group of [[Tusken Raider]]s. An enraged Lars [[Cliegg Lars' quadrille|gathered]] dozens of other farmers and set out to rescue his wife. Although thirty farmers went out looking for her, only four returned alive. Lars himself returned maimed, having lost his right leg to the sand people.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\nA month after Shmi's disappearance, her son, [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] arrived on the farm looking for her, having had [[The Force|Force]] visions of her suffering. Lars and his [[Lars family|family]] met Skywalker for the first time and explained to him what had happened with the Tusken Raiders. Although Lars told his stepson to accept that Shmi was gone, Skywalker was determined to find his mother and set out into the desert to locate the sand people. He found them and his mother, but she died in his arms. Skywalker returned to the farm after slaughtering the Tusken Raiders for revenge, with his deceased mother. Skywalker quietly blamed them before he and, along with Lars and his family, [[Burial|buried]] Shmi on the farm next to Lars's brother and [[parent]]s.<ref name=\"SWCT\">{{SWCT|Cliegg Lars - Moisture Farmer - Base Series 1|Cliegg Lars - Moisture Farmer - ''Base Series 1''}}</ref> Skywalker left shortly thereafter, leaving the Lars family behind and taking the droid C-3PO with him.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> Soon after these events, Cliegg died, passing on the moisture farm to his son and his daughter-in-law [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]].<ref name=\"Ultimate SW\" /> He was buried alongside his second wife, Shmi, sometime after his death at the Lars Moisture Farm on Tatooine.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\">[[Darth Vader (2020) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 1]]</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nAt some point, Owen and Beru were assumed to have removed the headstone from Cliegg Lars and Shmi Skywalker's graves as a way of protecting the true identity of their nephew [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" />\n\n[[Standard year|Years]] later, Skywalker, who had now become the [[Sith]] [[Sith Lord|Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader, revisited the homestead where Lars had once lived before his death in order to find more information on his son, Luke Skywalker, who had recently escaped him during their [[Duel on Cloud City|duel]] on [[Cloud City]]. As they arrived, the [[droid]] Vader had brought along, [[ZED-6-7]], listed off the former residents of the homestead, giving Vader flashbacks for each one, including Cliegg.
