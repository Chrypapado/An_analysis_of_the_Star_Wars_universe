In fact, the attacks were part of a plot of the crime lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] to pressurize the mayor and eventually take control of the city. During that time, Crix Yarrow visited [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]] and stayed in a local [[Bestine Hotel|hotel]]. During his visit, he watched an [[entertainer]] perform for him. However, the entertainer was sent by [[Anetia Kah'ryn]] and was actually there to learn some information from Crix about the sinister plot being carried out in Mos Eisley. Anetia, a performer herself, found that patrons were more willing to divulge information after they have been entertained. Indeed, Crix agreed to speak to the entertainer, and simply revealed that there was some criminal boss who wanted to control Mos Eisley. Unfortunately, that was all the information he knew. Anetia Kah'ryn was finally able to discover the truth and expose the whole plot to Mayor Mikdanyell Guh'rantt.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:TemplateNobleMale.jpg|250px|thumb|Every possible depiction of Crix Yarrow]]\nCrix Yarrow was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Crix Yarrow was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 17 Notes for 26 May 2005|Publish 17]]\", on [[May 26]], [[2005]].<ref name=\"SWG:2005\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref> He was part of a quest given by Anetia Kah'ryn to beginner players who had chosen a career of \"[[W:c:swg:Entertainer (pre-NGE)|entertainer]]\".<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> During each server reset, his appearance and [[Species/Legends|species]] would fluctuate, but he was consistently depicted as a male.<ref name=\"SWG:TEL\" /> Anetia Kah'ryn's quest was removed from the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]],<ref name=\"SWG:2005\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Total Experience}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Entertainer's Life (quest)|The Entertainer's Life}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Yarrow, Crix}}\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
