In [[3956 BBY]], she was at the [[Upper City Cantina]] with a friend. When her order was delayed, she mistook [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], a [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]], for a [[Bartender/Legends|waiter]]. This sparked a short argument that ended when her drinks finally arrived.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Where did you get those clothes&mdash;a trash compactor in the Lower City?|Gana Lavin, to Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nGana Lavin was a young [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Noble/Legends|noble]] from the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. As a child, she enjoyed many of life's luxuries living in the [[Upper City]]. Lavin would occasionally use [[Bodyguard/Legends|enforcers]] employed by her [[Gana Lavin's father|father]] to harass others, which led many to consider her a spoiled brat.<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:LavinCantina.png|thumb|left|250px|Gana Lavin in the Upper City Cantina with a Noble Youth]]\nIn [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Lavin was present in the [[Upper City Cantina]] buying drinks for herself and a [[Noble/Legends|noble]] when [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Carth Onasi]], both [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]], approached her. Lavin mistakenly believed them to be [[Bartender/Legends|waiters]], insulting their choice of [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]] and demanding to know why her order had not yet arrived. Revan apologized and attempted to explain that he wasn't an employee of the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], but Lavin refused to listen and threatened to use her [[Parent/Legends|father]]'s influence to have Revan dismissed. Revan persuaded her not to become upset and agreed to bring Lavin her order. At that point, a [[Waiter/Legends|waiter]] arrived bearing Lavin's and her friend's drinks, defusing the situation and allowing Revan and Onasi to leave.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Why is the help here so incompetent? One word from Daddy and I could get you fired!|Gana Lavin threatens Revan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nLavin commonly used her enforcers and her father's reputation to threaten others. When her drink order at the Upper City Cantina was late, she grew impatient and angrily commented on the incompetence of the cantina staff. Lavin bluntly expressed her dislike of Revan's clothing, and her rudeness led Onasi to call her a \"spoiled brat.\"<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|How dare you speak to me like that! Daddy's going to hear about this!|Lavin's response to one of several dialogue options|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nLavin first appeared as a non-player character in the [[2003]]<ref name=\"KOTOR release\">{{SW|url=news/kotor-galaxy-of-heroes|text=BioWare and Capital Games on Bringing ''KotOR'' Fan Favorites into ''Galaxy of Heroes''}}</ref> ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' [[video game]], in which the player, Revan, can interact with her. Throughout the conversation, the player has several dialogue options to choose from. However, the nature of the conversation is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n[[File:LavinThugs.png|thumb|right|250px|Lavin and her enforcers. Lavin appears with black hair.]]\nIf the player fails to persuade Lavin into thinking he/she is the waiter and her drinks will come by soon, or if the player yells at Lavin, she will take offense and complain to her father. She later has two [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] thugs wielding [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblades]] attack Revan outside the cantina near [[Kebla Yurt]]'s [[Kebla Yurt's Equipment Emporium|Equipment Emporium]]. After the player defeats them, she screams for her \"daddy\" and runs away. It should be noted that during this encounter, Lavin is portrayed with [[black]] hair.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gana Lavin\n|es=Gana Lavin\n|nl=Gana Lavin\n|pl=Gana Lavin\n|ru=\u0413\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043d\n|fi=Gana Lavin\n|esGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lavin, Gana}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
