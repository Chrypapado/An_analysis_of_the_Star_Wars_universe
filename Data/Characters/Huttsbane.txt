He raids my holdings and hides in a swamp village.|[[Suudaa Nem'ro]]|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''\"Huttsbane\"''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Evocii]] and an enemy of the [[Hutt Cartel]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]. In [[3643 BBY]], he resided in a village near [[Jiguuna]] on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Be careful, little bounty hunter. Huttsbane once blasted into other palace. Killed pile of captains--murdered a mighty Hutt!|[[Carnus]]|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nDetesting the Hutts' enslavement of his people, Huttsbane openly opposed [[Suudaa Nem'ro]] and the entire [[Hutt Cartel]], even breaking into a palace and murdering an unnamed [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. Nem'ro, believing the Hutts to be the rightful masters of the Evocii, dispatched an [[Hunter (individual)|aspiring]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] seeking sponsorship for the [[Great Hunt (competition)|Great Hunt]], to track down Huttsbane and bring back his head.\n\nWhen the bounty hunter fought through hoards of Huttsbane's comrades in the village of [[Baratatta]] and confronted him, [[Baratatta Spirit-Leader|the village's Spirit-Leader]] attempted to break a compromise, explaining the Evocii's plight and appealing to the Hunter's sense of honor.\n\n{{GameDS}}\nThe hunter, however, followed through on the contract and killed Huttsbane, bringing his head before Nem'ro.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Here is the head of a fallen warrior. Nem'ro is a great fool. He will accept it as Huttsbane's. Now please, go.|The Spirit-Leader gives the Hunter the head of a fallen Evocii as a substitute for Huttsbane's.|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nThe player has the option of agreeing to the Evocii elder's compromise of allowing the hunter to take a head from another fallen Evocii instead of killing Huttsbane.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Cartel Market|''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' Cartel Market]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Holonet|biographies|nemro-hutt|Nem'ro}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n*<!-- 2012/10/15 -->''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Huttenfluch\n|ru=\u041f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0445\u0430\u0442\u0442\u043e\u0432\n}}\n\n[[Category:Aliases, nicknames, and pseudonyms]]\n[[Category:Evocii]]\n[[Category:Freedom fighters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
