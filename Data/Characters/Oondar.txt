He wanted to get rid of fellow [[Merchant/Legends|merchant]] [[Geeda (Nar Shaddaa)|Geeda]] by bribing the Exile. However, the plan backfired and the Exile forced Oondar to move. Oondar then threatened the Exile, saying that he would get the Exchange to attack her.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the player chooses the dark-side option, then the Exile removes Geeda and Oondar gives the player a discount.
