Patience, my friend.|The Emperor and Darth Vader, in Sith tongue, on Drua and her village|Lords of the Sith}}\n'''Drua''' was a [[Gender|female]] [[Twi'lek]] who lived on [[Ryloth]] in a remote [[Drua's Village|village]] settlement, along with [[Drua's grandfather|her grandfather]]. Some five [[Standard year|years]] following the end of the [[The galaxy|galactic]] conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]], Drua came upon the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious]] and his [[Sith apprentice]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] as they escaped from the [[lylek]] [[cave]]s of Ryloth. Unaware of their identities or of the [[Mission to Ryloth|ongoing skirmish]] on Ryloth, Drua welcomed the two [[Sith Lord]]s and the [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Royal Guard]] [[Erstin Deez]] to her village, where the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] later attacked the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] trio. Although Drua, her grandfather, and the rest of her village fled into the nearby [[mining]] shelter for safety during the attack, the Emperor&mdash;seeing them all as living witnesses&mdash;had Vader [[Death|kill]] the Twi'lek villagers, including Drua, once the Free Ryloth movement had been neutralized.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|My mother died two winters back. I didn't know my father.''\"<br />\"''Not unlike you, apprentice.|Drua to the Emperor, as he speaks to Darth Vader|Lords of the Sith}}\n[[File:Ryloth_system.png|thumb|left|300px|Drua lived on the planet Ryloth, in a remote village that lacked contact with the world outside it.]]\nDrua was [[Homeworld|native]] to the [[planet]] [[Ryloth]], homeworld of the [[Twi'lek]]s. Drua never knew her [[Parent|father]], and [[Drua's mother|her mother]] [[Death|died]] some three [[Standard year|years]] following the end of the [[The galaxy|galactic]] conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]]. Drua lived with [[Drua's grandfather|her grandfather]] in a remote [[Drua's Village|village settlement]], which had been formed in the wilderness by Twi'leks that had once been escaped [[mining]] [[Slavery|slaves]] and may have been [[refugee]]s of the Clone Wars.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nAround five years after the end of the Clone Wars, which had seen [[Imperial Era|the rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], Drua was in the forests near her village checking on hunting traps when she heard an explosion come from the nearby [[cave]]s. She explored the incident and witnessed the [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious]], his [[Sith apprentice]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], and the [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Royal Guard]] [[Erstin Deez]] exiting a cavern's tunnel. However, the trio, whom had just destroyed a [[lylek]] hive in the caves, were unknown to Drua, as she and the rest of her village were unaware of the events of the world outside of their settlement. Instead, Drua believed the trio had either crashed in a [[starship]] or was simply lost and needed assistance.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nIn an attempt to eliminate Drua, the Emperor used a [[mind trick]] with [[the Force]] to compel Drua to come to him, as he planned to strike her down with his [[lightsaber]]. Vader, however, intervened, and acted preemptively against his [[Sith Master]], stopping the Emperor's blade from striking the Twi'lek down. Vader suggested&mdash;while Drua was still absent-minded due to the Emperor's mind trick&mdash;that her village could be of use to them, as the trio had been traversing the caves to avoid their hunters, the members of the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] who sought to assassinate them. The Emperor agreed and compelled Drua to lead the Imperial trio to her village.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nDrua discussed some of her personal life with the Emperor as they made their way through the forest, after which they traversed through hills and a quarry on the way to the village. At the foot of the quarry, Drua introduced the trio to [[Narmn]], who guarded the outskirts of the village. The Emperor introduced himself and Vader as \"Krataa\" and \"Irluuk,\" in reality meaning \"death\" and \"fate\" in old [[Sith tongue]], as Deez was introduced as [[Sergeant]], his [[officer]] rank. Narmn, like Drua, welcomed the three into their village, as deemed by customary traditions.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n[[File:Lords_of_the_Sith_mission.png|thumb|300px|Drua was oblivious to Sidious and Vader's Sith identities. In the end, the Twi'lek and her village were all wiped out by the Sith Lords.]]\nIn the village, Drua introduced the Emperor, Vader, and Deez to the rest of the villagers&mdash;which included her grandfather, [[Mala (Twi'lek)|Mala]], and the [[Reproduction|pregnant]] [[Naria]]&mdash;before her people celebrated their guests with music and [[Foodstuff|food]]. As the Twi'leks gathered with the Imperials, the Emperor had Drua bring Vader the village's broken [[Comlink|communicator]] to have the [[Sith]] repair it, which Vader promptly did, impressing Drua. As communications had returned for the Empire, having previously been knocked out by the Free Ryloth rebels, Deez hailed the Ryloth [[Moff]] [[Delian Mors]] on the comlink to rendezvous with the Moff's forces.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nIn the midst of the village celebrations, Drua and the others were alarmed by the sudden barrage of [[blaster]] bolts grazing their buildings and setting some of them on [[fire]]. These were warning shots from [[Cham Syndulla]] and his Free Ryloth movement, as the group had finally caught up with the Emperor's company and sought to bring no harm to the villagers. As the villagers fled into the nearby mining tunnels, the village's fortified hideout, Drua tried to bring the trio with her by tugging at Vader's cape. The Emperor refused, however, and instead commanded Vader to eliminate the rebels while Deez stayed by his side. Vader pushed Drua away, which angered her, just before the Twi'lek girl joined her village in the tunnels.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nIn the brief skirmish that followed, Drua and her fellow villagers witnessed Vader strike down countless members of the Free Ryloth movement before ultimately defeating them in battle. Once the battle ended, Vader executed one of the movement's leaders, a Twi'lek named [[Isval]], before the Emperor told his apprentice that Drua and her people were living witnesses to [[Mission to Ryloth|what had transpired]] and that they had to be eliminated. Vader obeyed his Master and entered the tunnels alone, where he slaughtered all of the villagers, including Drua.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Dialogue|The Emperor|What's your name, girl?|Drua|Drua.

And why do you wear that&hellip;suit?|Erstin Deez|My name is Sergeant, and it's my honor to wear this armor.|attr=Drua, unaware of their identities, speaks to the Emperor and the Royal Guard Deez|src=Lords of the Sith}}\nDrua was a curious Twi'lek, as she actively sought the source of the explosion near the lylek caves before she encountered Darth Vader and the Emperor. Drua also followed her Twi'lek customs when she welcomed the Imperial strangers to her village, having no knowledge on any of their identities whatsoever, which displayed her own na\u00efvety. This was, however, due to her village's remoteness and lack of communication with the world outside of it. Similarly, Drua was unable to resist the persuasive [[Force power]]s of the Emperor when he compelled her mind to obey him, remaining without thought even as he and Vader [[Lightsaber combat|dueled]] before her.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\nPhysically, Drua had the distinctive [[lekku]] of a Twi'lek and [[Color|green]]-colored skin. At the time of her death, Drua appeared to be of an adolescent age and had a discernible accent when speaking in [[Galactic Basic Standard]]. She also spoke and understood her native tongue, [[Twi'leki|Ryl]].<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nDrua wore a parka to shield herself from the constant rain or wind of Ryloth, and carried a backpack for her gear and a [[lylek tube]], which was a wooden sound instrument used to keep lyleks away. She also kept a holstered [[blaster pistol]] from the bygone Clone Wars.<ref name=\"LOTS\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDrua made her first appearance in the [[Canon|new canon]]<ref name=\"LOTS canon\">{{SW|url=news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line|text=Disney Publishing Worldwide and Random House Announce Relaunch of Star Wars Adult Fiction Line}}</ref> ''[[Star Wars]]'' novel ''[[Lords of the Sith]]'',<ref name=\"LOTS\" /> released in [[2015]] and written by [[Paul S.
