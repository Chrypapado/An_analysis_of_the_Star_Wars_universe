He had bitter feelings of rivalry rival of the [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsister]] [[Charal]], the cohort of [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Do not worry. I will shield you from King Terak's rage once he hears that his men have been killed. I will make it seem as if Charal's treachery was responsible for their deaths.|Szingo|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Szingo paid an [[Spacer/Legends|individual]] 75 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to take care of three [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] and their leader to get his disintegration weapon. Soon after this, he discovered that [[Charal]] had sent some Marauders under her command to raid the pirate's crashed ship, ensuring that Szingo could not find anything else. This angered Szingo who ordered the individual to kill the Marauders who had performed this act. Upon doing so, he rewarded the individual with 150 credits. Unfortunately, Charal managed to convince [[King/Legends|King]] [[Terak]] that she had nothing to do with the attack, and so Szingo hired the individual one last time. This time he was to eliminate an [[Arachne]] which had been attacking the Marauders outposts as a way to be forgiven. Once this was done, Szingo rewarded the individual with 350 credits.<ref name=\"SWG\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSzingo was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', which gave quests to players as part of the \"Marauder Themepark.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|scenario=''The Shaman's Staff'' promotional scenario}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Educators]]\n[[Category:Endorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sanyassans]]"}}}]}}}}
