Lots of droids.|Hesk Beldross, to [[LN-73]]|Something Uffel}}\n'''Hesk Beldross''' was a [[Thaere Privo|Thaereian]] investor, who lived during the time of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Beldross owned the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[LN-73]] and sent it to the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Uffel]], to obtain some droids. However, LN-73 became stranded in orbit of the moon and over 50 years later, in about [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], was knocked onto Uffel by a debris storm. The droid immediately began to try and fulfill Beldross' orders, by attempting to take control of droid production on Uffel.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Something Uffel]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beldross, Hesk}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Thaereians]]"}}}]}}}}
