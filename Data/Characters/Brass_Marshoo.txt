He once served in the [[Gungan Grand Army/Legends|Gungan Grand Army]] as a [[General/Legends|general]]. He disliked the thieves [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]] and [[Roos Tarpals/Legends|Roos Tarpals]]. After Tarpals became a [[Captain/Legends|captain]], Marshoo claimed that he used his status to protect Binks, who often stole food. One such time, Marshoo became particularly enraged, interfering with Tarpals' arrest of Binks. In his anger, he knocked Tarpals unconscious to get at Binks. Binks, with help from Tarpals' [[Kaadu/Legends|kaadu]] managed to fend off Marshoo. After regaining consciousness, Tarpals tied Marshoo up and then arrested Binks.\n\nHe later opened a restaurant called [[General Marshoo's Eatery]] at [[Otoh Gunga/Legends|Otoh Gunga]]. He also resided at the [[Varykino/Legends|Lake Retreat]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], sometime following [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBrass Marshoo was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]].
