Having come to Nallastia for a [[Zoologist/Legends|zoological]] expedition, to study the indigenous fauna, the Firewells unlawfully trespassed (even though they possessed tourist passes issued by the office of [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor's]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]], whose authority the warriors did not recognize: they served only the [[Skull Queen]]). As a result, Princess Calvaria imprisoned the couple within an [[Force field/Legends|energy field]].\n\nIn the foothills of Nallastia's [[Volcano/Legends|volcanic]] [[Mount Octan]], Klay soon met and befriended the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], who\u2014remembering his own [[Shmi Skywalker Lars/Legends|mother]], bound against her will to [[Slavery/Legends|slavery]]\u2014traveled to the [[Skull Queen's fortress]] and took the princess hostage, in order to bargain for the release of Klay's parents. Calvaria's mother, the [[Margravine]] [[Quenelle]], acquiesced and teamed up with Skywalker's [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to locate the [[Lost Stars of Nallastia]], three ancient jewels that could disable the energy field. The hunt was a success, culminating in the [[Cavern of Screaming Skulls]], and Klay's parents were freed.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars Adventures 2: The Cavern of Screaming Skulls]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Firewell, Klay}}\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
