In ancient times, Hynestians were known throughout [[the galaxy]] as great travelers and sometimes conquerors. By the [[time]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], however, they were mostly known for farming a [[Hair|fur]]-like [[lichen]] called [[gherlian fur]].\n\nHynestians living on their homeworld during the [[Imperial Era]] were ruled by the Empire-aligned [[Hynestian royal family]], which possessed a [[Hynestian royal fleet|private fleet]] alongside a [[Hynestian Royal Guard|security force]] to govern the populace. However, the Hynestian military was once evaded by [[smuggler]] [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], who assisted a rebel royal family member, [[Prince]]ss [[Rinetta Gan]], in returning a [[Solstice Globe|sacred artifact]] of the planet [[Livno III]].<ref name=\"Lando's Luck\" />\n\nA score of<ref name=\"TROS\">[[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']]</ref> [[Hynestian Star Cruiser]]s<ref name=\"Ships\">{{SWKidsYoutube|bb3vhWXClTY|Every Ship in the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy &#124; Star Wars By the Numbers|archiveurl=https://archive.is/9wQCj}}</ref> participated at the [[Battle of Exegol]] as part of a vast [[Citizens' Fleet]]&mdash;an [[Fleet|armada]] of volunteer civilians gathered by Lando Calrissian from throughout [[the galaxy]]&mdash;to bring down the returning [[Sith]] threat raised by the resurrected [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious]].<ref name=\"TROS\" />\n\n{{Species-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Lando's Luck]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Lando's Luck (audiobook)|''Lando's Luck'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWKidsYoutube|bb3vhWXClTY|Every Ship in the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy &#124; Star Wars By the Numbers|archiveurl=https://archive.is/9wQCj}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Human races]]\n[[Category:Hynestians| ]]"}}}]}}}}
