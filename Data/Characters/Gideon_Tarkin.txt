Wilhuff and Gideon Tarkin both attended the same military academy before graduating and entering the [[Republic Outland Regions Security Force]]. Gideon Tarkin attained the rank of brigadier before returning to Eriadu, as Wilhuff did, to enter a career in government. Tarkin became the planet's [[Minister of Security]], in which capacity he served until the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Tarkin returned to Republic service, taking a position in the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]] and commanding the Republic's efforts to defend Eriadu in the embattled [[Seswenna sector/Legends|Seswenna]] and [[Sluis sector/Legends|Sluis sectors]]. Tarkin's military success gained him praise as he continued to loyally serve [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] under the rule of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], but Wilhuff outstripped his younger brother, rising meteorically to the lofty rank of Grand Moff. In [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]], Tarkin died in the course of the [[Erhynradd Mutiny]]. He was survived by his teenage daughter, [[Rivoche Tarkin|Rivoche]], who went on to defect to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Service to the Republic===\n{{Quote|The Jedi order has the full support and cooperation of Eriadu and the Seswenna sector.|Gideon Tarkin|HoloNet News Vol. 531 56}}\nGideon Tarkin was born into the prestigious and powerful [[Tarkin family/Legends|Tarkin family]] of [[Eriadu/Legends|Eriadu]] in the waning days of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. He had an older brother, [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]].<ref name=\"Cracken's Rebel Operatives\" /> The two youths entered a prestigious military academy and, on graduating, joined the [[Republic Outland Regions Security Force]], an anti-piracy task force which served to defend the area around Eriadu.<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> Tarkin eventually left military service to enter government on Eriadu. There, [[Brigadier]] Tarkin served as the [[Minister of Security]] for Eriadu's government as of [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]].<ref name=\"IBC Denies Arming Separatists\" />\n\nAt that time, as the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]] grew, Gideon Tarkin was a visible public figure in the Republic's efforts to counter the secessionist movement. Tarkin appeared on the Eriaduan news program and talk show ''[[Essence]]'' for an interview with host [[AndroosinLiann]], and he later announced Eriaduan port authorities' seizure of a shipment of [[InterGalactic Banking Clan/Legends|InterGalactic Banking Clan]] [[IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank/Legends|Hailfire droids]] destined for the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] world [[Praesitlyn]] in the nearby [[Sluis sector/Legends|Sluis sector]], a major coup which sparked an investigation of whether the InterGalactic Banking Clan was secretly aiding the Separatists.<ref name=\"What to Scan\">{{Hnn|51||What to Scan|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728120105/http://www.holonetnews.com/51/}}</ref><ref name=\"IBC Denies Arming Separatists\" /> As Separatist activity spread into Eriadu's [[Seswenna sector/Legends|Seswenna sector]], Tarkin negotiated with the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] to bolster the sector's defenses, managing to get a squadron of Jedi [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor/Legends|Delta-7 ''Aethersprite''-class light interceptors]] assigned to Eriadu.<ref name=\"Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds\" /><ref name=\"Jedi Starfighters Moved to Eriadu Base\">{{Hnn|56|jediwatch/13516_1.html|Jedi Starfighters Moved to Eriadu Base|https://web.archive.org/web/20130831160547/http://www.holonetnews.com:80/56/jediwatch/13516_1.html}}</ref> Tarkin personally welcomed the Jedi detachment to the [[Eriadu Planetary Security Launchport]] in a public ceremony before speaking with [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Hyris-Well Madorin]], the leader of the contingent, concerning increasing security for the vital [[Rimma Trade Route/Legends|Rimma Trade Route]], on which Eriadu lay and which was threatened by Separatist strength in the neighboring Sluis sector.<ref name=\"Jedi Starfighters Moved to Eriadu Base\" />\n\nIn short order, the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] erupted between the Republic and the Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems. Tarkin returned to Republic service, serving once more as a brigadier in the newly formed [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]]. Eriadu soon became the center for operations in that area of space, which was highly contested. It was Tarkin who oversaw the theater of war, commanding a fleet at Eriadu, which he made a bastion against the Confederacy and used as a staging point for attacks against enemy forces. Working with several squadrons of Jedi, Tarkin held out against the Separatists, but his situation was made much worse when, [[21 BBY/Legends|just over a year into the war]], [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]], the area's other major Republic stronghold, defected to the Confederacy. Tarkin responded to the secession by calling up planetary defense forces, merging them into \"priority theaters\", and coordinating their offensive deployment from Eriadu. Tarkin's strategy was set back by a betrayal from within which saw the Republic lose the [[Battle of Sullust (Republic traitor)|Battle of Sullust]], but his forces still managed to recapture much of the Sluis sector.<ref name=\"The New Essential Chronology\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\n===Imperial===\n{{Quote|When Senator Palpatine declared himself Emperor, it was all too easy for the Tarkin line to swear fealty to the New Order.|Airen Cracken, in Alliance Intelligence notes|Cracken's Rebel Operatives}}\n[[File:Rivoche_Tarkin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Gideon Tarkin's daughter, Rivoche Tarkin]]\nWhen [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] reformed the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Tarkin eagerly gave the new, authoritarian government his allegiance, as did Wilhuff. As Wilhuff rose through the ranks of the Empire, eventually becoming a [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]], Gideon Tarkin found himself outshone by his brother's successes. Nevertheless, the younger Tarkin still found success under the Empire, being known as a talented commander and maintaining a high-class lifestyle. He also had a family, siring a daughter, [[Rivoche Tarkin]], around [[18 BBY/Legends|18 BBY]].<ref name=\"Cracken's Rebel Operatives\" /> Tarkin split his time between Eriadu and the galactic capital, [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], moving among the elite.<ref name=\"Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds\" /><ref name=\"Dark Empire Sourcebook\">''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]], Tarkin died in the [[Erhynradd Mutiny]].<ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" /> In honor of his brother, Wilhuff took young Rivoche into his home.
