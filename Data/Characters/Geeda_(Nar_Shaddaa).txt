She was a trader and owned a shop on the Smugglers' Moon while working as a spy for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]. Geeda encountered [[Meetra Surik]] when the latter came to the planet in search for [[Zez-Kai Ell]], a missing [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]].\n\nFellow merchant [[Oondar]] wanted to remove Geeda because she was stealing his customers and offered Surik a discount if she would promise to do so. Geeda, in response, matched the discount. Oondar then threatened Surik; however, Surik decided to let Geeda stay and removed Oondar after hearing Geeda's words of wisdom about the two possible paths in the scenario&mdash;one quick and easy, the other longer and perhaps more fulfilling&mdash;which served as a metaphor for Surik's choices in pursuing the light or dark side of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].\n\nAfter extending her search for the [[Lost Jedi]] to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] and [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], Surik offered Geeda trading between her shop and [[Khoonda]] and the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]]. This greatly helped Geeda's business by getting her new items for lower costs.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the player decides to pursue the dark-side option, the Exile removes Geeda instead of Oondar and gets a discount from the latter.\n\nAfter getting Onderon stabilized, the exile can talk to Geeda and establish a trade route and the exile can buy a HK pacifism package and when the player installs it into HK-47, he acts kind, and gentle but the player eventually gets tired of him and takes it out.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
