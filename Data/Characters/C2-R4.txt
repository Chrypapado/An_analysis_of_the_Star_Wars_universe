The barman [[Wuher/Legends|Wuher]] found one such droid in a [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] alley. The droid was previously owned by some [[Jawa/Legends|Jawas]] who intended to use him for spare parts, but he was able to escape due to a faulty [[Restraining bolt/Legends|restraining bolt]]. He begged Wuher for help, however was abandoned because of Wuher's intense dislike for droids. One of the Jawas who previously owned C2-R4 later found and re-claimed him; but once again escaped when Wuher, after a realization and change of heart drove the Jawa away and claimed C2-R4 for himself. The droid later helped to create Wuher's perfect liqueur, notably after the novice [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]] was [[Death/Legends|fatally]] blasted by [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and Wuher converted C2-R4 into a makeshift distillery. He then fed the stiffening corpse of the unlucky [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] into the droid's shredder, piece by piece. Allegedly, the resulting cocktail was exquisite, at least to [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] tastes.\n\nSome months after Wuher and C2-R4 had started making specialty drinks, bandits broke into Wuher's hovel and devastated the place. They also stole Ceetoo's special mixology circuit board (which Wuher had taken out to clean), assuming that it was an important piece of data for the bartender. Wuher hired a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to track down and take care of the bandits, while he tried to find the pieces to put C2-R4 back together.<ref name=\"Star Wars Galaxies\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' - Tatooine terminal mission \"Wuher's Droid Dilemma\"</ref>\n\nC2-R4 was a jumble of mixed-up droid parts. He had the body of an [[R2-series astromech droid|R2 unit]], a number of bulbs and appendages (such as whip-like extensors) on his sides, and an opening in the middle of its face with a grill and seemingly, a set of sharp teeth. The droid had many capabilities including catalytic fuel conversion, enzymatic composition breakdown, bacterial composting acceleration, and chemical diagnostic programming as well as meal preparation, toaster oven, [[bang-corn]] air-popper, and blender. C2-R4 also had the programming of a protocol unit enabling him to speak in [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] instead of [[Binary/Legends|Binary]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Be Still My Heart: The Bartender's Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars Saga|pack=Wuher With Cantina Bar Section|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/sw02wmcantinawuher.asp|archivedate=20190530143137}}\n*{{FFCite|22|CAN2, ''Mos Eisley Cantina Characters''}}\n*{{FFCite|67|CAN18, ''Mos Eisley Cantina Characters''}}\n*{{FFCite|79|JAW10, ''Jawas''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|wuher|Wuher|archivedate=20110517074434}}\n*{{InsiderCite|134|Mon Mothma's 5 Facts}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=C2-R4\n}}\n\n[[Category:Droids with masculine programming]]\n[[Category:Second-degree droids]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
