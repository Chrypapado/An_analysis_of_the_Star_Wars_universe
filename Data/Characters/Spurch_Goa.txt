He was assigned to the inquest of a [[drill instructor]] named [[Thaffe]], who had been accused of [[Death/Legends|murder]] aboard a [[Space station/Legends|space station]]. Goa solved the crime and exonerated Thaffe, resulting in a strong friendship. Goa moved on to work as part of a [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff's]] security detachment until Thaffe retired. The pair volunteered to become [[Sector Ranger/Legends|Sector Rangers]], where, over a five [[Standard year/Legends|year]] stretch, they made a name for themselves by stopping [[Slaver/Legends|slavers]] and [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]].<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\nWhile working a case, Goa and Thaffe ran into fellow Sector Ranger [[Dyyz Nataz]]. Thaffe had trained Nataz in anti-[[Terrorist/Legends|terrorist]] operations two years previously, and the trio agreed to cooperate on the case. Nataz had discovered a [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] [[Forger (profession)/Legends|counterfeiting]] operation based on an old [[Ore/Legends|ore]] [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]]. While infiltrating the [[Starship/Legends|starship]], they were ambushed by [[Gank/Legends|Ganks]] on the order of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], who had set a trap as revenge for being harassed by investigators. Goa and the other two were [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] for hours without revealing any information; eventually the Ganks made the trio play [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] to determine which of them would die first. Thaffe intentionally lost, causing the Ganks to execute him immediately. Goa, enraged by Thaffe's death, and Nataz managed to free themselves and dispatch the Ganks before setting the freighter on a course to destroy a palace asteroid owned by Jabba.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\nGoa and Nataz were relieved of duty, and a [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] was levied on them by Jabba. The pair fought off attempts on their lives by [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]], eventually recycling their equipment and becoming bounty hunters themselves.<ref name=\"DESB\" />\n\nGoa was saved from [[Gorm (cyborg)|Gorm the Dissolver]] by young [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]], whom he took as an apprentice. Greedo sold Spurch information detailing a covert [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] munitions facility in the warehouse district on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Spurch in turn sold this information to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] for 60,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. He paid 200 credits worth to Greedo for the tip on the Rebel Base and split the rest with his current partner [[Dyyz Nataz]].\n\n[[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] used this information to lay siege to the [[Corellian Sector (Nar Shaddaa)/Legends|Corellian Sector]] district where the Rebels were hiding. Soon after this event, Spurch boarded his ship, the ''[[Nova Viper]]'' and traveled to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. He introduced Greedo to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] and helped to secure him an exclusive contract to hunt down the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].\n\nA short time later, Spurch met with two [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] bounty hunters named [[Thuku]] and [[Neesh/Legends|Neesh]]. They were of the [[Chattza Clan]] working for the warlord, [[Navik|Navik the Red]]. The Rodians wanted to assassinate Greedo, but didn't want to take the responsibility of doing the job themselves. Goa betrayed Greedo to the thugs of Navik, arranging for Greedo's fatal last encounter with Han Solo.\n\n==Notes==\nIn the [[Diollan]] tongue, the name Spurch meant ''brave bug-catcher''. Goa hated the name and adopted the nickname \"Warhog\" in order to make himself appear more fierce to his fellow bounty hunters.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale]]'' / [[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)|webstrip]]\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|14|Crimson Bounty}} {{Mo}}\n*[[Dark Empire 3|''Dark Empire'' 3]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Dark/large/greedo.gif|cardname=Greedo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]'' {{ID|Warhog Goa}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars Saga|pack=Greedo (With Cantina Bar Section)|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/sagacantgreedo.asp|archivedate=20051109200349}}\n*{{FFCite|13|BOU11&ndash;12, ''Bounty Hunters &ndash; Greedo''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 1]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode304.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Sphere of Influence|archivedate=20110629044401}} {{Imo}}\n*{{DB|character|greedo|Greedo|id=eu|archivedate=20100414132600}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'' {{C|Card: Neesh}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-not-so-magnificent-seven|text=The Not-So Magnificent Seven|int=The Not-So Magnificent Seven}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Spurch Goa\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goa, Spurch}}\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Diollans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Naval Intelligence Agency personnel]]\n[[Category:Sector Rangers]]"}}}]}}}}
