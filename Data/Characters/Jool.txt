How's business?|[[Cade Skywalker]]|Legacy (2006) 14}}\n'''Queen Jool''' was the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] owner of two [[Cantina/Legends|cantinas]] who doubled as an [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] and also a member of the [[Hutt Ruling Council|Hutt Grand Council]] during the [[Second Imperial Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nJool was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] who spent several [[Standard year/Legends|years]] running [[Rik's Cantina/Legends|Rik's Cantina]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], where she enforced a strict no-fighting policy. The self-proclaimed [[Queen/Legends|Queen's]] left eye had been replaced by a jeweled and feathered [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic implant]] that allowed her to observe the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina's]] goings-on. She lived in a swamp below the bar,<ref name=\"Leg 0.5\" /> but being in the [[Coruscant underworld|Underlevels]] required an escort to get there safely.<ref name=\"Leg 16\">[[Legacy (2006) 16|''Legacy'' (2006) 16]]</ref> A [[Nautolan/Legends|Nautolan]], [[Jak (Nautolan)|Jak]], served as her bodyguard with unquestionable loyalty, and Queen Jool was friendly with her bartender [[Finn (bartender)|Finn]] as well.<ref name=\"Leg 14\">[[Legacy (2006) 14|''Legacy'' (2006) 14]]</ref>\n\nIn their days serving [[Rav]], [[Cade Skywalker]], and [[Jariah Syn]] made frequent visits to Rik's, as did spacers [[Chak (Wookiee)|Chak]] and [[Kee (Devaronian)|Kee]], becoming friends with all of them, taking a special fondness for Skywalker.<ref name=\"Leg 14\" /> In her days as [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] agent \"Morrigan Corde,\" [[Morrigan Corde|Nyna Calixte]] would often come to Jool for information.<ref name=\"Leg 16\" />\n\n===Helping Cade Skywalker===\n{{Quote|You know I love you, Cade, but you're getting expensive to keep. Try to keep the damage down this time? For me?|Queen Jool to Cade Skywalker|Legacy (2006) 43}}\nAfter freeing himself from Rav's service, Cade became the captain of his own ship, the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']]. With Syn and [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] [[Deliah Blue]], the three continued to frequent Jool's presence.<ref name=\"Leg 14\" />\n\nUpon his visit to Coruscant to rescue the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Hosk Trey'lis]], Cade Skywalker gave Jool the access codes to the [[Mynock/Legends|''Mynock'']]. Cade trusted Jool to give the codes to Syn and Blue if he did not return,<ref name=\"Leg 14\" /> which she did after Cade freed them from the [[Sith Temple]]. [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] then played a holorecording from Cade to the two, telling them to take the ''Mynock'' and flee [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. Chak and Kee then arrived, intent on retrieving their ship, the ''[[Grinning Liar]]'', which they had rented to the crew for their flight off [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]]. However, they had lost it to Rav when he betrayed them, and so Syn offered the ''Mynock.'' The [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] and the [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] were not interested, however, and said they would help rescue Cade if they were promised the ''Grinning Liar'' afterwards. Reaching an agreement, the four, Artoo, Jak, and Jool then began formulating a plan to retrieve Cade from the Temple.<ref name=\"Leg 16\" />\n\n[[File:Paradise_(cantina).jpg|thumb|left|225px|Jool in the ''Paradise'']]\nThey weren't sure where to start, however, until Morrigan Corde, sitting at their table with a large stack of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], spoke up, surprising everyone and causing them to draw their [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] on her. Jool exclaimed not to shoot her ''yet,'' as she began reaching for her files before remembering Corde's identity. Jool introduced her as an Imperial Intelligence agent she speculated was retired, as she had not seen her for two decades. Corde reminded her that she hadn't seen her now, and taking the money, Jool asked Jak to escort her home. With her help, the motley crew formulated a plan which was ultimately successful in the end.<ref name=\"Leg 16\" />\n\nLater, Jool opened a new cantina on [[Zeltros/Legends|Zeltros]] called the [[Paradise (cantina)|Paradise]]. There she welcomed Cade, Syn, and Blue after their run in with Corde on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Jool explained that with the [[One Sith|Sith]] tightening their control over [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], legal supplies were becoming scarce, making her business very profitable. She also expressed her appreciation for the Zeltron people, especially the males. Shortly afterwards, Rav appeared with some henchmen. Jool told Cade that while she loved him, his rowdiness in her cantinas were becoming costly, and asked him to keep the damages to a minimum. He obliged, knocking them out by throwing one off the waterfall and chopping the other in the neck. Rav then offered Cade and his crew a mission on [[Wayland]] for one million credits.<ref name=\"Leg 43\" />\n\n===Hunting Vul Isen===\n{{Quote|My apologies, sweets patogga. I may have spoken ''too'' highly of you.''\"<br />\"'''S okay Jools&hellip; I know you love me.|Jool and Cade Skywalker|Legacy (2006) 49}}\n[[File:JoolSorry.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jool apologizes to Cade for putting him in danger.]]\nFollowing the death of [[Azzim Anjiliac Atirue]] during a [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Sith Imperial]] [[Devastation of Da Soocha|massive attack]] on [[Da Soocha]] and [[Napdu]], Jool contacted Cade. She asked him to meet her and other Hutt leaders on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] in the [[Vedo Anjiliac Atirue's headquarters|headquarters]] of [[Vedo Anjiliac Atirue]], leader of the [[Anjiliac]] Atirue.<ref name=\"Leg 48\">[[Legacy (2006) 48|''Legacy'' (2006) 48]]</ref>\n\nThere, after being separated from his companions, several of Vedo's [[Security droid/Legends|security droids]] attacked Cade. Nevertheless, Skywalker easily dispatched them with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. Vedo apologized for the trap, stating that he needed to test if Cade was really as good as Jool claimed he was. Jool herself also apologized to Cade, stating that she perhaps spoke of him ''too'' highly. Skywalker promptly forgave her. Vedo then asked Cade to kill [[Vul Isen]], whom Cade was already hunting for his role in the [[Genocide on Dac]], as an agent of the Hutts. Skywalker accepted, and ultimately killed Isen on [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]].<ref name=\"Leg 49\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Queen_Jool_LECG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Queen Jool]]\nJool was sly, flirtatious, and suave. As might be expected of a being which profited from information, she had a certain insight into psychology and motivation. She was fond of Cade, though, and despite the traditionally mercenary behavior of Hutts, it appeared genuine. She welcomed him and his friends everytime they paid her a visit, and even gave him drinks on the house. Cade trusted her with the ''Mynock''{{'s}} codes, and she gave them to Syn and Blue like he asked. When Vedo had his droids attack Cade to test him, Jool apologized for boasting a little too much about him. She was, nevertheless, not above scolding him, asking him to avoid causing too much damage in her cantinas.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Jool}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 14|''Legacy'' (2006) 14]] {{1st}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 16|''Legacy'' (2006) 16]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 43|''Legacy'' (2006) 43]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 48|''Legacy'' (2006) 48]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jool\n|es=Jool\n|pl=Jool\n|pt=Jool\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Hutt Council]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]"}}}]}}}}
