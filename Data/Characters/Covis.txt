Sorry, ma'am|Covis interrupts Leia Organa in a message to Tace|Princess Leia 4}}\n'''Covis''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Alderaanian]] who lived in the [[Alderaan Enclave]] on the [[Volcano|volcanic]] [[planet]] [[Sullust]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. After the [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], [[R2-D2]] and the [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] saved members of the Alderaan Enclave from a [[stormtrooper]] raid, Covis joined Organa's [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to rescue the survivors of [[Alderaan]]. While questioning some of her decisions, he remained loyal to Organa.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Alderaan Enclave===\n{{Quote|You're suggesting we ignore an alarm? I wonder what your motive might be.''\"<br>\"''I am saying outright. Mr Covis that it could be a diversion from something bigger, or a charade to draw us out.|Covis and Jora Astane discussing the arrival of intruders into the Alderaan Enclave|Princess Leia 3}}\nCovis was a member of [[Preserver]] [[Jora Astane]]'s [[Alderaan Enclave]] on the [[planet]] [[Sullust]], who bought up land to build an exclusive enclave using proceeds generated from smuggling. Following the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]], Covis was manning the security monitor when a member of the Enclave reported a security breach in auxiliary hatch three. When Astane suggested they ignore the alarm because it could be a distraction, the third [[Alderaanian]] pointed out that one of the intruders was [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], the heir to Alderaan's [[throne]]. Astane dispatched a [[rifle]] [[squad]] who brought the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|rebels]] Organa, [[R2-D2]], and the [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] to the Alderaan Encalve's command hub.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\nWhen Organa tried to convince Astane of her sincere intentions to gather the survivors of Alderaan, Astane instructed Covis to take R2's data and mine every scrap of data from Organa's [[Starship|ship]] ''[[Lord Junn]]'' including [[Gender|her]] weapons profile, navigation history, and transmissions. While Astane took her guests on a tour of the [[Eyewell]], Covis discovered that one of Organa's passengers [[Tace]] had been corresponding with her sister [[Tula]], who was stationed aboard an [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial cruiser]]. Believing that Organa and Verlaine were traitors, Astane ordered her followers to [[Death|kill]] them but the rebels escape down a hatch which led to a den inhabited by [[rockrender]]s.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\nShortly later, the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Commander]] [[Dreed]] dispatched a [[platoon]] of [[stormtrooper]]s which invaded the Alderaan Enclave. With R2's help, Organa and Verlaine managed to unleash a pack of rockrenders on the stormtroopers, which chomped on their mineral rich [[Stormtrooper armor|armor]]. Out of gratitude, Astane convinced her followers including Covis to bow before their [[Queen]].<ref name=\"Leia 3\" />\n\n===Serving Princess Leia===\n{{Quote|The gall of that woman. Painting me as the criminal. Covis, you're my witness.''\"<br>\"''You've been bowing and scrapping to \"that woman\" all week. Make up your mind.|Jora and Covis discussing their dissatisfaction with Leia's leadership|Princess Leia 4}}\nAfter boarding the ''Lord Junn'', Covis and Astane tracked down the alleged [[spy]] Tace and brought her in chains before Organa. While Astane was convinced of her guilt, Organa ordered them to leave while she questioned Tace in order to ascertain her guilt or innocence. In private, Astane complained that Organa was painting her as a criminal. Vouching as a witness, Covis opined that Astane had been bowing and scraping to that woman all [[Standard week|\"week\"]] and urged her to make up her mind.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nIn Covis and Astane's absence, Organa ascertained Tace was innocent and instead identified her sister Tula as the Imperial [[spy]]. When Tace blew Tula's cover, Dreed threatened to execute her unless Organa surrendered herself into Imperial custody. Prior to Organa's trip to the [[desert]] planet [[Skaradosh]], Covis questioned Organa about her plan but Organa refused to budge from her plan and asked if he was coming alone with her. When Covis heard Organa telling R2 that she would see him on the \"other side\", Covis and another follower assumed that Organa was going to die while his companion quipped she was going to droid heaven.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nDuring the flight to Skaradosh, Covis and his co-pilot flew while Organa told a tearful Tace via [[computer]] to find the strength and purpose to live without her. When Covis chuckled, Organa noticed and Covis issued an apology. When Organa asked Covis about the racket, he explained that [[Dreed's Star Destroyer]] was using its [[sensor]]s on them. On Skaradosh, Covis and his companion accompanied Organa when she met with Dreed to facilitate the exchange. In return for Organa surrendering herself, Tula was set free. Covis and his companion then led Tula to their [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|T-1 shuttle]].<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nHowever, Organa's \"surrender\" was actually a ruse. Verlaine arrived in the ''[[Mellcrawler]]'' and attacked Dreed and his men, killing the Imperial commander. Covis along with Organa, Tula, and his companion then escaped aboard the ''Mellcrawler'' where they were joined by R2 and the [[Sullustan]] [[Nien Nunb]]. The group managed to escape the Empire by launching a decoy ship. Covis and the others then traveled to [[Espirion]] where they joined an Alderaanian [[refugee]] [[Alderaan Flotilla|armada]]. Though Dreed's second-in-command [[Venk]] attacked the refugee [[flotilla]], the Alderaanians were saved by the intervention of [[Chief]] [[Beon Beonel]], the leader of the [[Alder-Espirion]] who dispatched the [[warship]] ''[[Espirion Multi]]''.<ref name=\"Leia 5\">[[Princess Leia 5|''Princess Leia'' 5]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Your highness, are you sure you want to go through&mdash;''\"<br>\"''Mr. Covis, I'm not going to keep explaining myself to everyone. If you're with me, come along. If not&mdash;''\"<br>\"''Yes, Ma'am. Sorry, Ma'am.|Mr Covis was a dissenting but ultimately loyal subject of Princess Leia|Princess Leia 4}}\nCovis was a [[human]] man with dark skin, a [[Color|black]] beard, and a black mustache. He wore brown [[robe]]s and a wide headgear. Covis initially distrusted Organa since he intercepted an Imperial transmission aboard her starship ''Lord Junn''. However, he joined his leader Astane in submitting to Organa after she saved them from an Imperial attack.<ref name=\"Leia 3\" /> Later, Organa's determination not to condemn the alleged spy Tace without ascertaining her innocence led Covis and Astane to question her leadership.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\nCovis was critical of Organa's plan to trade her freedom for the life of the Imperial spy Tula. He believed that she was setting herself up to fail. Despite his skepticism, Covis remained loyal to Organa and accompanied her to the [[prisoner]] exchange, which turned out to be a ruse by Organa to free Tula and escape Dreed's clutches.<ref name=\"Leia 4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCovis first appeared in the [[2015]] [[Star Wars comic books|Marvel Star Wars]] comic series ''[[Star Wars: Princess Leia]]''. He was written by [[Mark Waid]], illustrated by [[Terry Dodson]], inked by [[Rachel Dodson]], and colored by [[Jordie Bellaire]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]]\n*[[Princess Leia 5|''Princess Leia'' 5]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30b3\u30fc\u30f4\u30a3\u30b9\uff08\u30aa\u30eb\u30c7\u30e9\u30cb\u30a2\u30f3\uff09\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
