We're a democracy. The people have decided&hellip;|Governor Sio Bibble|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\n'''Sio Bibble''' was the [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Governor of Naboo|governor]] of [[Naboo]] and a member of the [[Naboo Royal Advisory Council|Royal Advisory Council]] during the final [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] and the early days of the [[Galactic Empire]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\nSio Bibble was born on Naboo prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]].<ref name=\"DBSioBibble\" /> Bibble was elected as the governor of Naboo during King Veruna's reign.<ref name=\"ECUC\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> During Queen Amidala's coronation, he and the [[Naboo Royal Advisory Council]] closed the Palace Plaza for a parade.<ref name=\"SWP\">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref>\n\n===Invasion of Naboo===\nIn [[32 BBY]], [[Senator]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] contacted the Royal Advisory Council only to lose communication. Bibble was one of the first to suspect there would be an invasion. However, [[Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala|Amidala]] refused to condone any action that would lead them to war. Later, Bibble's suspicions proved correct when Naboo was invaded by the [[Trade Federation]]. Bibble was arrested along with other people on Naboo at that time. Then, [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] came to rescue them. Queen Amidala (really her decoy [[Sab\u00e9]]) agreed that she should plea to the Senate. Bibble was on high hopes that Senator Palpatine might help them.<ref name=\"DBSioBibble\" /> However, Bibble decided to stay behind to protect his people. Later, Queen Amidala did free Naboo. Bibble attended Jinn's funeral, who was killed in the battle that liberated Naboo. Then, he attended the celebration of Naboo's victory, handing the [[Globe of Peace]] to Boss [[Rugor Nass]].<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n===The Separatist Crisis===\nBibble continued to serve as governor under Amidala's [[Monarch of Naboo|successor]], Queen [[R\u00e9illata]].<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\">''[[Queen's Shadow]]''</ref> In [[22 BBY]], he attended a Council meeting. They talked about how the [[Separatist Crisis]] might become a war and then redirected the conversation to Senator Amidala, who was in danger of being killed and had to hide on Naboo with a bodyguard, [[Anakin Skywalker]].<ref name=\"Episode II\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>\n\n===The Clone Wars===\nQueen [[Jamillia]] was succeeded by Queen [[Neeyutnee]] by [[21 BBY]], whom Bibble also served.<ref name=\"Blue Shadow Virus\">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)|Blue Shadow Virus}}</ref>\n\nIn [[20 BBY]], he greeted Palpatine upon his return to Naboo and attended the [[Festival of Light]]. That night, [[bounty hunter]]s tried to kidnap Palpatine, but their plans were thwarted by Kenobi (who was disguised as [[Rako Hardeen]] at that time). The next morning, Bibble was put in a protection group along with Queen Neeyutnee and Senator Amidala.<ref name=\"Crisis on Naboo\">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>\n\n====Mission to Bardotta====\nIn [[19 BBY]], Bibble went with Senator Amidala to the Galactic Senate when Queen [[Julia]] of [[Bardotta]] contacted the Republic. Palpatine presented the queen the people he chose to go to Bardotta: Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] and Senator Amidala of Naboo. However, the queen specifically said she wanted [[Junior Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks]] of Naboo to go, puzzling everyone.<ref name=\"The Disappeared 1\">{{TCW|The Disappeared, Part I}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial Era===\nSio Bibble attended the [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala's funeral|funeral of Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] shortly after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"Episode III\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Around that time, he chose to retire as governor. However, instead of an election being held, in which former [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|Royal Handmaiden]] [[Sach\u00e9]] was heavily favored to win, the Empire replaced the position with that of Imperial [[governor]], and appointed [[Quarsh Panaka]] to the position.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I guess there's a reason Bibble keeps getting elected.|[[Rab\u00e9]]|Queen's Peril}}\nSio Bibble was a dedicated public servant who served as governor. He did not always agree with Queen Amidala, but he supported her and deferred to her judgement. He admired Amidala's lofty goals but did not always share her optimism. He had influence among her other advisers.<ref name=\"Queen's Peril\">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref>\n\nBibble was a brave and defiant man in the face of great danger, like he demonstrated when [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] from the Trade Federation invaded [[Theed]].<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Bibble was also known to speak his mind on several important matters like the Separatist Crisis or Gunray's constant trials in the Supreme Courts of the Galactic Republic for his actions.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />More than anything,  Bibble cared to an extent for the safety of Queen Amidala as demonstrated during the Trade Federation's invasion of Theed.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Sio_Bibble_concept.jpg|thumb|right|Concept art of Sio Bibble by [[Iain McCaig]].]]\nSio Bibble was played by [[Oliver Ford Davies]] in the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']].<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Davies then reprised the role again in [[2002]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> and [[2005]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nConcept art for Sio Bibble was developed by [[Iain McCaig]].<ref name=\"DBSioBibble\" /> For Bibble's name, however, it was [[Katie Lucas]], daughter of director [[George Lucas]], the one who came up with the name.<ref name=\"KLTweet1\">{{Twitter|KRLgrrl|statuses/52816495872442368|[[Katie Lucas]]|nobackup=1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the principal photography of ''Attack of the Clones'' in [[Wikipedia:Italy|Italy]], Davies was unable to attend, as he was shooting another film and was in a play.
