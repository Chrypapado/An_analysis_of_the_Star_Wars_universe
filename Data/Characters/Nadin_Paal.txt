Paal was appointed as Nirama's \"trade envoy\" to the [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] government, ensuring that the organization remained safe from sanctions and judicial review.<ref name=\"TCSWE\" /> Aside from his work as spokesperson Paal earned [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] as a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], piloting his modified [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300]] called the ''[[Whirling Stars]]''.\n\nWhile under Nirama's employ, Lieutenant Paal earned the ire of [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], who placed a large [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] on his head with the condition that it could only be claimed if Paal left the system. The [[Bounty Hunters' Guild/Legends|Bounty Hunters' Guild]] always had somebody watching Paal's movements and thus, even with the Gran knowing that problems were approaching as of [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], he remained in Cularin. The bounty would trap the Gran insystem despite the fact that he wanted to earn a respectable living else where.<ref name=\"LFC\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nCirca [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"20 BBY\">The ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' states that the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|''Living Force'']] campaign is set one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] after the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], an event that is dated to [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]] by ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''. As the ''Living Force'' adventure ''[[Philology]]'' [[Cularin's disappearance|moved]] the campaign forward ten years to the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and the adventure ''[[Night's Homecoming]]'' established that by Year 4 of the campaign over a year had elapsed since the events of ''Philology'', ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' can therefore be dated to circa [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]].</ref> Nadin Paal, second-in-command to Nirama since [[Len Markus]]'s mysterious disappearance, traveled to the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order's]] [[Almas Academy]], to take part in a private ceremony of gratitude towards the [[Heroes of Cularin|heroes]] who defeated the notorious [[Slaver/Legends|slaver]] [[Phylus Mon]].<ref name=\"AMA\">''[[A Mon Alone]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNadin Paal usually came off as a nervous individual, and always seemed to be looking over his shoulder. He did not want anybody to find out about his thoughts of going straight, and would get defensive when his motives were called into question.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Here and Thaere]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Force Convergence]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Recursion]]''\n*''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Rodian]]''\n*''[[A Mon Alone]]''\n*''[[Challenge]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20051215Farewell|text=Farewell|int=Farewell|archivedate=20090603045838}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf20020307bshadows&c=swlfc|text=Life in the Shadows|int=Life in the Shadows|archivedate=20030813173510}} {{Po}}\n*''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''\n*''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|nadinpaal|Paal, Nadin|nobackup=1}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paal, Nadin}}\n[[Category:Cularin Belt residents]]\n[[Category:Diplomats]]\n[[Category:Gran]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
