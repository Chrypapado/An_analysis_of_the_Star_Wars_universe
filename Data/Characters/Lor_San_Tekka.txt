He became a believer in the ideals of the [[Jedi Order]] during the [[Clone Wars]], despite not being [[Force-sensitive]], and followed the underground faith of his church during the [[Imperial Era|dark times]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]'s rule over [[the galaxy]]. San Tekka found [[Jedi]] lore that the Empire attempted to suppress, and his knowledge of the galaxy and its [[Timeline of galactic history|history]] was useful to the [[New Republic]] after it prevailed over the Empire during the [[Battle of Endor]] and began a period of [[Galaxy|galactic]] reconstruction. Lor San Tekka also helped [[Luke Skywalker]], the last known [[Jedi Knight]] at the [[time]], seek out Jedi lore that the Empire had attempted to destroy. At some point, San Tekka lived with the [[Cr\u00e8che]] and learned about their spiritual culture.\n\nAfter Skywalker's new generation of Jedi was [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed]] by his nephew and apprentice, [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]], Skywalker went into exile and sought out the [[first Jedi Temple]] on [[Ahch-To]]. San Tekka, who retired to a [[Tuanul|spiritual village]] on the [[planet]] [[Jakku]], discovered a fragment of [[Map to Skywalker|a map]] that could lead to Ahch-To. He was sought by the [[Resistance]], led by Skywalker's sister, [[General]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], as well as the resurgent Imperial force known as the [[First Order]]. San Tekka gave the map fragment to Resistance [[Commander]] [[Poe Dameron]] and was soon [[Attack on Tuanul|captured]] by Kylo Ren, who demanded to know where the map was. When San Tekka refused to comply, Ren [[Death|killed]] him. San Tekka's sacrifice was not in vain; the map was given to the Resistance, and a young Force-user named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] followed it to Ahch-To and found the exiled [[Jedi Master]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Galactic explorer===\n{{Quote|That's&hellip; That's the explorer.''\"<br />\"''You got it.

He left long ago.|A Cr\u00e8che elder and Poe Dameron, on the whereabouts of Lor San Tekka|Poe Dameron 1}}\nLor San Tekka was [[Reproduction|born]] in the waning [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. As a young [[Gender|man]], he came to have a high regard for the [[Jedi Order]] and knew about the actions of the [[Jedi Knight]]s during the [[Clone Wars]]. After the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] and the [[Great Jedi Purge|destruction]] of the [[Jedi]], San Tekka never believed [[Darth Sidious|the]] [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] when he branded the Jedi traitors. San Tekka was a member of the [[Church of the Force]] during [[Imperial Era|Imperial rule]], following the underground faith that believed in the Jedi ideals despite not being [[Force-sensitive]] himself. He uncovered much of the history of the Jedi Knights that the Empire attempted to bury, leading many individuals to seek him out for his knowledge of Jedi lore.<ref name=\"TFA VD\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_Skywalker_Jedi_Master_VII.jpg|thumb|left|300px|San Tekka had a map that could lead to Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who went into exile after the destruction of his Jedi Order.]]\nSan Tekka was a seasoned traveler and explorer on the remote fringes of [[the galaxy]]. Following the defeat of the Empire at the [[Battle of Endor]], San Tekka aided the fledgling [[New Republic]] by providing [[bureaucrat]]s with information regarding worlds across the [[galaxy]]. This helped the New Republic greatly, as the Empire destroyed many documents that would have been useful for galactic reconstruction.<ref name=\"TFA VD\" />\n\nAs an ally of Jedi Knight [[Luke Skywalker]] and his sister, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], San Tekka helped the last Jedi recover secret Jedi lore that the Empire had tried to erase.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Luke Skywalker made use of the Jedi star compass he had discovered in the Emperor's storehouse on [[Pillio]]. With a plasma-encased [[supraluminite]] [[lodestone]] at its center, the compass functioned much like the ancient [[wayfinder]]s and was attuned to specific points in [[hyperspace]]. Through studying the compass, he uncovered a path to Ahch-To, the site of Temple island and the first Jedi Temple. With the help of Lor San Tekka, he finally put together the many clues and learned the location of the temple, a discovery that he and San Tekka kept secret. San Tekka also came to know [[Ben Solo]], the son of Organa and the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]].\n\nOn one occasion, Skywalker and the boy accompanied San Tekka on a [[Mission to Elphrona|mission]] to the [[planet]] [[Elphrona]], having received information on an ancient [[Elphrona Outpost|Jedi outpost]]. Amid the ruins, the trio was confronted by the [[Knights of Ren]], who attempted to persuade young Solo to join them, but were ultimately defeated by Luke and fled.<ref name=\"The Rise of Kylo Ren 2\">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 2|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 2]]</ref>\n\nYears later, San Tekka found out that Solo did indeed turn to the [[dark side of the Force]] and joined the Knights, becoming Kylo Ren after the [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destruction]] of Skywalker's new generation of Jedi. Skywalker vanished into [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] after his Jedi were destroyed and went to the [[first Jedi Temple]]<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> on the planet [[Ahch-To]].<ref name=\"Junior Novelization\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> San Tekka, who discovered with Luke years ago the first Jedi Temple, owned a partial [[Map to Skywalker|map]] that revealed the location of the [[Jedi Master]].<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nAt some point, San Tekka lived with the [[Cr\u00e8che]] on [[Ovanis]], where they guarded a [[Cr\u00e8che egg|sacred egg]] that they believed would hatch a savior who would bring salvation to the galaxy. San Tekka lived there for two years to learn about the Cr\u00e8che, who were a very protective people. He gained their trust because of how much [[time]] he spent there learning their ways, and they referred to him as \"the explorer.\"<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 1\">[[Poe Dameron 1|''Poe Dameron'' 1]]</ref>\n\n===The map to Luke Skywalker===\nThe [[Resistance]], a military force led by now-[[General]] Organa, and the [[First Order]], a resurgent Imperial force led by the mysterious [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]], both learned that San Tekka had the map to Skywalker in his possession.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Hoping that her brother could help defeat the First Order, Organa sent [[Commander]] [[Poe Dameron]], a [[pilot]] in the Resistance, to [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|search for San Tekka]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 1\" />\n\nFollowing San Tekka's trail, Poe and [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]] traveled to Ovanis. There, Dameron met with the Cr\u00e8che, whom the explorer had met a long time ago.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 1\" /> Dameron was followed by the First Order [[Agent]] [[Terex]],<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 2\">[[Poe Dameron 2|''Poe Dameron'' 2]]</ref> who had learned of his presence through a [[spy]].<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 6\">[[Poe Dameron 6|''Poe Dameron'' 6]]</ref> After the [[Mission to Ovanis|skirmish]] on Ovanis, [[Color|Black]] [[Squadron]] [[Mission to Megalox Beta|traveled]] to the [[prison]] world of [[Megalox Beta]] to question [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the [[Hutt]] about his encounter with San Tekka.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 4\">[[Poe Dameron 4|''Poe Dameron'' 4]]</ref> Despite facing opposition from Terex, Black Squadron managed to rescue Grakkus, who gave him information on the places that San Tekka had visited.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 6\" />\n\n===Captured on Cato Neimoidia===\n[[File:Lor_San_Tekka_imprisoned.png|thumb|right|250px|Lor San Tekka imprisoned on Cato Neimoidia]]\nLater, San Tekka traveled to [[Cato Neimoidia]], where he disguised himself and went on a guided tour in the [[Great Vaults of Cato Neimoidia|Palace of]] [[Baron]] [[Paw Maccon]]. He broke off from the group and headed into the vaults. Using a special [[cloak]] he managed to walk through [[laser]] barriers and enter one of the vaults with a [[gold]]en box inside. San Tekka opened it and found an [[Kazerath|ancient object]] crafted by using both the [[Light side of the Force|light side]] and dark side of [[the Force]]. His break-in hadn't gone unnoticed, though, and [[Neimoidian guard|guards]] appeared, arresting San Tekka.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 20\">[[Poe Dameron 20|''Poe Dameron'' 20]]</ref>\n\nHe was put in golden chains inside a prison cell. San Tekka claimed that they had no right to hold him and that he had only looked at the object, never intending to steal it. His pleas were ignored by Maccon but at the very same time, a [[Leia Organa's ship|significant ship]] landed at Baron [[Reya]]'s platform. Maccon asked furiously what tricks Reya has used to get such a significant client. When the occupant took a few steps out of the [[Starship|ship]], Maccon didn't recognize her but San Tekka informed him that it was Leia Organa.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 21\">[[Poe Dameron 21|''Poe Dameron'' 21]]</ref>\n\nDuring his trial, San Tekka explained to Maccon why he had acted as he did, but Maccon didn't listen and instead stated that San Tekka would be [[Death|executed]]. He was shocked but he was taken away.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 21\" />\n\nWhen San Tekka was in his cell, Dameron suddenly broke in. He had hidden in Organa's [[Clothing|gowns]] which she wanted to store in Maccon's vaults. It was all a [[Mission to Cato Neimoidia (Resistance)|big plan]] to save San Tekka. They both hid inside the same gowns, which were now being taken back to Organa's ship due to her not feeling her gowns were safe. Dameron then got out to help Black Squadron in the sky, fighting old [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|vulture droids]]. Unknown to them, Commander [[Malarus]] and Terex had snuck aboard the ship and now took off with San Tekka on board.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 22\">[[Poe Dameron 22|''Poe Dameron'' 22]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lor_San_Tekka_and_Leia.png|thumb|left|280px|Lor San Tekka and Leia on D'Qar]]\nMalarus left the ship to engage in the dogfight in the sky while leaving Terex in charge of the ship. Terex left Cato Neimoidia and headed off into [[hyperspace]] with San Tekka on board. Terex then opened the door to Organa's gowns and let the old man out. San Tekka, not knowing who Terex was, asked if he was in Dameron's company. Terex answered that he knew him all too well. When Terex was charging an [[Z6 riot control baton]] into his own head, San Tekka suggested that it might be dangerous to the First Order agent. Terex then called [[Captain]] [[Phasma]], offering her San Tekka in exchange removing the implants on his head.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 23\">[[Poe Dameron 23|''Poe Dameron'' 23]]</ref>\n\nTerex got rid of Organa's gowns, flushing them out in hyperspace, believing that they might host explosives, [[poison]] or trackers. When Terex continued to charge the [[baton]] into his head, San Tekka advised him to stop or otherwise he would die. They shared a friendly conversation, and Terex said that he liked San Tekka and that it would almost be a pity to give him to the First Order. When Terex showed up to Phasma he didn't have San Tekka with him, saying that he would not give her the old man until the First Order removed his implants. When he had gotten his implants removed he headed off into [[Realspace|space]], giving the First Order the location of San Tekka. At the same time, however, he also called the Resistance and gave them the location of San Tekka, since he didn't care whether the First Order or the Resistance got to San Tekka first, and either scenario would be a win for him. He then sent [[Galactic coordinates|coordinates]] revealing that San Tekka was floating around in a [[EVA suit|spacesuit]]<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 24\">[[Poe Dameron 24|''Poe Dameron'' 24]]</ref> in the [[Great Forveen Nebula]]. [[Rescue of Lor San Tekka|He was rescued]] by Black Squadron, who brought him to their secret [[Resistance base|base]] on [[D'Qar]]. San Tekka told Leia that although he didn't know where Skywalker was, he had his suspicions, and asked for a starship so he could investigate a bit. Once he had Skywalker's location, San Tekka would send word of where they could meet up with him and get the information.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 25\">[[Poe Dameron 25|''Poe Dameron'' 25]]</ref> Shortly after San Tekka's departure, Organa reunited with Dameron, informing him of his mission and that San Tekka had the map to her brother. She told him that San Tekka and the map were on [[Jakku]], remarking that the Empire [[Battle of Jakku|had ended]] there and now the end of the First Order would come from the same place.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 26\">[[Poe Dameron 26|''Poe Dameron'' 26]]</ref>\n\n===Death on Jakku===\n{{Quote|You know what I've come for.''\"<br />\"''I know where you come from, before you called yourself Kylo Ren.|Kylo Ren and Lor San Tekka|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\n[[File:Kylo_and_Lor_San_Tekka.png|thumb|right|300px|San Tekka was brought before Kylo Ren and refused to aid the dark warrior in his search for Skywalker.]]\nWhen Dameron arrived on Jakku, he met with San Tekka at a [[Tuanul|village]]. Knowing that the return of the Jedi was essential for the balance of the Force, San Tekka gave the map to Dameron just before the First Order arrived. Dameron fled as Ren arrived with his [[First Order military|forces]] and [[Attack on Tuanul|assaulted]] the village, during which San Tekka was captured by [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] and brought before Ren. The dark warrior demanded the map to Skywalker while San Tekka lamented what the young man had become. When San Tekka did not comply and alluded to Ren's heritage as [[Skywalker family|a Skywalker]], Ren, while sarcastically agreeing with San Tekka's claim that the dark knight couldn't escape the truth regarding his family, killed him with [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|his lightsaber]] and ordered the destruction of the [[Sacred Villages|village]].<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nThe map that San Tekka gave his life to protect ultimately made its way to the Resistance.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Dameron, who managed to escape from Jakku, reported to Organa, telling her that he lost the map and that San Tekka was killed, but Organa assured him that [[BB-8]] was at [[Takodana]], leading them to [[Battle of Takodana|go there]] and rescue the droid.<ref name=\"Poe Dameron 26\" /> Later, [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], a young Force user who had also hailed from Jakku and helped bring the map to the Resistance, was sent by Organa to Ahch-To. There, she discovered the exiled [[Jedi Master]] and offered him the [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]] that had once belonged to him and [[Anakin Skywalker|his father]], a sign of the only hope that the galaxy had left.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|This will begin to make things right.|Lor San Tekka, as he handed the map to Luke Skywalker to Poe Dameron|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}\n[[File:LorSanTekkaGivesPoeMap.png|thumb|left|300px|San Tekka believed in the ideals of the Jedi and gave Poe Dameron the map to Luke Skywalker in the hopes of saving the galaxy.]]\nLor San Tekka was a [[human]] male. He stood at 1.85 [[meter]]s<ref name=\"Databank\" /> and had white [[hair]], blue [[eye]]s, and light skin.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> A seasoned explorer, San Tekka had knowledge and wisdom from across the galaxy, including the hidden lore of the Jedi Order that the Galactic Empire tried to suppress in the wake of the Clone Wars. San Tekka was a member of the Church of the Force and a believer in the ideals of the Jedi Knights.<ref name=\"TFA VD\" /> He believed that the Jedi were essential to the balance of the Force and helped the Resistance find the vanished Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, unable to stand idly by as despair and darkness grew in the galaxy.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nSan Tekka traveled lightly in his later years and showed wisdom with the few artifacts he continued to carry from place to place. He often wore a homespun [[fantabu]]-wool coat, along with a [[tuanulberry]]-dyed linen tunic and [[gundark]]-hide survival [[belt]]. Around his neck he wore what was dubbed the [[Chain of Wisdom]], while his most cherished artifact was the antiquated data storage unit in a plain leather sack that held the map to Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"TFA VD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLor San Tekka is a character created for the [[2015]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], directed by [[J.J.

The character was portrayed by [[Max von Sydow]].<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\n[[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] [[Lucasfilm Story Group|Story Group]] member and author of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]'', [[Pablo Hidalgo]], revealed in an interview that they were considering making San Tekka a priest in the Church of the Force. He also revealed that the Church was originally conceived by [[George Lucas]] for a [[Star Wars: Underworld|''Star Wars'' live-action TV series]]. It was held behind the scenes before the backstory was added to ''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens''.<ref name=\"SWBW 53\">[http://www.starwarsreport.com/2016/02/19/pablo-hidalgo-interview-swbw-53/ Star Wars Bookworms Podcast 53]: Interview with Pablo Hidalgo</ref>\n\nSan Tekka was also featured in the [[2016]] [[video game]] ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''. His role in the game is largely the same as in the film, but instead of Ren killing him with his lightsaber, Ren's lightsaber malfunctions and San Tekka laughs at him, causing the enraged Ren to launch him into space. The next level shows that San Tekka is still alive floating in space. The game also features a bonus mission titled \"Lor San Tekka's Return,\" which details San Tekka's arrival on Jakku shortly before the meeting with Dameron. The level portrays San Tekka as a close friend of bounty hunter [[Athgar Heece]], who first helps him get to the Tuanul village but is then implied to be the one to betray San Tekka's location to the First Order.<ref name=\"LEGO TFA\">''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''</ref>\n\nThe announcement of the postponement of the ''[[Star Wars: The High Republic]]'' multimedia project included a mention of a [[San Tekka clan]].<ref name=\"THR delay\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-high-republic-sees-revised-release-dates|text=''Star Wars: The High Republic'' Sees Revised Release Dates}}</ref> Author Charles Soule later affirmed the connection between the clan and the character, although this has yet to be revealed in official story materials.<ref name=\"Polygon LOTJ\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/star-wars/2021/1/12/22221112/light-of-the-jedi-spoilers-author-charles-soule-interview|title=Light of the Jedi author Charles Soule can finally talk about Light of the Jedi|author=Patches, Matt|date=2021-01-12|work=[[Wikipedia:Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Wikipedia:Vox Media|Vox Media]]|archivedate=20210113190455}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 2|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 2]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Before the Awakening]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 1|''Poe Dameron'' 1]] {{Hologram}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 2|''Poe Dameron'' 2]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 3|''Poe Dameron'' 3]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 4|''Poe Dameron'' 4]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 5|''Poe Dameron'' 5]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 6|''Poe Dameron'' 6]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 8|''Poe Dameron'' 8]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 9|''Poe Dameron'' 9]] {{C|Mentioned only in opening crawl}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 11|''Poe Dameron'' 11]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 14|''Poe Dameron'' 14]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 20|''Poe Dameron'' 20]]\n*[[Poe Dameron 21|''Poe Dameron'' 21]]\n*[[Poe Dameron 22|''Poe Dameron'' 22]]\n*[[Poe Dameron 23|''Poe Dameron'' 23]]\n*[[Poe Dameron 24|''Poe Dameron'' 24]]\n*[[Poe Dameron 25|''Poe Dameron'' 25]]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] {{1st}}\n*{{Galaxy of Adventures|Leia Organa - A Princess, A General, A Mentor}} {{Voice}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (audiobook)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel (audiobook)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Force Awakens Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''\n*[[The Force Awakens (Golden Book)|''The Force Awakens'' Golden Book]]\n*''[[Finn & the First Order]]''\n*''[[Finn and Poe Team Up!]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Graphic Novel Adaptation]]''\n*[[The Force Awakens Adaptation 1|''The Force Awakens Adaptation'' 1]] {{Corpse}}\n*[[Poe Dameron 26|''Poe Dameron'' 26]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire (audiobook)|''Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n}}\n===Non-canon appearances===\n*''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n*''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga]]''\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: New Adventures]]''\n*{{LEGOCite|tfa|75149|Resistance X-Wing Fighter}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-the-seventh-seal|text=The Seventh Seal &ndash;
