Perpetually in the company of his master, Oolth was attendant, taking notes, as Black Sun enforcer [[Asa Naga]] recounted [[Darth Maul/Legends|Darth Maul's]] attack on [[Vigo/Legends|Vigo]] [[Darnada]]'s [[Deep Space Demolition and Removal|station]] to the assembled remaining Vigos. As Darth Maul commenced his [[First Mission to Ralltiir|assault]] on the [[Black Sun Fortress|fortress]], Oolth accompanied his master and his [[Mighella|bodyguard]] from the citadel to escape to [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], leaving the remaining Vigos and guards behind to stall Maul. However, before the [[Alexi Garyn's yacht|executive yacht]] could be reached, Maul caught up and [[Death/Legends|slew]] both Garyn and his bodyguard. Oolth slunk away silently to hide and was ignored by Maul, whose primary target was Garyn. He was the only known individual to survive the massacre on [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]].\n\n===Death on Coruscant===\nAfterward, Oolth attempted to hide on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and inform the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] about the existence of Darth Maul. Jedi [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Darsha Assant]] was ordered to find and escort him to the [[Jedi Temple]], intended as a [[Jedi Trials/Legends|trial]] in her quest for Knighthood. Though Oolth was located, hiding out in the undercity, the two were attacked by a gang known as the [[Raptors (gang)|Raptors]] before they could reach Darsha's [[Skyhopper/Legends|skyhopper]]. In an attempt to escape, Assant activated her elevation belt and, for a moment, the pair evaded danger and approached the safety of the upper levels. Unavailingly, they were then assailed by [[Hawk-bat/Legends|hawk-bats]], which gouged out Oolth's right eye. He tried to defend himself only to lose his grip and fall into the abyss of the undercity. He was presumed dead and, when Assant and her master returned to the scene, his body had disappeared, already scavenged by the hunters that roamed Coruscant's lower levels.\n\n==Equipment==\nOolth was constantly shadowed by a small hovering droid, presumably an assistant in the mechanical aspects of his position as secretary.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThough a useful and intelligent secretary, Oolth was notably a coward, abandoning even his master when he saw Garyn's bodyguard slain. Like many Fondorians, he saw himself as a superior organism in all ways and showed no compassion for other beings, especially the indigent. He showed little thanks even when rescued from mortal peril and seemed logically concerned only with his survival with the littlest possible effort on his own part.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Darth Maul (2000) 3|''Darth Maul'' (2000) 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Darth Maul (2000) 4|''Darth Maul'' (2000) 4]]\n*''[[Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Oolth\n|es=Oolth\n|fi=Oolth\n|hu=Oolth\n|nl=Oolth\n|pl=Oolth\n|ru=\u0423\u043b\u0442\n}}\n\n[[Category:Black Sun members]]\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Fondorians]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
