Perhaps you're the exact individual we need to help us. We'll find out soon enough.|Kallaarac|Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees}}\n'''Kallaarac''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who served as the [[Chief/Legends|chieftain]] of the [[Myyydril]] tribe, a group of beings who lived in the [[Myyydril Caverns]] in the [[Kkowir Forest]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. Sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] visited the tribe, hoping to help them with their problems and gain their trust. Kallaarac instructed the visitor to seek out the members of his tribe within the caverns to see if they needed any help. When the spacer returned to Kallaarac after gaining the tribe's confidence, the chieftain charged the outsider with ending an infestation of [[Urnsor'is]] [[Spider/Legends|spiders]] within the caverns. Kallaarac tasked the spacer with several duties to achieve this, the last of which was to exterminate the infestation's source, a ferocious Urnsor'is known as the [[Mother Queen]]. When the visitor returned to Kallaraac victorious, the chief was overjoyed and rewarded the spacer for the deed.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|I have heard about the great many accomplishments you are contributing to our village. You are an honorable addition to our community.|Kallaarac|Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees}}\nA [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Kallaarac was a member of the [[Myyydril]], a tribe that consisted of various [[Species/Legends|species]] who lived together within the [[Myyydril Caverns]] in the [[Kkowir Forest]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. Kallaarac and the Myyydril tribe had long suffered from attacks and disease caused by the [[Urnsor'is]], a ferocious [[Parasite/Legends|parasitic]] [[Spider/Legends|spider]] species that had infested the caverns.<ref name=\"SWG\" /> During the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] leading up to the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], he discovered [[Nak'tra crystal]]s were an effective weapon against the Urnsor'is parasites. At the height of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], he was named the [[Chief/Legends|chieftain]] of his [[City/Legends|village]].<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|195|Kallaarac}}</ref> At some point after sustaining an injury in an Urnsor'is attack, Kallaarac replaced his entire left [[Limb/Legends|arm]] with a [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] one.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nAt some point after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Kallaarac and the Myydril tribe were visited by a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who wished to assist them in their plight. The visitor spoke with Kallaarac, who was initially skeptical of the outsider's motives, but the Wookiee chief offered to let the fellow [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] demonstrate friendly intentions. The chief instructed the spacer to seek out the people of his tribe within the caverns and assist them first, stating that if the stranger did this, it would prove to the Wookiee that further trust was warranted. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], the spacer assisted the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Tala'oree]] in thinning the amount of [[uwari beetle]]s near the entrance of the caverns, helped the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Kirrir]] gather [[warrl]] [[Plant/Legends|leaves]] for her [[Warrl Surprise]] beverage, and retrieved the Wookiee [[Nawika]]'s jewelry box from deep within the cave.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nThe spacer returned to Kallaarac after completing these duties and wondered if the actions had earned the tribe's and the chieftain's trust. Kallaarac declared that the outsider had indeed proved worthy and named the individual a member of the tribe. The Wookiee further entrusted the newcomer with a true test of loyalty and nobility: the utter destruction of the Urnsor'is infestation within the caverns. The chieftain first tasked the spacer with thinning the Urnsor'is by killing fifteen of the creatures that had amassed near the tribe's compound. The visitor returned successful, and Kallaarac offered another mission: to strike at the Urnsor'is nests, collect twenty of their [[Egg/Legends|eggs]], and return with them, a task that the spacer was successful in doing. Kallaarac's final strike against the Urnsor'is was to send the newcomer to destroy the infestation's source, the ferocious [[Mother Queen]]. After doing battle with the [[Queen/Legends|queen]] and her guard, the spacer finally slew the beast and returned to Kallaarac a hero. The grateful chieftain rewarded the spacer with {{Cr}}7,000 and a unique, one-handed [[Sword/Legends|sword]] known as the [[Urnsor'is SoulLeecher]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|I care very strongly for my people. Therefore, my problems and issues come second.|Kallaarac|Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees}}\nKallaarac cared deeply for his people and considered the problems of the Myyydril tribe before his own needs. He was very reluctant to ask for help from people in whom he did not have confidence or who did not have the confidence of the tribe. Kallaarac's people respected him immensely and considered him a great leader and a very noble being. He had dark [[brown]] fur and, like the majority of his species, spoke only the [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]] [[Language/Legends|language]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKallaarac is a non-playable character who appears in [[Star Wars Galaxies: Rage of the Wookiees|''Rage of the Wookiees'']], the [[2005]] expansion pack for ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]].
