Her name was ahh... Syndil, maybe. Anyway she has her own problem she would like help with, and will be contacting you soon.|[[Watto/Legends|Watto]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Syndil Na'Marr''' was a [[Gender/Legends|woman]] who resided on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].<ref name=\"SWG:LW\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Syndil Na'Marr bought the legs from a [[R2-series astromech droid|R2 unit]] to the [[Junk dealer/Legends|junk dealer]] [[Watto/Legends|Watto]]. However, the droid was wanted by both [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Arlan Barrezz|Barrezz]] and [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Carh'la Bastra|Bastra]] and an Imperial Captain soon confiscated the legs. One of Syndil's friend, a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] pilot, later went after the Imperial Captain and managed to ambush and destroy the Captain's [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]] in the [[Mospic High Range/Legends|Mospic High Range]]. However, the pilot was downed and unable to contact Syndil Na'Marr. When a spacer looking for the droid legs approached Syndil, she agreed to give them if the spacer was able to rescue her missing pilot friend. The spacer thus went to the mountains, found the downed pilot and finally recovered the droid legs from hostile [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] in the area.<ref name=\"SWG:LW\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSyndil Na'Marr was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:LW\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Syndil Na'Marr was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Legacy Quest|Legacy Quest]]\" with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n*{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=All%20Roads%20Lead%20to%20Jabba&resource=features|text=All Roads Lead to Jabba|archivedate=20060213090006}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Champions_of_the_Force#Card_gallery|cardname=Leg Work}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Leg Work}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Na'Marr, Syndil}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
