Born '''Valin Halcyon''', the secret son of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Nejaa Halcyon]], he was apprenticed to his father, who died shortly after the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. When the Jedi Purge began, Nejaa's former Corellian Security partner and best friend, [[Rostek Horn]], married [[Scerra Horn|Scerra Halcyon]] and adopted young Valin, whose name became '''Valin Horn''', though he went almost exclusively by the name \"Hal Horn\", a sly reference to ''Halcyon''. Rostek hid all evidence of the family's [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] past, and Horn went on to marry [[Nyche Horn]] and father a son, [[Corran Horn|Corran]].\n\nHorn became a CorSec officer just like his adoptive father, and excelled in the position. He quickly became an [[Inspector/Legends|Inspector]], and his tenacity and investigative skill became legendary. He developed a longstanding rivalry with [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Booster Terrik]], eventually catching him, and with [[Moranda Savich]], the pursuit of whom got Horn into a sticky situation on [[Darkknell/Legends|Darkknell]]. In [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], Horn was joined by his son Corran in CorSec, but lost his wife to a [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] accident.\n\nLater that year, Horn and his son successfully [[Capture of Zekka Thyne|captured]] [[Zekka Thyne]], the head of [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Horn was killed by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]]. Corran strongly suspected that he had been deliberately [[Assassin/Legends|assassinated]], but could never identify who had ordered it.

He was hot on the tail of the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] criminal, freezing his bank account, but Idanian disappeared on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and never resurfaced. Horn never learned that Idanian was actually [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /><ref name=\"I, Jedi\" /> In that same year, Horn received a report of an attempted rape from a young transport pilot named [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]]. A group of youths, including [[Ilir Post]], had attempted to rape a girl named [[Pamr]] on an [[agro-combine]] run by [[Allied Grain and Roughage]] during the [[Harvest Festival]]. Fel had fought the three assailants off, but as they were the children of management figures, the local police, in AGR's pocket, refused to prosecute. Fel came to Horn and Corellian Security, and Horn took Fel's statement and prepared an investigation of Post and the others. However, on his return to the agro-combine, Fel was given an appointment to the [[Academy of Carida]] by [[Ivr Drop]] and told that his family would be taken care of if he would go. If he did not accept it, the company would make it hard on Fel's family, who all worked for the corporation. Feeling he had no choice, Fel accepted the appointment and left for [[Carida/Legends|Carida]]. Without Fel to testify, Horn's case fell apart. He understood the situation Fel was in, however, and met him as he left, encouraging the young man to make the most of the opportunity and not put his family in danger. Horn would be keeping close watch on Post, and was confident he would slip up again and be caught.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" /> Post did eventually misstep once more, and was sent to the [[Prison/Legends|prison]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]].<ref name=\"Family Ties\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]], Horn was assigned to the case of the [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] who destroyed the [[Gus Treta Inner-System Market Station|Gus Treta]] [[Fuel/Legends|fueling]] station owned by [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles's]] parents. Though he devoted himself to the investigation, he could not find the pirates. Even so, he kept an eye on young Antilles, who was left orphaned by the accident. When Antilles began [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] weapons for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], Horn pronounced Antilles a lost cause.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron \" /> Horn pursued the infamous smuggler [[Booster Terrik]] for a considerable period of time, with Terrik frequently eluding him.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\">''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''</ref> Horn caught him once, but he later went free, only to be pursued again by Horn.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" /> The two became tremendous rivals. Eventually, in [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], he was able to arrest Terrik on smuggling charges and sent him to Kessel for five years.<ref name=\"The Bacta War\" /><ref name=\"The New Essential Guide to Characters\" />\n\nHorn encouraged his son to follow his hunches and senses of unease. He had a very good relationship with Corran, serving as his son's friend as well as his father, and the pair made an excellent team. Corran felt comfortable taking his problems to Horn and discussing them, and always looked to his father for moral guidance.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /><ref name=\"The Bacta War\" /> Horn, in return, was extremely proud of his son and confident in his ability to make good choices. Around 2 BBY, he recorded a [[Hologram/Legends|holographic]] message for Corran telling him about his Jedi heritage, in the event that he himself died before it was safe for Corran to learn of it. He told his son how proud he was of him, and of his hope that Corran would continue the family's Jedi heritage. Horn hoped that eventually he would be able to train his son as a Jedi himself.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" />\n\n===The hunt for Moranda Savich===\n{{Quote|Strange as it may seem, Garm, over the past few years I've gotten sort of used to having Horn on my tail. He's a pretty good opponent, you know, well worth matching wits against. I rather enjoy that sort of challenge. Besides, I know that if he's the one who brings the hammer down on me, I'll be treated fairly.

He had pursued her for a few years, and followed her trail from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] to [[Kreeling/Legends|Kreeling]], [[Dorsis]], and [[Mantarran]] before ending up on the distant [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] world [[Darkknell/Legends|Darkknell]]. As he technically had no jurisdiction there and was obliged to rely on local authorities' cooperation, he had to surrender his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] when he touched down in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Xakrea]]. The [[Darkknell Defense Agency]], however, was far more concerned with a recent alert that an important Rebel was present on Darkknell and had to be detained, and offered no real assistance to Horn. Horn traveled to [[Arky's Emporium of Forgotten Treasures]], run by [[Seb Arkos]], a known document forger and a man Horn had once had imprisoned. He asked Arkos about Savich, and after pressuring him the convict revealed that Savich had sought his help in leaving Darkknell and would be coming by the shop soon.<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\">''[[Interlude at Darkknell]]''</ref>\n\nHorn would have waited outside, but a woman arrived claiming to be [[Katya Glasc]], a [[Darkknell Special Security]] agent&mdash;she was actually [[Ysanne Isard]] of [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]]. She told him that he had a break in Savich's case, and took him outside to speak. On leaving, he saw Savich in the street and moved to arrest her, but was held back by Isard as her bodyguard, [[Trabler]], moved to shoot the thief. Realizing that he intended to kill her, Horn used a [[The Force/Legends|Force]] illusion to affect the man's aim and Savich was only shot in the shoulder. Isard made Horn leave Savich, telling him that he was needed in a vital mission to catch a Rebel who had just recently bombed a building in which Corellian [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Garm Bel Iblis]] was about to give a speech. While Horn was uneasy with Isard and Trabler, he was eager to catch the man who had killed Bel Iblis and hundreds of innocents, and agreed to cooperate.<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" />\n\nThey spent much of the day checking what Isard described as Rebel contact points, and Horn soon realized that the pair were not what they claimed to be; they were from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]]. On confirming his suspicions, he took charge of the interrogation at the next point, the [[Continuum Void]] [[Tapcafe/Legends|tapcafe]]. In the course of it, he realized that the pair were likely [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]], and were chasing something that had been stolen by Savich from a man who had been in that tapcafe. However, he showed the manager a holo of his wife, not of Savich; when the manager claimed not to recognize the holo, Isard, assuming Horn had showed an image of Savich, lacked any lead.<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" />\n\nThey returned to Isard's headquarters, where Horn had a split second of warning through the Force before he was attacked by Trabler. He was able to fend off the Imperial, taking the other man's blaster and firing at Isard. He killed Trabler when the man came after him again, and, in a standoff with Isard, he destroyed his holo of Savich and told Isard that now he was the only chance of her catching the person who had whatever she wanted. He suggested that if he helped her catch Savich, she would let him go and call the deal even. Revealing her true identity, Isard accepted, but forced Horn to wear a [[choke-collar]], which would activate and cut off [[Blood/Legends|blood]] flow to his brain on her order or if she died.<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" />\n\nKnowing through his long experience with her that Savich would be looking for [[gralish liqueur]] and that the Continuum Void was the only establishment in Xakrea that sold it, Horn led Isard back there. After arriving, they learned that Savich had been there with an accomplice, but left again after persuading the manager that he had a family emergency and getting him to leave. Isard was convinced that Savich had run the manager off-world for a reason, and decided to check out his background with Horn. They traveled to Imperial Intelligence's local secret facility to access files, and there Horn received a comm call from Savich, who set up a meeting to turn over the [[Datacard/Legends|datapack]] that had been stolen in exchange for pay.<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" />\n\nOn moving into the tapcafe next to the Intelligence facility, Horn received another call, and was startled to hear a nearby thud from a dropped crate repeated over the comm. He realized Savich was nearby and found one woman who was a possible candidate to be Savich in disguise. However, in the middle of Savich's instructions, she got up and introduced herself to Horn as an old friend, hugging him. When he smelled the gralish liqueur on her breath, he quickly recognized that she was indeed Savich. She used the cover of the hug to pick the lock to his choke-collar and bumped into Isard as she stepped back. Immediately afterwards, [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Nyroska]] of the Darkknell Defense Agency arrived, and the mystery woman, who was indeed Savich, had Nyroska arrest Isard as the Rebel agent; she had palmed Isard's identification card when she bumped into her and now claimed to be Isard herself. When Horn was asked to help make the matter clear, he confessed that the only identification Isard had ever showed him were her false credentials as Glasc. All three were taken to the local precinct to clear up the matter, but Savich escaped her cell before Isard's identity was confirmed. Horn, however, was able to escape any consequences for his role in the matter.<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" />\n\n===Pride and suffering===\n{{Quote|One of the reasons she was a good woman, wife, and mother was because she didn't think about herself first.

Corran tracked them down with several Corellian Security agents in tow and engaged in a battle that turned into a standoff. The bounty hunters offered to let the elder Horn go if Corran would turn himself over to them.

I have a valid warrant for your apprehension for violations of smuggling laws.

While doing so, Corran noticed a man approach Sajsh and attempt to make a delivery for [[Borbor Crisk]]&mdash;a rival [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]]. The Horns kept an eye on the man, and after Sajsh told him to come back later to another stall, they found him returning to an unusual set of companions, one of which appeared to be [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Jodo Kast]]&mdash;he was actually [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] posing as Kast, though Horn never learned that. Corran figured that Thyne would likely want to bring the group back to his fortress for questioning, and considered joining the odd party as a way of getting into the heavily-guarded fortress to actually serve a warrant and [[Capture of Zekka Thyne|arrest]] Thyne. Horn considered it incredibly risky, but the pair continued watching the group.<ref name=\"Side Trip\" />\n\nWhen two of them ran into trouble attempting to save a shopkeeper and his daughter from the [[Brommstaad Mercenaries]], the Horns drew their blasters to protect them, forcing the [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] to stand down. The grateful members of the group introduced themselves as Kast, [[Riij Winward]], [[Rathe Palror]], [[Haber Trell]], and [[Maranne Darmic]]. The Horns passed themselves off as a pair of criminal partners, unrelated to each other and looking for work with Crisk, and suggested that they go along with the others to their meeting with Crisk's agent. Thrawn, the party's leader, decided that Horn would go along with Trell and Palror to the meeting while Corran, Winward, and Darmic unloaded their delivery cargo. Thrawn would provide backup to the first group.<ref name=\"Side Trip\" />\n\n[[File:CorSec_Captain_SWGTCG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hal Horn]]\nHorn's group proceeded to the meeting, and were captured by Thyne's thugs. Taken to Thyne's fortress, they were beaten for information, but had little to offer. Relatively soon, Thrawn and Corran arrived, but Thrawn told Thyne that the group was planning to assassinate him, and turned Corran over. The four prisoners were put in the cellar, and Horn noted from Thrawn's taunts that most of Thyne's enforcers would be gone, ambushing Winward and Darmic. He also noticed that Thrawn had placed a [[molecular stiletto]] on the bars to their cell. Realizing \"Kast\" was playing a complex game to infiltrate Thyne's palace but seemed to be on their side, they used the stiletto to cut their way out and ambushed the guard, giving Trell and Palror the stiletto and telling them to escape on their own while they took on Thyne.<ref name=\"Side Trip\" />\n\nWith most of Thyne's men away, the Horns were able to make it back up to Thyne's office, where Thrawn helped them defeat the guards; Thyne, however, fled through a secret escape tunnel. The CorSec agents followed Thyne down the tunnel and into a cave, where the crime lord began shooting at them. They advanced stealthily through the cave, but Thyne caught Corran and used him as a hostage. He demanded that Horn show himself, which he did, but Horn ordered Thyne to surrender. When it was clear that Thyne would not, Horn agreed to lay down his weapon. Calming his concern at his son's position, he centered himself, focused on aiming at Thyne's eye, and used the Force to project an illusion of himself removing his finger from the trigger. In fact, he kept his carbine on Thyne and triggered a stun shot that incapacitated the crime lord. He explained the feat to Corran as having used his middle finger to stroke the trigger.<ref name=\"Side Trip\" />\n\nThey exited the cave with the unconscious Thyne and ran into a [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] patrol, with Horn having to use a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to keep the stormtroopers from executing them. The commander of the Imperial assault, [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Maximilian Veers/Legends|Maximilian Veers]], had instructions from Thrawn to expect them and allow them to leave with their prisoner, which he did upon learning of the situation. Horn also formally asked Veers for aid in executing his warrant to search Thyne's fortress, giving the colonel legal justification for raiding the building.<ref name=\"Side Trip\" /> Thyne was duly prosecuted and convicted, and he blamed the Horns bitterly for his imprisonment on Kessel.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n{{Quote|I guess, old man, you really aren't gone.

Like all Halcyon Jedi, Horn had a talent for projecting illusions into the minds of others and confusing or persuading them with mind tricks, as well as an inability to perform [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]].<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" /><ref name=\"Side Trip\" /><ref name=\"The Essential Guide to the Force\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref> However, he was only trained as a boy, and after years of not using the Force, even minor exertions of it left him drained.<ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Hal Horn was created by author [[Michael A. Stackpole]] as the father of one of Stackpole's protagonists, Corran Horn.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> Horn was first mentioned as part of his son's backstory in ''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' and much of Horn's own backstory was given in the course of Corran Horn's adventures.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /><ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /><ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" /><ref name=\"The Bacta War\" /><ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /><ref name=\"I, Jedi\" /> While his name was originally given as Hal Horn, and that name is used in almost all sources about Horn, ''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' states that \"Hal\" was the name he was most known by, and he retained the given name Valin.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /><ref name=\"The Krytos Trap\" /> Hal Horn himself made his first appearance in the short story ''[[Side Trip]]'', written by Stackpole and [[Timothy Zahn]].<ref name=\"Side Trip\" /> Horn also appeared in a flashback in [[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]], also written by Stackpole, and in the short story ''[[Interlude at Darkknell]]'', another collaboration between Stackpole and Zahn.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\" /><ref name=\"Interlude at Darkknell\" /> In addition, Horn was a non-player character in the massively multiplayer online [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011.<ref name=\"Star Wars Galaxies\" />\n\nIn ''[[I, Jedi]]'', Horn is said to have been ten years old when his father left to fight in the Clone Wars; however, he also claims to have been ten years old when his father died. Subsequent [[canon]] has not only placed the Clone Wars approximately ten years later than Stackpole placed them, creating a situation in which Horn was barely in his teens when he had Corran, but has also separated Halcyon's departure for the Clone Wars from his death by three years. With those significant contradictions in place, Horn's canonical age remains unclear.<ref name=\"I, Jedi\" />\n\nThe article [[Bounty Hunters' Guild Handbook (article)|''Bounty Hunters' Guild Handbook'']] in [[Star Wars Insider 99|''Star Wars Insider'' 99]] identifies Horn as the head of Corellian Security on Corellia, as does Bossk's entry in the [[Databank (original)|Databank]]&mdash;a claim that would seem to conflict with the implications of Stackpole's stories, in which Horn is portrayed as a well-known but only mid-ranking field agent.<ref name=\"Bounty Hunters' Guild Handbook\">{{InsiderCite|99|Bounty Hunters' Guild Handbook (article)|Bounty Hunters' Guild Handbook}}</ref><ref name=\"Bossk Databank\">{{DB|character|bossk|Bossk|archivedate=20110718213905}}</ref><ref name=\"Side Trip\" /><ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /><ref name=\"I, Jedi\" />\n\nThe art used for Horn's card in the ''[[Galactic Hunters]]'' cardset of the ''[[Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game]]'' is the reused artwork for the \"CorSec Captain\" card from the earlier [[Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|''Champions of the Force'']] cardset.<ref name=\"Galactic Hunters DS\" /><ref name=\"Champions of the Force\">{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Champions_of_the_Force#Card_gallery|cardname=CorSec Captain}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Hal Horn}}\n*''[[Jedi Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Interlude at Darkknell]]''\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Galactic Hunters|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}\n*''[[Side Trip]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' {{Mo}} {{1stID|Valin Horn}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Vision|[[Corran Horn]]}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{FFCite|5|THR2, ''Grand Admiral Thrawn''}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}}\n*{{FFCite|14|ROG3, ''X-wing Rogue Squadron''}}\n*''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 70]]''\n*''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 90]]''\n*''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 126]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|99|Bounty Hunters' Guild Handbook (article)|Bounty Hunters' Guild Handbook}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Champions_of_the_Force#Card_gallery|cardname=CorSec Captain}}\n*[[Scum and Villainy (sourcebook)|''Scum and Villainy'']]\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Galactic Hunters|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Hunters#Card_gallery|cardname=Hal Horn}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 22]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 33]]''\n*{{DB|character|bossk|Bossk|archivedate=20110718213905}}\n*{{DB|character|corranhorn|Horn, Corran|archivedate=20100328092743}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Hal Horn\n|es=Valin Horn (\"Hal\")\n|ja=\u30cf\u30eb\u30fb\u30db\u30fc\u30f3\n|pl=Valin Halcyon\n|ru=\u0425\u0430\u043b \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horn, Hal}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
