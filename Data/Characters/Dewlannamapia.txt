Knowing that made me a&hellip; pragmatist, I guess.|Han Solo, to [[Bria Tharen]]|The Paradise Snare}}\n'''Dewlannamapia''', also known by the shortened name '''Dewlanna''', was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] who, at an old age, followed her mate [[Isshaddik]] in his [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]] from their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. The two joined the crew of [[Liberator (Liberator-class)|''Trader's Luck'']], a [[Starship/Legends|starship]] [[Captain/Legends|captained]] by a [[Human/Legends|Human]] named [[Garris Shrike]] and crewed with [[Youngling/Legends|children]] who worked for him as [[Scoundrel|thieves]]. Even after her mate was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] run, Dewlannamapia remained aboard ''Trader's Luck'', working as a cook. During her days aboard the ship, she met a nine-[[Standard year/Legends|year]]-old [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] boy called [[Han Solo/Legends|Han]]. Dewlannamapia deeply cared for Han and essentially became a surrogate [[Parent/Legends|mother]] for him. She was responsible for discovering Han's last name, [[House of Solo|Solo]], which Shrike had kept secret. Dewlannamapia oversaw Solo's education, and at one point she even saved him when he nearly died from [[Corellian Tanamen Fever]].\n\nIn [[10 BBY/Legends|10 BBY]], hoping to flee from the violent and abusive Shrike, Solo planned an escape from ''Trader's Luck''. When he came to the galley to say goodbye to Dewlannamapia, the two were found by Shrike. A brawl ensued, and Dewlannamapia sacrificed her life to protect Solo from a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shot fired by Shrike. The young [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] successfully escaped from ''Trader's Luck'' and became a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. Believing that he was forever indebted to Dewlannamapia, Solo later saved a Wookiee named [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] from being killed by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Pter Nyklas]]. Solo was expelled from the [[Navy/Legends|Navy]], and he and Chewbacca became smuggling partners. Dewlannamapia was also survived by several cubs; one of them, [[Utchakkaloch]], met Solo at one point and accepted the Corellian as his adoptive brother.\n\n==Biography==\n===Raising the Human cub===\n{{Quote|Your mother was kinder to me than my own.|Han Solo, to Utchakkaloch|The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial}}\n[[File:Kasyyykunleashed.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dewlannamapia followed her mate into exile from Kashyyyk.]]\nDewlannamapia&mdash;\"Dewlanna\" for short&mdash;was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] around [[610 BBY]].<ref name=\"Birth date\" /> She was the mate of [[Isshaddik]] and the [[Parent/Legends|mother]] of several cubs, among them [[Utchakkaloch]].<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> Around [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]],<ref name=\"Exile date\">''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' places [[Isshaddik]]'s [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exile]] ten [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before the events of the novel, which is approximately dated to [[10 BBY/Legends|10 BBY]] by ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''.</ref> Isshaddik was [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] from the family's [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] for a crime he had committed; Dewlannamapia followed her mate into exile, leaving behind her home and her grown cubs. The two of them joined the ragtag [[Scoundrel|criminal]] crew of the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] [[Liberator (Liberator-class)|''Trader's Luck'']], [[Captain/Legends|captained]] by a [[Human/Legends|Human]] named [[Garris Shrike]]. [[19 BBY/Legends|Only a year later]], however, Isshaddik was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] run to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nar Hekka]] in [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]]. Shrike, who was rather fond of Dewlannamapia's cooking, offered her a chance to stay aboard ''Trader's Luck''. Although Dewlannamapia was free to return to Kashyyyk, she chose to accept the proposition and thus became the ship's cook. Aboard the craft, Dewlannamapia stayed in personal quarters near the galley. She befriended a nine-[[Standard year/Legends|year]]-old [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] boy named [[Han Solo/Legends|Han]], one of the many children Shrike employed as thieves and pickpockets.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nDewlannamapia taught Han to speak and understand the Wookiee [[Language/Legends|language]] of [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]].<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|I|187|Dewlannamapia}}</ref> However, it was difficult for Han to reproduce the growls of which Shyriiwook consisted, so he preferred to speak [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]]. As Dewlannamapia understood Basic as well as her own language, the communication between her and Han was fluent. Shrike did not provide his children with education beyond that which was needed in their criminal activities, such as reading and simple math; however, Han's natural desire to defy Shrike led him to pursue further schooling clandestinely. When Dewlannamapia became aware of this, she encouraged Han to study. The young Corellian had a tendency to learn only subjects that he enjoyed and considered useful, like mathematics, and to largely ignore subjects he did not like, particularly history. Dewlannamapia made certain to monitor Han's curriculum, forcing him to learn disciplines that he otherwise would have skipped, and the boy eventually began to like history once he realized that some historical battles were as interesting as the ones he had read about in adventure [[Book/Legends|books]].<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> Dewlannamapia also taught Han to prepare meals, and he became a fair cook himself. She kept in contact with her son Utchakkaloch, telling him anecdotes about the young Han who loved her [[wastril bread]], and who craved to become a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]].<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\">''[[Rebel Dawn]]''</ref>\n\nOne day, an unconscious Han was brought aboard ''Trader's Luck'', having fallen sick with high fever after a mission he had performed for Shrike on the planet [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], during which Han had stolen some valuable jewelry. Dewlannamapia tended to the boy, and, fearing for his life, insisted that Shrike take him to a [[Medical droid/Legends|medical droid]] on Corellia. Shrike was unwilling to spend [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]] on Han's treatment, believing that the boy would recuperate soon. Deciding to take the matter into her own hands, Dewlannamapia commandeered a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] and took Han to a [[Medic/Legends|medical]] [[Droid/Legends|droid]]. Upon examining the Human, the droid concluded that Han had a severe case of [[Corellian Tanamen Fever]], and that he could have died had Dewlannamapia not brought him to Corellia. The droid prescribed a course of [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] immersion therapy, for which Dewlannamapia paid from her own savings. After Han spent some [[Time/Legends|time]] in a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]] and got better, the two returned to ''Trader's Luck''. Shrike was furious at Dewlannamapia for disobeying his orders, but the Wookiee stood her ground and insisted that she had done the right thing. Shrike eventually calmed down when he realized that one of the pieces of jewelry that Han had stolen the night he had fallen ill was a set with a genuine [[Krayt dragon pearl/Legends|Krayt dragon pearl]] that was worth a fortune. Still, Shrike never repaid Dewlannamapia for Han's medical bills.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nOne thing that had always bothered Han was the fact that he did not know his last name. He had been orphaned at an early age and brought to ''Trader's Luck'' by Shrike, who had never spoken of Han's parents. When Han told his worries to Dewlannamapia, she decided to help him out once again. In order to spend more time with Shrike, she learned how to play [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] and often participated in games against her boss. When Han [[18 BBY/Legends|was eleven]], the elderly Wookiee's strategy finally paid off. One night, while she and Shrike were playing sabacc, the man grew very [[Alcohol/Legends|drunk]] and started bragging about the [[Krayt dragon/Legends|dragon]] pearl that Han had acquired for him and that Shrike had sold for a large sum. With a slip of his tongue, Shrike revealed that the boy's last name was \"[[House of Solo|Solo]].\" When Dewlannamapia tried to find out more about Han's parents or other relatives, Shrike became suspicious and did not tell her anything else. The Wookiee then made her way to Han's small cubicle and informed the boy of her discovery. Han was filled with joy and proudly called himself \"Han Solo\" from that point on.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nThe next time ''Trader's Luck'' stopped at Corellia, Solo visited the [[Corellia public archives|local public archives]] to research his last name. He discovered that the Solo lineage was both famous and infamous; a man named [[Berethron e Solo]] had been the last [[King/Legends|King]] of Corellia and had introduced democracy to his planet [[312 BBY|three centuries ago]], while more recently, a [[Dalla Solo]] had emerged as a ruthless [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]], murderer, and kidnapper better known as \"Dalla the Black.\" Solo also uncovered evidence of living members of the Solo family, including a reclusive widow named [[Tiion Sal-Solo]] and her only son, [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]]. Wondering whether he was truly related to them, Solo consulted Dewlannamapia regarding his curiosity, and she encouraged him to seek out Tiion and Thrackan, hoping that they would adopt him and protect him from Shrike. Solo eventually escaped from ''Trader's Luck'' and tracked down the Sal-Solos on Corellia. He lived in [[Sal-Solo mansion|their mansion]] for six [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] and learned that Tiion was, in fact, his aunt, which made Thrackan his cousin. However, Thrackan turned out to be a violent and sadistic bully who sold Solo out to Shrike. Shrike brought the boy back aboard ''Trader's Luck'' and violently beat him for daring to escape.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\n===The ultimate sacrifice===\n{{Quote|You want me&hellip; to go&hellip; to live. And to be&hellip; happy. Okay! I'll go. I still have time to get aboard that robot ship before it takes off. I promise. I'll go now. And I swear I'll always remember you, Dewlanna.|Han Solo's last words to Dewlannamapia|The Paradise Snare}}\nSolo tried to escape from Shrike several more times, but each attempt ended with the boy being severely beaten. After one debacle<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> in [[12 BBY/Legends|12 BBY]]<ref name=\"Date2\">The incident is dated two years prior to the main events of ''[[The Paradise Snare]]'', approximately dated to [[10 BBY/Legends|10 BBY]] by ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''.</ref>&mdash;when Solo, feeling cocky after winning the [[Gladiator/Legends|gladiatorial]] [[Regional Sector Number Four's All-Human Free-For-All|Jubilar-Free-For-All]], attempted to take on Shrike&mdash;he was left with thoroughly split lips, and Dewlannamapia had to feed him mush for a week until they healed.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> In [[10 BBY/Legends|10 BBY]],<ref name=\"ERC\" /> the nineteen-year-old Solo decided to undertake another escape attempt. Having obtained a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]], Solo made his way to ''Trader's Luck''{{'s}} galley to say goodbye to Dewlannamapia. He informed her that he was planning to stow away aboard the ''[[Ylesian Dream]]'', an automated droid [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] that was docked to ''Trader's Luck'' and was due to depart soon. He would then make his way to the planet [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]], a religious colony near [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] Space that offered pilgrims sanctuary from the [[The galaxy/Legends|outside universe]]. The [[T'landa Til|Ylesian priests]] were also looking for a pilot, and Solo hoped to take the job, having already spent all his money to send them a message and tell the [[Priest/Legends|priests]] that he would be coming for a job interview. Solo also told the Wookiee that he would send for her once he had settled on Ylesia.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\n[[File:Han-TPS.jpg|thumb|right|Han Solo at the time of his escape from Shrike]]\nUpon hearing that Solo did not have any money left, Dewlannamapia offered all her savings to the Corellian. The latter initially protested but eventually accepted the money, assuring the Wookiee that he would return the debt. At that moment, Shrike entered the galley, accompanied by two more crew members, his brother [[Larrad Shrike|Larrad]] and the [[Elomin/Legends|Elomin]] [[Brafid]]. Shrike accused Solo of betrayal and threatened him with another beating and [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] [[Blood/Legends|blood]]-[[Poison/Legends|poisoning]]. Trying to protect Solo, Dewlannamapia stood between him and Shrike, although Solo unsuccessfully tried to convince her not to intervene. A fight broke out, during which Brafid was shot by Solo, and Larrad was incapacitated by Dewlannamapia, who broke his [[Limb/Legends|arm]]. Shrike then aimed his blaster at Solo, ordering Dewlannamapia to cease fighting lest he kill him. The Wookiee complied, and Solo dropped his own weapon and surrendered.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nHowever, Shrike said that he was condemning Solo to death and prepared to kill him. In the last moment, Dewlannamapia shoved Solo aside and leaped at Shrike, catching the blaster bolt right in the chest. Angered, Solo tackled Shrike; the latter fell and his head impacted on the deck, knocking him out. When Solo rushed to Dewlannamapia's side, she told him to escape from the ship as fast as possible, but the Corellian wished to remain with her to comfort her until she died. Telling him that he would make her sacrifice meaningless if he refused to go, Dewlannamapia wished Solo a good and happy life, telling him that she would be fine after death, as she would become [[Force ghost|one]] with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Leaving the Wookiee on the galley floor, Solo rushed to the [[Hangar/Legends|docking bay]], where he boarded the ''Ylesian Dream''. Dewlannamapia died, but her sacrifice allowed Solo to escape from ''Trader's Luck''.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|I'm perfectly capable of lookin' after myself, and don't you forget it.

So I saved you, 'cause I owed her.|A drunken Han Solo, to Chewbacca|The Hutt Gambit}}\n[[File:HanSoloImpCadet.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Solo as an Imperial cadet, shortly before saving Chewbacca]]\nHaving come to regard Dewlannamapia as the mother he never had, Solo missed the Wookiee deeply, and the memories of her death brought emotional pain to him for long afterward. He often imagined Dewlannamapia alive, and those images were so real that he at times could almost hear her voice. Solo swore to himself that he would repay Dewlannamapia by helping her people at any opportunity. After a series of adventures, Solo made his way to the [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to apply for the [[Academy of Carida]] in hopes of becoming a pilot in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. Shrike, who had survived the brawl aboard ''Trader's Luck'', tracked him there but was killed by a [[Unidentified bounty hunter (Coruscant)|bounty hunter]], whom Solo in turn killed.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> Utchakkaloch also became aware of his mother's death, although he did not know of the exact circumstances surrounding it.<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" />\n\nAfter successfully graduating from the Academy, Solo was given the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]]. His service with the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] was relatively short, however.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\">''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''</ref> Around [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]],<ref name=\"Saved date\">The event is referenced in ''[[The Hutt Gambit]]'', which is approximately dated to [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]] by ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> Solo saved a Wookiee [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] named [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" />&mdash;Dewlannamapia's distant relative<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" />&mdash;from being killed by [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Pter Nyklas|Nyklas]] on Coruscant. Solo helped the Wookiee escape slavery, was discharged from the Navy, and became a smuggler. Chewbacca also swore a [[Life debt/Legends|life debt]] to Solo and refused to leave his side, much to the Corellian's dismay, as he wanted to be left alone and felt that he had saved the Wookiee only to repay Dewlannamapia. He soon changed his mind and came to consider Chewbacca his best friend.<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> In [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]],<ref name=\"Wedding date\">The event is depicted in ''[[Rebel Dawn]]'', which is approximately dated to [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]] by ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> Solo attended the [[Wedding of Chewbacca and Mallatobuck|wedding]] of Chewbacca and his mate [[Mallatobuck/Legends|Mallatobuck]] on Kashyyyk. It was there that he met Utchakkaloch, who wanted to know how his mother had died. Solo told him that his mother had died a hero while protecting him from Shrike and that she had been avenged when Shrike had been killed. Utchakkaloch was glad to hear this, and he accepted Solo as his \"adoptive brother,\" since they had been raised by the same \"mother.\"<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" />\n\nAs of [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]], Solo still felt that Dewlannamapia's loving upbringing, among other deeds and sacrifices that his Wookiee friends had made for him over the years, made Solo indebted to the Wookiees rather than the other way around. He expressed this belief when he tried to discourage Chewbacca's son [[Lumpawaroo/Legends|Lumpawaroo]] and nephew [[Lowbacca]] from taking on Chewbacca's life debt in the wake of the latter's [[Destruction of Sernpidal|death]].<ref name=\"Hero's Trial\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref> In his interviews to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic's]]&mdash;and later, the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance's]]&mdash;[[Historical Council]], Solo remembered Dewlannamapia as the only bright spot in his early life.<ref name=\"EC\">[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]</ref><ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I&hellip;I feel the same way, Dewlanna. You're the closest thing to a mother I'll ever have.|Han Solo, to a dying Dewlannamapia|The Paradise Snare}}\nAlmost six hundred years of age at the time of her death, Dewlannamapia was considered old even by Wookiee standards. She had blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Her [[Hair/Legends|fur]] was initially [[Color/Legends|tan]] in color, but it began graying with age. She was devoted to her mate Isshaddik, willingly following him into exile&mdash;although she was not required to do so&mdash;and never speaking of his crime. After joining the crew of ''Trader's Luck'', Dewlannamapia developed a bond with the young Han Solo. She became the closest thing that the Corellian had to a mother<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> or, due to her old age, a grandmother.<ref name=\"Tatooine Ghost\">''[[Tatooine Ghost]]''</ref> She often ruffled up his hair so that he looked attractively \"scruffy,\" with his hair standing up like a Wookiee's, despite Solo's protests. Dewlannamapia deeply worried for Solo's health and well-being, ensuring that he had the best possible education and paying for his treatment when he was struck with Corellian Tanamen Fever.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\nDewlannamapia went to great lengths to help the young Corellian. She learned how to play sabacc with the sole purpose of spending more time with Garris Shrike and learning Han's last name, and she gave the boy all of her savings when he approached her to say goodbye. Shortly after this, she willingly took a blaster shot intended for Solo so that he could continue to live and be happy.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> Overall, Solo considered her to be a hero who had sacrificed her life to save his.<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" /> In his adult life, he remembered both Dewlannamapia's love and wisdom, recalling old Wookiee proverbs she used to tell him, such as, \"Joy unmixed with sorrow is suspect\" and \"To have a good memory is to be both blessed and cursed&hellip;\" Unlike the majority of ''Trader's Luck''{{'s}} occupants, Dewlannamapia was not afraid of Shrike, openly arguing with him, defying him, and violating his orders on several occasions. Dewlannamapia was usually calm and lovable, but she fell into a battle rage when trying to protect Solo during his successful escape attempt. She fought fiercely, grabbing Larrad Shrike by the wrist, spinning and snapping him like a whip, and ultimately breaking his arm.<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" />\n\n[[File:WastrilBread.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dewlannamapia often baked wastril bread.]]\nDewlannamapia was a believer in the Force, which, due to the intricacies of Shyriiwook, Solo mistranslated as \"life-power.\" She believed in it steadfastly and was certain that she would become a spirit in the afterlife, safe with the Force. Although Dewlannamapia was unable to speak Basic, she easily understood it. She was also a capable pilot, competently handling the controls of the shuttle she took to deliver Solo to a medical droid on Corellia. Dewlannamapia was a very good cook, and she was given a place aboard ''Trader's Luck'' mainly because Shrike liked her cooking, although not to the point that he considered her indispensable. Dewlannamapia often baked Solo's favorite wastril [[Bread/Legends|bread]]<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> and prepared [[nerf sausage]]s.<ref name=\"The Emperor's Plague\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Emperor's Plague]]''</ref> When translated from Shyriiwook to Basic, Dewlannamapia's name had several parts. \"Dew\" meant \"fierce, stern, stout\"; \"lanna\" meant \"cry, growl\" or \"roar\"; and \"mapia\" stood for \"rain, season,\" or \"storm.\"<ref name=\"GGC\">''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDewlannamapia first appeared in the [[1997]] novel ''[[The Paradise Snare]]'', the first volume of ''[[The Han Solo Trilogy]]'' written by [[A. C. Crispin|Ann Crispin]]. Although the Wookiee was killed in the same story,<ref name=\"The Paradise Snare\" /> she was mentioned in both the second and third installments of the trilogy, ''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''<ref name=\"The Hutt Gambit\" /> and ''[[Rebel Dawn]]'',<ref name=\"Rebel Dawn\" /> as well as in several other novels and reference books. Nevertheless, ''The Paradise Snare'' remains her only appearance. Although Dewlannamapia first appeared in ''The Paradise Snare'', the character's origins can be traced back to [[George Lucas]]'s [[1974]] [[The Star Wars: Rough Draft|rough draft]] of what would eventually become [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].
