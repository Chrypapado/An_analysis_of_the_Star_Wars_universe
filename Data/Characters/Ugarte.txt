He grew up on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] on [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]], but never fit in with his culture, not as a member of his tribe, or in the various Ugnuaght gangs that were comprised of members from multiple tribes.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" /> From an early age, Ugarte knew what he wanted; to be rich.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> He found work at a [[pub]] that was a known tourist trap that boasted an exotic, alien staff, serving as a [[busboy]] for several [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. During his time there, he made several contacts, including grifters who would swindle tourists for thousands of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Seeing the money to be made, Ugarte struck out on his own.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\nHowever, Ugarte was less than successful; while he had the ability to source potential profits, he usually lacked the ability to secure it. As such, he moved from one scam to the other, always burning himself on the deal and generally anyone else involved in the deal. His favorite hangout was [[K'cri's Cafe]], and he considered [[K'cri Elban]] to be a friend, which was not reciprocated by the [[Human/Legends|Human]]. Ugarte was always on the lookout for an investor for one of his schemes, or to unload stolen wares.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nUgarte was a one [[Imperial standard meter|meter]] tall Ugnaught with dirty [[Color/Legends|pink]] skin and white hair. His speech was high-pitched, and he distorted his vowels. Above all else, Ugarte's main goal was to get rich.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nUgarte had connections with the criminal underworld, and was an effective con man.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nUgarte always carried a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] and a [[Alcohol/Legends|liquor]] [[Flask/Legends|flask]].<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Con artists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ugnaughts]]"}}}]}}}}
