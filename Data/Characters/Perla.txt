Perla used her job to run a large-scale [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] operation, utilizing the department's [[Freighter/Legends|barges]]. Her successes were based on the lack of inspection on the barges. She offered [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] an opportunity to get off of Coruscant without notice if he paid her a large sum. it turns out that she had been delivering a stockpile of weapons and supplies to [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] in exchange to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]]. After giving the supplies, she was offered by Mothma to command a freighter in the [[Alliance Fleet|fleet]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 5|''Star Wars'' (2013) 5]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 6|''Star Wars'' (2013) 6]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 7|''Star Wars'' (2013) 7]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 8|''Star Wars'' (2013) 8]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 10|''Star Wars'' (2013) 10]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 11|''Star Wars'' (2013) 11]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 12|''Star Wars'' (2013) 12]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 15|''Star Wars'' (2013) 15]]\n*[[Star Wars (2013) 18|''Star Wars'' (2013) 18]] {{Mo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Perla#legends\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance Fleet captains]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
