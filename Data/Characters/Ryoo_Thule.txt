The two secretly plotted to marry off their children, Jobal and [[Ruwee Naberrie/Legends|Ruwee]], and were the first to be surprised when they both actually fell in love.<ref name=\"TLotJDoN\" /> The young couple got married in [[51 BBY/Legends|51 BBY]].<ref name=\"FF140\">{{FFCite|140|FAM 1-2, ''Skywalker Family Tree''}}</ref> Winama died in [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], a year before the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]].<ref name=\"Star Wars Episode I Journal: Queen Amidala\">''[[Star Wars Episode I Journal: Queen Amidala]]''</ref>\n\nThule's great-granddaughter, [[Ryoo Naberrie/Legends|Ryoo Naberrie]], was named after her.

Feeling great grief at her beloved grandchild's passing, Thule spent the next six [[Standard month/Legends|months]] mourning at [[Translucence Cove]] in [[Varykino/Legends|Varykino]].<ref name=\"TLotJDoN\" />\n\nAfter all these months, Thule finally decided that it was [[Time/Legends|time]] to return to [[Theed/Legends|Theed]], as she knew that Amidala would not have wanted her to live in seclusion for the rest of her life. However, Thule had been having a strange feeling ever since she woke up, but tried to comfort herself by thinking that she was only anxious to let go of her grief. It was the only possible explanation why her [[Heart/Legends|heart]] fluttered, or why Amidala felt so especially close to her that morning.<ref name=\"TLotJDoN\" />\n\nThule suddenly realized she was not alone in the retreat. A man named [[Malorum]], one of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire's]] [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitors]], had come to interrogate Thule about Amidala and her mysterious pregnancy. As soon as Thule saw his [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], she understood what she had been feeling all morning. She knew she was going to die. Eventually, Malorum proved her right. Her hesitation and defiance to his questions led him to deduce that Amidala's offspring had not died. The Inquisitor then proceeded to kill Thule. A short while later, [[Ferus Olin]] and [[Trever Flume]] arrived in turn at Varykino. With her dying breath, Thule begged Olin to protect her granddaughter's memory.<ref name=\"TLotJDoN\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:FerusVsMalorum.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Ferus Olin and Malorum fighting to death]]\n{{Quote|He suspects.''\"<br />\"''Malorum?''\"<br />\"''He can't tell anyone what he knows.

I was there to support our grieving family.|Ryoo Thule, to Inquisitor Malorum|The Last of the Jedi: Death on Naboo}}\nRyoo Thule was a small and sturdy female Human with white hair and dark gray eyes dusted with gold. She had a great sense of family and cared deeply for her relatives. While walking down to Varykino's [[Unidentified Naboo lake|lake]], she could feel the presence of her lost ones, such as her husband and her recently deceased grandchild Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Thule was devastated when Amidala&mdash;to whom she had felt closer than any of her other granddaughters&mdash;mysteriously died, shortly after the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. The tragedy led Thule to live in isolation for six months.<ref name=\"TLotJDoN\" />\n\nThule also seemed to have a certain sense of [[Precognition/Legends|precognition]]. On the [[Standard day/Legends|day]] of her death, she woke up before dawn with the unsettling feeling that something was wrong, and as soon as she saw Malorum, she knew the Inquisitor would eventually kill her.<ref name=\"TLotJDoN\" />\n\nWhen Malorum confronted Thule, he felt that the elderly woman was full of love, strength, and courage. Even though she was deeply afraid of him and already knew what he would do to her, Thule stood up to the Inquisitor and refused to tell him what he wanted to know out of love and loyalty to Amidala.<ref name=\"TLotJDoN\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|It is not known who Jobal Naberrie's father was, but her mother is thought to have been called Ryoo, after the blue and yellow flower that grew in the outlying hills near the village of Keren.|Jobal Naberrie's article in ''The Official Star Wars Fact File'' 80|The Official Star Wars Fact File 80}}\nThe character of Ryoo Thule was first mentioned in the [[The Official Star Wars Fact File 80|eightieth issue]] of ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]'', published in [[2003]].<ref name=\"FF\" /> She later made her first appearance in [[Jude Watson]]'s young reader novel ''[[The Last of the Jedi: Death on Naboo]]'', released in [[April]] [[2006]].<ref name=\"TERC\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Death on Naboo]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|80|NAB 1-4, ''Jobal Naberrie''}} {{1stm}}\n*{{FFCite|105|NAB 7-8, ''Sola Naberrie''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|86|Jedi Library (Star Wars Insider)|Jedi Library}}\n*''[[Star Wars Annual 2009]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|ryoonaberrie|Naberrie, Ryoona|archivedate=20100209165919}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ryoo Thule\n|es=Ryoo Thule\n|pl=Ryoo Thule\n|ru=\u0420\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0443\u043b\u0435\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thule, Ryoo}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:House Naberrie]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
