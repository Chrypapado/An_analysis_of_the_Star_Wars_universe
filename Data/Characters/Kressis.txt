In circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Kressis was operating a [[harvester]] vehicle when the farm fell under attack from the [[Believers]], an Almas-based [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]]. Following the attack, the farm was abandoned and Kressis made his way to [[Building 49-A]], Almas' only [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]]. The [[Heroes of Cularin]]&mdash;a group of freelance [[Agent/Legends|agents]] that were investigating a Believer plot to poison all of the kaluthin on Almas&mdash;traveled to the cantina during the course of their investigation, and encountered Kressis.\n\n{{RPG}}\nKressis agreed to take the agents to the Sotose farm, and they traveled there in an [[Airspeeder/Legends|airspeeder]]. On arrival, Kressis explained to agents about the farm's features and layout, and he remained inside the speeder, clutching a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]] and nervously looking around. The agents were then contacted by the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] [[Gilloma]] via a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], who informed them of a sighting of the Believers at a nearby farm. They left to investigate and Kressis chose to remain behind, to guard Sotose's farm.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKressis appeared in ''[[The Kaluthin Are Always Greener]]'', a [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game|role-playing]] module that formed part of the [[Living Force (roleplaying campaign)|Living Force]] campaign. During the scenario, the players&mdash;who role-play as the Heroes of Cularin&mdash;encounter Kressis and if they tell him that are working on the behalf of the [[Forard research station]], he offers to take them to the Sotose farm.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Kaluthin Are Always Greener]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Trandoshans]]"}}}]}}}}
