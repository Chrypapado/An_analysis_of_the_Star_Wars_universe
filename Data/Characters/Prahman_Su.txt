Su became friends and rivals with fellow scoundrel [[Brali Ixxis]] when the pair worked together on a [[clotheslegging]] job near the [[Cron Drift/Legends|Cron Drift]], which they mutually botched. The pair then began running semi-regular games of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] on Su's [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], which became known as [[Ixxis and Su's Floating Game]]. A game would begin whenever the pair both found themselves in the [[City/Legends|city]] at the same time and would then move from location to location. Players who wished to enter required a personal invite from Ixxis or Su, as well as a 5000{{Cr}} initial stake. The game attracted large numbers of up and coming [[Gambling/Legends|gamblers]] and card sharks, although those without the necessary money where beaten an robbed upon arrival.<ref name=\"SoF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPrahman Su was first mentioned in ''[[Suns of Fortune]]'', a sourcebook released in [[2014]] for [[Fantasy Flight Games]] ''[[Star Wars: Edge of the Empire]]'' roleplaying system.
