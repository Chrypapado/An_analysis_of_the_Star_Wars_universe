During the war, he hired a group of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] to steal the [[Jewel of Yavin]], a [[Corusca gem/Legends|Corusca gem]] owned by [[Marus Grayson]], an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] whom he had a grudge against. He sent his daughter [[Aris Shen]] to coordinate the group, and informed the thieves they would steal the gem twice. They would first drive up prices at an auction for the gem, the payment for which they would steal, and then steal the gem itself. Once the thieves succeeded however, Shen double-crossed them and attempted to kill them, although he was unsuccessful. Shen owned a [[Courier-class yacht|''Courier''-class]] [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] named the [[Venture (Courier-class yacht)|''Venture'']].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Jewel of Yavin]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shen, Arend}}\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pantorans]]"}}}]}}}}
