She then gave him a card that granted an audience with Chawin. Jak went to see Chawin and negotiated for an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] which he then gave to the [[Anklebiter Brigade]] so that they could use it as a distraction against [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] forces who were fighting for control of [[CoCo Town]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]].
