During his time in the service of the [[House of Organa]], he [[captain]]ed the [[CR90 corvette]]s ''[[Tantive III]]'' and ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Antilles was killed in action during the [[secret mission to Tatooine]] while trying to protect [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] from being captured by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Antilles-SWE.png|thumb|left|200px|A younger Antilles circa 19 BBY.]]\nA [[human]] [[Gender|male]], Raymus Antilles [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the influential and peaceful [[planet]] of [[Alderaan]].<ref name=\"SWE\" /> He was schooled in [[Diplomat|diplomacy]] and became a capable [[starship]] [[pilot]]. Eventually, he came to work for the [[House of Organa]], being entrusted to [[transport]] its members across [[the galaxy]]. As such, he served in the command staff of [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa]], [[Marriage|husband]] to [[Queen]] [[Breha Organa|Breha]] of Alderaan.<ref name=\"DB\" /> Towards the end of the [[Clone Wars]], Antilles piloted the [[CR70 corvette]] ''[[Tantive III]]'' for Bail.<ref name=\"ROTS\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\n===Imperial Era===\n{{Quote|Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.|C-3PO, to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nDuring the [[Proclamation of the New Order|fall]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] and the early [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], Antilles was [[captain]] of the ''Tantive III''. He was present when Bail saved [[Jedi Master]]s [[Yoda]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] from the [[Great Jedi Purge]]. After the [[Reproduction|birth]] of [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]'s [[twin]]s [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], Antilles was given charge of Amidala's two [[droid]]s, [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]], and was instructed to [[Memory wipe|wipe]] the latter's memory.<ref name=\"ROTS\" /> Antilles knew that Leia was Bail's adoptive daughter and over the [[Standard year|years]] began to serve her as well as her father, but did not know the truth about her birth parents.{{Fact}}\n\n====Early rebellion====\nA [[18 BBY|year]] after the [[Republic Era|fall of the Republic]], Antilles was present when former [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] broke onto the ''[[Tantive IV]]'' and into Bail's quarters to discuss joining [[Bail Organa's resistance movement|the rebellion]]. Concerned about Bail's safety, Antilles abruptly entered Bail's quarters with a security team whilst he was talking to Tano, but Bail assured him that she was a friend. Shortly after, Antilles was having a conversation with Bail in the ''Tantive IV's'' mess hall, when Tano approached the pair to devise a plan to help her remaining friends on the [[moon]] [[Raada]]. Once signaled by Tano, Antilles and the ''Tantive IV'', along with several other transports and [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wings]], traveled to Raada to help [[Raada Uprising|evacuate]] the [[farmer]]s on the moon from Imperial occupation.<ref name=\"Ahsoka\" />\n\nOver the following years, Antilles carefully steered the ''Tantive IV'' through countless Imperial [[blockade]]s and checkpoints, always able to avoid suspicion and detection. Antilles also served alongside [[Toshma Jefkin]] for years, sharing many close encounters with Imperial forces.<ref name=\"Raymus\">{{Shortstory|story=Raymus|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Escaping Scarif====\n{{Quote|Your Highness, the transmission we received.

He continued to serve [[Prince]]ss Leia, after she succeeded her [[Parent|father]] as Senator of Alderaan.<ref name=\"anh-psfb\">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> Like few others save her adoptive father, the princess came to trust and rely upon Antilles to the point she insisted of ensuring his family was well provided during his time by her side.<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\nIn [[0 BBY]], the Rebel Alliance went to [[Scarif]] to [[Battle of Scarif|steal]] the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], an Imperial [[battle station]] equipped with a [[superlaser]] capable of destroying [[planet]]s.<ref name=\"Rogue One\">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> Prior to leaving for the battle, Antilles warned Organa about the possibility that the Empire could track them down by detecting any trace of an abnormal [[hyperspace]] wake, having a very bad feeling about the mission, but Organa insisted to go.<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\nDuring the Battle of Scarif, the [[Rogue One]] squad succeeded in stealing the [[Death]] Star plans and transmitting them to the ''[[Profundity]]'' before the [[Imperial security complex]] was all but destroyed by the [[superweapon]]'s laser under the orders of [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. Antilles was given the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] after [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader's]] attack on the ''[[Profundity]]'' and immediately rushed the plans to the princess as they escaped into [[hyperspace]] aboard the ''Tantive IV''.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\n====Journey to Tatooine====\n{{Quote|We intercepted no transmissions! This is a consular ship! We're on a diplomatic mission!|Antilles' final words, to Darth Vader|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nInstead of traveling to Alderaan, Leia ordered Raymus to take them to the planet [[Tatooine]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], where she hoped to find the [[Jedi]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and deliver a message to him from her father. Antilles shifted course and picked out a new route that adhered to no line, but instead doubled back on himself; first jumping to [[Ukio]]], then [[Roon]], and then [[Kowak]]. The corvette next jumped to [[Hypori]], but found Vader's [[flagship]], the ''[[Devastator]]'', was waiting for them there, with Vader having used [[the Force]] to track them. The Star Destroyer released a salvo that damaged the ''Tantive IV'', but with its [[hyperdrive]] still intact, the corvette jumped again and traveled to [[Iskalon]] and then [[Vuzsa/Canon|Vuzsa]].<ref name=\"Odyssey\" />\n\nShortly after jumping into [[hyperspace]] during the trip, Antilles checked with the senior officers who confirmed his fear of abnormal hyperspace wake. Antilles realized that they couldn\u2019t have had a worse ship for their current critical mission, given their fried electrical gird from the ''Profundity's'' electrical overload.<ref name=\"Raymus\" /> Unfortunately for the the Rebels, the ''Devastator'' was still tracking them and matching their course.<ref name=\"Odyssey\" /> Still worried about the Princess' security, Antilles asked Leia to use one of the [[escape pod]]s, but [[Chief Petty Officer]] [[Corla Metonae]] as the ''Tantive IV'' was still flying under a diplomatic flag, the Empire would not dare to board them, but Antilles really doubted that could happen given the importance of what Rogue One had stolen from Scarif and that Darth Vader had been dispatched to retrieve the plans.<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\nOne of the bosuns also intercepted an Imperial transmission, priority red. This directive allowed any CR90 corvettes to be searched and held, confirming Antilles' fears. The most dire news of all, however, was the report from [[Second Officer]] [[Toshma Jefkin]] of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] in the hall of the ''Profundity.'' With little time left, Antilles returned to his quarters and attempted to write three letters, one for his [[Raymus Antilles's wife|wife]], and two for his daughters, but he was never able to find the words. As he was gathering his thoughts around the Alderaanian corvette exited hyperspace and they soon realized the ''Devastator'' was not far behind.<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\n===Boarding of the ''Tantive IV''===\n[[File:Antilles.png|thumb|left|286x286px|Antilles strangled by Darth Vader during his interrogation aboard the Tantive IV.]]\nAfter jumping from Vuzsa,<ref name=\"Odyssey\" /> the ''Tantive IV\u2019s'' motivator finally gave out and forced the ship out of hyperspace in the [[Tatoo system]].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> Shortly after this, Vader\u2019s Star Destroyer emerged from hyperspace and began pummeling the corvette with [[turbolaser]] fire. Antilles ordered the rear guns to fire back and to put full power to the rear [[deflector shield]].<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\nRealizing that the ship was lost but that he could still save the princess, Antilles searched desperately for Organa after assembling his security forces until he found her with R2-D2. Antilles asked Organa to escape in a pod, but she refused to leave. Wanting to end his life like he lived it, by fighting, Antilles rushed down the hall and started to shoot at his enemies. The captain was able to kill several [[stormtrooper]]s before three of them tackled him and identified him as the ship's captain. Antilles was then brought to Darth Vader, who had boarded the [[corvette]].<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\nUpon being notified that the Death Star plans weren't on the main computer, Vader asked Antilles what they had done with the plans while strangling him. A loyal guard to the princess, the captain protected Leia's identity, assuring the [[Sith Lord]] that they had received no transmissions because the ''Tantive IV'' was a consular ship on a diplomatic mission, leading Vader to ask Antilles where the [[ambassador]] was in that case as Antilles desperately fought for air.<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\nAs he began to lose consciousness, Raymus Antilles found himself strangely hopeful. Acknowledging that his life had come to an end, Antilles hoped before expiring that Leia would find a way to escape and deliver the plans to the rebellion so they could destroy the Death Star.<ref name=\"Raymus\" /> The [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]] then tossed Antilles' lifeless body to the side after the unsuccessful interrogation.<ref name=\"ANH\" /> The Imperials then released the captain's corpse into the void of [[Realspace|space]] along with those of his crew.<ref name=\"Odyssey\">''[[The Odyssey of Star Wars: An Epic Poem]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA loyal servant to the royal family of Alderaan, Raymus Antilles was a level-headed captain entrusted by Bail Organa's command staff.<ref name=\"DB\" /> Antilles' main priority was the safety of Bail Organa and his family, willing to break with a security team into Bail's quarters to protect him if he felt that there was any danger.<ref name=\"Ahsoka\" /> Antilles was very dutiful to Organa, as demonstrated when the Viceroy entrusted him with wiping out the memory of C-3PO.<ref name=\"ROTS\" />\n\nIn the years leading up to the Galactic Civil War, Antilles continued to serve the Organas by being entrusted the safety of Princess Leia Organa.<ref name=\"DB\" /> When it became clear that the Empire would soon find them, Antilles was more concerned about the princess' safety than his own, having warned her previously of the dangers of the mission and asking her to leave the ''Tantive IV'' with an escape pod. As captain, Antilles was willing to go down with his ship if necessary.<ref name=\"Raymus\" /> A brave man, Antilles remained loyal to the princess and the rebellion to the end, refusing to reveal her identity to Darth Vader and even lying to the fearsome Sith [[Lord]], who strangled him to death.<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\nAntilles loved and cared for his family. Shortly before his death, Antilles tried to write three letters for his beloved wife and their two young daughters, whom he had barely seen, with two of them destined for his daughters to see once they grew up to tell them that while they would grow up without him to their side, it wasn't because for the lack of his love for them, but because he loved them so much that he was determined to give everything to ensure they could live the life they deserved. By this point, Antilles realized that the most bitter irony of war was that his greatest acts of love for his family were the very ones that kept him apart from them.<ref name=\"Raymus\" />\n\nRaymus Antilles was a human male who stood 1.88 [[meter]]s<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" /> and had Light skin, [[Color|brown]] [[eye]]s and brown [[hair]].<ref name=\"SWE\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRaymus Antilles was played by [[Peter Geddis]] in the [[1977]] original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> [[Rohan Nichol]] later played Antilles in the [[2005]] film [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref name=\"ROTS\" /> [[Tim Beckmann]] then played Antilles in the [[2016]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name=\"Rogue One\" />\n\nFor Antilles' appearance in ''Revenge of the Sith'', director [[George Lucas]] proposed [[Denis Lawson]], who played [[Wedge Antilles]] in the [[original trilogy]], to appear as Antilles as [[Jeremy Bulloch]] had a cameo playing [[Jeremoch Colton]]. Lucas cast Nichol, his original choice, after Lawson turned down the offer.{{Fact}}\n\nNichol suffered an accidental shaving incident leaving a noticeable nick on his chin that would not stop bleeding prior to filming for ''Revenge of the Sith''. After apologizing to George Lucas for the blemish, the latter jokingly responded that the character \"must have gotten it in the Clone Wars\".<ref>{{SWArchive|url=episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon164.html|text=Homing Beacon #164 \u2013 Captain Antilles Speaks!|archivedate=20061201041333}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|\n*''[[Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]\n*[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]\n*[[Ahsoka (audiobook)|''Ahsoka'' audiobook]]\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=9|story=[[Trouble Again]]}}\n*''[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan]]''\n*[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan (audiobook)|''Leia, Princess of Alderaan'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Leia Organa: Ordeal of the Princess]]''\n*[[Lost Stars (webcomic)|''Lost Stars'' webcomic]]\n*''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''\n*[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' novelization]]\n*[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (audiobook)|''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: A Junior Novel]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Rogue One: A Junior Novel (audiobook)|''Star Wars: Rogue One: A Junior Novel'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue One Graphic Novel Adaptation]]''\n*[[Rogue One Adaptation 6|''Rogue One Adaptation'' 6]]\n*''[[The Odyssey of Star Wars: An Epic Poem]]''\n*{{Shortstory|story=Raymus|book=From a Certain Point of View}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''\n*[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy (audiobook)|''A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy'' audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars: A New Hope (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: A New Hope'' junior novelization]]\n*{{Shortstory|story=The Bucket|book=From a Certain Point of View}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=By Whatever Sun|book=From a Certain Point of View}} {{Mo}}\n*[[From a Certain Point of View (audiobook)|''From a Certain Point of View'' audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel (audiobook)|''Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWE|characters|captainantilles|Captain Antilles}}\n*''[[Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]'' {{1stID|Raymus}}\n*{{SWCT|Captain Antilles - Tantive IV Captain - Base Series 1|Captain Antilles - ''Tantive IV'' Captain - ''Base Series 1''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Ships of the Galaxy]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|2|Databank A-Z|Alzoc III&ndash;Antilles}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|20|multiple=[[Helmets|Helmets: Rebel Trooper]];
