His [[Senate Head of Public Affairs Office|office]] was located on floor 391 of the [[Support Services Center]], [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], he was present during the [[Galactic City spaceport hostage siege]] as the media relations coordinator. He drew the ire of special security advisor [[Kal Skirata]], when he was overheard calling [[Clone commando/Legends|clone commando]], [[RC-8015|Fi]], a \"grunt\" shortly after Fi had saved their lives. Skirata confronted him about this but Rugeyan arrogantly dismissed him by saying that only the hostage Senator mattered. In response to this, Skirata physically grabbed him in the nether regions to get his full attention and insisted that he leave the incident scene, which Rugeyan quickly did.\n\nDespite this history, Rugeyan proved not to hold a grudge against Skirata and the [[Cuy'val Dar]]. [[21 BBY/Legends|A year later]], he was helpful when Skirata requested his cooperation during another [[Mission to Coruscant (Clone Wars)|anti-terror operation]] on Coruscant.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Omega Squad: Targets]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Republic Commando: Triple Zero]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rugeyan, Mar}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
