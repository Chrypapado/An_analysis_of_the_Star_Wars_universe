Ahuff was was willing to trade an [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] engine for it, but was duped by the scoundrel [[Skavak/Legends|Skavak]], who seduced his assistant [[Neva (Alderaanian)|Neva]] to convince to fake the result of genetic testing of Skavak's replica of the head. The day after Ahuff handed over the hyperdrive, he was brought the real head as well. [[Risha Drayen|Risha]] and [[Voidhound|her smuggler cohort]] needed the hyperdrive to beat Skavak, and had to convince Ahuff that he was conned.
