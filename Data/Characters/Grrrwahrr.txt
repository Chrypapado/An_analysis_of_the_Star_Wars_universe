Grrrwahrr then asks Revan to hunt down and kill the remaining Mandalorians. The player can accept or refuse this quest. Grrrwharr will angrily storm off if the latter choice is made.\n\n*If Revan did not have any medpacs in his inventory, and was not yet sufficiently trained to heal Grrrwahrr with the Force, Grrrwharr dies.\n\n===Dark Side Options===\n*Revan accuses Grrrwhahrr of being weak and refuses to help him, resulting in the Wookiee's death.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Grrrwahrr\n|pl=Grrrwahrr\n|ru=\u0413\u0440\u0440\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0440\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
