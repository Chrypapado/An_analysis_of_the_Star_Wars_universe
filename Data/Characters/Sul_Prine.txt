After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he owned a [[Sul Prine's Place|house]] near the city of [[Dearic]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> the technology-hating [[Meatlumps|Meatlump gang]] smashed several speeder bikes that were parked outside his house. He had known of them on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], but had never run into any on Talus before. Prine knew it was them because he found one of their typical jackets left behind and a map to one of their camps. When [[Vani Korr]], a [[Journalist/Legends|reporter]] with the ''[[Corellia Times]]'' who was investigating the Meatlumps learned of this attack, she asked an adventurer to look into it for her. Prine talked to the adventurer and gave the [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] the map he had found. Prine hoped that the adventurer would make them pay for the destroyed speeder bikes. The spacer did good use of the map and managed to find the location of the [[Meatlump Camps]] on Talus. The adventurer eventually attacked the camp, killing some Meatlumps in the process.<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSul Prine was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]].<ref name=\"SWG:TMHP3\" /> The game was shut down on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> He was added to the game with \"[[:w:c:swg:Chapter 10|Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King]]\", released on [[June 19]], [[2008]] as part of the quest that gave the player access to the [[:w:c:swg:Meatlumps Theme Park|Meatlumps Theme Park]], a series of quests for the Meatlumps.<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67812&month=062008|text=Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King|archivedate=20110924005831}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|The Meatlumps Hideout}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prine, Sul}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Racers]]\n[[Category:Talusians]]"}}}]}}}}
