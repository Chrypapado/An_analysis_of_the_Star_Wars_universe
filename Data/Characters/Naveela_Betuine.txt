Betuine was responsible for the concept and layout of the [[Millennial Celebration Invitation]] produced with final execution by [[Dashira Dobeq]] in preparation for the [[Millennium|millennial]] anniversary of the [[The galaxy|Galactic]] Republic. Due to Valorum's indecisiveness on what [[Gender|he]] wanted from the invitation, the design went through 250 revisions before the task of overseeing its design was delegated to [[Senator]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. Ultimately, the invitation was never distributed as the Republic was [[Proclamation of the New Order|reformed]] into the [[Galactic Empire]] before reaching the anniversary.<ref name=\"Propoganda\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNaveela Betuine was first mentioned in ''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]'', a reference book written by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] and released on [[October 25]], [[2016]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Naveela Betuine#kanon\n|fr=Naveela Betuine\n|ja=\u30ca\u30f4\u30a3\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30c8\u30a5\u30a4\u30f3\n|ru=\u041d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0438\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Betuine, Naveela}}\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Commenori]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Legislators and councilors]]"}}}]}}}}
