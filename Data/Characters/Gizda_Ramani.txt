Will you escort her?|Pooja Naberrie|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Gizda Ramani''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] from [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] who served as a [[Rebel pilot/Legends|pilot]] for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Sometime following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], [[Pooja Naberrie/Legends|Pooja Naberrie]] tasked a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] with locating Ramani and escorting her back to the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Dee'ja Peak/Legends|Dee'ja Peak]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. Although the spacer was attacked by [[Imperial Army trooper/Legends|Imperial Army troopers]], Naberrie's mission was completed.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGizda Ramani was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]], prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"AED\" /><ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref>\n\nPlayers who performed a series of [[W:c:swg:Quest|quests]] for [[W:c:swg:Pooja Naberrie|Pooja Naberrie]] had to locate Ramani and escort her safely back to [[W:c:swg:Dee'ja Peak|Dee'ja Peak]].<ref name=\"AED\" /> According to a forum guide on the official [[W:c:swg:Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided|''Star Wars Galaxies'']] discussion board, the quest to escort Ramani was bugged due to an inability to converse with the NPC. As a workaround, the guide recommended allowing the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Ramani, so that the player could advance to the next quest.<ref name=\"Rebel Quest Guide\">[http://www.swgemu.com/archive/scrapbookv51/data/20070130174548/ ''Rebel Quest Guide'' v1.01]</ref> This article does not assume this outcome to be [[canon]] in the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity, as Naberrie specifically requested that Ramani be safely escorted.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\nBecause Gizda Ramani spawned under the generic \"rebel_trooper\" template, her appearance was randomized under one of six possible depictions. She could appear as a female [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]], male Twi'lek, male [[Bith/Legends|Bith]], male [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustan]], Human male, or as a Human female. Because the [[W:c:swg:Quest|quest]] dialogue identified Ramani as a Human female, this article assumes that the Human female depiction is [[canon]] in the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity. The questline that involved Ramani was eventually removed from the game when Pooja Naberrie was relocated to [[Theed/Legends|Theed]] as part of the newly introduced [[W:c:swg:Legacy Quest|Legacy Quest]], released as part of [[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15 2005|Publish 25's]] [[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]] on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref name=\"AED\" /><ref name=\"NGE\">{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish 25 - ''Update Notes''|archivedate=20061119061153}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ramani, Gizda}}\n[[Category:Alliance Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
