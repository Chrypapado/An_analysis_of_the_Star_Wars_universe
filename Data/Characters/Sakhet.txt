Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], which saw the destruction of the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[superweapon]], the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], [[Luke Skywalker]] saved [[Sakhet's son|her son's]] life when two Imperial [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE Fighters]] attempted to [[Skirmish over Llanic|destroy]] his [[Starship|ship]] in the [[Llanic system]]. He brought a message to the Rebel Alliance from [[Drusil Bephorin]], who was a brilliant [[Givin]] cryptographer.\n\nBephorin stated that she would join the Rebels if they rescued her and her family. The Rebels sent [[Bren Derlin]] to rescue her family. Luke and [[Nakari Kelen]] [[Mission on Denon|traveled]] to the [[planet]] [[Denon]] where the cryptographer was under Imperial control. Sakhet was the contact who owned a [[Sakhet's Noodles|noodle hut]] on the planet.\n\nWhen they found the house, they ordered [[Corellian buckwheat noodles]] with [[nerf nugget]]s and [[onion]]s as well as with [[rancor sauce]], to signify their true intent. On the receipt for the food there was a message which read: Return omorrow at [[Standard hour|0900]]. The next morning, the two met with Sakhet and helped with food delivering and told which location will be visited by Bephorin. After some exculpation about if anything would go wrong, they decided to keep contact with the Kupohan spies. They were instructed to tell other Kupohan contacts that Sakhet that made the best nerf nuggets.<ref name=\"Heir to the Jedi\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Heir to the Jedi]]'' {{1st|[[Heir to the Jedi (audiobook)|''Heir to the Jedi'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Heir to the Jedi (audiobook)|''Heir to the Jedi'' audiobook]] {{1st|''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Agents of the Rebel Alliance]]\n[[Category:Alliance Intelligence members]]\n[[Category:Denon residents]]\n[[Category:Employees of Sakhet's Noodles]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Kupohans]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
