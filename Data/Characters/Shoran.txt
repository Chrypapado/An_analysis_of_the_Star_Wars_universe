Shoran was one of the main leaders in the [[Alaris Prime colonial war|colonization]] of the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Alaris Prime/Legends|Alaris Prime]], where he, Chewbacca and Attichitcuk fought the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] for the rights to the world. He met up with Chewbacca [[Standard year/Legends|years]] [[4 ABY/Legends|later]] and worked with him and his [[Human/Legends|Human]] friend [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] to [[Liberation of Kashyyyk (Galactic Civil War)|free]] their homeworld from the grip of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Shoran later joined with Chewbacca and several other Wookiees [[Black Fleet Crisis|one last time]] to free Solo from the starship [[Intimidator (Executor-class)|''Pride of Yevetha'']]. Shoran was killed during this mission.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family===\nShoran, whose name meant \"fierce craftsman\" in [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]],<ref name=\"GCG\">''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] born into a prominent extended [[Attichitcuk's family|family]]. His uncle was the [[Wookiee Chieftain|Chieftain]] [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]], making Shoran the cousin of his [[Parent/Legends|son]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]. He was also the cousin of the Wookiees [[Jowdrrl]] and [[Dryanta]].<ref name=\"TT\" />\n\n===Colonizing Alaris Prime===\n{{Quote|Shoran has gone on ahead, but don't worry, he left markers so we could find him in this wilderness.|Qui-Gon Jinn transmitting to Chewbacca|Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds}}\n[[File:Chewie_and_Shoran.png|thumb|left|200px|Shoran and Chewbacca near a marker on Alaris Prime]]\nBetween [[39 BBY/Legends|39]] and [[36 BBY/Legends|36 BBY]],<ref>''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' places the [[Alaris Prime colonial war]] during this period.</ref> Shoran was one of the first Wookiees to land on the [[Discovery of Alaris Prime|rediscovered]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]], [[Alaris Prime/Legends|Alaris Prime]]. Shoran landed on the world at the same time as his cousin Chewbacca, but went and scouted ahead, leaving several [[marker]]s for Chewbacca to follow. Chewbacca followed the path Shoran had left with the help of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], who was sent to aid in the colonization. When his cousin caught up with him, Shoran said that there was an unusual structure ahead. The structure was in fact a [[Power core/Legends|power core]] built by the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]], a company that was illegally trying to colonize Alaris Prime, that had been damaged by [[Gundark/Legends|gundarks]], a major predator on Alaris Prime. Qui-Gon suggested that the Wookiees should destroy the power core as it was a hazard, which the two did. Shoran and Chewbacca then continued on the path until they reached the camp already built by [[Attichitcuk/Legends|Attichitcuk]], Chewbacca's father. Upon their arrival the Wookiees had to defend the [[Attichitcuk's camp|camp]] from attacking gundarks, which they successfully did. The Wookiees then continued preparing to transport more Wookiees to Alaris Prime.<ref name=\"SW:GB\" />\n\nWhen the Wookiees made plans to exterminate the gundarks, they [[Skirmish at the gundark nest|encountered]] [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] from the Trade Federation, revealing their competing presence. Shoran established a walled [[Shoran's camp|camp]] and with Jinn's help established trade routes with [[Chewbacca's camp]] using [[Corellian HoverFreighter]]s. Shoran found a [[Jedi holocron (Alaris Prime)|Jedi holocron]] in his camp and informed Jinn, who asked Chewbacca to have his workers build a [[Jedi temple (Alaris Prime)|Jedi temple]]. After the construction Jinn sent his [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to retrieve the holocron from Shoran's camp. Shoran then spotted a Trade Federation strike force sent by the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[LUH-989]] heading for Chewbacca's camp, which he warned Jinn and Chewbacca of. The attackers were [[Attack on Chewbacca's camp|destroyed]] by Chewbacca's soldiers, and Shoran requested 100 [[Nova crystal/Legends|nova crystals]] to recover from the attack, which Chewbacca gave in thanks for his warning. In return Shoran sent 100 units of [[Ore/Legends|ore]].<ref name=\"SW:GB\" />\n\n[[Scout/Legends|Scouts]] from Shoran's camp then discovered a [[Trade Federation listening array|listening array]] belonging to the Trade Federation. Combined with forces from Chewbacca's camp, Shoran participated in the [[Attack on the Trade Federation listening array|attack]] on it which destroyed all the droids guarding the base's transmitters, which included [[B1-Series battle droid]]<nowiki/>s, [[beetle droid]]s and [[P-series destroyer droid|destroyer droids]]. Afterwards, Chewbacca planned to remove the Trade Federation from Alaris Prime completely, setting up at a new [[Unidentified Wookiee base (fortress)|base]]. Shoran began construction of the base's walls, which Chewbacca's workers completed. The Wookiee [[Army/Legends|army]], which included Attichitcuk and Jinn, razed the [[Unidentified Trade Federation base|Trade Federation's base]] and its fortress, in the [[Battle for Alaris Prime]], which secured the moon for the Wookiees.<ref name=\"SW:GB\" />\n\n===Liberation of Kashyyyk===\nDuring the [[Liberation of Kashyyyk (Galactic Civil War)|liberation]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] many [[Standard year/Legends|years]] [[4 ABY/Legends|later]], Shoran met [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and Chewbacca in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Chenachochan]] after they escaped from a trap set by [[Weebacca]]. Shoran helped them destroy three [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] transmission jammers.\n\n===Black Fleet Crisis===\n{{Expandsect}}\nIn [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], during the [[Black Fleet Crisis]], Shoran died during the rescue of Han Solo from the [[Intimidator (Executor-class)|''Pride of Yevetha'']].<ref name=\"TT\" /> Shoran's death was one of the examples given why Solo didn't want Chewbacca's life debt to continue through Jowdrrl and Dryanta in [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]].<ref>''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nShoran first appeared in the [[1996]] book of ''[[The Black Fleet Crisis]]'' trilogy, ''[[Tyrant's Test]]''. He played a role in both the Attichitcuk and Chewbacca campaigns in the [[2001]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]''. The campaigns were later included in the game's [[2002]] expansion pack, [[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns|''Clone Campaigns'']].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Shoran}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns]]''\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*''[[Tyrant's Test]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|9|CHE10, ''Chewbacca''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Shoran\n|es=Shoran\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Members of the First Wookiee Expeditionary Force]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
