However, he and his infant son Jonash disappeared in a pirate raid, leaving Tiion, and subsequently her son [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]], as his only acknowledged heirs.\n\nHowever, Jonash Solo was believed to have survived to become Han Solo's father. True, Han's son [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] would later dismiss Den's grandson Thrackan&mdash;who by this analysis would have been his own first cousin once removed&mdash;as simply a \"distant\" cousin, but Han was always reluctant to discuss his origins, and Jacen's opinion may say more about attitudes within the [[House of Solo]] than the actual blood relationships involved.\n\nIf this identification is correct, then Den Solo may in fact have been the public identity of [[Dalla Solo|Dalla the Black]], a notorious pirate and kidnapper, and possible claimant to the Corellian throne, who was also identified as Han's paternal grandfather. Circumstantial support for the identification of the two men is provided by the role played by pirates in Den's disappearance, and by Dalla's known use of false names to disguise his true identity, but categorical proof of whether the equation is correct or not is currently lacking.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon (audiobook)|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{1stID}}\n*''[[The Courtship of Princess Leia]]'' {{1stID|Dalla Solo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Union]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Ylesia]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Den Solo\n|ru=\u0414\u0435\u043d \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Solo, Den}}\n[[Category:House of Solo]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tralusians]]"}}}]}}}}
