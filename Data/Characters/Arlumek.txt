After brief negotiations, Boulad decided to hand over the information to the Captain for payment of 5,000 credits, as it was no problem for him to infiltrate the Empire's central computer and records and obtain records that would be unattainable to normal living beings. Based on this information, Typho realized that Darth Vader was responsible for the death of [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and left the caragmoloid again.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Arlumek#legends\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Cragmoloids]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
