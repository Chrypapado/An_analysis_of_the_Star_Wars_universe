During the elections in Bestine between [[Sean Trenwell]] and [[Victor Visalis]], Orqiti encountered a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who she mistook as an individual interested in collecting influx capacitors. After listening to the Jawa for clarification, she learned that the spacer was not the one she was waiting for. Nonetheless, she used the chance to encourage the spacer to vote for Sean Trenwell as Bestine's [[Director of Commerce]] so that the marketplace in the city could thrive.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOrqiti Aneofo was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. She often appeared next to a Jawa in the Bestine marketplace, and would encourage players to vote for Sean Trenwell.

However, the randomly generated name, Orqiti Aneofo, appeared in the ''Star Wars Galaxies'' Friday Feature named [https://web.archive.org/web/20080620033130/http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/en_US/players/content.vm?page=Bestine%20Politics&resource=features Bestine Politics: Political Intrigue in Bestine].
