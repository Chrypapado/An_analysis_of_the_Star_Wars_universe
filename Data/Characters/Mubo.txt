One such droid was the [[pilot droid]] RX-24, which he purchased from [[Savi & Son Salvage]] and repurposed into a [[DJ]], named [[R-3X]], to perform at [[Oga's Cantina]]. [[Oga Garra]], the proprietor of the [[cantina]] and ruler of Black Spire Outpost, considered the droid as payment of Mubo's debts, allowing the Utai to become the only person in the settlement to have fully paid Garra his dues.<ref name=\"GEstaff\">[[Droid Depot]] has backstory elements that, though not directly published for the public, are officially [[canon]] details that can be obtained verbally from cast members working in the store.</ref>\n\nMubo also reprogrammed the pitmaster droid, [[8D-J8]], for [[Bakkar]], owner of the [[Ronto Roasters]] restaurant. 8D-J8's job was to turn the spit, though he had aspirations of becoming a master chef.
