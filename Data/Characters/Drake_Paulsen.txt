Drake was himself a pirate and [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], which he had been doing since his father brought him along on a smuggling run at the age of five. He was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], but untrained in any way of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. He had [[Color/Legends|brown]] hair, a deeply tanned skin, and blue eyes, and wore a large golden earring.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Drake.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Drake Paulsen with Taggert and Coynite Tra'Parr'Sratt.]]\n\nAt the age of fifteen, the Socorran [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] crimelord [[Abdi-Badawzi]] forced Drake into accompanying the alcoholic [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] smuggler [[Elias Halbert]] and the honorable [[Coynite/Legends|Coynite]] warrior [[Tra'Parr'Sratt]] on a gunrun aboard the ''[[Seldom Different]]''. They were intercepted by an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] customs force led by [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Taggert]]. While managing to hide the cargo, Drake was fired upon and injured by one of the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] that made up the boarding party, as he tried to prevent Taggert from executing Sratt, whom Taggert was intent on making an example out of. As the ''Seldom Different'' checked out clear, Taggert decided to let the Corellian, his ship, and his passengers go. This was Drake's first encounter with the Empire. Sratt nursed Drake until they made it back to Socorro, and Drake could finally be reunited with his father.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|2|Out of the Cradle}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|3|When the Domino Falls}}\n*{{Journal|5|A Bitter Winter}}\n*{{Journal|12|Idol Intentions}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Black Sands of Socorro]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paulsen, Drake}}\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]\n[[Category:Socorrans]]"}}}]}}}}
