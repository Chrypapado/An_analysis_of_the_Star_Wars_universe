When the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] exile [[Meetra Surik]] came to Nar Shaddaa searching for the missing [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], Fassa asked her to help assign three freighters their ID signatures, and later aided her by transporting the refugee [[Kahranna]]'s family to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Telos IV|Telos]] and possibly hiring the veteran [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Odis]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nFassa was originally planned to be a [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]], there are cut audio files in the game with all of Fassa's lines spoken with a Toydarian voice. It is unknown why the developers chose to replace the original Fassa with a Twi'lek and his voice-over with generic Twi'lek sounds. Fassa appears as a [[Toydarian/Legends|Toydarian]] in the Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords restored content mod.\n\nOriginally, Fassa was voiced by [[Andrew Secombe]], who was the voice of [[Watto/Legends|Watto]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] and has played other [[Toydarian]]s.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fassa\n|nl=Fassa\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Rutian Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
