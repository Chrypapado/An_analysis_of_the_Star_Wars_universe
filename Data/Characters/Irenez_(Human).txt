Alongside her counterpart [[Sena Leikvold Midanyl|Sena]] she served as Bel Iblis' chief advisor. An attractive woman with short gray hair, she was middle aged by the time that [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] met her at the base.\n\n==Biography==\nIrenez's association with [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Garm Bel Iblis|Bel Iblis]] began when he financed her education at the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]]. Following her graduation, she refused to join the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], instead she formed her own platoon of [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] and soldiers, remaining neutral between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]]. However, after Bel Iblis went into hiding following an Imperial assassination attempt on [[Anchoron]], Irenez would join [[Garm Bel Iblis's movement|his movement]] to lead his ground forces.\n\nIn [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]] she was responsible for securing the secret meetings of [[Tav Breil'lya]] and Garm Bel Iblis on [[New Cov/Legends|New Cov]]. Due to her picket lines Han Solo was intercepted when he tried to tail Breil'lya, as did [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] when he arrived on New Cov to meet Solo. When Imperial forces [[Raid on New Cov|raided]] Ilic to obtain drugs and medicines&mdash;a cover for the city's clandestine payments to the Empire&mdash;Irenez was ordered to help them return to their ships.\n\nWhen Solo and Calrissian came to ''Peregrine's Nest'', Irenez asked them to try to engineer a request from [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] for a formal invitation to join the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], as she knew that Mothma was not seeking power for herself, and that Bel Iblis was too proud to go asking for an invitation. Irenez joined the New Republic with the rest of Bel Iblis' former forces.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising (comics)|''Dark Force Rising'' comic adaptation]]\n*''[[The Last Command]]''\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|sena|Midanyl, Sena Leikvold|archivedate=20100730095637}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
