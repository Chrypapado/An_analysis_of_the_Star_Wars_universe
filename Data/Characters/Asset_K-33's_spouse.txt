Unbeknownst to K-33's spouse, K-33 was an [[Imperial Agent]] who had used her to get into the Kuat family to get more power. K-33 started shuttling to the [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]] very regularly, sometimes for several days at a time. This put strain on the relationship between K-33 and the family. K-33's spouse confided deep concerns regarding K-33's ambitions to close relatives. K-33 took up permanent residence in the [[Kuat Drive Yards Governor Quarters]], abandoning their spouse. K-33 took control of the Kuat Drive Yards security. K-33 made a transmission to [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Zasha Ranken]] of the [[Imperial Navy (Sith Empire)|Imperial Armada]] suggesting that a [[Kuat Defensive Station|single defensive station]] was key to subverting all Kuat Drive Yards security protocols. The [[Battle of Kuat (Galactic War)|Battle for Kuat]] soon followed.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/blog/20140117|text=RE: Kuat Drive Yards}} {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Kuati]]\n[[Category:Unidentified spouses]]"}}}]}}}}
