In addition, he was a crack shot, as his gunnery skills were able to produce \"devastating results.\"\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Chewbacca_TCG_2016_Store_Championship_Kit_Card.png|thumb|left|180px|Chewbacca tosses Watts overboard]]\nWatts served under [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Marquand]] as the gunner of [[Tempest Scout 2]] during the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. When [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and two [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] landed on [[Tempest Scout 2]], Marquand ordered Watts to get the only Ewok he was aware of off their AT-ST. Watts peered out of the cockpit hatchway and was pulled out by the powerful Chewbacca, who threw him overboard, screaming during most of his 8.6-meter plummet to the ground. The Imperials, not knowing about his demise, later believed that Watts, alongside Marquand, had turned traitor when it became apparent that their walker was committing turncoat actions against them.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWatts was played by his namesake, ''Return of the Jedi'' co-producer [[Robert Watts]]. Watts served in real-world armed forces, during which he obtained the rank of lieutenant.<ref name=\"SWI 101\">{{InsiderCite|101|Watts the Story?}}</ref> The character was originally supposed to be [[General/Legends|General]] [[Maximilian Veers/Legends|Maximilian Veers]], and [[Julian Glover]] was invited to reprise his role from [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']].
