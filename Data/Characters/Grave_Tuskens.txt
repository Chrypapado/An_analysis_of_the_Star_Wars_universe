Originally, the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Maw (Dark Jedi)|Maw]] used the Grave Tuskens as a personal strike force.\n\n==Purpose==\nNo one knows how Maw gained the services of the Grave Tuskens. What is known is that they were taken from their home on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and trained to be Maw's personal strike force. They were only a few hundred in number and strangely, they were trained in the use of modified (so as to be easier to use for weaker beings) [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Bowcaster/Legends|bowcasters]]. Maw used them to plunder artifacts from the tombs of both light and dark Jedi, which was how they earned their grisly name.\n\nWhen Maw joined [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]] on his search for the [[Valley of the Jedi]], the Grave Tuskens were stationed on [[Sulon]] at the insistence of [[Boc Aseca|Boc]], who felt that \"something wasn't right.\" They roamed the wastelands outside of [[Barons Hed]]. Boc was correct, but didn't find out until much later when [[8t88/Legends|8t88]] and [[Yun]] reported that [[Morgan Katarn]]'s son had come after them, cutting a swath through the Tuskens as he went.\n\nThe survivors of Sulon found their way off the agricultural moon, and, finding their master [[Death/Legends|dead]], became rare and sought after [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] and bodyguards for crimelords all over the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].\n\n[[Rogg]] became the Grave Tusken leader in [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], with [[Bordo]] being his second-in-command. Both were killed in an incident in [[5 ABY/Legends|5 ABY]] involving also [[Kyle Katarn]] and [[WeeGee]], along with their employers, leaving the Grave Tusken leadership in doubt.\n\n==Apparel==\nTheir uniforms were different from the traditional cloth wrappings of the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]], being bluish gray uniforms or sandy brown armor. Their masks only covered half their faces which defied the traditional law of the [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Sand People]] not to show skin, resulting in being banned or beaten to death if doing so.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTusken warriors appear in [[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith|''Mysteries of the Sith'']] in and around [[Ka'Pa's palace]]. They are identical to the Grave Tuskens of ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'' (they are seemingly based on the same CGI model) and also carry bowcasters. It is never clear, however, whether these are indeed Grave Tuskens or ordinary Tusken Raiders, since it is never clear what planet [[Ka'Pa]]'s operations are based on.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast]]'', the [[Weequay/Legends|Weequay]] mercenaries fight in the same style as these warriors. They even wear the same style of armor.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Forces: Rebel Agent]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/89/indexp3.html|text=Underworld Appendix: Swoops, Spice, and Wretched Rogues|int=Underworld Appendix: Swoops, Spice, and Wretched Rogues}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/barely-tolerable-alien-henchmen-of-the-empire-part-2|text=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire, Part 2|int=Barely Tolerable: Alien Henchmen of the Empire}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435\u043d\u044b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Sulonese]]\n[[Category:Swoop gangs]]\n[[Category:Tusken Raider groups]]"}}}]}}}}
