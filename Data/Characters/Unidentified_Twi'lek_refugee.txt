He warned her not to trust her companion, [[Atton Rand]], claiming that they had crossed paths before during the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Civil War [[Standard year/Legends|years]] earlier. He told her that Rand had come to Nar Shaddaa claiming to be a refugee of the war, and informed Surik that Rand was a murderer, as opposed to a soldier. Surik was skeptical, but the Twi'lek stated that she could believe him or not. He had warned her about Rand and left the rest up to her. Surik would later use that information to confront Rand, who admitted to murdering Jedi for the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] during the Jedi Civil War.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> Surik forgave Rand and offered to train him in the ways of the Jedi, which he accepted, becoming a [[Jedi Sentinel/Legends|Jedi Sentinel]].<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|148|Jedi Exile}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThe Twi'lek had [[Color/Legends|orange]] skin and blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and did not speak [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Galactic Basic Standard]], though he understood it.
