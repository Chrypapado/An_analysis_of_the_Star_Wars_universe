A [[Prince/Legends|princess]] of the [[Fel dynasty]] founded by [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Jagged Fel]], she was the daughter of Emperor [[Roan Fel]] and Empress [[Elliah Fel]]. Fel was also a member of the [[Imperial Knight]]s, trained in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by [[Elke Vetter]]. Despite her father's objections, Fel shared a close relationship with [[Antares Draco]], a fellow Knight and supporter of the Imperial family.\n\nThough Fel was heir to the [[Throne/Legends|throne]], she was forced into hiding as a result of the [[One Sith]] coup that made [[Darth Krayt]] the new Emperor in opposition to Fel's claim and that of her father. As Krayt consolidated the [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|New Galactic Empire]], he deployed his [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]], [[Darth Talon]], to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the princess. However, Fel was saved by [[Cade Skywalker]], a former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]-turned-[[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. Joining her father and his [[Empire-in-exile|government-in-exile]] on [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]], Fel worked towards toppling the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Politics/Legends|regime]] and regaining the Empire that once belonged to her family.\n\nAided by a [[Galactic Alliance Remnant|remnant]] of the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]] as well as the [[New Jedi Order]], the Fel faction invaded the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], defeating the Sith forces and reclaiming the [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]]. However, Roan Fel was killed during the [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|Battle of Coruscant]], and with Krayt's death by Skywalker's hand, Marasiah Fel acceded to the throne as Empress. She formed an alliance with Galactic Alliance [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[K'Kruhk]] in an effort to promote peace. Together they formed a new government, the [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]], after which Fel endorsed the [[G51 communications array]] project to link the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] with the greater galaxy. She also initiated a campaign to hunt the remaining Sith and their supporters, intending to put them on trial for war crimes. During the [[Battle of the Floating World]], the Empress led her forces to victory over the remnants of Krayt's Sith Order.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Empire's princess===\n{{Quote|That's the former Princess Marasiah Fel&mdash;snarky attitude and all!|[[Deliah Blue]]|Legacy (2006) 3}}\nMarasiah Fel was the daughter of [[Roan Fel]], the third [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] of the [[Fel Empire]]. Some [[Moff/Legends|Moffs]] made no secret of their doubts about a woman being in line to take the throne, but like her father, Princess Marasiah was trained as an [[Imperial Knight]], although she had not received a formal knighting when [[Darth Krayt]] and [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Morlish Veed]] began their machinations to seize control of the Empire. By the time of the [[Attack on Emperor Fel]] in [[130 ABY]], Marasiah was already secreted away on [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]]. Marasiah acted as an emissary between her father and Imperial [[Star system/Legends|systems]], often infiltrating [[Planet/Legends|planets]] in secret in order to determine the loyalty of the officers governing there. Due to her work, Fel became fluent in several languages including [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], [[Bocce/Legends|Bocce]], [[High Galactic/Legends|High Galactic]] and [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\">''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n===Hunted by the Sith===\n{{Quote|I will not allow you to kill another who has risen in my defense!

[[Duel on Socorro|Beating]] Vetter in one-on-one [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]], Talon tortured the Imperial Knight before finally killing her with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]. Princess Marasiah felt the death of her instructor and friend through [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and was torn between seeking revenge for Elke's death and escaping to continue and banned with her mission. Sia was personally troubled that one of her mentors had laid down her life for her. She did not realize that she was of little importance to the One Sith, who merely saw her as a way to find her father.<ref name=\"leg2\" />\n\nThe path of Sia and Astraal's escape led them to the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']] and [[Cade Skywalker]]. She demanded immediate passage and promised to reimburse them in return for their services. But the bounty hunter wanted [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] up front, so Sia \"[[Mind trick/Legends|ordered]]\" him but it didn't work as he was once a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. But at the sight of the Sith, Cade initiated emergency take-off procedures and blasted off Socorro. The two women hoped to make a rendezvous with Astraal's brother [[Shado Vao|Shado]] on [[Vendaxa/Legends|Vendaxa]], but the self-serving Cade had other ideas, specifically the bounty on Marasiah and her father's heads, planning on delivering her to her father and then sell their hideaway to the Sith.<ref name=\"leg3\">[[Legacy (2006) 3|''Legacy'' (2006) 3]]</ref>\n\n===Fight for survival===\n{{Quote|I envy you your freedom but I'm not walking away from my responsibilities.

The timely arrival of Shado Vao and [[Wolf Sazen]] stopped the animal, and Sia made arrangements to travel with the two Jedi. And she already guessed that the pirates knew her identity. She was willing to give them creds for transfer into their accounts&mdash;once she and the Jedi have left Vendexa and them. But a sudden attack by Darth Talon prevented them from escaping, and Marasiah confronted the Sith before she could kill Wolf Sazen. Her attempt at revenge for the murder of her master, Elke Vetter, was short-lived, as Talon [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force push|Force pushed]] her away easily. Cade Skywalker intervened, throwing Talon into the forest with the Force, and led the party to the ''Mynock'', but the ship had been sabotaged by Talon prior to her attack, stranding them on Vendaxa.<ref name=\"leg5\">[[Legacy (2006) 5|''Legacy'' (2006) 5]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Felkickcade.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aided by Cade Skywalker, a former Jedi apprentice, Fel confronted the Sith who pursued her.]]\nWhile waiting for repairs on the ''Mynock'', it was revealed to her that Cade was a Skywalker. She approached him about the subject and told him how she wished she could just disappear from her destiny too. But she also told him that she would not run away from her responsibilities.<ref name=\"leg5\" /> When Imperial Knights arrived they were shot down, but survived the crash. Marasiah joined the other knights in the fight along with Cade. Marasiah condemned [[Antares Draco]] during their fight with the Sith for coming, knowing that [[Roan Fel|her father]] would never send a rescue mission. When Draco confessed his love for her she told him, \"I know.\"<ref name=\"leg6\">[[Legacy (2006) 6|''Legacy'' (2006) 6]]</ref>\n\nShe saved Cade's life when he was in a daze and failed to notice a Sith approaching him. Marasiah cut down the Sith, but not without injury. When Cade, holding her injured form in his arms, asked her why she did it, she said, \"Told you&hellip; had to make it right&hellip; even if it's only&hellip; one&hellip; life&hellip;\" She then fell silent. Cade called her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to him using the Force. Igniting it, he proclaimed \"I have had enough.\" Marasiah just barely survived the encounter, and afterwards the Imperial Knights and the Jedi brought her board the ''Mynock'' at Cade's request, Cade used his [[Dark transfer|power that heals people close to death]] on her, bringing her back from the brink of death. She was then escorted back to Bastion onboard the ''Mynock''.<ref name=\"leg7\">[[Legacy (2006) 7|''Legacy'' (2006) 7]]</ref>\n\n===A knight of the Empire===\n{{Quote|I know the feelings you have for me&mdash;as well as your sense of duty. And thus, you're conflicted. I am not. I have no intention of letting my father run my personal life.|Marasiah Fel, to Antares Draco|Legacy (2006) 23}}\n[[File:MarasiahAndAntares-SWLEG23.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Fel cultivated a relationship with Antares Draco despite her father's disapproval.]]\nSometime after this, Marasiah completed her training and was formally knighted as an Imperial Knight. After being charged with a mission by her father, Sia met with Antares at the [[Pellaeon Gardens]]. Antares had been distancing himself from her ever since they returned to Bastion, and Marasiah knew her father had ordered him to do so. She told Antares that she would not allow her father to run her personal life, and showed him that she reciprocated his love by kissing him. Antares sadly said he wasn't sure if they could be together, but Sia confidently said they could.\n\nThe Knights were sent to find Skywalker before he fell into the Sith's clutches again. They were contacted by a fellow Knight, [[Azlyn Rae]], who was once a Jedi, relaying information about the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order's]] [[Hidden Temple]]. Sia personally knew Azlyn and was confident her loyalty would be to the Empire rather than to the Jedi. If not, the Imperial Knights would be able to weed out traitors.\n\nFel, along with Draco and Krieg, would later be present in the Hidden Temple as Cade Skywalker met the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi High Council]]. She and the other knights were treated with distrust by the Jedi, due to Roan Fel's involvement in the [[Sith\u2013Imperial War]]. Marasiah then told the Jedi High Council that it was in fact the Sith who had orchestrated the aforementioned events, including tampering with the [[Ossus Project]]. After this statement, Marasiah asked the Jedi High Council to join their forces with the Empire's. The Jedi then told her that they would consider her offer. She then conversed with the other Imperial Knights about Skywalker's plan to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] Krayt. She figured they could convince him to join them with bribery.\n\nLater, Marasiah had a discussion with Azlyn, who was torn between her past as a Jedi and her duty as a Knight. Sia reminded her of the oaths she swore for life as well as warning her of the fate of the only Imperial Knight who broke his vows.\n\nThe next day, Sia and the others were witness via hologram to the Council's decision; they wished to pursue negotiations with her father but rejected Cade Skywalker's proposal of assassination. Sia stayed behind to continue diplomacy while she sent her fellow Knights to accompany Skywalker.\n\nSia later was present on Agamar when the Jedi Council accepted to discuss alliance with her father. However, the meeting was [[Operation: Thunderstroke|intercepted]] by the Sith. Though Emperor Fel managed to escape, Sia was captured and taken to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. There, she unsuccessfully tried to convince Moff [[Rulf Yage]] to help her escape and defect. She was then taken by [[Darth Havok]], a [[Sith Inquisitor]] ordered to take Sia to [[Korriban]].\n\n===Imprisonment on Korriban===\n{{Quote|I will not break, I will not bend, I will not serve.|Marasiah Fel, to Darth Havok|Legacy (2006) 49}}\n[[File:ChamberofPersuasion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fel was captured and tortured by the Sith until Draco rescued her.]]\nPrincess Fel was taken to [[XoXaan's Temple]]'s [[Chambers of Persuasion]], where she was [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] and interrogated by Lord Havok. She resisted Havok's torture, which included Force lightning attacks, and refused to talk, prompting the Inquisitor to reveal his former identity: Eshkar Niin, the former Master of Antares. Sia was shocked to see Niin alive since Draco claimed to have killed him. Havok said that Draco lied, making Sia believe that her love was really in league with the Sith. Sia quickly recovered from her shock, and using telekinesis, she took Havok's lightsaber and attempted to silence herself. But Havok managed to overpower her and take the weapon from her hands.<ref name=\"leg49\">[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]]</ref>\n\nSoon after, Draco, Krieg and Shado Vao arrived to [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|rescue]] Sia. They found her in Havok's torture chamber, where they killed the guards and freed her. When Sia recovered and found herself in Draco's arms, she lashed out at him, calling him a traitor. She raged at a shocked Draco that he was ordered to kill Niin for deserting the Imperial Knights. Draco insisted that he had, but Sia told him that Niin was now Darth Havok and that he had personally tortured her. The argument was cut short by more Sith guards, and Sia took up a lightsaber to help make their escape.\n\nThe four managed to get to a landing pad where a shuttle was docked. When the path was clear, Draco told the others to leave while he held the Sith off. When Sia heard this, she realized that Havok had lied and Draco wasn't in league with the Sith. She protested Draco's decision, begging him not to stay behind, but he had accepted that he may have to give his life to protect her. Sia still didn't want to leave Draco behind, and Krieg had to restrain Sia to get her on the shuttle. Sometime after the shuttle took off, Sia and Krieg thought they felt Draco die at Havok's hands.\n\n===Forging an alliance===\n[[File:Guesswhoscomingtodinner.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Accompanied by the Imperial Knights, Fel sought out the Jedi Order to propose n alliance against the One Sith.]]\nSome time after her rescue from Korriban Marasiah was escorted to the hidden Temple on Taivas by Wolf Sazen. There she was reunited with a recently recovered Antares Draco who had just spent a length of time being tortured by his former master at the very place he had rescued her from. Though she was happy he was alive she was displeased that he had revealed Imperial secrets instead of killing himself. Still she had him given armor and informed him he could regain his honor by fighting in the coming attack.\n\nAs the Sith [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|assaulted]] Taivas, the GAR, Fel and Jedi forces attempted to entrap Krayt. But the Dark Lord had one card to play: [[Darth Krayt's Sith trooper|Sith troopers]] piloting [[Annihilator-class starfighter]]s, turning the tide of the battle. The allies were then forces to flee as Tr'a Saa sacrificed herself to enable their escape.\n\n===Long live the Empress===\n{{Quote|Do this and you become Krayt! You embody the Force, father! This is wrong! You must see that!|Marasiah Fel, to Roan Fel|Legacy\u2014War 6}}\n[[File:FelFuneral.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marasiah Fel succeeded her father, who died during the Battle of Coruscant, becoming Empress of the restored Empire.]]\nFel's father soon made the decision to take the fight to Krayt on Coruscant directly rather than wait for him to attack Bastion. As the assault began, the Emperor had Fel, Treis and Draco by his side, stating that he needs those of absolute loyalty. When the battle went awry with Krayt deploying the Sith troopers once again, Roan Fel made the decision to deploy a toxin created by a captive [[Darth Maladi]] as a last resort. Fel and the others protested his hasty decision, for he would be condemning their allies and billions of innocents on the planet to death. However, Fel's father, too immersed in the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], Force-pushed Fel and Treis against a wall, stating that deploying the toxin would be better than handing over [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] to Krayt. Weakly, Fel tried to remind her father that he embodied the Force and was close to becoming like Krayt, and begged Draco to keep her father from using the toxin. Draco's recent experiences had made him realize what being an Imperial Knight meant, and declared that he would uphold his oath: to bring his Emperor back to the light side of the Force or kill him. The furious Emperor began to duel Draco. In the midst of it, they felt Krayt finally die at the hands of Cade but Roan refused to believe it. He was close to releasing the poison, unaware that he was in fact playing along with Krayt's plans, for the poison wouldn't affect the Sith. However, Draco ran the Emperor through from behind, killing him.\n\n===Building a triumvirate===\n{{Quote|The point is the investment. We're investing in the future of this government.''\"<br />\"''We're investing in window dressing, not solid statecraft&hellip; your communications array is a perfect example.|Marasiah Fel and Gar Stazi|Legacy (2013) 1}}\n[[File:Galactic_Triumvirate_meeting.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Galactic Federation Triumvirate was led by Empress Marasiah Fel, Admiral Gar Stazi, and Jedi Master K'Kruhk.]]\nAfter Darth Krayt's [[Death/Legends|death]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord's]] [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Sith Empire]] [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|collapsed]] and the remaining members of the [[One Sith]] fled into hiding. Roan Fel was celebrated as a hero who died to liberate the galaxy; the details of his fall to the dark side were covered up. With the death of her father, Marasiah Fel ascended as the first [[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] of the Empire. As the Galaxy became united under the rule of the newly-formed [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]], its first triumvirs consisted of Empress Fel, [[Gar Stazi|Admiral Gar Stazi]] and [[K'Kruhk|Jedi Master K'Kruhk]].<ref name=\"LegacyW6\" /> Almost one year after Darth Krayt's demise, Marasiah Fel (with the approval of K'kruhk and Gar Stazi, although unwillingly) decided to implement a galactic [[G51 communications array]] in order to connect the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] systems to the galaxy. To this end, she sent one of her Imperial Knights, [[Yalta Val]], to the [[Carreras system]] in order to activate the array. However, Val was ambushed by the rogue Sith [[Darth Wredd]], who wanted to destroy the One Sith and re-institute the [[Rule of Two/Legends|Rule of Two]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2.1\">[[Legacy (2013) 1|''Legacy'' (2013) 1]]</ref>\n\nYalta Val's disappearance worried the Imperial Knight [[Jao Assam]], who raised his concerns with Empress Fel, explaining that Master Val would have used his [[Unidentified Imperial communications droid|Imperial comm droid]] to transmit his coordinates. While Empress Fel was worried, she took the view that construction delays were not unheard off. Suspecting that something bad had befallen Master Val, Jao offered to travel to the Carreras system to investigate. Empress Fel declined his request and reiterated that his orders were to oversee the Ithorian link of the communications array in the [[Ottega system/Legends|Ottega system]]. When Jao disagreed, she reminded him that she was in charge. In the end, Jao appeared to comply and promised to ensured that the Ithorian link of the array was finished on time.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.2\">[[Legacy (2013) 2|''Legacy'' (2013) 2]]</ref> In the end, Assam disobeyed his orders and traveled to the Carreras system to investigate Val's whereabouts.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.3\">[[Legacy (2013) 3|''Legacy'' (2013) 3]]</ref>\n\nUnaware of Jao's intentions, Marasiah Fel conversed with her lover Antares Draco, who described Jao as being rash but having good instincts. He expressed concerns about the lack of communications from Val. Empress Fel commented that navigating through the Carreras system was tricky and that they had to give Val time to do his job. Draco explained that the Imperial Knights faced a shortage of skilled warriors and reiterated that the Order could not afford to lose more Knights. Fel replied that the galaxy could never find out about this shortage and emphasized that the Imperial Knights represented the Galactic Triumvirate. Fel expressed her frustrations about trying to make Master K'Kruhk and Admiral Stazi understand that the Triumvirate was committed to keeping its promises to the galaxy. She commented that the Knights could never afford to look weak. Draco then assured her that she was strong and that they would prevail through this test.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.2\" />\n\nAfter taking control of the [[Carreras G51 communications array]], Darth Wredd broadcast his manifesto to the galaxy, in which he derided the Empress for having no real power. Empress Fel watched Wredd's broadcast and was horrified to see that Yalta had been taken captive. Darth Wredd then attempted to execute Yalta before a life audience but was stopped by [[Ania Solo]], a local [[Junk dealer/Legends|junk dealer]] who was a descendant of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and a distant cousin of Empress Fel.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.16\">[[Legacy (2013) 16|''Legacy'' (2013) 16]]</ref> Following a skirmish, Darth Wredd managed to escape but Ania managed to rescue Yalta and Jao, who had been wounded during a skirmish with Wredd. While reports of the [[Carreras Incident]] were sketchy, Marasiah Fel later learned during a council meeting that a young woman named Ania Solo had been involved in the destruction of the Carreras Array.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.5\">[[Legacy (2013) 5|''Legacy'' (2013) 5]]</ref>\n\n===Enter Ania Solo===\n{{Quote|The girl must be brought to me&mdash;and not in luxury this time.

Once aboard the ''Animus'', Ania and her companions were welcomed as guests by the Imperials while Yalta and Jao were reassigned for duty on Coruscant. During a later council meeting, Empress Fel learned that the rogue Sith Darth Wredd had assassinated two Sith infiltrators on [[Cadomai Prime/Legends|Cadomai Prime]] and the Triumvirate Legation on [[Ceitia Five]]. Because of these events, Fel was faced with the dilemma of losing track of Wredd in favor of hunting down any Sith that infiltrated the various governments within the galaxy, or otherwise ignoring the Sith in favor of hunting down Wredd. In the end, Fel decided to leave Wredd alone since he was helping the Triumvirate by killing Sith.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.6\">[[Legacy (2013) 6|''Legacy'' (2013) 6]]</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Jao Assam received a [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]] of Darth Wredd attacking Marasiah Fel. Concerned about the Empress' safety, Jao abandoned his duties and embarked on a quest with his newly-found friend Ania to hunt down and stop Darth Wredd.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.6\" /> Upon learning that Ania had escaped, Empress Fel was furious that the Imperials had not detained Ania.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.7\">[[Legacy (2013) 7|''Legacy'' (2013) 7]]</ref> She had also been disturbed to read a report that Ania had allegedly murdered an Imperial Knight named [[Teemen Alton]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2.12\">[[Legacy (2013) 12|''Legacy'' (2013) 12]]</ref> Upon learning that Jao had absconded with Ania to hunt down Darth Wredd, she ordered that the two be brought to her as prisoners. Ignoring Master Yalta Val's pleas that Jao was going after Darth Wredd, Fel viewed Jao as a deserter and reminded her subordinates Val and Antares Draco that desertion carried the death penalty.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.7\" />\n\nDuring their travels, Jao Assam and Ania Solo discovered that another rogue Sith, [[Darth Luft]], and his pirate associates had established a slaving operation in the lawless [[Calamari system]]. Using a scam, Luft and his associates lured many [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] and [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] refugees back to Dac under the pretext of restoring the planet. However, they were enslaved and forced to build starships for the pirates. Jao sent a distress signal to Yalta Val on Coruscant. Upon receiving the news, Master Val tried to convince Empress Fel to attend to the plight of the Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees. Marasiah refused and dismissed Jao Assam as an unreliable source, asserting that they had no direct evidence of a Sith threat in those shipyards. A visibly annoyed Fel stated that the Triumvirate was already doing enough to help the Mon Calamari and Quarren with its limited resources. Despite Admiral Stazi's admonition, Empress Fel was unmoved and refused to order a strike on the [[Mon Calamari Shipyards (location)|Mon Calamari Shipyards]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2.9\">[[Legacy (2013) 9|''Legacy'' (2013) 9]]</ref>\n\nHowever, Admiral Stazi and Master Val disagreed with Fel's ambivalent attitude to the plight of the Mon Calamari and Quarren in the Dac system and assembled a task force to deal with the pirates. The Triumvirate task force succeeded in [[Liberation of Mon Calamari Shipyards|liberating]] the shipyards and apprehending the pirates. During the fighting, Darth Luft was killed by Jao Assam.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.10\">[[Legacy (2013) 10|''Legacy'' (2013) 10]]</ref> Ultimately, the Liberation of the Mon Calamari Shipyards proved to be a political success. Empress Fel regretted not supporting the strike and toyed with promoting Yalta Val, who declined since he preferred training Imperial Knight recruits on Coruscant. Following the successful Dac operation, the Empress ordered that the Triumvirate resume hunting for war criminals from the Second Imperial Civil War. Ania Solo ended up on the Triumvirate's \"Most Wanted\" list since she was alleged to have murdered the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.12\" />\n\nQuestioning Ania Solo's guilt, Master Val visited Empress Fel at her private office and questioned her justification for tracking down Ania. Marasiah Fel's was visibly angered by Yalta Val's dissension and threatened to strike him down with her lightsaber. However, she relented and remarked that serving as Empress did not supersede her vows as an Imperial Knight. Still unmoved by Master Val's concerns about Ania Solo's guilt, she proceeded to remind that when one Imperial Knight was harmed, the entire Imperial Knights body felt the pain. She reiterated that apprehending Ania would bring justice to the fallen Teemen Alton and stressed that bringing justice did not require justification.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.13\">[[Legacy (2013) 13|''Legacy'' (2013) 13]]</ref> Still questioning Ania's guilt, Jao examined Triumvirate files and found that Teemen Alton's real murderer had a prosthetic hand, something which Ania did not.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.14\">[[Legacy (2013) 14|''Legacy'' (2013) 14]]</ref>\n\n===The final battle===\n{{Quote|Imperial Knights!

During the trial, Master Yalta Val and Jao Assam succeeded in clearing Ania's name by presenting the real killer's prosthetic hand, something which Ania did not have. Following the trial, Jao Assam was arrested and imprisoned on charges of deserting the Imperial Knights.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.15\">[[Legacy (2013) 15|''Legacy'' (2013) 15]]</ref> However, he managed to escape with the help of Darth Wredd. Still loyal to his Empress, Jao decided to follow Wredd in order to foil his plans. Following Jao's escape, Empress Fel met with her relative Ania Solo. During the meeting, Fel expressed her view that Jao had not turned to the dark side but was merely seeking to foil Wredd's plot. Seeking to save Jao's life, Marasiah sent Ania to find him and bring him back. She explained that she could not be seen as being lenient towards Jao. Fel also admitted to spying on Ania Solo.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.16\" />\n\nFor this top-secret mission, Empress Fel assigned Ania with a platoon of [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] stormtroopers. Ania agreed to the mission in return for extracting a promise from Marasiah Fel to find a way around the desertion charges. Ania, her companions, and the stormtroopers departed on the [[Assassin droid/Legends|assassin droid]] [[AG-37]]'s [[AG-37's freighter|freighter]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2.16\" /> In secret, Empress Fel also planned to track down and kill Darth Wredd and instructed one of the stormtroopers, [[Blue Two (stormtrooper)|Blue Two]] to forward her Ania's coordinates. Ania's quest took her to the floating world of [[Mala (planet)|Mala]], where she found Jao Assam. However, Wredd had tricked Jao into transmitting the coordinates in order to lure both the Imperial Knights and the One Sith into a trap. A large One Sith army landed on Mala and proceeded to attack Ania's forces. During the [[Battle of the Floating World|battle]], Wredd resurfaced and helped Jao and Ania's companions to fight off the Sith horde until Marasiah Fel's reinforcements arrived.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.17\">[[Legacy (2013) 17|''Legacy'' (2013) 17]]</ref>\n\nDuring the fighting, Empress Fel remained aboard her [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer]] while her lover Antares Draco and Master Val led the Imperial Knights into combat against the One Sith. After Draco was wounded by a Sith, Marasiah entered the battle with a force of stormtroopers. Fel was grateful to Ania for attending to the wounded Draco. After a fierce battle, the Triumvirate, Ania's companions, and Darth Wredd succeeded in destroying the entire One Sith army. Empress Fel ordered her Knights to evacuate their wounded comrades and to hunt for the Sith survivors. While attending to the wounded Draco, Fel was stabbed from behind by Darth Wredd with his lightsaber, thus fulfilling Jao Assam's vision. Horrified, Jao pursued Darth Wredd and attacked him, slicing off his hands. However, Jao refused to kill Wredd, knowing that it would lead him to the dark side. In the end, Ania finished off the rogue Sith with a [[Heavy repeating blaster/Legends|heavy repeating blaster]].<ref name=\"Legacy 2.18\">[[Legacy (2013) 18|''Legacy'' (2013) 18]]</ref>\n\nDue to immediate medical intervention, Marasiah survived her injuries and was placed in a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]]. While conversing with Yalta Val, Fel learnt that all of the One Sith had been killed and that the Sith were supposedly gone from the galaxy. While Val regarded the end of the Sith as the end of history, Fel remarked that history had a way of continuing. Following the Battle of the Floating World, Marasiah returned to recuperate on Coruscant and met with Ania Solo. Grateful to Ania for saving the galaxy, she praised the Solo's courage and leadership skills and offered her a place in her personal guard. While Ania declined the offer, Marasiah Fel agreed to dismiss the desertion charges against Jao Assam and to allow him to join Ania and her companions in their travels throughout the galaxy. Empress Fel also began implementing reforms to the Imperial Knights Order to redirect their loyalty to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] rather than the Empress alone.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.18\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You're so much like your mother&mdash;my sister. Both of you are such warriors. Like her, you sacrifice so much for the Empire&mdash;for your father.|[[Hogrum Chalk]], to Marasiah Fel|Legacy\u2014War 1}}\n[[File:Marasiah_Fel_LECG.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Princess Marasiah Fel was driven by a strong sense of duty to the Empire.]]\nMarasiah Fel was known for her strong-willed and independent nature. She felt uncomfortable in doing \"what duty requires,\" to use the word of her father Roan Fel, while others sacrificed their lives for her.<ref name=\"leg2\" /> A princess of royal birth, Marasiah Fel was known to possess the usual poise and attitude of one who was born to a throne.<ref name=\"leg3\" /> Yet despite her haughty personality, she also possessed traits such as bravery, integrity and even humility. The death of her mentor, Elke Vetter, both saddened Fel and made her unwilling to allow others to die just so she could continue to live. Though the weight of her responsibilities caused her to occasionally long for freedom, Fel constantly maintained her commitment to defeating the Sith, all of whom were undoubtedly evil in her eyes.<ref name=\"leg6\" />\n\nHer resentment of the Sith caused Princess Fel to feel burdened with a great deal of personal shame and embarrassment because of her father's former alliance with the One Sith during the Sith\u2013Imperial War. The disgrace of her family name strengthened Marasiah Fel's resolve to undo the mistakes of her father by liberating the galaxy from the rule of Krayt and his Sith Empire.<ref name=\"leg6\" /> Her strong-willed and independent nature, as well as her steadfast commitment to honor and duty, made the princess a visible symbol of her father's struggle to retake the Empire that the Sith conquered from the Fel dynasty.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> In addition to Fel's relationship with her father, she was also close with her uncle, Hogrum Chalk, the brother of her late mother.<ref name=\"LegacyW1\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 1]]''</ref>\n\nThough loyal to her father and committed to duty, the princess defied Emperor Fel's will by pursuing a relationship with Antares Draco, her comrade amongst the Imperial Knights. Given her sense of independence, she did not hesitate to cross the line between duty and emotional attachments.<ref name=\"leg23\" /> Fel could also be uncompromising under most circumstances; she had absolutely no tolerance for traitors who broke their oaths to the Emperor, nor was she willing to allow the Sith to break her will during her time as a prisoner on Korriban--she even attempted to end her own life rather than risk being made to give up secrets, though the lightsaber she stole for this task was taken from here ere she could slay herself.<ref name=\"leg49\" />\n\n[[File:Marasiah_BW.png|thumb|left|200px|Fel was a skilled combatant, having trained in the art of the Force with the Imperial Knights.]]\nAs an Imperial Knight, she remained fully committed to the oath that she swore to uphold&mdash;serve the Emperor unless he falls from the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side of the Force]]. If the Emperor can not be redeemed from the dark side, then it was the duty of every Imperial Knight to strike down the fallen Emperor in order to save him from darkness. Princess Fel stayed true to her duty even as her father succumbed to the dark side during the Battle of Coruscant. She refused to stand by and do nothing while her father planned on killing the Empire's allies, as well as billions of innocent civilians on Coruscant, in his obsession to destroy the Sith. Her relationship with Draco enabled the Imperial Knight to prevent Roan Fel's catastrophic plan by fatally striking down the crazed Emperor.<ref name=\"LegacyW6\" />\n\nAs Empress, Marasiah Fel was committed to building trust and faith in the new Galactic Federation Triumvirate among its inhabitants. This led her to embark on an ambitious project to create a galactic-wide communications network linking the Outer Rim with the rest of the galaxy. She believed that the Triumvirate could not hold the galaxy together through brute strength and believed that the Triumvirate could only govern effectively with the consent of its inhabitants.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.1\" /> Even as Empress, Fel saw herself as an Imperial Knight foremost and only expected obedience from her subordinates. Fel did not easily tolerate dissent and issued desertion charges against the young Knight Jao Assam, after learning that he had embarked on an unauthorized mission to hunt down the rogue Sith Darth Wredd.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.7\" /> Fel did not respond to criticism easily and displayed anger on more than one occasions when her authority was questioned.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.9\" /><ref name=\"Legacy 2.13\" />\n\nAs an Imperial Knight, Fel regarded her fellow Knights as brothers and sisters in arms. This camaraderie led her to initiate a campaign to hunt down war criminals in [[139 ABY]]. Fel's desire to bring justice to the fallen Knight Teemen Alton led her to initiate criminal proceedings against her distant cousin Ania Solo, until evidence surfaced that exonerated her head.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.13\" /><ref name=\"Legacy 2.15\" /> Her concern with the bigger strategic picture led her to ignore or sidestep certain pertinent issues. On one occasion, Fel initially did not regard Darth Wredd as a threat since he was indirectly helping the Triumvirate by killing members of the One Sith, who had infiltrated key government positions.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.6\" /> On another occasion, Fel's concern with the Triumvirate's limited expenditure led her to oppose a mission to liberate Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves in the [[Calamari system]]; a decision she later regretted.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.9\" />\n\nDespite her shortcomings, Marasiah was honorable and gracious enough to repay those who had helped her or those whom she held dear. Fel was gratified that Ania and Sauk had took the trouble to tend to her wounded lover and comrade, Draco. She also admired qualities like courage, loyalty, and leadership. Fel was sufficiently impressed by Ania's performance during the Battle of the Floating World to offer Solo a position as captain of her personal guard. Marasiah was also mature enough to accept Ania's decision to decline that position. Despite her powers and authority, Fel was wise enough to reform the Imperial Knights so that their loyalty would not be directed to the Empress alone, but rather the light side of the Force. While Fel welcomed the apparent destruction of the One Sith on Mala, she was skeptical that the Sith threat to the galaxy had not been vanquished for all time.<ref name=\"Legacy 2.18\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|The Knights could use two more lightsabers on their side.

On page 19 of [[Legacy (2006) 7|''Legacy'' (2006) 7]], it was intended that [[Deliah Blue]] and Cade spend the night together. However, a coloring mistake in the issue showed Marasiah in place of Deliah. A corrected version of the page was published in [[Legacy (2006) 9|''Legacy'' (2006) 9]], and it was also corrected in the [[Star Wars: Legacy Volume 1: Broken|''Broken'' trade paperback]].\nIn a post on the [[Jedi Council Forums]], [[Jan Duursema]] wrote that she considers Marasiah to be \"about 18.\" This would mean she was born around 119 ABY.<ref name=\"JCF\">{{JCFcite|postnum=27930939|board=Authors and Artists|thread=The Official Jan Duursema Discussion Thread|user=Jan_Duursema|PTtime=1/3/08 6:20pm|accessdate=2013-02-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126062559/http://boards.theforce.net/threads/the-official-jan-duursema-discussion-thread.5915607/page-84}}</ref> Fel later appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Legacy\u2014War]]'', a six-issue spinoff of the original ''Legacy'' series, which was released in [[2011]].\n\nMarasiah Fel later reappeared in [[Corinna Bechko]] and [[Gabriel Hardman]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Legacy Volume 2]]'', the sequel to the original ''Legacy'' comic series, featuring Ania Solo, a descendant of the [[Original Trilogy]] character [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. Following a fan query, the series' editor [[Randy Stradley]] clarified that Fel's harsh reaction to another character Jao Assam's desertion stemmed from a \"there have to be rules\" standpoint rather than any personal animosity towards Jao. He confirmed that she was not going crazy like her late father [[Roan Fel]]. From Fel's standpoint, Jao had been given orders and he had chosen to ignore them.<ref name=\"SW L2 9 endnotes\">[[Legacy (2013) 9|''Legacy'' (2013) 9]] endnotes.</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*[[Legacy (2006) 8|''Legacy'' (2006) 8]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 2|''Legacy'' (2006) 2]] {{1st}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 3|''Legacy'' (2006) 3]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 5|''Legacy'' (2006) 5]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 6|''Legacy'' (2006) 6]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 7|''Legacy'' (2006) 7]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 9|''Legacy'' (2006) 9]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 12|''Legacy'' (2006) 12]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 15|''Legacy'' (2006) 15]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy: Loyalties]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy: The Hidden Temple]]''\n*[[Legacy (2006) 28|''Legacy'' (2006) 28]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 29|''Legacy'' (2006) 29]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 31|''Legacy'' (2006) 31]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 39|''Legacy'' (2006) 39]] {{Vision|Cade Skywalker}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 42|''Legacy'' (2006) 42]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 44|''Legacy'' (2006) 44]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 45|''Legacy'' (2006) 45]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 46|''Legacy'' (2006) 46]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 48|''Legacy'' (2006) 48]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]]\n*[[Legacy (2006) 50|''Legacy'' (2006) 50]]\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 1]]''\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 2]]'' {{C|Force illusion}}\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 3]]''\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 4]]''\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 5]]''\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 6]]''\n*[[Legacy (2013) 1|''Legacy'' (2013) 1]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 2|''Legacy'' (2013) 2]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 4|''Legacy'' (2013) 4]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Legacy (2013) 5|''Legacy'' (2013) 5]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 6|''Legacy'' (2013) 6]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 7|''Legacy'' (2013) 7]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 8|''Legacy'' (2013) 8]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Legacy (2013) 9|''Legacy'' (2013) 9]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 10|''Legacy'' (2013) 10]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2013) 12|''Legacy'' (2013) 12]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Legacy (2013) 13|''Legacy'' (2013) 13]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 16|''Legacy'' (2013) 16]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 17|''Legacy'' (2013) 17]]\n*[[Legacy (2013) 18|''Legacy'' (2013) 18]]}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Marasiah Fel}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Special Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Panel to Panel Volume 2: Expanding the Universe]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Legacy 0\u00bd]]''\n*{{SWMiniCite|set=Legacy of the Force|pack=Marasiah Fel|link=SWminiLOTF25marasiahfel.asp|archivedate=20160616160256}}\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Legacy Collection|pack=Antares Draco & Ganner Krieg|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/TLCcomicpacks05.asp|archivedate=20180213115434}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|118|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*{{InsiderCite|118|Ask Lobot}}\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Legacy Collection|pack=Deliah Blue and Darth Nihl|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/TLCcomicpacksLC16.asp|archivedate=20190831054503}}\n*{{InsiderCite|121|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|145|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}}\n*{{InsiderCite|151|Blaster (Star Wars Insider)|Blaster}} {{Imo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|154|Legendary Authors|Authors of the Expanded Universe: The Legend of Dark Horse}} {{Po}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[Emperor/Legends|Empress]] of the [[Empire-in-exile]]\n|years=[[138 ABY]]&mdash;\n|before=[[Roan Fel]]\n|before-years=[[130 ABY]]&mdash;[[138 ABY]]\n|after=<!-- This field should be left blank per the Layout Guide -->\n|after-years=}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Scroll box|content={{Reflist}}}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Marasiah Fel\n|es=Marasiah Fel\n|pl=Marasia Fel\n|ru=\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0424\u0435\u043b\n|deGA=1\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fel, Marasiah}}\n[[Category:Bastion residents]]\n[[Category:Fel family]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Emperors of the Fel Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Knights]]\n[[Category:Personnel of the Empire-in-exile]]\n[[Category:Personnel of the Fel Empire]]\n[[Category:Revived individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
