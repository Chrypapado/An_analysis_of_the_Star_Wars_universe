Go!|Avarik|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n'''Avarik''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] as a [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout trooper]] [[Corporal/Legends|corporal]] in [[Tempest Force]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nRenowned among his fellow Imperials as a frequent participant in off-duty bar brawls, Avarik was partners with [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Elsek]] following graduation from the [[Corulag Academy]]. His partner was often forced to cover for Avarik's rash decisions, such as Avarik's frequent engagement in brawls at Corulag's local bars and enlisted clubs. Elsek often had to bail his partner out of those fights. As a [[Corporal/Legends|corporal]], Avarik was assigned as part of a [[Scout trooper/Legends|biker scout]] unit to monitor the activities of the [[Yuzzum/Legends|Yuzzum]] on the forest [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]]. He later had an unpleasant encounter with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who bested him in fisticuffs, while Elsek, who he ordered to send backup, was knocked unconscious by the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{CCG|set=Endor Limited|link=Endor-Dark/large/corporalavarik.gif|cardname=Corporal Avarik}} {{1stID}}\n*{{CCG|set=Endor Limited|link=Endor-Dark/large/sergeantelsek.gif|cardname=Sergeant Elsek}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|avarik|Avarik, Corporal|archivedate=20100414013946}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Avarik\n|es=Avarik\n|nl=Avarik\n|pl=Avarik\n|ru=\u0410\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Enlisted stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
