At that time, the Nikto stood watching a Bith sitting near him. Soon after, however, the Nikto became bored, and drifted away toward [[Unidentified Quarren 2 (Moshi Bar)|a Quarren]]. By that time, Ahsoka had begun [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to listen in on people's conversations in the hopes of picking up on the whereabouts of [[Aurra Sing/Legends|a dangerous]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. The first conversation she heard was between this Nikto and the [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] he had recently encountered. The Quarren owned a business, and due to [[Clone Wars/Legends|the war]], it was doing poorly. All this was told to an extremely distracted Nikto, who turned slightly to let out a subtle grunt before the Quarren had finished his sentence. When a fight broke out between the Jedi and the patrons of the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]], the Nikto, along with the other patrons, soon became distracted from [[Credit chip/Legends|credits]] thrown by one of the Jedi.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Lethal Trackdown}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Kajain'sa'Nikto]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
