They were the most brutal and terrifying five days of my life.|Nanda|Star Wars (2013) 13}}\n'''Nanda''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] from [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] who served as an [[Ensign/Legends|ensign]] in the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. A few [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], she worked as [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] [[Aide/Legends|aide]] during a five-[[Standard day/Legends|day]] mission to find and punish every person the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] considered as responsible for the infiltration of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] agent [[Kell Bircher]] into the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] ranks.\n\n==Biography==\n===In the service of the Empire===\n{{Quote|I am from Naboo. I did my mandatory reservist training. I'm not much of a soldier, but I'm familiar with the emotions.|Nanda|Star Wars (2013) 13}}\nNanda, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], was born on the [[Mid Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] during the last [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"SW13\" />\n\nSince her graduation, she had been working on the [[Super Star Destroyer/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']]. In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], shortly after turning 21, Nanda was appointed by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor's]] second-in-command, as the [[Commanding officer/Legends|commanding officer]] of a [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of six elite [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], whose purpose was to deal with the mysterious [[Slicer/Legends|slicers]] who had inserted a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] [[Spy/Legends|spy]], [[Kell Bircher]], into the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]].<ref name=\"SW13\" />\n\n===Vader's mission of vengeance===\n{{Quote|We were on-site at the Data Center for nearly eight hours. We had the information we needed within the first fifteen minutes. The rest of the time was spent making examples and raising standards of conduct.|Nanda|Star Wars (2013) 13}}\n[[File:HorrifiedNanda.png|thumb|left|170px|Ensign Nanda had \"some difficulties\" with Vader's ruthless actions.]]\nNanda's first task was to fly their [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] to the [[Data Center]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. As soon as they reached their destination, she had to deal with a [[Deck officer/Legends|deck officer]], whose role was to check the crew and cargo of every incoming [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. Inside the Data Center, Nanda witnessed for the first [[Time/Legends|time]] Darth Vader's infamous ruthlessness with obvious fear and shock.<ref name=\"SW13\" />\n\nSeveral [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] later, the young ensign piloted their new ship, the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] [[Archer (Assassin-class)|''Archer'']], to [[Bothawui/Legends|Bothawui]]&mdash;where Vader's stormtroopers quickly took care of several [[Bothan/Legends|Bothans]] who were suspected to be the wanted data slicers. The next stop was the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] planet of [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]]. Vader brutally dealt with the command staff of his former [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Devastator/Legends|''Devastator'']], with Ensign Nanda watching the scene with wide-eyed terror.\n\nAfter leaving the [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]] facilities, Nanda spent a certain amount of time alone in the corvette's [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]]. When Vader came back from his personal quarters, the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] ordered Nanda to set a course for the [[Alderaan system/Legends|Alderaan system]] where, according to [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Intelligence]] reports, a [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing starfighter]] would have been spotted along with an old [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]]. Doubting the veracity of this information, Nanda tried to convince Vader that it was probably pointless to go there. She eventually complied when the Sith Lord insisted to go to the [[Star system/Legends|system]] \"at once.\"<ref name=\"SW13\" />\n\n[[File:VaderNanda.png|thumb|right|220px|Darth Vader and Ensign Nanda watching the remains of Alderaan]]\nUpon their arrival to the Alderaan system, Nanda detected the ''[[Audacity]]'', a [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] with a former Imperial [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] named [[Tag Rogaren]] on board. Vader subsequently sent his elite stormtroopers to bring back Rogaren alive aboard the ''Archer''. When the six troopers came back with their new [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]], they suddenly turned on Vader, who immediately attacked them with his [[Darth Vader's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. However, exactly as Nanda feared, the ship's [[Hull/Legends|hull]] was damaged during the fight. After having taken care of the treacherous troopers, Vader ordered Nanda to maintain course while he would repair the damages. When the Sith Lord was done with sealing the hull and [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] Rogaren, he told Nanda to set a course for the [[Chandrila system/Legends|Chandrila system]], as he had noticed that the traitor Bircher had a slight [[Chandrilan/Legends|Chandrilan]] accent.<ref name=\"SW14\">[[Star Wars (2013) 14|''Star Wars'' (2013) 14]]</ref>\n\nEnsign Nanda was then sent by Vader to Bircher's [[Mothma estate|childhood home]] on the planet of [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]]. On the site, she found three [[tombstone]]s belonging to members of the [[Mothma family]]. Nanda soon realized that Bircher was actually related to [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], one of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance. As soon as she [[Comlink/Legends|commed]] Vader to inform him of her discovery, the ''Archer'' destroyed the estate.<ref name=\"SW14\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{Quote|I never saw Lord Vader again. I should be relieved to have survived. Few could say the same.|Nanda|Star Wars (2013) 14}}\nAs promised,<ref name=\"SW13\" /> Nanda was promoted to the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Lieutenant Commander/Legends|Lieutenant Commander]] after the completion of her mission, and an impressive amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] was deposited into her accounts. However, she was so traumatized by the five days she spent with Darth Vader that Nanda had [[hallucination]]s, seeing the Sith Lord everywhere.<ref name=\"SW14\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Follow orders without question, and avoid culpability later.|Nanda|Star Wars (2013) 13}}\n[[File:TraumatizedNanda.png|thumb|left|180px|A deeply traumatized Nanda]]\nA native from Naboo, Nanda was a young woman with black [[Hair/Legends|hair]], brown [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and dark skin. One of her most prominent character traits was her unwavering loyalty to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. When she was assigned to act as Darth Vader's [[Aide/Legends|assistant]] during one of his missions of \"vengeance and redemption,\" she followed the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord's]] orders without questioning, despite her clear disgust with some of Vader's ruthless methods.<ref name=\"SW13\" />\n\nThe young ensign could also be perceived as na\u00efve. Despite knowing about the [[destruction of Alderaan]] by the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], she was genuinely surprised when they arrived to the [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] [[The Graveyard|Graveyard]] and saw nothing left of the Core World planet but [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroids]] and debris.<ref name=\"SW14\" />\n\nNonetheless, even though she was far from being cold-blooded and merciless like Darth Vader and the stormtroopers, Nanda had no objection to the slaughter of the Bothans who were suspected to have made Bircher's deception possible, simply because she had lost friends in the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] by the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"SW13\" />\n\nNanda proved to be a good [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], flying the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]] and the [[CR92a Assassin-class corvette|''Assassin''-class corvette]] Vader and his team of elite stormtroopers were traveling on across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. She also successfully used her diplomatic skills with an unidentified deck officer upon their arrival to the Data Center on Coruscant, which earned her a \"''Well done.''\" from Vader himself.<ref name=\"SW13\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|It's told through the eyes of a young ensign who is assigned as Vader's aide as he brutalizes his way across the galaxy.
