However, the negotiations were disturbed when Leeta sliced the personal computer of [[Galiir Ac Yandar]], the N.S.H. commander, and planted information that almost ruined his reputation with the Empire. By slicing Galiir's computer, Leeta planted incriminating evidence, which made it seem as though Galiir was putting the Empire in a bad light. Unfortunately for Poandeu, Galiir was cleared of any wrongdoings, but wanted revenge against the person who had sliced his computer.<ref name=\"SWG:II\" />\n\nGaliir discussed his plight with a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who was working for Imperial [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Braedic Ekirk]]. He informed the spacer that he was certain the slicer was a member of the A.C.L.O. He did not, however, know which member was responsible for the slicing. Galiir sent the spacer to the A.C.L.O office. The spacer was tasked with finding out more information, so that the culprit could be determined. After killing a number of A.C.L.O members, the spacer discovered a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] which indicated that Leeta Poandeu was the slicer. The spacer went to the second floor of the office, and entered the central computer control room. Immediately, the spacer began attacking Leeta, who in turn fired back. However, it was no use. Leeta was being outmatched by the spacer, and she soon feel to the ground lifeless.<ref name=\"SWG:II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLeeta Poandeu appeared as a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:II\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Leeta Poandeu was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Crisis of Allegiance|Crisis of Allegiance]]\" arc with the release of \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 2|Chapter 2: The Talus Incident]]\", on [[August 1]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref> In the game, players who partake in the so-called \"[[W:c:swg:Legacy Quest|Legacy Quest]],\" will eventually find themselves in the employ of Braedic Ekirk and Galiir Ac Yandar.
