He was grizzled in appearance, with a thick beard, and one wandering eye. He was considered to be crazy and was usually seen in crowds whenever anything interesting was going on. He thus knew quite a bit of what was going on, though he had lost the ability to discern rumor and lies from the truth, so he believed everything he heard. He knew quite a few conspiracy theories. He was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], but never received any training.<ref name=\"ACP\">''[[A Cularin Presence]]''</ref>\n\nNobody had heard Borus speak for over a decade, until [[Darin]] was kidnapped and a group of people were looking for him. Borus came up to them and told them a number of wild stories, many of them having to do with the [[Metatheran Cartel]]. One thing of interest the group gleaned was that he said that there was a hidden base in the jungle west of Gadrin, as that was the direction that the [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] who hit [[Renna's Transport Service]] fled after the attack.<ref name=\"ACP\" /> Borus turned up again several months later. The group of people he had talked to before were working with the [[Cularin resistance]]. He saw them enter the Cartel's offices in Gadrin and wandered up to the window to see what they were up to, but eventually wandered away.<ref name=\"ARv\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the [[Thaereian military]] sent [[Task Force Pest]] to arrest Force-sensitives on Cularin. They tried to arrest Ferthyn, but a mob gathered an protested against this, so [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Dalin]], the task force's commander, shot him. The people of Gadrin were outraged and Ferthyn's death led to rioting in the city.<ref name=\"Night's Promise\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Cularin Presence]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[A Revelation]]''\n*''[[Quarters]]''\n*''[[Night's Promise]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Night's Friend]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ferthyn, Borus}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
