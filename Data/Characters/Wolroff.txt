However, when the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Empire]] had gained intelligence on the prison's extensive security systems from a captured program, the systems now ignored CorSec personnel and only attacked Imperial forces. During the process, Wolroff and his forces encountered an Imperial strike team that were here to reprogram the systems at certain control nodes. The Imperial unit was successful, causing the prison security systems to inflict heavy enough losses and Wolroff was [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the process.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0444\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
