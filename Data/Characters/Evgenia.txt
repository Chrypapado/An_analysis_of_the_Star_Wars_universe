She later became a privateer and her duties included hunting down pirates and bringing them to justice, using a [[Z-95 Headhunter/Legends|Z-95 Headhunter]] named ''[[Dire Hound]]''. When she retired due to her age, the starfighter was hidden at a secret hangar on [[Talus/Legends|Talus]]. Eventually, around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Evgenia revealed to her nephew, with whom she spent many hours over the years sharing reminiscences, the location of the hangar and asked him to recover the starfighter. The young man decided to use it to fight against [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], the current legitimate government, which made Evgenia proud. Though getting the ship out of the hangar was not easy, both Imperials and [[Binayre Pirates]] tried to take from the young man, he was able to defeat them and bring the ship back to Corellia. Evgenia was pleased to see her old starfighter again and introduced her nephew to [[Lennart]], a Rebel officer, who revealed that the ''Dire Hound'' was the stuff of legend in the [[Corellian system]] and recruited the young man into [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Squadrons Over Corellia|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]"}}}]}}}}
