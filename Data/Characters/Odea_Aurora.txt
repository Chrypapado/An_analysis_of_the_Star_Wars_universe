Her [[Odea Aurora's mother|mother]] was a [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]], operating the [[Light freighter/Legends|light freighter]] ''[[Happy Failure]]''. When Aurora was six, her [[Odea Aurora's father|father]] [[Death/Legends|died]]. Her mother, wanting a better life for her daughter, moved them to [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] in the [[Bespin system/Legends|Bespin system]], where she established herself as an independent shipping contractor. Unfortunately, the goods she was carrying had, unbeknownst to her, been stolen from [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]. One of Jabba's underlings, the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Toln ne Yerres]], dealt with the situation by having the [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] [[Glongfurrp]] kill her. Aurora was playing with friends at the time, and was warned to never return to the ''Happy Failure''; she never did, and the grounded ship was gutted by [[Scavenger/Legends|scavengers]] and eventually turned into a [[Casino/Legends|casino]].<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\nAn orphan, Aurora learned to earn a living for herself making jewellery from left over electronics and scrap metal and selling them to tourists. She barely made a daily living selling to tourists at the back of [[loading bay 372]] in [[Port Town (Cloud City)/Legends|Port Town]], but refused all offers by other [[Merchant/Legends|merchants]] to sell her wares in their shops as she preferred to cut out the middle man. She was a member of the [[Merchant Guild]].<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\nSometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], a group of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] agents were directed to Aurora by a contact of hers on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Gerrenthum/Legends|Gerrenthum]]. They were tracking the [[Lenushaa gang]], who had stolen information from an Alliance cell on the planet. Aurora met them at [[K'cri's Cafe]], and relayed information to them that the [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] who stole the information, a [[Vessel (cyborg)|vessel]] named [[Tresk]], intended to transfer the information to [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Velantia]] of the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]] during a [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] game at the [[Pair O'Dice/Legends|Pair O'Dice]] [[Casino/Legends|casino]].<ref name=\"LF\">{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin|story=Lost and Found}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the evacuation of Cloud City in [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Aurora worked with the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]] [[Tristos Arctura]].<ref name=\"GMLA\">''[[Gamemaster Toolkit: Live-Action Adventures]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nOdea Aurora was an awkward young girl, who was self-conscious about her own looks when she thought about it<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> and tended to make mistakes when others were watching her. Left to her own devices, however, Aurora could move like an athlete.<ref name=\"GG2-2\">[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]</ref> She stood 1.67 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] tall, and had short, cropped [[Color/Legends|black]] hair. Although many believed that Aurora was shy, she was focused on one objective; finding her mother's killer and exacting revenge.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nA skilled jeweller who worked with cast-off pieces, Odea Aurora's work was popular if not totally profitable. She was connected to Cloud City's merchants and criminal underground, and knew how to survive. She was among the best hagglers in Port Town, and a shrewd bargainer.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nAurora mainly wore rags while in Port Town, but she did own two nice outfits for the times she went up to the main concourse to sell her jewellery.<ref name=\"GG2-1\" /> She carried a [[Knife/Legends|knife]] and jeweller's tools.<ref name=\"GG2-2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin|story=Lost and Found}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin]]''\n*[[Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin (Second Edition)|''Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin'', Second Edition]]\n*''[[Gamemaster Toolkit: Live-Action Adventures]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aurora, Odea}}\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]"}}}]}}}}
