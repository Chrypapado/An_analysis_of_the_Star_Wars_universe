He took over his father's shipping business; under his leadership, it became the most successful such business in the [[Chandrila system/Legends|Chandrila system]]. Because of this and his partial Academy education, the Chandrilan government made him the head [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] of the [[Chandrila Defense Fleet]]. He reorganized it to run more efficiently, cutting down [[Pirate/Legends|piracy]] and [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] dramatically. It was in his capacity as fleet commander that he came to know [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]].<ref name=\"DFRSB12\" /> During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Admiral Drayson was replaced as fleet head by [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]-appointed [[Kohl Seerdon]] after the passage of [[Reflex Amendment/Legends|Emergency Amendment 121b]].<ref name=\"Insider\" /> At some point in his career, he gained extensive experience serving aboard [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]], including a professional knowledge of their [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]] systems.\n\nWhen Chandrila was brought to heel under the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Starfleet]], Drayson was contacted by Mon Mothma, who offered Admiral Drayson a role in the military leadership of the new [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] as the commanding officer of the Alliance flagship. He accepted.<ref name=\"DFRSB12\" />\n\nAs the Alliance transitioned into the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], Admiral Drayson commanded the [[New Republic Second Fleet]] prior to the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|Liberation of Coruscant]].<ref name=\"The Essential Guide to Warfare\" /> Drayson was later placed in command of [[Home Guard Fleet|the fleet]] attached to the [[New Republic Provisional Council]], and then of the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] defense fleet.<ref name=\"DFRSB12\" /> He was tasked with the retrieval of the [[Katana fleet]] during the [[Thrawn campaign]].<ref name=\"DFR\">''[[Dark Force Rising]]''</ref> As a military commander, Drayson was considered competent but not very creative, which left him rather outmatched when [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]] carried out an elaborate [[Siege of Coruscant|attack]] against Coruscant. His intense personal loyalty to Mon Mothma also led to some friction with [[Garm Bel Iblis]], as he felt the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[General/Legends|General]] had betrayed Mothma by splitting away from the Rebel Alliance years earlier.<ref name=\"TLC\">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref> Later, Drayson's command experience, strategic mind and extensive contacts made him the ideal candidate for first Director of [[Alpha Blue]], and Mon Mothma appointed him under decree [[D9020616]].<ref name=\"BtS\" />\n\nAfter decades of service in the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]] apparatus, years that earned him the nickname \"the Old Ghost of Coruscant,\"<ref name=\"BtS\" /> Drayson retired from service following [[Borsk Fey'lya]]'s [[New Republic Presidential election, 23 ABY|election]].<ref name=\"VP\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]''</ref> He was married to [[Joi Eicroth]] for a time.<ref name=\"HT\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''</ref> He had a daughter, [[Bhindi Drayson]], who also served in New Republic Intelligence, as well as [[Wraith Squadron]].<ref name=\"RD\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|71|Republic HoloNet News Core Edition 14:10:03}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']]\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{1stm}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)|''Dark Force Rising'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising 6|''Dark Force Rising'' 6]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Last Command]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n*[[The Last Command 2|''The Last Command'' 2]]\n*[[The Last Command 3|''The Last Command'' 3]]\n*[[The Last Command 4|''The Last Command'' 4]]\n*[[The Last Command 5|''The Last Command'' 5]]\n*''[[Before the Storm]]'' {{1stID|Hiram}}\n*''[[Shield of Lies]]''\n*''[[Tyrant's Test]]''\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]''\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*{{Journal|15|Special Military Unit Intelligence Update}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Rebellion: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|22|BLA1-2, ''The Black Fleet Crisis''}}\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050407b|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 2|int=The Dark Forces Saga|archivedate=20100130004449}}\n*{{FFCite|116|CAL20, ''Lando Calrissian''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|cindeltowani|Towani, Cindel|archivedate=20100202232919}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''\n*<!-- 2014/10/20 -->''[[Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide]]''\n*''[[Strongholds of Resistance]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=Commander, [[New Republic First Fleet|New Republic First Battle Group]]\n|years=[[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]]<ref name=\"The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook\">''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''</ref><ref name=\"The Essential Atlas\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref>\n|before=Eventually [[Firmus Nantz]]<ref name=\"The Essential Guide to Warfare\" />\n|after=Eventually [[Traest Kre'fey]]<ref name=\"Star by Star\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref>\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0425\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043e\u043d\n|de=Hiram Drayson\n|es=Hiram Drayson\n|hu=Hiram Drayson\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drayson, Hiram}}\n[[Category:Alliance Fleet admirals]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Defense Fleet admirals]]\n[[Category:New Republic Intelligence personnel]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
