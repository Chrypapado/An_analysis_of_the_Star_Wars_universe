Not what I suspect. My lifelong job as a documentarian is to show the truth and expose lies. If I conclude that the position of my employers&mdash;that the Jedi have to be reined in for the sake of society, and anything the government does to rein the Jedi in is justified&mdash;is a lie, it sort of puts me in an awkward position. So I don't speculate.

He worked as a documentarian, and later became an [[Alliance Marshal]] assigned as a [[Jedi supervisor]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|So, to make sure nobody ever experiences a twinge of pain, I should move to [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] and live in a cave.''\"<br />\"''You could move to [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]] and jump into a [[Volcano/Legends|volcano]] instead.|Dab and Jaina|Fate of the Jedi: Outcast}}\nDuring the second year of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]] at the age of twelve, he was made to look like [[Anakin Solo]] by the treacherous [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Viqi Shesh]] in an attempt to confuse [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and kidnap [[Ben Skywalker]] from them. In return for this masquerade, during which Dab went by the name of \"Tarc Kether,\" Shesh promised a safe transport for his mother and sisters off [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].<ref name=\"Star\" />\n\nHowever, the plan failed. After the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]], Dab, along with other Coruscanti refugees, ended up on [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]], where he attended Anakin Solo's funeral. He was later taken on by [[Wolam Tser]] and [[Tam Elgrin]] as a [[Holocamera|holocam]] operator.\n\nSixteen years later, in [[43 ABY]], Dab was assigned by the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] as a [[Jedi supervisor]] to watch [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] on her missions. This was an annoyance for her as his appearance served as a reminder of Anakin Solo. Dab also confided in Jaina that he had been enamored with [[Tahiri Veila]] since he first met her during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Solo warned the young man to stay away from Veila, even though he had a crush on her.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nLater, in [[44 ABY]], [[Eramuth Bwua'tu]] contacted Hantaq to make an appearance in the [[Ninth Hall of Justice]] in the [[Galactic Justice Center]] on Coruscant during [[Trial of Tahiri Veila|Veila's trial]], as he hoped that her reaction to seeing Hantaq would make the jury sympathetic to her plight. Veila was shocked and deeply upset by this tactic, although the move achieved what Bwua'tu had hoped it would achieve, as the jury empathized more with Veila.<ref>''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Omen'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Allies'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dab Hantaq\n|es=Dab Hantaq\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hantaq,Dab}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi supervisors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
