Please, will you buy it?|Sharina to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Sharina Nal Fizark''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] whom [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] met in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3956 BBY]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===Death of her husband===\nSharina was married to a man named [[Ward Fizark]], who was a former [[Miner/Legends|miner]] and [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]]. During a hunting trip, he acquired a bone plate of a [[wraid]] which was worth five hundred [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] at the time. Ward told Sharina to keep it and went off for another hunt, but disappeared. Guards of a [[Sandcrawler/Legends|Sandcrawler]] found his body stripped of everything. She believed that the [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorreans]] [[Gurke]], [[Narkal]] and [[Ugzak]] were behind his death as they laughed at her about Ward's [[Death/Legends|death]].<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n===Hope from Revan===\nBecause her family had spent everything on Ward's gear, she was desperate for money after his death. She went to the streets trying to sell her wraid skull plate so that she and her children could buy passage off world. She could not sell it to the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Fazza Utral]] because she lacked a hunter's license.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\n{{GameLS|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nAt some point during the Jedi Civil War, she met the amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]. They discussed the wraid plate and her husband's death, and the former [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] purchased the plate from her and gave her an additional two hundred credits.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe gift of additional two hundred credits to Sharina described above is optional (the player still can buy the plate for only five hundred credits without the additional offer), however this decision rewards light side points. If [[Juhani]], [[Bastila Shan]], [[Carth Onasi]], [[Zaalbar]], or [[Mission Vao]] are in the player's party at that time, they will make a comment on the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] ethics. [[Canderous Ordo]] and [[HK-47]] do comment on the Jedi's decision, but do so in a negative manner.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nAlternatively, the player could convince Sharina to hand over the wraid plate so that it could be sold to Fazza. The outcome can still depend on the player's decision, even the canonical one.<ref name=\"KotOR\" />\n\nA non-canonical [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] option is to persuade Sharina to sell for half price. This offers dark side points, as it involves personal profit. Another dark-sided option is to take the plate from her by threats or via [[Mind trick/Legends|Force persuasion]].<ref>''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', Non-canon dark side choice</ref>\n\nThe player was originally supposed to be able to meet up with Sharina on Dantooine if they helped her on Tatooine, but this feature was cut from the game.\nThis content has since been restored as a mod [http://knightsoftheoldrepublic.filefront.com/file/Sharina_Fizark_Restoration;93107].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sharina Fizark\n|pl=Sharina Fizark\n|ru=\u0428\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fizark, Sharina}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
