''[[Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels]]'' states that Winter's mother, [[Sheltay Retrac/Legends|Sheltay Retrac]], had recently returned from maternity leave as of [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], but gives no further details. In the ''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]'', she is stated as being aged twenty-eight in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], which would make her roughly the same age as [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] (though born slightly before, since Leia is born during the events of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] when Winter's mother is already recovered from childbirth). However, in the novel ''[[Rebel Dawn]]'', set in [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]], Winter claims to be \"a year and a few months\" older than Leia, giving a birth date of [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]] or possibly [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]]. To complicate matters, in the same novel, Winter says she has \"just turned seventeen\", which would bring us back to a birth date of 19 BBY.</ref>\n|death=\n|species=[[Human/Legends|Human]] {{C|[[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]]}}<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n|gender=[[Gender/Legends|Female]]<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n|height=1.7 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]]<ref name=\"Databank\">{{DB|character|winter|Winter|archivedate=20101126071145}}</ref>\n|mass=\n|hair=[[Color/Legends|White]]<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n|eyes=Blue<ref name=\"eyes\">[[Del Rey]]'s ''[[Scoundrels]]'' promo bookmark described Winter's eyes as being blue.</ref>\n|skin=Tan<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n|cyber=\n|affiliation=*[[Alderaanian Resistance]]\n*[[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]<ref name=\"EGC\" />\n**[[Alliance Intelligence]]\n**[[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]\n*[[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]\n**[[New Republic Provisional Council]]\n*[[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]]\n**[[Galactic Alliance Intelligence Service]]\n*[[Darkmeld]]<ref name=\"Outcast\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref>\n|masters=\n|apprentices=}}\n{{Quote|I never forget anything.|Winter Celchu, to [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]]|Champions of the Force}}\n'''Winter Celchu''', the only child of [[Sheltay Retrac/Legends|Sheltay Retrac]], was raised as a sister and companion to [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] during the dark years of the reign of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Like her adopted sister, Winter became a pivotal player in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], serving in various roles, most notably as a [[Spy/Legends|spy]]. As an operative of [[Alliance Intelligence]], she served the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and later the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Her holographic and audiographic memory gave her a special advantage in piecing together confusing situations or even simply computing data. She was often attached to [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] as an intelligence officer, though sometimes under false identities.\n\nWinter also served a vital role as Leia Organa's best friend, [[Aide/Legends|aide]] and confidante. She had special relationships with Leia's children [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]], [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]], and [[Anakin Solo]], whom she raised during their first years of life. She had a long romance with [[Tycho Celchu]], from whom she was often separated by war, but the couple would eventually marry. She was also known to be a close personal friend of [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Ackbar]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nWinter was the only child of [[Sheltay Retrac]], the senatorial [[Aide/Legends|aide]] of [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]] at the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and an unknown [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaanian]] artist (possibly [[Ob Khaddor]]).<ref name=\"SWC\">''[[Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels]]''</ref> Her parents both died when Winter was still young.\n\n[[File:LilWinterNLeia-PLD.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]] and Winter as young girls on Alderaan]]\nShe was adopted by Bail and [[Breha Organa/Legends|Breha Organa]], and became [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia's]] best friend and companion.<ref name=\"note\">It is unclear why if both Leia and Winter were adopted by the Organas, only Leia received the title Princess. It is possible that either it was kept a secret that Leia was adopted and not a biological child, or that the adoption of Winter was of a less formal nature. No canonical source has yet addressed this point.</ref> The two grew up together on the peaceful planet of Alderaan and attended the best schools, learning about art and history, as well as ladylike graces. Possessed of a natural grace and poise, she was often mistaken for Princess Leia by visitors to Alderaan's court. This impression was increased by the fact that Leia's youthful tomboy nature did not seem as regal as Winter's stately bearing.\n\nDespite these differences in personality, however, Winter would remain a comfort to Leia, who had problems relating to the snobbish, cruel young girls at court. Though the pair's physical resemblance was tempered by Winter's stunning white hair, the two friends would soon learn to employ similar looks for tactical advantage, a practice they would continue throughout their lives. Winter would sometimes disguise herself as Leia so that Leia could escape the palace to create mischief and visit with inappropriate boys. It was probable that Winter attended the [[University of Alderaan/Legends|University of Alderaan]] with Leia, who recalled that Winter's perfect memory was very helpful when it came time to study for exams.<ref name=\"PLD\">{{Tales|11|The Princess Leia Diaries}}</ref>\n\nOne way or another, Winter and Leia were both schooled in Alderaanian ideals of freedom and liberty, as well as weaponry, on Leia's insistence. A key tutor was [[Sab\u00e9/Legends|Sab\u00e9]], the former [[handmaiden]] of Leia's mother, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref>''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\nAlso as teenagers, the young women encountered [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center]]. The image of Palpatine and his eyes, which made her feel as if he would drink up her spirit, would remain with Winter forever and influence her decision to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]].<ref name=\"RD\">''[[Rebel Dawn]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], on the occasion of the [[25th anniversary of the settling of the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention|25th anniversary]] of the [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention]], Winter and Leia attended a celebration and ran into [[Jahan Cross]]. Upon seeing the two young ladies three years after leaving Alderaan, Cross made it look like he did not recognize Leia, \"mistaking\" Winter for the Princess on purpose.<ref name=\"AotE:HT1\">''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]''</ref>\n\n===Rebel spy===\n====Early missions====\n[[File:Winter_with_Leia.jpg|thumb|250px|Winter and Leia during their years with the Rebellion]]\n{{Quote|So you were the one called Targeter. The one with the perfect memory.|[[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]]|The Last Command}}\nIn [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]] Winter participated in a Rebels meeting on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]] organized by [[Bria Tharen]]. Winter represented Alderaan alongside [[Hric Dalhney]] and a [[Caamasi]] named [[Ylenic It'kla]]. Winter, posing as Dalhney's daughter, served as the recorder for the Alderaanian delegation. Following Bria's initial speech to the attendees, Winter joined her for a cup of [[vine-coffeine]]. The two young women discussed their backgrounds, Corellian and Alderaanian culture, and the cruelty of slavery on [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]], forming a quick connection. Winter confided in Bria that she supported military action, despite Alderaan's traditional pacifism, and that she would try to convince Leia and Bail Organa of this truth. She also mentioned that she and Leia could accomplish much for the Rebellion, since both were trained with blaster and the prevailing galactic presumption that women were weak would make them appear harmless. Ultimately, the meeting on Cloud City would lead to the formation of the [[Corellian Treaty]] that officially formed the Rebel Alliance.<ref name=\"RD\" />\n\nTrue to her promise to Bria, when the Rebellion began Winter was heavily involved with many of the operations, partly because she was unassuming and non-threatening, but mainly because of her holographic and audiographic memory. Since Winter perfectly remembered everything that happened to her, she was particularly suited to a career in intelligence. She participated in several Rebel undercover missions with various code names such as \"Targeter.\"<ref name=\"The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook\">''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''</ref> Her time under the alias \"Targeter\" may have been cut short, however, when Imperial spies discovered and eliminated the Rebel cell on [[Averam]] she was working with.<ref name=\"Command\">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref> As a result of her successful procurement efforts, \"Targeter\" gained a spot on the Imperial's \"most wanted\" list and was to continue to serve in this role throughout the period from the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] to the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]].<ref name=\"The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook\" />\n\n[[File:WinterScoundrels.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Winter, living recording rod]]\n\nWinter was not on her home planet of Alderaan when it was destroyed by [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Tarkin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]]. She was on a mission for the Rebellion's [[Procurement and Supply/Legends|Procurement and Supply]] division, where she had been assigned to work by her adoptive father, Bail Organa. In this position, Winter worked to free caches of Imperial mat\u00e9riel for the use of the Rebellion. Sadly, Bail Organa died with his planet, leaving Winter many bitter&mdash;and perfect&mdash;memories. These memories of her home planet would haunt her forever. Yet ultimately, the destruction of her home planet only strengthened her commitment to the Rebel cause.<ref name=\"The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook\" />\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Winter joined [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo's]] group of criminals to perform a heist on [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] official [[Avrak Villachor]]'s well-secured vault on the planet [[Wukkar/Legends|Wukkar]]. She had been selected by [[Mazzic]], a [[Myke]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], for her photographic memory and good knowledge of security systems. At the time, Winter had no idea if Leia was still alive, as she didn't know whether the Princess had been on Alderaan when the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] destroyed the planet. She eventually learned from Solo that Leia was fine, much to Winter's relief.<ref name=\"Scoundrels\">''[[Scoundrels]]''</ref>\n\nAround [[0 ABY/Legends|0.5 ABY]], she was in contact with [[Porter (Rebel Alliance)|Porter]] and [[Casement]], two Rebel agents on [[Drunost]]. As \"Targeter,\" Winter worked off-planet with the duo, helping to coordinate arms shipments and reported back to [[General/Legends|General]] [[Carlist Rieekan/Legends|Carlist Rieekan]] on their status.<ref name=\"Allegiance\">[[Allegiance (novel)|''Allegiance'']]</ref>\n\nWinter was present at a briefing that was also attended by [[Tanda Marelle]], otherwise known as the notorious thief \"the Tombat.\" Winter was angry that Marelle was wearing a pendant that she insisted was a heirloom of the [[House of Organa/Legends|House of Organa]]. After Marelle left, Princess Leia Organa was seen wearing the pendant several days later.<ref name=\"CRO\">''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]''</ref>\n\n====Mission to Cilpar====\n[[File:Winter_Dress.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Winter, disguised as Leia and accompanied by stormtroopers on Cilpar]]\n{{Quote|On your feet, Highness. It's time to leave.''\"<br />\"''It's time for ''you'' to leave.''\"<br />\"''Shut up. I need you to pilot my shuttle.''\"<br />\"''Didn't you ever learn to do anything useful?|Moff Boren Tascl and Winter|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition}}\nIn the early period after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Winter continued to serve as a Rebel agent under the name \"Targeter\" and several times co-operated with [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. Her first encounter with the squadron was on [[Cilpar]], where she worked in defense of the planet's native resistance forces. During this [[Mission to Cilpar|mission]], she was disguised as her childhood friend Leia Organa. She discovered Rogue Squadron [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] [[Tycho Celchu]] and a very injured [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]] in a Cilpari cave infested with [[ronk]]s. After an initial misunderstanding, Winter convinced Tycho to pose as an Imperial [[Captain/Legends|captain]] to infiltrate the planet's Imperial leadership. Unfortunately, after Tycho had joined Cilpar's Imperial forces, Winter accidentally and unknowingly shot his [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighter]] down while piloting his [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]]. Soon thereafter, Winter and Janson were captured in their hidden cave by [[Vance Rego]], an Imperial spy posing as a Cilpari resistance member. Convinced that Winter was Leia, Rego took Winter into Imperial custody. Once transported to the Cilpari capital of [[Kiidan]], Winter was treated as a princess and the personal guest of [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Norquest]] and even given a seductive gown to wear and treated to a formal banquet. Fortunately, when Kiidan was attacked by Rogue Squadron and ground forces led by [[Elscol Loro]], [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Boren Tascl]] requisitioned Winter to pilot his shuttle. As Winter and Tascl entered the ship, Rogue Squadron arrived to save the day. Winter and Tycho then flew the Moff's shuttle back to her base. It was on this mission that sparks first flew between Winter and Tycho. Not only was Tycho personally compatible with Winter, like her he shared many tragic memories of Alderaan. However, early in their relationship, Winter often rebuffed Tycho's advances, fearing the pain that an attachment to him might cause.<ref name=\"The Rebel Opposition\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition]]''</ref>\n\n====The Tatooine affair====\n[[File:Tychowinter6.jpg|thumb|Winter (disguised as Windmere Wellen) at Huff Darklighter's ball with Tycho]]\n{{Quote|You have no chance against us. There will be no honor in defeating you.''\"<br />\"''Really? I think you're just afraid of losing to a woman.|Sixtus Quin and Winter|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine}}\nApproximately six months after the Battle of Endor, Winter was to [[Tatooine Campaign|work with Rogue Squadron again]]. This time, the Rogues were summoned to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. There they attended a reception thrown by [[Huff Darklighter]] to commemorate the anniversary of his son [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs's]] death. Together, Winter and the Rogues were investigating the continued Imperial presence on the planet in an attempt to prevent anarchy. Winter's mission was to stage a diversion so that she could steal a [[Datacard/Legends|data disk]] containing Imperial intelligence from Darklighter's safe. Winter, in disguise as [[Winter Celchu|Windmere Wellen]], was escorted by a smitten Tycho Celchu to the party. However, Winter's planned diversion was sabotaged by a group of [[Rodian/Legends|Rodians]]. She and Tycho chased the Rodians, eventually meeting up with the other Rogues&mdash;but failed to obtain the data disk. Winter intimidated Huff Darklighter into handing over his copy of the disk, which she analyzed to discover the location of an important cache of Imperial ships, including the [[Eidolon (Strike-class)|''Eidolon'']]. Unfortunately, the stolen copy of the disk was now in the possession of [[Firith Olan]], a crazed [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] who hoped to take over [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure's]] role as the primary crimelord on Tatooine. Using Huff Darklighter's [[weather satellite]], Winter tracked Olan's forces to their hideout. Unfortunately, while the Rogues were in pursuit of Olan, they encountered an Imperial squadron commanded by [[Marl Semtin]] and were forced to retreat, leaving Olan free to escape.<ref name=\"Battleground Tatooine\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter8.jpg|thumb|left|Winter relaxes on Ryloth after the race for the Globe of Victory.]]\nSoon thereafter, Winter, along with Wedge, Tycho, and [[Elscol Loro]] followed Olan to his homeworld of [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]]. There they met with [[Cazne'olan]], the head of Olan's clan hoping to purchase his capture with valuable [[Transparisteel/Legends|transparisteel]]. However, the Imperials had beaten the Rogues to [[Kala'uun/Legends|Kala'uun]] and were also negotiating for Olan's release. Cazne'olan and his associate [[Koh'shak]] had devised a competition between two Rebels and two Imperials to determine who would obtain Firith. After a brief debate, it was decided that Wedge and Winter would represent the Rogues. The two participated in a race for a gold \"Globe of Victory,\" encountering strange beasts and a deadly [[heat storm]] along the way. Because Wedge protected Winter during the race (despite the fact that she ordered him to abandon her), the Imperial naval commando [[Sixtus Quin]] reached the Globe first. When the dust cleared, however, the race participants realized that their experiences had been an illusion created by headband monitors which created a sort of virtual reality. Koh'shak congratulated Winter and Wedge for their courage and teamwork during the race, but refused to grant them victory. Meanwhile, Marl Semtin had bribed his way through the Twi'lek compound and fled with Firith Olan. Angered by his commander's lack of honor, Sixtus Quin defected to the Rogues.<ref name=\"Battleground Tatooine\" />\n\nThe group, now accompanied by Quin and his companion [[Septaas]], rejoined the other Rogues on Tatooine, hoping to take Olan by force. Marl Semtin and Olan, who now occupied the hidden ''Eidolon'' base, were engaged by the Rogues. In the ensuing firefight, several Rogues were shot down, Firith Olan was stabbed by Semtin and captured by [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna's]] brain walker, and Sixtus Quin killed Semtin. Thanks in part to Elscol's heroic attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer, the Rogues successfully captured the ''Eidolon''.<ref name=\"Battleground Tatooine\" />\n\n[[File:Tycho-kiss.jpg|thumb|220px|Winter and Tycho kiss after a successful mission.]]\nBy the end of the Tatooine affair, Winter's relationship with Tycho had reached a new level. Throughout the mission, Tycho had flirted with Winter, but she had continually spurned him. At one point, it seemed that Tycho might even give up on Winter, stating that she seemed to have \"ice water in her veins\" when she informed him that she would have abandoned Wedge in order to obtain the Globe of Victory. During the final battle for the ''Eidolon'', Winter was convinced that Tycho was killed when his X-wing crashed into several TIE Fighters. Previously hesitant about giving into her feelings for Celchu, Winter broke into tears, only to be informed by Wedge Antilles that Tycho had used a code phrase, \"going out with a bang,\" to indicate that he was about to eject from his craft. Finally putting aside her trademark stoicism, Winter shared a kiss with Tycho as their mission concluded.<ref name=\"Battleground Tatooine\" />\n\n====The defection of Sate Pestage====\n[[File:Winter_as_Leia.jpg|thumb|left|Winter in disguise as Leia Organa]]\n{{Quote|Why a two-seater? I thought you liked the idea of snuggling.|Winter to Tycho, on their escape from Axxila|X-Wing Rogue Squadron 31}}\nIn hopes of spending more time with Tycho Celchu, Winter voluntarily participated in further missions with Rogue Squadron, including the squadron's rescue of Imperial defector [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]]. Winter's role involved standing in as a double for Princess Leia. Successfully testing her disguise, Winter discussed the relationship between Tycho and herself, without him catching on to the deception. After arriving on [[Eiattu 6]], Han Solo sent Tycho up to Leia's room, where he finally met the disguised Winter and shared several kisses. However, the two were interrupted when [[Rayt (smuggler)|Rayt]] and his thugs, agents of [[Leonia Tavira]], knocked out and captured the couple, bringing \"Leia\" and her \"[[Aide/Legends|aide]]\" to their boss on [[Axxila/Legends|Axxila]]. Under the cover of their capture, the real Princess Leia met with Sate Pestage. In exchange for his life, along with ten worlds for himself and fifteen worlds for four friends, Pestage offered to leave [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] virtually undefended from attack. He also arranged for his agent [[Kavil]] to arrange the release of Winter and Tycho from Tavira. Yet Tycho and Winter managed to [[Undercover operation on Axxila|escape]] on their own, breaking out of their separate cells, fighting past the guards, stealing a [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-wing]], and out-flying the pursuit offered up by Kavil's [[Corsair (Derriphan-class)|''Corsairs'']]. Fortunately, they managed to send out a distress call, and Rogue Squadron and the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] cleared the way back to base for Tycho and Winter. However, an Imperial [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]], the [[Reckoning (Imperial II-class)|''Reckoning'']], arrived in the system at the same time. The ship under command of Admiral [[Delak Krennel]] was sent by Ysanne Isard to capture Leia. After have recovered Pestage, the Admiral launched his [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]] on the planet and began [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]]. The New Republic agents situation was critical when Krennel was stopped by an [[AT3 Directive]] issued by [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]]. Delak Krennel was forced to obey at the behest of Sate Pestage and left the system. Winter and Tycho then shipped back home aboard the ''Falcon''.<ref>''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Masquerade]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter_Tycho.jpg|thumb|Winter and Tycho enjoy a garden stroll.]]\nBack on base, Winter enjoyed walking among the gardens, as well as dining and dancing with Tycho, Wedge, and [[Reina Faleur]] at the officer's club. One of their nights at the club was cut short, though, when Rogue Squadron was called back to headquarters. There, Winter participated in the rushed planning of Pestage's extraction from [[Ciutric IV]], accompanying the ground intrusion team to rescue Pestage. Along with [[Kapp Dendo]]'s commandos, they broke Pestage out of prison, but were trapped on the surface of Ciutric IV by Delak Krennel and his ''Reckoning'', reinforced by the Interdictor ''[[Binder]]''. The intrusion team and Rogue Squadron fled to the night side of the planet, and Wedge ordered an attack on an Imperial outpost. Once it was seized, Winter helped rig a [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] communication for Wedge so he could send a message out, though he did not tell her who he was calling. As it turned out, Wedge had called [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Terrik]], who arrived in the ''[[Pulsar Skate]]'' and helped sneak the commandos, Winter, and Pestage out of Ciutric, escorted by the Rogues and aided by [[Aggressor Wing]], who had arrived with Terrik. However, Pestage turned his back on the Rebels during the mission and deserted them, leading to his death at the hands of Krennel. Following the mission, Winter attended the funeral of [[Ibtisam]], the one Rogue Squadron pilot killed during the fight.<ref>''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''</ref>\n\nThroughout the post-Endor period, Winter piloted a freighter that was perfectly designed for her profession as a spy. Though it had no consistent name, it possessed such technological innovations as surveillance equipment, slicer droids, an [[Bis.2 data storage module|advanced storage module]], powerful [[Deflector shield/Legends|deflector shields]], and [[Aurum thruster]]s for speed.<ref>''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''</ref>\n\n===Expanding the New Republic===\nLater, after Rogue Squadron re-formed in [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]], Winter was instrumental in the New Republic capture of Coruscant. She and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]] initially infiltrated the planet and set the stage for the Rogue Squadron commando team to arrive. During this period Winter used the pseudonym \"Rima Borealis\" as well as her standard \"Targeter\" alias. She served as a contact for [[Corran Horn]] and [[Erisi Dlarit]] while Iella worked with [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] and [[Pash Cracken]]. While leading Corran and Erisi on reconnaissance missions (disguised as tourists), Winter inquired about Tycho. Horn was wary of Tycho after his capture by [[Ysanne Isard]], who was known for brainwashing her prisoners and sending them out as covert agents. Suspicious of his fellow Rogue, Horn picked a fight with Winter about Tycho's tragic losses on Alderaan. Winter, however, won the argument when she fully revealed Tycho's personal history, leaving Corran chagrined. Corran and Winter soon reconciled, however.<ref name=\"Gamble\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter_Meeting.jpg|thumb|left|Winter briefs Rogue Squadron.]]\nWhile working on Coruscant, Winter's slicing skills came in handy when breaking into the planet's Imperial computers to deactivate the planetary shields. An initial plan to insert a sliced computer core into the main center was foiled by spies inside the Rebel organization. Surviving the following ambush, Winter was one of the few trustworthy people remaining to aid the Alliance. Winter was then part of the raid on a subsidiary computer center and a [[EVS Construction Droid]] that allowed the planetary shields to be deactivated. Working with Wedge Antilles, her quick-thinking and speed on a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] helped to coordinate the Rogue Squadron pilots in their fight to take the planet. Winter, aiding Wedge, was able to slice into a [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE Interceptor's]] controls and send it crashing into a power station, and also took over [[OSETS 2711]] to destroy an Imperial [[Golan space defense platform]].<ref name=\"Gamble\" />\n\nAfter the conquest of Coruscant, Winter's love interest, Tycho, was arrested for the murder of Corran Horn. Winter paid Tycho many visits while he was imprisoned and even served as a witness in his trial, hoping to defend him. Tycho, who had been framed, was freed when Corran escaped from the [[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]. Horn also revealed that Isard had never broken Celchu, permanently ending the cloud of suspicion over his loyalty. Winter joined Tycho for the award ceremony at which [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] awarded the Rogue Squadron members the [[Coruscant Star of Valor]].<ref>''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter_Flight_Suit.jpg|thumb|Winter makes repairs.]]\nFollowing these events, the members of Rogue Squadron left the Alliance military in order to invade the politically sensitive planet [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]], the main supplier of the precious [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] that was needed to stem the tide of the horrific [[Krytos virus]] released by Ysanne Isard. Winter assembled intelligence on Thyferra and presented this information to the squadron in a special meeting immediately before their departure for their new base at the [[Yag'Dhul/Legends|Yag'Dhul]] space station, where she was to join them and serve as part intelligence officer, part [[Quartermaster/Legends|quartermaster]]. Her findings, including several Imperial supply dumps, proved crucial to the Rogues' success. At this time, Winter also alerted Wedge Antilles to a store of X-wings and parts on [[Rishi/Legends|Rishi]]. Also around this time, Tycho Celchu left a memorial for his fianc\u00e9e Nyiestra (who perished during the destruction of Alderaan) at [[the Graveyard]]. His memorial gift, suggested by Winter, was a symbolic acknowledgment of both his own personal transformation and his new love for Winter. Soon thereafter, when Rogue Squadron was ambushed by the Imperial [[Immobilizer 418 cruiser/Legends|Interdictor cruiser]] ''[[Aggregator]]'' and [[Victory I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Victory I''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Corrupter/Legends|''Corrupter'']], Winter's holographic memory helped the Rogues to discover more information on the mysterious ship which came to their rescue. It was the [[Valiant (Thranta-class War Cruiser)|''Valiant'']], an Alderaanian ship that was the escort of the famed ''[[Another Chance]]''. The Rogues eventually gained control of the ''Valiant,'' and after their eventual success on Thyferra, brought it with them when they returned to the New Republic military under the command of [[Aril Nunb]].<ref>''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''</ref>\n\n===Provisional Council aide===\n[[File:Winter_Last_Command.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Winter investigates Delta Source.]]\nAs the New Republic established itself as a legitimate government, Winter moved from her work in intelligence to more diplomatic functions. While her friend Leia served on the [[New Republic Provisional Council]], Winter worked as her aide. With her perfect memory, Winter was a natural choice as the recorder for the Council's crucial meetings, though apparently not all of the Council members were aware of her special gift.<ref name=\"Heir\">''[[Heir to the Empire]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Thrawn campaign]], while Han and Leia traveled through the galaxy attempting to escape capture by the [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]], Winter served as their Coruscant liaison and covertly passed information on to them regarding the inner politics of the Provisional Council. In particular, she kept them informed about the ongoing smear campaign implicating Admiral Ackbar for [[Treason/Legends|treason]], and on the machinations of [[Borsk Fey'lya]].<ref name=\"Heir\" />\n\nLater, while Luke Skywalker conducted research on [[Jorus C'baoth]], Winter provided assistance by using her perfect recall to provide Luke with a physical description and other pertinent information about C'baoth. Winter was familiar with this due to C'baoth's role in mediating an [[Alderaan Ascendancy Contention|ascendancy flap on Alderaan]], which led to the Organa family ascending to the position of viceroy.<ref>''[[Dark Force Rising]]''</ref>\n\nIn this period, Winter also served as hostess to [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] while the woman recovered from her injuries at the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]]. Mara was to eventually become a close friend of Winter's, joining the intimate circle of highly-placed New Republic women including Leia, Winter, Mara, [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Antilles]], and [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax Horn]]. (Interestingly, over time, Mara and Leia became closer, while Winter and Leia grew apart, to the point where Leia eventually acknowledged that Winter's best friend was Iella.)<ref>This is noted in several of the post-[[New Jedi Order era]] books. See ''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]'' and ''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''.</ref> Winter was the one who informed Mara of the current state of the Thrawn crisis; Mara had been unconscious for a month as she healed. During the course of their conversation, Mara expressed her wish that Winter could help her obtain a ship on which to depart Coruscant. At their introduction, Winter was piqued that after an inquiry about Winter's activities during the Rebellion, Mara was able to identify her as \"Targeter.\"<ref name=\"Command\" />\n\n[[File:Winterbaby.jpg|150px|thumb|Winter with Leia and one of the [[Solo twins]]]]\nAs Leia recuperated from the delivery of her twin children Jaina and Jacen, Winter began probing the old Rebel Alliance archives for information about possible Imperial agents within the government. Suspicious of Mara Jade's recognition of her as Targeter (thought to be known only to a few Imperial agents on Averam), Winter informed Leia that Mara might have Imperial connections. This information led Leia to confront Mara about her past. Soon thereafter, Winter was present for the attempted kidnapping of Leia and her children. Mara Jade's timely rescue helped to ease Leia and Winter's minds about Mara's allegiances. As a result of this event and concerned for the safety of the infant Solo twins in the face of continued danger, Leia invited ten [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]] bodyguards to Coruscant to protect her, the twins, and Winter. This proved to be a fortuitous decision&mdash;when Coruscant came under attack a few days later, Leia's political duties called, and it fell to Winter and the Noghri to defend the twins. This presaged a pattern that would hold for most of the twins' childhood.<ref name=\"Command\" />\n\nAs the Thrawn crisis escalated, Winter worked with Leia and the [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] [[Zakarisz Ghent]] to discover the nature of [[Delta Source]], which had been leaking key information to the camp of [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] Thrawn. Winter's memory proved itself useful once again as she used surveillance holos to track who in the Imperial palace was privy to particular pieces of gossip or diplomatic conversations. Though she was stumped as to who Delta Source could be, Winter was soon able to discover that the [[Grand Corridor]] of the Imperial Palace was likely the site where Delta Source was obtaining its information. Luckily, Leia was able to deduce that Delta Source was actually a complex organic microphone embedded in one of the Grand Corridor's monumental [[ch'hala tree]]s.<ref name=\"Command\" />\n\nWinter continued serving the Provisional Council through the end of the Thrawn crisis, conveying the location of the planet [[Wayland]] to them, and babysitting the Solo twins when Leia traveled with [[Talon Karrde]] to assist Han, Luke, Mara, and Lando there. Following the conclusion of the Thrawn crisis, Winter would leave politics to pursue other duties for Leia.<ref name=\"Command\" />\n\n===Protector of the Solo children===\n[[File:WinterJugglesKids-DEII6.jpg|thumb|left|Winter protecting the Solo twins from Dark Jedi]]\n{{Quote|Tycho's wife used to babysit Jaina, in fact.|[[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], to [[Zekk]]|Legacy of the Force: Betrayal}}\nUpon the conclusion of the Thrawn crisis, Winter became the caretaker of Leia Organa Solo's newborn twin children, [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina]]. Leia's brother [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] was concerned that the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] children would be particularly vulnerable to attack (Imperial or otherwise) during their first two years of life.<ref name=\"Search\">''[[Jedi Search]]''</ref> Therefore, the decision was made to sequester the children for several years, at the same time freeing their parents, Leia and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], for important New Republic duties. Initially, Winter kept Jacen and Jaina on [[New Alderaan/Legends|New Alderaan]] with the protection of the [[Noghri/Legends|Noghri]].<ref>''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]''</ref> However, the depredations of the resurrected [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] and the birth of the twins' younger brother [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]] necessitated a change in both locations and strategies.<ref>''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire II]]''</ref>\n\nThereafter, Winter and the children moved to the planetoid [[Anoth/Legends|Anoth]], where a special base had been constructed for them. Besides having cutting-edge security, this base was designed to be stimulating and educational for small children. Winter assisted Admiral Ackbar with the planning and construction of the base, and with him and Luke, Winter was one of the three people who knew Anoth's actual location. On Anoth, Winter served as the primary caregiver of the children until they returned to live on Coruscant with their parents. Every few months, Winter would pick up Han and Leia and shuttle them to Anoth to visit with their offspring.<ref name=\"Search\" />\n\n[[File:Winter-SWF.jpg|right|thumb|Winter favored formal, elaborate dresses.]]\nIn [[11 ABY/Legends|11 ABY]], Winter dropped off Jacen and Jaina on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], the twins now being two years old and deemed strong enough to live with their parents. That evening, Winter and Leia discussed Han's disappearance during a scheduled mission to [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]]; Winter advised Leia to contact authorities on that planet to determine if Han had arrived safely. The two then contacted [[Moruth Doole]], whose evasiveness raised the suspicion of both women. (Indeed, Doole had kidnapped Han and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] and set them to work in his [[Spice/Legends|spice]] [[Mine/Legends|mines]].) A few days later, Winter left to return to Anoth and baby Anakin, much to the Solo twins' dismay. Indeed, even the typically stoic Winter seemed sad to leave the children behind on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Search\" /> Though she remained proud to do her duty, the lonely days on Anoth had taken their toll on her, and the twins' departure brought on a brief bout of depression.<ref>''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nSoon thereafter, Winter entertained Admiral Ackbar on Anoth. Ackbar, disgraced by his inadvertent destruction of the [[Cathedral of Winds/Legends|Cathedral of Winds]] on [[Vortex/Legends|Vortex]], intended to pay Winter a visit and then return to his homeworld of [[Dac]] to live in seclusion. The two shared a brief meal and discussed Ackbar's scandal. Winter invited Ackbar to stay with her and care for Anakin, but he declined, much to Winter's disappointment. Little did Winter realize at the time that Ackbar had been tracked&mdash;and that she would soon face the consequences.<ref name=\"Apprentice\">[[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']]</ref>\n\nSeveral months later, Winter and baby Anakin came under attack on the secret planet of Anoth. Anoth's location had been betrayed by Ackbar's brainwashed aide, [[Terpfen]] (who had tracked Ackbar's ship), to the Imperial [[Ambassador/Legends|Ambassador]] [[Furgan]]. Furgan had arrived to Anoth on his [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|''Dreadnaught''-class heavy cruiser]] [[Vendetta (Dreadnaught-class)|''Vendetta'']] captained by [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Ardax]] in an attempt to kidnap Anakin and raise him as the new [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]]. After deploying her station's [[Foreign Intruder Defense Organism|FIDO]] against an attack by Furgan's fearsome [[Mountain Terrain Armored Transport]]s, Winter fought bravely, hoping to lead the stormtroopers away from Anakin. Through her ruse, she was able to draw some troops into a trap, leaving them vulnerable to assassin droids. Then, in the nick of time, Leia and Ackbar arrived on-planet to provide assistance and rescue Anakin aboard the ''[[Galactic Voyager]]''. However, in years to come, Winter's role in the [[Battle of Anoth (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Anoth]] would be remembered as decisive. At the conclusion of the [[Sun Crusher]] crisis, Winter would attend the re-dedication of the Cathedral of Winds on Vortex. There, Ackbar encouraged her to once more take an active role in New Republic politics, hoping that he might be able to spend more time with her in such a capacity.<ref>''[[Champions of the Force]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter_Yellowgown.jpg|thumb|left|Winter displays her trademark stoicism.]]\nFollowing these events, all the Solo children returned to Coruscant to live with their parents, since Anoth was no longer safely hidden. The children found it difficult at first to adjust being raised by someone other than Winter, although Winter still played a large role in their lives, often traveling with them as a nanny and assistant. In [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]], she accompanied the Solo family and Luke Skywalker to [[Ithor/Legends|Ithor]] to attend the [[Herd Meet]]. After the deranged [[Drub McKumb]] staged an attack on the Solos there, she escorted the children to protection.<ref>[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']]</ref> She was still attending the Solo children when Leia was kidnapped by [[Seti Ashgad/Legends|Seti Ashgad]], and most likely looked after them when Han and Chewbacca left in search of Leia. Meanwhile, one of the tricks Winter had learned from an outlaw on Coruscant&mdash;lock picking&mdash;and passed on to Leia allowed Leia to escape imprisonment on [[Nam Chorios/Legends|Nam Chorios]].<ref>''[[Planet of Twilight]]''</ref>\n\nIronically, Winter was away attending a conference on runaway children when [[Hethrir]] kidnapped the Solo kids in [[14 ABY/Legends|14 ABY]]. The very runaway children Winter was investigating had been abducted by Hethrir for use in his [[Empire Youth]] indoctrination program.<ref>''[[The Crystal Star]]''</ref>\n\nBy [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], Winter continued to spend time with the Solo children, giving C-3PO a hard-earned break every once in a while. On one occasion, Anakin Solo, upset by C-3PO, ordered a [[TDL nanny droid]], [[TDL-3.5]], to come replace the protocol droid. Winter, however, with a bit of persuasion, convinced the droid to go back to the warehouse, much to C-3PO's relief. Yet soon after, [[Kueller]]'s [[Almanian Uprising#Bombings|bombing]] of the [[Senate Hall]] forced Winter to temporarily bring Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin back to the safety of the rebuilt Anoth shelter.<ref>''[[The New Rebellion]]''</ref>\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Winter_Union.jpg|thumb|200px|Winter relaxes before Mara Jade's wedding.]]\n{{Quote|By ''Intelligence'' in this case, you mean your wife.''\"<br />\"''Yes.|Admiral Niathal and Tycho Celchu|Legacy of the Force: Exile}}\nFollowing the [[Almanian Uprising]] in [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], Winter finally married her longtime love, [[Tycho Celchu]] of [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]].<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Winter was also present for the nuptials of [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] in [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]]. She joined Mara's group of friends, including Leia, [[Iella Wessiri Antilles]], [[Mirax Terrik Horn]], and [[Tionne Solusar]] in helping the bride with her preparations, including a spa visit and a [[slingball]] match versus [[Champion Squadron]].<ref>''[[Star Wars: Union]]''</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Winter had taken to aiding former New Republic [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Gial Ackbar]] in his pursuit to bring safety and recovery to the aquatic world of [[Dac]].<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Ackbar had long been a special friend of Winter's, from at least the time the two were privy to the secret location of Anoth.<ref name=\"Apprentice\" /> During the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Ackbar was found to be in declining health due to his old age. Winter assisted her friend and cared for him as he prepared the plans for the climactic [[Battle of Ebaq]].<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref> Winter was present when he passed on during the midst of the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar]], informing Galactic Alliance command of the Mon Calamari's death. She told her husband after the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar]] and the end of the war that she'd leave him if he didn't retire.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref>\n\nBy [[40 ABY]], Winter and Tycho were firm supporters of the Galactic Alliance in the [[Second Galactic Civil War]], leading to their alienation from their best friends, Wedge and Iella Antilles. Tycho, suspicious that the so-called [[Chasin Document]] was actually a revision of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Garm Bel Iblis]]'s [[Operation Blue Plug]] (which dated from the Galactic Civil War), enlisted Winter to conduct an investigation to determine if the still-classified Blue Plug documents had been sliced into. Winter discovered that the Alliance's backup code had indeed been sliced using a [[Galactic Alliance Guard]] (GAG) passcode and had been altered so as to send files to a spy. Winter scrubbed the military network of the spy's code and turned over her findings to [[Galactic Alliance Intelligence Service|Galactic Alliance Intelligence]]. Tycho was to present Winter's findings to a group of Galactic Alliance military personnel, including Admiral [[Cha Niathal]] and Jacen Solo, who was infuriated about the implication of GAG in the security breach and refused to believe his former nanny's discovery. Later, however, when Jacen needed to send a message from [[Uran Lavint]] to his parents, he enlisted Winter's help to initiate direct contact with the Solos, who had essentially disowned him.<ref>''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[43 ABY|43.5 ABY]], Winter became a member of the secret [[Darkmeld]] organization, and assisted in the [[Raid on the Armand Isard Correctional Facility]].<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> She later aided Jaina Solo in attending a dinner date with [[Jagged Fel]].<ref>''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:AsianWinter.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Winter Celchu]]\n{{Quote|I'm beginning to see where you got your name. Agent Winter, you've got ice water running in your veins.|Tycho Celchu|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine}}\nWinter was noted for her stoicism, causing her future husband Tycho to remark that her name well-suited her chilly personality. However, Winter's emotional control was both a coping mechanism for dealing with the destruction of Alderaan and a useful technique she employed in her career as a spy. It also may partly have been a result of her royal upbringing and was in stark contrast to Leia Organa's more emotive style.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> In her personal life, her stoic nature was also helpful, as it allowed her to spend long periods away from her partner Tycho Celchu while both were involved on missions across the galaxy. It also made her a very reasonable and composed nanny for the often-mischievous Solo twins.<ref>Examples of this abound, see for example, ''[[Jedi Search]]'', where Winter maintains composure as she leaves the twins and subsequently C-3PO and Leia struggle to get them to behave. ''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]'' also notes that though Winter dearly loves the twins, she does not let her emotions interfere with doing what is best for the children.</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter.png|thumb|right|100px|Winter sans disguises]]\nIn terms of her personal style, Winter could best be described as elegant and stately. Growing up, Winter had better fit the role of \"princess\" than her friend Leia did, and though Leia eventually grew out of her tomboy phase, Winter retained her regal bearing.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Though Winter's line of work often required her to wear practical clothing such as jumpsuits, her tastes were never as functional as Leia's. Indeed, at different times in their adulthood, Leia would remark that Winter seemed fashionable and distinguished even in an old robe and that she favored expensive, impractical clothing made out of materials such as [[vine-silk]].<ref>See both ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' and [[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']]</ref>\n\nHer most unique trait was her memory, which was both holographic and audiographic. She had perfect recollection of everything that had ever happened to her, and all information that came to her.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> Across the galaxy, this trait was highly uncommon. Ironically, one other individual who possessed this trait, Imperial officer [[Kirtan Loor]], was a contemporary and an enemy of Winter's. Winter's memory proved useful time and time again in her service to the Rebel Alliance and later the New Republic. Eventually, however, this ability would cause her some emotional difficulty, as she remembered every experience, even the most painful, in complete detail.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nWinter also was a very skilled slicer and a master of disguise, often impersonating her adoptive sister Leia.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWinter was created by author [[Timothy Zahn]] for the early 1990s [[Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy|Thrawn Trilogy]]. There, and in many subsequent [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] novels, Winter's purpose is to serve in capacities normally filled by Leia when Leia is otherwise occupied due to plot or continuity concerns. She also functions as a foil for the more excitable Leia.\n\nThere is a slight discrepancy in the sources regarding Winter's alias \"Targeter.\" In ''[[The Last Command]]'', Winter tells Leia that she only used this alias for \"a few weeks\" and only on Averam. However, in numerous other sources such as ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition]]'' and ''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]'', Winter uses this alias in other locations and on other missions. Even Timothy Zahn, Winter's creator, appears to contradict his earlier work when, in [[Allegiance (novel)|''Allegiance'']], \"Targeter\" is mentioned as active on [[Drunost]].\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*''[[The Last of the Jedi: Master of Deception]]''\n*{{Tales|11|The Princess Leia Diaries}}\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]''\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Journal: Captive to Evil]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Scoundrels]]''\n*[[Scoundrels (audiobook)|''Scoundrels'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'' {{Flash}}\n*[[Allegiance (novel)|''Allegiance'']] {{C|Mentioned only, as Targeter}}\n*[[Allegiance (audiobook)|''Allegiance'' audiobook]] {{C|Mentioned only, as Targeter}}\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: The Rebel Opposition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: In the Empire's Service]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Masquerade]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n*''[[A Forest Apart]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Tatooine Ghost]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]''\n*[[Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)|''Dark Force Rising'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Last Command]]''\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire II]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Tales|16|The Other (comic)|The Other}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Jedi Search]]''\n*[[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']]\n*''[[Champions of the Force]]''\n*[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']]\n*[[Darksaber (novel)|''Darksaber'']]\n*''[[Planet of Twilight]]''\n*''[[The Crystal Star]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Before the Storm]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Shield of Lies]]''\n*''[[Tyrant's Test]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Rebellion]]''\n*''[[Specter of the Past]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Specter of the Past (unabridged audiobook)|''Specter of the Past'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Union]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Omen'' audiobook]]\n}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Winter Celchu}}\n*''[[Heir to the Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Dark Force Rising Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives]]'' {{C|As \"Targeter\"}}\n*{{Topps|set=1995 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 3|cardname=Les Dorscheid}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{Topps|set=1996 Topps Star Wars Finest|cardname=Winter}}\n*''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Far Orbit Project]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|12|The Women Of Star Wars}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}}\n*{{FFCite|94|TDL2, ''TDL Nanny Droid''}}\n*{{FFCite|105|WIN 1-4, ''Winter''}}\n*''[[Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels]]''\n*''[[The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Rebellion Era Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{DB|character|winter|Winter|archivedate=20101126071145}}\n*{{DB|character|bailorgana|Organa, Bail|archivedate=20110209094446}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2012 Topps Star Wars Galactic Files Series 1|cardname=Winter (Rebel Agent)}}\n*{{InsiderCite|138|Scoundrels?
