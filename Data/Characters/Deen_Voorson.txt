While on Hoth, he was one of the technicians who converted the [[T-47 airspeeder/Legends|T-47 airspeeders]] to the cold. When he returned home to [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]], he asked his aunt [[Nell Voorson]] to allow him and the Rebel Alliance to steal power generators, something she refused to do. When he learned that someone had arranged for the Rebellion to steal the generators, he believed his aunt had a change of heart, but was instead surprised to find it was orchestrated by his nine-year-old cousin [[Shannon Voorson]], who joined him and [[Boo Rawl]] and defected to the Rebel Alliance.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|11|The Most Dangerous Foe}}\n*{{Journal|9|Slaying Dragons}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voorson, Deen}}\n[[Category:Alliance Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kuati]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]"}}}]}}}}
