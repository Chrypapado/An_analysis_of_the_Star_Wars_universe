Greck betrayed Pitareeze, stealing the plans for the [[Pitareeze Cruiser]] while the Baron slept and producing cheaper versions of it. He sold these claiming that they were his own original designs.\n\nYears later, Pitareeze opened the [[Kalarba Safari]], which was ran by himself and his family. When key components of Greck's ships failed, he begged for the Baron's help in fixing the flaws, but the Baron refused. Olag Greck then kidnapped the Baron's grandson, Nak Pitareeze and forced him to fix his ships. Fortunately, Greck's plans were foiled by the two droids.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Droids Special 1]]''\n*[[Droids (1994) 1|''Droids'' (1994) 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Droids (1994) 3|''Droids'' (1994) 3]]\n*[[Droids (1994) 4|''Droids'' (1994) 4]]\n*[[Droids (1994) 5|''Droids'' (1994) 5]]\n*{{GalaxyCite|1|Star Wars: Droids: Artoo's Day Out}}\n*[[Droids (1994) 6|''Droids'' (1994) 6]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|25|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth}} {{Po}}\n*''[[C-3PO: Tales of the Golden Droid]]''\n*{{FFCite|38|WRE3-4, ''GRZ-6B Wrecker Droid''}}\n*{{FFCite|112|KAL2, ''Kalarba''}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Baron Pitareeze\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Kalarba residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
