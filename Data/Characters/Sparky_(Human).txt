Then it turned into ''violent'' work as I became frustrated.|Sparky|Star Wars: Invasion}}\n'''Sparky''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]] from the planet [[Artorias]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe was working to repair the [[comm interlink]] in the [[Artorias communications center]] at the beginning of the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] [[Yuuzhan Vong War|invasion]]. While he was struggling to fix the interlink, he was interrupted by a [[Dulac|cloaked man]] who offered to help him finish the job, commenting that he did not like the idea of Artorias being cut off from the rest of the galaxy.\n\nFrustrated at his work, Sparky accepted his offer but told the man to tell everyone else that he was the one who fixed it since that his was job. The man proceeded to apparently fix the interlink and also received a distress signal from the crew of the exploration ship ''[[Pythea]]''. The [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] female explorer [[Panha]] warned him of the danger of an approaching Yuuzhan Vong fleet. The man told them that their message had been received but did not tell Sparky about the message.\n\nSparky was then told by the cloaked man that his attempts had also failed. Unaware of Panha's distress signal and the impending Yuuzhan Vong invasion, he commented that there was nothing wrong with his planet being left in the dark. However, the cloaked man removed his form-concealing [[Cloaker|ooglith masquer]]; revealing himself to be a hidden Yuuzhan Vong advance agent.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Artorias]] Sparky joined with [[Caled Galfridian]] in the [[Artorias resistance]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Invasion 0|''Star Wars: Invasion'' 0]] {{1st}}\n*[[Invasion 1|''Invasion'' 1]]\n*[[Invasion: Rescues 2|''Invasion: Rescues'' 2]]\n*[[Invasion: Rescues 3|''Invasion: Rescues'' 3]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19915 Interview with writer Tom Taylor]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sparky (Person)\n|es=Sparky (humano)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Artorias residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
