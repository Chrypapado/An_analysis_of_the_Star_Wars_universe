I'm sad to see another join our ranks&hellip; I lost my husband, Lootra, long ago in the Jedi Civil War.|Aaida upon meeting Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Aaida''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who lived on [[Telos IV]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]]. A survivor of the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith]] bombardment of the [[Planet/Legends|world]] in [[3958 BBY]], she was separated from her [[Marriage/Legends|husband]], [[Lootra]], during evacuation. Seven [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later, Aaida was present on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], where the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|Exile]] [[Meetra Surik]] reunited her with Lootra.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Jedi Civil War===\nAaida lived with her [[Marriage/Legends|husband]] Lootra on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Telos IV]] during the early stages of the [[Jedi Civil War]], a conflict between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire]].<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nIn [[3958 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date1\">The ''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]'' places both [[Saul Karath]]{{'s}} defection and the [[bombing of Telos IV]] in [[3958 BBY]].</ref> [[Republic Navy]] [[Rear Admiral/Legends|Rear Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]] defected to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. Soon after, he led a [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] against Telos IV and called for the planet's surrender. When the inhabitants refused, [[Darth Malak]] ordered an [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]] of the planet.<ref name=\"KOTOR I\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''</ref> Aaida and Lootra survived the assault, but the two were separated during evacuation. Aaida made it onto a civilian [[Starship/Legends|ship]] and escaped, while her husband boarded another. The Sith did not destroy the ship, and Aaida belied that it was because they wanted living witnesses to the attack. The ship, loaded with refugees, jumped from system to system, just ahead of the Sith's warships.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n===On Nar Shaddaa===\n[[File:Refugee sector.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aaida was forced to live in the Refugee Sector.]]\nOn the run for years, Aaida began to think she would never see her husband again. Seven [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later, in [[3951 BBY]]<ref name=\"Date2\">'[[The Essential Atlas]]'' places the events of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' in [[3956 BBY]]. In game dialogue from ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' places it five [[Standard year/Legends|years]] after the events of ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'', thus putting the events of the game, in which Aaida appears, in [[3951 BBY]]</ref> during the [[First Jedi Purge]], Aaida found herself living in the [[Refugee Sector]] on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]{{'s}} [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]], [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]].<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" /> \n\nDuring this [[Time/Legends|time]], Lootra had been moving from planet to planet in search of her. Coincidentally, he arrived on Nar Shaddaa during Aaida's time there. The [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|Exile]] [[Meetra Surik]], who was on Nar Shaddaa in search of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], approached him. Lootra asked Surik to help find his wife, and she agreed. Surik was able to locate Aaida within the Refugee Sector and tell her of her husband, but Aaida was unable to leave due to the [[Exchange]] guards blocking the exit. The Exile was able to deal with the guards, and Aaida left the Refugee Sector to be reunited with her husband. Surik later approached the couple, who thanked her profusely and gave her a reward.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAaida appeared as a non-player character in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]]. Talking to Lootra begins the quest \"Intergalactic Reunification,\" which is completed by talking to Lootra after the two have reunited. After beginning the quest, Aaida gains new dialogue which allows you to progress. The quest is not absolutely necessary to progress the plot, but increases the Exchange's notice of the Exile, which must be increased to progress.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" /> ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' states that Surik reunited the couple,<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> an ending which gives the player [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] points.\n\nAaida's entries in both ''The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia'' and the now defunct [[Databank (original)|Databank]] on [[StarWars.com]] state that she was kidnapped by the exchange to force Lootra to join them;<ref name=\"CSWE\" /><ref name=\"Databank\">{{DB|character|aaida|Aaida|archivedate=20100327195623}}</ref> a description of events contradicted by the game itself.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n===Gameplay Alternatives===\n{{Quote|That was well executed&mdash;you used his own doubt to foster trust and reliance. Perhaps you are learning much in the flow of Nar Shaddaa.|Kreia's dialogue if the player convinces Lootra to give up his search.|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nPlayers can avoid the \"Intergalactic Reunification\" quest altogether, and instead use other quests to increase the Exchange's notice of the Exile.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nThe player can convince Lootra to give up his search and join the Exchange, which increases influence with [[Kreia]] and prompts dialogue if she is in your party. Alternatively, the player can decide to kill Lootra, which grants [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\nOnce the quest has been initiated, the player can decide to lie to Aaida and tell her that the guards have been taken care of when they have not. This prompts Aaida to attempt to escape the Refugee Sector, dying in the process and giving the player dark side points.<ref name=\"KOTOR II\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|aaida|Aaida|archivedate=20100327195623}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Aaida#legends\n|fr=Aaida\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
