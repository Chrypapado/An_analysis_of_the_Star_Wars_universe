Unlike many of his fellow monks, Evilo did not seek concepts like \"truth\" or \"enlightenment\", and continued to communicate with the outside [[Planet/Legends|world]] in whole sentences rather than images. He instead spent his days amassing more information on the universe, something he could not do in a normal lifetime. He also befriended the [[Frog-dog/Legends|frog-dog]] [[Buboicullaar/Legends|Buboicullaar]] and taught him the ways of the B'omarr.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tongue-tied: Bubo's Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nailati, Evilo}}\n[[Category:B'omarr Monks]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
