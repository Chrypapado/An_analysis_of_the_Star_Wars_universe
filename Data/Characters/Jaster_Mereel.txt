Charged with murder, Mereel was [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] from Concord Dawn, going on to join the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]]. An accomplished [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]], Mereel's prowess in battle earned him the respect of his [[Mandalorian Supercommando|supercommando]] peers, and he eventually became [[Mandalore (title)|''Mand'alor'']], the leader of all the Mandalorian clans, and the ''[[Al'Ori'Ramikade]]''\u2014\"Commander of Supercommandos.\" As ''Mand'alor'', Mereel instituted a new guideline for Mandalorian behavior known as the [[Supercommando Codex]] in which he asserted that the Mandalorians who wished to fight would simply be highly paid soldiers, and should conduct themselves as honorable [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]].\n\nMereel faced opposition to his reforms both from the peaceful [[New Mandalorians/Legends|New Mandalorian]] faction, and the more dangerous [[Death Watch/Legends|Death Watch]], a violent splinter group formed by the followers of Mereel's rival, [[Tor Vizsla]]. A [[Mandalorian Civil War (True Mandalorians)|civil war]] broke out between the Death Watch and the [[True Mandalorians|supercommandos]] loyal to Mereel, the early years of which saw Mereel's [[Battle of Concord Dawn|return]] to his [[Homeworld/Legends|home planet]], where he saved the life of a [[Fett (Elder Journeyman Protector)|local farmer's]] son\u2014[[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango Fett]]\u2014when the Death Watch attacked the boy's [[Fett homestead|home]]. Taking Fett in following the death of [[Clan Fett|his family]], Mereel raised the boy as a his own son until the fateful [[Battle of Korda Six|Battle]] of [[Korda Six]]. Ambushed by the Death Watch and betrayed by his second-in-command, [[Montross (bounty hunter)|Montross]], Mereel was killed by Vizsla. His body was carried back to the Mandalorians' landing zone by Fett, where Montross was exposed as a traitor and Fett succeeded his adoptive father as the new ''Mand'alor'', in accordance with what Mereel would have wanted.\n\n==Biography==\n===Fighter for reform===\n{{Quote|Jaster will do what's right for the Mandalorians&mdash;he always has.|Jango Fett|Jango Fett: Open Seasons}}\n[[File:Mereel_Montross.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Jaster Mereel, several years after becoming ''Mand'alor'']]Jaster Mereel was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], born on the [[Agriworld/Legends|agricultural]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Concord Dawn/Legends|Concord Dawn]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim's]] [[Mandalore sector/Legends|Mandalore sector]]. As an adult, Mereel served as a [[Journeyman Protector/Legends|Journeyman Protector]]\u2014one of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld's]] respected lawkeepers\u2014until he was driven by his strong moral code to [[Death/Legends|kill]] a corrupt superior [[Officer/Legends|officer]]. Mereel was subsequently charged with murder, and [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|exiled]] from Concord Dawn. At some point after, Mereel joined the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]]; an accomplished [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]], Mereel's martial prowess earned him the respect of his peers.<ref name=\"HotM\">{{InsiderCite|80|The History of the Mandalorians}}</ref> Around [[60 BBY/Legends|60 BBY]], Mereel had attained the rank of [[Mandalore (title)|''Mand'alor'']], the traditional leader of the Mandalorian clans.<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Having noticed many Mandalorians' dissatisfaction with the widespread savagery that had become prevalent in certain warrior circles, Mereel hoped to hold the Mandalorians to a higher standard of behavior. As ''Mand'alor'', Mereel instituted the [[Supercommando Codex]], a new behavioral guideline influenced by Mereel's own moral ideals, in which Mereel decreed that any Mandalorians who wished to fight would be merely highly paid soldiers, and should conduct themselves as honorable [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]].<ref name=\"HotM\" /> It was around this time that Mereel had some dealings with the [[Regent of Mek va Uil|Regent]] of [[Mek va Uil]], acting as both ''Mand'alor'' and ''[[Al'Ori'Ramikade]]''\u2014\"Commander of Supercommandos.\" During this interaction, Mereel informed the [[Regent/Legends|regent]] of his views on what it meant to be a mercenary, and why they were deserving of respect.<ref name=\"O66\">''[[Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, Mereel's ideas were not unanimously accepted throughout the Mandalorian community. By this [[Time/Legends|time]], many Mandalorians had joined the peaceful movement of the [[New Mandalorians/Legends|New Mandalorians]], a reformist political faction formed in the aftermath of a [[Mandalorian Excision|devastating conflict]] with the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] centuries earlier. The New Mandalorians had moved away from the traditional warrior ways, denouncing the old [[Canons of Honor|warrior codes]], and believed that the best opportunity for Mandalorian survival and prosperity would come through being peaceful, neutral, and tolerant.<ref name=\"TEA\">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> Further dissension came in the form of a number of a amoral Mandalorians who resented Mereel for his attempts to rein in their enjoyed lifestyles of unaccountability. These malcontents rallied to a Mandalorian soldier named [[Tor Vizsla]], and therein formed a splinter group known as the [[Death Watch/Legends|Death Watch]] with Vizsla as their leader, under the pretense of returning the Mandalorians to their ancient roots as [[Mandalorian Crusaders|conquerors and raiders]] with the goal of instigating another [[Mandalorian Wars|war of conquest]].<ref name=\"HotM\" /> Though the Death Watch's goals were quite opposite to the New Mandalorians', they could neither support Mereel's faction of loyal supercommandos\u2014now calling themselves the \"[[True Mandalorians]]\"\u2014for despite his reforms, any act of Mandalorian violence was fundamentally against what the New Mandalorians stood for.<ref>{{TCW|The Mandalore Plot}}</ref> Mereel was pressured by Mandalorian hard-liners such as [[Montross (bounty hunter)|Montross]] to destroy the Death Watch,<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> and [[Mandalorian Civil War (True Mandalorians)|civil war]] soon broke out between Mereel's True Mandalorians and the Death Watch. The New Mandalorians kept to their ideals of pacifism and non-violence, rejecting both groups<ref name=\"TEA\" /> and remaining out of the conflict that came to be known as the [[Mandalorian Civil War (True Mandalorians)|Mandalorian Civil War]].<ref name=\"HotM\" />\n\n[[File:Concorddawn.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jaster Mereel rescues a young Jango Fett from the Death Watch.]]\nIn the year [[58 BBY]], Mereel returned to his homeworld as the Mandalorian Civil War [[Battle of Concord Dawn|spilled onto Concord Dawn]]. Hunted by the Death Watch after a lost firefight, Mereel and his men were forced to rely on the kindness of the Journeyman Protector who'd replaced Mereel, a man by the name of [[Fett (Elder Journeyman Protector)|Fett]]. He offered them refuge on [[Clan Fett|his family's]] [[Fett homestead|farm]], and brought them food in the fields. However, the Death Watch captured Fett's young son, [[Jango Fett/Legends|Jango]], and attempted to use the boy, in addition to a brutal beating, to force the Journeyman Protector to reveal the location of Mereel and his True Mandalorians. Fett would not give in, and a chaotic firefight erupted when [[Jango Fett's mother|Fett's wife]] attempted to save her husband and son. Both Fett and his wife were killed, although Mereel stepped in\u2014giving up his cover\u2014in order to save young Jango's life. As the Death Watch set fire to the field Mereel and his troops had fled into, Jango led them to an irrigation pipe that would take them safely away from the blaze.<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" /> Mereel regrouped his forces in a nearby town and laid in wait until the Death Watch arrived, at which time he sprang an ambush. With the Mandalorians firing on the Death Watch troops, Jango placed an explosive charge on the underside of the [[Death Watch tank|armored speeder]] Vizsla rode into the town upon. The tank exploded, although Vizsla escaped. As the battle came to a close, Mereel located Jango standing over the body of the Death Watch soldier who'd murdered his parents. Praising the boy's courage, Mereel decided to take Jango with him as the Mandalorians departed Concord Dawn, and he eventually came to consider the boy his son.<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" />\n\n===Betrayal on Korda Six===\n{{Quote|This should be easy credits.|Jaster Mereel, just before the battle that resulted in his death.|Jango Fett: Open Seasons}}\n[[File:Jasterdeath.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jaster Mereel fights in the Battle of Korda Six.]]\nBy [[52 BBY/Legends|52 BBY]], six years after the battle on Concord Dawn, Mereel believed the Death Watch to be finished. With the Death Watch gone, Mereel now led his True Mandalorian supercommandos as a mercenary force, and it was in that capacity that they traveled to the planet [[Korda Six]]. Contracted by the [[Korda Defense Force]], Mereel and his men had been hired to extract a rookie security team pinned down under fire by a force of local hostiles. Kordan intelligence suggested minimal resistance; the natives had no formal army and were poorly armed.<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" /> Considering the mission \"easy [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]],\" Mereel divided his men into three teams: [[Vertigo Company]], an aerial unit utilizing [[Jetpack/Legends|jetpacks]] under Mereel's second-in-command, Montross, \"[[Jango's grunts|Jango's Grunts]],\" which would provide cover fire and hold the extraction zone, under the command of a now teenage Jango Fett; and [[Headhunter Company]], Mereel's own unit, charged with reaching the recovery site and extracting the security team. As the Mandalorians boarded their [[Meteor-class Q-Carrier|ships]], Mereel spoke briefly with Jango, asking the boy to make him proud.<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" />\n\n[[File:Jaster_Mereel_death.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jaster Mereel is killed by Vizsla, following Montross' betrayal.]]\nOn the approach to the planet's surface, Mereel's ships took heavy damage from [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]] fire, forcing most to make the best of rough crash-landings. The \"minimal resistance\" estimated turned out to be vastly inaccurate, and almost immediately, the Mandalorians came under heavy fire. Mereel was helpless as numerous soldiers fell victim to enemy [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], and it wasn't long until the ''Mand'alor'' called for them to abort [[Battle of Korda Six|the mission]] and retreat. Montross refused to comply, unwilling to have a retreat on their record, and pushed forward, only to fall prey to a [[Grenade/Legends|grenade]] blast that left him wounded and in need of rescue himself. That rescue came from Mereel, who shot and killed no fewer than three enemy [[Kordan]] before angrily reiterating his orders for a retreat.<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" /> At the same time as Jango and his team stumbled upon a Death Watch ambush, Vizsla arrived on the battlefield in a four-wheeled [[Tank (vehicle)/Legends|tank]]. Mereel berated Montross' foolhardy actions as the reason they were in such a situation, swearing to have him ejected from his mercenary crew if they survived the battle. Vizsla was determined to see that they would not survive, launching a [[wrist rocket]] that injured Mereel, although Montross avoided it using his jetpack. As Vizla opened fire with a [[Laser cannon/Legends|laser cannon]], Mereel called to Montross for an airlift. But Montross had decided he would no longer take orders from Mereel and turned his back on the ''Mand'alor'', leaving him to die alone on the battlefield while he returned to the other Mandalorians. Mereel soon fell to fire from Vizsla's tank, though Jango tried desperately to reach him. It was in Jango's arms that Mereel succumbed to his injuries.<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" />\n\nMontross attempted to take over leadership of the Mandalorians upon his return to camp, claiming that Mereel was dead and that Jango had perished trying to save him. However, Jango returned to the camp, carrying with him his adopted father's body, and exposing Montross as a liar and a traitor. As Montross slipped off into exile, Jango succeeded Mereel the new ''Mand'alor'',<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" /> just as the other Mandalorians believed Mereel would have wanted,<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" /> having previously chosen Jango as his successor.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> Jango went on to avenge Mereel by killing Vizsla on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]],<ref name=\"OpenSeasons\" /> and later Montross on [[Kohlma|one]] of the [[Moon/Legends|moons]] of [[Bogden/Legends|Bogden]].<ref name=\"BountyHunter\">''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]''</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Ugh!
