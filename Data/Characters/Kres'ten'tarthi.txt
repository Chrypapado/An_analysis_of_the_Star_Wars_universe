Although Thrawn [[Death/Legends|died]] in [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], Stent remained loyal to him, and by [[19 ABY/Legends|19 ABY]], he was serving as [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] of Thrawn's [[Household Phalanx]], based at the [[Hand of Thrawn]] on [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]]. This was a \"rogue phalanx\" that was not part of the Chiss military and did not take orders from the Chiss government, but appears in practice to have operated under the command of [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[General/Legends|General]] [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]]. On at least one occasion, Stent explicitly identified the Phalanx as being under the authority of the [[Empire of the Hand]].\n\nStent was almost killed later that [[Standard year/Legends|year]] in a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Battle of Rhigar|raid]] while visiting a [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force]] [[Syndic Mitth'raw'nuruodo training academy|military academy]] on [[Rhigar]], but in [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], he appeared again at Nirauan.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' resolved Stent's death timeline problem, stating that Stent survived the attack on the Rhigar academy.<ref>''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Crisis of Faith]]''\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*{{GamerCite|7|Red Sky, Blue Flame}}\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' {{1stID|Kres'ten'tarthi}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GamerCite|5|The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life: The Chiss}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040226eu|text=Voss Parck|int=Voss Parck (article)|archivedate=20090602014438}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Unknown Regions]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kres'ten'tarthi\n|ja=\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30b7\n}}\n\n[[Category:Chiss]]\n[[Category:Empire of the Hand personnel]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nirauan residents]]\n[[Category:Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
