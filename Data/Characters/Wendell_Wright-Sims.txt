Oh, and yes, I'll have a package for you next week.|Wendell Wright-Sims|An Old Flame in Need...}}\n'''Wendell Wright-Sims''', a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], was a well-to-do [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] socialite and [[Coruscant/Legends|Imperial Center's]] premier [[Spice/Legends|spice]] [[Drug dealer|dealer]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Wright-Sims carried out his [[Merchant/Legends|trade]], despite its seemingly questionable nature on the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]], with the expressed permission of the [[Palpatine/Legends|Emperor]] himself, who used Wright-Sims' impeccable taste in quality spice to ensure his elite citizens indulged only in the finest product available in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Wright-Sims therefore humbled himself before the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor's]] good graces and also paid dues to [[Dark Prince]] [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]] of the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] crime syndicate, who prevented his own spice dealers from interfering in Wright-Sims' business as a professional courtesy. In turn, Wright-Sims frequently presented Xizor with several [[Kilogram/Legends|kilograms]] of the best-quality spice to maintain Black Sun's favor.\n\nWright-Sims did not indulge in his own merchandise, however, instead enjoying the extravagant lifestyle of Coruscant high society. He regularly attended elegant social functions with his spice-addicted, high-society Coruscanti clients as a means of ensuring he was catering to his market's needs. True to his nature as a Coruscanti socialite, Wright-Sims strove to maintain a fashionable, trendy appearance, both in [[Clothing/Legends|dress]] and [[Language/Legends|speech]], studying to make sure he wore the [[Standard day/Legends|day's]] latest styles and spoke with a practiced, cultured vernacular. A veritable master of the art of superficial flattery, Wright-Sims considered it part of his job to charm his addicted society peers so that he sold enough spice to live extremely comfortably.\n\n==Biography==\n===Coruscant's premier spice dealer===\nWendell Wright-Sims, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], was the premier importer and [[Drug dealer|dealer]] of the narcotic [[Spice/Legends|spice]] on the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] throne [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during the height of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. Whereas spice may have seemed like a natural commodity to be highly regulated, if not banned outright, on the Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]], Wright-Sims' spice-dealing venture nevertheless thrived with the expressed permission of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] himself. The [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] wished for the [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] elite to indulge only in the best-quality spice available, and so he allowed Wright-Sims&mdash;a man of impeccable taste in spice and the [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] who delivered the drug to Coruscant&mdash;to pursue his import [[Merchant/Legends|trade]]. Wright-Sims thus ensured that the spice flowing into Coruscant was the most refined of its kind in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], lest an inferior product should taint those considered the wealthiest and most fortunate members of [[Galactic community|galactic society]].<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />\n\nTo supplement his business, Wright-Sims, an affluent Coruscanti socialite in his own right, frequently attended social engagements with his Imperial Center clients to fulfill his market's needs. Be it chatting at a costume ball, dining at the exclusive [[Manarai]] [[Restaurant/Legends|restaurant]] in [[Galactic City|Imperial City]], or mixing with the regulars in the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace's]] public corridors,<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" /> Wright-Sims excelled at the brand of superficial social interaction with those whose needs he served that kept him selling enough spice to live extremely comfortably,<ref name=\"An Old Flame in Need\">{{WEGCite|book=Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook|story=An Old Flame in Need...|stext=''An Old Flame in Need...''}}</ref> and, in the process, he simply enjoyed the trappings that the high lifestyle of Coruscant society offered.<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />\n\nThe success of his spice trade notwithstanding, Wright-Sims was mindful to pay humble respect to his more powerful Coruscant society peers, specifically those who tolerated the continuation of his business. Wright-Sims recognized the generosity of the Emperor, for example, and was always willing to assist the Empire's emissaries. He also acknowledged the [[Dark Prince]] [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]], leader of the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] crime syndicate, who, as a professional courtesy, intentionally kept his own spice dealers out of Wright-Sims' business affairs. To demonstrate his appreciation<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" /> and maintain the Dark [[Prince/Legends|Prince's]] favor,<ref name=\"SOTE novel\">[[Shadows of the Empire (novel)|''Shadows of the Empire'' novel]]</ref> Wright-Sims often personally delivered to Xizor several [[Kilogram/Legends|kilograms]] of the choicest spice<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />&mdash;a cheap insurance for Wright-Sims, even though the spice allotment likely valued several million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] on the streets.<ref name=\"SOTE novel\" /> Xizor did not indulge in spice himself, but he appreciated the gesture nevertheless, perfectly aware that Wright-Sims was only doing what was necessary to curry favor among his clients and competitors.<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />\n\n===Reigniting an old flame===\n{{Quote|Seems like you have a lot on your mind.

Wright-Sims arrived at the party, packed with Coruscant's elite society, following ''The Kallea Cycle''{{'s}} first marathon portion, which he found exceedingly droll. Still, despite having to sit through the performance, he was prepared to be his usual charming self at the engagement, for this was part of his job as Imperial Center's premier spice dealer.<ref name=\"An Old Flame in Need\" />\n\nWith a head of finely pomaded [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and wearing that [[Standard week/Legends|week's]] designer evening [[Clothing/Legends|coattails]], Wright-Sims adroitly made his way through the party from one superficial discussion or debate to another&mdash;marveling at the training the opera's [[Musician/Legends|performers]] must have endured to sing for five [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] straight, criticizing the loathsome [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]] for [[Death/Legends|killing]] innocents until they were once more occupying the old [[Senate Building]], or gossiping about a purported scandal involving the late [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]] and a [[Natasi Daala|female aide]] [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before&mdash;all the while reinforcing his dedication to those addicted to his premium spice. In the course of his hobnobbing, Wright-Sims subtly promised spice delivery to the [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Amber Comark]], daughter of Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Jesco Comark]], and [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Miltin Takel]], both regular clients of his, in the coming days.<ref name=\"An Old Flame in Need\" />\n\nWright-Sims eventually ran into [[Mayli Weng]], an old flame of his, whom he had casually courted once at least two years before. Wright-Sims recalled his [[Time/Legends|time]] with Weng, a woman with an exceptional figure, friendly demeanor, and luxuriously long, [[Color/Legends|brown]] hair, as a pleasant time, though he could not remember the reason for their breakup. As Wright-Sims genially reintroduced himself to Weng with minor small talk and began casually escorting her to the gala's more quiet sidelines, away from the rest of the party guests, he silently noted that perhaps enduring the opera's five-hour performance was indeed going to be worth it.<ref name=\"An Old Flame in Need\" />\n\nHowever, Weng's courteousness disappeared once they were alone. She rebuked his obvious romantic advances, not wanting to open up old emotional wounds, with claims that they were both attending the party for the sake of the livelihood of their businesses&mdash;Weng was there as a representative of the [[Exotic Entertainers' Union]] to negotiate the mistreatment of her constituents. When Wright-Sims calmly pressed further and placed an [[Limb/Legends|arm]] around her shoulder, offering a diversion to her troubles, Weng moved to back away from him, rejecting any offer of his merchandise, if that was all he wanted. But selling more spice was not Wright-Sims' intention. Instead, he simply suggested they catch up on old times with one another, perhaps over some [[Foodstuff/Legends|appetizers]] from a server's tray and a bit of [[Cedrellian aged wine]]&mdash;a worry-free evening together, no strings attached.<ref name=\"An Old Flame in Need\" />\n\nWright-Sims then slowly led Weng by the hand toward the reception hall's terrace arches and the balcony [[Garden/Legends|garden]] beyond, charming her with a recitation of his own rendition of the [[Korfani]] [[Poet/Legends|poet]], [[Adranax]]: ''Why mourn for tomorrow in tears today/When current fleeting hours not long shall stay?/Come stroll with me, we shall find your lost peace/In an old friend's arms and a gentle kiss.''<ref name=\"An Old Flame in Need\" />\n\n===Xizor's last spice endowment===\nWright-Sims later paid a visit to [[Xizor's Palace]] in 3.5 [[Galactic Standard Calendar|ABY]], on the morning of the day before Xizor was ultimately killed in [[Battle over Coruscant|battle]] with elements of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], over the skies of Coruscant. Wright-Sims, whose appointment, in fact, shortly followed Mayli Weng's own appointment with Xizor on the same day, presented the Dark Prince with ten kilograms of the highest-grade spice, his regular contribution to ensure he maintained Black Sun's favor. Although Xizor refrained from using the spice, he preferred to have some on hand in the event his guests cared to indulge, in which case Xizor would be the hospitable host. As usual, price was no issue in the transaction, and Xizor thanked Wright-Sims before sending the man on his way.<ref name=\"SOTE novel\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Wendell, at times you can be annoyingly vapid.''\"<br />\"''And yet, you must admit, from time to time charm can often be a fulfilling substitute.|Mayli Weng and Wendell Wright-Sims|An Old Flame in Need...}}\nAlthough spice dealing may have seemed like a questionable pursuit to some, especially among the upper echelons of Coruscant society, Wendell Wright-Sims figured the Emperor's noble subjects deserved to enjoy themselves. And if the Coruscant citizenry remained addicted and docile as a result, thus serving the Emperor's needs, Wright-Sims was fine with that too. He was careful to know his place in the Coruscant society power structure, ready to oblige both the Empire and Black Sun for permitting him to pursue his trade. Wright-Sims did not indulge in his own merchandise, however. Rather, he found pleasure in the extravagant lifestyle of Coruscant society that being Imperial Center's leading spice dealer enabled him to live.<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />\n\nWright-Sims considered the life of a wealthy Coruscanti socialite to be merely part of his job as a spice dealer, and to that end he was constantly attending social functions with the Coruscant elite to market his product to his addicted clients. A product of the superficial and a master of complimentary banter, Wright-Sims was careful to always tailor a vogue appearance, which meant dressing in the day's latest fashions, pomading his whitened hair with fine fragrances, and maintaining a stylishly trim physique. He regularly followed the [[NewsNet|newsnets]] with an [[Eye/Legends|eye]] out for the latest \"hot trend,\" styled his [[Language/Legends|speech]] to employ the most popular catchphrases, and kept himself abreast of recent events that prepared him for the most cultured and sophisticated conversations. Wright-Sims could adeptly discuss the latest [[Politics/Legends|political]] developments, reflect on elitist societal ideals with the [[Human High Culture]] theorists, and speculate on [[Galaxy/Legends|galactic]] developments with a refined fluency.<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nWright-Sims possessed mechanical ability in beast riding and [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] operation.<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nWright-Sims's personal equipment included a [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] link to the newsnets and a [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]].<ref name=\"SOTE Sourcebook\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWendell Wright-Sims first appeared briefly in the [[May (month)|May]] [[1996]] [[Shadows of the Empire (novel)|''Shadows of the Empire'' novel]], written by [[Steve Perry]], as one of the many business underlings who pays his dues to Prince Xizor of Black Sun.<ref name=\"SOTE novel\" /> The character's biographical background, based on his role as a spice peddler in the novel, was greatly expanded upon in the [[June]] 1996 ''[[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook]]'', by [[Peter M.
