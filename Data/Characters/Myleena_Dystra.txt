You're under arrest! Throw down your weapons or I'll shoot!|NRSF Agent Myleena Dystra|Heroes & Rogues}}\n'''Myleena Dystra''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who served as an [[Agent/Legends|agent]] with the [[New Republic Security Force]]. Born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to wealthy [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] [[Parent/Legends|parents]], Dystra grew up in the environment of [[Dystra estate|palatial estates]] and private schools. She was placed in a [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] [[readjustment camp]] run by the Imperial [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order/Legends|Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]] at age thirteen. Her parents had been arrested, never to be seen again, as [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] sympathizers in the aftermath of the [[Dissolution of the Imperial Senate/Legends|dissolution of the Imperial Senate]]. Dystra was rescued from the readjustment camp by Rebel Alliance [[Alliance Special Operations|Special Operations]] and placed in a [[Rebel Alliance foster home|foster home]]. Wanting to honor her parents' sacrifice, Dystra entered [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|law enforcement]] for the new [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government, the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], becoming an agent with the New Republic Security Force. She quickly rose to become an effective [[Police officer/Legends|police officer]] with a high arrest record. However, in her eagerness, Dystra took frequent, unnecessary risks, and she was twice wounded in action.\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], Myleena Dystra was born on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]]<ref name=\"EAOC\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-atlas-online-companion|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Atlas'' Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}}</ref> [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] in [[13 BBY/Legends|13 BBY]], during the reign of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Dystra's [[Myleena Dystra's mother|mother]] and [[Myleena Dystra's father|father]] were affluent [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]], and Dystra grew up in a [[Dystra estate|palatial estate]] on Coruscant and attended private schools. When [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] [[Dissolution of the Imperial Senate/Legends|disbanded]] the [[Imperial Senate/Legends|Imperial Senate]]<ref name=\"H&R\" /> in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]],<ref name=\"GNN\">{{Journal|3|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref> the [[Senate Building]] was taken over by Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], who detained hundreds of individuals for questioning and to issue arrest warrants. Dystra's [[Parent/Legends|parents]] were two of those detained. They were never released, and Dystra did not see them again. She later discovered they had an affiliation with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], also known as the Rebel Alliance, which sought to overthrow the Empire. Now effectively an orphan, Dystra was taken under the wing of the Empire's [[Politics/Legends|political]] bureaucracy, the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order/Legends|Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]] (COMPNOR), and sent to a [[readjustment camp]] to be [[Imperialization/Legends|indoctrinated]] on Imperial [[New Order/Legends|philosophy]].<ref name=\"H&R\" />\n\nShortly after Dystra entered the COMPNOR camp, a Rebel Alliance [[Alliance Special Operations|Special Operations]] team rescued her, and she was taken to a Rebel [[Safe world/Legends|safeworld]]. There, she was placed in a [[Rebel Alliance foster home]] and was brought up to appreciate her parents' sacrifice. As she grew older, Dystra became determined to join the cause of her parents. After the Rebel Alliance formed the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], which replaced the Empire as the dominate [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government, Dystra became an [[Agent/Legends|agent]] with the [[New Republic Security Force]] (NRSF). She quickly established herself as a highly effective [[Police officer/Legends|police officer]] with an impressive record of arrests. She also was involved in several major engagements and was wounded in two separate incidents. She narrowly escaped [[Death/Legends|death]] during the second [[Time/Legends|time]] she was wounded in action.<ref name=\"H&R\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMyleena Dystra was a young and enthusiastic woman determined to do justice for the cause in which she and her parents believed. Eager and energetic, she threw herself into her work as an NRSF agent. However, Dystra's enthusiasm also caused her to put herself into harm's way unnecessarily. In her eagerness, she frequently took risks and shortcuts to make arrests. Twice Dystra found herself in dangerous situations during which she was wounded.<ref name=\"H&R\" />\n\nA physically fit person, Dystra was trained in both [[unarmed combat]] and [[Melee weapon/Legends|melee weaponry]], including [[Stun baton/Legends|stun batons]]. She was also proficient with the use of [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], with a specialty in wielding heavy [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]]. She was also capable in climbing and swimming, and had a high physical stamina. Dystra had knowledge in [[Astrogation/Legends|astrogation]] and could [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Transport/Legends|transports]], [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] vehicles, and [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]], most notably the [[BTL Y-wing starfighter/Legends|Y-wing]], which she used as her issued fighter. She was skilled in repairing [[Armor/Legends|armor]], blasters, and had [[Computer/Legends|computer]] repair knowledge. She was also trained in first aid.<ref name=\"H&R\" />\n\nAs a [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police]] [[Officer/Legends|officer]], Dystra had knowledge of various [[Species/Legends|species]], [[Language/Legends|languages]], and [[Star system/Legends|planetary systems]]. She was also thoroughly trained in law enforcement tactics, specifically [[Detective/Legends|investigations]]. Her streetwise knowledge gave her the ability to bargain, and she was adept at being covert.<ref name=\"H&R\" />\n\nFor her duties, Dystra wore an NRSF [[Clothing/Legends|uniform]] as well as her badge and ID, a blaster pistol, [[Stun cuffs|binder cuffs]], stun baton, and her [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]]. Dystra also had an [[R2-series astromech droid|R2 astromech droid]] that would accompany her.<ref name=\"H&R\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMyleena Dystra was first mentioned in ''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'', a [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] informational book published by [[West End Games]] in [[June]] [[1995]] and written by [[Paul Sudlow]] and [[Rick D. Stuart]] as a supplement to ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]''.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dystra, Myleena}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:New Republic Security Force agents]]"}}}]}}}}
