When the [[Onderon rebels/Legends|Onderon rebels]] began to cause havoc by fighting against the Separatists, Tandin remained loyal to the king. However, he was in constant disagreement with [[super tactical droid]] [[Kalani/Legends|Kalani]], who was sent to Onderon by [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]]. Tandin attempted to convince Rash that the rebels were only targeting the droid army, and suggested that allowing the [[Royal Guard (Onderon)|Royal Onderon Militia]] to assume control of security could convince the rebels to stop and discuss terms. Kalani denied him, stating that the rebels may have had sympathizers among the militia's own ranks. Tandin insisted the threat was external and the droid reinforcements had done little to stop it. Rash interjected that they would not negotiate with the rebels, whom he referred to as \"terrorists\". Tandin then notified the king of [[Steela Gerrera/Legends|Steela Gerrera]] and her brother [[Saw Gerrera/Legends|Saw's]] involvement in the rebel movement, along with [[Lux Bonteri/Legends|Lux Bonteri]], son of the [[Death/Legends|deceased]] [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Mina Bonteri/Legends|Mina Bonteri]].\n\n[[File:TandinSaw-TSW.png|thumb|left|250px|Tandin confers with the rebel Saw Gerrera.]]\nLater that night, [[Saw Gerrera/Legends|Saw Gerrera]], one of the leaders of the rebellion, was captured while attempting to rescue [[Ramsis Dendup/Legends|Ramsis Dendup]] from execution. He was subjected to torture by Kalani to extract his cohorts' location. Tandin refused to have him tortured any longer and decided to have him alive in order to find rebels. In questioning the young man, Saw sowed the seeds of doubt within Tandin.\n\nLater that day, Tandin witnessed the near-execution of Dendup and the occurrence of the rebels. When they were surrounded and all seemed lost, Tandin led all the palace guards to serve by his side and prevent the execution from happening. They surrounded the battle droids while Tandin took Rash as hostage for a short time. He gave the rebels and guards a chance to escape since he was willing to sacrifice his life for them. But before the [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] were about to take aim, [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]] jumped out of the crowd and saved the [[General/Legends|general]] and both escaped, allowing all the civilians to turn against the false King Rash for his lies. In the shelter, Tandin and the royal guards pledged their support to the rebels and their true King.\n\nThe rebels soon moved out of the city into the wilderness to draw the droids away from Iziz. Tandin consented to [[Steela Gerrera/Legends|Steela Gerrera's]] leadership when Dendup appointed her as leader of both their forces. However, Kalani dispatched droid gunships to aid the droid army to destroy the rebellion. The rebels were on the brink of defeat, until [[Hondo Ohnaka/Legends|Hondo Ohnaka]] delivered rocket launchers on behalf of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]. They were able to defeat the droids, forcing the Separatists to abandon Onderon and kill Rash. Sadly, the victory was with great cost, as Steela died during the final battle. Tandin was present at her funeral in Iziz as Onderon celebrated its liberation.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Tandin_hand_tatoo.png|thumb|100px|General Tandin's hand tattoo]]\nA male Human, General Tandin measured 1.77 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] and had broad shoulders. At the time of the Clone Wars, he was a mature gentleman who sported grey, short-cropped [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and a wide mustache. His [[Color/Legends|blueish]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] were surmounted by thick eyebrows.
