Kill me...|Garil Dox|Empire 35}}\n'''Garil Dox''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served as a [[Gunner/Legends|gunner]] on the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Reprisal (Imperial II-class)|''Reprisal'']] during the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nAfter the destruction of his homeworld, [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] Dox's faith in the Empire was severely shaken. He continued to operate as usual at his post, until the day [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] himself visited the ''Reprisal'' in pursuit of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebels]]. Vader's intention was to capture and interrogate rebels in order to locate the Rebel fleet. Dox intended to prevent this at any cost.\n\nVader ordered [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Demmings]] to perform strikes on the rebels and acquire captives, however three attempts yielded no survivors. Initially, Vader attributed the blunders to Demmings' incompetence, however soon realized that it was Dox who purposely left no survivors.\n\n[[File:Garil_Dox2.jpg|thumb|left|Garil Dox arrested by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].]]\n\nWhat Dox had not realized, however, was that Vader and Demmings eventually realized his heritage as an Alderaanian, and that the third target on [[Ejolus]] was an Alderaanian refugee camp that the two passed off as a rebel base. When this was revealed to him, Dox was shattered by the knowledge that he had [[Destruction of the Ejolus outpost|wiped out]] perhaps the only remaining Alderaanians in the galaxy, and begged Vader to kill him.\n\nVader had other plans for Dox however, and sent him off to an Imperial labor camp.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Empire 35|''Empire'' 35]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Garil Dox\n|nl=Garil Dox\n|pl=Garil Dox\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dox, Garil}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
