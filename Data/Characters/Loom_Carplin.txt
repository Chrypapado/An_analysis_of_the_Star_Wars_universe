A founding member of the [[Mantooine Liberators]], Carplin was the highest-ranking survivor of the resistance group after it was [[Battle of Mantooine|crushed]] by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces.

Due to medical conditions that confined her to a [[Power chair|repulsorchair]], Carplin acted as Chan's eyes and ears, constantly traveling throughout the sector and even taking charge of critical missions. Carplin was assisted by [[Busurra]], a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]]; Busurra acted in Carplin's stead when the latter was off base on a mission.<ref name=\"RASB\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBig and strong with long mutton chops, Carplin was a warrior first and foremost.

He was also adept at [[unarmed combat]], and the deployment of [[Grenade/Legends|grenades]]. Physically fit, Carplin was a strong swimmer, and trained in stealth and survival techniques. His experience as Chief of Staff gave him a working knowledge of the operation of a [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucracy]], as well as knowledge about [[Alien/Legends|alien]] languages and planetary [[Star system/Legends|star systems]]. Carplin also knew how to contact the criminal underworld if needed. His mechanical and technical proficiencies included being able to drive [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] vehicles, operate demolitions equipment, apply first aid, and bypass security systems.<ref name=\"RASB2\">[[The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook (Second Edition)|''The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook'', Second Edition]]</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nCarplin was armed with a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], and carried a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] and [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]].<ref name=\"RASB2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLoom Carplin was created for the ''[[The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook]]'' by [[West End Games]].
