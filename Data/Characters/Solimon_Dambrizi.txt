He followed in his father and grandfather's footsteps and joined the police force in the city of [[Adjesk]]. He excelled as an officer and detective, mostly due to his mysterious sixth sense that helped him avoid danger.\n\nHe discovered an old [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jedi lorebook|lorebook]] during a raid on a black market warehouse, and used it to learn the origin of his insight and abilities. He constructed a burgundy bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and left Corulag to study in the ways of the Force.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nSolimon was intelligent and insightful. He had a strong heroic streak which had led him into some trouble in the past. Since leaving to become a Jedi he frequented seedier establishments in hopes of avoiding contact with [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOn his own Solimon was able to learn some basic [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] including [[Accelerate Healing]], [[Force sense/Legends|Force sense]] and to [[Detoxify Poison]]. He had quite a lot of talent but did not progress as quickly as expected, possibly due to his learning being self-taught out of an ancient tome that was in poor condition.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSolimon Dambrizi was designed by [[Paul Danner]] and [[Bill Smith]] for ''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'', a supplement for the ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' that was published by [[West End Games]] in [[1997]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Dambrizi,Solimon}}\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]"}}}]}}}}
