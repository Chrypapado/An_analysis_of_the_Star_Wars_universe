When the [[Despot War]] erupted in the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[25,805 BBY]] with the [[Despot Queen]] [[Hadiya]]'s attempts to conquer the Tython system, Lok went undercover in Hadiya's [[Despot Army]] and became one of Hadiya's [[General/Legends|generals]], not to mention her lover. Lok ultimately [[Death/Legends|killed]] Hadiya, ending the war, and he was promoted to the rank of Master in [[25,800 BBY]]. Overconfident in his abilities, Lok ventured into the [[Chasm]], a rent in the surface of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tython/Legends|Tython]] that drove mad all who dove too deep into its depths. There, Lok witnessed a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] of an [[Army/Legends|army]] of dark warriors wielding [[Forcesaber|blades of fire]], and the vision drove the Je'daii mad, driving him to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. The [[Je'daii Council]] refused to believe Lok's vision and banished him to the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Bogan]], but the mad Je'daii held onto his vision, gathering his power in the dark side of the Force for the next seven years.\n\nIn [[25,793 BBY]], Lok received a vision of the [[Tau (individual)|dark warrior]] who led the army in his vision in the Chasm, and the young man&mdash;Xesh&mdash;arrived on Bogan as an exile only [[Standard day/Legends|days]] later. Upon learning of Xesh's knowledge of the blades of fire, which he called Forcesabers, Lok recruited Xesh in his quest to create more of the weapons and thereby prove his vision to the Council. The two escaped Tython in a hidden [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] in order to craft Forcesabers, pursued all the while by the Je'daii, who battled the two fugitives several times before a final encounter on the planet Shikaakwa. Lok's dreams of conquest were ended when Xesh was convinced to turn on the mad Je'daii, and Lok was imprisoned once more on Bogan as the Je'daii began to prepare for war with the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] [[Infinite Empire]]. However, as the Empire [[Invasion of the Tython system|gained more ground]], Lok was freed from Bogan and allowed to lead the Je'daii as a [[General/Legends|general]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and the war===\n{{Quote|There was this big war on Tython about twelve years ago&mdash;I ended it&mdash;and some enemy fighters here on Bogan during the final battle.|Daegen Lok|Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 1}}\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], Daegen Lok was born in the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]] and trained as a member of the [[Je'daii Order]]<ref name=\"DOTJ 0\" /> by [[Quan-Jang]], the [[Je'daii Temple Master|Temple Master]] of [[Anil Kesh]]&mdash;the [[Je'daii Temples|Je'daii Temple]] of Science on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Tython/Legends|Tython]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 4\" /> During his [[Time/Legends|time]] as a Je'daii, Lok had an adventure on the planet [[Sunspot/Legends|Sunspot]], the closest planet to the [[Star/Legends|star]] [[Tythos]] in the system, and while there he rescued the [[Koorivar/Legends|alien]] [[Slug (Koorivar)|Slug]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 8\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 3]]</ref> Lok became friends with [[Hawk Ryo]], a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] Je'daii from the planet [[Shikaakwa]], and the two had become [[Je'daii Ranger]]s before the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[25,805 BBY]], when the [[Despot War]] erupted: a conflict between the Je'daii Order and the [[Despot Army]] under the rule of the [[Despot Queen]] [[Hadiya]]. After uniting the crime [[Baron/Legends|barons]] of Shikaakwa, Hadiya began to try and conquer the Tython system. Lok was approached by [[Volnos Ryo]], Hawk's brother and the middle son of the [[Volnos Ryo's father|baron]] of [[Clan Ryo]] on Shikaakwa, who offered to help Lok infiltrate the Despot Army to gain revenge against Hadiya for her killing his father and [[Volnos Ryo's brother|older brother]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 10\" />\n\n[[File:Daegen_and_Hadiya.png|thumb|right|110px|Lok stabs Hadiya.]]\nPosing as a disgraced Ranger with Ryo's support, Lok joined the Despot Army and rose through the ranks, earning a place as one of Hadiya's [[General/Legends|generals]] and even becoming the queen's lover. Lok himself developed feelings for Hadiya, and the line between his deception and his true mission began to blur until Volnos Ryo contacted him and reminded him of his purpose. At that time, the Despot Army on Tython itself, laying siege to the [[Kaleth]], the Temple of Knowledge, and Lok slept in Hadiya's tent with the queen. That night, as Hadiya was sleeping, Lok stabbed her with a dagger through a slit in her [[Armor/Legends|armor]]. However, his hesitation&mdash;[[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] was forbidden among the Je'daii, and Lok's feelings for Hadiya were also a factor&mdash;led Lok's strike to not be fatal, and Hadiya grabbed a dagger of her own and sliced Lok's face across his right [[Eye/Legends|eye]]. Enraged, Lok drew his [[Sword/Legends|sword]] and slew Hadiya, and he then proceeded to slaughter his way out of the command camp, leaving only one survivor.<ref name=\"DOTJ 10\" /> Without Hadiya's leadership, Hadiya's generals fought for power amongst each other, and the Je'daii soon defeated the remnants of the Despot Army.<ref name=\"DOTJ 1\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 1]]</ref>\n\n===Visions in the darkness and exile===\n{{Quote|I told the Council about my vision.

Brash and overconfident in his power, Lok ignored the fact that the Chasm messed with the minds of any who entered, and he ignored Ryo's cautions against heading deeper into the Chasm. However, as Lok gazed deeper into the darkness, both he and Ryo were overcome by a [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]]<ref name=\"DOTJ 6\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 1]]</ref> of an army of dark warriors wielding [[Forcesaber|blades of frozen fire]] marching across [[Ska Gora]],<ref name=\"DOTJ 7\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 2]]</ref> led by a [[Tau (individual)|being with one red eye]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 6\" /> In Lok's vision, he led the Je'daii against them.<ref name=\"DOTJ 10\" />\n\nThe vision drove Lok insane, driving him into the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and Ryo pushed aside his vision to pull the two of them up out of the Chasm. When questioned by the [[Je'daii Council]], Lok told them of his vision and warned them of the coming danger. However, the Council did not believe Lok's vision, and as Lok continued to wallow in the dark side, using the Force to manipulate the minds of others. As a result, both Lok and Ryo were exiled to the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Bogan]], where the two were ordered to meditate on the Force and restore their inner balance. Ryo came to deny his vision and found balance once more, but Lok refused to forsake his vision and the dark side. Over the next seven years, Lok figured out how to remove the cuffs that kept prisoners separate, and he also discovered a crashed [[Pho-V fighter]] that had escaped the Je'daii{{'s}} notice. In his madness, Lok carved an enormous carving of himself wielding the blade of fire, and numerous pictures of the weapon.<ref name=\"DOTJ 6\" />\n\nIn [[25,793 BBY]], Lok witnessed a second Force vision&mdash;an apparition of an armed warrior, wearing a helmet with a single red eye and possessing the blade of fire.<ref name=\"DOTJ 2\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 2]]</ref> It was the same warrior who led the dark army in his vision,<ref name=\"DOTJ 6\" /> and Lok watched from Bogan as Tython was enveloped in a fierce [[Force storm (weather)|Force Storm]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 3\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 3]]</ref> A few days later, the dark warrior arrived on Bogan, having been exiled there by the Je'daii. Two [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after that, Lok decided to test the stranger's powers and attacked him, using a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind twist]] to manipulate his opponent's mind. The stranger overcame him quickly and displayed the ability to generate [[Force lightning/Legends|lightning]], but Lok stopped his attack by asking him why the stranger appeared to him in a vision. When Lok questioned the stranger about his name, the young man introduced himself as Xesh, a [[Force Hound]] of the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 6\" />\n\nLok freed Xesh from his cuffs, hiding them underneath the young man's blankets to fool the sentry [[Droid/Legends|droids]], and then took Xesh to the cave where his Pho V fighter was crashed. Lok then told the stranger the story of his vision and his exile, but Xesh's recognition of the carvings that Lok had made of the blade of fire brought his story to an abrupt halt. Excited, Lok demanded that Xesh help him make more of the \"Forcesabers,\" but Lok showed Xesh that the ship's power cells were completely empty&mdash;only to be astonished when Xesh generated lightning to power the cells, restoring the ship's power. As Xesh continued his efforts to restore power, he soon began to overload the reactor, and Lok angered the young warrior when he pulled Xesh away from the cells. As Xesh rested, Lok piloted the ship and lifted off from Bogan before setting course for Krev Coeur, all the while contemplating whether or not allying with Xesh was a good idea.<ref name=\"DOTJ 6\" />\n\n===Building weapons and an army===\n[[File:Killing_Slug.png|thumb|right|160px|Lok attempts to eliminate a loose end.]]\n{{Quote|You want us to follow you because you had a ''vision''?''\"<br />\"''Yes! Now you understand. And make no mistake&mdash;you ''will'' follow me.|Shri-Lan and Lok|Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 4}}\nHowever, as they approached the crystalline planet of [[Krev Coeur]], the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] began to fail as the engines overloaded and the controls stopped responding. As Xesh awoke and came to the cockpit, they entered the [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]] of Krev Coeur and started to crash, prompting the two to grab [[Parachute/Legends|parachutes]] and leap to safety.<ref name=\"DOTJ 7\" /> On Krev Coeur, Lok sought out Slug, who was on the world, and he called in the favor Slug owed him from Sunspot. Slug led them to a particularly valuable reserve of [[Crystal/Legends|crystals]], which Xesh began to peruse to find the crystals necessary to create Forcesabers. When Slug objected to Xesh's selection, Lok mind-tricked Slug into accepting the deal&mdash;but when Slug began to discuss the rumors that Lok had gone mad and asked for payment so that he would not tell the Je'daii about his presence on Krev Coeur, Lok threw Slug off of the nearby cliff.<ref name=\"DOTJ 8\" />\n\nFortunately for Slug, a Je'daii Ranger named [[Bel Zana]] reached out with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and saved him, and Zana then ordered the two fugitives to stand down. As Xesh leapt to confront Zana, Lok reached into Zana's mind and discovered her fear of fire, leading him to use a mind twist on the Ranger. Lok's power over her mind was so total that Zana's body itself believed it was on fire and began to manifest burn marks, though Temple Master [[Jake Fenn]] and [[Je'daii Journeyer]] [[Sek'nos Rath]] arrived to support Zana. Fenn engaged Lok in battle, and though Fenn scored an early strike on Lok, the mad Je'daii gained the upper hand over the Temple Master by pretending to be weakened. Reaching into Fenn's mind, Lok discovered his feelings for Zana and proceeded to cast the Ranger off the cliff. Sek'nos Rath sacrificed himself to save Zana, but Xesh and Lok escaped in Fenn's moment of distraction.<ref name=\"DOTJ 8\" />\n\n[[File:Lok_and_generals.png|thumb|left|200px|Daegen Lok recruits Hadiya's generals.]]\nThe two made their way to the factory world of [[Nox]], where Lok secured them use of one of the factories, [[Gratz Foundry]], by mind-tricking its owner [[Gratz]] into believing that his factory had been invaded by [[nashtah]]. Lok shaved and washed off the filth of his imprisonment before donning a suit of leather armor, and also procured a set of armor that Xesh requested while the Force Hound set to work making the Forcesabers and altering the crystals to work in the weapons. When the process was complete, Xesh gave one of the weapons to Lok and told him how the blade was powered by the dark side, though Lok showed himself perfectly capable of igniting the blade. The next stage of Lok's plan involved gathering an army,<ref name=\"DOTJ 8\" /> so he and Lok sought out Hadiya's four remaining generals&mdash;[[Bakko]], [[Shri-Lan]], [[Gav Vannar]], and [[Ka'un Damm]]&mdash;in [[Skrag's Cantina]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Boneyard (Nox)|Boneyard]]. A hooded Lok introduced Xesh to the four criminals before revealing his face, and Xesh and Lok made quick work of the [[Slugthrower/Legends|slugthrowers]] that the four drew on Lok when they recognized him. Holding them at bladepoint, Lok asked them to return to Shikaakwa with him and help gather an army to take Tython.<ref name=\"DOTJ 9\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 4]]</ref>\n\nIgnoring their skepticism, Lok explained his desire to save the Je'daii from the army in his vision, but Xesh interrupted their conversation by informing Lok that the Je'daii were tracking them. Xesh and Lok left the cantina only minutes before Hawk Ryo arrived, and Lok and Xesh split up as Ryo began to follow Lok&mdash;but Lok manipulated his friend's mind with a mind trick, causing Ryo to pursue an imaginary version of himself while the real Lok headed towards the nearby spaceport. The imaginary Lok briefly battled Ryo and demanded that the Ranger admit to having shared the vision in the Chasm before leaping off the side of a building, and the real Lok met up at the spaceport with Xesh, who had captured one of his pursuers&mdash;a Journeyer named [[Shae Koda]].<ref name=\"DOTJ 9\" />\n\n===Battle on Shikaakwa and imprisonment===\n{{Quote|You want the Je'daii to forsake the ''balance''?!''\"<br />\"''Balance will not serve against the kind of power that Xesh alone exhibits&mdash;and he is one of the aliens{{'}} ''slaves''!

Placating Koda with a mind trick, Lok led Xesh and Koda to [[Ryo Fortress]], the headquarters of Clan Ryo, and used a mind trick to bluff his way into the building. Locating Baron Volnos in his personal chambers, Lok explained his plans to unite the remaining Hadiya loyalists on Shikaakwa into an army, and Lok countered Ryo's exclamations of belief by reminding the baron how he himself had had a hand in Hadiya's death by helping Lok infiltrate the Despot Army. An angry Ryo deployed a security droid that targeted both Xesh and Ryo with lasers, but when Ryo implied that Xesh was Lok's servant, the infuriated Force Hound pulled Ryo into the line of fire with the Force before using his Forcesaber to bat back the droid's fire and destroy it. Further conversation was forestalled by the arrival of Hawk Ryo, Ranger Rori Fenn, Sek'nos Rath, and a stranger named [[Trill (Force Hound)|Trill]] who demanded that Lok and Xesh surrender.<ref name=\"DOTJ 10\" />\n\n[[File:Lok_slash.png|thumb|right|160px|Lok removes Ryo's leg.]]\nReaching out with the Force, Lok pulled down the ceiling of the chamber and ordered Xesh to grab Koda and follow as he leaped out onto the roof. Lok and Xesh split up to separate their pursuers, and Lok swiftly destroyed Rori Fenn's sword with his Forcesaber when the Ranger attacked him. As he knelt over the downed Je'daii and prepared to toy with her mind, Hawk Ryo delivered a flying kick to Lok's jaw to knock him away. Drawing their Forcesabers, the two began to duel as Lok pried into Ryo's mind and overwhelmed him with memories of the vision they shared in the Chasm. Ryo disrupted Lok's attempts by throwing him against a nearby wall with the Force, and Lok expressed his fury and disgust with his former friend about how he had refused to acknowledge the truth of their vision&mdash;and how he refused to acknowledge the fact that the Je'daii would only survive if they embraced the dark side. Xesh's arrival gave Lok the time he needed to recover his Forcesaber, and he sliced off Ryo's leg below the knee as the Ranger was battling Xesh. However, Ryo's cry of pain awoke Koda, who overcame Lok's mental influence and attacked Lok with Ryo's fallen Forcesaber.\n\nLok ordered Xesh to kill Koda so that he could kill Ryo, but Koda convinced the Force Hound to make his own choices&mdash;to choose not to be a slave&mdash;and Xesh turned on Lok, promising never to be anyone's slave ever again. Angered at Xesh's betrayal, Lok reached into Xesh's mind, but doing so was a mistake&mdash;the darkness and pain in Xesh's mind overwhelmed Lok and almost knocked him unconscious. The Je'daii promptly captured Lok and returned him to Tython, where the Je'daii Council sentenced him to imprisonment on Bogan once more. During his sentencing, Lok demanded that the Masters force Hawk Ryo to confess what he saw in the Chasm, and he promised the Je'daii that they would have to summon him back when the dark army from his vision arrived. Temple Master [[Ketu]] did in fact speak with Ryo about the vision, though Ryo admitted that their visions had been different&mdash;in Ryo's vision, it had been Xesh who had led the Je'daii, not Lok.<ref name=\"DOTJ 10\" />\n\n===Leading the Je'daii===\n{{Quote|There are some who will ask if our sacrifice here today was in vain&hellip; they will ask if Shikaakwa was worth dying for.

The Je'daii had been able to [[First battle of Tython|repel]] the Rakata from Tython, though the invaders had taken [[Obri]], [[Mawr]], and [[Ska Gora]], and the [[Settled Worlds]] had allied with the Je'daii under the leadership of Master [[Rajivari]]. In [[25,792 BBY]], the Je'daii predicted the Rakatan [[Battle of Shikaakwa|attack]] on Shikaakwa, and Lok's forces ambushed the [[Flesh Raider]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] as they attempted to attack Ryo Fortress. Lok discovered the main Rakatan position, but when he encountered a number of large walkers, he fled their destructive firepower and encountered Xesh. Xesh identified the attackers as [[Rakatan annihilator]]s, and at Xesh's instruction, Lok ordered Hawk Ryo's squadrons to conduct a strafing run on their position despite the presence of Je'daii in the area. The attack was successful in destroying the annihilators and blunting the main Rakatan assault, and Lok called for Rajivari to send all of their forces to converge on his position.<ref name=\"DOTJ 11\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 1|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 1]]</ref>\n\nJoined by the units under Masters [[Tave]], Quan-Jang, and [[Tem Madog]], Lok's forces overran the Rakatan position, forcing the Rakatan [[Sub-Predor]] [[Ceh'let]] to withdraw back to Ska Gora. At Xesh's warning, the Je'daii were forced to wipe out the Flesh Raiders to the last man, as their enemies would never surrender, and Lok slew dozens of the enemy before the battle ended.
