He was an [[elder]] of the village and adviser to its [[Chief/Legends|chief]], [[Chief Kerritamba|Kerritamba]].\n\n==History==\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1.5 ABY]], Kerritamba Village was at war with another group within the Kkowir Forest known as the [[Outcasts (Kashyyyk)|Outcasts]]. Ardon tasked the village's new [[Arena Champion]], a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]], with two tasks to further combat the Outcast threat. Ardon instructed the spacer to enter the Outcast's lair and defeat 5 of their [[Assassin/Legends|assassins]]. When the spacer returned, they were rewarded with 5,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. The final task that Ardon set upon the spacer was to take out one of the Outcast's top officials, a [[Sanyassan]] known as [[Exemplar (title)|Exemplar]] [[Zheus]]. The spacer located Zheus, who was skulking around the [[Great Tree (Kashyyyk)|Spirit of Nyenthi'Oris]], and slew him. The spacer returned to Ardon, who rewarded them with 5,000 credits and named them the Blood Hunter of Kerritamba Village.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nArdon is a non-playable character in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.
