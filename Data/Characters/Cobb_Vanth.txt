Once a [[Slavery|slave]], he rose to become a [[sheriff]] of [[Mos Pelgo]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]]. He despised the [[Red Key Raiders]], a syndicate attempting to establish itself on the planet. Immediately following the [[Battle of Endor]], Vanth fled into the [[Dune Sea|desert]] following Mos Pelgo's takeover by the [[Mining Collective]]. He then encountered some [[Jawa]]s and traded a [[camtono]] of [[silicax oxalate]] crystals for a [[Boba Fett's armor|set]] of [[Mandalorian armor]].\n\nJust then, Red Key employee [[Adwin Charu]] approached the [[sandcrawler]]. Vanth conversed with Charu and helped the man find valuable equipment on the vehicle. When Charu found the armor and wished to take it for himself, Vanth injured Charu, leaving him alive to send a message to his boss [[Lorgan Movellan]]. Vanth returned to town and single-handedly [[Liberation of Mos Pelgo|drove away]] the Collective, assuming the role of [[mayor]] and protector of Mos Pelgo.\n\nAs sheriff and mayor of Mos Pelgo, which was eventually renamed Freetown, Vanth led the residents in defying the Red Key Raiders. In [[5 ABY]], he rescued the [[beastmaster]] [[Malakili]] from a pair of raiders. Vanth recruited the beastmaster to tend to some [[ronto]]s in Freetown and an infant [[Borgo|Hutt]] which had been acquired from the Red Key Raiders.\n\nSometime later, the Red Key [[Skirmish in Freetown|attacked]] and captured Freetown, overpowering the residents. Movellan confronted Vanth, both questioning each other's motives on Tatooine. The Hutt was then brought out with Malakili, and it gave a shriek, signaling [[Tusken Raider]] reinforcements against the Red Key Raiders. Vanth then carved a message onto Movellan for the crime boss's superiors.\n\nBy [[9 ABY]], the town was once again known as Mos Pelgo, and Vanth still led and defended the town, including battling Tusken Raiders who raided their village multiple times. At one point, the [[Mandalorian]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Din Djarin]] came to town searching for a fellow Mandalorian. Vanth agreed to give Djarin his armor in exchange for helping him [[Mission to Tatooine (Din Djarin)|kill]] a [[krayt dragon]] that lived nearby. Vanth and Djarin allied themselves with a local group of Tusken Raiders as well as the people of Mos Pelgo and succeeded in defeating the beast, after which Vanth gave Djarin the armor and parted ways with him.\n\n==Biography==\n===Sheriff on Tatooine===\n{{Quote|Afraid the Republic is back and gonna put their boot down on all the lowlifes and scum-lickers, the syndicates are trying to find new ways to appear legit.

After days wandering around, lost without food or water, Vanth eventually collapsed and was discovered by a group of [[Jawa]] [[scavenger]]s. After giving him water aboard their [[sandcrawler]], the Jawas opened the camtono and realized that it was filled with [[silicax oxalate]] crystals. Vanth was offered multiple objects for the crystals, including an [[astromech droid]], but Vanth refused them all, instead pointing to a set of damaged [[Mandalorian armor]],<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" /> which once belonged to the [[bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett]].<ref name=\"Episode VI\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars:'' Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref>\n\n===Acquiring Mandalorian armor===\n{{Quote|Mandalorian battle armor.

Greeting Charu, Vanth identified the representative as an off-worlder. After Adwin asked how Vanth knew, the sheriff told the Red Key employee that he looked too clean and did not know that the Jawas worked on rapport. Charu insisted that he did not have time to build rapport with Jawas and expressed the thought of visiting Mos Pelgo instead. Vanth agreed that the town or the<ref name=\"Aftermath\" /> [[spaceport]] [[city]]<ref name=\"Databank Mos Espa\">{{Databank|mos-espa|Mos Espa|archivedate=20170905102416}}</ref> [[Mos Espa]] could help, and Charu attempted to leave.

The Red Key employee agreed, and asked for the sheriff's name, which the [[Police officer|lawman]] willingly stated. Vanth then negotiated with the Jawas, promising that both he and Charu had [[credit]]s. Two Jawas led the pair to a room containing droids, weapons, and the wreckage of a [[Khetanna|Hutt sail barge]]. Vanth and Charu looked around the room until Vanth asked Charu if he was with the \"Red Key Company,\" which the representative admitted, and mentioned the Tatooine's vacuum that the company could fill.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nCharu then eyed the [[Boba Fett's armor|Mandalorian armor]], which he wished to bring to Movellan. Vanth made note of his desire to take the armor with him instead. Charu shut down Vanth, and the sheriff revealed his title to the Red Key employee. As Adwin then threatened to draw his [[blaster]], Vanth drew his own and shot the representative in the shoulder. After explaining his disgust of the Red Key Raiders, the sheriff claimed that he was bringing law to a lawless place. Charu begged Vanth not to [[Death|kill]] him, and the lawman asked the representative to tell Movellan to leave the [[Arkanis sector|sector]].<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n===Protecting Freetown===\n{{Quote|We got a couple [of] unruly rontos that could use a steady hand.

As he regarded the multiple Mining Collective members in the building, he nodded at the Weequay [[bartender]], who slowly took cover. Vanth then [[Liberation of Mos Pelgo|opened fire]] on the Collective, who failed to return fire as Vanth's armor protected him. Vanth watched as the remaining members fled for their lives in a transport, but Vanth fired a [[missile]] from his [[Z-6 jetpack|jetpack]] to blow up the transport. Following the event, Vanth began to watch over Mos Pelgo and protect the citizens.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\nBy the [[Standard year|year]] [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"5 ABY\">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> Vanth was the de-facto [[mayor]] of Mos Pelgo, since renamed Freetown, where residents took a stand against the Red Key Raiders. The Red Key attempted to smuggle an infant [[Borgo|Hutt]] into the palace dias at Freetown, but were stopped by Vanth, who acquired the young Hutt. One [[Standard day|day]], [[Malakili]], the former [[beastmaster]] of the late Jabba the Hutt, was robbed by two Red Key thugs on his way to Freetown. Vanth, though, arrived with his [[Twi'lek]] companion [[Issa-Or]] and fired on the [[gangster]]s, quickly killing them.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nVanth and Issa-Or allowed Malakili to get up and claimed they were the law, both of them introducing themselves and Freetown to the beastmaster. Vanth recognized Malakili, but the beastmaster claimed that he was no one and was still mourning the death of his [[rancor]] [[Pateesa]]. Learning of Malakili's trade, the sheriff invited the beastmaster to live in Freetown as an animal trainer for the young Hutt and some resident [[ronto]]s. Malakili took the offer, and Vanth and Issa-Or left for Freetown with the beastmaster.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n===The Red Key occupation===\n{{Quote|The Tuskens consider this place sacred.

The Tuskens regarded Freetown as a sacred place and respected the fact that they had a Hutt, which was since named Borgo. Movellan, however, led an [[Skirmish in Freetown|attack]] on Freetown. Vanth and the residents were overpowered by the Red Key criminals, some being killed in the fighting. Upon the occupation, Movellan had two raiders, the [[Gran]] [[Yimug]] and the [[Rodian]] [[Gweeska]], bring the cuffed sheriff before him. As Vanth was brought forward, he was thrown to the ground by the Yimug and Gweeska kicked him, the other Red Key Raiders cheering around them.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nMovellan mocked Vanth's Mandalorian armor and ordered Yimug and Gweeska to remove the sheriff's [[helmet]]. Lorgan then acknowledged Vanth for being a hindrance to the Red Key, Vanth bragging that it had brought the crime boss to Freetown, and inquired on the Vanth's intentions. After the sheriff expressed his desire for freedom, Lorgan discovered Vanth's slave mark. When Vanth asked what Movellan wanted on Tatooine, the Weequay revealed that he wished to enslave the town's population, exploit Tatooine for its [[dilarium oil]] and silicax oxalate, and sell Borgo to the Hutts.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nMovellan ordered two more raiders, the [[Ithorian]] [[Vommb]] and the brute woman [[Trayness]], to bring forth the young Hutt and Malakili. After Lorgan taunted Vanth a final time, the sheriff returned his own remark and signaled to Malakili, who gave an order to Borgo. As the the crime boss had Trayness club the beastmaster, the Hutt gave out a shriek. This alerted Tusken Raider reinforcements to Freetown, which attacked the Red Key Raiders. As fighting broke out in the town between the raiders and the Tuskens, Vanth freed himself from his cuffs with the help of Malakili and attacked Movellan, disarming the crime boss and bringing him to the ground.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nAfter Vanth told Movellan of his deal with the Tuskens, the Weequay tried to intimidate Vanth by threatening to bring his masters to wipe out the town. Undaunted by Movellan's threats, the sheriff told Lorgan that the crime boss did not know who Vanth really was. Despite knowing that he had incurred the wrath of Red Key, the sheriff stated that he was ready to die in the service of protecting Freetown and keeping criminal elements away from Tatooine. As a parting insult to the defeated crime boss, Vanth proceeded to carve a message onto Movellan's face.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n===Meeting a Mandalorian===\n{{Quote|I've never met a real Mandalorian.

Therefore, the events of \"[[Chapter 9: The Marshal]],\" including the appearance of Cobb Vanth, must have taken place around [[9 ABY]].</ref> the Mandalorian [[bounty]] [[Hunting|hunter]] [[Din Djarin]] arrived in the town searching for another Mandalorian. After learning of the man known as \"The Marshal,\" Djarin met Vanth in the local cantina. Vanth ordered two snorts of [[spotchka]] before telling Djarin that he had never met a real Mandalorian. He elaborated by saying that he knew the stories of the Mandalorians and how they were renowned for their killing ways. Vanth said that he figured only one of them was walking out of the bar, but when he saw [[Grogu]], he said that maybe he had misjudged the Mandalorian. When Djarin demanded Vanth give up his armor, Vanth refused and stood up, preparing for a standoff.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\nHowever, a nearby [[krayt dragon]] caused an earthquake that shook the entire town and ate another one of their [[bantha]]s. Vanth explained to Djarin that the creature had been terrorizing the area since before Mos Pelgo was established. Vanth had been protecting the town from sand people and bandits, but the dragon was too much for him alone. He offered his armor to Djarin in exchange for help in [[Mission to Tatooine (Din Djarin)|taking down]] the beast, saying later he was more fond of the town than his armor. Vanth and Djarin began to ride to the krayt dragon's lair on [[speeder bike]]s. On the way there, Vanth told Djarin the story of how his city had been turned into a [[slavery]] camp the very same night they heard news of the [[Battle of Endor|destruction]] of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], how he acquired his Mandalorian armor from Jawas, and how he took back the town with his newfound weapons.\n\n[[File:VanthTuskenArgue-TMCh9.png|thumb|right|250px|Cobb Vanth argues with a Tusken Raider]]\nAs they rode, they heard a noise of a creature. Both of them immediately stopped their bikes and pulled out their weapons. Grogu hid in his bag. While Vanth watched nervously as the creatures came out from behind the rocks, Djarin began to communicate with them. A group of Tusken Raiders came out as well, and Djarin explained that they too were trying to kill the dragon. The pair made camp for the night with the Tuskens. Whilst sitting at a campfire, Vanth accidentally offended the Tuskens by not drinking a [[black melon]]. Vanth and the sand people began to argue, with Vanth claiming that he only killed their people in self-defense. Djarin then activated his [[flamethrower]] and told the both of them to settle down and focus on how they would kill the dragon.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n===Observing the krayt dragon===\n{{Quote|They might be open to some fresh ideas.|Din Djarin to Cobb Vanth after the unsuccessful attempt|Chapter 9: The Marshal}}\nVanth, Djarin, and the sand people then rode by bantha to the [[abandoned sarlacc pit]] where the krayt dragon lived. Djarin translated for the Tuskens, explaining that they had studied its digestive cycle for generations, and knew how to feed it in order to make it sleep. The Tusken at the entrance of the [[cave]] tied down the bantha and began to yell in an effort to awaken the dragon. As Vanth watched on apprehensively, the Tusken tried to run away, but tripped and was consumed by the dragon, leaving the bantha unharmed. Grogu looked away, frightened, and Djarin suggested that they might be open to new ideas.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n===Combining forces===\n{{Quote|That's more like it&hellip; Where are they getting the reinforcements?''\"<br />\"''I volunteered your village.|Cobb Vanth and Din Djarin|Chapter 9: The Marshal}}\nThe cohort regrouped, and the sand people arranged a diorama of bones and pebbles, which represented the krayt dragon and its combatentes, respectively. Vanth insisted that it was not to scale, and that the krayt was too big, but Djarin assured him that it was, and that Vanth was unaware of the sheer size of the dragon. After a signal from Djarin, a Tusken Raider sprinkled in a few more pebbles. Vanth asked where the reinforcements would be coming from, and to Vanth's shock, Djarin explained that he had volunteered the people of Mos Pelgo.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n[[File:CobbAndDjarinMeeting.png|thumb|left|270px|Vanth and Djarin formed an alliance between Mos Pelgo and the Tusken Raiders.]]\nVanth and Djarin took their speeders back to Mos Pelgo. The people of Mos Pelgo gathered in the cantina. Vanth explained the problem of him having the Mandalorian armor, and that Djarin felt it was his right to take it. He also laid that Djarin was willing to help slay the krayt dragon, which had been terrorizing the town, in exchange for the armor. The people accepted this, but Vanth then revealed to them that the sand people were willing to help with the crusade. This set them off, proclaiming that they were monsters. Djarin then gave the case for the Tuskens, saying that although they were indeed raiders, they knew more about the krayt than anyone there, and would keep their word. If the carcass of the dragon was left to them, they promised to stand by Mos Pelgo in battle, and never to attack them again, unless Mos Pelgo were to break the peace. This was begrudgingly accepted.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\nAs they prepared supplies and weapons, the sand people arrived on their banthas. The people of Mos Pelgo began to load the supplies onto the banthas. One of the Tuskens dropped an explosive, which caused a [[Unidentified Mos Pelgo villager|villager]] to retaliate. He began to yell at the Tusken, who started to yell back at him, until Vanth stepped in and broke up the fight, explaining that it was an accident. The fighting stopped, but the tension remained.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n===Dragon slaying===\n{{Quote|What are you gonna do?''\"\"<br />\"''I don't know, but wish me luck!|Cobb Vanth and Din Djarin|Chapter 9: The Marshal}}\n[[File:VanthDjarinScope-TMCh9.png|thumb|right|250px|Djarin and Vanth watch as the krayt dragon emerges from the cave.]]\nThe group walked to the krayt dragon's cave. One Tusken walked up to its entrance and felt the ground near it. Djarin translated that the dragon was sleeping, and one could hear its breathing. A trench near the cave was dug, and the explosives were buried in it. The sand people also prepared a number of ballistae. A villager named [[Jo]] then handed the detonator to Vanth, who told her to stay safe. A trio of Tuskens walked up to the cave and began to yell to wake up the dragon. They ran away as soon as they heard it arise. Vanth watched as the dragon slowly crawled out. The Tuskens fired their arrows, but the dragon started to move back inside the cave. Vanth was about to detonate the explosives, but Djarin cautioned that they would only have one shot, and that they would have to get it out.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\nThe villagers and sand people began to fire arrows and blaster fire at the krayt, provoking it to come out further. The krayt dragon then fired a stream of its spit on its attackers, killing several of them. It was then that Vanth detonated the explosives at Djarin's instruction. The group cautiously walked towards the explosion, although Vanth and Djarin did not think it to be dead. The dragon then suddenly burst through the hill above its cave and fired another stream of spit. Vanth remarked that they were being picked off like [[womp rat]]s, put on his helmet, and flew with Djarin via his jet pack toward the dragon. The pair began to fire at it with their blaster rifles. They both took off when the krayt took notice of them.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n[[File:VanthDjarinFiring-TMCh9.png|thumb|left|250px|Djarin and Vanth firing at the krayt dragon.]]\nIt then disappeared again, and came out of the ground from behind them, chasing after the Tuskens and Mos Pelgo residents. Djarin told Vanth to get its attention, so Vanth bent over and fired a missile from his armor at it. He handed the detonator to Djarin, who subsequently hit Vanth's jet pack, causing it to malfunction and shoot straight into the air. Djarin then armed a batch of explosives that were attached to a bantha, and had the dragon swallow the both of then. The dragon then went back underground. Vanth landed awkwardly nearby. The group, including Vanth and Grogu, looked around for the krayt, wondering if Djarin would be alright. It then came back above ground, and Djarin flew out, having used his [[Amban phase-pulse blaster]] to give the dragon an electric shock. He then detonated the bantha, which remained in the krayt's [[stomach]], killing the dragon.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\nBoth parties of the group began to celebrate together, as Vanth watched. The sand people hacked away at the meat, and eventually found the [[krayt dragon pearl]] they were looking for. Djarin apologized for not explaining his plan, but Vanth told him not to worry about it, handing over the Mandalorian armor he had promised. Vanth remarked that he hoped their paths would cross again, and that he was not the one who broke the armor. Djarin and Grogu then rode off in their speeder, and were being watched by the original owner of Vanth's armor, [[Boba Fett]].<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" /> Fett would continue to track down Djarin and, he eventually reclaimed his armor.<ref name=\"Chapter 14\">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 14: The Tragedy}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|What you think I stole, I say I earned.

After Charu discovered a set of Mandalorian battle armor, Vanth took interest in obtaining it to wear as a lawman and remained persistent when Adwin defiantly claimed the armor, shooting a glancing shot at the representative when he threatened to draw his own blaster.
