Speed appreciated, must run now.|Radanthus Mandelatara|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Radanthus Mandelatara''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Author/Legends|playwright]] who lived on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Sometime following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], he stayed at the [[Moenia hotel|hotel]] in [[Moenia/Legends|Moenia]], a [[City/Legends|city]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. While overseeing the production of a performance titled ''[[Hearts of Empire]]'' at [[Theed/Legends|Theed's]] [[Templexus of the Dramatic Arts]], Mandelatara commissioned a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to acquire an [[Species/Legends|animal]] pelt for use as a theatrical prop. His [[Radanthus Mandelatara's touring company|touring company]] ran into another problem when their female lead, named [[Mairlenn]], lost her pet [[Voorpak/Legends|voorpak]] named [[Dotti]] to a pack of ravenous beasts. Hoping to placate the irritated [[Actor/Legends|actress]], Radanthus yet again commissioned a spacer, this time to [[Hunting/Legends|hunt]] down and [[Death/Legends|kill]] the vicious beasts as a means of vengeance.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|The touring company for my current production&mdash;''Hearts of Empire'', now at Theed's Templexus of the Dramatic Arts, seats still available&mdash;has run into a teensy problem. Our female lead, Mairlenn, had a pet voorpak, called Dotti or something. She took the little thing with her on a visit to the countryside, let it roam, and, well, those voorpaks really are a major source of protein in the ecosystem, aren't they? Mairlenn is in quite a snit. She saw the creatures that ate Dotti, and she insists that I find someone to locate and punish those beasts, I mean really punish them. Is that okay?|Radanthus Mandelatara|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Author/Legends|playwright]], Randanthus Mandalatara lived at the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the major [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] conflict known as the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], during which the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] won a decisive victory against the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] at the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]<ref name=\"AED\" /> in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]].<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> At some point following the battle, Mandelatara elected to stay at the [[Moenia hotel|hotel]] in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Moenia/Legends|Moenia]], an [[Artist/Legends|artists']] retreat on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. During his time on Naboo, Mandelatara and his [[Radanthus Mandelatara's touring company|touring company]] began production on an upcoming theatrical production titled ''[[Hearts of Empire]]'', which was to be played at [[Theed/Legends|Theed's]] [[Templexus of the Dramatic Arts]]. Lacking a sufficient prop budget, but demanding palpable authenticity for his scenes, Mandelatara required a fierce predator's pelt to use in his production. To that end, he submitted a jobs posting on [[mission terminal]]s looking for able-bodied [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]] to acquire one such pelt in exchange for [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nAt least one such spacer was up to the task, and successfully [[Hunting/Legends|hunted]] down creatures in order to secure a pelt for Mandelatara's production. Meanwhile, Mandelatara's touring company encountered a problem when their female lead named [[Mairlenn]] lost her pet [[Voorpak/Legends|voorpak]] called [[Dotti]] to a pack of beasts during a visit to the Naboo countryside. After having witnessed the grizzly ordeal herself, Mairlenn insisted that Mandelatara find someone to \"punish\" the pack of beasts. Seeing that the woman was quite upset, Mandelatara relented and posted another job's posting, this time for individuals solely on Naboo, to hunt down the beasts and [[Death/Legends|kill]] them. At least one spacer was up to the task of meeting Mairlenn's demands, and the creatures responsible for consuming her pet voorpak were duly defeated. During his stay at the Moenia [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]], Mandelatara also encountered a spacer who wished to speak to him. However, Mandelatara did not want to speak to the spacer, because he was distracted and was trying to remember something he had forgotten.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I'm sorry, I'm a bit distracted. I'm trying to remember something&hellip;|Radanthus Mandelatara|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nMandelatara had fair skin, [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and a beard, and amber-colored [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. As a playwright, he demanded authenticity in his performances, going so far as to acquire a freshly hunted animal pelt for use as a theatrical prop. He was also prone to forgetting things, as evidenced by his encounter with the spacer in Moenia.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nAt the time of his stay in Moenia, Mandelatara wore a vest and padded [[Jacket/Legends|jacket]]. The jacket was a type of [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]] worn by both Imperial [[Surface Marshal]]s and [[Recruitment Agent|Alliance recruitment agents]],<ref name=\"AED\" /> and was similar to the [[Alliance Cold Weather Padded Vest|vest]] and [[Alliance Cold Weather tunic|tunic]] worn by [[Rebel trooper/Legends|Rebel troopers]] stationed at [[Echo Base/Legends|Echo Base]] on the planet [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]].<ref name=\"ESB\">[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]</ref> However, his jacket differed from those worn by the Hoth Rebels, in that the padded collar was an integral component of his under-jacket<ref name=\"AED\" /> rather than the vest.<ref name=\"ESB\" /> Furthermore, Mandelatara's jacket was colored differently than those worn by Imperial and Rebel forces. His consisted of a brown-colored vest, with a beige-colored under-jacket. The [[Belt/Legends|belt]] he wore around his vested jacket was a dark shade of brown, with a silver-colored buckle. In addition to the vested jacket, Mandelatara also wore brown pocketed work pants and brown standard [[Boot/Legends|boots]].<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nRadanthus Mandelatara was a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"AED\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> In the game, Mandelatara served no particular purpose, merely telling players who attempted to converse with him that he was distracted and trying to remember something.<ref name=\"AED\" /> Radanthus Mandelatara is listed in a couple reference guides for [[W:c:swg:Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies'']], including ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]'' (2003), and ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' ([[2004]]). In both of these reference guides, he is listed as a townsperson found on [[W:c:swg:Naboo|Naboo]].<ref name=\"Prima\" /><ref name=\"JTL\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> Despite the NPC serving no purpose, Radanthus Mandelatara was featured in the descriptions for a couple [[W:c:swg:Mission Terminal|mission terminal]] missions, completion of which would award the player with [[W:c:swg:Imperial credit|credits]]. One of these missions was a destroy mission titled ''Theatrical Prop Needed''. The other, available only from mission terminals on Naboo, was a destroy mission titled ''Punishment of Naboo Predator Needed''. The latter mission was available in two varying levels of difficulty, including easy and medium, but the content was identical.<ref name=\"AED\" />\n\n===Cut content===\n{{Quote|I can't use that thing, it's all bloody! And the aroma is a bit, shall we say, intense for the theater. Well, I suppose I did ask. Here's your fee, must run. (Now what am I to do with this carcass? Hmm, inspiration is striking&hellip;)|Cut dialogue from Radanthus Mandelatara|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nIn the game's directory tree files and source data, Mandelatara is placed among the many NPCs who gave players simple kill, delivery, and escort [[W:c:swg:Quest|quests]]. The files contain additional dialogue for the two aforementioned missions which are not definitively known to have appeared on the live [[W:c:swg:Server|servers]]. For the mission titled ''Theatrical Prop Needed'', the game files include dialogue where Mandelatara expresses dismay regarding the pelt that was acquired for him. He remarks that the pelt was [[Blood/Legends|bloodied]] and gave off an unpleasant aroma, and that he would be unwilling to use such a thing in a live performance. However, in the dialogue, he also muses to himself that the animal remains were providing him with a source of inspiration. Likewise, the mission titled ''Punishment of Naboo Predator Needed'' contains additional cut dialogue, in which Mandelatara expresses relief after the mission is accomplished. He also states that due to a budget line item for Mairlenn's demands, he would have no problem processing payment for completion of the job.<ref name=\"TRE\">{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} directory tree files and source data</ref>\n\nThe game data also include information on a series of three other quests which were intended to be provided by the NPC itself, the first of which would have required the killing of at least one [[Peko-peko/Legends|peko-peko]], and the other two requiring the retrieval of specific items from two separate NPCs. As no conversational text string files are associated with these three quests, the exact context of this cut content remains unclear. However, each quest would have awarded the player 100, 150, and 200 credits respectively.<ref name=\"TRE\" />\n{{Cutstart}}\nWhile in Moenia, Mandelatara commissioned a spacer to hunt down a peko-peko. The [[Bird/Legends|bird]] was accompanied by yet another peko-peko, both of which were killed. After having accomplished this, Mandelatara tasked the spacer with meeting a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] [[Courier/Legends|messenger]] named [[Hiddi]]. While en route to meet Hiddi, the spacer was ambushed by yet another couple peko-pekos, both of which were killed. Hiddi then gave the spacer a sealed container of freshly plucked pinfeathers from two fine peko-pekos to give back to Mandelatara. As one final task, Mandelatara hired the spacer to obtain a finely crafted electrical device from a [[Scavenger/Legends|scavenger]] known as [[Thogo|Thogo the Annihilator]]. Despite being attacked by an aggressive female [[tusk-cat]] while on the way to meet Thogo, the spacer was successful in slaying the [[Feline/Legends|feline]], and delivering Thogo's electrical device back to the playwright. For accomplishing these tasks, Mandelatara provided payment for a job well done.<ref name=\"TRE\" />\n{{Cutend}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mandelatara, Radanthus}}\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
