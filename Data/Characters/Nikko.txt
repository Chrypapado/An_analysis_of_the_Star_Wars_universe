Are you interested in a friendly game of pazaak? The deck is warm, the drink is plentiful, and the company amiable. Can I tempt you?|Nikko's greeting to Meetra Surik, upon their first meeting|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Nikko''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] player who lived in [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], during the [[Onderon Civil War]] in [[3951 BBY]]. He spent most of his [[Time/Legends|time]] playing pazaak in the [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|Iziz Cantina]]. When [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], visited the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] to investigate the [[Death/Legends|murder]] of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sullio]] of the [[Onderonian military]] in hopes of clearing [[Doctor/Legends|Dr.]] [[Dhagon Ghent]] of the crime, Nikko was one of the people to whom she spoke. After a thorough investigation, Nikko and Surik were able to convince the Onderon authorities of Ghent's innocence, setting the doctor free.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|That night Sullio was in great form. Dhagon and I were laughing about some of the choicer ones later. 'Yellow-toothed dung dweller,' heh heh. We bought her a couple of drinks afterwards.|Nikko, remarking on Ghent's and Sullio's \"insult wars\"|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nNikko was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]], the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], during the [[Onderon Civil War]]<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> in [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> Most of his [[Time/Legends|time]] was spent in the [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|Iziz Cantina]], [[Alcohol/Legends|drinking]] and playing [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] with his friends and fellow patrons. When a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] by the name of [[Meetra Surik]] visited the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in search for clues to clear [[Doctor/Legends|Dr.]] [[Dhagon Ghent]] of the [[Death/Legends|murder]] of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Sullio]] of the [[Onderonian military]], she spoke with Nikko, a friend of both Ghent and Sullio, about the incident. He did not believe that Ghent would hurt Sullio, and stated that both he and the doctor respected her and admired her sharp wit.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nFollowing further investigation, Surik learned that on the night of the murder, Ghent and Sullio had gotten into an apparently heated argument. When asked about this, Nikko explained that after too much [[Juma Juice|juma juice]], the two often engaged in an exchange of creative insults, but he insisted that it was all in good fun. Nikko also recounted that just after the murder, he had witnessed Ghent coming from his office across the courtyard outside of the cantina. Upon inspection of the crime scene, Surik was able to obtain a recording of the murder from the [[memory core]] of [[S-0D3-GE3]], a [[Service droid/Legends|service droid]] from the cantina that had been found near Sullio's body, and learned that the kill shot had come from the opposite direction of Ghent's office. After Nikko watched the recording, he and Surik took it to the authorities holding Ghent, who agreed that he could not have committed the crime and set the doctor free.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Know him? He's probably my best friend on this planet. Honestly, he's not a very good doctor. But he is a great drinking companion.|Nikko's opinion of Dr. Dhagon Ghent|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nNikko was a friendly person, always eager to have a drink and play a game of pazaak with any willing patron of the cantina. Nikko regarded Dhagon Ghent as his best friend on Onderon, though he admittedly thought that he was not a very good doctor. On the other hand, he believed that Ghent was a great drinking companion. Nikko had [[Color/Legends|brown]]-hair, hazel [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and fair skin.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNikko appears in the [[2004]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' as a non-player character with whom the player, cast as the Jedi Exile, must interact to progress through the Onderon portion of the game.
