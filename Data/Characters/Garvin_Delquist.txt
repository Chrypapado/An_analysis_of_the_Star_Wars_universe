While he was there, he began to secretly fall in love with [[Misha Quor-Din]], a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] at the [[Almas Academy]]. In circa [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], something began killing the kaluthin and Delquist traveled to the [[Almas Sith fortress]] to search for any clues about why this was happening. However, he instead found a [[Sith amulet]], which placed him under the influence of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]].\n\nBased in the fortress, Delquist gathered a group of [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] followers from among the [[Believers]], a [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]] that operated on Almas. He had them capture Misha Quor-Din and bring her back to the fortress. However, she did not reciprocate the feelings he had for her, pushing him further under the influence of the dark side.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Kaluthin Are Always Greener]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[A Dark Fortress]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delquist, Garvin}}\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Dark Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
