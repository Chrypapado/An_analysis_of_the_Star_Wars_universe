He believed that the [[Metatheran Cartel]] was involved in illegal operations, and discovered something which he believed would sink the Cartel. Before he could compile proof and share it with anybody, he was kidnapped by a group of [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] dressed in the security uniforms of House Hirskaala. The pirates were in league with [[Velin Wir]] of the Cartel, and they took Darin to a landing platform they were using hidden in the jungle. Darin managed to escape, and disappeared into the jungle heading generally back towards [[Gadrin]], but was never seen from again.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Cularin Presence]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
