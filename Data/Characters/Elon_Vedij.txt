In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] he was posted to the same ship as his brother, who was serving as [[Executive officer/Legends|executive officer]] on board the ''[[Far Orbit]]''. Dhas suspected this was to make the removal of the Vedij family, whose loyalty to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] was apparently suspect, easier.\n\nIn any case, Elon died in combat with the [[Tarnished Blades|Silent Blades]] [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] after [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Vocis Kenit]] ordered all of his [[TIE/LN starfighter]]s to attack them in their asteroid lair.
