In addition to being a member of the Order, Kolar was a [[Zabrak]] [[Jedi Master]], a notable [[Lightsaber duel|duelist]], and sat on the [[Jedi High Council]]. [[Gender|He]] and [[Saesee Tiin]] were [[Death|killed]] by [[Darth Sidious]] in a [[lightsaber]] [[Duel in Palpatine's office|duel]] alongside two other [[Jedi]]: [[Kit Fisto]] and [[Mace Windu]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nAgen Kolar was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Coruscant]] prior to the [[Separatist Crisis]]. [[Gender|He]] was found to be [[Force-sensitive]] and brought to the [[Jedi Temple]] to be trained as a [[Jedi]]. He eventually rose up to the rank of [[Jedi Master]].<ref name=\"ECUC\" /> He soon gained a [[Padawan]] named [[Tan Yuster]].<ref name=\"Lightsabers\" />\n\n===Battle of Geonosis===\n[[File:Kolar-Geonosis.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Kolar during the first Battle of Geonosis]]\nKolar participated in the [[First Battle of Geonosis]], the conflict that sparked the [[Clone Wars]] between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]]. As a participant, [[Gender|he]] was a member of the [[Jedi assault team]] assembled by fellow [[Jedi High Council]] member [[Mace Windu]] to rescue [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] from being [[Death|executed]] by the Separatists.<ref name=\"Attack of the Clones\" /> During the battle, Kolar's [[Padawan]] [[Tan Yuster]] was overwhelmed by [[B2-series super battle droid]]s and [[Death|killed]]. The Jedi Master recovered the blue [[kyber crystal]] from his fallen apprentice's [[lightsaber]] and later added it to [[Agen Kolar's lightsaber|his own]] as a homage.<ref name=\"Lightsabers\" />\n\n===Yoda's vision===\nIn the last [[Standard year|year]] of the Clone Wars, [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] experienced a [[Force vision|vision]] of Kolar's death at the hands of [[Darth Sidious]] whilst on the [[planet]] [[Dagobah]] to learn the secrets of immortality.<ref name=\"Voices\">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>\n\n===Discussions on the Jedi Council===\nIn [[19 BBY]],{{Fact}} Kolar replaced fellow Zabrak [[Eeth Koth]] on the Jedi High Council after Koth was forced to step down.<ref name=\"Insider 199\">{{InsiderCite|199|A Seat on the Council}}</ref> He took part in many important discussions such as when [[Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine requested that Skywalker be appointed to the Council. He was also present when Palpatine reported that [[General]] [[Grievous]] was hiding on [[Utapau]] and suggested that they dispatch [[Jedi Knight]] Anakin Skywalker. The Council instead [[Battle of Utapau|dispatched]] Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref name=\"Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n===Death===\n[[File:TheDeathofAgenKolar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kolar is struck down by Darth Sidious.]]\nDuring the last [[Standard day|days]] of the war, Kolar was part of another team assembled by Windu, this [[time]] to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest]] Palpatine&mdash;who was secretly [[Darth]] Sidious, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]]. Of the four Jedi Masters sent to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest]] the Dark [[Lord]], Kolar and [[Saesee Tiin]] were near effortlessly killed. The other two Masters, [[Kit Fisto]] and Windu, also perished and Sidious [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]] and [[Order 66|destroyed]] the [[Jedi Order]].<ref name=\"Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAgen Kolar was known to strike first and ask questions later. He was also considered a valuable member of the Jedi Council. Mace Windu had a high opinion of Kolar's combat skills, which led him to recruit the Zabrak in the attempt to arrest Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.<ref name=\"ECUC\" /> Sidious, however, easily killed Kolar.<ref name=\"Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:Agem_Kolar_DB.png|thumb|right|180px|Jedi Master Agen Kolar]]\nHe was a master swordsman of the Jedi Order and his lightsaber skills were widely celebrated and renowned.<ref name=\"ECUC\" /> Despite Kolar's reputation, Darth Sidious was able to slay the [[Zabrak]] Jedi with a single blow.<ref name=\"Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nKolar built his lightsaber in such a way that it used dual [[Kyber crystal|crystals]], which allowed the [[color]] of the lightsaber blade to ignite with either his green blade or his deceased student Yuster's blue blade.<ref name=\"ECUC\" /> The latter's weapon was used during Kolar's assistance in helping to arrest [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], who killed him.<ref name=\"Revenge of the Sith\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAgen Kolar was first created by ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]], who originally intended for Kolar to be the character [[Eeth Koth]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]. However, there are several differences between the characters' physical characteristics that Koth had that Kolar lacked. Lucasfilm soon decided to create a new character: Agen Kolar. Kolar was created as a new character for [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']].{{Fact}} He went on to appear in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']],<ref name=\"Revenge of the Sith\" /> and he appeared in a vision in \"[[Voices]],\" an episode of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.<ref name=\"Voices\" /> However, it is the model of Eeth Koth that is used during the brief scene.{{Fact}}\n\n[[Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]] mistakenly depicts Kolar as having lines.<ref name=\"Prequel Graphic\">''[[Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes|''Star Wars:'' ''Galaxy of Heroes'']]\n*''[[5-Minute Star Wars Stories Strike Back]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|Voices}} {{Vision|Yoda}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]\n*[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] {{Imo}}\n*[[Tarkin (audiobook)|''Tarkin'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars Rebels (webcomic)|''Star Wars Rebels'' webcomic]]  {{C|Appears through imagination}}\n*{{Galaxy of Adventures|Luke vs. Emperor Palpatine - Rise to Evil}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll_box|\n*{{SWE|groups|jediorder|Jedi Order}} {{Po}}\n*{{SWCT|Agen Kolar - Jedi Master - Base Series 1|Agen Kolar - Jedi Master - ''Base Series 1''}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|10|Highlights of the Saga|Birth of an Empire}} {{Imo}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|15|Highlights of the Saga|Palpatine Unmasked}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|18|Databank A-Z|First Order&ndash;Fyrnocks}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Super Graphic: A Visual Guide to a Galaxy Far, Far Away]]''\n*''[[Forces of Destiny: Tales of Hope & Courage]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|28|Databank A-Z|Queen Jamillia&ndash;Jedi Temples}} {{Po}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|33|Databank A-Z|Admiral Kilian&ndash;Kowakian}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|40|Weapons & Uniforms|The Jedi Knights}} {{Po}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|44|Databank A-Z|Zeb Orrelios&ndash;Pau City}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Lightsabers: A Guide to Weapons of the Force]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|55|Databank A-Z|Saesee Tiin&ndash;Toydaria}} {{Imo}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|70|Databank A-Z|Wicket Warrick&ndash;Weequay}} {{Po}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|72|Databank A-Z|Mace Windu}}\n*''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Jedi]]'' {{Imo}}\n*{{BuildXWingCite|27|Starfighter Aces|Saesee Tiin &ndash; Iktochi Jedi Ace}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|79|Databank A-Z|Zabrak&ndash;Zillo Beast}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|199|A Seat on the Council}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga: The Official Collector's Edition]]'' {{Po}}\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Anakin Skywalker (Star Wars Encyclopedia)|Anakin Skywalker}} {{Po}}\n*{{Databank|agen-kolar|Agen Kolar|archivedate=20170707043140}}\n*{{Databank|coruscant|Coruscant|archivedate=20200510123203}} {{Po}}\n*{{Databank|emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious|Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious|archivedate=20200607022052}} {{Imo}}\n*{{Databank|geonosis|Geonosis|archivedate=20170905054006}} {{Po}}\n*{{Databank|jedi-order|Jedi Order|archivedate=20190329084022}}\n*{{Databank|mace-windu|Mace Windu|archivedate=20200225083838}} {{Po}}}}\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=Member of the [[Jedi High Council]]\n|years=[[19 BBY]]{{Fact}}\n|before=[[Eeth Koth]]<ref name=\"Insider 199\" />\n|before-years=&ndash;[[19 BBY]]{{Fact}}\n|after=None\n}}\n{{End_box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{JediCouncil19}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Agen Kolar\n|de=Agen Kolar#kanon\n|el=\u0388\u03b9\u03c4\u03b6\u03b5\u03bd \u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\n|es=Agen Kolar\n|fi=Agen Kolar\n|fr=Agen Kolar\n|hu=Agen Kolar\n|it=Agen Kolar\n|ja=\u30a8\u30fc\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\n|ka=\u10d0\u10d2\u10d4\u10dc \u10d9\u10dd\u10da\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\n|ko=\uc5d0\uc774\uc820 \ucf5c\ub7ec\n|nl=Agen Kolar\n|pl=Agen Kolar\n|pt=Legends:Agen Kolar\n|ru=\u0410\u0433\u0435\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0440/\u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\n|sk=Agen Kolar\n|sv=Agen Kolar\n|tr=Agen Kolar\n|uk=\u0410\u0491\u0435\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kolar, Agen}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Jedi High Council members]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge victims]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Zabrak]]"}}}]}}}}
