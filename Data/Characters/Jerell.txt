He was the father of two daughters; one of them, [[Bettle]], was a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], while [[Bettle's sister|the other]] was dead by the end of the New Republic capture of Ralltiir, a death he blamed on Ralltiir's Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]], [[Dennix Graeber]].\n\n==Biography==\nJerell managed to convince Bettle to assist in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]], joking that it paid her better than her smuggling did. His daughter began by running guns to Ralltiir with her partner [[Jaxa]]; eventually, he got Bettle caught up in the Rebellion itself.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] began making pushes into the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]], though no Core World had actually fallen to the New Republic. Jerell and Bettle were present in an underground communications center on Ralltiir, monitoring communications from the New Republic strike team led by [[Spike (individual)|Spike]], when Governor Graeber initiated communication with the resistance leader, taunting him. In the midst of the communication, Spike's team destroyed the planet's power generators at the same time that a task force of six [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]s entered the system, ensuring that Ralltiir would be the first Core World to fall to the New Republic. Jerell took great satisfaction in taunting Graeber, noting that he had the fortune to be the first Imperial governor to welcome the New Republic to Core World soil.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Heroes & Rogues]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic Defense Force officers]]\n[[Category:Ralltiiri]]"}}}]}}}}
