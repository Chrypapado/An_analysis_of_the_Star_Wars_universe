Zerik had a sister, although she was one of the many Bothans who were [[Death/Legends|killed]] while obtained information about the [[Death Star II/Legends|second Death Star]].\n\n==Personality==\nZerik was pragmatic by Bothan standards and recognized the evils of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and its leader, [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. He also sought no wealth for his services and performed most of his work for the Alliance for free. Following the death of his sister, he developed an extreme hatred for the Empire and became more concerned with making the Empire pay for causing his sister's death than he was with overthrowing it.\n\nZerik preferred to remain hidden until he felt that the time was right to strike, so he would lull targets into a false sense of security, by feigning a harmless demeanor. He would then unleashed his combat skills against them and was prepared to fight like a cornered animal, because he had no honor and was prepared to do anything to achieve victory.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy of Intrigue]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zerik\n}}\n\n[[Category:Agents of the Rebel Alliance]]\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nyriaan residents]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
