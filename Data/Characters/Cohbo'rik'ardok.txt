At the age of five, the Chiss was determined to be [[Force-sensitive|suitable]] to become a [[Ozyly-esehembo|sky-walker]], a [[navigator]] for the [[Chiss Ascendancy]]. She was taken from her [[parent]]s, with her brother assuming that she had [[Death|died]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAfter his [[Merit adoptive|adoption]] into the [[Mitth family]] and reaching [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] [[officer]] rank in the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet]], Thrawn was informed of the sky-walkers and their nature for the first time, realizing what had happened to his sister. He wished that he could see his sister again, but believed that, similar to most sky-walkers, she had sought to disappear into obscurity after her service. Thrawn later told the story of his sister to the former sky-walker [[Mitth'ali'astov]], who suggested that he consult official records&mdash;an idea that Thrawn denied, following the Ascendancy's practice of honoring former sky-walkers' wishes.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCohbo'riki'ardok was first mentioned, albeit not by name, in the [[2020]] novel ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'', written by [[Timothy Zahn]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> She made her first full appearance in the [[2021]] novel ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]'', also written by Zahn.<ref name=\"Lesser Evil\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'' {{1stm|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]'' {{1st|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil'' audiobook]]}} {{1stID|\"Cohbo'rik'ardok\", \"Borika\", \"Kivu'rik'ardok\", and \"Irizi'rik'ardok\"}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Siostra Mitth'raw'nuruodo\n|ru=\u0421\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0442'\u0440\u0430\u0443'\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0443\u043e\u0434\u043e\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Irizi family]]\n[[Category:Ool residents]]\n[[Category:Ozyly-esehembo]]"}}}]}}}}
