Trace and Martez were orphaned after their parents died during the [[Senate hostage crisis]], forcing them to eke out a living.\n\nThe Martez sisters later befriended a former [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] named [[Ahsoka Tano]]. Tano accompanied them on a botched [[spice]] delivery run between [[Kessel]] and [[Oba Diah]]. The sisters managed to escape the custody of the [[Pyke Syndicate]] with the help of Tano, which helped them gain a better appraisal of the Jedi. Following the establishment of the [[Galactic Empire]], the Martez sisters helped to acquire technology to assist a resistance movement fighting against Imperial rule.\n\n==History==\n===Orphans===\nThe Martez family lived on [[Level 1313]] in the [[Coruscant Underworld]] during the last days of the [[Galactic Republic]], consisting of [[Trace and Rafa Martez's mother|two]] [[Trace and Rafa Martez's father|parents]] and two daughters named [[Trace Martez|Trace]] and [[Rafa Martez]]. During the [[Senate hostage crisis|Senate Hostage Crisis]] in [[21 BBY]], the family was shattered when Trace and Rafa's [[Trace and Rafa Martez's mother|mother]] and [[Trace and Rafa Martez's father|father]] were both inadvertently [[Death|killed]] as a result of the [[Jedi]]'s attempt to recapture the escaped [[Hutt]] [[gangster]] [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure]], leaving the sisters to fend for themselves in the Coruscant underworld. As a result of the incident, Rafa and Trace harbored bitterness towards the [[Jedi Order]], whom they blamed for their parents' deaths.<ref name=\"Dangerous Debt\">{{TCW|Dangerous Debt}}</ref>\n\nFollowing their parents' deaths, Trace found work as a [[mechanic]] and owned a [[Trace Martez's repair shop|repair shop]] in Level 1313. Rafa owned and operated a [[Rafa's Laundry|laundromat]]. The two sisters also owned a [[Nebula-class freighter|''Nebula''-class freighter]] called the ''Silver Angel''. The sisters struggled to make ends meet, with Trace juggling debts while Rafa stole from her customers. They also worked on modified [[binary loadlifter]]s.<ref name=\"Gone with a Trace\" />\n\n===Adventures with Ahsoka Tano===\nTowards the end of the [[Clone Wars]], the Martez sisters came into contact with the former [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], who had left the Order. After crashlanding her bike on Trace's platform, Trace befriended Tano. In return for repairing Tano's [[speeder bike]], Tano helped Trace fend off the alien debt collector [[Pintu Son-El]]. Later, the Martez sisters entered into an arrangement to assemble three modified binary loadlifters for the [[Twi'lek]] [[Lokann]]. However, one of the droids went rogue, forcing the sisters to disable it with Tano's help.<ref name=\"Gone with a Trace\" />\n\nTo pay off their mounting debts, Rafa accepted a job to transport [[spice]] from [[Kessel]] to the [[Pyke Syndicate]]'s [[crime lord]] [[Marg Krim]] on [[Oba Diah]]. The sisters became embroiled in an argument with Tano about the ethics of exporting spice, which Tano regarded as a harmful narcotic. Fearing the loss of her ship, a distraught Trace dumped the spice into [[realspace|space]]. Arriving on Oba Diah, the Martez sisters attempted to swindle [[Majordomo]] [[Fife]] into believing they had delivered the spice. However, Fife was not fooled and the Pykes detained the sisters and Tano.<ref name=\"Deal No Deal\">{{TCW|Deal No Deal}}</ref>\n\nThe Martez sisters and Tano were imprisoned by the Pyke Syndicate. While in captivity, Tano learned about the Martez sisters' background and loss of their parents. Rafa was interrogated and [[torture]]d by her captors for information about the lost spice shipment. When it came to Trace's turn, she escaped her captors and managed to free her sister and Tano. The trio managed to [[Escape from Oba Diah|escape]] the prison into [[Oba Diah city]]. However, they were recaptured following a struggle with Pyke Syndicate forces.<ref name=\"Dangerous Debt\" />\n\nThe trio were later brought before Krim for punishment. Tano managed to free the sisters by claiming they had hidden the spice offworld. Krim sent the Martez sisters to retrieve the spice within one rotation, threatening to execute Tano if they failed. The Martez sisters managed to steal a shipment of spice from a Pyke facility and returned to Krim's palace on Oba Diah. By then, Tano had made a second escape attempt and learnt that the Pyke Syndicate had ties to the former [[Sith apprentice]] [[Maul]]. Returning to Oba Diah, the Martez sisters learned of Tano's Jedi identity. Since Tano had planted [[detonator]]s in the Pyke Syndicate's [[Pyke Palace|stronghold]], the trio were able to escape Oba Diah on their ship.<ref name=\"Together Again\">{{TCW|Together Again}}</ref>\n\nReturning to Coruscant, Tano and the Martez sisters departed on good terms. Though Tano had left the Jedi Order, Rafa believed that she embodied the best characteristics of a Jedi due to her [[Light side of the Force|selflessness]] and moral compass. The Martez sisters were present when a [[Mandalorian]] delegation led by [[Bo-Katan Kryze]] visited Tano, seeking help to end Maul's rule over [[Mandalore]].<ref name=\"Together Again\" />\n\n===Resisting the Empire===\nShortly after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|formation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], the Martez sisters worked to acquire technology to help a resistance movement fight against the tyranny of the Empire. During a [[Mission to a droid decommissioning facility|mission]] on [[Corellia]], the two sisters attempted to steal the head of a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[tactical droid]] but ran into competition from the rogue [[Cloning|clones]] known as the [[Clone Force 99|Bad Batch]] and their young charge [[Omega]], who had been hired by the [[Trandoshan]] [[Cid]] to acquire the droid's head.<ref name=\"Decommissioned\">{{TBB|Decommissioned}}</ref>\n\nDespite their conflicting goals, the two factions worked together to fight and escape several [[police droid]]s. Despite losing the tactical droid's head, the Bad Batch provided the Martez sisters with a [[data rod]] containing information from the droid after learning they were fighting the Empire. The Martez sisters also developed a sisterly friendship with Omega, who looked up to the older women. The sisters later related their encounter with the Bad Batch to [[Rex]].<ref name=\"Decommissioned\" /><ref name=\"Battle Scars\">{{TBB|Battle Scars}}</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{FamilyTree/start|summary=Rafa and Trace Martez were sisters.}}\n{{FamilyTree| Mom |y| Dad |Mom=[[Trace and Rafa Martez's mother|Martez mother]]|Dad=[[Trace and Rafa Martez's father|Martez father]]}}\n{{FamilyTree| | | |!| | | |}}\n{{FamilyTree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{FamilyTree| Rafa| |Trace|Trace=[[Trace Martez]]|Rafa=[[Rafa Martez]]}}\n{{FamilyTree/end}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|Gone with a Trace}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|Deal No Deal}}\n*''[[The Clone Wars: Season 7: Volume 1]]''\n*{{TCW|Dangerous Debt}}\n*{{TCW|Together Again}}\n*{{TBB|Decommissioned}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWCT|Overall Award - Episode 7 - Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Season 7 Episode Series|Overall Award - Episode 7 - ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Season 7 Episode Series''}}\n*{{SWCT|Overall Award - Episode 8 - Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Season 7 Episode Series|Overall Award - Episode 8 - ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Season 7 Episode Series''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|200|Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Final Countdown|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'': The Final Countdown}}\n*{{Databank|rafa|Rafa|archivedate=20200510123201}}\n*{{Databank|trace|Trace|archivedate=20200414070231}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Familia Martez\n|fr=Famille Martez\n|ja=\u30de\u30eb\u30c6\u30b9\u5bb6\n|pl=Martez\n|ru=\u0421\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0432\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Families]]"}}}]}}}}
