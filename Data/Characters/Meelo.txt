After an acquaintance of hers was apprehended by the [[Metatheran Cartel]] and imprisoned in a Cartel building on Cularin, Meelo and several of her associates&mdash;a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], a [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] scrounger, the [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Keth-Keth]] and the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Roorrrwiir]]&mdash;determined to free their captive friend. They attempted to bluff their way into the building, but their plan failed and the Cartel's security threw them out. While Meelo and her team sat in a [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] to consider their next move, two [[Swoop/Legends|swoops]] approached them from behind, and taken by surprise, Roorrrwiir inadvertently crashed the speeder into the Cartel facility. Meelo and the crew bailed out and [[Slicer/Legends|sliced]] into the building's [[Computer/Legends|mainframe]], then freed their friend. However, just as they attempted to leave the building, an [[Office of Peace and Security]] speeder arrived on the scene. Not wanting to be arrested, Meelo's associates threw [[Stun grenade/Legends|stun grenades]] at the vehicle and Keth-Keth graffitied the OPS speeder, to make the attack appear as if is had been carried out by the \"[[Wookiee Liberation Front]],\" a name that he made up on the spur of the moment. The WOLF later developed into a fully-fledged organization and Meelo tried to keep to herself the role that she had played in the group's \"formation.\"\n\nSome time later, Meelo and Keth-Keth journeyed to the [[City/Legends|city]] [[Hedrett]] on Cularin, where two [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] harassed the Jawa. After Keth-Keth attacked them with a [[stun glove]] and caused a stir, Meelo made her way to the [[Crosstown Bar]] in [[Gadrin]], to hide out while the situation cooled down. There, she played a game of [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] against a [[Bimm (Near-Human)|Bimm]], and she told her fellow [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]] the story of the WOLF's origins.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/lf20051215Meelov2|text=Life According to Meelo|int=Life According to Meelo|archivedate=20051230095842}} {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]"}}}]}}}}
