During the Mandalore Wars he was honored many times for his bravery.|[[Saul Karath]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Carth Onasi''', nicknamed '''Fleet''', was a famous [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] and an expert [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] born in [[3994 BBY]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Telos IV]], where he would later start a [[Onasi family|family]] with his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]], [[Morgana Onasi|Morgana]]; they had a son they named [[Dustil Onasi|Dustil]]. He served in the [[Republic Navy#Naval Starfighter Corps|Republic Naval Starfighter Corps]], fighting for the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] he loved above all else in such conflicts as the [[Mandalorian Wars]] against expanding [[Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders/Legends|Mandalorian]] clans, earning several honors for his bravery during combat. During the war, Onasi served under [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]], who would become his greatest ally and mentor. After the war ended, Onasi planned to leave the [[Republic Navy|Navy]] and return to Telos to be with his family.\n\nHowever, such plans were put to an end when war heroes [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak|Malak]], two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who had [[Revanchist|decided to fight]] in the war, turned on the Republic, becoming [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] while taking many Jedi that had followed him to war and the Republic soldiers who served under them with them when they created a [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] that would [[Jedi Civil War|oppose]] the Republic. During that conflict, Telos was [[Bombing of Telos IV|attacked]] by Karath&mdash;who bombed the planet from his [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], [[Leviathan (Interdictor-class cruiser)|''Leviathan'']], until it was made completely uninhabitable so he could prove his loyalty to the Sith. The [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|orbital bombardment]] killed Morgana while Dustil, being [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], was abducted by the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] so he could be [[Sith training|trained]] as a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]. Onasi swore to seek revenge against Karath for the death of his family and the destruction of his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]; he would hold that grudge for three [[Time/Legends|years]].\n\nAt that time, [[3956 BBY]], Onasi played a crucial role in the search for the [[Star Forge]], the Sith's super-productive space factory that continually fed their fleet new [[Starship/Legends|ships]]. He was stationed aboard the [[Hammerhead-class cruiser|''Hammerhead''-class cruiser]] ''[[Endar Spire]]'' over the planet [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] when it was [[Attack on the Endar Spire|attacked]] by the Sith, now lead by Malak after he had [[Capture of Darth Revan|usurped]] control from Revan. The former leader was then reprogrammed by the Jedi and made to forget his time as both a Jedi and a Sith before being placed in the Republic's armed forces aboard the ''Spire'', where he met Onasi as the two were both fleeing the doomed ship. They temporarily settled on Taris while [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|searching]] for [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Bastila Shan]], the only other person known to have survived the attack on the ''Endar Spire''.\n\nAfter finding her, the three fled Taris and Onasi would serve as the pilot of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', their personal starship, transporting the trio and a growing group of allies across the galaxy as they searched for [[Star Map]]s that would lead them to the Star Forge, a mission given to them by the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Jedi Council]]. As they traveled through the stars, Onasi was able to both find his son, who was then turned from the Sith ways by Revan and his father, as well as enact his revenge upon Karath, whom the group killed aboard the ''Leviathan''. Once the Star Forge was located and destroyed during the [[Battle of Rakata Prime]], Onasi was made an admiral in the Republic Navy, taking a leading role in the effort to help the Republic recover in the wake of the two subsequent wars. To this end, Onasi would later defend Telos from another [[Battle of Telos IV|Sith attack]] during another [[Dark Wars|conflict]] that would stem from the Jedi Civil War Revan and Malak began almost a decade before.\n\n==Biography==\n===Mandalorian Wars===\n{{Quote|I'm not a warrior, I'm a soldier.

At this point he was widely referred to by a pilot nickname, Fleet.<ref name=\"DOF2\" /> He participated in several battles, including the Battles of [[Battle of Vanquo|Vanquo]] and [[Battle of Serroco|Serroco]], where he met the fugitive Padawan [[Zayne Carrick]], disguised as a janitor named Shad Camper.<ref name=\"DOF2\" />\n\nThe pair would later meet up again when \"Shad Camper\" stowed aboard Onasi's cargo ship. Carrick asked Onasi to bring him to [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Saul Karath]] due to a [[Force vision/Legends|vision]] he had had of the Mandalorians attacking Serroco. At first, Onasi believed him to be a lunatic. After Carrick then demonstrated that he was in fact a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], Onasi agreed to take him to Karath, though admitted they might get themselves killed for interrupting the admiral during battle preparations.<ref name=\"DOF3\" />\n\n[[File:CarthMeetsZayne.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Zayne Carrick proving his Jedi abilities to an initially skeptical Carth Onasi by pulling his blaster from him]]\nOnasi brought him to Admiral Karath on the bridge of the ''Courageous''. Karath was impressed with Onasi, not for returning Shad Camper, but for bringing him the fugitive Zayne Carrick. As Carrick protested his innocence of the [[Padawan Massacre|Padawan Massacre of Taris]], Karath ordered Onasi to inform the [[Revanchist]]s, Jedi who decided to fight in the Mandalorian Wars, of Carrick's capture. Instead, Onasi attempted to contact a Jedi named [[Darth Malak|Squint]], whom Carrick said could prove his innocence. Despite being unable to make contact with Squint who was on a mission elsewhere, and so with his doubts as to Carrick's innocence, Onasi nevertheless believed his story of the vision of the destruction of the [[Stereb cities]]. As such, Onasi contacted seventeen cities on the planets surface to set off tornado alarms&mdash;hoping to drive anyone into underground shelters. Sure enough, Carrick's vision came true when the Mandalorians launched [[Nuclear bomb|nuclear missiles]] and killed billions on Serroco.<ref name=\"DOF3\" />\n\nWhen Carrick was sealed in a cell, Onasi paid him a visit and informed him of the possibility of survival on the surface.<ref name=\"DOF3\" /> However, the ''Courageous'' came under attack by the Mandalorians. While the rest of the crew was ordered to evacuate, Onasi, Admiral Karath and other Republic forces made their stand on the vessel as Mandalorian shock troopers boarded it. Backed into the brig, Karath ordered for Zayne Carrick's cell to opened to acquire his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], to cut into the cargo bays. However, his lightsaber was kept on board Onasi's ship, the ''[[Deadweight]]''. Carrick had been prying out the bolts on the walls with the Force for several days and escaped, meeting Onasi aboard the ship. Karath reluctantly took Carrick with them as they fled the ''Courageous'' on the ''Deadweight''.<ref name=\"noa2\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 17|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 17]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Carthzayneescapes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Carrick \"escapes\" from Onasi.]]\nShortly after escaping from the Mandalorians, the ''Deadweight'' received a transmission from [[Eejee]], [[Arkoh Adasca]]'s servant, requesting Karath's presence at a meeting aboard the ''[[Arkanian Legacy]]''. After being informed about the [[Exogorth/Legends|exogorths]], Karath quickly redirected the ship to the ''Legacy''. Onasi accompanied Karath, Morris, and Carrick onto Adasca's ship, and was just as shocked as his superiors at the arrival of [[Mandalore the Ultimate]], [[Mandalore (title)|leader]] of the Mandalorians.<ref name=\"doh1\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 19|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 19]]</ref>\n\nDisgusted at what he witnessed, as the exogorths were tested before Saul Karath and Mandalore the Ultimate, Carth Onasi excused himself to the ''Deadweight''.<ref name=\"doh2\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 20|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 20]]</ref> However, Onasi only visited it to grab Zayne Carrick's gear and lightsaber. Onasi returned his gear to Carrick when he discovered [[Lucien Draay]] and him standing about a piles of broken [[HK-24 series assassin droid|HK-24]] units. Carrick came up with a plan stop Adasca. The plan would trick Mandalore the Ultimate into thinking Adasca had lured him into a trap. Carrick, disguised as a Mandalorian, shoved Onasi upon their return to the observatory, creating a distraction for Carrick to get close enough to Mandalore and Adasca. Lucien revealed himself and with the thought that Adasca betrayed him, Mandalore and his warriors opened fire on the Jedi and Adasca's HK-24 units. During the [[First Battle of Omonoth|brawl]], the elderly [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]], [[Gorman Vandrayk]], seized control of the exogorths and plunged them into the ''Arkanian Legacy'' observatory, killing Arkoh Adasca. Onasi, Carrick and the Jedi managed to escape although Mandalore had also escaped to his shuttle. During the fight, Saul Karath was injured and needed to be carried back to the ''Deadweight'', Morvis commanded Onasi to take Carrick. However, Onasi did not view Carrick as an enemy and allowed him to go free, bidding him farewell. Karath, Onasi, and Morvis successfully escaped the crumbling ship in the ''Deadweight'' and later reported to the Republic on the events on the ''Legacy''.<ref name=\"doh3\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 21|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 21]]</ref>\n\nDespite the successful escape, Onasi was removed from his bridge post for \"losing\" [[Zayne Carrick]] on the ''Arkanian Legacy''. He was reassigned to the [[Lance Squadron]], whose [[Aurek-class tactical strikefighter|Aurek fighters]] were preventing Carrick from reaching [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] several months later. When ''[[Moomo Williwaw]]''&mdash;the ship Carrick was on&mdash;entered Coruscant space, the squadron moved to intercept. Onasi demanded the ship to identify itself only to find that \"Shad Camper\" was indeed on board. Not being able to let Zayne escape again, he commanded the squadron to intercept the intruder. When they chased the ''Williwaw'' to the ''Swiftsure'', Onasi's wingmate noticed that the ''Deadweight'' was flying away. He allowed his supply carrier to go, knowing that Zayne was on it.<ref name=\"KOTOR31\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 31|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 31]]</ref> Despite letting Carrick escape once more, Onasi redeemed his post on the bridge of ''Swiftsure'' and was present for the [[Incident near Ithor system|capture]] of the [[Gladiator (Crucible)|''Gladiator'']].<ref>[[Knights of the Old Republic 49|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 49]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Onasi_family.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Onasi reunites with his family after the war.]]\nOnasi continued to serve with the Republic forces fighting alongside the Revanchists for the remainder of the war, which eventually began to turn in the Republic's favor. The Republic and its Jedi allies eventually ended the conflict when Mandalore the Ultimate was slain and the majority of the Mandalorian forces were [[Battle of Malachor V|destroyed]] during the final battle of the war. While the Revanchists pursued the remaining Mandalorians into parts unknown, Onasi and the Republic forces returned home, hailed as heroes for their role in protecting the Republic.<ref name=\"Timeline9\">''[[Timeline 9: The Mandalorian Wars]]''</ref>\n\n===Jedi Civil War===\n{{Quote|I&hellip; could have stopped him.

Upon hearing the news, Onasi rushed back to his home planet but was too late to save his wife, who died in his arms. To add to his emotional pain, his son had disappeared, and though Onasi searched for him, he eventually came to the conclusion that Dustil was dead. These events deeply affected Onasi, who from that point onwards, resolved never to trust anybody, lest he suffer betrayal again. He swore that if he ever had the opportunity, he would kill Saul Karath for what he had done.<ref name=\"KTRE3\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' while Onasi is speaking to Revan after getting to know him better</ref>\n\n[[File:Carth_Onasi.png|thumb|right|150px|Onasi during his travels with Revan.]]\nOnasi eventually found himself on board the ''[[Endar Spire]]'' as mostly an advisor, carrying [[Bastila Shan]], a Jedi whose abilities were vital to the success of the war effort. However, the ship was attacked and boarded by Sith forces over the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] world of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. When Bastila and the remainder of the crew abandoned ship, Onasi remained behind to wait for and help survivors; however, there remained only one lone Republic soldier. The pair then took the last escape pod and crash-landed onto the planet below.<ref name=\"KTRES2\" />\n\nThe other soldier was in fact Revan, though mentally reprogrammed by the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] and using a different name.<ref name=\"KTRL\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' revealed by Malak while the group is aboard the ''Leviathan''</ref> Revan was knocked out in the escape pod's rough landing, and Onasi had to care for him for some time before he recovered consciousness.<ref name=\"KTRT2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' when Revan awakes after crash-landing on Taris</ref> When Revan came around, they began exploring Taris, [[Rescue of Bastila Shan|searching for information concerning Bastila's whereabouts]].

The ''Ebon Hawk'' was held by local crime lord [[Davik Kang]], and the group recruited the aid of the Mandalorian [[Canderous Ordo]] to steal it. They also required clearance codes to escape from Taris, and so three of the group broke into the local Sith base and obtained the codes. Retrieving the remaining members, they made it past the Sith blockade and escaped Taris.<ref name=\"KTRT4\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' after being helped by Canderous Ordo to get into and steal Davik's prized ship</ref>\n\nUpon their escape from the Sith bombardment of Taris, Onasi became pilot of the newly-acquired ''Ebon Hawk'', which the group then used to reach the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]].<ref name=\"KTRD\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' directly after leaving Taris</ref> As Bastila discussed the matter of their Force-sensitive companion with the Dantooine Council, Onasi expressed his disgruntlement with being \"left out of the loop\". Eventually it was decided to train Revan, who had no knowledge of his former identity, as a Jedi. Shortly afterwards, the Council gave Bastila and the new Jedi Padawan an assignment to discover the location of the [[Star Forge]]&mdash;an assignment Onasi begrudgingly assisted them with, despite feeling he could be doing more good on the front lines.<ref name=\"KTRD2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' while the group is on Dantooine</ref>\n\nThe journey for the Star Forge took the crew of the Ebon Hawk to the planets [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], [[Manaan/Legends|Manaan]] and [[Korriban]]. On these four planets, the group searched for ancient artifacts known as [[Star Map]]s. Onasi grew suspicious of Revan's presence with them, wondering why the Jedi Council would send a neophyte Padawan along with them on their quest. Onasi eventually demanded that Revan tell him what the Jedi Council had told him&mdash;something Bastila refused herself to do. Revan did inform Onasi of the [[Force bond]] he and Bastila shared. However, Onasi did not believe that was the only reason why Revan was with them&mdash;still unaware of Revan's true identity as the former Dark Lord, the true reason behind Revan's presence.<ref name=\"KTRD3\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' Revan and Onasi's argument after finding the first Star Map.</ref>\n\n====Revenge====\n{{Quote|I've fought Saul for years, now, and if I ever catch up to him&hellip; he will regret what he's done.

On the bridge, they faced Saul Karath, allowing Onasi to finally exact his revenge, though Revan counseled him to avoid giving in to his hatred.

He was a quick draw, and also skilled in dual weapon fighting.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\n[[Trask Ulgo]] described Onasi as \"''one of the Republic's best pilots''.\"<ref name=\"KTRE\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' at the beginning of the game, after speaking with Trask</ref> During his travels with Revan, Onasi proved his skill in flying when he flew the ''Ebon Hawk'' across the galaxy.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Close encounters that demonstrated his skill included piloting the ''Ebon Hawk'' out of the Sith orbital bombardment of Taris, landing the ''Hawk'' safely on the surface of Lehon when its stabilizers were fried, and penetrating the Sith fleet surrounding the Star Forge with only a light starfighter escort. Onasi also demonstrated some mechanical aptitude, as when he pinpointed the problems with the ''Hawk'' after the Lehon landing and later repaired the ship.<ref name=\"KTRLH2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' during and after their crash-landing on Lehon</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:CarthOnasiBlaster.png|thumb|200px|right|Carth Onasi weilding his personal blaster]]\nOnasi wore a light brown [[Jacket/Legends|jacket]], along with dark brown pants and black boots. He wore a brown blaster [[Holster/Legends|holster]] strapped to his right hip.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> Later, during the [[First Jedi Purge]], he wore a red and white heavy [[Armor/Legends|armor]] suit.<ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" />\n\nOnasi carried a [[Carth's blaster|personal blaster pistol]] based on an [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] design, upgraded with more modular Republic technology. It bore his family symbol, making it immediately recognizable. He also carried a second blaster pistol, but unlike his primary weapon, it was a standard Republic model.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nIn her journeys, Meetra Surik came in possession of a blaster pistol that bore the Onasi family symbol. It is likely that Onasi lost the pistol sometime after his adventures with Revan, although it is also possible that this was simply a replica, or a weapon belonging to some other member of the Onasi family.<ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Carth_art.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Concept art of Onasi]]\nCarth Onasi was created for the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', in which he serves as a playable character. Onasi was written by [[David Gaider]] in the first game,<ref name=\"Twitter\">{{Twitter|davidgaider|status/1389640959072215040|David Gaider|quote=I wrote Carth, HK-47, the Sith planet Korriban (and the Code of the Sith!), a lot of Bastila...|archivedate=20210505072220}}</ref> and was voiced by [[Raphael Sbarge]] in both the game<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /> and its [[2004]] sequel, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''.<ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" /> Prior to Sbarge's casting, Carth was voiced by Mark Meer in an early build demo of the game.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{Youtube|video=2eb2prLk7y0|text=Mark Meer Interview Commader Shepard Mass Effect|channel=channel/UCJ_ZX8oSKiv3vPKPfgpNyUQ|channelname=NationFusion|archivedate=20160101153739}}</ref> In the games, his name is misspelled as \"Carth Onassi\" in the player-character's dialogue texts.<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /><ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" /> Onasi is later mentioned in the in-game Codex for the video game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'',<ref name=\"TOR\">''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''</ref> and the [[2012]] reference guide ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]'' identified Tatooine as one of Onasi's possible resting places.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> A game update for ''The Old Republic'' later made Onasi's outfit available for purchase by players through the game's Cartel Market system.<ref name=\"Blog Shipment\">{{TORweb|url=info/news/blog/20130313-0|text=Cartel Market Shipment Two: The Contraband Packs}}</ref> Onasi, along with Zaalbar, Bastila Shan, Canderous Ordo, and Mission Vao, was inspired by [[James Ohlen]]'s work on roleplaying campaigns for [[West End Games]].<ref name=\"Insider\">{{InsiderCite|144|Gaming the Expanded Universe: Ten Years of Knights of the Old Republic}}</ref>\n\n===Alternate choices===\nDepending on the player's choices, several different outcomes are possible in ''Knights of the Old Republic''. If the player, as Revan, decides to re-assume the title of Dark Lord of the Sith via the non-[[canon]]ical ending of the game, Onasi, outnumbered, flees when he is told. Consequently, he does not appear in the sequel if the player says that Revan followed the dark side, and is instead replaced by Admiral [[Cede]].<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nJust as the male Revan can engage in a romantic sub-plot with Bastila, the female Revan can with Onasi, and if the player sets Revan as a light-sided female in ''The Sith Lords'', then Onasi will express his feelings for Revan to Meetra Surik, the game's primary player character. The character of [[Kreia|Darth Traya]] will also comment that \"it would have helped had she made him understand, but a hero of the Republic, no matter how brave, cannot understand war as Revan did.\"<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n\nAdditionally, Onasi originally had alternate lines for his devastation in finding out who Revan is if the player is female and has romanced Onasi up to that point.<ref name=\"DLG\">''Found in the ''Knights of the Old Republic'' .dlg files''</ref> If the player has both romanced Onasi and turned to the dark side, then the player will have the option of killing Onasi herself or have Bastila finish it. In a cut-scene that did not make it to the final game, Revan had a third option to kill Bastila and die aboard the Star Forge with Onasi. It was not placed in the final version because the developers did not have enough time to finish it for the game. However, these features can be returned to the game through modding.<ref name=\"DLG\" />\n\n===''Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords''===\n{{Quote|Mockery: Oh Master, I do not trust you! I cannot trust you, or anyone ever again!|HK-47's mockery of Carth|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nIn ''The Sith Lords'', if Meetra Surik has enough influence with [[HK-47]], then the droid will mock Onasi's distrust of other people in ''Knights of the Old Republic''.<ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" />\n\nIf Revan is set as light side, and a male Surik is played, then [[Mical]] is established as reporting directly to Onasi. In cut content of the game however, if Surik is a female, then later in the game, Mical would report to Onasi, again revealing that he has found that which hunts the Jedi and informing Onasi of the impending attack on Telos.<ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" />\n\n===Comics===\n[[File:Carthonasipossible.jpg|thumb|150px|Onasi's appearance as a helmsman in [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Flashpoint|''Flashpoint'']]|right]]\nAccording to [[John Jackson Miller]], author of the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (comic series)|''Knights of the Old Republic'' comic series]], a bearded man in a helmet depicted on the bridge of the ''Courageous'' in the series' [[Knights of the Old Republic 8|eighth issue]] was not actually meant to be Onasi. Artist [[Dustin Weaver]] was not told to draw anyone specific, so he based the man's appearance on Miller himself. However, the writer now considers it the first appearance of Onasi in the comic series.<ref>{{Faraway|comics/swknights/swkotor14.html|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic #14''|archivedate=20170211053723}}</ref> Onasi later went on to play a large role in several of the series' story arcs.<ref name=\"DOF2\" /><ref name=\"doh1\" />\n\nMiller has also said that, of the secondary characters originating in the two ''Knights of the Old Republic'' video games, Onasi was the one that he enjoyed writing the most, especially concerning the \"big-brother/kid-brother dynamic\" during Onasi's scenes with Zayne Carrick.<ref name=\"Faraway\">{{Faraway|blog/2010/02/16/kotor-countdown-2-just-asked-questions|KOTOR Countdown #2: Just-Asked-Questions, The Finale!|archivedate=20200805132619}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Carth Onasi|imagecat=Images of Carth Onasi}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 8|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 8]] {{Ret}}\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 14|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 14]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 15|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 15]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 17|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 17]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 18|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 18]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Daze of Hate]]''\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 31|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 31]]\n*[[Knights of the Old Republic 49|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 49]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''\n*''[[Timeline 9: The Mandalorian Wars]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*[[Cartel Market|''Star Wars: The Old Republic'' Cartel Market]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*{{KOTORbackups|13}}\n*{{KOTORbackups|16}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{TORweb|url=info/news/blog/20130313-0|text=Cartel Market Shipment Two: The Contraband Packs}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|carthonasi|Onasi, Carth|archivedate=20100328200117}}\n*{{InsiderCite|144|Gaming the Expanded Universe: Ten Years of Knights of the Old Republic}}\n*{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}\n\n{{Start_box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=Pilot of the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]''<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n|years=[[3956 BBY]]<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /><ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n|before=[[Hudrow]]<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" />\n|before-years=&mdash;3956 BBY<ref name=\"Knights of the Old Republic\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\n|after=[[Atton Rand]]<ref name=\"JVS\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref><ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" />\n|after-years=[[3951 BBY]]<ref name=\"JVS\" /><ref name=\"The Sith Lords\" />}}\n{{End_box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Scroll_box|width=100%|content={{Reflist}}}}\n\n{{K1char}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Carth Onasi#legends\n|el=\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8 \u039f\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\n|es=Carth Onasi\n|fr=Carth Onasi\n|hu=Carth Onasi\n|it=Carth Onasi\n|pl=Carth Onasi\n|pt=Legends:Carth Onasi\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041e\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Onasi, Carth}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Republic Navy admirals]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
