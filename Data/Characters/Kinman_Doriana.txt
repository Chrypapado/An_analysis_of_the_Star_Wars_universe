Concerned that the Far Outsiders' efforts would accelerate if they were able to intercept the upcoming [[Outbound Flight Project|Outbound Flight]] mission, Sidious and Doriana arranged for its destruction. Due to the expected presence of Jedi&ndash;who were capable of manipulating the minds of organic beings&ndash;on Outbound Flight, Doriana proposed the use of [[Droid/Legends|droid]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] in the attack.<ref name=\"OF:18\" />\n\nFive years after Palpatine's election, Doriana was introduced to [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Jorus C'baoth]] in Chancellor Palpatine's inner office when C'baoth arrived to discuss the Outbound Flight project with Palpatine. During the meeting, Doriana proposed dispatching C'baoth to resolve a dispute between [[Barlok]] and the [[Corporate Alliance/Legends|Corporate Alliance]] as a means of persuading the Senate [[Financial Appropriations Committee|Appropriations Committee]] to undo reductions in the funding of the project. Palpatine and C'baoth were receptive and agreed to follow Doriana's suggestion. Dismissed by Palpatine, Doriana then returned to his apartment, where he made contact with Darth Sidious via [[Holoprojector/Legends|holoprojector]] and informed the Sith Lord of C'baoth's impending departure for Barlok.<ref name=\"OF:3\" /> Doriana recruited the [[Brolf]] known as [[Filvian (Brolf)|Patriot]] and his allies to carry out a plot against the Barlok negotiations, considering them ideal pawns.<ref name=\"OF:7\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 7</ref>\n\nOn Barlok, Doriana provided Patriot with a [[Datacard/Legends|data card]] that would act as a course director for a missile in what Doriana claimed was a planned attempt to assassinate C'baoth, [[Magistrate/Legends|Magistrate]] [[Passel Argente/Legends|Passel Argente]], and [[Guildmaster]] [[Gilfrome]] the following day.<ref name=\"OF:7\" /> In reality, the goal of Sidious and Doriana's scheme was merely to frighten both sides of the negotiations into accepting C'baoth's terms; Doriana had also applied a [[shroud-liquid]] sprayer to the missile to ensure the weapon would not be stopped until it reached the conference chamber, where C'baoth was expected to dramatically bring the weapon to a halt. Events occurred as planned at the negotiations, with Doriana observing the scene from a hotel room balcony, and Doriana subsequently made contact with Sidious via holoprojector again to report the operation's success. Sidious instructed Doriana to leave Barlok and return to his official business, and to become Chancellor Palpatine's personal liaison to the final preparations for Outbound Flight.<ref name=\"OF:9\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 9</ref>\n\n====Encounter with the Chiss====\n{{Quote|We intend no harm to you or your people. But I'm afraid the details of our mission must remain confidential.''\"<br />\"''I'm afraid in turn that your reassurances are insufficient.|Doriana meets Commander Thrawn|Outbound Flight (novel)}}\nThree weeks before Outbound Flight was scheduled to leave [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] space, Doriana retrieved the final crew and passenger list for the voyage from [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Pakmillu]] on [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]]. While examining the list, Doriana noticed the presence of three additional Jedi: C'baoth's former [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Lorana Jinzler]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and Kenobi's Padawan [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]]. Doriana traveled by shuttle to the [[Yavvitiri Spaceport]], where he passed through security to reach the restricted zone on the far side of the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] where his ship was berthed. Inside his ship, Doriana met with Trade Federation [[Vicelord]] [[Siv Kav]] before making another report to Darth Sidious, whom Doriana informed of the additional Jedi on Outbound Flight. Sidious initially ordered Doriana to ensure Anakin Skywalker was removed from the ship, but to Doriana's relief, he then decided to deal with Skywalker himself. Sidious also directed Doriana to intercept Outbound Flight at the first of its two planned navigational checks outside Republic space.<ref name=\"OF:13\" />\n\nDoriana and Kav boarded the Trade Federation [[Battleship/Legends|battleship]] ''[[Darkvenge]]'' and traveled to the coordinates of Outbound Flight's first stop as part of a fifteen-ship [[Special Task Force One|task force]]&ndash;which, under Sidious's orders, was staffed by crews of minimal size to reduce the risk of their plot being discovered. Doriana privately worried that Sidious intended to eliminate any survivors of the mission, and he felt that the reduced crew sizes would work in Sidious's favor if this was indeed the case. Outbound Flight was expected to arrive at the location in a little over eleven days, and Doriana convinced Kav to ensure their task force's preparedness for the upcoming attack by running training exercises over that time.<ref name=\"OF:15\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 15</ref> Prior to Outbound Flight's arrival, however, the task force was discovered by a group of [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Force|Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet]] vessels led by [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]], who hailed the fleet and demanded that they identify themselves and state their intentions.<ref name=\"OF:16\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 16</ref>\n\nHauled out of bed, Doriana reached the bridge of the ''Darkvenge'' ten minutes after the Chiss established contact. Noticing that Mitth'raw'nuruodo spoke [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], Doriana imagined that the commander might be a [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] who possessed some knowledge of the outer reaches of the Republic, or that he and his forces might have been sent as spies by the Jedi, by Palpatine, or by some other party. Doriana, unlike Kav, did not perceive the Chiss fleet as a definite threat, and introduced himself to Thrawn under the alias of \"Commander Stratis\" through an open hailing channel. Refusing to disclose any details regarding their mission, Doriana failed to convince Thrawn that his task force posed no threat to Thrawn or his people. The discussion was cut short by an impatient and overconfident Kav, who ordered an attack on Thrawn's forces.<ref name=\"OF:16\" />\n\nAs the [[Destruction of Special Task Force One|engagement]] began, Doriana continued to urge caution from Kav, and unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Vicelord not to split the fleet by sending the [[Keeper (Lucrehulk-class battleship)|''Keeper'']] to enter the battle. Chiss fighters then used [[Conner net]]s to create a gap in the task force's defensive screen of starfighters, and Doriana demanded that Kav activate the rest of their starfighters. Kav obeyed Doriana's command, only for the Chiss to jam the task force's communication signals, taking all their starfighters offline. All vessels in the task force except the ''Darkvenge'' were subsequently destroyed or disabled, and Doriana directed Kav to surrender to the Chiss attackers.<ref name=\"OF:16\" /> Commander Thrawn then boarded the ''Darkvenge'' and met Doriana and Kav on the ship's bridge. Thrawn was accompanied by two Chiss guards and a Human named [[Jorj Car'das]], whom he introduced as a prisoner and a suspected spy. Doriana, however, correctly deduced that this was a deception to make him believe Thrawn would not listen to Car'das's advice.<ref name=\"OF:17\" />\n\nAgain, Thrawn asked Doriana to explain the purpose of his task force's presence. Doriana led Thrawn to Kav's command office, where&ndash;while seated in Vicelord Kav's chair&ndash;he told Thrawn of the Outbound Flight mission and attempted to convince him that the Jedi on board would attempt to impose their will on Thrawn's people if they traveled through [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss space]] in the course of their mission. Noting the presence of Car'das, Doriana attempted to portray the Jedi in a negative fashion while avoiding any falsehoods that would be obvious to a being who was familiar with them. After Doriana finished speaking, Thrawn ordered him and Kav to remain on the bridge of the ''Darkvenge'', and informed Doriana that a Chiss team would soon board to examine the ship and its equipment. Doriana agreed to cooperate, overruling Kav's protestations. After Thrawn's departure, Doriana explained to a still-defiant Kav that he had formulated a new strategy to ensure that Sidious's mission was completed: He would persuade Thrawn to destroy Outbound Flight.<ref name=\"OF:17\" />\n\n====Alliance with Thrawn====\n{{Quote|Vicelord, I strongly suggest you remember our ultimate objective here. We've been sent to destroy Outbound Flight. Without Mitth'raw'nuruodo's aid, we have no chance of doing that.|Doriana reasons with Kav|Outbound Flight (novel)}}\nTwo days after the initial meeting with Thrawn, the ''Darkvenge'' completed its voyage to a location specified by Thrawn, where Doriana welcomed Thrawn onto the bridge once again. Thrawn ordered Doriana to begin unloading the battleship's droid starfighters for transport to a nearby [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]]. Curious as to why Thrawn wanted the starfighters removed from the ''Darkvenge'', Doriana asked Thrawn if he intended to stop Outbound Flight. Thrawn, who suspected Doriana's task force had been allied with Outbound Flight rather than seeking to destroy it, stated that he would only do so if Doriana revealed his true motivations. In response, Doriana led Thrawn into the office where they had conferred before, where he revealed his true identity, his dual allegiances to Chancellor Palpatine and Darth Sidious, and his knowledge of the Far Outsiders. Via holoprojector, Doriana then introduced Thrawn to Sidious, who approved of Thrawn's role in their plot.<ref name=\"OF:18\" />\n\nAfter communications with Sidious concluded, Thrawn requested a full technical readout on Outbound Flight from Doriana and informed him that, in addition to the droid starfighters, he would need two [[Droideka/Legends|droidekas]] and four [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] packed and loaded aboard his long-range shuttle for transport to his base. Doriana complied with Thrawn's orders, though he suspected that Vicelord Kav would be displeased by such concessions. Doriana also advised Thrawn not to attempt to adapt the droidekas' force shields for use by his warriors due to the hazardous magnetic fields and radiation involved with the technology.<ref name=\"OF:18\" /> Later, after the last group of droid starfighters had been deployed to the asteroid, Doriana went to the Supreme Officers' dining room of the ''Darkvenge'' to get something to eat. Noticing a fuming Kav seated at a corner table and wary of provoking the vicelord, Doriana ordered the serving droid to a table on the opposite side of the room.<ref name=\"OF:19\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 19</ref>\n\nDoriana was halfway through his dinner when Kav made his way across the room and informed him that Thrawn had ordered the droid starfighters reprogrammed for close-range attacks. Kav expected this strategy to fail and explained to Doriana&ndash;who considered the same strategy feasible, but risky&ndash;that he had ordered the creation of a secondary attack pattern, which he would activate if and when Thrawn's primary pattern failed. Though disgusted by Kav's intent to prove himself superior to Thrawn at the potential expense of their mission, Doriana decided that the vicelord's plan would probably result in success. Doriana ultimately agreed to Kav's plan, but pointed out that they would need to be on the bridge of Thrawn's ship when the battle with Outbound Flight began. By this time, Doriana had come to the conclusion that, as a witness to Sidious's plans, Thrawn would have to be eliminated. Doriana had been greatly impressed by Thrawn's tactical abilities, however, and considered his death an unfortunate necessity.<ref name=\"OF:19\" />\n\n====Destroying Outbound Flight====\n{{Quote|Time to join the party?''\"<br />\"''No. Time to start one of our own.|Doriana and Thrawn, as the attack on Outbound Flight commences|Outbound Flight (novel)}}\n[[File:Outbound_Flight.jpg|thumb|Doriana looks on as Commander Thrawn is Force choked by Jorus C'baoth]]\nDoriana, along with Kav, was allowed onto the bridge of Thrawn's ''[[Springhawk/Legends|Springhawk]]'', which traveled to a system that lay between Outbound Flight's previous stop and the system in which the ambush had initially been planned to take place. There, Thrawn used a [[Gravity well projector/Legends|gravity projector]] to pull Outbound Flight out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]; the fact that the Chiss possessed such technology, which was unavailable in the Republic, concerned Doriana. In defiance of Thrawn, Kav immediately moved to launch the droid starfighters by activating his secret programming layer. Fearing that Outbound Flight might escape if Kav interfered with Thrawn's plans, Doriana attempted to grab Kav's comm activator. Doriana moved too late to stop Kav, but Thrawn had already discovered Kav's second programming layer and removed it.<ref name=\"OF:20\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 20</ref>\n\nThrawn then opened a communications channel with Outbound Flight, threatening to destroy them if they refused to return to Republic space, and gave them one hour to consider the offer. Doriana then saw a force of hundreds of alien ships appear at the edge of Thrawn's gravity trap, and Thrawn informed him that the vessels belonged to the nomadic [[Vagaari/Legends|Vagaari]].<ref name=\"OF:21\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 21</ref> The Jedi on board Outbound Flight mentally incapacitated the Vagaari&ndash;a feat that unnerved Doriana&ndash;and Thrawn finally launched the droid starfighters against the Vagaari. Kav, who had expected the starfighters to be used against Outbound Flight, argued with Thrawn, who reminded Kav that the starfighters were not the only Neimoidian technology he had seized. This statement startled Doriana, who feared that the droidekas Thrawn had taken from the ''Darkvenge'' had been placed behind him and Kav. Doriana saw no such thing when he turned around, however, and Thrawn revealed that the droidekas were in fact on the bridge of the Vagaari flagship.<ref name=\"OF:22\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 22</ref>\n\nWhile the starfighters attacked the Vagaari ships, the ''Springhawk'' and the rest of the Chiss ships moved to attack Outbound Flight, and Thrawn's forces destroyed the mission's weapons and shield generators with an efficiency that impressed Doriana. To Doriana's surprise, the Chiss then pulled away from their attack, and Thrawn opened communications with Outbound Flight once again. Thrawn repeated his previous ultimatum, eventually receiving a response from an injured Jorus C'baoth. Seeing C'baoth still alive, Doriana urged Thrawn to simply destroy Outbound Flight. Thrawn, however, unsuccessfully attempted to reason with C'baoth, who began choking him through the Force. Doriana reflexively grabbed at Thrawn's collar in a futile attempt to free him from C'baoth's hold before being pushed aside by the bridge crew of the ''Springhawk''. Desperate to stop C'baoth, Doriana then activated a switch on the ship's control board that redirected the starfighters from the Vagaari fleet to Outbound Flight.<ref name=\"OF:22\" />\n\nDoriana watched as the starfighters flew into a renewed attack on Outbound Flight in which C'baoth was killed, saving Thrawn from certain death. Thrawn then informed Doriana that ten pairs of the starfighters had been equipped with [[Radiation/Legends|radiation]] [[Radiation bomb|weapons]] that had been intended for the Vagaari, and shipboard combat against those Vagaari who remained in the disabled ships would be necessary as a result of their use against Outbound Flight. With Outbound Flight destroyed and its Jedi dead, Doriana decided that eliminating Thrawn was the only task that remained before his mission was complete. Doriana thought he might be able to kill Thrawn undetected amidst the confusion of shipboard fighting, and after apologizing for his unauthorized redirection of the starfighters, he requested and obtained permission from Thrawn to join the Chiss forces in their attack on the Vagaari remnants&ndash;ostensibly out of a desire to observe Chiss soldiers in action.<ref name=\"OF:22\" />\n\n====Completing the mission====\n{{Quote|A moment ago you spoke of trust between us. What exactly did you have in mind?''\"<br />\"''For the moment, nothing. Each of us has our own peoples to defend and our own politics to deal with. But in the future, who can tell?

Doriana was surprised by Car'das's presence on board the ship; Thrawn confirmed to Doriana that Car'das was not a spy, and that his accusations to the contrary on the ''Darkvenge'' were meant to protect [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Ar'alani/Legends|Ar'alani]]. Doriana immediately understood that Ar'alani had to avoid official involvement in the events surrounding Outbound Flight, leaving Thrawn and Car'das to be held responsible. Car'das then inquired about the fate of Outbound Flight, and Thrawn and Doriana informed him of its destruction, with Doriana admitting that he had pressed the button that triggered the final starfighter attack. Doriana never saw an opportunity to assassinate Thrawn during the trip to the Vagaari fleet, and returned to the ''Springhawk'' while Thrawn departed to a transport ship to meet with Ar'alani. It occurred to Doriana that Car'das, who he presumed would soon return to Republic space, would have to be silenced after Thrawn was killed.<ref name=\"OF:23\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 23</ref>\n\nIn a prep room on the ''Springhawk'', Doriana removed his vac suit while informing Kav that Thrawn was still alive. Kav, in turn, provided Doriana with a [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|hold-out blaster]], which Doriana concealed in his pocket. Doriana then informed Kav of Thrawn's whereabouts and asked Kav to let him decide the timing of the assassination. A pair of Chiss later escorted Doriana to the command bridge of another Chiss ship, where [[Aristocra/Legends|Aristocra]] [[Chaf'orm'bintrano]] alleged that Doriana had planned to attack the Chiss Ascendancy. With Thrawn translating the conversation, Doriana denied the accusations that he or Outbound Flight had acted aggressively toward the Chiss and claimed that he was an ambassador of the Galactic Republic who had been on a mission of goodwill and exploration. Doriana also disputed Chaf'orm'bintrano's claim to the remains of Outbound Flight&ndash;arguing that, as a representative of the government that had launched the mission, full salvage rights belonged to him&ndash;and demanded a hearing and judgment before any Chiss were allowed to board the craft.<ref name=\"OF:23\" />\n\nWhile Thrawn, Chaf'orm'bintrano, and a third Chiss argued, Doriana gazed out the bridge canopy and noticed Outbound Flight jump to [[Lightspeed/Legends|lightspeed]]. Doriana realized that Thrawn had orchestrated the ongoing confrontation to stall for time while his associates took control of Outbound Flight, and assumed that the uncertainty he had created over the craft's ownership comprised another element of Thrawn's scheme. Impressed again by Thrawn's strategic abilities, Doriana then interrupted the three Chiss to notify them of Outbound Flight's departure.<ref name=\"OF:23\" /> Doriana, along with Thrawn and Car'das, subsequently faced threats of prosecution for treason from Chaf'orm'bintrano. Ar'alani pointed out in response that non-Chiss could not be charged with treason, and Thrawn forced Chaf'form'bintrano to back down by threatening to withhold his gravfield projector technology from the Chiss Defense Fleet. Ar'alani then released Doriana and Car'das to Thrawn, who allowed Doriana and Kav to return to the ''Darkvenge''.<ref name=\"OF:24\">[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']], chapter 24</ref>\n\nThrawn led Doriana and Kav to the command office of the ''Darkvenge'', where he informed Doriana that he believed that there should be no further contact between the Chiss and the Republic. Doriana expressed confusion regarding Thrawn's statement, claiming that their partnership had proved mutually beneficial, to which Thrawn responded with a thinly-veiled threat to expose Doriana's efforts to sabotage Outbound Flight to the Republic. Fearing that Thrawn had somehow deduced or discovered his intent to assassinate him, Doriana reached toward his hold-out [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and gripped the weapon as he attempted to convince himself of the necessity of Thrawn's death. As Thrawn suspected, Doriana ultimately found himself unwilling to kill a being of such ingenuity, and set his blaster on an empty chair between himself and Thrawn. Kav then attempted to kill Thrawn with another hold-out blaster,\nbut the vicelord died instead when the shot was deflected back at him by a shield taken from one of the droidekas.<ref name=\"OF:24\" />\n\n[[File:Doriana_introduces_Thrawn_to_Palpatine.jpg|left|thumb|Doriana was responsible for bringing Thrawn to the attention of Darth Sidious]]\nNoting that the droideka's shield would not have prevented ''him'' from shooting Thrawn, Doriana inquired as to why Thrawn was willing to take such a risk. Thrawn replied that he had wished to determine whether he could trust Doriana, and revealed to Doriana that, unlike the Republic, the Chiss had [[Battle between the Chiss and Yuuzhan Vong|encountered]] the Far Outsiders before. Doriana frantically asked Thrawn for data regarding the numbers, weaponry, and combat performance of the Far Outsiders, believing that he might be able to obtain forgiveness for the loss of the Trade Federation task force if he provided Sidious with such information. Doriana and Thrawn ultimately agreed to work toward the goal of a potential alliance between the Chiss and the Republic in the coming fight against the Far Outsiders, though Doriana felt that Sidious's hatred of non-Humans could make such efforts difficult. Thrawn finally declared that Doriana and the ''Darkvenge'' were free to leave, with Doriana bidding Thrawn to keep his hold-out blaster as a souvenir of their first victory together.<ref name=\"OF:24\" />\n\n====Arrangement with Car'das====\nPrior to his departure, Doriana discussed another matter with Thrawn. Claiming to be impressed by Jorj Car'das's infiltration of the Vagaari, Doriana asked Thrawn to deliver an invitation to the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]]: Doriana offered Car'das passage back to the Republic on the ''Darkvenge'', employment in creating and operation a private information network for him, several months of training, and access to some of the contacts and resources that were at his disposal in the Republic. Car'das accepted Doriana's offer,<ref name=\"OF:24\" /> and upon their return to Republic space, Doriana aided Car'das in the establishment of a smuggling operation that would also serve as a spy ring for Darth Sidious. Doriana did not disclose his involvement with Sidious to Car'das, however.<ref name=\"SV:109\">[[Scum and Villainy (sourcebook)|''Scum and Villainy'']], p. 109</ref>\n\n====Separatist Crisis====\n{{Quote|The committee is just as the Supreme Chancellor said it is, a steering committee to help in upcoming negotiations with the Separatists.
