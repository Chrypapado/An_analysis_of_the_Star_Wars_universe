She was a kind individual, and she found immense joy in bringing happiness to others through her handcrafted toys. She was skilled with a [[blaster]], however, and was not afraid to use one against those who intended to cause harm to other beings or her creations.\n\nZabaka had a slight feud with [[Bina]], the proprietor of the nearby [[Creature Stall]], as Bina's pets would often escape their containers and steal toys from Zabaka's shop. The Toydarian also had a great admiration for [[Oga Garra]], the owner of [[Oga's Cantina]] and [[Crime lord|crime boss]] in control of Black Spire Outpost.<ref name=\"Toymaker\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Zabaka_window.jpg|250px|thumb|Zabaka working behind her office window]]\nIn [[34 ABY]],<ref name=\"GE Date\">The events of ''[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire]]'' and those within [[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]] take place in [[34 ABY]], per the reasoning [[Template:Galaxy's_Edge_Date|here]].</ref> [[Resistance]] [[spy]] [[Vi Moradi]] arrived on Batuu to establish a Resistance outpost. [[Salju]], a [[Batuuan]] who operated [[Black Spire Station]], advised Moradi about Zabaka's loyalties to Garra which made the Toydarian unlikely to join the Resistance. Zabaka purchased carvings of a [[convor]] and a [[frog-dog]] made by former [[First Order]] [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[Archex]], and she told him to bring other items of similar quality to sell to her.<ref name=\"GE:BS\">''[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nZabaka was first named in an article on [[StarWars.com]] titled \"The Aliens, Droids, and Shops of ''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge.\" She was created as the shopkeeper for the retail location Toydarian Toymaker found within [[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]],<ref name=\"The Aliens, Droids, and Shops\">{{SW|url=news/the-aliens-droids-and-shops-of-star-wars-galaxys-edge|text=The Aliens, Droids, and Shops of ''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge}}</ref> the themed land that first opened at [[Wikipedia:Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] on [[May 31]], [[2019]].<ref name=\"A to Z\">{{D23|url=a-to-z/toydarian-toymaker|text=Disney A to Z: Toydarian Toymaker|archivedate=20200927174237}}</ref> She can be seen by customers in silhouette, flying around and working in her office behind a translucent window.<ref name=\"TT page\">{{Disney|subdomain=disneyworld|domain=go.com|url=shops/hollywood-studios/toydarian-toymaker/|text=Toydarian Toymaker|archivedate=20210425143208}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire]]''\n*[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire (audiobook)|''Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire'' audiobook]]\n*[[Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire|''Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire'' audiobook]]\n*{{SWGECite|Toydarian Toymaker}} {{1st}} {{C|Silhouette}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/the-aliens-droids-and-shops-of-star-wars-galaxys-edge|text=The Aliens, Droids, and Shops of ''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge}} {{1stID}}\n*{{SW|url=news/27-things-we-learned-about-star-wars-galaxys-edge|text=27 Things We Learned About ''Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge''}}\n*[[Star Wars: Datapad|''Star Wars'': Datapad]] {{C|Silhouette}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: Traveler's Guide to Batuu]]''\n*{{D23|url=a-to-z/toydarian-toymaker|text=Disney A to Z: Toydarian Toymaker|archivedate=20200927174237}}\n*{{SW|url=series/the-bad-batch/cornered-episode-guide|text=\"Cornered\" Episode Guide}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Batuu residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Toydarians]]"}}}]}}}}
