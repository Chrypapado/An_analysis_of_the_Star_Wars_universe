Kayson was also a supporter of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. He also owned several properties on [[Ord Mantell/Legends|Ord Mantell]], [[Kemal Station]], [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], [[Cranan 12]], and the [[Austan Asteroid Cluster]]. In addition to his ventures into greel wood harvesting, he also owned [[Galactic Recreational Equipment Industries]] and seven other companies all under the umbrella of [[MK Enterprises]]. He also owned a percentage of the holdings of [[Kwenn Space Station/Legends|Kwenn Space Station]].\n\nKayson avoided the Imperials during the rise of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]], after vehemently opposing [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Declaration of a New Order|ascension]] to [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]]. After paying numerous fines and issuing a public apology, he was allowed to continue with his normal business interests. Kayson was friends with [[Xenon Nnaksta]] and hired him to work at his company. Kayson also conferred with Nnaksta about the Rebel Alliance and probably convinced him to join their cause. Kayson also befriended [[Kassar Kosciusko]], after the latter saved Kayson's life on [[Pernam Minor]].\n\n[[Standard decade/Legends|Decades]] before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Kayson was visiting the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] Spaceport at [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], coming across an orphaned [[Alien/Legends|alien]] child of unknown [[Species/Legends|species]]. Taking pity on the hungry infant, he took the unnamed child into his care and raised him as his own, giving him all of the necessary business skills in addition to weapons usage and gun-running. The child matured, taking [[Kayson]]'s name as his own, and founded [[Kayson's Weapons Shop]], which was occasionally run by Meysen Kayson himself when required.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The Sand Tender: The Hammerhead's Tale]]\"\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|6|The Greel Wood Haven}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[Alliance Intelligence Reports]]'' {{C|As \"Meyser Kayson\"}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kayson, Meysen}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
