If you allow the Royal Onderon Militia to assume control of security, the terrorists may stop and discuss terms.|General Tandin, to King Sanjay Rash|The Soft War}}\nThe '''Royal Guard''' of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], also known as '''Iziz city guard''' and later as the '''Royal Onderon Milita''', was the [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] force that served the [[King/Legends|King]] of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]].\n\n==History==\n===Republic and Sith conflict===\n[[File:RoyalGuardCommander.png|thumb|right|200px|A Royal Guard [[Commander/Legends|commander]].]]\nBy [[3627 BBY]], the Royal Guard was divided during a political crisis, with many serving as the protectors of the [[Capital/Legends|capital city]] [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]]&mdash;under the [[Council of Lords|Noble council]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]&mdash;and others serving [[King/Legends|King]] [[Regalun Petryph|Petryph]] with the support of the Republic's enemies, the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]].\n\n===Clone Wars===\nAfter the ousting of King [[Ramsis Dendup/Legends|Ramsis Dendup]], [[General/Legends|General]] [[Tandin/Legends|Tandin]], the leader of the Royal [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] [[Militia/Legends|Militia]], swore his force's allegiance to the new king, [[Sanjay Rash/Legends|Sanjay Rash]]. However, when Rash attempted to publicly [[Death/Legends|execute]] Dendup, Tandin led the Royal Onderon Militia against the crown, rescuing Dendup and siding with the [[Onderon rebels/Legends|Onderon rebels]] against Rash's regime, which was being backed by General [[Kalani/Legends|Kalani]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].\n\nLater, they joined the rebels in the [[Onderon highlands/Legends|Onderon highlands]], and served as cavalry against the droid assault. Initially, their lances and mounts overwhelmed the battle droid forces and they proved to be competent soldiers in battle. Their lances, however, could do nothing against the air superiority of the Confederacy. Later, two of them escorted the king in an escape attempt, but were trailed by Commando Droids. They attempted to defeat the droids, but their short-range lance burst could not pierce the body armor of the droids in enough time before they were killed.\n\n==Equipment==\nDuring the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], guards wielded [[laser lance]]s and wore light armor. Additionally, they rode mounts into battle.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught]]''\n*{{TCW|The Soft War}} {{1st}}\n*{{TCW|Tipping Points}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=explore/the-clone-wars/ep504|text=\"The Soft War\" - ''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide}} {{1stID|Onderon royal militia and royal guard}}\n*{{TCWA|set=Onderon Guard}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.46]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30aa\u30f3\u30c0\u30ed\u30f3\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\n|ru=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f \u041e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Culture of Onderon]]\n[[Category:Onderon military personnel]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Separatist military units]]"}}}]}}}}
