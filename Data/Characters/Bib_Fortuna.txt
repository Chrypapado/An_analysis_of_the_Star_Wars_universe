He is most displeased with your hostility.|Bib Fortuna contacts the mercenaries following the battle|Star Wars: Commander}}\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War]] between the Empire and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], the Twi'lek remained in Jabba's service. A short time after the [[Battle of Yavin]], which had cost the Empire its [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station]], the Empire elected to open negotiations with Jabba, but a [[Heroes of Yavin|Rebel strike team]] took advantage of the negotiations to [[Assault on Cymoon|destroy]] [[Weapons Factory Alpha]]. Following that loss, the Empire moved negotiations to take place at Jabba's Palace, but the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader arrived a day early to request [[bounty hunter]]s for private business. After Vader arrived and [[Death|killed]] two [[Gamorrean Warrior]]s, Fortuna ran to the [[Sith]] to speak with him, only to be met with a [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|lightsaber]] and a demand to see Jabba. Rushing to his master, Fortuna awoke him and informed him of what had happened. Fortuna stood beside Jabba as he began to talk with Vader, who ordered him to remove the audience so they could talk in private. After Jabba had many of them return in a failed attempt to collect the [[bounty]] on Vader's head, the Sith [[Lord]] threatened him with a [[Force choke]], and the Hutt crime lord acquiesced, having his two best bounty hunters&mdash;[[Boba Fett]] and [[Black Krrsantan]]&mdash;dispatched to fulfill Vader's missions.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref>\n\nThe following day,<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" /> Vader returned to oversee the Empire's official negotiations, accompanied by [[stormtrooper]]s. Although Fortuna tried to greet Vader, the Sith Lord cut off his pleasantries, beginning the ultimately successful negotiations with Jabba.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref> At some point between the Battle of [[Yavin]] and [[Battle of Hoth]], Fortuna contacted the Tatooinian [[mercenary]] [[Saponza]] and [[Saponza's partner|his partner]] in the name of Jabba. The two men had reacted violently to the presence of Jabba's henchmen around [[Saponza's homestead]], killing six of them. Fortuna let the two mercenaries know they had made an enemy of his Hutt master. Some time later, Jabba's henchmen razed Saponza's estate to the ground in retaliation, and the majordomo contacted Saponza once again to gloat over his misfortune and warn him that Jabba's revenge was not over.<ref name=\"Commander\">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref>\n\n====Return of Crimson Dawn====\n{{Quote|All of you want to live.

En route to the Hutt's [[Jabba's Palace|Tatooinian palace]] with his [[bounty]], Fett contacted Fortuna and assured the majordomo that Solo was alive, safely secured within [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] [[carbonite]]. To Fortuna's confusion, however, Fett abruptly ended their communication when the [[carbonite matrix]] containing Solo became unstable, forcing him to take a detour to [[Nar Shaddaa]] to fix the issue. There, Solo was stolen from Fett<ref name=\"WotBH Alpha 1\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha'' 1]]</ref> by agents of [[Crimson Dawn]], a [[The galaxy|galactic]] crime syndicate that had long been considered obsolete.<ref name=\"WotBH 1\">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 1]]</ref> Fett declined to immediately inform Fortuna of his bad luck, instead simply telling the Twi'lek that his delivery would \"be a [[Standard minute|minute]].\" Representing the interests of an increasingly impatient Jabba, Fortuna warned Fett not to disappoint the mighty Hutt lord.<ref name=\"WotBH Alpha 1\" />\n\nSoon after, Crimson Dawn sent invitations to many of the major crime lords in the galaxy, including Jabba. Revealing that they held Solo in their possession, they bid the invitees to travel to [[Jekara]] and witness the return of Crimson Dawn. Believing that Fett had cheated him and sold the smuggler to a competitor, Jabba placed a bounty on the [[Hunting|hunter]]'s head before departing for Jekara, leaving Fortuna to look over his palace. Unaware that the Hutt had left, Fett stormed through the castle's dusty gates, incinerating two [[Gamorrean]] guards and demanding that Fortuna give him answers. After explaining that his master was absent, Fortuna suggested that Fett leave, lest the retinue of thugs and mercenaries that made up Jabba's court turn their weapons on the hunter. Fett reminded the rabble, however, that many of their number would perish in a firefight, and they would die in the name of Bib Fortuna. With this in mind, no one fired a shot.<ref name=\"WotBH 1\" />\n\nAt the behest of Fett, Fortuna showed him Jabba's invitation, which depicted a [[Qi'ra|human woman]] requesting that her audience \"await the Dawn.\" Accepting her as his new target, Fett ordered Fortuna to have his ship, ''[[Slave I]]'', repaired of damage it had sustained on Nar Shaddaa before leaving for Jekara himself.<ref name=\"WotBH 1\" /> Fett was eventually successful in his mission, managing to retrieve the frozen Han Solo and deliver him to Jabba intact.<ref name=\"ROTJ\" />\n\n====Trouble at the Great Pit of Carkoon====\n{{Quote|He's no Jedi.|Bib Fortuna, to Jabba the Hutt, regarding Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\n[[File:BibFortuna_Jabba_Ep6.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fortuna serving alongside Jabba at the palace during the Galactic Civil War.]]\nLater in the war, Fortuna greeted two [[droid]] visitors to his master's palace. The two mechanical units, called [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]], claimed that they had a gift for the Hutt. The majordomo demanded that they hand over that gift to him so he could bring it to Jabba himself, but the droids answered that their instructions were to give it only to the crime lord himself. Fortuna relented, and led the droids into the throne room, where they delivered a [[Hologram|holographic message]] from their owner, the Rebel hero and fledgling [[Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. In the message, Skywalker asked to bargain for the life of his friend Han Solo, offering C-3PO and R2-D2 in exchange.<ref name=\"ROTJ\" />\n\nFortuna was present when [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] arrived under the disguise of notorious bounty hunter [[Boushh]] along with Han Solo's longtime friend [[Chewbacca]], demanding a higher payment for the Wookiee's capture, under the threat of a [[thermal detonator]]. He also witnessed Organa's capture when she attempted to free Solo herself. When Luke Skywalker eventually [[Rescue of Han Solo|arrived]], Fortuna admitted him into the throne room, despite having been given explicit instructions not to do so until after Jabba had finished his [[Sleep|nap]].<ref name=\"ROTJ\" /> Fortuna was influenced by Skywalker's [[mind trick]], though he was not as weak-minded as some of Jabba's other guards.
