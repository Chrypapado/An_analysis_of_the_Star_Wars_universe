Like most wingriders, he was smaller and shorter than a typical Drall. He had [[Color/Legends|tan]] fur, which grew longer on his head, where he braided it into elaborate curls with beads. Elamm felt most comfortable above-ground, unlike most Drall, who stayed underground whenever possible. He [[Police officer/Legends|patrolled]] the skies mounted on his [[ibbot]] named [[Sha'lott]]. He possessed a natural affinity for animals, ibbots especially, and felt more comfortable with them than with his fellow Drall.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Drall]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]"}}}]}}}}
