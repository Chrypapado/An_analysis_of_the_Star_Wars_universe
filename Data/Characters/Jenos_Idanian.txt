It was while using this alias that Han tried to retrieve a large cache of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from the [[Imperial Galactic Bank|Imperial Bank]] in order to finance his transformation into a legitimate data file that was \"free and clear\", and would allow him to enter the Academy. Unfortunately, due to the nature of how Han had acquired the money (by selling off treasures he and [[Bria Tharen]] had stolen from [[Teroenza]] on [[Ylesia/Legends|Ylesia]]), the account was tagged by Inspector [[Hal Horn]] and Han had to make a break for it before he was arrested by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]].\n\nYears later [[Corran Horn]], on the advice of his grandfather [[Rostek Horn]] and not knowing of Han's connection to the dataphantom, used the pseudonym while searching for his wife [[Mirax Terrik Horn|Mirax]]. Rostek provided him with the identification and gave him Idanian's known history of ship theft, including how Hal had been very close to catching him when he disappeared. Rostek also added some new history to the identity, in which Idanian later joined the Rebellion and, after the war, went on to work as a ship broker.\n\nUnder the Idanian guise, Horn infiltrated the [[Invids]] through the [[Khuiumin Survivors]] pirate gang based on [[Courkrus]]. He quickly rose through the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] ranks, eventually being appointed by [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Leonia Tavira|Tavira]] to take over the entire [[Vlarnya]] operation, though this was a role he would not choose to fulfill. Once he had rescued his wife, Corran abandoned the alias.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n\"Jenos Idanian\" is an anagram of [[Indiana Jones]], another character that [[Harrison Ford]] played.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[I, Jedi]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Bounty Hunter Code: From the Files of Boba Fett]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jenos Idanian#legends\n|nl=Jenos Idanian\n|pl=Jenos Idanian\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Idanian, Jenos}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Khuiumin Survivors]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
