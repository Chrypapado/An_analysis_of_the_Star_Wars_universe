He also cared deeply for his son, saying how it was terrible for a parent to outlive his own child, and mused how old his son would have been, if he had still been alive. He saw his son as a good man, so refused to accept that he'd raped [[Sintas Vel]], Fett's wife.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead 1|''Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead'' 1]] {{1st}}\n*[[Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead 3|''Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead'' 3]] {{1stID}}\n*[[Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead 4|''Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead'' 4]]\n\n[[Category:Concord Dawn residents]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
