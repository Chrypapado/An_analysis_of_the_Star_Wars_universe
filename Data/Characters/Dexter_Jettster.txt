Jettster worked as the cook and employed two waitresses, [[Hermione Bagwa]] and her [[WA-7 waitress droid]] partner, [[FLO]].<ref name=\"Diner\">{{Databank|dexs-diner|Dex's Diner|archivedate=20170225081024}}</ref>\n\nIt was shortly before the [[Clone Wars]] that [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] came to Dex's Diner to see if his old friend, Jettster, could identify a poisoned dart. Though few even knew of the planet [[Kamino]], Jettster did from his days as a prospector on [[Subterrel]] and was able to identify the dart as originating from Kamino. Furthermore, he knew of the native inhabitants, the [[Kaminoan]]s, who were [[Cloning|cloners]] of some repute and kept to themselves but were welcoming to those who brought [[credit]]s. Jettster gently chided his old friend Kenobi who as a Jedi should have put more faith in another person's wisdom than the knowledge of the [[Jedi Archives]].<ref name=\"AotC\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Fall of the Republic===\n[[File:Dexs_Diner_WotF.png|thumb|left|250px|Jettster serving food from his diner kitchen.]]\nBefore the [[Clone Wars]], [[Dex's Diner]] was known to have the best [[nerfburger]]s ever, and people from all over [[the galaxy]] traveled to [[Coruscant]] to eat at Dex's. Unfortunately, not all of Jettster's clientele was trustworthy, as [[Gender|he]] was. [[Thief|Thieves]] sometimes stole nearby, so Jettster enlisted the help of his [[Jedi]] friend, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Kenobi and Jettster set up a sting in the diner itself to stop the robberies. When the thief, [[Tri Tellon]], pickpocketed a trinket from Kenobi, Jettster and Kenobi tracked Tri to [[Tri Tellon's home|her hideout]] that she shared with another rogue, [[Magreda]]. Jettster now owed a favor to Kenobi, one that would be paid.<ref name=\"Stop, Thief!\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=1|story=[[Tales from Wild Space: Stop, Thief!]]}}</ref>\n\nIt was right before the Clone Wars began that Jettster was approached by Kenobi, who wanted to know if Jettster could identify a [[Kamino saberdart|poison dart]]. Jettster was able to identify the dart, which was from the [[planet]] [[Kamino]]. Jettster and Kenobi exchanged friendly banter, and then Kenobi left the diner.<ref name=\"AotC\" />\n\n===Imperial Era===\n{{Quote|He's sending a ship to collect my new pal along with my surveillance data, then taking everything before the Senate Council of Labour Abuses.|Dexter Jettster writes about the council in the ''Smuggler's Guide''|Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide}}\nDuring the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], Dexter looked through a box of reading material on the [[planet]] [[Pashvi]]. Jettster purchased the book that would become known as the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'' previously owned by [[Reginald Danfillo]] from the box for fifty [[credit]]s, which had been tucked between ''[[The Biography of Master Thief Makuta]]'' and ''[[The Field Guide to Trammic Reptavians]]'', because he saw [[Maz Kanata]]'s name on the first page.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" />\n\n[[File:Dex on Athus Klee.png|right|thumb|250px|Dexter Jettster on Athus Klee.]]\nAfter hearing rumours of illegal [[Cybernetics|cyborg mods]] and bodies grown to fit buyer specifications in the stellar skirt of the [[Tingel Arm]], Jettster arrived on [[Athus Klee]] in a [[star-streamer]] to investigate. After the [[starship]] made port in the morning, most passengers poured out quickly and headed directly into the [[Spacers' District]], and by the [[time]] the older Jettster had made it off the vessel every inn had been fully booked out. Jettster instead headed out of the district into the [[Plant|underbrush]] and found a relatively dry rise then lay down under the [[star]]s. He discovered the [[Crimson Dawn]] was advertising for workers to [[Mining|mine]] [[ore]] in their [[Crimson Dawn ore hub|ore hub]].<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" />\n\n[[File:UnidentifiedMiner.png|thumb|left|150px|Jettster rescued a Rodian worker from the ore hub.]]\nAfter six [[Standard day|days]] of hacking through the [[jungle]] with a [[vibro-machete]], Jettster had received bites from two vipers and countless gnats, but managed to find the ore hub. Sneaking around the hub's processing plant, the Besalisk spotted the chop shop and took a number of scans of the workers with his [[macrobinoculars]]. He then rescued a single [[Rodian]] [[Unidentified Rodian cyborg|worker]] from the hub and the pair headed back toward the [[spaceport]].<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" />\n\nEn route, the pair spent [[Standard hour|hours]] one night starring up at the stars through the jungle canopy. Upon reaching the port, Jettster contacted a [[Unidentified politician (Dexter Jettster)|politician]] on the galactic [[capital]], [[Coruscant]], who he was friends with and informed him of the hub. The politician sent a ship to pick up the Rodian and Jettster's surveillance scans so that they could be taken before the [[Imperial Senate]] [[Council of Labor Abuses]]. Jettster wrote about his experiences on Athus Klee throughout his journey, with Evazan and the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] annotating the pages with their own comments when the book later fell into their possession.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" />\n\nWhile still on Athus Klee, Jettster then visited the [[Rasher's Rest]] [[cantina]], where he met the [[Big game hunter|hunter]] [[Tyro Viveca]] and left his possessions unattended while visiting the [[Refresher|latrine]]. Viveca took the opportunity to [[Thief|steal]] the [[book]] that would become known as the ''Smuggler's Guide'' from Jettster and then left Athus Klee for the [[planet]] [[Kashyyyk]].<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" />\n\nBy [[4 ABY]],<ref name=\"Year\">According to ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'', [[Temmin Wexley]] and [[Norra Wexley]] were reunited on [[Akiva]] 30 years before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]].\" Since ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the Hosnian Cataclysm to [[34 ABY]], their reunion in ''Aftermath'' took place in [[4 ABY]].</ref> Dex's Diner was defunct.<ref name=\"Aftermath\">[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJettster was 1.88 [[meter]]s tall, with a [[Color|brown]]-black mustache, yellow [[eye]]s, and tan-brown skin.<ref name=\"Dexter\" /> Jettseter was a very friendly individual who greeted his friend Kenobi with a hug.
