When they met each other they realized that their visions and dreams matched. Their visions and dreams involved [[Masked Soldiers]] invading the planet.<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" /> They also had dreams and visions of their destruction through an explosive device that could wipe out a planet,<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" /> hinting at the coming [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]].{{Fact}} Together, the two developed a system of isolationism in an attempt to thwart the invasion, but the [[Keganite]]s eventually rejected their leaders upon learning of the brainwashing children underwent at the [[Re-Learning Circle]].<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\n==History==\nV-Tan and O-Vieve set up an isolationist government that controlled the people rigorously. They were more-or-less dictators on an officially-democratic planet [[Kegan]], allowing votes but controlling the subject of the vote. Furthermore, [[autohopper]]s, automatically controlled [[Skyhopper/Legends|skyhoppers]], were used to monitor the people, their movements, and their conversations. To encourage the isolated behavior, the pair developed a curriculum known as [[The Learning]] around [[59 BBY]]. This school of thought emphasized sacrificing one's own desires in favor of contributing to the [[General Good]]. A school known as the [[Learning Circle]] was set up outside the city to teach kids from the ages of four to sixteen. Furthermore, a secret [[Re-Learning Circle]] was created within the [[Learning Circle]] to brainwash people to believe as V-Tan and O-Vieve did if they became undisciplined or were considered too physically ill to contribute to society. While Keganites under O-Vieve's rule enjoyed a mostly peaceful society where all of their basic needs were met, the isolationist policy restricted the people from benefiting from advances throughout the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] in medicine, technology, and other fields.<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\nThe two guides lived in the [[Central Dwelling]], part of the [[Gathering Circle]] at the center of the city of Kegan.<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\n==Downfall==\n{{Quote|I still don't understand how an entire planet could place its trust so blindly in visions and dreams.''\"<br />\"''We do not know if O-Vieve's visions were wrong, Padawan. O-Vieve's vision of the future was clouded, but that doesn't make it invalid.''\"<br />\"''That I don't believe. I can't imagine one central evil controlling the whole galaxy. That would be impossible.''\"<br />\"''I hope we do not see it, Obi-Wan. But we cannot say it is impossible. Haven't you experienced enough of chance and evil in the galaxy to realize that?''\"<br />\"''She saw darkness coming from the Jedi itself.

The [[Master]]s, while searching for Force-sensitive [[Olana Chion|O-Lana]] and their Padawans, who had also been captured by a [[Truant Guide]], disrupted the system of skyhoppers that closely monitored the populace and helped rescue their [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] from the secure school. After they escaped, they exposed V-Tan and O-Vieve for their totalitarian ways, and the two rulers (viewed by the populace as overprotective, at best; tyrannical, at worst) were voted down from their posts as the \"Benevolent Guides\" of Kegan. The Force-sensitive child, the only daughter of V-Nen and O-Melie, was removed by the Jedi team to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to be [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] at the [[Jedi Temple]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{1stID|Vieve}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=O-Vieve\n|es=O-Vieve\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Keganites]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
