They began selling recordings of Tarasin music to tourists, and business soon took off, because the recordings gained popularity among members of aquatic [[Species/Legends|species]]. However, in c. [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], the [[Cularin system]]'s [[Senator/Legends|senator]], [[Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren|Lavina Wren]] announced that she was getting engaged, and the S&N Music distribution center was subsequently graffitied with a statement that was hostile to the wedding. The graffiti angered Slice and Nivel, and they began cleaning it off.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[An Official Engagement]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]"}}}]}}}}
