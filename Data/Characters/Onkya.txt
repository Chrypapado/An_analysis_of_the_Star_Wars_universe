The clan was stationed a the [[Bogden Jedi chapter house|Jedi chapter house]] on [[Bogden 3]]. They were awaiting transport back to the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]], which had been delayed due to the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|battle]] there. When masters K'Kruhk and [[Sian Jeisel]] arrived with their clone troopers, [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] was issued. Several of the younglings were [[Massacre on Bogden 3|killed]] as [[Du Mahn]] defended them. K'Kruhk and Piru ultimately escaped with nine younglings to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, Onkya was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk.\n\n===Great Jedi Purge===\nOnkya was present when [[Lumbra]] and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that the broken ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, fellow youngling, [[Seddwia]], jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi younglings, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]].\n\nThe younglings were freed by K'Kruhk who gave in to un-Jedi like behavior briefly. With the help of Chase Piru, he shot down Lumbra's men with arrows. Lumbra and his shipmate, Callow, died at the hands of K'Kruhk's lightsaber.\n\n===Arkinnea===\nOnkya and the rest of the Soaring Hawkbat Clan relocated to [[Arkinnea]]. He was placed into a refugee camp to await resettlement in the open lands. He watched as K'Kruhk broke up a fight between two other refugees. He listened to [[Unidentified female refugee|a refugee]] as she talked to Piru about the situation in the camp. Later that night, he was in the tent when [[Jedi Master|Master]] [[Zao]] was making a [[Soup/Legends|soup]] for dinner. Onkya eagerly accepted a bowl of soup. After dinner, he observed Zao as he taught the younglings their lesson for the day. The Jedi Master tossed three spice berries in the air, catching two and eating one. Onkya correctly answered that Zao ate the green spice berry.<ref name=\"DT1\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 1]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:ZaoOnkyaSoup.jpg|thumb|right|Zao gives Onkya a bowl of soup.]]\nDue to Zao's feeling that there was danger in the camp, Onkya and the other younglings fled the camp under the cover of darkness with the Jedi masters. Once they were out in the countryside, Onkya helped the other younglings pick fruit. The clan proceeded to get further away from the refugee camp in a [[Repulsorcart/Legends|repulsorcart]] that K'Kruhk stole and Onkya took a nap in the back. Later, he was with the rest of the clan as they raced Piru up a mountain path. As they got to the top, Onkya saw the shattered remains of a large group of refugees.<ref name=\"DT2\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 2]]''</ref> Realizing that some of the dead refugees were from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], Onkya questioned why the [[Arkinnea Militia]] would kill them. Shortly afterwords, Onkya and the others saw an Arkinnea ore carrier fly overhead and drop its load of refugees. When the militia spotted the clan, Onkya and the rest of the younglings were put into the repulsorcart and pushed down the mountain towards the forest. The vehicle crashed into a tree when it reached the forest, and Onkya was thrown clear.<ref name=\"DT3\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 3]]''</ref> He fled deeper into the forest with the rest of the clan. He was present when they were confronted by a group of [[Yunu]].<ref name=\"DT4\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 4]]''</ref>\n\nWhen the soldiers began firing, Zao used a boulder to block their fire while directing Onkya and the rest of the clan to run. The padawan ran a short distance, but returned with the rest of the clan when they heard the firing stop. Onkya accompanied the Yunu to [[Hidden Temple (Arkinnea)|a safe location]]. He greeted K'Kruhk when the Jedi Master finally caught up with the rest of the clan. Onkya settled down and continued his training in the ways of the Jedi.<ref name=\"DT5\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dark Times: Parallels]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 1]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 2]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 3]]'' {{1stID}}\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 4]]''\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bogden residents]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Mon Calamari]]\n[[Category:Soaring Hawkbat Clan]]"}}}]}}}}
