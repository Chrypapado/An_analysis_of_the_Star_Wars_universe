Roa often taught his skills to neophyte smugglers, among whom was [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. Roa took Han on his first ever [[Kessel Run/Legends|Kessel Run]], and his first visit to [[Smuggler's Run/Legends|Smuggler's Run]].\n\nFor years, Roa courted a [[Gender/Legends|woman]] named [[Lwyll]] and proposed [[Marriage/Legends|marriage]] numerous times, but she always refused unless he retired from smuggling. Their unique relationship was well-known among the [[Corellian sector/Legends|Corellian sector]], and everyone knew they were in love. Just prior to the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (3 BBY)|Battle of Nar Shaddaa]], Roa proposed again on the condition he retire from smuggling, and Lwyll accepted. However, Roa answered the call to arms against the impending [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] attack.\n\nRoa flew as a scout in his custom [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]], which he named the [[Lwyll (Redthorn-class)|''Lwyll'']], after his fianc\u00e9e. Upon first sighting the Imperial strike force, Roa nearly panicked and froze, but snapped out of his daze quickly. Racing back to Nar Shaddaa, Roa's ship sustained heavy damage and he barely avoided a crash landing. Even so, he narrowly escaped his burning ship before it exploded. With the conclusion of the battle, Roa settled down with Lwyll.\n\nWhile visiting the [[Corporate Sector/Legends|Corporate Sector]], Han met Roa and Lwyll again, who had left Nar Shaddaa.\n\nMany years later, Han would meet Roa again &ndash; during the early months of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. While wandering through his old haunts after the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], Han encountered Roa, who was actively seeking revenge against the invaders because Lwyll had been killed by them. Through the experiences shared by Han and Roa during this time, Han was able to find the strength he needed to return to his family and avenge Chewbacca.\n\nRoa was captured by the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] along with [[Fasgo]] at the [[Battle of Ord Mantell (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Ord Mantell]] and taken as a [[yammosk]]-tending [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] aboard the [[Cr\u00e8che (clustership)|''Cr\u00e8che'']]. He was later rescued by Han Solo.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]''\n*''[[Rebel Dawn]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Han Solo's Revenge]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe]]''\n*''[[Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Heroes & Rogues]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|In Chewbacca and Han Solo entries}}\n*''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Han|archivedate=20110903234809}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Roa\n|es=Roa\n|nl=Roa\n}}\n\n[[Category:Businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
