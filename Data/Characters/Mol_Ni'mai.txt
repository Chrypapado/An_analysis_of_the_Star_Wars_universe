You haven't! I know far more than you ever will, but still there are a few lessons I could teach you.|Mol Ni'mai|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Mol Ni'mai''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] master [[armorsmith]] who designed the [[Reinforced Insulated Sheath armor]]. He lived in a [[Mol Ni'mai's hut|hut]] in the northern [[Mountain/Legends|mountains]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. He was visited by a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] and fellow armorsmith during this [[Time/Legends|time]] who wished to learn the secret of crafting the R.I.S. [[Armor/Legends|armor]]. After a payment of 50,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], Ni'mai instructed the spacer on the basics of the armor's construction. Once Ni'mai was satisfied that the spacer had learned the essentials and had seen the spacer's armorsmithing prowess first hand, he gave the spacer schematics for each piece of the R.I.S. armor.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Let's get started. I'm going to teach you how to construct my masterpiece invention: R.I.S. armor. This armor has no equal in battle. Everything else is junk compared to this!|Mol Ni'mai|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA [[brown]]-furred [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]], Mol Ni'mai was a master [[armorsmith]] and designer of the [[Reinforced Insulated Sheath armor]]. He lived alone in a [[Mol Ni'mai's hut|small hut]] in the northern [[Mountain/Legends|mountains]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. He was visited by a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] and fellow armorsmith during this [[Time/Legends|time]] who wished to learn how to construct the R.I.S. [[Armor/Legends|armor]]. Ni'mai demanded 50,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] from the spacer before he would even begin instructing. The spacer paid the fee, and Ni'mai began by instructing the spacer in the creation of the armor segment, which provided the armor its protection. The armor segment required [[Bone/Legends|bones]] from a [[Woolamander/Legends|woolamander]] harrower for strength, the hide of a [[gurk]] [[King/Legends|king]] for flexibility, and for inner protection and warmth, the scales of a great dune [[kimogila]]. The armor's appearance layer was next, requiring the feathers of a [[Peko-peko/Legends|peko-peko]] albatross. Once Ni'mai was satisfied that his student had learned the basics of the armor's construction, he told the spacer to craft a complete pair of the R.I.S. [[Boot/Legends|boots]], which the spacer was successful in doing. Ni'mai considered the boots adequate and rewarded his student with the schematics for the remainder of the R.I.S. armor pieces.<ref name=\"SWG:P4\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Let's see how you did&hellip; Bah! Look at these mounting tabs! They aren't even on straight! The flexor matrix has the plasticity of carbonite!|Mol Ni'mai|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nMol Ni'mai was a very arrogant man, believing himself to be the greatest master armorsmith in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and refusing to even speak more than a few sentences to those of lesser comprehension in the art of armor crafting. When he did find someone he considered teaching, he was very condescending to his pupil and critical of his or her work. He demanded strict obedience from his students. Ni'mai declared that R.I.S. armor was his masterpiece invention and that all other armors were junk in comparison.<ref name=\"SWG:P4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nMol Ni'mai was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:P4\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Mol Ni'mai was added to the game with the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 4 Notes: 13 November 03|Publish 4]]\", released on [[November 13]], 2003.<ref>{{SonyCite|url=recent_updates.jsp?o=60891|text=Publish 4 Mounts and Cities|archivedate=20040219034708}}</ref> Mol Ni'mai initiated a quest that taught the player, playing as a spacer, to create the Reinforced Insulated Sheath armor.
