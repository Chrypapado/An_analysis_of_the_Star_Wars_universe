But now that you've killed some of them, they won't stop until you've defeated their leader. You must find him and kill him, too.|Jon to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Jon''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Farm/Legends|farmer]] who lived on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] near the [[Jedi Enclave]] with his daughter, [[Ilsa]], during the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before the [[Jedi Civil War]]. Ilsa was [[Death/Legends|killed]] by a group of [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorians]] in [[3956 BBY]] due to her defiance against their assumed authority. In his rage, Jon demanded that the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] of Dantooine deliver justice, but this was denied as it was considered by the Jedi that he was only seeking revenge. Inadvertently, that justice was delivered by the former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who struck down the Mandalorians in self defense during his trials to become [[Zhar Lestin]]'s [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]]. Appeased, Jon returned to his farm, and resumed work.\n\n==Biography==\n===The murder of Ilsa===\n{{Quote|They came to our land, demanding our livelihood. But Ilsa, my Ilsa, said no&hellip;|Jon|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nJon was a well-known [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Farm/Legends|farmer]] who lived near the [[Jedi Enclave]] and the future [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Khoonda]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] during the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before and in the [[Jedi Civil War]]. At some stage in his early career as a farmer, he sired a [[Daughter/Legends|daughter]], [[Ilsa]]. Jon was always concerned for Ilsa, as she was often given to being compulsive, and there was always the threat of the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] raiders who plagued the fields of Dantooine, looting farms at random, and leaving people with barely enough food and money to survive. Sometimes, they were known to go even further, [[Death/Legends|killing]] farmers on a whim. Their intent was to take over the complete infrastructure of the farms surrounding the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Enclave, and they were loath to stop at robbery and pillage.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nThe Jedi, who were the only form of law on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], did next to nothing to stop the Mandalorians, due to the fact that they were dealing with the pressing issue of the [[Jedi Civil War]]. This led some farmers to defend themselves, which in turn escalated the problem. One day, when Jon was tending the fields with Ilsa, a group of Mandalorian raiders, led by the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]-toting [[Sherruk]], arrived at Jon's farm. Instead of sacking his establishment immediately, they demanded that Ilsa hand over anything of value. When she defied them, they murdered her before Jon's [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Enraged, but helpless, Jon was left with the corpse of Ilsa as the Mandalorians fled the scene.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n===Lobbying to the Jedi Knights===\n{{Quote|How long can you people continue to sit by and claim you protect us? Protectors? Ha! You sit in your Enclave safe from the Mandalorians while we suffer!|Jon|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Jonfarmer1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jon waits outside the Enclave for help.]]\nOutraged and grief-stricken, Jon demanded justice from the Jedi. He ordered that they hunt down the Mandalorians and destroy them, not only to avenge the death of Ilsa, but so that the farmers of Dantooine could live in peace, and without fear of constant attack and destruction. But the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|Dantooine Council]] believed that Jon only sought revenge and so did not grant him audience.<ref name=\"kotor\" /> In addition, they were chiefly concerned with the ongoing Jedi Civil War.<ref name=\"cswe\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> Fuming, Jon spent most of his [[Time/Legends|time]] outside the Jedi Enclave, asking any Jedi who would walk by for help. However, like the Council, none of the Jedi obliged.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nJon also sought help through other channels. He informed all of his fellow farmers of his plight, but even they did not help him in his quest. Instead, they gave him vocal support, and were quick to cite to strangers the case of Ilsa's murder. While, as Jon pointed out, the death of Ilsa could have been a springboard for a unified resistance against the Mandalorian raiders, the opportunity was wasted.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n===Meeting Revan===\n{{Quote|I've come here to ask you, please, master Jedi, stop these raiders and get revenge for my daughter.|Jon|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:Wideangledjon.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Jon the farmer at the time of his meeting Revan.]]\nOne day, Jon met [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], an amnesiac former [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] who sought to re-commence [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]]. Revan had made himself known on Dantooine, under his new alias, and so Jon naturally requested that the newcomer help him. While Revan did not initially rebuke Jon, he was not one for wanton violence, and so continued on his set tasks. Inadvertently, Revan was forced to kill several Mandalorians in combat, due to their ambushing him on the fields around the Enclave. Returning to Jon with the news, Revan inquired deeper into the situation.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nJon told him that the carnage would not stop until the ringleader, Sherruk, had been killed. Despite Revan's constant avoidance of the lure of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], he set out after Sherruk, with the justification that he would be helping the farmers. On the [[Grass/Legends|grassy]] plains of Dantooine, he [[Confrontation on Dantooine|confronted]] Sherruk, and urged him to refrain from his actions. When Sherruk refused, Revan killed him and his cronies in combat. Revan returned to Jon with the news, which calmed the volatile farmer down. Jon insisted that Revan take his reward of 1000 Republic [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], and, satisfied, Jon returned to his farm, a broken man.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I will give you all I have, just please, annihilate them from the face of this planet!|Jon|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\nJon was a light skinned Human male with black hair and blue eyes. Following the murder of his daughter, Jon turned to violence, demanding the guilty parties be killed. Other farmers in the Enclave community did not act surprised at Jon's attitude towards the Jedi Council and the Jedi in general following the murder, and they were hesitant in joining any resistance movement that he might form.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nJon himself avoided creating a resistance movement, as he had a complete lack of faith in his combat abilities. However, Jon lusted for the [[Blood/Legends|blood]] of the Mandalorians. He demanded their destruction, and even requested that their [[Heart/Legends|hearts]] literally be torn from their bodies.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nJon would not accept the decisions of his peers nor the Jedi, and would constantly demand justice, despite Dantooine not having a fully fledged legal system. When the Mandalorian leader, Sherruk, was killed, Jon suddenly became docile, no longer abrasive and bloodthirsty.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJon first appeared in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' from [[BioWare]], and was created by [[David Falkner]], [[Steve Gilmour]], [[Casey Hudson]], [[Drew Karpyshyn]], [[James Ohlen]], [[Preston Watamaniuk]], and [[Derek Watts]]. He is the instigator of one of Revan's optional side quests in the game. ''Knights of the Old Republic'' is the only source in which Jon appears,<ref name=\"kotor\" /> but he has been mentioned in the game's [[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|strategy guide]]<ref name=\"strategy guide\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''</ref> and in [[2008]]'s ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.<ref name=\"cswe\" />\n\n===Alternate resolutions===\nIf Revan is attuned to the dark side, he will oblige Jon and hunt down the Mandalorians. The player, as Revan, can also demand more money from Jon or refuse his offer, but he will still give the player 1000 credits. It is also possible to ignore Jon completely, although interaction with him is required for 100% completion of the game.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Jon}}\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Jon\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Farmers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
