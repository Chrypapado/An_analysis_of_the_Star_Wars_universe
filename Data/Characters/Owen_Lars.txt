Fearing that his nephew could have been attacked by Tusken Raiders, Lars scolded him and then argued with Beru, stating he would keep the boy occupied with more chores.

Then, to Beru and Skywalker's surprise, Lars revealed he planned to show him how to use a [[blaster]] rifle.

During the drought, [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] of Tatooine, declared a [[water tax]], and he had his enforcers take the farmers' harvests, sometimes by force. However, unknown to Lars, Kenobi was protecting the Lars homestead from Jabba's thugs, so the family was never forced to pay. Still, the drought continued to worsen, and one night, Skywalker left the moisture farm to steal water from the Hutt's thugs. When Lars and Beru realized that Skywalker was missing, they searched for the boy, but they were unable to find him. Kenobi, however, sensed that Skywalker was in danger, and the Jedi found and rescued the boy, bringing him back to the homestead. In the morning, Beru found Skywalker, and called for her husband. Lars rushed to Skywalker's side, asking if he was all right. Skywalker, was unharmed, but he was unable to recall any of the previous night's events. About a [[Standard week|week]] later, the drought lifted, and the [[moisture vaporator]]s began collecting water again.<ref name=\"Star Wars 7\">[[Star Wars (2015) 7|''Star Wars'' (2015) 7]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Owen_confronts_Kenobi.png|thumb|left|300px|Fearing that Kenobi will lead to Skywalker's death, Lars tells the Jedi to stay away from the boy.]]\nA year after the Great Drought's end, Skywalker took interest in [[pilot]]ing his family's [[T-16 skyhopper]], and during one adventurous flight, Skywalker became overconfident in his abilities, wrecking the skyhopper in [[Beggar's Canyon]]. Lars grounded Skywalker, enraged that they were short a speeder and could not afford repairs. When Skywalker suggested entering a race at Anchorhead and using prize money, Lars rejected the idea, telling Skywalker that he would never fly again. In the following days, Lars and Skywalker went to a market to purchase an [[astromech droid]] and a [[droid]] capable of speaking [[Bocce]]. While Lars was looking at droids, Skywalker was approached by two [[Jawa]]s, who handed him a box filled with the parts needed to repair the skyhopper. Skywalker believed it was a gift from his uncle, and the boy thanked him and rushed off; in actuality, the parts were from Kenobi, who believed that Skywalker needed more practice piloting. However, Lars immediately realized that Kenobi had interfered, also recalling the unusual absence of Tusken Raiders and Hutt thugs at the homestead. Furious, Lars visited [[Ben Kenobi's home|Kenobi's home]], bringing the skyhopper parts with him. Reasserting that he did not want Kenobi's help, Lars told the hermit to leave Skywalker alone, saying it was his own job to protect Skywalker, and that the Jedi was whom Skywalker needed protection from.<ref name=\"Star Wars 15\" />\n\nSoon after, Lars purchased skyhoppper parts at [[Tosche Station]], hoping to fix the speeder with Skywalker and amend their strained relationship. However, when Lars returned home, the farmer was attacked by [[Black Krrsantan]], a [[Wookiee]] [[bounty hunter]] searching for the man who had defied Jabba's tax collectors the year before. Krrsantan took Lars to a clifftop near the [[Dune Sea]], where the Wookiee [[Stuncuffs|cuffed]] and beat the farmer with an electric baton, hoping to elicit a scream. Lars begged Krrsantan to stop, saying that he could not understand the [[Shyriiwook|Wookiee's language]] and was unable to answer his questions. The bounty hunter continued to attack until Kenobi appeared atop the cliff, revealing himself to be the man marked for [[bounty]]. Krrsantan immediately attacked Kenobi, quickly snaring the Jedi in a [[stun net]]. While Krrsantan's back was turned, Lars charged, but the Wookiee knocked him back, sending the farmer over the cliff edge. Lars caught himself on a protrusion from the cliff, hanging on as Kenobi summoned [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's third lightsaber|his lightsaber]], cutting the net and reengaging the Wookiee. Kenobi knocked the Wookiee over with [[the Force]] and turned his attention to rescuing Lars.<ref name=\"Star Wars 20\">[[Star Wars (2015) 20|''Star Wars'' (2015) 20]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Owen-and-Luke.png|thumb|right|300px|Safe from the bounty hunter, Lars is reunited with Skywalker.]]\nHowever, Krrsantan quickly stood back up, grabbing a boulder and preparing to kill his target. Kenobi sliced the boulder in half, but one chunk fell and broke the rock which had been supporting Lars. The farmer began to fall, but he was saved by Kenobi, who held him through the Force. Kenobi struggled to concentrate on holding Lars and fending off the Wookiee, and the Jedi lost his grip on the farmer, who began to plummet toward the ground. As Lars fell, however, Skywalker&mdash;who had repaired the skyhopper and went in search of his captured uncle&mdash;arrived, catching him on one of the skyhopper's [[cannon]]s. Skywalker landed the skyhopper and apologized, and Lars embraced his nephew, looking up to see Kenobi standing victorious on the clifftop. After the event, Lars and Kenobi never spoke, and they both happily returned to their homes.<ref name=\"Star Wars 20\" />\n\nYears later, when Skywalker was twelve years old,<ref name=\"Complete Visual New\">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref> Beru compared Skywalker to his father after Lars noted he was proud of his nephew's hard work. Refusing to discuss Anakin any further, Lars told Beru that his nephew was like a son to him. Not wanting Skywalker to experience war in his lifetime, he admitted he would not let him join the Imperial Academy. Later that day, Skywalker and his friend [[Windy]] got lost in a [[sandstorm]] and encountered a [[krayt dragon]].<ref name=\"An Old Friend\" /> The two boys were saved by Kenobi, who took them back home. Lars thanked Kenobi for bringing Skywalker back safely, but again told the Jedi to stay away from the boy. In return, Kenobi revealed he had been observing Skywalker, informing Lars that the Force was strong in him and that he would leave the farm one day. Lars responded by saying that the Jedi went extinct with the [[Galactic Republic]], warning Kenobi to never visit the homestead again.<ref name=\"Meeting the Droids\">[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|''Star Wars'' LINE Webtoon]]: Chapter 2&mdash;\"Meeting the Droids\"</ref>\n\n===Final days===\n{{Quote|You know, I think that R2 unit we bought may have been stolen.''\"<br />\"''What makes you think that?''\"<br />\"''Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.

Lars, requiring an astromech droid and a droid capable of programming moisture vaporators, settled on purchasing the astromech droid [[R5-D4]] and the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], respectively. With the droids selected, Lars told Skywalker to clean them, despite the boy's plans of going to Tosche Station with his friends. However, Skywalker discovered that the [[R5 series astromech droid|R5 unit]] had a bad [[motivator]], and he informed his uncle. At the suggestion of C-3PO, Lars bought the astromech droid [[R2-D2]] in place of R5-D4.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nLater, while Skywalker was cleaning R2-D2, he discovered a [[Hologram|holographic]] message for \"Obi-Wan Kenobi.\" Wondering if the droid was referring to Ben Kenobi, Skywalker asked his uncle during dinner. Lars replied that Kenobi was just a crazy old wizard, telling Skywalker to take the droid to Anchorhead and have its memory [[Memory wipe|erased]]. When Skywalker asked about the possibility of \"Obi-Wan\" coming to look for the droid, Lars denied the thought, telling Skywalker that the man had died around the same time as his father. The mention of his father piqued Skywalker's interest, and he asked if the man had known his father. Lars told Skywalker to forget it, telling his nephew to take care of the droids by morning. Thinking the droids would provide extra help on the farm, Skywalker, who desired to enroll in the [[Imperial Academy]] like his friends, asked Lars if he could join that year. Fearing that Skywalker was too much like his father, Lars denied his nephew's wish, stating that his help was still needed and that he could enroll in the following year.

In the film's second draft, titled ''[[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars]]'', Lars and Beru were rewritten to be the guardians of [[twin]]s [[Biggs Darklighter|Biggs]] and [[Windy|Windy Starkiller]], and it was in this draft that Lars and Beru became the uncle and aunt of Luke Skywalker. In the second draft, Lars was also a Jedi, and it was not until the third draft, ''[[The Star Wars: From The Adventures of Luke Starkiller]]'', that Lars became a farmer.<ref name=\"Making of Star Wars\">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref> Lars' origins as an anthropologist were a self-reference by Lucas, who had intended to study anthropology at [[Wikipedia:San Francisco State University|San Francisco State University]] before he switched to cinematography.<ref name=\"Cinema of George Lucas\">''[[The Cinema of George Lucas]]''</ref> Later, the screenplay for [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']] also revealed that Lars and Ben Kenobi were brothers, although the idea was removed from the script's final cut.<ref name=\"Essential Reader's Companion\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[2002]], a younger Lars, portrayed by [[Joel Edgerton]], appeared in the film [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']], the second installment of the ''Star Wars'' [[prequel trilogy]]. [[Canon]]ically, ''Attack of the Clones'' is the first time Lars' name is mentioned in full.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /> In [[2005]], Edgerton returned to the role for [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], the prequel trilogy's conclusion,.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> In [[2014]], Edgerton also expressed enthusiasm in reprising the role for a rumored Obi-Wan Kenobi [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Anthology'' film]].<ref name=\"Superhero Hype\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/317941-exclusive-joel-edgerton-wants-to-reprise-uncle-owen-in-star-wars|title=Exclusive: Joel Edgerton Wants to Reprise Uncle Owen in Star Wars|author=Evry, Max|date=2014-10-09|work=[http://www.superherohype.com Superhero Hype!]|archivedate=20181002001202}}</ref> Other than Brown and Edgerton, Lars has been portrayed by [[Charles Howerton]], who voiced the character in the young readers book ''[[Episode IV: A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD]]'',<ref name=\"New Hope Read-Along\">''[[Episode IV: A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''</ref> and [[Michael Donovan]], who voiced Lars in \"[[Mission to Mos Eisley (episode)|Mission to Mos Eisley]], an episode of the non-canon television show ''[[LEGO Star Wars: Droid Tales]]''.<ref name=\"Droid Tales\">{{Droid Tales|Mission to Mos Eisley (episode)|Mission to Mos Eisley}}</ref>\n\nWhile shooting Episode II in [[Wikipedia:Tunisia|Tunisia]], Edgerton filmed a scene for Episode III in which he is delivered the infant Luke by Obi-Wan, played by a stand-in actor rather than [[Ewan McGregor]], as Lucas didn't desire to return to Tunisia for that single shot years later. However, the scene was changed during the Episode III shoot in September [[2003]], where McGregor playing Kenobi was filmed handing baby Luke to [[Bonnie Maree Piesse]] playing Beru, this time with Owen being played by an stand-in as Lucas \"felt it would be better if Luke were handed over to a woman\".
