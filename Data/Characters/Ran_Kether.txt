We lost him at Kalarba.|Viqi Shesh, masquerading as Welda Kether|The New Jedi Order: Star by Star}}\nIn [[25 ABY/Legends|25 ABY]], the New Republic was invaded by a race of extragalactic [[Alien/Legends|aliens]] known as the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], who sought to conquer the galaxy and claim it as their new home.<ref name=\"vp\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]</ref> The Yuuzhan Vong made rapid progress, dealing defeat after defeat to the New Republic. The [[Senate Select Committee for Refugees]] was created to deal with the flood of displaced persons engendered by the [[Yuuzhan Vong War|war]] and Kether joined the service as a pilot for refugee [[Transport/Legends|transports]].<ref name=\"sbs\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref> When the Yuuzhan Vong moved on [[Kalarba/Legends|Kalarba]], a [[Mid Rim]] world, Kether participated in the evacuation of the planet.<ref name=\"cswe\" />\n\nThe Yuuzhan Vong began their [[Battle of Kalarba|offensive]] by depositing a [[dovin basal]]&mdash;a creature capable of manipulating gravity&mdash;on the surface of Kalarba. The dovin basal subsequently focused a powerful gravitic pull on [[Hosk Station/Legends|Hosk Station]], an artificial space station built into Kalarba's [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Hosk]], and began dragging the moon down toward the planet. The evacuation of both Kalarba and Hosk Station that ensued was further complicated by the arrival of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet.<ref name=\"bp\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]''</ref> Flying SELCORE refugee transports in the evacuation effort, Kether was killed during the battle.<ref name=\"sbs\" /><ref name=\"cswe\" /> Ultimately, only a few thousand of the Kalarba system's inhabitants were evacuated in time.<ref name=\"njosb\">''[[The New Jedi Order Sourcebook]]''</ref>\n\nKether's role in the Yuuzhan Vong War was not yet finished, despite the pilot's death. In [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]], [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Viqi Shesh]] of [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]], who had collaborated with the Yuuzhan Vong throughout the early years of the invasion, was discovered as a traitor to the New Republic. The former senator fled into the underlevels of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]]. Determined to kidnap [[Ben Skywalker]], the son of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], as a prize for her Yuuzhan Vong masters, Shesh adopted the persona of \"[[Welda Kether]]\" as a way to ingratiate herself with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han]] and [[Leia Organa Solo]], who were acting as the child's guardians on Coruscant.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\nWelda Kether, according to Shesh's story, had been Ran's girlfriend back in the days of the war against the Galactic Empire and had met Han Solo twice, on Ran's homeworld of Chandrila. Shesh planned to use the story as a way to earn Solo's trust before kidnapping the infant Ben Skywalker. To lend credence to the scheme, Shesh located a young boy, [[Dab Hantaq]], and bribed him to act as [[Tarc Kether|Tarc]], who was Ran's son in the deception. Although the primary stage of Shesh's plan worked, in that she was able to convince the Solos that she had known Ran Kether and secure passage on the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]&mdash;the personal starship of the Solos&mdash;during the chaotic evacuation of Coruscant, Shesh was foiled in her plot to abduct Ben Skywalker.<ref name=\"sbs\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKether was not mentioned again until the ninth installment in [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|The New Jedi Order]] series of novels, ''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''. In ''Star by Star'', Kether is mentioned as having died during the evacuation of Kalarba, an event depicted in ''[[The New Jedi Order: Balance Point]]'', an earlier novel in the series. The only source for Kether's death, however, is Viqi Shesh, who is in the process of deceiving the Solos. The pilot's demise at Kalarba was only verified in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', published in [[2008]].\n\nWhether or not Welda and Tarc Kether actually existed and had their identities stolen by Shesh and Hantaq is unclear. While Han Solo does not claim to remember \"Welda Kether\" from their time on Chandrila, the fact that Kether's death and previous acquaintance with Solo were known to Shesh could suggest that Welda and Tarc Kether did exist and that the former senator had gone far enough as to appropriate their identities. This article assumes, however, that Welda and Tarc Kether were concoctions of Shesh and that Kether had no wife or child at the time of his death.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box|\n|title=[[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]]\n|years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7.5 ABY]]\n|before=Eventually [[Tycho Celchu]]\n|after=[[Myn Donos]]\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kether, Ran}}\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rogue Squadron personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
