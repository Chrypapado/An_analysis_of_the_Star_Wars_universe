When she came in, Vula told her she didn't have an appointment. Despite that, Surik got in. On her way out, after her [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|encounter]] with Slusk and [[Luxa]], she asked Surik not to kill her. Surik told her to leave the Exchange Suites if she wanted to live. She quickly did so.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWhen first meeting Vula the player has several options:\nPersuade/Force persuade her, or tell her you don't have an appointment. If the latter is chosen, or you fail the persuade check, four [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorreans]] attack you in the next room.\nAfter your first fight in the Exchange Suites, you can optionally decide to kill Vula, thus gaining dark side points.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vula\n}}\n\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
