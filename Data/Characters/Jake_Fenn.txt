When the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakata]] attacked the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]] in what came to be known as the [[Force Wars]], Fenn served as a general and fought to prevent the Empire from taking control of the [[Settled Worlds]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], Jake Fenn was trained in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Je'daii Order]] on the planet [[Tython/Legends|Tython]], one of nine planets in the [[Tython system/Legends|Tython system]] which made up the [[Settled Worlds]]. Born into a family strong in the Force, Fenn's sister [[Rori Fenn|Rori]] was a [[Je'daii Ranger]].<ref name=\"PoB2\">[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 2]]</ref> Appointed as a [[Je'daii Temple Master]] sometime prior to [[25,808 BBY]],<ref name=\"Void\">''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]''</ref> Fenn governed the Great Temple of the Arts, [[Bodhi]]. Carrying a single [[Force-imbued blade]], Fenn and the other Temple Masters formed the [[Je'daii Council]], meeting via [[Holocomm/Legends|holocommunication]] at the Temple of Balance, [[Akar Kesh]].<ref name=\"DotJ4\" />\n\nA friend of Je'daii Master [[Lanoree Brock's father|Brock]], Brock's son [[Dalien Brock|Dalien]] suspected the Temple Master praised his work only due to his respect for his father.<ref name=\"Void\" /> In [[25,793 BBY]] Fenn communicated with the rest of the Masters' Council when the [[Devourer (Rakatan ship)|''Devourer'']] crashed on Tython, causing a massive and devastating [[Force Storm]].<ref name=\"DotJ4\" /> Joining the other Temple Masters in meditation, Fenn and his colleagues helped to disperse the Force Storm and prevent it from completely devastating the planet.<ref name=\"DotJ5\" /> Later, following the escape of the [[Force Hound]] [[Tau (individual)|Xesh]] and exiled Je'daii [[Daegen Lok]] from the moon of [[Bogan]], Fenn and his sister led a team of Je'daii in pursuit of the pair. Flying two [[Peacemaker-class cruiser|''Peacemaker''-class cruisers]] in chase, Fenn and his team of Je'daii including [[Je'daii Journeyer|Journeyer]] [[Sek'nos Rath]] and Ranger [[Bel Zana]] investigated the cells on Bogan only to discover it filled with [[terenta]].<ref name=\"PoB2\" /> Tracking him to [[Krev Coeur]], Fenn and his fellow Je'daii engaged the pair within the crystal mines. Dueling with Lok, Fenn remarked on Lok's arrogance before the exile slashed him across the chest. Seeking out Fenn's darkest fear, Lok realized that Fenn cared for Ranger Zana and used the Force to toss her over the cliff and twisting her mind to make her think she was on fire. As Lok and Xesh fled, Rath sacrificed himself to save Zana so that Fenn could rush her to a medical facility. Rushing her to [[Kalimahr]], Fenn contacted the other Je'daii to let them know of Zana's condition and the fact Rath may be dead.<ref>[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 3]]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 4]] {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm'' 5]] {{Vision}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 2|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 2]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 3]]\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 4|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 4]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan 5|''Dawn of the Jedi: The Prisoner of Bogan'' 5]] {{Mo}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Force War 3|''Dawn of the Jedi: Force War'' 3]] {{Vision|Xesh}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jake Fenn\n|fr=Jake Fenn\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u043a \u0424\u0435\u043d\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fenn, Jake}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Je'daii Temple Masters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
