He was well-traveled and knew several stories and secrets connected to establishments like [[Bantha Traxx]] and [[Exovar's Emporium]].\n\n==Biography==\nCohden K'Reye was a world galactic traveler and had spent time in bars all across the [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. Sometime around [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]] he offered to give would-be adventurers the heads up about some of the galaxies most wretched hives of scum and villainy for 20 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]].\n\nK'Reye had gambled at the infamous [[Casino/Legends|casino]] The [[Ace of Sabres]], he had traded at the elusive [[Exovar's Emporium]] and he had gambled on the fights in the [[Dool Arena]] at [[the Broken Tusk]]. The loud mouthed [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] had made deals with [[Yin Vocta]] at the [[Bantha Traxx]] and he had seen [[Blizz Pinnix]] race on his remarkable [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] the ''[[Black Raptor]]''. He had partied at the [[Glow Dome]] and was clever enough to realize the dangers at [[Starlyte Station]]. In the end he put together his thoughts and stories into a travelog that he sold around the galaxy.<ref name=\"WHSV\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|But since you brought up the subject of exotic locations, I think visiting a sonic shower should be tops on your travel itinerary, pal.|Cohden K'Reye to a [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] stranger|Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy}}\nK'Reye was loud, cocky, and brimming with confidence. A typical Corellian he was not afraid to speak his mind. He was skeptical about [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and put his faith into more tangible items. He could talk at length about almost any topic and seemed to have a story about almost everyone.\n\nK'Reye would use [[Urrtie|his uncle's]] advice as the basis for his own wisdom imparted to fellow adventurers.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|By the way, the correct answer to the question I originally posed is a big ol' Death Star-sized YES.|Cohden K'Reye|Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy}}\nDespite his loud mouth and brash attitude, K'Reye was a keen observer and had a good eye at figuring out what exactly was going on behind the scenes. For someone uninvolved he had tremendous knowledge of numerous criminal organizations and was willing to share that information, for a price.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCohden K'Reye was designed by [[Paul Danner]] and [[Bill Smith]] for ''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'', a supplement for the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]'' that was published by [[West End Games]] in [[1997]]. He was illustrated by [[Joey Robinson]] throughout the book. K'Reye was created to be the narrator for the RPG supplement and there were numerous segments where he would appear in a sidebar to provide additional information and provide adventure plot hooks.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Wretched Hives of Scum & Villainy]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:K'Reye, Cohden}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
