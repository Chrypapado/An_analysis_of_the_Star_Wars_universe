She was possessed of unwavering loyalty to Fel and an icy demeanor that saw her rigidly believe that an Imperial Knight's duty was to obey the Emperor's commands above all else, even the will of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Dare was trained as an Imperial Knight by Master [[Treis Sinde]] prior to [[137 ABY]], and in that year, she accompanied the Emperor as he [[Fall of Bastion|retook]] the [[fortress world]] of [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] from the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Krayt]]'s [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Imperial forces]]. She and Sinde were later sent by Fel to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Dac]] to sabotage the construction of a new [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] belonging to Krayt's Empire, and they planted three sets of explosives on the nearly-completed [[Alliance (Imperious-class)|''Imperious'']].\n\nWhen the [[Destroyer/Legends|Destroyer]] was [[Battle of Mon Calamari (Second Imperial Civil War)|seized]] by [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]] of the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]], Dare and Sinde infiltrated [[One Sith|Sith]]&ndash;Imperial-occupied Dac and [[Massacre of New Coral City|rescued]] several Alliance [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] from the clutches of Krayt's forces in an attempt to warn Stazi of the explosives they had planted. Sinde was stranded on the world, but their actions paved the way toward an eventual alliance between Stazi's [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] and Fel's Empire. Dare was later sent back to Dac to retrieve Sinde, and was accompanied by the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Asaak Dan]] at both Dan's and Stazi's behest. When Sinde informed Dare that he would be staying on-planet to continue aiding the [[Mon Calamari Rangers]] in their fight against Krayt's forces, she angrily [[Incident on Dac|engaged]] her former Master in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]] that was quickly halted by Dan's intervention; Dan then took Sinde's place with the rangers and allowed both Knights to return to Bastion.\n\nDare and Sinde soon after joined a contingent of Imperial Knights that accompanied the Emperor to [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] in order to conduct [[Mission to Agamar|peace talks]] with the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]]. The meeting was [[Operation: Thunderstroke|interrupted]] by forces of the One [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], but the Emperor and most of the Imperial Knights were able to evacuate the planet. The solidified three-way alliance between the Empire-in-exile, Galactic Alliance, and the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] later [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|attacked]] Krayt's throneworld of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], and Dare was part of an [[Cade Skywalker's strike team|advanced strike team]] that infiltrated the planet and sabotaged its [[Orbit/Legends|orbital]] defenses. She was non-fatally [[Shiak|stabbed]] by a Sith during the battle, and Krayt was [[Death/Legends|slain]], an event which fractured his Sith Order and won the war for the allies. The Emperor was also killed after falling to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], and Dare attended his [[Funeral of Roan Fel|funeral]] in the battle's aftermath.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early service===\n{{Quote|I was the one who taught you how to ''use'' that lightsaber.''\"<br />\"''Perhaps you ''taught'' me, Master Sinde, but in our last several practice rounds, I ''surpassed'' you!|Treis Sinde and Sigel Dare|Legacy (2006) 42}}\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Sigel Dare was trained as an [[Imperial Knight]] by [[Imperial Knight#Mastery|Master]] [[Treis Sinde]]<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 42: Divided Loyalties\" /> and, after reaching Knighthood, became fully qualified to serve [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]] as a [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguard]] and [[Agent/Legends|agent]].<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\">''[[Legacy Era Campaign Guide]]''</ref> At some point prior to [[137 ABY]], Dare attained the rank of Master,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 35: Storms, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 35|''Legacy'' (2006) 35]]</ref> a title reserved only for the highest ranking Imperial Knights.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> During sparring sessions with Sinde, she came to surpass her teacher's [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|skills]] with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 42: Divided Loyalties\" />\n\n===Second Imperial Civil War===\n====Sabotaging the ''Imperious''====\n{{Quote|Jedi?''\"<br />\"''Better.

Dare accompanied Fel as he arrived on-[[Planet/Legends|planet]], along with fellow Imperial Knights [[Antares Draco]] and [[Ganner Krieg]]. After securing the loyalty of the Imperial forces stationed on the [[fortress world]], Fel believed that his [[Empire-in-exile|Empire]] could now become a more potent threat to Krayt.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 3: Broken, Part 3\">[[Legacy (2006) 3|''Legacy'' (2006) 3]]</ref>\n\n[[Standard week/Legends|Weeks]] later,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 17: Claws of the Dragon, Part 4\">[[Legacy (2006) 17|''Legacy'' (2006) 17]]</ref> Fel sent Dare and Sinde on a mission to sabotage the [[Imperious-class Star Destroyer|Advanced Star Destroyer]] [[Alliance (Imperious-class)|''Imperious'']], which was nearing completion at the [[Mon Calamari Shipyards/Legends|Mon Calamari Shipyards]], as destroying the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|vessel]] would mean denying its usage to [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt's Empire. Undercover and in plainclothes, Sinde and Dare were dispatched to [[Dac]] to infiltrate and destroy the [[Starship/Legends|ship]]. The pair planted three sets of explosives, the first two of which they expected to be found; the third they anticipated to remain undiscovered. The explosives were primed to go off when the ''Imperious''{{'s}} weapon systems came online during its shakedown cruise. The hope was that the ship would be far enough away from Dac so that the planet's native [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] would not be blamed for its destruction.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 22: The Wrath of the Dragon\">[[Legacy (2006) 22|''Legacy'' (2006) 22]]</ref>\n\nThe plan hit a snag, however, when [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]] of the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]] executed his [[Battle of Mon Calamari (Second Imperial Civil War)|own mission]] to steal the ''Imperious'' from Krayt's Empire, hoping to add the ship to his fleet's [[Galactic Alliance Core Fleet|arsenal]]. Stazi's plan succeeded,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 21: Indomitable, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 21|''Legacy'' (2006) 21]]</ref> and Sinde realized that the explosives would not be discovered by the Alliance. Although he decided that he and Dare needed to warn Stazi of the sabotage, Dare did not share her former instructor's views, feeling that the [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] admiral was as much an enemy of Roan Fel's Empire as Darth Krayt was. However, Sinde felt that Fel hoped to ally with Stazi against Krayt and felt that he and Dare could convince him of their good intentions by warning him of the threat posed by the explosives.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 22: The Wrath of the Dragon\" />\n\n====Escape from Dac====\n{{Quote|Uh, who are your 'friends'?''\"<br />\"''They're Imperial Knights&hellip; I know&mdash;I had the same reaction.|Rogue Squadron pilots Ronto and Monia Gahan, regarding Dare and Treis Sinde|Legacy (2006) 22}}\nAngered at the loss of the ''Imperious'', Darth Krayt brought a legion of [[One Sith|Sith]] and [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] to Dac, and ordered the [[Genocide on Dac|execution]] of ten percent of the Mon Calamari population, [[Massacre of New Coral City|beginning with]] the members of the [[Mon Calamari Council]]. As [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] and stormtroopers swarmed [[New Coral City/Legends|New Coral City]], Dare and Sinde, still in plainclothes, ignited their [[Imperial Knight lightsaber|lightsabers]] and fought their way through Krayt's forces in order to locate [[Monia Gahan]], a member of [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] and the niece of former [[Senator/Legends|senator]] and [[Triumvirate (Galactic Alliance)|Galactic Alliance Triumvirate]] member [[Gial Gahan]]. The two Imperial Knights anticipated that she could help them locate Stazi. Finding Gahan, Dare and Sinde saved her from [[Death/Legends|execution]] at the hands of a squad of stormtroopers. Sinde then informed her of the situation and told her that she would be taken off-planet in order to enable himself and Dare to reach the admiral. Still wary of their plan, Dare taunted Gahan, telling her that Stazi had been outsmarted, but was in turn reprimanded by Sinde.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 22: The Wrath of the Dragon\" />\n\n[[File:Sinde_and_Dare.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Dare and Master Treis Sinde help rescue Galactic Alliance pilots held prisoner on Dac.]]\nGahan agreed to help them, on the condition that they assisted in the [[Massacre of New Coral City|rescue]] of Alliance [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] that had been captured during the battle. Dare saw it as an unnecessary risk but was willing to defer to Sinde's wisdom. With Gahan at their side, Dare and Sinde cut their way through [[Legion/Legends|legions]] of stormtroopers as the Mon Calamari rescued her fellow pilots from a [[Prison/Legends|prison]] cell. Sinde quickly laid out a plan: everyone who could fit into stormtrooper [[Armor/Legends|armor]] would wear it as a disguise, and Dare would pose as an Imperial [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]]. With the plan put into motion, the ensemble made their way to the [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]] levels. Dare used a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to convince the [[Captain/Legends|captain]] on-duty that they were authorized to load [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] aboard the [[Darth Azard's Nune-class shuttle|personal shuttle]] of [[Darth Azard]], a [[Quarren/Legends|Quarren]] Sith [[Lord/Legends|Lord]]. Boarding the [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]], Sinde and Dare incapacitated the crew. Before they could take off, Sinde saw Azard approaching; the Sith Lord had sensed a [[Disturbance in the Force/Legends|disturbance in the Force]]. Sinde ordered Dare to take the shuttle to a rendezvous with Stazi, then leaped down into the hangar to engage Azard.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 22: The Wrath of the Dragon\" />\n\nUnfazed by Gahan's horror that she would leave her partner behind, Dare prepared to follow Sinde's instructions. As her former Master [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|dueled Azard]] in a delaying action, Dare [[Telekinesis/Legends|used the Force]] to jettison a fuel tank into the path of the shuttle's rear guns, and instructed one of the pilots to [[Laser/Legends|fire]] on it. A massive explosion engulfed the hangar, covering the shuttle's escape and distracting Azard long enough for Sinde to dive off the hangar level and flee himself.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 22: The Wrath of the Dragon\" />\n\nAfter taking the shuttle to the ''Imperious'', now in the hands of Stazi and rechristened the ''Alliance'', the pilots brought Dare to an audience with the Duros admiral. Dare informed him of the third set of explosives, which were swiftly disarmed. Tension mounted between Stazi and a disrespectful Dare, but Gahan cut through the strained relations and asserted that Master Sinde had been correct: the Sith were the common enemies of both Stazi and Emperor Fel, and it would be beneficial for the two to become allies. Dare and Gahan agreed that Sinde had been willing to [[Suicide/Legends|sacrifice himself]] for the greater good, and Stazi realized the necessity of bringing down Krayt. He instructed Dare to contact Roan Fel and inform him of his willingness to create an alliance, and Dare respectfully bowed to his wishes.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 22: The Wrath of the Dragon\" />\n\n====Retrieving Sinde====\n{{Quote|You will return with me or you will die here!

After finally being able to make contact with Sinde,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 33: Fight Another Day, Part 2\">[[Legacy (2006) 33|''Legacy'' (2006) 33]]</ref> Fel summoned Dare to an audience along with Antares Draco and Ganner Krieg, who had just reported back from a [[Mission to Had Abbadon|mission]] that saw the apparent [[Battle on Had Abbadon|death of Darth Krayt]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 31: Vector, Part 12\">[[Legacy (2006) 31|''Legacy'' (2006) 31]]</ref> In the wake of the Sith Lord's demise, the Emperor handed out orders to all three Knights; Dare was to go to Dac and retrieve Sinde,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 35: Storms, Part 2\" /> who was needed to train more Imperial Knights.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 33: Fight Another Day, Part 2\" />\n\nDare traveled to the [[Arkanis sector/Legends|Arkanis sector]] and once again met with Admiral Gar Stazi aboard the ''Alliance''. During Dare's visit, the admiral was also host to four [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]], all of whom had been dispatched by the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi Council]] in order to aid Stazi's alliance with Roan Fel. When Dare asked Stazi for the use of one of the ''Alliance''{{'s}} Imperial shuttles to allow her to covertly slip into Dac, [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Master [[Asaak Dan]] asked to come along. Dan was fascinated by what he had heard about Sinde's work with the Mon Calamari Rangers, but his request was met with steadfast refusal. However, Dare's conviction was overridden by the admiral, who reminded her that the shuttle, and consequently the decision, was his.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 42: Divided Loyalties\" />\n\n''En route'' to Dac, Dare hatched a plan that saw her dress as an [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] [[Officer/Legends|officer]] and Dan as one of her agents. Bothered by Master Dan's presence, she repeatedly informed him of the plan and its details, creating a hostility between the two of them, albeit one that was reciprocated in a largely mock-serious manner. After landing on Dac, they were able to bypass security with the aid of a mind trick on Dare's part, and then rendezvoused with Sinde and the Mon Calamari Ranger [[Tanquar]]. Hoping to leave the planet quickly, Dare informed her former Master of the awaiting ship, and was shocked to hear that he intended to remain on Dac. Sinde believed that [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] was telling him to remain with the Rangers, but Dare, angrily igniting her lightsaber, insisted that an Imperial Knight's personal loyalty to the Emperor transcended what the Force told them. Sinde didn't wish to fight, but Dare was adamant: he would return with her, or he would die on Dac. Dismayed that Dare, and younger Imperial Knights in general, were losing sight of the true purposes of their organization, Sinde reluctantly engaged his former student in a [[Incident on Dac|lightsaber duel]].<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 42: Divided Loyalties\" />\n\n[[File:DanDareSinde-Leg42.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Jedi Master Asaak Dan halts Dare's attempt to kill her former Master.]]\nAs the two fought, Master Dan ignited his own lightsaber and intervened, enraging Dare in the process. Halting the duel by Force-pushing Dare into Sinde, he suggested to Sinde that it was his duty to return to Bastion and train young Imperial Knights correctly, and offered to stay on Dac and help the Rangers in Sinde's place. After the elder Imperial Knight accepted, he and Dare prepared to depart the planet, and Dare grudgingly admitted that the Jedi Master was skilled and brave.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 42: Divided Loyalties\" />\n\n====Peace talks on Agamar====\n{{Quote|The ''War Hammer''{{'s}} attack has started!

During the session, Dare took notes as she watched.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 43: Monster, Part 1\">[[Legacy (2006) 43|''Legacy'' (2006) 43]]</ref> She later joined a contingent of Imperial Knights in accompanying the Emperor and his daughter, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Marasiah Fel]], to [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] in order to conduct [[Mission to Agamar|peace talks]] with the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]].

The following morning, they met with representatives from the Jedi, led by Master [[K'Kruhk]]. Everyone present disguised themselves as [[Agamarian]] [[Farm/Legends|farmers]],<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\">[[Legacy (2006) 45|''Legacy'' (2006) 45]]</ref> and several of the Imperial Knights positioned themselves away from the meeting, pretending to work on a nearby field.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" /><ref name=\"Legacy 46\">[[Legacy (2006) 46|''Legacy'' (2006) 46]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Letsdance.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Krieg, Dare, and Jedi Master Rasi Tuum prepare to defend the Emperor from a group of Sith on Agamar.]]\nA formal alliance was struck, and Fel declared Bastion a safe haven for both the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance. Yet, the parleying was interrupted by an approaching intruder riding a [[Agamarian beast|local animal]]. Master Sinde ordered Dare and Master Krieg to open fire, and the two hit the beast with shots from [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]] until Fel recognized the rider as [[Morrigan Corde|Nyna Calixte]], the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] for Krayt's Empire who had held the same title under Fel's leadership prior to the conclusion of the Sith\u2013Imperial War. Calixte hurriedly told the assembled party that the Sith were aware of the meeting and had [[Operation: Thunderstroke|sent]] a [[First Sith Imperial Strikeforce|task force]] under the command of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Rulf Yage]] to capture or kill the Emperor. As the task force, led by the [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[War Hammer]]'', engaged Fel's [[Dauntless (Pellaeon-class)|''Dauntless'']] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]], she suggested that the Imperial Knights and Jedi run if they wanted to survive.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 45: Monster, Part 3\" />\n\nThe Imperial Knights and Jedi were quickly advanced upon by a group of Sith that emerged from nearby swamps. Dare lit her lightsaber when Draco and K'Kruhk called on their respective parties to defend Emperor Fel, and all disguises were shed as a battle ensued. At least ten Sith fell to the blades of the Imperial Knights and Jedi, as well as to Calixte's [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]],<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" /> although several Imperial Knights and Jedi died as well.<ref name=\"Legacy 48\">[[Legacy (2006) 48|''Legacy'' (2006) 48]]</ref> Draco hailed the Imperial Knights' escape shuttle, ''[[Defender One]]'', which landed near the site of the melee in order to evacuate the Emperor. As Sinde and K'Kruhk began clearing a path toward the shuttle, the surviving Imperial Knights and Jedi boarded, save for Marasiah, Rae, and the Jedi [[Rasi Tuum]], who were too far away. Draco gave the order for the shuttle to lift off, and ''Defender One'' escaped the planet as the ''Dauntless'' held a corridor of [[Realspace/Legends|space]] open for them, taking the brunt of the ''War Hammer''{{'s}} attack and being destroyed in the process.<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" />\n\n====Into the fire====\n{{Quote|Sigel!|Ganner Krieg reacts to Dare getting stabbed on Coruscant|Legacy\u2014War 5}}\nThe Emperor, as well as the surviving Imperial Knights and Jedi who escaped, returned to Bastion to recuperate.

A [[Funeral of Roan Fel|funeral]] was held for Fel in the battle's aftermath, and Dare was among the attendees as Master Chalk delivered a eulogy.

The title indicated that she was one of the organization's highest-ranking members.<ref name=\"Legacy Era Campaign Guide\" /> Dare was fiercely loyal to the cause of Emperor Roan Fel, and was very rigid in her approach to her duty,<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 0\" /> an approach which her former Master, Treis Sinde, saw as blinding her to the larger picture. While with Sinde on Dac, Dare was very reluctant to warn Admiral Gar Stazi of the explosives planted aboard his new [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], as she felt that he was as much an enemy to her Emperor as the Sith were. Even while working to warn Stazi, Dare was smug in her actions, taunting several Galactic Alliance pilots and insisting that she and Sinde had outsmarted the admiral. In Stazi's presence, she sarcastically reminded him that her actions had played a large part in the disarming of the explosives; if the decision had been hers and not Sinde's, Dare would have left the Galactic Alliance pilots on Dac to die and allowed Stazi to perish aboard the ''Alliance''.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Legacy 22: The Wrath of the Dragon\" />\n\nDare maintained that an Imperial Knight's duty was ultimately to the Emperor, rather than the Force as embodied by the Emperor. When retrieving Sinde from Dac, she insisted that he obey their Emperor's orders rather than listen to what the Force was telling him.
