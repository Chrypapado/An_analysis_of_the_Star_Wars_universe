When he first met an amnesiac [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who came to [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] in search of a [[Star Map]], he misjudged the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi]] as just another [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka]] slaver because he was a [[Human/Legends|Human]]. Later, Revan retrieved the blade of the great [[Bacca]]'s [[Bacca's Ceremonial Blade|sword]] and gave it to ex-[[Chief/Legends|chieftain]] [[Freyyr]], who had been exiled by [[Chuundar]], Freyyr's son. When Freyyr came back to [[Rwookrrorro/Legends|Rwookrrorro]] with this important artifact to challenge Chuundar, Chorrawl sided with Freyyr. He helped to overthrow Chuundar and return Freyyr to his rightful place as chieftain.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Chorrawl\n|fi=Chorrawl\n|ru=\u0427\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hunters]]\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
