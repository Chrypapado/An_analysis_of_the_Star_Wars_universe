While being transported to [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]], [[Jerris Rudd]] hid both girls that later were discovered by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. Luke tried to help them both to escape, but Oola was suspicious. Rudd came and a fight began. Luke deflected all bolts from Rudd's blaster and killed him, providing the dancers a chance to escape. Oola then distracted the recently arrived Fortuna and urged Sienn to flee, hoping to save her from Fortuna, who she had realized was evil.<ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" />\n\nShe would later return to Ryloth and would remain grateful to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] for her rescue for years afterward. During [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron's]] mission to [[Ryloth/Legends|Ryloth]] to obtain [[Ryll kor]], Sienn'rha was one of the dancers who entertained the [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]]. She passed a message to [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] that she would entertain him with a private dance if he wished, an offer he politely declined.<ref name=\"X-Wing: The Krytos Trap\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''</ref>\n\nSienn was a name commonly attributed to Twi'lek females, and meant ''maiden'' in the [[Twi'leki/Legends|Twi'leki]] language.<ref name=\"Galactic Campaign Guide\">''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSienn was created by author [[Kathy Tyers]] for [[A Time to Mourn, a Time to Dance: Oola's Tale|Oola's story]] in ''[[Tales from Jabba's Palace]]''.<ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" /> Later [[1996|that year]], [[Michael A. Stackpole]] gave her a brief appearance in ''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'', in which he introduced her full Twi'leki name of Sienn'rha.<ref name=\"X-Wing: The Krytos Trap\" />\n\nSienn's entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' inaccurately states that she was presented to Jabba the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] along with Oola, and afterward rescued from Jabba's Palace by Luke Skywalker. All other sources, including Oola's entry in the same encyclopedia, maintain that Skywalker freed her in Mos Eisley before she could be taken to Jabba.<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref><ref name=\"Oola's Tale\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Time to Mourn, a Time to Dance: Oola's Tale]]'' {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]'' {{1stID|Sienn'rha}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galactic Campaign Guide]]''\n*{{FFCite|77|TWI8, ''Twi'leks''}}\n*{{FFCite|96|TWI20-22, ''Twi'leks - Oola''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 6]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|oola|Oola|archivedate=20110524221931}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|139|Classic Moment}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sienn'rha\n|es=Sienn'rha\n|pl=Sienn'rha\n|ru=\u0421\u0438\u0435\u043d\u043d'\u0440\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
