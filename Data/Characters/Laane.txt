In [[3951 BBY]], during the [[Dark Wars]], he was part of the [[Onderon separatists]] that followed [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]] in the [[Onderon Civil War]] against the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]]-backed [[Onderon/Legends|Onderonian]] [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]]. In that [[Standard year/Legends|year]], Laane was part of a scout team under the command of [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] that was sent to the jungle [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]], which [[Orbit/Legends|orbited]] the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] Onderon. Laane and the team were ordered to eliminate [[Meetra Surik]] after the Onderon separatists [[Blockade of Onderon|forced]] her [[Ebon Hawk|freighter]] to land on the moon. When the team began their search, Laane was immediately surrounded by a pack of indigenous [[cannok]]s and was eventually [[Death/Legends|killed]] by the beasts. Soon afterward, [[Kelborn]], a scout who had been sent from [[Mandalorians (Clan Ordo)|a Mandalorian clan]] hiding on the moon, discovered his body.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Looks like a scout, and pretty green, too. The fool walked right into a group of cannoks and got torn apart.|Kelborn|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nLaane was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived during the [[Standard year/Legends|years]] prior to and during<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> the [[Dark Wars]].<ref name=\"kotorcg\" /> He was employed as a [[Scout/Legends|scout]] in the [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]] [[Onderonian military|military]]. Along with [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Tobin (Human)|Tobin]] and the majority of the Onderonian military under Tobin's command, Laane was part of the [[Onderon separatists]] following the commander-in-chief of the military, [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]], who opposed the rule of pro-[[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] Onderonian [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> In [[3951 BBY]],<ref name=\"kotorcg\" /> the separatists had allied with [[Sith Triumvirate|remnants]] of [[Darth Malak]]'s [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] and were required to partake in the elimination of [[Lost Jedi]]. In that year, the [[Blockade of Onderon|first battle]] of the [[Onderon Civil War]] began when the Onderon separatists' [[Realspace/Legends|space]] forces fired on a small [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]], the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', which carried the former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]<ref name=\"kotor2\" /> [[Meetra Surik]],<ref name=\"revan\">''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''</ref> after they located the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] among the [[Blockade/Legends|blockaded]] ships above Onderon. The attack damaged the ''Ebon Hawk'', and the ship was forced to land on the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]], [[Dxun/Legends|Dxun]].<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\nColonel Tobin [[Skirmish on Dxun|sent]] Laane and a team of scouts to the surface of the moon to find Surik. Despite an attempt by the freighter that carried Laane's scout team to stealthily land on the moon to avoid detection, their craft was picked up by radar of a [[Mandalorians (Clan Ordo)|Mandalorian clan]] hiding in the jungles of the moon. After the separatist scouts landed and spread out, Laane was caught by a group of [[cannok]]s&mdash;small, indigenous predators that populated the jungle in great numbers. Surrounded by the animals, Laane was [[Death/Legends|killed]] while one of his teammates bore witness. Soon a [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] scout named [[Kelborn]], who was sent there to investigate the intruders, found Laane's body among the flora of the jungle.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nA moment later, Meetra Surik and her companions encountered Kelborn and the body of Laane and, after hearing the Mandalorian's task, volunteered to aid Kelborn in locating and hunting down the rest of separatist scouts.<ref name=\"kotor2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:LaaneKelborn.png|thumb|right|Kelborn, upon finding Laane dead]]\n{{Quote|The only thing the scouts had on them were weapons.

During the mission on Dxun to find Meetra Surik, Laane did not carry any [[Identicard/Legends|identification card]], though he did carry a [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]].
