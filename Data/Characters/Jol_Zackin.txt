As the [[Galactic War]] broke out in [[3641 BBY]], Zackin was dismayed to see Corellia's [[Corellian Council|ruling council]] aid the Empire in conquering his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], and Zackin aided the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military]] during the subsequent [[Battle of Corellia]] with his knowledge of the planet and its [[Corellian/Legends|people]]. He enlisted the aid of the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] known as the [[Hero of Tython]], the [[Supreme Commander (Jedi)|Supreme Commander]] of all [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] forces on the planet, to rescue civilians who had been kidnapped by the Empire from Corellian [[Prison/Legends|prisons]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Those 'citizens' are being 'kidnapped' from your prisons!

When the Empire began raiding Corellian [[Prison/Legends|prisons]] and forcing civilians who were in custody awaiting trial into labor, Zackin was outraged and begged [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Brint]], one of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Var Suthra]]'s subordinates in the district of [[Axial Park]], to commit some of his forces to rescue the civilians. However, Brint believed that the rescue attempt would be a waste of resources and was quick to dismiss those civilians as unworthy criminals, as the Empire was sending extermination patrols to the Republic's medical evacuation sites and [[Death/Legends|killing]] their wounded. When the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] known as the [[Hero of Tython]], the [[Supreme Commander (Jedi)|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] forces on the planet, arrived at Brint's command post in the [[Corellian Science Museum]], Zackin asked the Jedi to help rescue the captive civilians.<ref name=\"Firestorm\" />\n\n{{GameLS|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nZackin was outraged when Brint attempted to bribe the Knight with advanced combat equipment from [[Balmorra/Legends|Balmorra]], but to the Senator's relief the Hero agreed to commit the Jedi forces to Zackin's cause. While the Knight destroyed the Imperials' [[Firestorm Turbolaser]]s and halted the plans of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] to cause massive casualties, the Jedi's [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Unaw Aharo]] led the Hero's forces to rescue the civilians. The Senator later expressed his gratitude to the Hero before the Knight led the other Jedi deeper into the heart of [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] as the Republic gained ground against the Empire.<ref name=\"Firestorm\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Supreme Commander, we've received advanced combat gear from Balmorra.

When he learned that Corellians were being kidnapped from prisons, he believed that they should be saved regardless that they were in prison&mdash;to Zackin, they were innocent until proven guilty. He was also outraged when Colonel Brint attempted to bribe the Hero of Tython, finding the [[Republic officer/Legends|officer's]] desire for revenge and his willingness to commit crimes to be morally reprehensible.<ref name=\"Firestorm\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|I can't believe you!
