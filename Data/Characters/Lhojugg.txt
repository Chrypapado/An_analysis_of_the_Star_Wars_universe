He was the cousin of [[Mosep Binneed/Legends|Mosep Binneed]].<ref>[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']]</ref>\n\nJabba was upset when Lhojugg interrupted his favorite song \"[[Talcharaim Mist-Night]]\", and became irritated by Lhojugg's investigation initiative which Jabba didn't ask for, so he ordered the Nimbanel to be fed to his [[Kayven whistler]]s.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:JabbaHut.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Jabba the Hut.]]\nThere is much fan speculation about Jabba's Nimbanel appearance in ''What Ever Happened to Jabba the Hut?'' [''sic''] and ''In Mortal Combat''. A popular fan theory is that the Jabba in these issues was in fact Lhojugg masquerading as his master; considering the active physical role \"Jabba\" plays in issue 28, the story would, according to the theorists, make more sense with Mosep (or even more likely [[Lhojugg]]) rather than the relatively immobile Jabba. Some fans also suggest that Mosep/Lhojugg used the alias of \"Jabba the Hut\"&mdash;Hutt was originally spelled with a single T until [[1980]]&mdash;and that other mentions of Jabba using the \"Hut\" spelling are actually references to Mosep/Lhojugg. ''[[Star Wars]]'' author [[Abel G. Pe\u00f1a]] has acknowledged the theory on the [[StarWars.com]] message boards, stating that it makes sense and will surely be made an official [[retcon]] in time.<ref name=\"sw.com\">[http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=239641&start=45 Marvel's take on Star Wars] at the [[StarWars.com]] message boards</ref> The old ''Star Wars'' [[Databank (original)|Databank]] stated that the events in ''What Ever Happened to Jabba the Hut?'' [''sic''] may have happened in some shape or form, but not how they are presented in the comic.<ref name=\"db\">{{DB|character|jabbathehutt|Jabba the Hutt|archivedate=20101220014534}}</ref> The novel [[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']] by [[John Jackson Miller]] establishes that Lhojugg and his cousin, Mosep, were joint caretakers of Jabba's office in Mos Eisley, representing his name, so that Jabba was \"always in\" at the office. Mosep would sometimes travel under Jabba's name, representing his interests, indicating that the Jabba from the Marvel comics may have been Mosep.\n\nIn the [[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)|''A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale'' webstrip adaptation]], set a short time before ''A New Hope'', a Nimbanel wearing similar attire to Mosep can be seen in [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Court]]. It is possible that this character is Mosep, though may also be Lhojugg, his predecessor as Jabba's main accountant, as Lhojugg's creator, Pablo Hidalgo, illustrated the webstrip.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']]\n*[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]]\n*{{Journal|11|Spare Parts (short story)|Spare Parts}} {{1st}}\n*[[A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale (webstrip)|''A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale'' webstrip]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Desilijic servants]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nimbanels]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
