In [[13 BBY/Legends|13 BBY]], Lenovar was shot to death by Fett after Lenovar raped the latter's wife, [[Sintas Vel]]. His murder led to Fett's expulsion from the Protectors and exile from Concord Dawn, as well as the subsequent break-up of Fett's family. When on trial for his life, Boba Fett's only comment on his crime was that he wished he'd killed the man years earlier, and that the universe was a better place without him.\n\nThe famous [[Pleader]] [[Iving Creel]] pled Fett unrepentant for Lenovar's murder.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead 3|''Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead'' 3]] {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n*[[Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead 4|''Blood Ties: Boba Fett is Dead'' 4]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]'' {{Mo}} {{1stID}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Revelation]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lenovar\n}}\n\n[[Category:Concord Dawn residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]"}}}]}}}}
