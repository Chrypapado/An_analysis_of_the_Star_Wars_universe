Why buy a child just to kill her?''\"<br />\"''Because I '''could.'''|[[Dass Jennir]] and Dezono Qua|Dark Times 5}}\n'''Dezono Qua''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Esseles/Legends|Esseles]]. He was the sole heir of a wealthy family, and was not well-liked. He lived alone at his family [[Qua family's villa|villa]] with [[Droid/Legends|droids]] as his only companions. He had a small army of [[IG-series/Legends|IG-series]] droids, an [[H2]] pilot droid, and a protocol droid nicknamed \"[[E-10]].\"\n\nQua, believing that his money allowed him to do anything he wished, had the habit of eating [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] beings. He purchased [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]], often young ones, of different [[Species/Legends|species]], only to have E-10 cook and serve them to him. He purchased a child slave from slave trader [[Orso Meeto]] on [[Orvax IV]] every ten days. [[Resa Greenbark]] was one of the unfortunate slaves bought for food. After Resa's [[Bomo Greenbark|father]] and the crew of the freighter ''[[Uhumele]]'' [[Assault on Dezono Qua's villa|raided]] the Qua villa in search of her, [[Dass Jennir]] shot an unarmed Qua in the chest with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] upon learning of Resa's fate.\n\nFollowing his death, Qua's family hired [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Falco Sang]] to hunt down Jennir and his companions.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I guess that makes sense. She was something... special.|Qua reflects on his meal|Dark Times 5}}\nDezono Qua was a solitary individual, who was able to cover his disturbing idiosyncrasies with wealth and power. As such, he had no conscientious individuals surrounding him in his home, and would only make use of droids with unwavering loyalty to him.\n\nIn addition to this, Qua possessed little to no empathy or sympathy for those whose relatives he had consumed, even when met face-to-face; his encounter with Bomo Greenbark and his companions reflected this. Even in the face of death at blasterpoint, Qua, in a most insensitive and blas\u00e9 manner, expressed no remorse for his deeds, only showing true emotion when reflecting on consuming Resa.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDezono Qua was first mentioned in the graphic novel installment [[Dark Times 4|''Dark Times'' 4]], and made an appearance in the subsequent installment, [[Dark Times 5|''Dark Times'' 5]]. Since then, the character has received passing mentions as a footnote in successive issues.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Dark Times 4|''Dark Times'' 4]] {{1stm}}\n*[[Dark Times 5|''Dark Times'' 5]] {{1st}}\n*''[[Dark Times: Blue Harvest, Part 1]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[Dark Times: Blue Harvest, Part 2]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Dark Times 13|''Dark Times'' 13]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Dark Times 14|''Dark Times'' 14]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Dark Times 15|''Dark Times'' 15]] {{Imo}}\n*[[Dark Times 16|''Dark Times'' 16]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Out of the Wilderness 1]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Dark Times\u2014Out of the Wilderness 5]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u0414\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043e \u041a\u0443\u0430\n|de=Dezono Qua\n|pl=Dezono Qua\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qua, Dezono}}\n[[Category:Esselians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]"}}}]}}}}
