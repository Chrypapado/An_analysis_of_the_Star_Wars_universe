Do not underestimate its power. That is why I have devoted my life to teaching Jedi Knights, to strengthen the light side against the tide of darkness that is sure to come.|Excerpt from a recording made by Vodo-Siosk Baas in the [[Tedryn Holocron]]|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 Dark Lords of the Sith 1}}\n[[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] '''Vodo-Siosk Baas''' was a venerable [[Krevaaki]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who served the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] with distinction into the onset of the [[Old Sith Wars]]. A warrior, [[Jedi historian|historian]], and expert [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] [[Jedi artisan|crafts]] [[Sentience/Legends|being]], Baas's was a life devoted to the [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] to combat [[Darksider|agents]] of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. A respected member of the [[Jedi Assembly|Assembly]] of great Masters, Baas's [[Time/Legends|time]] was divided between the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] epicenter on the [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]] and his [[Jedi Enclave|academy]] for exceptional [[Padawan/Legends|apprentices]] on the planet [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. Although several of his students achieved fame for their efforts against the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], it was while under Baas's tutelage that a young [[Human/Legends|Human]] named [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] developed a fanatical desire for knowledge forbidden by the Jedi, and abandoned his Master's wisdom in search thereof.\n\nBy [[3997 BBY]], the influence of [[Sith magic]] had resurfaced and rapidly spread across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], headquartered in the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta system]] and propagated by the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]]. Vodo-Siosk Baas answered the summons of all Jedi to [[Conclave at Deneba|convene]] on the planet [[Deneba/Legends|Deneba]] and discuss strategy against the new Sith, but while en route he experienced the despair of his errant apprentice's fall to the dark side and became even more concerned with the future safety of the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]. The [[Jedi Convocation]] was [[Battle of Deneba|assailed]] by the [[Krath war droid/Legends|Krath]], an attack that spurred Jedi Knight [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] into an [[Mission to Empress Teta|infiltration mission]] of their ranks. Baas was among several Masters in [[Meditation/Legends|meditation]] on Ossus who foresaw Qel-Droma's inevitable fall to the dark side, which culminated in his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprenticeship]] to the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] Exar Kun, who had since become the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and had begun preparations for the restoration of a [[Golden Age of the Sith|Sith Golden Age]] to the galaxy.\n\nWith the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lords]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Sith|Sith Brotherhood]] firmly enmeshed in [[Great Sith War/Legends|total war]] against the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Vodo-Siosk Baas represented the Masters of the Order on a diplomatic venture to the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] with a request for permission to handle what they considered to be an internal affair. He and his retinue of Jedi Knights subsequently participated in the [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Sith War)|successful defense]] of the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] from the invading Krath and [[Mandalorian Crusaders|Mandalorian]] [[Army/Legends|armies]], which were led by Ulic Qel-Droma. With the defeated [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] in custody and his forces repelled, Baas returned to Dantooine for a time, in contemplation of his hand in the return of the Sith. Although devastated, he became ever more determined to prevent the realization of Kun's campaign of galactic tyranny. Baas returned to Coruscant and met his former apprentice in the fully audienced [[Grand Convocation Chamber]] of the [[Senate Hall]], with a final demand for Kun's renunciation of his chosen Sith path. Baas was forced into a [[Duel in the Senate|duel]] with him, and was [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|over-matched]] when the Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] activated his [[Exar Kun's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber's]] unexpected [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|second blade]]. With his own demise at hand, Baas promised to one [[Standard day/Legends|day]] return and vanquish Kun, whose [[Death/Legends|killing]] blow then committed the Krevaaki to [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. In fulfillment of his dying prophecy, the [[Force ghost|ghost]] of Baas returned more than [[11 ABY/Legends|four thousand years]] later to assist the inaugural class of Master [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[Jedi Praxeum]] in the [[Wall of light|final defeat]] of Kun's own [[Transfer essence|disembodied]] spirit.\n\n==Biography==\n===Instructor of Jedi===\n{{Quote|My Master has been respected for centuries among our fraternity.|Exar Kun, on Vodo-Siosk Baas|Tales of the Jedi \u2013 The Sith War 1}}\nA native of his [[Species/Legends|species]]' [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Krevas]],<ref name=\"UAA\" /> Vodo-Siosk Baas was a [[Krevaaki]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] with [[Standard year/Legends|centuries]] of service to both the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] into the onset of the [[Old Sith Wars]]. A respected teacher and formidable warrior, Baas dedicated himself to the preparation of future generations of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] for battle against the inevitable return of threats armed with the power of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. A [[Jedi historian|historian]] extensively acquainted with the history of the ancient [[Sith (species)/Legends|Sith]], much of Baas's knowledge was recorded in the [[Tedryn Holocron]], a [[Jedi artifact/Legends|Jedi heirloom]] created by the ancient [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Master [[Tedryn]].<ref name=\"JVS\">[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]</ref> By [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], the Krevaaki Master had taken up instruction of [[Padawan/Legends|apprentices]] at the [[Knossa/Legends|Jedi training center]] on the [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. Study under Baas consisted of exploration of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and its application,<ref name=\"TOTJC\" /> as well as the creation of and honed [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|proficiency]] with the Jedi [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> He became the Master of several promising young apprentices, among them [[Dace Diath]], a [[Human/Legends|Human]] male adolescent from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]; the [[Nazzar]] [[Prince/Legends|Crown Prince]] [[Qrrrl Toq]]; and a timid, [[Force sight|Force-sighted]] [[Miraluka/Legends|Miraluka]] girl named [[Shoaneb Culu]]. While Diath had received previous [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] from his father, a renowned Jedi Master named [[Sidrona Diath]], and Toq had been a disciplined philosopher among his people, Baas sensed misgivings in Culu, whose limited facility with the Force had somewhat dashed her dream of taking the Jedi arts back to her homeworld of [[Alpheridies/Legends|Alpheridies]]. At first disturbed by the young girl's passion for knowledge, Baas soon realized that hers was a genuine desire for enlightenment, so he spent many [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] a [[Standard day/Legends|day]] in private instruction with her. Although her ability to command the Force was less than that of her peers, Culu achieved a matchless understanding of its nature, and became more learned in the lore of ancient Jedi, all by way of Vodo-Siosk Baas' instruction.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" />\n\n[[File:NomiMeetVodoAndDace.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Baas instructing students in lightsaber construction]]\nThat same year, centuries of [[Beast Wars|civil war]] on [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon]], an [[Inner Rim]] world that had been under the thrall of the dark side since its subjugation by a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] called [[Freedon Nadd]],<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> was brought to an end via the intervention of Jedi Knights under the guidance of the [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] Master [[Arca Jeth]]. The planet remained plagued by [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorism]] in the two years of relative peace that followed, as remnants of the [[Naddist|defeated regime]] perpetuated interference with efforts to restore planetary civilization and stability.<ref name=TOTJA\">[[Tales of the Jedi (audio)|''Tales of the Jedi audio drama'']]</ref> By [[3998 BBY]], worshipers of the dark side had again risen to prominence on Onderon, and many Jedi came to Ossus as the Order sought to marshal their forces against the new [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] threat. Baas met with a [[Tchuukthai]] Master called [[Thon]] and assumed tutelage of his apprentice, [[Nomi Sunrider]], whom Baas was to guide in the creation of her own lightsaber. Upon their first meeting, Baas [[Force sense/Legends|discerned]] that the Force was strong with the young woman, whose late [[Andur Sunrider|husband]] he had known, and in whose [[Youngling/Legends|infant]] [[Vima Sunrider|daughter]] he also sensed great potential. He introduced Sunrider to Shoaneb Culu, who had also reached the next level in her training, but had further ruined the already flawed [[lightsaber crystal]] with which, moments before, she had intended to focus her weapon. Sunrider offered one of her many [[Adegan crystal/Legends|pontites]], crystals that Baas recognized as the rarest of specimens. Over the course of a [[Standard week/Legends|week]], Baas watched as Dace Diath, Culu, Sunrider, and others fine-tuned their individual designs, until each had fashioned a fully functional lightsaber with which to do battle.<ref name=\"FNU1\" />\n\nTensions on Onderon blossomed into [[Freedon Nadd Uprising|open warfare]] when Jeth was [[First Battle of Onderon (Naddist Uprising)|captured]] by the planet's [[Sith sorcerer|sorcerer]]-[[King/Legends|king]], [[Ommin/Legends|Ommin]], and the revealed [[Force ghost|Sith spirit]] of Freedon Nadd himself. In response, a [[Jedi Convocation|convocation of Jedi]] was called on Ossus to develop a rescue mission for their beleaguered comrades on the other side of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Of all who volunteered, five were chosen: the [[Gotal/Legends|Gotal]] [[Kith Kark]], Dace Diath, Shoaneb Culu, Nomi Sunrider, and Qrrrl Toq.<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> Prior to their departure, Baas took Culu aside and expressed doubts that she was confident enough in her abilities to serve effectively on Onderon. When she calmly replied that she believed the Force was pulling her toward something important, Baas gave her his blessing.<ref name=\"TOTJC\" /> Baas's Onderon-bound students were successful in their [[Second Battle of Onderon|mission]] and permanently drove the influence of the dark side from the planet.<ref name=\"FNU2\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising'' 2]]</ref> Around the same [[Time/Legends|time]], Baas interviewed a young woman named [[Krynda Draay|Krynda Hulis]], whom he later accepted for apprenticeship.<ref name=\"KOTOR33\">[[Knights of the Old Republic 33|''Knights of the Old Republic'' 33]]</ref> With both Human and Miraluka lineage, Hulis demonstrated exceptional powers of prognostication, and the Krevaaki Master was often inclined to refer to her as the \"[[Eye/Legends|eyes]] of the Jedi.\"<ref name=\"KOTORHB\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Handbook]]''</ref>\n\n===Wayward apprentice===\n{{Quote|Exar Kun, you are the most formidable student I have ever had. But I sense something is missing in you&mdash;an empty place hidden even from yourself, a place that remains unseen because no light escapes from that region of your heart.|Vodo-Siosk Baas|audio=ExarKunEmptyPlace-DLOTS.ogg|Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith (audio)}}\nIn the wake of the events on Onderon, Baas became more vigilant in his quest to prevent the resurgence of the Sith, and he recorded the history of the fallen Jedi&ndash;turned&ndash;Dark [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] Nadd in his [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]], records only intended for access by fellow Jedi Masters. He had since relocated to the barren world of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]],<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" /> where he agreed to serve as the [[Dantooine system/Legends|system's]] [[Jedi Watchman/Legends|Jedi Watchman]], although he ventured back to Ossus from time to time. In a [[Jedi Enclave|dilapidated training compound]] long forsaken prior to Baas's arrival, he established a new environment for students to learn from him the ways of the Jedi.<ref name=\"JATM\" /> Only those destined for Knighthood were trained at the Dantooine academy,<ref name=\"KOTOR2\">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''</ref> and among Baas's new pupils were the [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] mates [[Crado]] and [[Sylvar]], and [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]], a prodigious young Human of exceptional talent in both the Force and with the lightsaber. Relentlessly, Baas drilled them, and Kun, whom Baas quickly recognized as the greatest student he had ever had, regularly bested his classmates in practice combat. Baas noticed that an arrogance had grown in the young Human, as well as a thirst for forbidden knowledge; on one occasion, Kun took the Tedryn Holocron and immersed himself in stories of Freedon Nadd and his fall to the dark side. Baas confiscated the device and admonished his curious student, who was of the opinion that his superior skill in all areas made him eligible for such closely guarded knowledge. The Krevaaki Master rebuked Kun's haughtiness and bade him prove such claims in another lightsaber combat practice session against Crado and Sylvar.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" />\n\n[[File:StickVsSaber-TOTJDLOTS1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Baas duels with Exar Kun.]]\n\nKun dominated his Cathar opponents from the onset of their bout, Crado especially. He next faced Sylvar, with whom he appeared to be evenly matched, until she slashed his face in a fit of rage. Kun retaliated, but Baas intervened and challenged his apprentice, one who thought so highly of himself, to prove his skill against a Master. Armed with a utilitarian [[Master Vodo's quarterstaff|quarterstaff]] that belied its [[Force weapon|Force-augmented]] strength, the Krevaaki Jedi humiliated his overconfident student with relative ease. Kun then retrieved the defeated Crado's lightsaber with which to reengage the Jedi Master; overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught of [[Jar'Kai/Legends|blades wielded in tandem]], Baas was swiftly defeated by Kun, his [[Staff/Legends|staff]] [[Sun djem/Legends|cleaved in two]]. It was then that he sensed a subtle darkness inside of Kun, of which he believed even the young man to be unaware.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\nWhile the dark side had been defeated on Onderon, many [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifacts]] escaped the Inner Rim, taken by individuals eager to continue the practice of [[Sith magic]] elsewhere. By [[3997 BBY]], the [[Empress Teta system/Legends|Empress Teta]] [[Star system/Legends|star system]] had [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|fallen]] under the tyranny of the conquest-driven [[Krath/Legends|Krath]], a [[Sith cult/Legends|cult]] of Sith sorcerers taught by the ghost of Freedon Nadd. Two Jedi who had served on Onderon, [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] and Nomi Sunrider, participated in the Republic's [[Battle of Koros Major|offensive]] against the Krath, but the Republic forces were defeated by the Krath's Force [[Mind trick/Legends#Force illusion|illusions]] and forced to retreat. A [[Conclave at Deneba|conference]] of all members of the Jedi Order was organized on the planet [[Deneba/Legends|Deneba]] in recognition of the threat posed by the new Sith, during which was to be discussed an [[Dark Lord prophecy|age-old prophecy]] that spoke of the return of the Dark Lords of the Sith.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> Baas answered the summons, accompanied by Crado and Sylvar, but not Exar Kun,<ref name=\"DLOTS3\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 3|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 3]]</ref> who had abandoned his apprenticeship in pursuit of long-forgotten Sith lore.<ref name=\"DLOTS2\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 2]]</ref>\n\n===The coming storm===\n{{Quote|I sense that one great power has fallen, and another&hellip; has risen in its place.

He relinquished control of the [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] to Crado and Sylvar as he attempted to draw protective [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side energy]] around his wayward pupil, only to be attacked by the malicious presence of Freedon Nadd, whose spirit had seduced Kun and lashed out at Baas with a potent blast of [[hatred]]. Powerless against the Sith spirit's influence over his student, Baas refrained from further attempts to assist Kun as he and the two Cathar made their way planetside.<ref name=\"DLOTS3\" /> They arrived shortly after a recess had been called, and Baas approached Knights Ulic and [[Cay Qel-Droma]] with inquiries as to the whereabouts of their own Master, Arca Jeth. However, the assembly was [[Battle of Deneba|ambushed]] shortly thereafter by an army of [[Krath war droid/Legends|Krath war droids]] accompanied by planetside [[Service droid/Legends|servant droids]] that had been secretly [[Program trap|reprogrammed]] by the subterfuge of Krath [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] and Tetan [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]], [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal Keto]]. The [[Droid/Legends|automatons]] were ultimately decimated, but not before [[Death/Legends|casualties]] were suffered among the Jedi ranks, Jeth among the most grievous of them. In the battle's aftermath, Baas recorded the day's events in his holocron, as well as details provided by Cay Qel-Droma about the origins of the Krath's [[Battle droid/Legends|war droids]].<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\n[[File:JediAssembly-TotJDLotS6.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vodo-Siosk Baas and the Jedi Assembly give audience to young Knights.]]\nGrief-stricken by the loss of his former Master, Ulic Qel-Droma was determined to [[Mission to Empress Teta|infiltrate]] the Krath in the hopes of orchestrating their destruction from within,<ref name=\"DLOTS3\" /> despite the admonitions of Baas and the conference of Jedi Masters that gathered in the wake of the massacre on Deneba. The Krevaaki Jedi was among those worried about the smoldering anger within Qel-Droma, emotions that Baas had once identified in his own former student&ndash;turned&ndash;[[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] Exar Kun, and emotions he knew led dangerously close to the embrace of the dark side. It was because of the perceived folly in Qel-Droma's plan that Baas, on behalf of the [[Jedi Assembly]], denied the young Human permission to undertake such a dangerous mission. The insubordinate Qel-Droma declared his intention to carry out his plan, irrespective of the orders of the Jedi leadership. Unable to sway the determined Knight from his idea, Baas offered his blessing before he and the Masters departed<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> for Ossus to develop strategy against the Sith threat.<ref name=\"DLOTS6\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 6|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 6]]</ref>\n\nQel-Droma carried out his mission, and over the next several [[Standard month/Legends|months]], Baas and the other Masters of the Jedi Assembly gathered each day in communal [[Meditation/Legends|meditation]] on the Force.<ref name=\"DLOTS6\" /> The months passed without any report of Qel-Droma's progress before a team of Knights ventured to the Tetan [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Empress Teta/Legends|world]] to extract him. Their mission was unsuccessful, as Qel-Droma had been seduced by the very dark side he had desired to conquer, exactly as predicted by Baas.<ref name=\"DLOTS5\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 5|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 5]]</ref> The repelled Knights returned to Ossus in search of guidance from the Jedi Assembly. While many of them felt that Qel-Droma had been beguiled by the powers of the Sith, Baas was among those who cautioned the Knights against attempts to force the Human back toward the light. They approved of another rescue attempt but gave strict instructions not to extract Qel-Droma with force if he refused to leave of his own accord. All felt the despair of Qel-Droma and the sinister triumph of Exar Kun through the Force at that moment, and Baas immediately inferred that both men had been inextricably taken by the power of the dark side. The subsequent [[Second Battle of Empress Teta|rescue attempt]] was indeed refused by Qel-Droma, who drove his comrades from Empress Teta before he joined forces with Kun&mdash;as the [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]] to the new Dark Lord of the Sith,<ref name=\"DLOTS6\" /> with whom he conspired to take over the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\n===The Sith War===\n====Trouble on Coruscant====\n{{Dialogue|Netus|Vodo!

Kun traveled to Ossus in search of recruits for his fledgling [[Sith Empire (Great Sith War)|Sith Empire]], while Qel-Droma supplemented his already formidable Krath armies with the [[Mandalorian Crusaders|warrior clans]] of [[Mandalore the Indomitable]]. As raids against Republic [[Shipyard/Legends|shipyards]] and military installations were reported throughout the galaxy, rumors abounded of a renegade Jedi perpetrator,<ref name=\"TSW1\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War 1|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War'' 1]]</ref> and the Republic's [[Ministry of Defense]] made plans to deal with what they considered to merely be a new terrorist threat. The Masters of the Jedi Order on Ossus, however, were convinced of a certain fallen Jedi's involvement. Accompanied by Knights Shoaneb Culu, Dace Diath, Tott Doneeta, Cay Qel-Droma, Nomi Sunrider, Sylvar, and Qrrrl Toq, Baas went to Coruscant, determined to convince the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] to allow the Jedi to personally handle what they considered to be an internal affair. Baas met with both [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] Sidrona and [[Minister of Defense (Republic)|Minister of Defense]] [[Netus]], the latter of whom had just received a report from [[Republic Navy|Naval]] [[Fleet/Legends|Fleet]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Orley Vanicus]] that confirmed Ulic Qel-Droma's complicity, much to the dismay of the Jedi present.<ref name=\"TSW2\">[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War 2|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Sith War'' 2]]</ref>\n\n[[File:DelusionalUlic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vodo-Siosk Baas leads the Jedi in opposition against Ulic Qel-Droma.]]\nReports suggested that the Sith's next strike would be against the shipyards at the [[Kemplex IX]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]] in the [[Cron system]], and the Republic [[Navy/Legends|Navy]] planned to intercept Qel-Droma's forces there. It dawned on Baas that the actions of Kun and Qel-Droma were indicative of ancient prophecy that foretold the return of the Sith made manifest, and he prepared to confront them both. His departure was halted by the sudden emergence of a battle fleet from [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] into the Coruscant [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]]: the suspected attack on Kemplex IX had been a ruse, and the forces of the Sith had instead [[Battle of Coruscant (Great Sith War)|attacked]] the galactic capital. Priority was placed on Baas's safety as both the Jedi Knights and the Republic forces mounted a hurried defense against the [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]]-bolstered Krath invaders. However, the Krevaaki Master had foreseen that the outcome of the battle would be decided in the war room, and he made haste for the planetary [[Command center|Command Center]]. The Jedi fought their way into the war room and found Qel-Droma inside, using the Force to compel reluctant Republic [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] into his service. With Baas and Nomi Sunrider at the forefront, the Jedi [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] within a temporary [[wall of light]], a [[Force power/Legends|technique]] that effectively blocked a [[Darksider|dark-side Force-user]] from his or her power. Qel-Droma was then placed into the custody of the Republic so that he might stand [[Inquisition (Old Republic)|trial]] for his crimes against [[Sentience/Legends|sapient]] species. His arrest prompted the remaining forces of the Krath, under the leadership of the Sith sorceress [[Aleema Keto]], to retreat from Coruscant while their warlord was left to the mercy of his captors.<ref name=\"TSW2\" />\n\n====Responsibility====\n{{Quote|Not just a military battle for the dominance of a few worlds&mdash;this is a war of light and darkness, and at the center is my own student, ''Exar Kun''.

Even though Qel-Droma's machinations had appeared to be the most destructive, Baas knew that Exar Kun was the true mastermind behind the galactic turmoil, a result of Baas's own failure to recognize the dark ambitions of his former apprentice. The Krevaaki Master reinforced his feeble quarterstaff before he left Dantooine for Coruscant, resigned to the notion of a final confrontation with Kun, which he was certain would occur during Qel-Droma's trial.<ref name=\"TSW3\" />\n\n[[File:Kun_vs_baas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Baas and his former apprentice dueling in the Senate Hall.]]\nOn Coruscant, the unrepentant Qel-Droma responded to Senate accusations against him with pro-Sith rhetoric, and a refusal to acknowledge the lawlessness of his actions as so defined, much to the bewilderment of his present Jedi supporters. Accompanied by [[Mandalore (title)|Mandalore]] the Indomitable and an entourage of [[Massassi/Legends|Massassi]] warriors, Kun then burst into the Senate Hall and [[Q\u00e2zoi Kyantuska|paralyzed]] the gathered senators with a Sith spell as he assumed control of the proceeding. He killed Sidrona moments before Baas arrived, interrupting the outline of Kun's plan to restore a [[Golden Age of the Sith|Golden Age]] of Sith splendor to the galaxy. Baas gave no heed to the Jedi who rose in his defense as he barred the Sith's exit, much to the delight of Kun, who had foreseen the confrontation's necessity in accordance with his planned [[Jedi pogrom|elimination]] of the Jedi leadership. Armed with only his quarterstaff, Baas pleaded with Kun to renounce his dark side practices, but to no avail; the Dark Lord activated his [[Exar Kun's lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], and a [[Duel in the Senate|furious duel]] ensued. When he realized that he was outmatched, Kun disengaged Baas to reveal a modification made to his weapon that produced a [[Color/Legends|blue]] blade from each end.

Although he went without clothing on occasion,<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> Baas was often clad in garments reminiscent of traditional [[Jedi apparel|Jedi attire]]: a dark brown robe, embroidered around the shoulders and adorned with loose-hanging straps fixed to metal rings and buckles, worn over a full-length, long-sleeved, sand-colored tunic, all designed to accommodate the unique physiology of his species.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" /> In his later years, he relied on a wooden quarterstaff to support his gnarled frame,<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" /> but he was yet spry for a being of such advanced age.<ref name=\"TSW3\" /> While Baas dismissed such concerns, his seniority was often ample reason for younger Jedi Knights to defend him in times of imminent danger.<ref name=\"TSW2\" />\n\n[[File:Vodo_baas.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Vodo-Siosk Baas, legendary Jedi Master]]\nVodo-Siosk Baas was a pious warrior in his quest against the forces of the dark side, regardless of their form. His devotion to the Jedi way extended beyond direct confrontation with the enemy to preparation of future Knights for the dark times that he felt were sure to come.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" /> The urgency with which the Krath wrought galactic havoc dismayed him immensely, but he immediately realized the lesser influence of Ulic Qel-Droma's vengeful ambition in the face of Exar Kun's insatiable desire for chaos. Kun's willful defection to the Sith deeply troubled Baas even more, and he harbored considerable guilt for the fall into darkness of what he considered an inadequately trained apprentice on his behalf,<ref name=\"TSW3\" /> blame for which was also laid at his feet by others.<ref name=\"KOTOR33\" /> Still, he felt compelled to help Kun,<ref name=\"TSW3\" /> a sign of foolish naivet\u00e9 according to Freedon Nadd.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> Baas assumed full responsibility for ending the threat posed by his fallen apprentice and resigned himself to whatever outcome resulted from their confrontation.<ref name=\"TSW3\" /> He gained a deeper understanding into the seductive nature of the dark side through his experience with Kun and recorded his findings into the Tedryn Holocron, so that generations to come could benefit from his findings.<ref name=\"DA\" />\n\nBaas was a firm believer in the virtues of the lifelong, never-ending training of a Jedi Knight, and readily imparted measures of wisdom to both the curious and uninterested, indiscriminately.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> Such was the deference conveyed upon him that other Masters often sent their own apprentices to him for further instruction, and Baas could often be seen in the midst of his actively engaged students.<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> He was deeply [[Force empathy|attuned]] to the emotions of others: dejection and misgiving were met with comfort and reassurance;<ref name=\"TOTJC\" /> overconfidence in those with great promise was swiftly admonished; darkness and emptiness were misunderstood&mdash;and pitied.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> Wisdom born of such an illustrious, centuries-long career earned him the respect of Jedi young and old.

However, his staff caved under the pressure of Kun's relentless Jar'Kai onslaught,<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" /> and Baas's unfamiliarity with the Dark Lord's double-bladed lightsaber was reflected by his ineffective usage of his own weapon, an error that resulted in the Jedi Master's death.<ref name=\"TSW3\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nVodo-Siosk Baas first appeared as a holocron gatekeeper in [[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']], the second novel of author [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s [[Star Wars: The Jedi Academy Trilogy|''Jedi Academy Trilogy'']], which was released in [[July]] [[1994]].<ref name=\"DA\" /> A month later, Baas appeared as a supporting character in the [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; The Freedon Nadd Uprising 1|first]] of two issues that comprised the entirety of the [[Tales of the Jedi: The Freedon Nadd Uprising|''Freedon Nadd Uprising'']] [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] story arc. Written by [[Tom Veitch]] and penciled by [[Tony Akins]], the comic was the character's first and only appearance with hair.<ref name=\"FNU1\" /> ''[[Champions of the Force]]'', the third novel in Anderson's ''Jedi Academy Trilogy'', was released in [[September]] of that year and featured the spirit of Baas in a minor protagonist role.<ref name=\"COTF\" /> Baas retained his role as a primary character throughout the ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]'' comic series. The [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith|''Dark Lords of the Sith'']] story arc, a collaboration between Veitch and Anderson,<ref name=\"DLOTS\">''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]''</ref> portrayed Baas as a significant component in the backstory of Exar Kun, a character who debuted in Anderson's ''[[Jedi Search]]'' novel.<ref name=\"Backstory\">In an officially conducted [[Wookieepedia:Interview/Kevin J.

Minor changes were made between versions, including Baas already being present on Deneba when he attempted to assist Exar Kun, in contradiction with [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 3|''Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith'' 3]], which depicted the occurrence of the confrontation while he is still onboard his [[Courier/Legends|courier]] ship. Also different in the audio rendition is Baas's assumption of the entirety of the dialogue of the character Thon, who is not featured at all. Aside from the works in which he actually appeared, Baas was mentioned throughout the remainder of ''The Sith War'' comic series. He was referred to in issues [[Knights of the Old Republic 6|six]], [[Knights of the Old Republic 9|nine]], [[Knights of the Old Republic 18|eighteen]], and [[Knights of the Old Republic 33|thirty-three]] of the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (comic series)|''Knights of the Old Republic'' comic series]], and appeared via other means, though still not alive, in the [[Knights of the Old Republic 32|thirty-second]] and [[Knights of the Old Republic 47|forty-seventh]] issues. He also received minor mentions in the stories [[Knight Errant (novel)|''Knight Errant'']], [[Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine|''The Ruins of Dantooine'']], [[Firestorm (short story)|''Firestorm'']], ''[[I, Jedi]]'', and ''[[Young Jedi Knights: Heirs of the Force]]'', in which a song of him is sung.\n\nBaas's relationships with several other characters from his initial ''Freedon Nadd Uprising'' appearance were expanded upon in the ''[[Tales of the Jedi Companion]]'' [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]] sourcebook by [[West End Games]]. Both the ''[[Power of the Jedi Sourcebook]]'' and the ''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]'' provided significant additions regarding the physical composition of Baas and members of his species, information that was later expanded upon by the ''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]''. In addition to inclusions in an array of source and reference book material, Baas received fleeting acknowledgements in several issues of ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]'', as well as mentions in the [[StarWars.com]] [[Databank (original)|Databank]] entries for both Dantooine and Exar Kun. He was given entries within the ''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' and its [[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia|updated version]], the latter of which erroneously claimed that he created the Tedryn Holocron. A mini-statue of Baas was also included in the [[Star Wars Miniatures: Jedi Academy|''Jedi Academy'']] set of ''[[Star Wars Miniatures]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|width=100%|content=\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Vodo-Siosk Baas|imagecat=Images of Vodo-Siosk Baas}}\n*[[Tales of the Jedi &ndash;
