He was the son of the Wookiee royal [[King/Legends|King]] [[Grakchawwaa/Legends|Grakchawwaa]], and so lived as a [[Prince/Legends|prince]] on his [[Species/Legends|species]]' [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] between the Republic and the separatist [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]], both governments were vying for the favor of Rikummee's father and the Wookiee people. The Confederates quickly became impatient with the indecisive Grakchawwaa, and so dispatched a number of [[Confederate probe droid|hostile battle droids]] to the forests outside of the [[Kashyyyk Royal City|Royal City]]. While on a hunt with his protector [[Ghraggka]] in the [[Western Forest]], Rikummee was shot and [[Death/Legends|killed]] by one of these droids. Upon learning of his son's murder, King Grakchawwaa declared war against the Confederacy and joined the Republic's fight against the invaders.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|Your Highness&mdash;your son&hellip;was killed today in the Western Forest. Killed by Separatist droids.\u00bb''<br />''\u00abMy son&hellip;?|Ghraggka and King Grakchawwaa|Deep Forest}}\nRikummee was a young [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] alive during the final decades of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] reign. He was born to his [[Parent/Legends|father]] [[Grakchawwaa/Legends|Grakchawwaa]], a mighty hunter and an elder Wookiee member of the [[Kashyyyk Royal Families|Royal Families]] that ruled their [[Species/Legends|species]]' [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]]. Grakchawwaa was the recognized [[King/Legends|king]] of Kashyyyk, and as such, Rikummee lived as [[Prince/Legends|prince]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Despite his noble standing, the young Wookiee was rambunctious and adventurous, and thus required a protector during his journeys away from the [[Kashyyyk Royal City|Royal City]]; because his father was preoccupied with matters of state, he named the warrior [[Ghraggka]] as his son's guardian. Rikummee and Ghraggka participated in several hunts together in Kashyyyk's forests, but the younger Wookiee repeatedly found himself in situations of trouble from which Ghraggka had to rescue him.\n\nIn [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], the galaxy exploded into conflict between the long-standing Republic and the separatist [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Around [[21 BBY/Legends|eighteen months after]] the struggle of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] began, Rikummee's father and the Royal Families of Kashyyyk were approached by representatives from the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]]&mdash;one of the Confederacy's major corporate backers. Federation [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]] traveled to the [[Kashyyyk system/Legends|Kashyyyk system]] and planted a Confederate [[Lucrehulk-class battleship|battleship]] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] of the young Wookiee's home planet, hoping to intimidate and entice King Grakchawwaa into an alliance with the Separatists. The king's conflicting loyalties and desires for neutrality made him slow to respond, causing the [[Neimoidian/Legends|Neimoidian]] and his superiors quickly became impatient. To expedite Royal's deliberations, the Federation dispatched [[Confederate probe droid|hostile battle droids]] to the planet's surface.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|Immodesty is unbecoming, Prince.\u00bb''<br />''\u00abImmodesty? It's not that&hellip; it's honesty! And when I become King, all will tell stories of my many incredible hunts!\u00bb''<br />''\u00abWhatever you say, Prince.|Ghragggka and Rikummee|Deep Forest}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlthough King Grakchawwaa undeniably dominated the council which decided on what course of action Kashyyyk should take in the Clone Wars, the same story, ''[[Deep Forest]]'', makes clear that there were multiple [[Kashyyyk Royal Families]]. It is thus unclear exactly what sort of status the royal titles of the King and his son denote.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Deep Forest]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Rikummee\n|pl=Rikummee\n}}\n\n[[Category:Kashyyyk residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
