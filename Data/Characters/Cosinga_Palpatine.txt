How would you know what's good for me? Have you ever even cared?|Palpatine to his father|Darth Plagueis (novel)}}\n'''Cosinga Palpatine''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Noble/Legends|aristocrat]] and the patriarch of [[Imperial family|House Palpatine]], one of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo's]] [[Royal House of Naboo/Legends|noble families]]. A violent man who was regarded by his [[Palpatine/Legends|firstborn son]] as both grossly inept and disproportionately arrogant, Cosinga spent a considerable amount of time and [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] attempting to buy both political influence and his son's obedience.\n\nOut of a minimum of five children that he and his [[Palpatine's mother|wife]] produced, Cosinga hated his eldest son, but approved of his [[Palpatine's first brother|other]] [[Palpatine's second brother|four sons]] [[Palpatine's first sister|and]] [[Palpatine's second sister|daughter]]. Unlike their father's wayward heir, the younger Palpatines were subservient to Cosinga's will; something their older brother refused to be. Ultimately, the younger Palpatine took his father's life in an act of rage in [[65 BBY/Legends|65 BBY]], using the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]] him along with his mother, his siblings, and several of the family's [[Bodyguard/Legends|bodyguards]]. His son would soon become Darth Sidious, [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], and later [[Senator/Legends|Senator]], [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] and [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]].\n\n==Biography==\n===The Palpatines===\n{{Quote|The reason I don't respect him is because he's not half as intelligent as he thinks he is. If he could admit to his own weaknesses, I could at least pity him.|Palpatine, to Hego Damask|Darth Plagueis (novel)}}\nLike [[Gender/Legends|his]] forefathers, Cosinga Palpatine was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] into the ancient, aristocratic dynasty of the [[Imperial family|Palpatines]], one of the [[Royal House of Naboo/Legends|Royal Houses]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. As a young man, Cosinga frequently stood on the balcony of the family's [[Lake Country/Legends|Lake Country]] [[Convergence (Naboo)/Legends|villa]] and surveyed the estate's vast grounds, reveling at the sight of all that he stood to inherit. [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], his eldest son, regarded this as a testament to Cosinga's mediocrity, as the only thing his father would ever be [[master]] of was that which was already owned by right of birth. This stood in stark contrast to Cosinga's ambitious heir, who would strive to, and ultimately succeed in, [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|dominating]] the entire [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nCosinga's relationship with his family was uneasy at best. The elder Palpatine's [[Palpatine's mother|wife]] and [[Palpatine's siblings|younger children]] were completely subservient to him, even to the point of having no opinions of their own. The only one in his family whom he could not exert his will over as easily was Palpatine. Cosinga was constantly at odds with his firstborn son and heir. The younger Palpatine proved to be a rebellious youth with a penchant for mischief. His father thus used a considerable amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to protect the family from any scandal that Palpatine nearly caused on many occasions with his numerous run-ins with the law.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nAt one point, Cosinga purchased an expensive [[Palpatine's prototype patrol-grade Flash|prototype patrol-grade Flash]] [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]], which his son interpreted as a bribe. Due to his passion for flying, however, Palpatine accepted the vehicle. Despite the pride he came to feel for the speeder, the \"gift\" failed to eliminate&mdash;or even soften&mdash;the hatred that Palpatine harbored toward his father. Cosinga later forbade Palpatine from flying after the latter inadvertently [[Death/Legends|killed]] two pedestrians, only to reconsider his decision because of his son's defiance against parental authority. Their mutual resentment continued to grow for years following the incident, and Cosinga refused to fly with Palpatine ever again.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nCosinga Palpatine and his eldest son attended two coronations in [[Theed/Legends|Theed]]. Years later, Palpatine the younger distinctly remembered his father's envy of the monarch's power and influence. But whereas Cosinga dreamed of wielding power over Naboo in his son's eyes,<ref name=\"Darth P\" /> Palpatine settled for nothing less than absolute power over the galaxy.<ref name=\"EpisodeIII\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\n===Patricide===\n{{Quote|I was born mature, Father, fully grown, and you hated me for it, because you grasped that I was everything you can never be.''\"<br />\"''Hated you more than you know. Enough to want to kill you from the start.''\"<br />\"''Then you had better do it now.|Palpatine the son and Cosinga Palpatine|Darth Plagueis (novel)}}\nBy [[65 BBY/Legends|65 BBY]], Cosinga Palpatine was a member of the faction that opposed Naboo's full integration into the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. During the upcoming election for the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] next [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|monarch]], Cosinga and his political allies opposed [[Bon Tapalo/Legends|Bon Tapalo]], a candidate whose platform included the promise of integrating the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|people of Naboo]] as full members of the Republic. However, Palpatine believed that his father's support of Tapalo's [[Bon Tapalo's opponent|opponent]] was motivated by more personal interests rather than the overall good of Naboo. According to Palpatine the son, Cosinga was having an affair with the [[Cosinga Palpatine's mistress|sister]] of Tapalo's rival. Thus, Cosinga sought to elevate himself to a position of power in the government once the brother of his mistress became king; an undeserved position from Palpatine's eyes.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nThe young Palpatine developed a sense of pro-unification between Naboo and the Republic as a way of further spiting his father. Without Cosinga's knowledge, he discreetly supplied valuable information to Tapalo's campaign, an act which gained the notice of [[Darth Plagueis/Legends|Darth Plagueis]], a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] who masqueraded in public as [[Magister]] Hego Damask, owner of [[Damask Holdings/Legends|Damask Holdings]].<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nCosinga disapproved of the friendship that his son had forged with Damask. But by attempting to separate Palpatine from Damask's influence, as well as his confirming Palpatine's suspicions that Cosinga, mutual to his son's own patricidal feelings for him, harbored a murderous hatred of the boy due to the fact that his son had been \"born mature\" and thus outranked his father in every way, Cosinga inadvertently caused his son to draw upon his [[Force-sensitive/Legends|hidden connection to]] [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], particularly the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. Consumed by rage and years of repressed patricidal feelings, Palpatine used the Force to violently smash his father's skull against the ship's bulkhead. He then proceeded to slaughter everyone aboard.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nThe truth behind the deaths of Cosinga Palpatine and his family was disguised as a tragic accident by Plagueis, who then claimed the orphaned Palpatine as his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]], thus renaming him \"[[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Sidious\" in secret.<ref name=\"Darth P\" /> Cosinga's son ultimately went on to become the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] who brought about the [[Order 66/Legends|downfall]] of the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the Republic, becoming [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] of the first [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]].<ref name=\"EpisodeIII\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|How cravenly [my] inept father had desired to wield such power!|Palpatine|Darth Plagueis (novel)}}\nCosinga Palpatine was an arrogant man, and not nearly as intelligent as he believed, according to his eldest son. Though not lacking in ambition, Cosinga had a mediocre desire for power, possessing no apparent desire to advance beyond his station as a privileged aristocrat, although the younger Palpatine did note that Cosinga had a particular envy towards the power wielded by that of the Naboo monarch. Part of the younger Palpatine's resentment stemmed from his observation of how his father lacked the political savvy necessary to increase House Palpatine to a position of true entitlement and greater wealth. Much to his son's disgust, Cosinga believed he already had all the power and influence that could be obtained. Palpatine, in what ultimately turned out to be their final argument, also implied that Cosinga was a prolific liar, as he called the latter the \"father of lies.\"<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nAs a husband and father, Cosinga Palpatine was feared by his wife and younger children, but utterly despised by his eldest son. One of the few traits the elder and younger Palpatine had in common, other than a thirst for violence, was a fanatical passion for [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] [[racing]]. His political views were conservative and pro-isolationist. Hence, he agreed with then-[[Senator/Legends|senatorial]] [[Aide/Legends|aide]] [[Vidar Kim]] on the prospect of maintaining Naboo's state of semi-independence from the Republic in order to prevent their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld's]] [[Plasma/Legends|plasma]] reserves from being exploited by corporate entities.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nSimilar to how his own son hated him, Cosinga in turn hated his eldest son, enough that he even admitted immediately prior to his death that he was willing to kill his son right from the start, and would have done so at Palpatine's goading had the latter not killed him first. Largely because of his hatred of his son, he also held doubts that he was even related to him, making Palpatine take a paternity test at least once to make sure he was indeed his son. Even in the few instances where Cosinga bailed his son out of punishment from the law, it was solely to protect his family from the inevitable scandal that would arise from the eldest son getting in trouble with the law and not out of any genuine concern for his son's well being.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\nDespite being married, Cosinga pursued an extra-marital affair with [[Cosinga Palpatine's mistress|his mistress]]. She was also the sister of [[Bon Tapalo's opponent|Bon Tapalo's chief rival for the monarchy]]. His son suspected that Cosinga was taking advantage of his affair in order to attain a position of power in the government should Tapalo's opponent win the election.<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCosinga Palpatine was first introduced in the novel [[Darth Plagueis (novel)|''Darth Plagueis'']]. The creation of his character, along with those of his [[Palpatine's mother|wife]] and his other sons and daughters, provided a considerable amount of detail to the once-obscure origins of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]].<ref name=\"Darth P\" />\n\n[[Cos Dashit|''Cos'' Dashit]] was the original name of the Emperor (then also \"[[Lord/Legends|Lord]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]\" and \"[[Consul to the Supreme Tribunal]]\") in the [[The Star Wars: Rough Draft|rough draft]] of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'']].
