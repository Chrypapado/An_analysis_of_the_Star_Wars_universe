If there's anything you need, let me know.|Vek Drow, to Qui-Gon Jinn|audio=VekDrow.ogg|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)}}\n'''Vek Drow''' was an [[Ishi Tib/Legends|Ishi Tib]] merchant in [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] during the time of the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]], whose shop was rescued from a robbery by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], who, while searching for a [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] generator among the vendors, spotted Drow being attacked. Jinn swiftly defeated the two [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] thugs accosting Drow and was, in turn, given [[Energy binder/Legends|energy binders]] when Jinn needed them to trade for parts that [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] needed to fix [[Anakin Skywalker's Podracer/Legends|his podracer]] in time for the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing/Legends|podrace]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAfter Drow gives the player the energy binders, he doesn't want to talk to Jinn again. Whenever the player tries to interact with Drow, he says he already gave the energy binders to Jinn. The player must acquire parts to repair the [[Podracer/Legends|podracer]] by completing side quests.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Unknown Regions]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vek Drow\n|nl=Vek Drow\n|ru=\u0412\u0435\u043a \u0414\u0440\u043e\n}}\n\n[[Category:Ishi Tib|Drow, Vek]]\n[[Category:Males|Drow, Vek]]\n[[Category:Merchants|Drow, Vek]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians|Drow, Vek]]"}}}]}}}}
