A [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]], MacMillian was a member of the [[Corellian Merchants' Guild/Legends|Corellian Merchants' Guild]], and at some point earned a [[Corellian Bloodstripe]]. MacMillian retired to [[Gandle Ott]], a world in the [[Kathol sector]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], where she maintained the local Corellian Merchants' Guild [[Corellian Merchants' Guild Guildhouse (Gandle Ott)|Guildhouse]] and possessed a large amount of navigational data regarding the Kathol [[Sector/Legends|sector]].\n\n==Biography==\nA native of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], Brandy MacMillian was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|woman]] who plied her trade as a [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] [[Captain/Legends|captain]]. At some point during her life, she earned the [[Corellian Bloodstripe]] and joined the [[Corellian Merchants' Guild/Legends|Corellian Merchants' Guild]]. After many years as a freighter captain, MacMillian eventually decided to retire; she chose to settle on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Gandle Ott]], a remote world located in the [[Kathol sector]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. On Gandle Ott, MacMillian maintained a small Corellian Merchants' Guild [[Corellian Merchants' Guild Guildhouse (Gandle Ott)|Guildhouse]].<ref name=\"DIRP\" />\n\nDuring her time as head of the Guildhouse, MacMillian amassed a large amount of navigational information regarding the Kathol [[Sector/Legends|sector]] and was willing to copy it for members of the Corellian Merchants' Guild for a fee of 100 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. In [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[FarStar]]'' stopped over at Gandle Ott while on a mission to track down the rogue [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Kentor Sarne]]. The crew of the ''FarStar'' was in need of navigational charts of the sector, as Moff Sarne had wiped the records on the sector [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Kal'Shebbol/Legends|Kal'Shebbol]] clean during his [[Battle of Kal'Shebbol|withdrawal]], and the crew only had access to partial maps that did not show details beyond Gandle Ott. During their layover, MacMillian was one of the potential sources from which they considered obtaining the information.<ref name=\"DIRP\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBy 8 ABY, MacMillian was an aged woman, with salty hair and wrinkles covering her face. She possessed a no-nonsense attitude, and the Corellian Bloodstripe that she had earned proved her tenacity, displaying the fact that she was not a woman to cross. She acted friendly toward fellow Corellians, especially those allied with the New Republic, as she believed that the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government was capable of restoring peace to the galaxy.<ref name=\"DIRP\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBrandy MacMillian was first mentioned in ''[[Death Is Remotely Possible]]'', a [[roleplaying game]] adventure in ''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]'' published by [[West End Games]] as a possible source of astrogation charts that the player characters could acquire to continue their adventure. She later received an entry in [[2008]]'s ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\nMacMillian's character does not have to be encountered in the adventure; the main aim of the players is to acquire navigational data and the adventure provides several ways for the players to obtain it. MacMillian is only one of several options, and her participation in the scenario is dependent on the player's actions.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{DarkStryder|Death Is Remotely Possible|The DarkStryder Campaign}} {{1stm}}\n*{{DarkStryder|Shintel Downtime|The DarkStryder Campaign}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The DarkStryder Campaign]]''\n*''[[The DarkStryder Campaign, Deluxe]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MacMillian, Brandy}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]"}}}]}}}}
