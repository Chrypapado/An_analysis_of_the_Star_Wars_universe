A member of the [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] [[Species/Legends|species]], he was born on the [[Cathar/Legends|planet of the same name]], but was raised on the arid [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Rho hated the planet, and he was unable to find honest work in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. During the early years of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], he spent most of his time in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Cantina]], drinking away his worries.\n\nWhen the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] won the Battle of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]] and [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] [[Death/Legends|died]], Rho joined in the [[City/Legends|city]]-wide celebration in Mos Eisley. He later learned that [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], a hero of the Alliance, had originally hailed from Tatooine; inspired by the plays performed at the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] by [[Cebann Veekan]] and [[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena]], Rho decided to start the \"Skywalker Tour.\" Rho's tour took visitors to pivotal locations in Skywalker's life, such as the [[Lars homestead]] and the [[Great Pit of Carkoon/Legends|Great Pit of Carkoon]]. This venture was short-lived, however, as Rho encountered difficulties from [[B'omarr Order/Legends|B'omarr Monks]] and [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and lack of career===\nBorn on [[Cathar/Legends|Cathar]] but raised on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], Myhr Rho had aspired to own and run a successful business since he was a cub. However, the remoteness of Tatooine made it difficult for him to find employment. Most of the operations conducted on Tatooine were of an illegal nature, and Rho sought to avoid such avenues as much as possible. He had always hated his adopted [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]; the heat of the planet's [[Binary star/Legends|twin suns]], [[Tatoo I/Legends|Tatoo I]] and [[Tatoo II/Legends|Tatoo II]], forced him to cut his [[Cathar (species)/Legends|Cathar]] mane short so that he would not overheat. Additionally, Rho found the light on the planet uncomfortable, as Cathar were naturally nocturnal.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nRho tried to save money for passage off Tatooine, but he continued to spend the accumulated funds on temporary comforts. Eventually, he began spending most of his time in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Cantina]], in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]].<ref name=\"db\" /> In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Rho was present in the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] when a meeting between the patron [[Krelman]] and [[Bartender/Legends|bartender]] [[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena]] was broadcast to other [[Star system/Legends|systems]]. During the broadcast, the cantina's [[wallscreen]] displayed a message from an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] officer, announcing a curfew due to recent [[Spy/Legends|spy]] activity. The curfew forced all present, Rho included, to depart the cantina and return home, but Rho and his fellow patrons refused to leave. Ackmena attempted to get her customers to return to their homes, but they would not cooperate. Rho and the other patrons began vehemently protesting, prompting Ackmena to offer a free round of drinks on the house. The bartender then began singing; during her routine, Rho lurched toward her, attempting to embrace her. In response, Ackmena placed Rho in the custody of the bouncer, [[Tork]], who ejected the unruly Cathar from the establishment.<ref name=\"hs\">''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"nec\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> news of [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] first [[Death/Legends|death]] at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] reached Mos Eisley, changing Rho's outlook to a more optimistic one. Celebrations in Mos Eisley continued for weeks after the battle, and Rho began thinking of ways in which he could take advantage of the new level of freedom the denizens of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] were presented under the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===The Skywalker Tour===\nMuch to his surprise, Rho learned that [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], a prominent figure in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], and often heralded as a hero, had originally hailed from Tatooine. At [[Chalmun/Legends|Chalmun's]] Cantina, Rho was inspired by the plays performed by [[Actor/Legends|actor]] [[Cebann Veekan]] and Ackmena based on the exploits of Skywalker, and the Cathar decided to put all of his resources into researching the Alliance hero, particularly his life on Tatooine. Realizing that he could turn a profit from his research, he deduced that once the adventures of Luke Skywalker became more widely known, people would become curious about what he had done while on Tatooine. With what little money he had left, Rho purchased a [[Sail barge/Legends|sail barge]] and started what he called the \"[[Skywalker Tour]].\"<ref name=\"db\" /><ref name=\"tc\">''[[Star Wars Technical Journal of the Planet Tatooine]]''</ref>\n\nThe tour entailed trips to key places in Skywalker's life on Tatooine, specifically: the location where [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2's]] [[Tantive IV/Legends|''Tantive IV'']] [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] crashed in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], the [[Lars homestead]], and [[Ben Kenobi's hut]], which the Cathar had restored. Rho eventually added [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] and the [[Great Pit of Carkoon/Legends|Great Pit of Carkoon]] to the itinerary. In [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba's]] Palace, Rho hung a replica of the [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] block that had held [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] in 4 ABY. The tour, which ran daily, was initially a great success for Rho,<ref name=\"tc\" /> and he eventually came to believe that Tatooine wasn't as bad as he had originally thought.<ref name=\"db\" /> However, Rho soon ran into trouble from both the [[B'omarr Order/Legends|B'omarr Monks]] that occupied Jabba's Palace, who resented his tour's intrusion into their contemplative silence, and [[Tusken Raider/Legends|Tusken Raiders]] that reacted violently to his excursions near Kenobi's hut. These complications combined to have Rho end the Skywalker Tour.<ref name=\"Vehicle\">''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 26]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nMyhr Rho, an enterprising and charming man,<ref name=\"tc\" /> always aspired to reach loftier heights than the ones given to him as a cub, although his home planet of Tatooine provided scant opportunity for enterprise. He did not want to be involved with anything remotely violent or dangerous, but unfortunately for Rho, most of the jobs on Tatooine involved both. In the wake of the Battle of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], however, Rho's enterprising came to the fore, and he took advantage of Luke Skywalker's fame,<ref name=\"db\" /> until complications led to the canceling of his enterprise.<ref name=\"Vehicle\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of \"Myhr\" was first mentioned in the first volume of the [[Star Wars Technical Journal of the Planet Tatooine|''Star Wars Technical Journal'']], published in [[1993]]. The character was described as an \"enterprising, catlike fellow\" and was identified as the owner of the \"Skywalker Tour.\" Myhr would go unused in [[canon]] for thirteen years, until [[2006]], when [[Benjamin Christopher Norton Dawe]] retroactively consolidated him with a character from ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' through the [[StarWars.com]] [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature, \"[[What's The Story?]]\"<ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|Yossarian|1|Myhr Rho - Behind the Scenes|Captain Yossarian's Super Happy Fun Place|Benjamin Christopher Norton Dawe|archivedate=20081014181156}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lionman.jpg|thumb|left|Myhr Rho in ''Star Wars: Yoda Stories'']]\nThe ''Holiday Special'' character had originally been dubbed \"Lion Man\" during the production of the show. While most actors playing [[Alien/Legends|aliens]] in the show had been wearing flexible masks, both the actor playing \"Lion Man\" and the one playing \"Baboon Man\" (later identified as Cebann Veekan) had to wear heavy makeup, which had been designed by [[Rick Baker]]. The actor underwent a lengthy, two-hour-long process of having the makeup applied, and suffered from the heat of the lighting on the 24-hour-long shoot of the show's \"Cantina scene.\"<ref name=\"Starlog\">[[Wikipedia:Starlog|Starlog]] Number 19, February 1979: \"\"Star Wars\" Invades TV\"</ref> The \"Lion Man\" also appeared sporadically and randomly in the non-canon [[Video game|game]] ''[[Star Wars: Yoda Stories]]''. In 2006, the \"Lion Man\" was used in the \"What's the Story?\" feature, and Dawe, noting the character's catlike appearance, remembered Myhr from the ''Technical Journal''.<ref name=\"blog\" />\n\nGiving the character the surname of \"Rho,\" Dawe applied Myhr's name and story to the \"Lion Man,\" effectively consolidating the two characters. He originally identified Rho as a member of a completely new catlike species, but in the editorial process, StarWars.com staff changed the new species to the established one of Cathar, from [[1994]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]''. StarWars.com staff also added a reference to the character of Cebann Veekan, who had been simultaneously developed through the \"What's the Story?\" program.<ref name=\"blog\" />\n\nFollowing these developments, Rho was also mentioned in ''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 26]]'', published by [[De Agostini|DeAgostini]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' {{1st}} {{Ret}}\n\n===Non-canon appearances===\n*''[[Star Wars: Yoda Stories]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Technical Journal of the Planet Tatooine]]'' {{C|First mentioned before retcon}} {{1stID|Myhr}}\n*''[[Star Wars Technical Journal]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]'' {{Po}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Official Starships & Vehicles Collection 26]]''\n*{{DB|location|benkenobishome|Ben Kenobi's hut|archivedate=20100326062535}}\n*{{DB|character|myhrrho|Rho, Myhr|archivedate=20100209231625}} {{1stID|Rho}}\n*{{InsiderCite|144|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: You're Barred!}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-holiday-special-cantina-we-may-not-thrive-friend-but-we-survive-friend|text=''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' Cantina: Who's Who|int=The Star Wars Holiday Special Cantina: Who's Who}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Blog|Yossarian|1|Myhr Rho - Behind the Scenes|Captain Yossarian's Super Happy Fun Place|Benjamin Christopher Norton Dawe|archivedate=20081014181156}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Myhr Rho\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rho, Myhr}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Cathar]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
