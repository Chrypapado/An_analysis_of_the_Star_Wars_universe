He then legally assumed the name after an impressive debut with good fan reaction. His speeders, [[Swoop/Legends|swoops]], and [[Podracer/Legends|podracers]] were customized for his small stature. Touring widely, Zip ended his professional career at [[Boonta Speeder Race|Boonta]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], when he caused a multi-speeder pileup during a championship race. Retiring in disgrace to Coruscant, Zip acquired newfound fame and notoriety in the illegal podraces, [[Pit racing|garbage pit races]], and swoop rallies of the [[Undercity (Taris)|Undercity]]. Even in the illegal races, Zip was known as an honest competitor who never resorted to sabotage or cheating. He was known to post low times after indulging in [[Corellia/Legends|Corellian]] [[Lum/Legends|lum]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beeline, Zip}}\n[[Category:Drall]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Podracers]]"}}}]}}}}
