In the [[Standard year|year]] [[5 ABY]], she attended a meeting to discuss her peoples' future on board the flotilla's [[Alderaanian escort frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' while the flotilla was floating amongst the remains of Alderaan in the [[Alderaan system]]. At the meeting, Valmor argued that the flotilla should remain where their home had once been, while others argued that they should leave to resettle another world. The argument ended when several [[New Republic]] vessels arrived in the system to deliver the remains of the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]], which Valmor declared could be used to build a new [[space station]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|We could build a whole space station of our own.|Valmor begins making plans for the Death Star remains|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\nEglyn Valmor was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] native of the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]] who survived the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of her [[homeworld]] by the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> in the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]].<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' establishes that the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]] occurs in [[0 BBY]].</ref> Following Alderaan's destruction, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of Alderaan and the [[Rebel pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] gathered together the surviving [[Alderaanian]]s and formed the [[Alderaan Flotilla]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nBy the year [[5 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date\">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> Valmor had been elected as [[regent Administrator]] of the flotilla, the [[starship]]s of which were positioned amongst the remains of Alderaan in the [[Alderaan system]]. Valmor attended a meeting on board the [[Alderaanian escort frigate]] ''[[Sunspire]]'' to discuss the future of the flotilla where she argued that they should remain where their homeworld had once been. Others at the meeting including the former [[teacher]] [[Icar Orliss]] claimed that they should instead find a new world to settle on.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nThis argument continued until Valmor and the others were made aware of the arrival of several [[New Republic]] vessels in the Alderaan [[Star system|system]] by [[communications officer]] [[Rickert Beagle]]. The vessels were hauling the remains of the Death Star with them, as Organa and Verlaine had worked with flotilla member [[Teven Gale]] to secure them as a resource for the Alderaanians. The regent administrator was initially shocked, but then stated they should use the remains to forge a [[space station]] of their own. Orliss still disagreed, but others began to concur with her plan.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|This is our home. ''This'' patch of sky is ours. Our world was here.

Teven Gale considered her young, but believed she possessed vital [[heart]]. She was extremely pleased about the flotilla coming to possess the Death Star wreckage, staring at it with child-like wonderment.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nEglyn Valmor first appeared in the novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', which was written by [[Chuck Wendig]]<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> and released released on [[July 12]], [[2016]].<ref name=\"Penguin-eBook\">{{Penguin|books/531277/life-debt-aftermath-star-wars-by-chuck-wendig/9781101966945|Life Debt: Aftermath (Star Wars)|https://web.archive.org/web/20170509143435/http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/531277/life-debt-aftermath-star-wars-by-chuck-wendig/9781101966945}} {{C|eBook}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Eglyn Valmor\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Valmor, Eglyn}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
