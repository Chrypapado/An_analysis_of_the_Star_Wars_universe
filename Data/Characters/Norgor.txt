In [[3997 BBY]], a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] named [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] [[Mission to Empress Teta|came]] to the [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]] [[Star system/Legends|system]], claiming to want to join the Ketos' [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]], the [[Krath/Legends|Krath]]. However, Satal Keto was mistrustful of Qel-Droma, [[Prison/Legends|imprisoning]] him and injecting him with a [[Sith poison]], an act which forced Norgor and Aleema Keto to bring the unconscious [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] to Aleema's chambers to give him a place to rest. Later, after Satal found a [[Hologram/Legends|transmission]] from Qel-Droma to some fellow Jedi professing he was there to break the Krath's power, the Krath leader ordered Norgor to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] the Jedi Knight. Norgor struck when Qel-Droma was in Aleema's bedchambers, jumping in through the [[Window/Legends|window]] with two [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] [[Laser/Legends|firing]]. However, Norgor was [[Death/Legends|cut down]] by the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]-wielding Qel-Droma.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Norgor&hellip;have the ''Jedi woman'' brought to me&hellip;send twenty men&hellip;she is ''very'' powerful.

In [[3997 BBY]], a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] named [[Ulic Qel-Droma/Legends|Ulic Qel-Droma]] came to [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]], and was promptly [[Prison/Legends|imprisoned]] by Satal in the Krath headquarters, the [[Iron Citadel/Legends|Iron Citadel]]. Satal was mistrustful of Qel-Droma, who claimed he wanted to join the Krath, and injected him with a [[Sith poison]] despite Aleema's objections. The [[Poison/Legends|poison]] sapped the strength and consciousness out of Qel-Droma, nearly [[Death/Legends|killing]] him; however, Aleema, who had planned to manipulate Qel-Droma into turning to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], called off Satal and ordered Norgor to help her bring the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] to her chambers. Satal's mistrust of Ulic Qel-Droma was only exacerbated when a group of Jedi, led by [[Nomi Sunrider]], came to the Iron Citadel in an [[Mission to Empress Teta|attempt]] to bring him back to the Republic, although Qel-Droma refused to go with Sunrider. Satal later saw a message from Qel-Droma to Sunrider explaining that he needed to break the Krath's power; infuriated, Satal ordered Norgor to send a [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of twenty men to apprehend Sunrider, and commanded him to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] Qel-Droma, instructing him to ignore all protests from Aleema. Norgor struck when Qel-Droma was in Aleema's bedchamber, jumping through the [[Window/Legends|window]] with two [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] [[Laser/Legends|blazing]]. However, he failed to hit his target, and the Jedi killed Norgor with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"darklords5\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNorgor was unflinchingly loyal to the Ketos, particularly to Satal. He obeyed Lord Keto's orders without question, even when the potential result was Norgor's own death. During his attempted assassination of Ulic Qel-Droma, Norgor displayed a measure of boldness, forgoing any thought of subterfuge and stealth in favor of simply jumping through the window.<ref name=\"darklords5\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nNorgor made his first and only appearance in ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith]]'', a story arc of the ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and [[Tom Veitch]] and released from late [[1994]] to early [[1995]]. Norgor made his sole appearance in the arc's [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 5|fifth issue]], where he was later killed. In this appearance, he was illustrated by [[Chris Gossett]].
