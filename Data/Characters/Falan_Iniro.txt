He and his gunner, [[Gadaf]], were part of the [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]]' First Strike Element in the [[YT-1210 light freighter/Legends|YT-1210]] [[Light freighter/Legends|light freighter]], ''[[Take That!]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nAlong with the other members of the First Strike Element, he lay hidden among the space-debris that surrounded [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], waiting for [[Mako Spince]]'s order to ambush the [[Carrack-class light cruiser/Legends|''Carrack''-class light cruiser]] ''[[Renthal's Vigilance]]'', that was beginning to search the debris field. Mako transmitted the order, \"Prepare to evade,\" to all members of the First Strike Element. Unfortunately, a few members of the element misunderstood him to say, \"Prepare to engage,\" causing them to jump the gun and attack the Carrack. Falan Iniro was among those smugglers. He barely had time to destroy a [[TIE/LN starfighter]] before he was face-to-face with the ''Vigilance'', at which point its [[Turbolaser/Legends|turbolasers]] lashed out and destroyed ''Take That!'' and all aboard.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Hutt Gambit]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Falan Iniro\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iniro, Falan}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
