She was the granddaughter of the then village chief, and had a sister called [[Saku]].<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Biography==\nLocal raider [[Lord]] [[Izuma]], who took over much of the deserted [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] arsenal on Keelia, at one point demanded her grandfather as collateral to avoid unnecessary conflict with the villagers. Haru and her [[Marriage|bridegroom]] [[Asu]] both volunteered to go in his stead, despite repeated protests from Haru's sister, [[Saku]]. Haru and Asu's [[Wedding of Asu and Haru|wedding ceremony]] took place the night before they were to be taken.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\nOn the day following the wedding, Haru and Asu turned themselves in to Izuma. Saku and others had secretly organized an ambush on the raiders, but their plans were foiled. When Izuma was ready to execute Saku for being the leader, the [[Jedi]] [[F]] intervened and saved her. F's companion [[Valco]] destroyed Izuma's ship, thus disabling his [[B1-series battle droid]]s. In the ensuing chaos, Izuma's associates fled. Izuma then took Haru as hostage. In a swift move, F struck down the raider, and saved Haru and the rest of the villagers.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\nSometime later, Haru and the rest of the villagers thanked F for her help, and said their farewell to F as the Jedi left the planet.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:HaruConceptArt-SWVisions.png|thumb|Haru concept art]]\nHaru first appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: Visions]]'' short film \"[[The Village Bride]].\" She was voiced by [[Megumi Han]] in the original Japanese audio, and by [[Nichole Sakura]] in the English dub.<ref name=\"Bride\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{VisionsCite|The Village Bride}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SW|url=news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast|text=Stunning New ''Star Wars: Visions'' Trailer Debuts}} {{1stm}}\n*{{SW|url=series/star-wars-visions/episode-guide-the-village-bride|text=Star Wars: Visions {{!}} \"The Village Bride\" Episode Guide}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Keelia residents]]"}}}]}}}}
