When the Sith Empire began to [[Battle of Corellia|invade]] his [[Planet/Legends|planet]], he became one of many Corellians who put his past experience to work in the resistance movement.\n\nIn [[3640 BBY]], he welcomed [[Havoc Squad]] that came to aid in reclaiming Corellia from the Empire.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGood-natured and swaggering in the Corellian way, Locke was a passionate defender of his world and people. When the Empire invaded, he welcomed the [[Republic Military/Legends|Republic Military's]] aid reclaiming his homeworld, but had a dim view of the rampant property destruction being inflicted by the non-native troops.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Republic Special Forces personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
