IT-31 returned to Tien Tubb.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAs a [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] or Neutral character, the player could either purchase IT-31, or persuade Kodin to give him up. As a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] character, the player could rip out & purchase IT-31's memory core, killing the droid. Alternatively, the player could always threaten or kill Kodin instead of paying or persuading. However, both acts lead to unfavorable outcomes--the former will be despised by T3-M4, while the latter will result in him closing his shop to the player.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=IT-31\n|es=IT-31\n|fr=IT-31\n|pt=IT-31\n}}\n\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Utility droids]]"}}}]}}}}
