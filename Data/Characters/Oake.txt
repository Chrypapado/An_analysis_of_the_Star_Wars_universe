A member of the [[1st Platoon]], Oake became a mercenary operating on [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nOake was one of the millions of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] created on the aquatic [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]] for the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]], being trained for years as a standard trooper. During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Oake served as medic of the [[1st Platoon]] before being retired by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] from active duty. Making off with caches of armor and weaponry, Oake and other platoon members fled to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] where they operated as a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] group. Basing their operations on [[Saleucami/Legends|Saleucami]] within [[Blackwind Crater]], Oake and the Platoon were hired as the long-term guards of the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority's]] base of operations in the crater. Because of the accelerated age of the clone army, Oake was physically closer to the age of seventy or eighty than to his chronological age of forty. When the last of the Platoon's gunners died, Oake was forced into the role to fill the vacancy. Tending to his ailing brothers using what little supplies the Sorority had given him, Oake was willing to reach out to other groups if it meant saving his brothers from going untreated. Carrying a [[light repeating blaster]], [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], [[vibroknife]], and worn armor, all standard issue from their time in the Grand Army, Oake's hearing had begun to diminish. By the time of the Sorority's conflict with the [[Zann Consortium/Legends|Zann Consortium]], only four others were still alive out of the original twenty-seven troopers that survived the Clone Wars. Oake was joined by [[Zeke (clone trooper)|Zeke]], [[Jayk (clone trooper)|Jayk]], [[Rafe (clone trooper)|Rafe]], and [[Tojo]].<ref name=\"MPQ\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mask of the Pirate Queen]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Clone trooper medics]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Saleucamians]]\n[[Category:Veiled Sorority members]]"}}}]}}}}
