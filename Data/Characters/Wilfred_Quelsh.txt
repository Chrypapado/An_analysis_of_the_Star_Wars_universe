I would never in a million, billion years have suspected the Lt. Col. capable of something like this. It would appear that working for him was much less of an honor than I once thought.|[[Edbr Yamagh]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Wilfred Quelsh''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] who was a highly decorated law enforcement officer of the [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]] until it was discovered that he had framed and murdered a fellow officer at the time of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Your first case involves a stolen Corellian Medal of Honor. It was stolen from a retired CorSec officer, Lt. Col. Wilfred Quelsh. I do not personally know Lt. Col. Quelsh, but I understand he was a highly decorated officer in his time.|[[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Alana Walden|Walden]], to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nWilfred Quelsh served as a [[Corellian Security Force]] officer years before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. At some point, Quelsh took bribe money from [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] for looking the other way as those smugglers brought illegal goods to Corellia and framed a fellow officer, [[Kal Braggan]], for the crime. The betrayed Braggan was convicted, discharged from CorSec and sent to [[Prison/Legends|prison]] for several years, while Quelsh was awarded the [[Corellian Medal of Honor]] for his \"fight\" against corruption within CorSec.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" />\n\nDuring his career, he rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel/Legends|Lieutenant Colonel]], before he eventually retired in the city of [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]]. [[Edbr Yamagh]] worked as his aide during his retirement.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" />\n\nWhen Braggan was released from prison years later, he became a criminal, leading his own gang, called [[Braggan's Fist]]. Braggan eventually found out that Quelsh had framed him and he found proof that Quelsh had been the one taking money from the smugglers. He wrote his story down in his journal.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Braggan contacted Quelsh to meet with him and revealed the proof he had of Quelsh's crime. However the meeting went badly and Quelsh killed Braggan. Quelsh panicked and left in a hurry, accidentally dropping his Medal of Honor at the crime scene. When he discovered that his medal was missing, he started to search for it and eventually asked CorSec to assist him in the search. [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Alana Walden|Walden]] sent an independent agent to investigate the \"theft\" of the Medal. What Quelsh didn't expect, was that the agent discovered the connection to Braggan's Fist and eventually discovered Kal Braggan's corpse with Quelsh's medal next to it. Through Braggan's journal, the agent found out about Quelsh's crimes. The medal he had earned for his wrongdoings had now been the reason for his downfall.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" />\n\nQuelsh was eventually arrested by the CorSec and Major Walden promised the agent that Quelsh would have to pay for all of his crimes.<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWilfred Quelsh was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment's]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'',<ref name=\"SWG:CCFSH\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref> He could be found in the city of Tyrena on Corellia.
