Jabba hired you, didn't he?|Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Black Krrsantan|Star Wars (2015) 20}}\n'''Black Krrsantan''', nicknamed \"'''Santy''',\" \"'''BK''',\" or \"'''Black K'''\" by [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]], was a [[Gender|male]] [[Wookiee]] [[bounty hunter]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Originally captured from his homeworld [[Kashyyyk]] and trained by the infamous [[Xonti Brothers]] as a [[gladiator]], Krrsantan later became a ferocious bounty hunter. He was regularly hired by the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] and at one point, was [[Assault on Cymoon#Aftermath|hired]] by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to track down and capture an [[Cylo|agent]] of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Trained to be a gladiator===\n{{Quote|Ok Noka, they'll do. One question, why isn't the Wookiee in chains?''\"<br />\"''He volunteered.|One of the Xonti Brothers and Noka|Doctor Aphra Annual 1}}\nEarly in [[Gender|his]] life, Black Krrsantan disgraced his [[Wookiee|people]]. Krrsantan was keen to flee [[Kashyyyk]] because of this and he learned that an acquisition crew, that captured aliens for the [[Xonti Brothers]], was coming to Kashyyyk. Krrsantan set a trap for them by leaving an unconscious Wookiee as a bait. When the five [[Trandoshan]]s took the bait, Krrsantan opened fired on them, killing one of the slavers. The others opened fire and Krrsantan gunned down two more of them, pinning down the last two, [[Noka]] and [[Kootan]]. Kootan attempted to kill Krrsantan when the Wookiee swung at him and threw him into a tree, killing the Trandoshan on impact. Krrsantan stood over Noka and ordered the slaver to take him to the Xonti Brothers. Noka put him with the other four aliens he had captured, a [[Talz]], a [[Herglic]], a [[Gamorrean]] and a [[Dowutin]].<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra Annual\">[[Doctor Aphra Annual 1|''Doctor Aphra Annual'' 1]]</ref>\n\nNoka took them to the Xonti Brothers, who were surprised the Wookiee had volunteered. Krrsantan soon realized he chose wrong when they put him through harsh training against his will to be a gladiator. The five candidates were pushed and pushed and the Xonti Brothers started picking them off. The Talz fell first to a [[sarlacc]]. Then the Gamorrean was killed by a large monster. The Herglic fell later to a swarm of robotic insects. This left Krrsantan and the Dowutin. The Xonti Brothers altered the Wookiee's knuckles by filling them with metal to make them better when punching. Krrsantan tested it on the Dowutin and knocked it unconscious in one punch. He was then auctioned to the highest bidder. Krrsantan swore to affect the Xonti Brothers in the same way they had affected him.<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra Annual\" />\n\n===Working for Jabba the Hutt===\n====Tracking Kenobi====\n{{Quote|What happened?

Krrsantan went to the [[Lars Homestead|moisture farm]] nearby and took [[Owen Lars]] hostage. Krrsantan then made Lars scream. He then saw the man, \"Ben\" Kenobi appear behind him. He was given a chance to leave by Kenobi. Krrsantan fought Kenobi, choking him and trapping him with a [[stun net]]. Lars fought back against Krrsantan but was easily knocked aside. Kenobi used [[the Force]] to cause rocks to hit Krrsantan and save Lars from falling. He then tried to [[Death|kill]] Kenobi with a rock. Krrsantan was briefly blinded and scarred by Kenobi's [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's third lightsaber|lightsaber]]. He tried to shoot Kenobi with his [[electrified net gun]], but it was destroyed. Krrsantan then punched and tried to kill Kenobi, as Kenobi attempted to rescue Lars. He continued trying to kill him with his [[bowcaster]] until he fell off the side of a cliff. Krrsantan then fled Tatooine, knowing that Jabba would be incensed at his failure.<ref name=\"Star Wars 20\" />\n\n====Hired by Vader====\n[[File:Black_Krrsantan_AN.png|thumb|left|250px|Black Krrsantan in battle]]\nShortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] traveled to Tatooine on a [[Assault on Cymoon#Aftermath|mission]] to negotiate on behalf of the [[Galactic Empire]] for supplies with Jabba. Vader also used the opportunity to take on a personal mission, and he requested two [[bounty]] hunters from Jabba. The Hutt provided his two best bounty hunters, Krrsantan and [[Boba Fett]]. While Fett was to track down [[Luke Skywalker]], the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] who destroyed the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] and who was secretly Vader's son, Krrsantan was hired to find and capture an [[Cylo|agent]] of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]]. Vader wanted this [[agent]], whose identity and purpose [[Darth Sidious]] did not reveal to the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]], in order to find out why he was working for the Emperor.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 1\" />\n\nKrrsantan successfully tracked down Cylo and discovered that he was moving illegal [[alien]] parts to a [[Cylo's research base|secret base]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. The agent discovered Krrsantan was following him before he could find out where the base was or what he was doing for the Emperor. Krrsantan captured the agent and brought him to Vader aboard his [[Naboo Royal Starship|Nubian]] [[starship]], where he witnessed the agent, whose named was Cylo-IV, being killed by Vader's new [[torture]] [[droid]], [[0-0-0]], but not before providing the information Krrsantan had previously failed to acquire.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 4\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 4|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\n===Working for Aphra===\nSometime after his contract for Vader expired, Krrsantan was summoned along with fellow bounty hunters [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], [[IG-90]] and [[Beebox]] to a [[cantina]] on [[Son-tuul]] where, as he waited for his fellows, Krrsantan entered the cantina's [[fighting pit]]s, where captured Wookiees fought each other for the entertainment of the customers. Krrsantan strangled a fighter and took his place to become a contestant, becoming one of the only Wookiees to enter the pits willingly. The Wookiee bounty hunter won the fight by beating his opponent to death.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 7\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 7]]</ref>\n\n====Heist at Son-tuul====\nAfter the fight, Krrsantan joined Beebox, Bossk and IG-90 in the cantina where they were approached by rogue [[archaeologist]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]], who had issued the summons. She told the assembled bounty hunters about her plans for a [[Son-tuul Pride robbery|heist]]: the Empire had just [[First attack on the Son-tuul Pride|broken]] the criminal element known as the [[Son-tuul Pride]], which dominated Son-tuul's underworld. The fortune they had hoarded was in transit to the Imperial vaults. Aphra told the bounty hunters that she had inside information which would allow them to locate the [[transport]], circumvent the guards and get away, and that she was offering them a part in exchange for their services.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 7\" />\n\nKrrsantan then piloted his [[Black Krrsantan's Auzituck anti-slaver gunship|ship]] during Aphra's robbery near [[Anthan Prime]]. There, Krrsantan was able to use an asteroid to penetrate the [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser's]] [[hull]]. He and the others gathered what remained of the [[credit]]s aboard the [[cruiser]]. He and Aphra used the ship to collect the credits floating in space. He went with Aphra to [[Anthan 13]] where they met with [[Lord]] Vader for information on the people who cut him up.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 8\" />\n\n====Battle of Vrogas Vas====\n[[File:Krrantan_takes_the_blaster_of_Han.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Black Krrsantan take's Han Solo's pistol]]\nKrrsantan then went to [[Vrogas Vas]], where he [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|attacked]] the ''[[Millennium Falcon]] ''by colliding with the ship, grounding it. He then attempted to capture Skywalker, but was instead assaulted by [[Chewbacca]],<ref name=\"Darth Vader 14\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref> who had been recently poisoned by Triple-Zero and so could not best Krrsantan. However, Chewie was then shot with a [[needle]] by [[R2-D2]] to counteract the poison, and Krrsantan was knocked down by Chewbacca. However, Krrsantan was able to knock Chewbacca out with [[Brass knuckles/Canon|brass knuckles]]. He then confronted Solo.<ref name=\"Star Wars 14\">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref> After defeating Chewbacca, Krrsantan then grabbed Solo. However, a damaged [[C-3PO]] told him to stop his fighting. Krrsantan was then accidentally electrocuted by Threepio after punching him with the brass knuckles.<ref name=\"Darth Vader 15\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 15|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>\n\n====Shu-Torun War====\nKrrsantan survived the battle.

The last Trandoshan, Noka, was surprised of Krrsantan's willingness to join. However, Krrsantan soon found out what he really signed up for and after harsh training as a gladiator, he swore a life debt on the Xonti Brothers, a pledge to affect them in the same way they had affected him.<ref name=\"Doctor Aphra Annual\" /> Krrsantan eventually saw the Xonti Brothers again during the [[auction of Rur]], where he attempted to capture them. After the Auction ended in the deaths of many members, Krrsantan used it as his chance to capture the Xonti Brothers and he did, taking them back to their gladiatorial pits to fulfill the life debt.<ref name=\"Enormous Profit V\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 13|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 13]]</ref>\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|Any idea what that means?''\"<br />\"''It means I sure wouldn't wanna be ''whoever'' he gets his hands on out there.|Pagetti Rook and a Klatooinian, on Black Krrsantan|Star Wars (2015) 20}}\nBlack Krrsantan was harshly trained as a gladiator by the Xonti Brothers.
