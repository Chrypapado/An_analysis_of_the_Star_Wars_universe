After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], he lived in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]] and served as a henchman for [[Ames Miss'd]], along with [[Anita B'ath]].<ref name=\"SWG:TtRaL\" /> Around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\" /> Box O'Rox and his associates used to harass new recruits of the rival [[Meatlumps|Meatlump gang]]. Angered by this situation, a food supply clerk of the Meatlumps tasked a spacer affiliated with the Meatlumps to teach the Ragtags a lesson. The spacer therefore met Ames Miss'd outside Coronet. The former attempted to intimidate the Ragtag but Miss'd was not scared and ordered Anita and Box to attack the spacer. Eventually, the spacer managed to kill them both. Unable to defend himself, Ames Miss'd surrendered and accepted to live the Meatlumps alone.<ref name=\"SWG:TtRaL\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBox O'Rox appeared as a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TtRaL\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Box O'Rox was added to the game as part of the \"[[W:c:swg:Meatlumps Theme Park|Meatlumps Theme Park]]\", introduced with \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 10|Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King]]\", released on [[June 19]], [[2008]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67812&month=062008|text=Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King|archivedate=20110924005831}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Teach the Ragtags a Lesson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miss'd, Ames}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
