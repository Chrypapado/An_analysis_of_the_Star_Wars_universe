Bel faked an explosion of its processing plants and staged in an apparent [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] shortage. By pretending that the production of the drug has decreased by two-thirds, and then the price rose rapidly, he drove himself a substantial profit. The Viceroy of the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] [[Hask]] was privy to Adol Bel's plans. This led to the [[Stark Hyperspace War/Legends|Stark Hyperspace War]].\n\nDuring the war, Adol Bel later found his displeasure with Iaco Stark when he released a [[navcomputer virus]] that all vessels prevented access to [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] routes. Bel was not able to extradite its tons of excess bacta.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 37|''Star Wars'' (1998) 37]] {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Adol Bel\n|es=Adol Bel\n|hu=Adol Bel\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bel, Adol}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thyferrans]]"}}}]}}}}
