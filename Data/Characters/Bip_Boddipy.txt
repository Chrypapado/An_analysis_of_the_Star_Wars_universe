He was known to be a kidnapper and a murderer.\n\n==Biography==\nLiving on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], Bip started his life as a criminal and began to wonder throughout the galaxy, committing terrible crimes by kidnapping and murdering. He was later captured by the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] along with 49 other of the most dangerous criminals on [[M'Bardi]] and would be shipped to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. While been guarded by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]], the cruiser was attacked by [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] under the command of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]]. The cruiser's main reactor was damaged, causing the cells to open and the prisoners who therefore can attack the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. While the Jedi were trying to hold the prisoners, the crew tried to repair the reactor until they ultimately failed. Bip and several prisoners were reluctant at first to cooperate with the Jedi until they decided in repairing the ship. Moving safely through Republic space, Skywalker thanked Blank and the prisoners for helping and guaranteed that their aid will affect their parole.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCWUKCite|6.30|Out}} {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Bip Boddipy\n|nl=Bip Boddipy\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boddipy, Bip}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
