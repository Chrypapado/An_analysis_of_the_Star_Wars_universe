Under Odra's influence, the [[King/Legends|king]] sent [[Icehead]]s to [[Thief/Legends|steal]] the season scepter from his brother, the [[Sun King]]. Odra and the Snow King used the [[magic]]al staff to [[Odra crisis|freeze]] the [[Moon/Legends|moon]], sending a blanket of snow across its surface, and she cackled with delight. Odra complimented the Snow King on freezing Endor, but he began to reconsider their actions. Odra froze his heart again and instructed him to freeze the Ewoks of [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]] and take their powerful [[Sunstar/Legends|Sunstar]].<ref name=\"Season Scepter\" />\n\nThe [[Leaf Queen]], one of the Snow King's sisters, warned the Ewoks and told them to meet her at the [[Sun King's palace]].

Believing that the four Ewoks carried the Sunstar with them, Odra plotted to intercept the group before they could reach the Sun King.

The Snow King froze Kintaka in a block of ice, and Odra praised the king's cleverness, stating that they could trade the Ewok princess for the Sunstar. Odra imagined the possible achievements she could do with the Sunstar's power, contemplating making a [[Necklace/Legends|necklace]] or destroying a [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Her reverie was interrupted by the other three Ewoks, who had come to the Snow Palace to rescue Kintaka. The Ewoks had disguised themselves as \"[[ice-on-a-stick]] [[Merchant/Legends|peddlers]],\" and Odra vaguely recognized them. However, the Snow King noticed no deception, and he dropped the season scepter to eat one of the [[Foodstuff/Legends|treats]]. The Ewok Teebo tried to grab the season scepter but picked up an [[Icehead club]] instead. With the Ewoks' identities revealed, Odra laughed, and the Snow King picked up the scepter.<ref name=\"Season Scepter\" />\n\n[[File:OdraDefeated-TSS.png|thumb|right|275px|Odra is defeated by the Ewoks.]]\nOdra [[Skirmish at the Snow Palace|commanded]] the Snow King to freeze the Ewoks, and they scattered as he fired icy energy from the scepter. The Iceheads pursued Teebo and Warrick, and Odra began to chase Latara. One of the Iceheads collided into Odra, and both fell to the floor. Soon after, Teebo took the scepter from the Snow King and wildly fired its seasonal energy. One blast struck Odra and melted her membranous [[Crown/Legends|headdress]], revealing her bald head. Odra and the Snow King demanded that Teebo return the scepter, but Warrick ran to Teebo's aide. Warrick grabbed the scepter and fired it at the Snow King, warming the king's icy heart and melting Odra. The Frost Sprite yelled in defeat and shrank to a tiny proportion of her original size. Once her transformation was complete, she screamed defiantly and scuttled out of the Snow Palace, claiming that she would return. With Odra gone, the Snow King restored Endor to its summer season and returned the scepter to the Sun King.<ref name=\"Season Scepter\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You see, our brother, the Snow King, has fallen in love with an evil Frost Sprite, Odra, the Duchess of Sleet.''\"<br />\"''A real cold chick, indeed.|The Leaf Queen and the Sun King|audio=LeafQueenandSunKing-Ewoks.ogg|The Season Scepter}}\nOdra was a Frost Sprite with [[Color/Legends|teal]] skin and yellow [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"Season Scepter\" /> Enthralling and evil,<ref name=\"Insider 27\">{{InsiderCite|27|A Star Wars CELibration|A ''Star Wars'' CELibration}}</ref> Odra froze the heart of the Snow King and manipulated him to steal the season scepter.
