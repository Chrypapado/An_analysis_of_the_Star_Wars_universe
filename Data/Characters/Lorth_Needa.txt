In the midst of the battle, Needa successfully engaged several fleeing [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] [[Starship|transports]], but it was his pursuit of one&mdash;Captain [[Han Solo]]'s ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''&mdash;that sealed his fate. After a lengthy chase, the ''Avenger'' had the ''Falcon'' in its sights before Solo suddenly changed course and charged the Star Destroyer's bridge, only to disappear from its [[sensor]]s. Not knowing how the ''Falcon'' could have eluded him, Needa decided to take responsibility for the situation and personally apologize to Vader, who killed him as punishment for losing the ship.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Clone Wars===\nA [[human]] [[Gender|male]] hailing from [[Coruscant]], Lorth Needa served in the [[Galactic Republic Navy|navy]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]],<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> as the [[Lieutenant Commander|lieutenant commander]] of [[Home Fleet Strike Group Five|Strike Group Five]] of the [[Coruscant Home Defense Fleet]], where he [[Commanding officer|commanded]] the [[Carrack-class light cruiser|''Carrack''-class light cruiser]] [[Integrity (Carrack-class)|''Integrity'']].<ref name=\"BMF 52\" /> In [[19 BBY]],<ref name=\"Galactic Atlas\" /> Needa, alongside Strike Group Five, took part in the [[Battle of Coruscant]], in which [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[General]] [[Grievous]] attacked the [[planet]] with a massive [[Confederacy of Independent Systems Navy|armada]] and kidnapped [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]].<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" />\n\nDuring the battle, Needa and his massed [[Starship|ships]] surrounded Grievous's [[flagship]], the [[Providence-class Dreadnought|''Providence''-class Dreadnought]] ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', where he demanded the Kaleesh to surrender himself, but was met with resistance as the general explained that Palpatine was aboard the [[dreadnought]]. In disbelief, Needa gave Grievous ten [[Standard minute|minutes]] to prove himself before the ''Invisible Hand'' was to be fired upon by Strike Group Five.<ref name=\"BMF 52\" /> The Chancellor was later rescued by [[Jedi Knight]]s [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]], who boarded Grievous' [[flagship]], the ''[[Invisible Hand]]''.<ref name=\"RotS\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>\n\n===Imperial Era===\n{{Quote|Shields up.|Captain Needa, after seeing the ''Millennium Falcon'' move to attack the ''Avenger''|audio=Needa-ShieldsUp.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\nAfter the Clone Wars came to an [[Mission to Mustafar|end]] and the [[Galactic Empire]] was [[Proclamation of the New Order|proclaimed]], Needa served in the [[Imperial Navy]] as an [[Imperial officer|officer]], serving as a lieutenant commander aboard a ''Carrack''-class light cruiser.<ref name=\"SWFC\">''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:CaptainNeeda-SWZ.png|thumb|left|250px|Needa observes a hologram of the Hoth asteroid field pursuit.]]\nLater, he was in command of the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Avenger]]''<ref name=\"SWE\" /> in [[Death Squadron]], a task force of the Imperial Navy under the command of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader.<ref name=\"SD-SWE\">{{SWE|technology|imperialstardestroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer}}</ref> In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Yavin|Battle]] of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], Death [[Squadron]] was responsible for tracking down the [[Echo Base|hidden headquarters]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], an insurgent faction at [[Galactic Civil War|war]] with the Galactic Empire for control of [[the galaxy]]. After discovering a Rebel base on the [[planet]] [[Hoth]], Death Squadron launched an [[Battle of Hoth|assault]] on the Rebel forces gathered there. During the fighting, which culminated in a resounding victory for the Empire,<ref name=\"ESB\" /> Needa and the ''Avenger'' engaged several Rebel [[Starship|ships]] in battle as they attempted to flee from the [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]].<ref name=\"SWE\" />\n\nAmong the Rebel vessels that found itself in Needa's sights was the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', a [[freighter]] owned by Rebel sympathizer [[Han Solo]]. Solo, along with his co-[[pilot]] [[Chewbacca]] and the Rebel leader [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], had fled from Imperial forces on Hoth. However, with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[hyperdrive]] non-operational, they were unable to make the jump to [[hyperspace]] and escape from the [[Star Destroyer]]s in [[orbit]]. Needa and the ''Avenger'' closed in on the ''Falcon'', but Solo outmaneuvered his pursuers, causing the ''Avenger'' to nearly collide with two other [[Star Destroyer]]s. Solo and company took refuge in a nearby [[asteroid]] [[Hoth asteroid belt|field]], whereupon the Empire lost track of them for a [[time]]. Via [[hologram]], Needa informed Darth Vader that the ''Falcon'' had likely been destroyed in the asteroid field, but the [[Sith]] Lord suspected otherwise and ordered the search to continue.<ref name=\"ESB\" /> Needa then contacted [[Lieutenant]] [[Obrax]] and [[Theta Squadron (Galactic Empire)|Theta Squadron]], deploying a group of fighters to patrol the area and threatening to execute any pilot who returned from the patrol prematurely.<ref name=\"FACPOV\">{{Shortstory|story=Amara Kel's Rules for TIE Pilot Survival (Probably)|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\n[[File:YouHaveToBeKidding-ESB.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lorth Needa on the bridge of the ''Avenger'' during the pursuit of the ''Millennium Falcon'']]\nSure enough, the ''Falcon'' had not been destroyed; after the freighter emerged from the asteroid field, the ''Avenger'' resumed its pursuit. With Vader informed of this development, Needa prepared to capture the elusive freighter, but Solo abruptly altered course and flew directly toward the ''Avenger''{{'s}} [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]]; a move Needa interpreted to be an attack run. He ordered the Star Destroyer to raise its [[Deflector shield|shields]], but the ''Falcon'' merely skimmed the surface of the command tower before disappearing from the [[warship]]'s [[sensor]]s. An incredulous Needa could not comprehend how the ''Falcon'' could have disappeared, since it was too small to have a functional [[cloaking device]]&mdash;unbeknownst to the Imperials, Solo had merely attached his freighter to the rear of the ''Avenger''{{'s}} bridge tower.<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\n[[File:WorstSoreThroatEver-ESB.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Needa was telekinetically strangled to death by Darth Vader.]]\nNevertheless, when Vader demanded an update on the ''Avenger''{{'s}} progress, Needa decided to travel to the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]'' to personally apologize to the Sith Lord for losing track of his quarry. Needa did just that, whereupon the Sith Lord [[Force choke|telekinetically strangled]] the [[captain]] to [[death]] as punishment for his failure. Vader mockingly accepted Needa's apology before a pair of [[Imperial Navy Trooper]]s dragged his lifeless body away.<ref name=\"ESB\" /> Meanwhile, the TIEs of Theta Squadron that disobeyed Needa's orders and broke off from their patrol to enter the asteroid field returned and avoided discipline from their late commanding officer.<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nStanding 1.75 [[meter]]s tall, Captain Lorth Needa was a<ref name=\"SWE\" /> ruthless<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> and capable Star Destroyer commander within Darth Vader's fleet. Though he feared the Sith Lord, Needa decided to personally apologize to Vader after failing to capture the ''Millennium Falcon'' in the aftermath of the Hoth campaign.<ref name=\"SWE\" /> Vader \"accepted\" his apology, but Needa did not live to hear it.<ref name=\"ESB\" /> Needa had an accent reflective of his upbringing in the [[Core Worlds]]. After being assigned a patrol and threatened by Needa, [[TIE pilot]] \"[[Howlrunner (Theta Squadron)|Howlrunner]]\", who flew as [[Theta Seven]], mocked his accent when complaining to fellow pilot \"[[Amara Kel|Shadow]].\"<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCaptain Needa was portrayed by [[Michael Culver]] in the [[1980]] film [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], the second installment of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[original trilogy]].<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\n''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'' says that Needa once was \"only a Lieutenant Commander,\" and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' tells us that Needa was a Captain, despite [[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']] stating that a Captain is lower than [[Lieutenant Commander]]. This could hint, however, that perhaps Needa was demoted at some point before the events of ''Empire''. This could also be a reference to a tradition in at least some navies to refer to the commander of a ship as \"captain\" regardless of rank.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Original Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel]]''\n*[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] {{1st}}\n*''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]''\n*[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?
