Some small nobility.|Dunlan|Rebellion 9}}\n'''Dunlan''' was the leader of a [[Ahakistan rebels|resistance movement]] against the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Ahakista/Legends|Ahakista's]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]]-backed [[Ahakistan Council|government]].\n\n==Biography==\nAfter Ahakista's democratic government was dissolved by the Empire, it was replaced by one composed of members of the planet's wealthy upper class and loyal to the Empire.<ref>[[Rebellion 7|''Rebellion'' 7]], page 18.</ref><ref>[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], page 8.</ref> Like his fellow citizens, Dunlan resented the new government's policies, which had eroded the prosperity and freedom that they had been accustomed to.<ref>[[Rebellion 7|''Rebellion'' 7]], page 7.</ref> Dunlan eventually became the leader of a resistance movement in a [[Ahakistan Civil War|civil war]] against the government.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion 8 The Ahakista Gambit Part 3 4\">[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], page 4.</ref>\n\nWhen Dunlan rose to prominence, he was viewed by disenfranchised citizens as a hero. As explosions shook the streets Ahakista, however, government officials took a dimmer view of him as a terrorist and a threat to their grasp on power.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion 7 The Ahakista Gambit Part 2 4\">[[Rebellion 7|''Rebellion'' 7]], page 4.</ref> After Dunlan assassinated [[Council]]man [[Derral]] and [[Derral's friend|Derral's fellow council member]], the Empire ascertained that the intensity of the conflict posed a significant threat to certain assets that were located on Ahakista and decided to directly intervene.<ref>[[Rebellion 6|''Rebellion'' 6]], pages 13-15.</ref><ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion 7 The Ahakista Gambit Part 2 4\" />\n\nShortly after he was nearly crushed by an [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|All Terrain Armored Transport]] that had been walking through the formerly prosperous parts of the city, Dunlan was invited to a meeting convened by [[Sardoth]].<ref>[[Rebellion 7|''Rebellion'' 7]], pages 6-8.</ref><ref name=\"Star Wars: Rebellion 8 The Ahakista Gambit Part 3 4\" /> The owner of the [[Daystar Casino/Legends|Daystar Casino]] had brought with himself a motley group who he had claimed were members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. During the briefing, Dunlan learned that the Empire had been using Ahakista as a base for [[The Hub (computer)|the Hub]], a supercomputer housed inside [[Pyramid One|the pyramid]] at the center of the city. The Hub was of great importance to the Empire, since it purpose was to coordinate the vast [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. Sardoth then came to the reason for why he had contacted Dunlan: He wanted Dunlan's group of rebels to destroy the pyramid's power control station so that the off-worlders could infiltrate and destroy the Hub itself.<ref>[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], pages 7-8.</ref>\n\nDunlan acknowledged that it was likely that the Empire would lose any interest that it had in Ahakista if the Hub was destroyed and would subsequently end its interference in the planet's affairs, but he refused to help Sardoth. He did not want to \"sacrifice [his] people as a mere distraction\" in a frontal assault on the pyramid for a cause other than that of the citizens of Ahakista.<ref>[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], pages 9-11.</ref>\n\nDunlan stormed out of the meeting and found himself on the business end of a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. The man holding it was [[Fenic]], who up until now was one of his fellow rebels. Fenic had planned to kill Dunlan and then collect the sizable [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] that the Empire had placed on Dunlan's head, but it turned out to be harder in actual practice. Dunlan encouraged Fenic to pull the trigger, telling him that he believed in what he was fighting for and that he was willing to [[Death/Legends|die]] for his cause. Dunlan then asked Fenic if he could say the same. Before Fenic could agonize any further on the choice that had been presented to him by Dunlan, [[Wyl Tarson]], one of the offworlders, incapacitated Fenic. Dunlan thanked Tarson for it but still refused to help him. He believed that there would be \"other ways, other methods\" to end the oppression of his fellow citizens.<ref>[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], page 13-14.</ref>\n\nAt the time Dunlan did not know that he had been betrayed by [[Astor]], another of his subordinates.<ref>[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], page 6.</ref><ref>[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], page 17.</ref> Upon his return to a safe house after the abortive meeting, it was raided by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. While Vader and his troops were distracted by the task of killing Dunlan's fellow rebels, Dunlan slipped away and ran.<ref>[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]], pages 18-20.</ref>\n\nWith the rest of his options closed, Dunlan chose to do exactly what he had earlier refused to sacrifice his people for: He was going to destroy the power control station on the pyramid's tenth floor with a surface-to-air missile. His first stop was the house of an [[Unidentified elderly Ahakistan woman|old woman]] who had allowed Dunlan's rebels to use it as hiding place for their weapons. As Dunlan took out the floorboards and appropriated a rocket launcher, the old woman beckoned him to look through the window and he saw Imperial walkers once again crushing buildings beneath their feet and [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE/sa bombers]] dropping their deadly payloads.<ref>[[Rebellion 9|''Rebellion'' 9]], pages 1-4.</ref>\n\nJust one step ahead of Vader and the stormtroopers, Dunlan stole a [[X-34 landspeeder/Legends|X-34 landspeeder]] and searched for a place from which he could fire his missile at the pyramid. After he found a spot, he was grazed in the chest by a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] bolt. He found himself unsure and afraid of death, but the sight of Vader and the stormtroopers approaching reminded him that he was fighting for the future of Ahakista and its people.<ref>[[Rebellion 9|''Rebellion'' 9]], pages 18-19.</ref>\n\nAfter Dunlan destroyed the power control station, Vader finally caught up to him. Before the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] stabbed him through the heart with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Dunlan threw open his arms in a gesture of defiance and told him that he was too late and that \"What we've started cannot be stopped.\"<ref>[[Rebellion 9|''Rebellion'' 9]], pages 20-21.</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Rebellion 6|''Rebellion'' 6]] {{1st}}\n*[[Rebellion 7|''Rebellion'' 7]]\n*[[Rebellion 8|''Rebellion'' 8]]\n*[[Rebellion 9|''Rebellion'' 9]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dunlan\n}}\n\n[[Category:Ahakistans]]\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
