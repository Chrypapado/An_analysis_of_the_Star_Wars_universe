Following the [[destruction of Alderaan]] at the hands of the Empire, Never Die sought revenge by designing the [[Shard of Alderaan]], a slicing program capable of deciphering any Imperial [[Scandoc/Legends|scandoc]], for use by the Rebel Alliance. The program was stolen by the [[Merchant/Legends|trader]] and criminal [[Begas Tok]], who took it to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] and attempted to sell it to the highest bidder.\n\n==Biography==\n\"Never Die\" was the code name of a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] in the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]] between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. After the Empire [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]<ref name=\"shard\" /> in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]],<ref name=\"TNEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> Never Die created a slicing program he called the [[Shard of Alderaan]] to help the Alliance. The program was capable of deciphering even complicated, high-security documents, including the tight encryption schemes of Imperial [[Scandoc/Legends|scandocs]], and would leave the entire Imperial communications network open to the Alliance.<ref name=\"shard\" />\n\nNever Die hired the [[Merchant/Legends|trader]] and criminal mastermind [[Begas Tok]] to locate a representative of the Alliance so that he could give them the Shard. However, recognizing the profit he could make with the Shard, Tok stole the program from the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] slicer and took it to the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] in order to sell it to the highest bidder. Tok scheduled a meeting aboard the ''[[Dune Princess]]''&mdash;a luxurious [[Sail barge/Legends|sail barge]] owned by one of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt's]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenants]], [[Heater (henchman)|Heater]]&mdash;under the cover of one of his [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] parties. The Empire and Alliance both sent representatives to the meeting to attempt to acquire the Shard. Never Die also sent his [[Battle droid/Legends|droid]], [[0-1B]], disguised as a common [[Medical droid/Legends|medical droid]], to retrieve the program from Tok and either return it to Never Die or ensure it was placed in the hands of Rebel agents. In the event 0-1B was unable to retrieve the slicing program, Never Die equipped the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] with a [[Computer virus/Legends|data virus]] to use to destroy the Shard. An unexpected [[Sandstorm/Legends|sandstorm]] grounded the ''Dune Princess'' during the meeting, trapping all aboard until the storm passed.<ref name=\"shard\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nNever Die went into a rage when the Empire destroyed his homeworld. A skilled slicer, he designed the Shard of Alderaan as revenge against the Empire, hoping the Rebel Alliance would use his program to listen to guarded Imperial transmissions.<ref name=\"shard\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n\"Never Die\" was first mentioned in the adventure \"[[The Shard of Alderaan]]\" in the [[1996]] [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|roleplaying]] guide ''[[Live-Action Adventures]]''.<ref name=\"shard\" /> He later received an entry in the [[2008]] reference book ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.<ref name=\"cswe\">{{CSWECite|II|373|Never Die}}</ref> \"The Shard of Alderaan\" adventure is left open-ended, with the result of the party and the fate of the Shard of Alderaan program left to the players.<ref name=\"shard\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Live-Action Adventures|story=The Shard of Alderaan}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Live-Action Adventures]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slicers]]"}}}]}}}}
