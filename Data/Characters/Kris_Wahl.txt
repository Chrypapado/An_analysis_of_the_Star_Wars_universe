Like his parents, Kris had a number of vices. Unlike them, he was also into philanthropy, and provided large number of credits to causes, including [[Gerta Haman]]'s relief projects to aid the [[Tarasin]]. His parents disapproved of his association with Haman, believing her to be an alarmist and a bad influence upon Kris.<ref name=\"TRW\">''[[The Resistance Within]]''</ref>\n\nWhen Haman started the [[Cularin resistance]] in [[31 BBY/Legends|31 BBY]], Kris again provided her financial support, and disappeared to join the resistance at its base in the [[Cloud Mountain mines]].<ref name=\"TRW\" /> Kris enjoyed grand heroic stories, and approached resistance members to tell him about themselves under the pretense of \"liking to know where his money was going.\"<ref name=\"ARv\">''[[A Revelation]]''</ref>\n\nDespite his wealth, Kris sometimes let gambling debts accumulate. He owed a man named [[Polst]] [[1138 (number)|1,138]] credits at the time of his disappearance.<ref name=\"TRW\" />\n\nOne month after his joining, Haman decided to organize a raid against the [[Metatheran Cartel jungle base]] to gain the last evidence they needed to consolidate their case against the Cartel. A few people in the base had been in the jungle base, so Haman asked Wahl to question them and obtain any valuable information about the jungle base. During this interview, the Cartel forces began their own attack against the Cloud Mountain mines. Wahl's fate after the attack is unknown.<ref name=\"ARv\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKris Wahl was a ladies' man and [[Gambler/Legends|gambler]]. Kris dressed to look like a rakish scoundrel, leaving his shirt unbuttoned for instance. His clothes looked more they were bought from a costume shop, however. When combined with his boyish face, the effect was more amusing than dashing.<ref name=\"ARv\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[A Revelation]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{FFG|book=Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Game Master's Kit|text=''Star Wars: Age of Rebellion'' Game Master's Kit|story=Dead in the Water|stext=Dead in the Water}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wahl, Kris}}\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
