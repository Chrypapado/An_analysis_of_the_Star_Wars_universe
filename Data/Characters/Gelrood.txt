After winning fifteen games straight in the [[Upper City Cantina]], he was accused of cheating.

It is likely that Gelrood beat Niklos multiple times in the Upper City Cantina resulting in him getting banned and labeled falsely as a cheater.\n\nAnother NPC in the game named [[Holdan]] has the exact same character model and outfit as Gelrood, despite them both appearing in Javyars's Cantina simultaneously.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gelrood\n|es=Gelrood\n|pl=Gelrood\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0440\u0443\u0434\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
