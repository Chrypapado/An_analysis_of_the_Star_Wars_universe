Cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Laeel resided in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] where he created two works of art, titled ''[[Rainbow Berry Bush]]'' and ''[[Raventhorn Plant]]''. Both of these [[Painting/Legends|paintings]] were subsequently featured in the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]] by curator [[Lilas Dinhint]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Greetings. I'm afraid I have little to offer you as I am but an impoverished artist.\"<br />\"Not even a credit or two?\"<br />\"Not even that.

At this rate I'll be stuck in this sand ball forever.|Klepa Laeel and a passerby|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Artist/Legends|artist]] by the name of Klepa Laeel lived during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a major conflict between the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. By the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> cerca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"Ruins\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine]]''</ref> Laeel could usually be found behind the [[Mos Espa Starport|starport]] in [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]], a [[City/Legends|city]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. While there, he created two [[Painting/Legends|paintings]], one titled ''[[Rainbow Berry Bush]]'', which depicted a [[rainbow berry]], and another titled ''[[Raventhorn Plant]]'', which depicted a [[raventhorn plant]]. Laeel preferred to do still life paintings of [[Plant/Legends|plants]] such as these, because as a starving artist with nary a [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] to his name, wild plants did not cost him anything. However, he was forced to scrape together every bit he could just to purchase his painting supplies. At the rate he was going, Laeel worried that he would be stuck on Tatooine forever.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in Tatooine's Imperial [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], curator [[Lilas Dinhint]] oversaw the [[Museum of Tatooine/Legends|Museum of Tatooine]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> which served as the planet's only [[Museum/Legends|museum]].<ref name=\"Eisley\">''[[Galaxy Guide 7: Mos Eisley]]''</ref> Dinhint sought to enhance the museum's collection by offering visitors something new. To that end, the museum selected a small number of artists who would be approached for an opportunity to have their art featured in Bestine. Klepa Laeel was one of the artists to be considered, along with [[Vanvi Hotne]], [[Giaal Itotr]], [[Kahfr Oladi]], [[Boulo Siesi]], and [[Kolka Zteht/Legends|Kolka Zteht]]. In order to have his paintings featured in Bestine, however, Laeel required enough votes to win over his fellow artists. Lilas Dinhint held a Bestine Museum art competition every thirty [[Standard day/Legends|days]], allowing for a period of fifteen days in between in which individuals could vote for their favorite artist.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nDuring the course of his artistry career, Laeel was approached by a number of [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], many of whom voted for him as their artist of choice. Laeel won the art competitions at various times, allowing him the opportunity to display his paintings in Bestine's museum for a period of thirty days. During the time his paintings were displayed, the corrupt curator Dinhint offered schematics of the artworks in exchange for a \"modest donation\" of 48,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. This allowed the opportunity for [[Architect/Legends|architecturally-inclined]] furniture makers and [[Merchant/Legends|traders]] to mass-produce copies of Laeel's paintings so that they could be purchased, [[Collector/Legends|collected]], or displayed for personal use. With his paintings now on display, Laeel hoped that he would finally be able to earn enough [[Currency/Legends|money]] to travel again, and see more of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:RainbowBerryBush.png|150px|thumb|''Rainbow Berry Bush'']]\nKlepa Laeel had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], and blue-colored [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. Laeel was a humble individual who desired to see more of the galaxy, but his lack of income prevented such notions. However, his skill as an artist with an eye for still life paintings earned him an opportunity to feature his art in Bestine. With his fortunes reversing for the better, Laeel hoped to resume his travels.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RaventhornPlantPainting.png|150px|thumb|''Raventhorn Plant'']]\nDuring his time as an artist in Mos Espa, Laeel wore a black, hooded [[Cloak/Legends|cloak]], beneath which he wore a white sidebutton [[shirt]]. He also wore a pair of tan-colored dress slacks with a pair of black uniform [[Boot/Legends|boots]].<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKlepa Laeel was a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] [[Star Wars Galaxies|''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided'']], a [[Roleplaying game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]], prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"SWG\" /><ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> He was added to the game on [[February 11]], [[2004]] as part of [[W:c:swg:Publish 6 Notes: 11 February 04|Publish 6 The Imperial Crackdown]]. The update featured a new [[W:c:swg:Bestine Painting Election|Bestine Museum event]], in which players could vote for a number of NPC artists in order to have one of their paintings put up for display in the [[W:c:swg:Bestine Museum|museum]].<ref name=\"Publish 6\">{{SonyCite|url=recent_updates.jsp?o=60893|text=Publish 6 The Imperial Crackdown|archivedate=20051016001034}}</ref><ref name=\"SWG\" /> Klepa Laeel was one of these artists, and players who chose to vote for him were required to first converse with him in [[W:c:swg:Mos Espa|Mos Espa]]. If Laeel got the most votes, one of his paintings, either [[W:c:swg:Painting of a Rainbow Berry Bush|''Rainbow Berry Bush'']] or [[W:c:swg:Painting of a Raventhorn Plant|''Raventhorn Plant'']], would be displayed for about a one [[Standard month/Legends|month]] period, and players could purchase [[W:c:swg:Schematic|schematics]] of the paintings during a two [[Standard week/Legends|week]] period for a fee of 48,000 [[W:c:swg:Imperial Credit|credits]]. The winning artist depended on the player's input, however as the competitions were held monthly, this article assumes 100% game completion, and that Klepa Laeel won the right to display both of her paintings on at least several occasions.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041a\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u044d\u043b\u044c\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laeel, Klepa}}\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
