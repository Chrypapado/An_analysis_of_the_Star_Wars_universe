His report was understated, to say the least. Imperial casualties were evidently very high.|Hantor Loftus, to Mon Mothma|N.R.I.

He operated as a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], with significant interactions with [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] sympathetic to the Alliance. In the period following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Loftus was responsible for derailing [[Project Lasercutter]], an [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]]-led initiative aimed at capturing Rebel-aligned smugglers.\n\nCaptain Loftus later joined the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]], still based on Tatooine. In [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]], Loftus led a recovery and incarceration team to recover survivors from a [[Mission to Tatooine (Kyle Katarn)|raid]] by [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] agent [[Kyle Katarn]] on an [[Imperial Remnant]] [[Empire Reborn base|recruiting base]] on the planet. Loftus reported directly to N.R.I. official [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]] on the outcome of the mission, requesting that Katarn stay out of future N.R.I. intelligence-gathering missions due to his aggressive techniques.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rebel Alliance===\n{{Quote|You're a good soldier.

He became aware of an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] initiative named [[Project Lasercutter]], which aimed to capture [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance in order to undermine Rebel supply lines. Setting up a temporary base of operations in a [[Mos Entha hotel|hotel complex]] in the settlement of [[Mos Entha/Legends|Mos Entha]], Loftus ordered a number of missions designed to foil this project. Initially, he recruited a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] to intercept and [[Death/Legends|kill]] an Imperial agent targeting a smuggler on Tatooine. Shortly afterward, Loftus received word that the Imperials were targeting [[Jaxa Lian]], one of his most reliable smugglers. Enlisting the spacer a second [[Time/Legends|time]], Loftus paid for Lian to be escorted back to his base of operations.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nWith the safe return of Lian, Loftus focused on uncovering the source of the Empire's accurate information. Eventually, Loftus discovered a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] placed in the Alliance recruiting program, a native of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] known as [[Lidek Baws]]. Baws was to meet his Imperial overseers out in the desert, prompting Loftus to send the spacer after him. The spacer directly confronted Baws and killed him and the other Imperials. Until then, Loftus had believed the [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|Imperial Security Bureau]] was responsible for Project Lasercutter; however, he then discovered that it was actually directed by members of the [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]], a top-secret division of [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]]. Loftus knew that if they could kill the Project's lead Inquisitor, the loss would set Project Lasercutter back by [[Standard month/Legends|months]], if not permanently derailing it. Therefore, he sent the spacer on another mission to kill the lead Inquisitor, after warning the spacer that the Inquisitors were deadly opponents and rumored to be able to use [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. With these warnings in mind, the spacer was able to kill the Inquisitor.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n===New Republic===\n[[File:Kyle_Katarn.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Captain Loftus criticized Kyle Katarn for his aggressive techniques.]]\nAfter the Rebel Alliance transitioned into the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], Loftus became a member of the [[New Republic Intelligence Service]], the successor to earlier Rebel [[Spy/Legends|spy]] networks and the [[Senate Planetary Intelligence Network]]. By [[12 ABY/Legends|12 ABY]], Loftus held the rank of captain in this service. That [[Standard year/Legends|year]], New Republic agent [[Kyle Katarn]] raided an [[Imperial Remnant]] [[Empire Reborn base|headquarters]] on Tatooine, which had been recruiting from amongst the populace.

Loftus sent the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]] on to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] for furthering interrogation, along with a preliminary report on the mission that was directed to [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], a former New Republic [[Chief of State (New Republic)|Chief of State]] now working for N.R.I.
