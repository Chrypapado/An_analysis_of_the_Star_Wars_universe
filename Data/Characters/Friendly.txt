He was captured by the [[Coruscant Wildlife Management Department]] and fitted with cybernetics as part of a secret project to turn Coruscani ogres into worker drones. He was the most successful subject in the project and was obedient and controllable about 80% of the time. However, his implants suffered from software glitches that would occasionally cause him to act in an unpredictable manner. The scientists in the project tried to replicate their success with Friendly in other ogres, but were unable to, as the success with him had been a fluke.\n\nWhen the project was restarted by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], they redesignated all the cybernetic ogres as ''Friendlies'', although none of them were as controllable as he had been.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030501ogre|text=Lobotmized Ogre|int=Lobotomized Ogre|archivedate=20090603072812}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Friendly\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscani ogres]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Named creatures]]"}}}]}}}}
