He made his fortune in a number of endeavors, including sponsoring the [[Galactic Costume Extravaganza]], but was known as an information broker who maintained a wide-reaching network of agents to gather data. Shortly after the death of one of his agents, a [[Cerean/Legends|Cerean]] named [[Anoura]], Elwis' daughter, [[Jennalyn Bontraar]], was kidnapped by [[Zascha]] and held for ransom in [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]]. Zascha hoped to exact revenge against Bontraar for his sister Anoura's death. Elwis hired a group of freelance agents&mdash;who were trying to recover a data disk from him&mdash;to rescue Jennalyn, during the planned exchange aboard the ''[[Masquerade]]''. The agents succeeded in rescuing Jennalyn, but Zascha was able to escape alive.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20030320masquerade|text=Masquerade|int=Masquerade (online adventure)|archivedate=20091016060524}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|See ''Galactic Costume Extravaganza''}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bontraar, Elwis}}\n[[Category:Bothans]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
