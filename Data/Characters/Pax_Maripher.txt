But you have to understand where he comes from.|Rahara Wick, describing her friend to Qui-Gon Jinn|Master & Apprentice}}\n'''Pax Maripher''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] involved with illegal [[gemstone]] trading with his partner [[Rahara Wick]]. Maripher survived an attack by [[Delphidian]] [[pirate]]s when he was only five years old by hiding in an equipment hatch, but everyone else onboard, including his parents, were killed. Maripher was raised by [[protocol droid]]s for the next fifteen [[Standard year|years]] on a derelict [[starship]] in the middle of [[Wild Space]] before being rescued by a [[Galactic Republic]] [[cruiser]] at the age of twenty. As a result, Maripher's behavior and mannerisms were distinctly unusual. Although he had a trademark bad attitude, Maripher was a loyal friend and had a good heart.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nMaripher and Wick traveled to the [[planet]] [[Pijal]], where they looked to profit off of [[kohlen crystal]]s, which could pass as [[kyber crystal]]s to the unexperienced eye. However, shortly into their venture on [[Pijal's moon]], they were approached by [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan|apprentice]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Maripher tried to resist speaking with them, pretending his shovel was in fact a [[blaster]] and refusing to lower his \"weapon,\" but Wick called him out and allowed the Jedi onboard their ship, the ''[[Meryx]]''. Although Maripher was unhappy about collaborating with the Jedi, Wick agreed to help the two [[Jedi]] search for signs of the [[Opposition]], a terrorist group that was causing trouble on Pijal. Later, he helped break Wick out of enslavement by [[Czerka Arms|Czerka Corporation]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|As he grew up, his only patterns of behavior were set by characters that behaved like C-3PO!|Claudia Gray about Pax Maripher|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-master-apprentice-claudia-gray-interview}}\nPax Maripher first appeared in the [[canon]] novel ''[[Master & Apprentice]]'', which was written by [[Claudia Gray]] and published in [[2019]].<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Gray imagined Maripher as being portrayed by actor [[Wikipedia:Shaun Evans|Shaun Evans]].<ref name=\"Tumblr\">{{Tumblr|tumblrurl=claudiagray|url=post/184227180172/im-just-now-leaving-chicago-after-celebration|tumblrname=Claudia Gray's Photo Blog|postname=Claudia Gray|quote=Shaun Evans as Pax Maripher|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416223629/http://claudiagray.tumblr.com/post/184227180172/im-just-now-leaving-chicago-after-celebration}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with [[StarWars.com]], Gray described the process of creating Maripher, stating that he and his partner Wick were based on the dynamic of the characters from the [[Wikipedia:Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]] television series [[Wikipedia:Elementary (TV series)|''Elementary'']].
