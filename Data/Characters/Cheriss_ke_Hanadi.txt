She served as [[Red Flight]]'s ([[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], [[Tycho Celchu]], [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]], and [[Derek Klivian/Legends|Derek Klivian]]) guide during their time on [[Adumar/Legends|Adumar]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|My mother worked at a food-processing plant until brownlung killed her. I worked there for a season before I was well established enough to make my living with my blastsword.|Cheriss ke Hanadi to Wedge Antilles|Adumar: Pilots Wanted}}\nA native of the dominating Adumari state of [[Cartann]], Cheriss had long-admired the skill and tenacity of fighter pilots (figures of immense respect in Adumari culture) but Cheriss herself was unable to complete pilot training due to chronic [[vertigo]]. Instead, Cheriss took up the dying art of [[blastsword]] dueling to escape what almost amounted to indentured servitude in Cartann's underground factories. Her [[Cheriss ke Hanadi's mother|mother]] was killed by [[brownlung]], a disease contracted in the factories. Cheriss herself worked in the factories for a season longer, until she could make her living solely through the blastsword, and then through endorsements of blastswords. She ignored most of the normal stylistic conventions of blastsword dueling, favoring the styles from the blastsword's prominence in [[Standard year/Legends|years]] past. This gave her a reputation as a \"gutter fighter\" and earned the enmity of some nobles, but she nonetheless earned great popularity simply because she almost always won.\n\n===Official guide to Red Flight===\n{{Quote|I want to be a pilot. Not for Cartann; not for Adumar. For your New Republic.|Cheriss ke Hanadi to Wedge Antilles|Adumar: Pilots Wanted}}\nBy the time of the New Republics' rediscovery of Adumar, Cheriss had become the planets' Ground Champion thanks to her blastsword skills. The [[Perator]] [[Pekaelic ke Teldan]] appointed Cheriss the official guide for the New Republics' pilot-ambassador group- which included [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]]. Cheriss developed somewhat of a crush on Antilles, and was herself crushed when she found he and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]] became a couple. She then took on blastsword challenge after challenge, until she was on the brink of [[Death/Legends|death]]. Wes Janson stepped in and prevented her opponent from killing her, while [[Derek Klivian/Legends|Derek Klivian]] summoned a medical team from the Star Destroyer [[Allegiance (Imperial I-class)]]. While undergoing treatment, Cheriss mentioned her vertigo condition to the doctors- who discovered a chemical imbalance in her bloodstream that could be treated with medication. Cured at last, Cheriss soon apologized to Antilles and joined his rogue Red Flight to resist the dictatorial onslaught of Perator Pakaelic against the \"lesser nations.\" Cheriss was a member of the ground team [[Holdout Team]] that recovered the New Republic pilots' stolen [[T-65A3 X-wing starfighter]]s and a secret entrance to the Perators' palace- which led Pakaelic to resign in disgrace upon capture.\n\n===Pilot training===\n{{Quote|Cheriss is a great pilot. Only that vertigo was holding her back. In fact, in another few years she'll be able to outfly me in an A-wing.|Tycho Celchu regarding Cheriss ke Hanadi|Adumar: Pilots Wanted}}\nWith the [[Battle of Adumar]] concluded and her blastsword endorsement cancelled upon her defeat, Cheriss would go on to enlist in [[New Republic Starfighter Command/Legends|New Republic Starfighter Command]] and become one of that body's most renowned [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]] combat instructors. She later served as a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] in [[Moonlight Squadron]], an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor/Legends|A-wing]] group off ''[[Mon Casima]]''.\n\n===Second Galactic Civil War===\nIn [[40 ABY]] Cheriss was likely one of the half dozen pilots who accompanied [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] to the abandoned Imperial outpost on the Endor moon to where [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] had relocated the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]] in opposition to [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]]. She later flew as [[Rakehell Squadron|Rakehell Eight]] in [[Battle of Centerpoint Station (Second Galactic Civil War)|combat]] near [[Centerpoint Station]]. When Rogue Squadron attacked the Rakehells, her fighter was destroyed. She survived, however, and in [[43 ABY]], two years after the end of [[Second Galactic Civil War|the war]], she was among the many pilots who went to [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] to help [[Mission to save Kessel|save the planet]] from destruction.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040401adumarmain|text=Adumar: Pilots Wanted|int=Adumar: Pilots Wanted|archivedate=20100325071306}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Cheriss ke Hanadi\n|es=Cheriss ke Hanadi\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ke Hanadi, Cheriss}}\n[[Category:Adumari]]\n[[Category:Duelists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Coalition personnel]]\n[[Category:New Republic Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Rakehell Squadron personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
