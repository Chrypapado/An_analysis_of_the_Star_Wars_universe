One brutal training method required Maul to memorize star systems and planets, and failure to complete it in a set time resulted in an electric shock. One day, the droid took Maul out of his room, and eventually started to chase the [[Zabrak/Legends|Zabrak]]. Maul ran into a hallway and into a private room, which belonged to [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]]. The droid was damaged, and when the droid entered the room where Sidious and Maul were talking, he was ordered away where he would fix himself.<ref name=\"Wrath\" />\n\nThe droid would continue to supervise Maul's training throughout the years. At one point, Maul used the Force on a staff, and TD-D9 hurried to inform Lord Sidious who was quite pleased with the result. He would then take Maul to [[Tosste/Legends|Tosste]] where he would train him to harness the Force. A short time later, the droid lowered and tied a upside down Maul to a vat of acid. Maul would attempt to break free while Sidious gave him a history of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]]. Sidious, displeased with the time Maul took to break free, had the droid make Maul repeat the challenge, but would lower him much quicker.<ref name=\"Wrath\" />\n\nSoon, Maul would see a softer side of the droid, when he apologized for accidentally breaking his ribs during a training session, and even expressed some form of humor, by imitating Darth Sidious's voice, and warmth by telling Maul to call him by '''Deenine'''.\nMaul soon began to think of the droid as his friend, who lied to Sidious saying that he lied to Maul about the rib breaking being an accident, when it in fact was an accident; only saying that as to not incur Sidious's wrath.<ref name=\"Wrath\" />\n\nMaul would be given a large room, and one day the droid noticed Maul had drawn an image of Mustafar on the wall. The droid cautioned Maul and told him to get rid of it before Sidious could find it, however, Sidious did, and he summoned Maul. When arrived, Sidious spoke with Maul and kept the droid nearby. On Sidious's command, TD-D9 activated a lever which plunged Maul to the terrain of the volcanic world.<ref name=\"Wrath\" />\n\nUnfortunately, at the end of Maul's first level of training and departure to [[Orsis]], Sidious had TD-D9 serve him and Maul dinner, then used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to throw him against the wall, destroying him.<ref name=\"Wrath\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Restraint]]'' {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Wrath of Darth Maul]]'' {{1st}} {{1stID}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=TD-D9\n|pt=TD-D9\n}}\n\n[[Category:Mustafar residents]]\n[[Category:Training droids]]"}}}]}}}}
