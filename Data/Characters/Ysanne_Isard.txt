In the time I have been associated with you I have found you to be sociopathically self-centered, prone to irrational and impulsive reactions to situations, and prey to a preference for appearance over substance. I have no doubt these affectations were seen as skills by the late Emperor, and indeed may have enhanced your ability to comply with his orders, but by no means are these traits that make for great, or even ''adequate'' leadership.|Captain Sair Yonka of the Star Destroyer ''Avarice'' announces his defection from Isard's empire|X-Wing: The Bacta War}}\n'''Ysanne Isard''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who served as the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] for several years during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], and ruled the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] herself for a time after the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor's]] death in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]. Isard followed her father, [[Armand Isard/Legends|Armand Isard]], into [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] at a young age, blossoming into a model field agent. After the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] stole coordinates of the location of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star's]] construction site, Ysanne was sent on a mission to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Darkknell/Legends|Darkknell]]. While the mission was a failure, she survived but the prospect of losing considerable face back on Imperial Center infuriated Isard. She instead found a way to pin the blame on her father. Backed up by members of the [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guards]], she accused her father of [[Treason/Legends|treason]]; the Emperor had him executed within the hour, and she took her father's position as Director of Imperial Intelligence. Isard was exceptionally close to [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]], so much so that she was given the second [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class]] [[Star Dreadnought/Legends|Star Dreadnought]] constructed, the ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]''. Buried underneath the surface of her [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], the ''Lusankya'' became a [[Prison/Legends|prison]] and brainwashing facility, and Isard used it to [[Torture/Legends|torture]] the secrets out of many enemies of the Empire, as well as convert selected prisoners into sleeper agents.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Isard became an [[Advisor/Legends|advisor]] to [[Grand Vizier/Legends|Grand Vizier]] [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]], all the while engineering his downfall. In the same day, Isard had Pestage and the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Ruling Council]] assassinated, leaving her Empress in all but name. Isard commanded a sizable force at the height of her power, though the fact she held Coruscant made her a target for the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Knowing Coruscant would inevitably fall to the New Republic, she had the [[Krytos virus]] developed, so that they would inherit a sick world and hopefully fragment. Isard would eventually make contact with [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn]], who, was within the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] maintaining his [[Empire of the Hand|shadow empire]]. After [[Mission above Imperial City|blasting off]] Coruscant in the ''Lusankya'', Ysanne Isard supported a political coup of [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferra]], and became a [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]]. [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] followed her to Thyferra, though, and managed to defeat her forces and [[Battle of Thyferra|capture the planet]]. Isard was presumed dead.\n\nShe had, in fact, survived, and remained in hiding during the [[Thrawn campaign]], biding her time and contemplating past mistakes. Sometime during her time in hiding, she was contacted by the reborn Palpatine, and pledged to steal back her ''Lusankya'' and present it to him. When [[Ysanne Isard (clone)|her clone]] allied herself with warlord [[Delak Krennel]] and reemerged in the [[Ciutric Hegemony]], Isard provided Rogue Squadron with the location of the ''Lusankya'' prisoners, among them Rebel Alliance [[General/Legends|General]] [[Jan Dodonna/Legends|Jan Dodonna]], to discreetly obtain their aid in eliminating her clone. She betrayed the New Republic, though, and attempted to steal the ''Lusankya'' from New Republic control at the [[Bilbringi system|Bilbringi]] shipyards. However, a New Republic Intelligence agent, [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]], was waiting for her and shot her dead.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|The Isards make their own luck.|Ysanne Isard|Interlude at Darkknell}}\n[[File:YoungIsard-EAP18.png|thumb|left|200px|Ysanne Isard in 18 BBY.]]\nYsanne Isard was born into a wealthy and influential [[Isard family|family]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> in approximately [[30 BBY/Legends|30 BBY]],<ref name=\"birthdate\" /> during the waning days of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Her father, [[Armand Isard/Legends|Armand Isard]], was the [[Director of the Senate Bureau of Intelligence]], becoming the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] when the Republic was reformed into the first [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]. The Isards flourished under [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] rule, possessing far more power and prestige than during the time of the Republic.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> Ysanne was born with heterochromia iridium,<ref name=\"Evasive Action: Prey\">''[[Evasive Action: Prey]]''</ref> possessing one red and one blue eye, though her features were said to be otherwise attractive.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> She was raised on Coruscant<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\">''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''</ref> and grew up in the Emperor's Court;<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> as a young child, she idolized her father, boasting of his power to anyone that would listen. Armand Isard saw fit to allow his young daughter to accompany him to work, and had no qualms about her being in the presence of dangerous individuals like [[High Inquisitor]] [[Antinnis Tremayne]]; others did, however, and often questioned the presence of a child in high-security areas. During the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]], Ysanne went with her father to Imperial facilities on Coruscant often, though she displayed little awareness of his work: aiding Palpatine's [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] in hunting down [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] fugitives.<ref name=\"Evasive Action: Prey\" /> She was also known to attend Imperial party receptions with her father, rarely leaving his side.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\nAny na\u00efvet\u00e9 present in Ysanne Isard was gone by the time she reached adolescence, when the coldness and ambition she inherited from her father began to manifest itself. Armand began training his daughter from a very young age as a field operative, hoping for her to follow in his footsteps and gain a position in [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]]. Ysanne was incredibly ambitious, and, after flourishing and growing into an expert field agent, she began to plot her ascension behind his back. She did not take advantage of her father's position,<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> using her own talents&mdash;augmented by her vigor and ruthlessness when dealing with enemies of the Empire&mdash;to rise above her peers. She built up a plethora of contacts and alliances within Imperial Intelligence, who were able to help her in acquiring information that her rank did not allow her; despite the most stringent of security procedures, she managed to find out about the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] project at least a year before it was officially announced. From a young age, Ysanne developed a close personal devotion to the Emperor,<ref name=\"Darkknell\" /> and found his power and charisma attractive; she eventually came to love him.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> By the time she was in her twenties, Isard had become one of the best field agents among Imperial Intelligence.<ref name=\"EGW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:CrossAndIsard-AEHT1.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Imperial Intelligence [[Agent/Legends|agents]] Isard and [[Jahan Cross|Cross]], in [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]].]]\nIsard had a multitude of fellow agents who acted as her back-up on assignments; although she was a capable and cunning operative, Ysanne lacked physical strength, which these men provided in abundance.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" /> In addition, she also personally led a brute squad composed of former stormtrooper NCOs&mdash;men who had been chosen for their physique rather than their intelligence. She along with the rest of her squad specialized in \"dagger and fist\" missions. The male members of her squad were also widely rumored to be her lovers in addition to her muscle. Although these rumors were unsubstantiated, it was known that Isard had little time for a conventional social life due to being completely dedicated to the structure of the New Order.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Isard saw agents such as [[Jahan Cross]] to be cheaper than hired guns, such as the bounty hunter, [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]].<ref name=\"AotE:HT1\">''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]''</ref> In [[3 BBY/Legends|3 BBY]], Ysanne ran into Cross outside the office of Armand. She revealed to him that his mission to assassinate [[Adan Dooku]] wasn't done because the Count was an enemy of the Empire, but rather done at the request of power hungry factions in [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno's]] government.<ref name=\"AotE:HT1\" />\n\nBy [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Ysanne was one of the foremost field agents of her time, and Armand was proud to have her as his daughter. He nevertheless felt threatened by her ambition, especially due to her and her brute squad's departure from his own policy of subtle and civilized ruthlessness.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Fearing that she would attempt to overthrow him as director, the elder Isard decided to rid himself of her threat.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\n===Mission to Darkknell===\n{{Quote|I have an important job for you.''\"<br />\"''How important?''\"<br />\"''It could be a career-maker for you. It also could be a career-breaker for a large number of others.|Armand Isard with his daughter just prior to the mission to Darkknell|Interlude at Darkknell}}\nOne year before the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Ysanne Isard was summoned by her father to meet with him in his office, where he outlined the parameters for her next mission, to the world of [[Darkknell/Legends|Darkknell]]. Agents of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] had managed to steal a set of [[Datacard/Legends|datacards]] containing coordinates to the exact location of the Death Star's construction site at [[Despayre]], and a transfer between Alliance agents was due to take place on Darkknell. Isard was tasked with retrieving the datacards, capturing the Rebel agent sent to pick them up, and identifying the traitor who had stolen them, though the datacards were by far the most important part of her mission. Ysanne was not permitted to take the usual full complement of Intelligence forces with her due to the secrecy of the mission, though her father allowed her to take one of her most trusted enforcers&mdash;a hulking man named [[Trabler]]&mdash;to assist her.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\nActing under the false identity of [[Darkknell Special Security]] agent [[Katya Glasc]], Isard passed through Darkknell's customs, heading immediately to the capital city of [[Xakrea]]. She knew that the Rebel would be taking refuge among the fringe population of Xakrea, and planned to visit any individual who provided identity-changing services. Knowing that anyone who would provide him with a new identity would sell her his real identity, she had Trabler drive her to each establishment in turn, starting with [[Arky's Emporium of Forgotten Treasures]]. Once there, she encountered [[Hal Horn]], a high-ranking [[Corellian Security Force]] officer, and enlisted his help in searching for the Rebel. Horn was searching for a criminal, [[Moranda Savich]], who Isard claimed to have caught sight of. She ushered the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] out of the building, revealing no details about Savich, and guided him back to her rented [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]]. En route, they saw Moranda Savich speaking with Trabler; Isard ordered her enforcer to shoot the woman. With Savich dead, Horn was in Isard's debt, though he initially refused to help her in hunting down Rebels. She used the recently reported death of Horn's fellow Corellian [[Garm Bel Iblis]] against him, claiming that as the Rebel they were hunting had killed Bel Iblis, it was Horn's duty as a Corellian to help her track him down. She claimed that Bel Iblis was a loyal Imperial, though in truth his assassination had been ordered by Armand Isard because of the Corellian's anti-Imperial tendencies.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\nIsard visited various criminal establishments all over Xakrea, trying to force information pertaining to the Rebel Alliance out of them, though none of the meetings proved fruitful. Horn, clearly recognizing Ysanne and her bodyguard as citizens of Imperial Center, became suspicious of them, and secretly sought to find an opportunity to abandon them and return to Corellia. Eventually, in a cantina named the [[Continuum Void]], Isard learned that the subject of one of the [[holograph]]s of suspected Rebels had had something extremely valuable stolen from him earlier in the day. The [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] barman could not identify the thief, though he told them that it was a brown-haired [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]]. Knowing that Moranda Savich was a well-known thief, she secretly had Trabler check local police and hospital records to find out if they had recovered Savich; Isard then led Hal Horn back to her safehouse.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\n[[File:Ysanne_Isard_NEGTC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ysanne Isard.]]\n\nHorn had outlived his usefulness, and Isard suspected that he had attempted to hide Savich's role in the theft of the datacards, for reasons unknown. After Trabler reported back and informed her that Savich did not show up on any local hospital or police records, she had him travel to the safehouse before they reached it, ready to ambush the CorSec officer. Horn was able to defend himself from Trabler's crude blows, however, and managed to incapacitate him and steal his blaster. He and Isard exchanged several blaster bolts, all of which barely missed their intended targets, before Trabler resurfaced. Horn was again too quick for the man, stabbing him with a hidden [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]]. Her enforcer killed, Isard had no choice but to listen to Horn, who destroyed a holograph of Moranda Savich&mdash;the only conclusive means Isard had of identifying her. Horn confirmed that it had been Savich who had stolen the datacards from the Rebel at the Continuum Void cantina, and offered to help Isard track her down in exchange for his life. Knowing Horn was her only chance at recovering the datacards, Isard agreed to his proposition, on the condition that Horn wear a [[choke-collar]]. The irremovable device would cut off the blood flow to the Corellian's neck and kill him at Isard's command, or else whenever she perished. Horn agreed to this, and allowed the field operative to fix the collar to his neck.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\nWith few leads to follow, Horn deduced that the Continuum Void was their best bet for locating Moranda Savich, as it stocked [[Gralish liqueur]], a favorite beverage of hers. Once there, however, Savich was nowhere to be seen, and the barman was also missing&mdash;Horn theorized that Savich had sent him elsewhere, tying up a loose end which could lead Isard to her. They also learned that she was acting with an accomplice&mdash;either a Rebel agent or a fellow criminal. Initially, Ysanne suspected that [[Seb Arkos]], the owner of Arky's Emporium of Forgotten Treasures, was the accomplice, though Horn, who'd had dealings with Arkos previously, told her that the [[Information broker/Legends|information broker]] was unlikely to get himself involved with anything as serious as Savich's situation. Isard planned to track down the manager of the cantina and listen to whatever story Savich had spun him; from there, they could backtrack through it and find another lead to the thief and her accomplice.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\nThis was, however, a ploy by Savich intended to distract Isard, while the criminal found the highest bidder for the datacards. Midway through their search for the barman's known associates, the two noticed several occurrences of Darkknell defense airspeeders speeding through the city's streets, which they suspected were related to the Rebel agents running amok. Isard decided to abandon their previous strategy and return to the safe-house, where she could tap into local records to find out what the defense airspeeders were up to. Once there, she was able to confirm that the airspeeders were responding to Savich; almost immediately afterwards, Horn received a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] message from the woman, who told Isard that she would hand over the datacards for one million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], and nothing less. Savich told them to meet her with the money at a nearby warehouse, where she hoped Isard and local defense forces would have an auction of sorts. Isard, however, hacked into the local files once again, sending the entire Darkknell security force on a non-existent training exercise to the nearest [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]]. They were then interrupted by a woman named [[Moranda Savich|Allyse Conroy]]&mdash;actually Savich in disguise&mdash;who claimed to be an old friend of Horn's. When Darkknell Defense Agency officer [[Nyroska]] arrived, Savich claimed that ''she'' was Ysanne Isard, and that Isard and Horn were Rebel agents. With Isard unable to provide proper identification, Nyroska took Savich's word for it, and had all of them transported to his headquarters. Savich managed to escape soon after Ysanne showed them her identification; the datacards had made their way into [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma's]] hands, and Isard had failed in her mission.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\n===Rise to power===\n{{Quote|I had expected this someday, you know, Ysanne.''\"<br />\"''Of course; I am your daughter. It's over for you now, father, but fear not. The Isard legacy is in very good hands.|Armand and Ysanne's last exchange to each other|Interlude at Darkknell}}\nThe prospect of losing considerable face back on Imperial Center infuriated Isard, so she instead found a way to pin the blame on her father. She eventually found her opportunity when she uncovered evidence that her father planned to overthrow the Emperor.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Upon her return, Armand told his daughter that she would not be executed for her failure. Rather than express gratitude, however, Ysanne launched a stinging attack against Armand, claiming he knowingly sent her on a suicide mission, that he was a member of the Rebel Alliance, and that he had prevented the assassination of Garm Bel Iblis from succeeding. Backed up by members of the [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guards]], she accused her father of treason;<ref name=\"Darkknell\" /> the Emperor had him executed within the hour.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> It was rumored that Ysanne herself fired the shot that killed him, though this was unverified.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nIsard almost immediately took the reins of Imperial Intelligence from her father, replacing him as Director. Now that she had finally achieved the power she craved, she put all her effort into pleasing Emperor Palpatine, the only person who mattered.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> Isard ruled through the careful use of fear, making sure to let her subordinates know that if they failed she would have them severely punished. While this did not engender loyalty, it worked to keep her minions in line.<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\">''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]''</ref> Sometimes, though rarely, Ysanne used rewards for good performances as a way to motivate those under her command. She was rarely able to keep her anger under control, however, and any promotions handed out were frequently rescinded.<ref name=\"Mara\">''[[Star Wars: Mara Jade \u2013 By the Emperor's Hand]]''</ref> Officially, her power was circumscribed by the [[Ubiqtorate/Legends|Ubiqtorate]], a group of powerful advisors, although she did not argue with it. In actuality, her real purpose was to monitor the behavior of those of the Ubiqtorate members.\n\n[[File:IsardPalpy.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Isard conferring with Palpatine at one of his elaborate feasts.]]\n\nIsard made many suggestions to the Emperor about how he might rule his Empire more effectively, and he provided her with whatever resources were necessary to achieve her means.<ref name=\"FF\">''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 110]]''</ref> One of her suggestions was to build a prison center which could also act as a brainwashing facility. She wanted to be able to capture members of the Rebel Alliance, brainwash them into becoming sleeper agents, and send them back to their superiors, awaiting the right moment to activate them. Palpatine was impressed by her ideas, and awarded her with the second [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] known to exist. While [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] flagship [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] was constructed at [[Fondor/Legends|Fondor]], its twin was constructed at [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]]&mdash;and was also originally named ''Executor'' to conceal the existence of a second ship. For years, both shipyards claimed to have built the famous ''Executor'', but Isard re-christened her Kuati vessel as ''[[Lusankya/Legends|Lusankya]]''.<ref name=\"Bacta War\">''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''</ref> Although the exact details of how he did it would forever elude Isard, Palpatine secretly had the ship placed deep underneath the cityscape of Coruscant, using his power with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to remove it from any witnesses' memories. She also ensured that several members of the Ubiqtorate who attempted to use the Intelligence apparatus for their own ends were \"reassigned\" to the ''Lusankya''. As such, her power steadily increased until she effectively was the entire Imperial security apparatus, suppressing elite intrigues and civic unrest alike.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Around [[0 ABY/Legends|six months]] after the Battle of Yavin, Palpatine confided the location of her new facility to her, at the same time that Vader's [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] became operational. Isard's first prisoner was [[General/Legends|General]] [[Jan Dodonna/Legends|Jan Dodonna]] of the Rebel Alliance, the man responsible for the plan to destroy the Death Star.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> Dodonna became a leader figure among Isard's prisoners, who were made up largely of his fellow Rebels, but also of ineffectual officers or personal enemies of Isard's.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\">''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''</ref> Overall, the Super Star Destroyer took in millions of inmates,<ref name=\"FF\" /> and it ultimately served its purpose well; the thought of the shadowy \"Lusankya\" facility struck fear into most Rebels' hearts, with many sleeper agents being successfully deployed among the ranks of the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\">''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''</ref> Much of her time was taken up dealing with the Rebel Alliance&mdash;Isard took them far more seriously than Palpatine did, but was unable to bend his opinion on the matter.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> Although Isard was feared by many, ultimately most carried out her orders out of respect, and not simply fear.<ref name=\"PH\">''[[Coruscant: Center of the Empire]]''</ref> Isard was also referred to as an [[Admiral/Legends|admiral]] by some.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\">''[[Red Sky, Blue Flame]]''</ref>\n\nWhile most of her work was done in secret, Ysanne was occasionally called upon by the Empire to perform more public actions. On at least one occasion, she personally thanked civilians on behalf of the Empire, such as [[Garik Loran]], a child [[Holovid/Legends|holovid]] actor who starred in Imperial propaganda films.<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\" /> At some point during her tenure as Director, Isard was responsible for naming a new prison on Coruscant; she named it the [[Armand Isard Correctional Facility]], after her father.<ref name=\"outcast\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''</ref> Palpatine also had her spy on close confidants to gauge their loyalty at some of the Emperor's elaborate parties, which she regularly attended. At one such event, Isard learned of [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], one of the [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hands]]. As she could not find an ounce of information on Jade, Isard immediately marked her as a potential enemy, and questioned Palpatine about her loyalty. Palpatine had no fears about Mara Jade, though, and told Isard he feared betrayal from ''her'' more than Jade. Furious, Isard held an intense personal grudge against Jade, one she made no attempt to hide.<ref name=\"Mara\" />\n\nSometime during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], one of Isard's agents, a man named [[Vune Willic]], was framed for attempting to assassinate Emperor Palpatine at the [[Galactic Games/Legends|Galactic Games]] on Imperial Center. His attempts were foiled, and Isard had him imprisoned, and scheduled his execution. It was an embarrassment to her that high-ranking Imperial officials plotted to kill Palpatine, though she was able to smooth things over in the end by framing him in their place to downplay the threat. Willic was given a dose of truth serum, and Isard got a chance to test out the new [[YI-5 Surveillance/Interrogation droid|YI-5 Surveillance/Interrogation Droid]]. Vune Willic gave a clean confession for the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]], and Isard had him killed the next day.<ref name=\"PH\" />\n\nAround this time, some Imperial counterintelligence agents intercepted a transmission from [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], one of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance, in which Organa called upon Alliance forces to rally in three cities: [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]] on the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], [[Dearic]] on the planet [[Talus/Legends|Talus]] and [[Keren/Legends|Keren]] on the planet [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. Isard sent a [[Imperial Naval Communiqu\u00e9 31756|communiqu\u00e9]] containing a copy of the recording to senior Imperial naval officers and called for Imperial forces to be assigned to capture the three cities.<ref name=\"GCW Invasion\">{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=68702&month=032010|text=GCW Invasion Planets - Talus|archivedate=20110921181343}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Isard was also involved in the development of the [[Conqueror (superlaser)|''Conqueror'']], an [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] equipped with a superlaser, much like the one on the Death Star. After the construction of the ship was finished, the ''Conqueror'' was stationed in the [[Mustafar system/Legends|Mustafar system]], where a single test shot was fired with the superlaser at one of the system's uninhabited planetoids, obliterating it completely. Shortly after the test, Isard was present on [[Mustafar/Legends|Mustafar]], where she met with the [[Blackguard (Mustafar)/Legends|Blackguard]], a sect of Dark Jedi with whom the Imperial Intelligence had formed an alliance necessary to the ''Conqueror'' project. Isard and a group of Blackguard Elite Minions rode a speeder to a landing site, where supply [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttles]] from the ''Conqueror'' arrived to once a day. When they reached the site and exited the speeder, the shuttle had not arrived yet, so Isard took her time to remind the Blackguard of the utmost importance of the operation. Suddenly, a group of Rebels&mdash;members of [[Renegade Squadron/Legends|Renegade Squadron]] sent to destroy the ''Conqueror''&mdash;emerged from their cover, and a firefight ensued. Isard was outgunned, and she commanded the Blackguard to fall back. The Dark Jedi provided suppressive fire, keeping down the Rebels while Isard retreated back to the speeder. The surviving Blackguard then jumped into the speeder, and Isard fled from the site. Isard warned the ''Conqueror''{{'s}} [[Commander/Legends|commander]], Admiral [[Victor Strang]], of the impending arrival of the Rebels aboard the Star Destroyer. Nevertheless, the Rebels were able to infiltrate the ''Conqueror'' by using the supply shuttle, and they destroyed the superlaser-equipped vessel from within with explosive charges.<ref name=\"Threat of the Conqueror\">{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}</ref>\n\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Isard visited the base of [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]], leader of the [[181st Imperial Fighter Wing/Legends|181st Imperial Fighter Group]], who had caught her eye at previous functions. Isard had been sent to inform Fel of the impending attack at the Rebels' base on [[Derra IV]], orchestrated by Vader and [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]]. She attempted to seduce Fel, both sexually and with offers of promotions and power. The pilot refused to be captivated by these advances, though Isard simply claimed to have been sent by the Emperor to test his loyalty. As he had passed this test, she presented him with an offer to fly at Derra IV, Fel accepted, though for his rejection Isard had marked him as yet another enemy&mdash;something which Fel himself recognized and feared.

The Empire was left in a state of decay, and a huge power vacuum was left by Palpatine's death&mdash;one that many, including Isard, sought to fill. Infuriated by the Emperor's death and the [[Coruscant Uprising|celebrations]] on Imperial Center that followed, Isard deployed her forces and arrested hundreds of thousands of civilians celebrating the Rebellion's victory.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> Although she successfully managed to suppress the revolt, she also discovered that none of the other surviving Imperial leaders had even reacted to the protests. This led to her deciding that the other Imperial leaders are incapable of leading the New Order, and thus made plans to ensure the downfalls of Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, General Paltr Carvin, and Grand Moff Hissa.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> After overcoming the initial shock of the death of her idol, Isard saw how things could be used to her advantage. [[Grand Vizier/Legends|Grand Vizier]] [[Sate Pestage/Legends|Sate Pestage]] had taken the reins of the Empire, though his paranoia and stress made him a weak ruler; Ysanne took advantage of this, acting as a neutral party between Pestage and the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Ruling Council]], who sought to claim power for themselves. Pestage was soon eating out of Isard's hand, and she began to maneuver both his and the Council's downfall.<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>\n\nSoon after Endor, Isard's agents captured Mara Jade and the Director had her placed in captivity. After conferring with Pestage to learn as much as possible about the woman, Ysanne decided that she was too great a threat to be an ally, and began to have her brainwashed into giving Isard secrets about the Empire that she was not previously aware of. Ysanne Isard could not touch the Force, and did not give it much thought or consideration, so it was unsurprising that she underestimated Mara Jade's abilities with it. The Emperor's Hand used a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to have her interrogator release her and allow her access to a [[computer terminal]]. Isard's men detected this immediately, and she personally began to track Jade through the labyrinthine [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]]. She enlisted a tech specialist named [[Tal Burren]] to assist her in tracking Jade's movements. They eventually realized Jade was in Isard's personal office, but by the time they arrived, she was gone. The Emperor's Hand had stolen one of Isard's datapads with high level security clearance, and was using it to travel through the building unhindered. Jade had left them many false leads, ordering dozens of shuttles to various docking bays; Isard had men dispatched to each, though she herself went to her personal shuttle ''[[Lokvar]]''. Jade ultimately escaped, something which Isard took personally. She made the woman a sworn enemy, and vowed to have her thrown into the bowels of the ''Lusankya'' when they next met.<ref name=\"Mara\" /> Her agents chased Mara Jade to [[Kintoni/Legends|Kintoni]], though after that her whereabouts eluded Isard.<ref name=\"Mara Jade: A Night on the Town\">{{Tales|1|Mara Jade: A Night on the Town}}</ref>\n\nSometime after becoming Pestage's advisor, Isard discovered Palpatine's personal [[Cloning/Legends|cloning]] center deep within the Imperial Palace. She had a single [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] made of herself, before destroying the remainder of the [[Spaarti cloning cylinder]]s. The clone was kept in suspended animation in the ''Lusankya'', and Isard confided its existence to none.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> She intended to use it to perform a task she would only trust herself to do, and always planned to dispose of it.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\n[[File:IsardMJBTEP.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Isard flanked by Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]].]]\n\nOver the next several months, Isard made Pestage look incompetent to his peers in the Ruling Council, giving him bad advice and undermining his authority. She similarly isolated the [[Cabal]], causing great discord among the remnants of the Empire&mdash;all part of [[Project Ambition]]. For six months, the Rebel Alliance&mdash;now reformed as the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]&mdash;consolidated their forces, making few large-scale attacks on Imperial territory. However, Pestage began to notice the New Republic becoming more active, and he and Isard deduced that they were planning something against his Empire. Ysanne advised Pestage to leave bait for the Rebels, suggesting the world of [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] for such a trap. She chose this planet because the majority of the Ruling Council's members had holdings there, and, if everything proceeded as she had planned, would be infuriated by the inevitable loss. [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Lon Isoto]]&mdash;thought to be an incompetent fool by nearly all his superiors&mdash;was in charge of Imperial forces at Brentaal, and Pestage pointed out that to engage the New Republic with him in command would be suicide. Isard informed the Grand Vizier, however, that Isoto was staunchly supported by the Ruling Council, and any failure on his part would be their failure. Unable to resist a potential opportunity to undermine his rivals, Pestage eventually agreed, though only on the condition that the 181st Imperial Fighter Group was present. Isard, meanwhile, informed the Council that ''Pestage'' wanted to keep Isoto in place, to their fury.<ref name=\"Service\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: In the Empire's Service]]''</ref>\n\nIsard ordered Baron Fel, the leader of the 181st, to prevent planetary invasion by the New Republic, but nothing more. When they learned that Admiral Isoto was the man charged with defending Brentaal&mdash;a target of Admiral [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Ackbar's]] for months&mdash;the New Republic launched an attack, led by the [[Independence/Legends|''Independence'']], defeating preliminary Imperial forces and capturing Brentaal's [[Moon/Legends|moon]] base. Baron Fel incurred heavy losses, and, after the initial battle, told Isard of his displeasure at having his men sent to die. Isard, however, was able to keep the furious Fel in check; she had somehow learned of his relationship with [[Syal Antilles Fel|Syal Antilles]], and goaded him with the possibility of killing his brother-in-law [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], the leader of the New Republic's [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. Fel replied that he would not hesitate to kill Antilles, though, clearly caught off guard by Isard's knowledge of his secret marriage, he began to keep his complaints to himself. Isard ordered Fel and the other Imperial forces to Brentaal's surface in the wake of the next wave of the New Republic fleet.<ref name=\"Service\" />\n\nPestage was not happy at how events were playing out, though Isard managed to bring him around to her way of thinking. She had Isoto withdraw his fleet so that the Rebels could establish a base on the surface&mdash;a move which appalled the Ruling Council members. The Councilors called for Isoto's head, and pleaded with Isard to make Pestage see reason and appoint a competent officer. Simultaneously, Pestage had Ysanne meet with the Council to try to persuade them to stop supporting Isoto. Isard manipulated both parties, telling each faction that the other refused to make a change&mdash;the members of the Council then began contemplating a coup. Everything was proceeding according to plan for Isard.<ref name=\"Service\" />\n\n===Project Ambition===\n{{Quote|There, now Pestage will be mine, and after him, the Empire of my master. Nothing will stop me&hellip;|Ysanne Isard just prior to the beginning of Project Ambition|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement}}\nWith the largest battle to date just hours away, Isard was confronted by Soontir Fel through a hologram. Fel was furious at her interference, and accused her of treason. Though Isard was affronted, Fel stated that he would continue to serve the Empire loyally. Fel knew of Isard's plan to impress local rulers; although she would allow the world to fall, she would evacuate the nobles before the Rebels could capture them, gaining her immense favor in their eyes. After the next wave of fighting went poorly for the Empire, Isard issued clearance orders to dispatch an evacuation fleet to Brentaal, overriding Pestage's previous orders. Irate, the Grand Vizier confronted her over this, though, as usual, she was able to bend his opinion into line with hers. Pestage had finally realized that she was manipulating him, though, and began planning his defection to the New Republic.<ref name=\"Service\" />\n\nIsard personally gave Isoto the order to evacuate; once he had expended his usefulness, she had [[Grania (Brentaali)|Grania]], a spy of Isard's who acted as Isoto's concubine, kill him.<ref name=\"Service\" /> The loss of Brentaal IV pushed the Cabal over the edge, and they vowed to oust Pestage in the near future. Meanwhile, both Sate Pestage and Soontir Fel disappeared&mdash;Fel had defected to the New Republic, and Pestage was in hiding.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" /> Isard sent agents after Fel's wife, Syal Antilles Fel, though they failed to capture her.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref> Isard was letting out her frustration in combat simulators when she was informed that [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] Leia Organa and an aide had been kidnapped on [[Eiattu 6]]. Isard theorized that she could either have been kidnapped, or whisked away for a meeting with Pestage. Either way, she vowed to find Pestage and punish him for his cowardice. It was reported that rogue [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Leonia Tavira]] was holding Leia captive; Isard sent the [[Reckoning (Imperial II-class)|''Reckoning'']] to the planet [[Axxila/Legends|Axxila]] to recover both Tavira and Organa. She planned to use both of them as sleeper agents against her enemies after first interrogating them, but things went poorly, and Leia was able to escape with the help of Rogue Squadron. Pestage returned from his absence, and although Isard firmly believed he had been meeting with Leia, she had no evidence to back up her claim.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" />\n\n[[File:YsanneIsard.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Isard speaks with the Imperial Ruling Council.]]\n\nWith Pestage showing more and more signs of having made a pact with the Rebels, Isard made her case before the Ruling Council, claiming that Pestage had committed treason and urging his ouster. When Pestage disappeared once again, Isard put out an Imperial arrest warrant for him, though the effort was unnecessary. Leonia Tavira had found Pestage, and was holding him captive on the planet [[Ciutric IV]]; Isard attempted to bargain with her for Pestage's life, though the Moff's demands were far too high, and, knowing Pestage's location, Isard refused. She sent several specialist agents to Ciutric to retrieve him, though the cabal had other ideas. They dispatched Admiral [[Delak Krennel]]&mdash;the man responsible for the debacle at Axxila&mdash;and his [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] to Ciutric. Isard was infuriated, though her superiors were adamant. They did, however, permit her to travel to Ciutric to oversee proceedings personally. Isard's number one goal, after killing Pestage, had now become to rid the Empire of the cabal, whose interference was becoming more frequent.<ref name=\"Retire\">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''</ref>\n\nIsard traveled directly to the ''Reckoning''{{'s}} bridge to meet with Krennel face-to-face. After they exchanged subtle insults, Isard forcefully told him to back off, to do nothing and allow her people to capture Pestage. She offered him protection from the cabal, as well as money and promotions, if he worked for her instead of them, though it took the offer of the ''[[Binder]]'', an [[Interdictor-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Interdictor Star Destroyer]], to finally sway him. Isard returned to Coruscant while Krennel led another team on the surface, though by the time they reached Pestage's holding place, the Grand Vizier had been whisked away by Rogue Squadron. However, the ''Binder'' would prevent any ships from entering [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] and leaving the system, which gave Krennel a decent chance of catching up with Rogue Squadron and claiming Pestage.<ref name=\"Retire\" />\n\nOn Imperial Center, Isard was reprimanded severely for disobeying orders; the cabal held her responsible for the Rebels' capture of Pestage, though her decision to bring in the ''Binder'' spared her a sacking. She made contact once again with Krennel, this time via hologram, despite being told not to interfere in matters. Isard knew that if Pestage fell into the hands of the Ruling Council, he would tell them of her treasonous actions, and she would face prosecution, so she was desperate to have him retrieved and returned to her. She told Krennel of her plans to assassinate the Council members, offering him a position as Emperor if he could succeed capturing Pestage for her.<ref name=\"Retire\" />\n\nWhile Krennel was dealing with Pestage, Isard initiated the later stages of Project Ambition, with Tribune [[Challer]] the first to die. Ysanne once again had a man's mistress pull the trigger, though this time she had her agent make no attempt to cover up the killing. She had [[Plumba]] killed next, before learning that Krennel had succeeded in finding Pestage. Rather than bring him back alive as agreed, Krennel murdered Pestage, and claimed his holdings, the Ciutric Hegemony, for himself. Isard then had General [[Paltr Carvin]], the acting leader of the cabal, sent to the ''Lusankya''; the Ruling Council was now devoid of leadership, and Isard was Empress all but in name.<ref name=\"Retire\" /> Although she kept the Ruling Council as is, it was solely as a notional legislature, and effectively toothless. She also began having the [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guard]] accompany her as a visible symbol of her acceptance as the quasi-Empress of what remained of the New Order hierarchy.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\n===Asserting her power===\n{{Quote|My wish is the death of this Rebellion. Now with the Empire in my hands, there will be no one to stop me from making that wish come true.|Ysanne Isard|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement}}\nAlthough Isard was in power, the Empire was beginning to crumble under New Republic attacks, as well as the ever more frequent secession of [[Warlord/Legends|warlords]]. Eight months after the Battle of Endor, Admiral Ackbar led another campaign which pushed on Imperial territory, frightening Isard into recalling hundreds of warships to defend Coruscant and other key [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]], which she suspected Ackbar was planning to attack. In doing so, Isard lost the [[Black Fleet]] in a disastrous debacle at [[Cal-Seti]]; among the ships lost was the Super Star Destroyer [[Intimidator (Executor-class)|''Intimidator'']]. Although many of the highest ranked individuals in the Imperial navy were loyal to Isard&mdash;including [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> [[Miltin Takel]] and [[Afsheen Makati]]<ref name=\"Who\">{{InsiderCite|66|Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals}}</ref>&mdash;many sought to topple Isard and claim the remains of the Empire for themselves. The [[Central Committee of Grand Moffs]], led by [[Grand Moff/Legends|Grand Moff]] [[Bertroff Hissa]], proclaimed [[Trioculus]], supposedly the Emperor's son, as the latest Emperor. In an attempt to take Trioculus down, Isard had [[Zorba Desilijic Tiure]] released from prison on [[Kip]], hoping he and Trioculus would wipe each other out in a battle for Princess Leia. The New Republic dealt with Trioculus, though Isard had to take measures to deal with the troublesome [[Church of the Dark Side]], whose leader [[Rajah Ubooki|Kadann]] had proclaimed himself the Emperor.<ref name=\"NEC\" /> The Church had been formed by Pestage, and they were the only religion citizens were legally allowed to practice. In another attempt to counter them, Isard reinstated galactic freedom of religion, losing the Prophets the support of spiritually-starved citizens. [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] Afsheen Makati asked for permission from Isard to go after Kadann and kill him; she allowed him, and although he slew Kadann, he himself perished not long after.<ref name=\"Who\" /> The survivors involved in the Trioculus affair were rounded up and executed. Several months later, an Imperial [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitor]] named [[Jerec (Inquisitor)|Jerec]], supplemented by a [[Seven Dark Jedi|band]] of Dark Jedi, a Super Star Destroyer, and a hoard of financial backers, attempted to usurp her power, though she was able to neutralize the threat he presented.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> Isard's rule was never seriously threatened, largely because she held Imperial Center, with its almost invincible defenses, as well as the legitimacy it offered.<ref name=\"DB\" />\n\nDuring her time in power, she took to wearing an unadorned, crimson-colored version of an admiral's uniform.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> Because of her power, as well as her physical beauty, many officers under her command fantasized about Isard, adding to their general obedience.<ref name=\"Wraith Squadron\" /> At some point during the Galactic Civil War, Isard began an operation reprogramming IT droids, in an attempt to take down the New Republic's upper echelons, though it bore no fruit.<ref name=\"Forest Apart\">''[[A Forest Apart]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:IsardMad_copy.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Ysanne Isard on Coruscant.]]\n\nIsard kept in contact with those she saw as a genuine threat, including Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> and Emperor's Hand [[Lumiya]].<ref name=\"Evil\">''[[Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties]]''</ref> Thrawn was laying low in the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]&mdash;though Isard knew that if he made a bid for her throne he could succeed&mdash;while Lumiya's training in the Force would make her a worthy adversary. Ysanne took up a policy of appeasement with these two, offering them something in exchange for their staying put. Thrawn asked for Baron Soontir Fel, and hatched a plan to capture him from New Republic service, which Isard happily carried out.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> To keep Lumiya content, she transferred a number of Imperial Royal Guards over to her, among them [[Carnor Jax]].<ref name=\"Evil\" />\n\nIsard watched [[Ysanne Isard (clone)|her clone]] grow in the bowels of the ''Lusankya'', periodically updating its memory.<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> She ensured that, once activated, the clone would believe itself to be the true Isard, and would carry out duties exactly as she herself would.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> Some time after Jerec's failed coup, Isard was instrumental in the foiling of an attempt by the New Republic to infiltrate Coruscant. Pilot [[Tycho Celchu]] volunteered to fly a [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighter]] recovered at [[Bakura/Legends|Bakura]] to Imperial Center, though Isard uncovered the ruse and had him transferred to the ''Lusankya''. Celchu, however, was able to withstand her [[Torture/Legends|tortures]], and, frustrated, she had him sent back to the New Republic. Although she had not made him into a sleeper agent, his recollection of being in the dreaded \"Lusankya facility\" made him the target of considerable distrust among the ranks of the New Republic.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /><ref name=\"NEC\" />\n\nWith her Empire relatively stable, Isard turned her attention to the Rebel Alliance. All along, her goal had been to destroy the Rebels, and then begin to reestablish the Empire. Rogue Squadron, who had thwarted her in the past, had been reformed by Wedge Antilles midway through [[6 ABY/Legends|6 ABY]],<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> and she saw them as a dangerous enemy which needed to be snuffed out.<ref name=\"Rebellion era sourcebook\">''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''</ref> Isard tracked down [[Kirtan Loor]], an Imperial Intelligence agent operating out of [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], and had him brought to her palace on Coruscant. Loor had an eidetic memory, and was adept at many forms of interrogation and torture. After meeting with him to help evaluate and work on his weaknesses, Isard told him his task: the destruction of Rogue Squadron. Loor was a Corellian, as was the squadron leader, Wedge Antilles and one of the members, [[Corran Horn]], who had crossed Loor's path before. Isard also managed to get a spy inside the squadron. [[Erisi Dlarit]] was a [[Thyferra/Legends|Thyferran]]; as a member of the only planet that produced [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]], the New Republic selected her in the squadron for purely political reasons, and although security was tight, she managed to provide Isard with the identities of the other pilots.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\n[[File:Loor_isard.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ysanne Isard and Kirtan Loor, an Imperial Intelligence agent she ordered to destroy Rogue Squadron.]]\n\nLoor managed to track the squadrons to [[Talasea]]; his men [[Battle of Talasea|killed]] one of the Rogues, [[Lujayne Forge]], and injured several others, but were ultimately repelled by the New Republic forces on the world. The intelligence agent deduced that the New Republic were looking to capture a planet, one that would be difficult for the Empire to take back, which would act as the launch pad for an assault on Coruscant. Loor anticipated that the Rogues would strike at [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]], and took measures to intercept them. General [[Evir Derricote]] was the man in charge of Borleias, and it was his secret extra forces which helped to rout the New Republic upon their initial invasion attempt. Isard had known of Derricote's clandestine operations with [[Alderaan Biotics]], and used Loor to spy on them. After finding that Derricote would be suitable for her next project, she had him ferried to Coruscant, and assigned Loor to work with him.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" />\n\nIsard knew that, sooner or later, the New Republic would be confident enough to launch an attack on Coruscant, and knew that she did not have sufficient forces to defend it. She was resigned to losing the world, despite the fact that much of the Imperial Remnant would likely leave her if she lost it. Isard, however, was determined for the New Republic to have as much difficulty as possible after capturing the planet. She had Derricote begin to work on the [[Krytos virus]], which would only affect non-Humans; this was hoped to cause discord and animosity between the Human and non-Human population of the New Republic. She also asked for the virus to be easily cured by bacta; the New Republic would be bankrupt if they were to purchase enough bacta to cure the sick, and non-Humans would be angry at the New Republic for not curing them when they easily could.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" />\n\nWith both Loor and Derricote, absent, though, the New Republic [[Second Battle of Borleias|defeated]] forces on Borleias, making Isard's loss of Coruscant all the more imminent.<ref name=\"Rogue Squadron\" /> Isard had Derricote begin work immediately, while Erisi Dlarit kept her up to date with Rogue Squadron's movements. Just days after the battle at Borleias, Dlarit was able to give Isard information on [[Bror Jace]]'s journey to his homeworld of Thyferra, and with precise hyperspace coordinates, the Director of Imperial Intelligence had an Interdictor cruiser named the [[Corusca Rainbow|''Black Asp'']] lie in wait. She had ordered Jace to be captured alive, so that he could be introduced to the ''Lusankya'', though he ultimately had to be shot down. The man responsible, Major [[Wortin]] of the ''Black Asp'', was duly punished; he was sent to work under Thrawn in the Unknown Regions.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\n===The Krytos epidemic===\n{{Quote|Rebel forces are indeed now in control of Imperial Center.

The incubation period of the virus in development was also cause for great concern, and despite having Loor reprimand Derricote for the slow pace of his work, time was running out for the virus' development. Derricote was also having difficulty ensuring the virus was able to be transferred through the air, another of Isard's demands. She told both Derricote and Loor that, should the Rebels arrive on Coruscant before the strain was entirely completed, any and all involved in the project would have to be killed, lest they fall into Rebel hands; this served as an incentive for the two men to work harder. Isard took other measures to \"motivate\" Loor. She released information that he had killed [[Gil Bastra]], former mentor to Rogue Corran Horn, a sworn enemy of Loor's. She hoped this would give Horn extra desire to get to Coruscant and seek revenge, as well as further improve Loor's work assisting Derricote.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nThe actions of Warlord [[Zsinj]], a man some thought of as a threat to her reign, but whom Isard saw as a fool, did not help matters; his attack on the New Republic's facility on Borleias helped speed up their move for Coruscant. With information provided by Erisi Dlarit, Isard learned that the New Republic had released high profile members of [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] from Kessel and transported them to Coruscant, in a bid to distract Isard while Rogue Squadron infiltrated the planet on the ground. The New Republic made one grave error, though: releasing Moff [[Fliry Vorru]], who they hoped would keep the criminals from lashing out at citizens, too. Vorru immediately made contact with Isard, and became yet another of her underlings on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nIsard was also unhappy with some of Derricote's species selections for the virus. While having it affect the likes of the Quarren and Gamorreans made sense to Ysanne, Derricote wished to infect the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] and [[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustans]], also. She refused him any Wookiee subjects, as they were a useful [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] species, though she backed down on the Sullustan matter; Loor told her that working on a Sullustan strain of the disease would lead the way to creating a Bothan strain. With the Bothans being key members of the Rebellion, Isard wanted them severely affected by the virus.\n\nErisi Dlarit and her fellow Rogues entered Coruscant soon after the operation on Kessel, and although Isard knew their false identities and locations, she did not strike against them. She also began to leave Coruscant under-defended, further inviting the New Republic to attack. With the impending invasion on the horizon, she set a deadline of two weeks for Derricote to have a completed strain of the virus ready for insertion into the water supplies.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" />\n\nThe Rogues moved faster than Isard had anticipated. The ''Black Asp'', which had failed to capture Bror Jace previously, had defected to the New Republic, giving them a very valuable weapon: a functioning Interdictor cruiser. With the ''Black Asp''{{'s}} help, the New Republic attacked and captured Coruscant, as Isard had expected all along. Although the Krytos virus was not as deadly as she had asked for, a milder strain of it was injected into Coruscant's water, where it began to take effect. However, in their attempts to take down the shields, Rogue Squadron vaporized much of Coruscant's water supply, further diminishing the effect of the virus.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /> For his failure, Derricote was imprisoned in the ''Lusankya''.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" /> The real prize for Isard, though, was the capture of Corran Horn. Erisi Dlarit was able to give Isard full control of Horn's starfighter, and she had it flown straight into a trap. His squadron believed him dead, while Isard had him transferred to the ''Lusankya''; Tycho Celchu, now the [[Executive officer/Legends|executive officer]] of Rogue Squadron, was charged with his murder,<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /> giving both Isard and Dlarit more freedom to act. Celchu's trial was also a way for Isard to get at the New Republic government; any preferential treatment for a Human could be damaging for them, even though Celchu was thought by many to be an unwilling spy for the Empire, and thus a victim.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" />\n\n[[File:IsardCoruscant.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Ysanne Isard contemplating on Coruscant.]]\n\nAlthough Isard had long resigned herself to losing Imperial Center, she was determined to make life for the New Republic provisional council as difficult as possible. In addition to the Krytos epidemic, she had Kirtan Loor and Fliry Vorru form the [[Palpatine Counter-Insurgency Front]], which acted as an irritant for the New Republic. Meanwhile, Isard took up residence in the ''Lusankya'', and began to get to work on Corran Horn. She used flight simulators against his old squadron to try and break him, though initial simulation runs turned up inconclusive, suggesting Horn would be tough to mold into a sleeper agent. Isard persisted, though, and when the simulators failed to break him, she began to resort to more conventional methods of torture. When these failed, she had him thrown with the other ''Lusankya'' prisoners, though she was determined not to give up on the former CorSec agent.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" /> She also purged hundreds of records from Coruscant's database, to keep the identities of many of her top spies intact.<ref name=\"Dark Tide II\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref>\n\nIsard kept up the deception of being on a distant planet even with Vorru and Loor. She maintained frequent comm contact with Loor, though Vorru was generally under too much New Republic scrutiny to contact her. Vorru was now working as an agent for the New Republic&mdash;or so they thought&mdash;and he was able to provide Loor with much top-secret information, which Loor relayed on to Isard. Erisi Dlarit also kept in contact with her superior, and it was she that provided Isard with information on Rogue Squadron's latest mission. Isard chose not to act, though Kirtan Loor, who should never have seen the message in the first place, did decide to act. He had a squadron of stolen X-wings act as a false Rogue Squadron, escorting a convoy of bacta to a rendezvous point, ready to ambush the real Rogue Squadron when they arrived. The hunters became the hunted, however, when Zsinj arrived with his Super Star Destroyer and decimated the false squadron. Everything had played out exactly as Isard planned, though. She knew of Loor's plan, and leaked information to Warlord Zsinj about the convoy. The New Republic were now short of bacta, and baying for Zsinj's blood, while Loor had been caught red handed disobeying orders.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" />\n\nThings took a turn for the worse in the days that followed Zsinj's attack. Fearing possible retribution by Isard, Loor defected to the New Republic, promising to provide information to them in exchange for political immunity. She also discovered that Evir Derricote and Corran Horn had escaped from the detention facility aboard the ''Lusankya'', and sent teams of men to find them. Derricote was found dead, though Horn's whereabouts eluded her. Becoming desperate to take out Rogue Squadron, Isard had Vorru attack dozens of bacta storage sites around Coruscant, knowing the Rebels would send the Rogues to defend them. Loor's threat was neutralized, when [[Diric Wessiri]], one of many sleeper agents Isard was using to monitor the Celchu trial, shot him dead.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" /> That Diric's wife, Iella Wessiri, was forced to kill Diric afterwards was a fact that Isard found particularly delicious.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\n===The Bacta War===\n{{Quote|Do you feel, as I do, that Madam Director Isard is not viewing the same reality as we are?''\"<br />\"''Do I think she is insane?''\"<br />\"''Yes.''\"<br />\"''Quite.|Fliry Vorru and Erisi Dlarit discussing Ysanne Isard|X-Wing: The Bacta War}}\nWhen Isard learned that Horn had in fact escaped, she was forced to act quickly. The secret of the ''Lusankya''{{'s}} location had been compromised, so she had to leave Coruscant with it&mdash;far earlier than she had planned. The ''Lusankya'' burst through tons of ferrocrete, and left Coruscant, killing thousands. Erisi Dlarit returned to Isard, also, in a faked tractor beam pickup, though her fellow Rogues were quick to notice the con.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" /> Horn's escape had affected Isard greatly, and although it would take her years to realize it, she was not thinking straight in the months that followed. To Isard, Horn's escape made the ''Lusankya'' unclean, and she no longer loved and cherished it as she had before.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> Isard consolidated her forces and took the ''Lusankya'' to Thyferra, where she supported a political coup by the [[Xucphra Corporation|Xucphra]] faction, which put them in charge of the bacta cartel, and Isard became the [[Chief Operating Officer]] and [[Head of State/Legends|Head of State]] of the planet&mdash;she effectively controlled the entire bacta output in the galaxy. As she was a legitimate ruler, the New Republic would not go after her.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" />\n\nAlthough they were forbidden to go after Isard by the New Republic government, the Rogues were still desperate for their revenge on Isard. They resigned their commissions and effectively formed a band of pirates determined to kill her, though this was of little concern to Isard. Despite the constant warnings from Fliry Vorru&mdash;who was now acting in a role similar to Kirtan Loor's&mdash;Isard found their attempts laughable, and paid them little heed. Something that ''did'' worry her, though, was the fact that hordes of her operatives on Coruscant had been captured by the New Republic in the aftermath of her flight to Thyferra. Though he had been killed, Kirtan Loor had managed to provide the New Republic with much sensitive information, dealing Isard a crippling blow. Isard had Erisi Dlarit lead a newly-formed [[Thyferran Home Defense Corps|Thyferran Home Defense Force]], which would deal with the threat of [[Ashern]] terrorists, as Isard's forces were not what they once were. While she had much support when she held Coruscant, many ships had left her service after the [[Liberation of Coruscant (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Coruscant]], and she relied on only a few loyal ships and vessels borrowed from other warlords. The ''Lusankya''&mdash;which Isard wanted nothing to do with&mdash;[[Freedom|''Avarice'']], [[Errant Venture|''Virulence'']], and [[Corrupter/Legends|''Corrupter'']], respectively, were all she had left from her once-glorious armada.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" />\n\n[[File:IsardBody.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ysanne Isard]]\n\nAlthough Isard had dismissed them altogether, Wedge Antilles's band of former Rogues was doing a good job in harassing Isard's bacta shipments, hijacking several of them and handing their cargo over to needy planets before returning the freighters back to Thyferra&mdash;so they could be stocked up and raided again. While Vorru assured her they were losing little financially, Isard's pride was on the line, and with every successful raid mounted by Antilles, she lost more respect and prestige. Before long, Isard feared, she would be the laughing stock of the Empire for allowing a dozen aged starfighters to repeatedly steal from her. Vorru, though, had come up with a plan to counter and isolate the Rogues: any world that had accepted stolen bacta from Antilles would have to pay Isard for it, and shipments to random worlds would be cut. This would cause great anger and animosity towards Rogue Squadron, and, Vorru hoped, would play with their conscience. Isard, her judgment clouded by a lust for revenge, wished for a more direct approach, but Vorru managed to persuade her to have the customers of the bacta shipments provide their own protection, with their Star Destroyers only escorting them some of the way.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" />\n\nIsard gained her first victory in the [[Bacta War]] in the weeks that followed, though it was not one she had actually sanctioned. Captain [[Ait Convarion]] of ''Corrupter'' had left an entire convoy unguarded to follow several freighters which had left of their own accord. Following the ship through hyperspace, ''Corrupter'' found the last of the freighters ready to jump to hyperspace, with Rogue Squadron and their [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] allies also present. ''Corrupter'' destroyed much of the Twi'lek [[Chir'daki]] squadron, and took one of the Rogues, [[Riv Shiel]], down, too. Isard, with Vorru, traveled to the bridge of ''Corrupter'' to personally congratulate Convarion and also reprimand him for disobeying orders. She recognized that he showed considerable initiative, though Isard was angry that Convarion had lied in his report of events. As a means of testing his mettle, she asked if he would be willing to execute the families of the crews of the freighters which had defected. He reluctantly agreed, though Isard informed him that she had already dealt with the crew's families. She also ordered Convarion to deal with those planets who were too poor to afford the bacta that Antilles had presented to them.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" />\n\n===Loss of the ''Lusankya''===\n{{Quote|A month. Antilles has a month yet to live. Then, once he is eliminated, the Empire will rise again and the natural order of things will again be established.|Isard's plans for the Empire|X-Wing: The Bacta War}}\nThings took a turn for the worse with the [[Second ambush in the Graveyard|Battle of The Graveyard]] when Isard lost the ''Corrupter'' at the hands of Rogue Squadron, and a mysterious [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Valiant (Thranta-class War Cruiser)|warship]] which had joined them. Additionally, a borrowed Interdictor Cruiser named the ''[[Aggregator]]'' was withdrawn from her fleet, as [[High Admiral]] [[Treuten Teradoc]] assumed he could no longer trust her with his vessels. Isard was furious, as this made her look all the more incompetent among her peers and rivals. She held Erisi Dlarit and her Thyferran Home Guard personally responsible, as they had been tasked with defending the two ships. She dressed down Dlarit, though the young Thyferran's responses were audacious, and thoughts of execution began to enter Isard's mind. Fliry Vorru, however, stepped in, and managed to shift the blame from Dlarit. He also expressed a plan to further dwindle the Rogues' effectiveness: make an abundance of bacta available on the market. His reasoning was that then the Rogues would have no way to finance themselves, and would be ripe for the taking. Isard, however, was tired of subtle schemes and political ploys, and ordered Antilles' head. She had Vorru concentrate all his efforts on finding the Rogues' base of operations, and ordered another mass-killing of planets unable to pay for the stolen bacta granted to them.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" />\n\nIsard lost another ship not long afterwards. Captain [[Sair Yonka]] of the ''Avarice'' sent her a holo message, informing her that he had left her service to be his own master. Isard took things personally when Yonka listed each of her faults; she ordered the extermination of his family members, his mistress, and ''her'' family. The loss of the ''Avarice'' put Isard in a difficult position, as she now only had one Star Destroyer to play escort duty, assuming she didn't take the ''Lusankya'' out of orbit and leave Thyferra undefended. Isard desperately needed to locate Antilles's base, so she gave him an incentive to make a hasty attack: she publicized the slaughter over a million [[Vratix/Legends|Vratix]] workers on Thyferra. She would continue to kill two thousand a day until there were no surplus Vratix left not harvesting bacta, or until Antilles intervened.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" />\n\nIsard had soon learned of the exact location of Antilles's base&mdash;[[Yag-prime]], a supposedly uninhabited [[Space station/Legends|space station]] over [[Yag'Dhul/Legends|Yag'Dhul]]&mdash;through the efforts of one of her spies, [[Melina Carniss]], who was working for [[Talon Karrde]], one of Antilles' allies. Isard prepared the ''Virulence'' and the ''Lusankya'' to go there and snuff out this threat once and for all, though Captain [[Joak Drysso]] of the ''Lusankya'' was wary of such a tactic. He felt that leaving Thyferra undefended was asking for trouble, and noted that X-wings were hyperspace-capable vehicles. Isard brushed off the concerns, unwilling to let her chance to be rid of the Rogues slip away. What remained of Isard's fleet left for Yag'Dhul, while she stayed behind on Thyferra.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" />\n\nBefore they left, though, Isard's clone, now fully grown, was released and tasked with scattering the prisoners of the ''Lusankya''. It was a task Isard trusted no one but herself to complete, so her clone, who thought it ''was'' the real Isard, was the perfect choice for it. Isard intended to kill the clone when it had finished its job.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\n[[File:IsardMR.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Ysanne Isard, former Imperial agent.]]\n\nThe Rogues were waiting for Isard's attack, and had in fact purposely allowed Carniss to learn the location of the base, knowing she was a [[Spy/Legends|spy]]. When the ''Lusankya'' and ''Virulence'' arrived, Rogue Squadron left the system, presumably to go to Thyferra. In the debacle that followed, Joak Drysso was outsmarted and seemingly outgunned by [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Booster Terrik]], and was forced to sacrifice the ''Virulence'' so that he could return and defend Thyferra. When he arrived, however, there were no signs of an attack&mdash;Isard and her people had been tricked once again. Just after the ''Lusankya'' reverted to realspace, Sair Yonka's ''Avarice''&mdash;now renamed the ''Freedom''&mdash;arrived, along with the Rogues and their Alderaanian warship. The ''Lusankya'' was holding her own in the battle, though when the ''Virulence'' arrived, salvaged and manned by New Republic personnel, the tide had fully turned. The ''Lusankya'' surrendered and Isard was left with nothing of her former riches. She still had a trick up her sleeve, though. Isard commandeered Fliry Vorru's custom shuttle and sent out to space. After she goaded the Rogues via a comlink, they believed her to be in it, and gave chase. Tycho Celchu fired the shot that took it down.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" /> The New Republic thought Isard dead, so she was able to recount her losses and remain in hiding. The fact that she was busy fighting off Antilles meant that her clone, which she had hoped to kill once its job had been completed, survived Isard's attempt to kill it, and went into hiding.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nIsard was surprised that no one in the New Republic second-guessed her death; they assumed that she had been in the shuttle, and did not follow up with an investigation.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> In the years that followed, the only person to theorize that she may have still been alive was [[Wraith Squadron]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] Garik Loran, but no investigation ever took place.<ref name=\"Solo Command\">''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''</ref> Approximately two months after her supposed death,<ref name=\"FF\" /> Isard made her way to a secret Imperial base under the command of a General named [[Arnothian]], whom she killed and replaced. The facility contained two squadrons of [[TIE/D Defender]]s, led by [[Broak Vessery]]: [[Interloper Squadron]] and [[Stranger Squadron]]. While Isard knew she could use it to launch a campaign of terror on the New Republic, she chose not to, preferring to bide her time and brood over past mistakes. She also secretly assembled various Loyalists and warlords who had continued the advance of the New Republic in spite of the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Eventually, Isard recovered from the trauma of Corran Horn's escape from the ''Lusankya'', and was again able to think without being misguided by lust for vengeance.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> After several months in hiding, Isard learned that Palpatine had returned in a cloned body; he contacted her, demanding her allegiance. Afterwards, the resurrected Emperor, via his agents, ordered her to personally re-capture the ''Lusankya'' from a New Republic dockyard at Bilbringi.<ref name=\"EGW\" /> Fearing retribution for losing Coruscant, she vowed to re-capture the ''Lusankya'', which was being refitted for use by the New Republic,<ref name=\"NEGTC\" /> although she secretly realized that such an endeavor would most likely end up a suicide mission.<ref name=\"EGW\" />\n\n===Re-emergence===\n{{Quote|It is interesting we have not met before, you and I, having been foes for so long. I expected you to be taller.''\"<br />\"''I expected you to be dead.|Isard and Wedge Antilles finally acquaint themselves|X-Wing: Isard's Revenge}}\nWhen Thrawn returned from the Unknown Regions and launched a [[Thrawn campaign|campaign]] of his own, Isard chose not to intervene. At this point, she had realized that the Empire which she held so dearly was dead, and, rather than enter yet more battles, she simply observed as the New Republic almost collapsed. When Thrawn was defeated at the [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|Battle of Bilbringi]], Isard's clone reemerged, allying herself with Delak Krennel in the Ciutric Hegemony. The clone had spent the entire Thrawn crisis gathering up the ''Lusankya'' prisoners, and had them imprisoned on Ciutric IV. After Thrawn's death, the New Republic shifted its attention to the ever-increasing amount of former Imperial warlords, and decided to make Krennel its first target. Isard was no longer content staying out of the limelight, and hatched a plan to snatch back her beloved ''Lusankya'',<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> so that she could appease Palpatine.<ref name=\"NEC\" />\n\n[[File:IsardTotC.jpg|thumb|right|Ysanne Isard performs an intelligence operation.]]\n\nThe New Republic's first target in the Ciutric Hegemony was the planet [[Liinade III]]; Isard had a top of the line laboratory and research center built, hidden away in the mountains there. Inside the facility, she forged plans to build a superweapon similar to the Death Stars, called a [[Pulsar Station]]. As she had hoped, the New Republic found the base, and accused Krennel and Isard's clone of planning to build the superweapon. The warlord accused Head of State Mon Mothma of fabricating the entire facility, which further sowed discord and confusion among Isard's enemies. Included in the laboratory was the station's supposed construction site, [[Distna]]. The rogue clone had sprung a trap there for Rogue Squadron, and Isard needed to ensure they fell into it.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nIsard sent Vessery and his men to Distna to rescue the Rogues, who had been [[Battle of Distna|ambushed]] by swarms of TIEs, and had them brought back to the hidden base. To all outside observers, the two sides looked to have destroyed each other, and the Rogues were now believed dead by all. Back at the base, Isard met with Wedge Antilles, offering to help the New Republic take down Krennel in exchange for her freedom. In truth, Isard was looking for a way to build up her power base once again, and hoped to steal back the ''Lusankya''; she also wanted to have her clone killed. Antilles took her plea for peace as sincere, and agreed to have his squadron go in undercover and join Krennel. They would make contact with Admiral Ackbar, taking down Krennel's forces from inside, and providing him with an opportune moment to strike the Hegemony. Isard was once in again in a position of power.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nAs it was imperative that neither the New Republic nor Krennel learn that the Rogues were safe and well, Isard blocked any attempts to communication on their part, though Corran Horn attempted to defy her many a time. The Rogues began their training piloting TIE Defenders, and Vessery was impressed by their abilities. Isard confronted Corran Horn while the two worked out in the holo-gym, telling him that his attempts to get messages to his [[Mirax Terrik Horn|wife]] were futile, and that she would intercept them all. Horn goaded Isard about never having loved anyone, and she returned his jibe by mentioning her time with his father, on Darkknell.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nRogue Squadron's insertion into Ciutric went smoothly; acting as [[Requiem Squadron]] led by Colonel [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Antar Roat]], they offered to join Krennel's fleet. The warlord accepted, and Admiral Ackbar was sent information regarding his defenses and where best to strike. Isard and her TIE Defenders were supposed to assist the New Republic in their attack, though Isard had no intention of doing so. She provided Krennel with information that Ackbar was going to make a strike at the Hegemony, which meant he further defended Ciutric. She and Vessery made preparations to travel to Bilbringi&mdash;with the ''Lusankya'' on her side, and if circumstances went well, Coruscant was ripe for the taking.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nUsing the freighter [[Swift (freighter)|''Swift'']] and a set of codes procured by her spies in the New Republic, Isard [[Mission to Bilbringi|boarded]] the ''Lusankya'' at the shipyards in Bilbringi, and sent her crew up to the bridge to take control of the ship. She herself traveled to her personal command room, keeping contact with Captain [[Wintle]] as she went. His crew were unable to operate the ship from the bridge, as power had been transferred to the auxiliary bridge. They traveled there instead and Isard was just moments away from once again becoming a force to be reckoned with. It turned out, though, that Horn ''had'' managed to get a message out of the base, and had told his wife Mirax about the situation, as well as his friend [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]]. General [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]], head of New Republic Intelligence and an old foil of Isard, responded by giving his subordinate Iella as well as Mirax and her father [[Booster Terrik]] the mission of figuring out exactly what Isard's endgame in the current scenario was, with Booster ultimately figuring out that if her goal was to regain her former power, the logical immediate step would be to re-take control of the ''Lusankya'', which he had figured out the New Republic has not broken up for a mountain of spare parts as had been publicly claimed, but had been repaired to be put back into service. Hurrying to the Bilbringi shipyards using Ultra-Level clearance codes provided by NRI, the trio took command of the Star Dreadnaught before Isard arrived, transferred command to the auxiliary bridge and waited. Iella Wessiri confronted Isard in her private office at blasterpoint, telling her that she had her own people on the auxiliary bridge and that her boarding party would be sealed into an area of the ship and dealt with by manipulating the ships life support systems, taking them out of the equation. Desperate, Isard used the internal communication system to offer each of them twenty-five million Imperial credits to turn the ship over to her people, an annoyed 'Acting Captain' Booster Terrik responded to the offer by asking Iella to just shoot Isard and be done with it. Isard knew the New Republic would never try her in a court, as she knew many secrets about the government hierarchy, and goaded Wessiri, telling the woman to be done with it and kill her.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\nWessiri however had little interest in killing Isard in cold blood nor humoring her attempts at manipulation. Instead she threatened to simply imprison her on her own Super Star Destroyer, locked away in some part of the ship serviced and manned only by droids; an anonymous prisoner who would never again have contact with anyone she could manipulate for the rest of her natural life. Confronted with such a fate, the former Director of Imperial Intelligence panicked. She attempted to kill Wessiri with a holdout blaster. Wessiri was shot in the shoulder, and retaliated by shooting Isard in the stomach. As Isard lay dying, she realized that she had failed the Emperor, and resigned herself to her fate.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|I have, upon reflection, come to the conclusion that further service to you would be to condone and support an evil that would seem insignificant when grouped with the Emperor, Darth Vader, and Prince Xizor.

Jan Dodonna, Ysanne's prize prisoner, was dissuaded from ever escaping by the Director of Imperial Intelligence, who told him that should he flee, she would severely punish the Rebels aboard the ''Lusankya''.<ref name=\"Krytos Trap\" /> She also used illegal objects such as choke-collars to control allies whose loyalty she was unsure of.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" />\n\nAs well as interrogation,<ref name=\"PH\" /> Isard was skilled in a multitude of ground and intelligence skills; she was an adept slicer,<ref name=\"Darkknell\" /> blaster combatant,<ref name=\"Masquerade\" /> and unarmed combatant.<ref name=\"Retire\" /> During her escapades on Darkknell, she managed to hack into a planetary government system, and redirect an entire police unit so that they would not get in her way.<ref name=\"Darkknell\" /> Isard's talents at a computer terminal were not as great as they might have been, though, and she often had to rely on the talents of her subordinates to accomplish a task relating to slicing.<ref name=\"Mara\" /> Isard kept herself in peak physical condition at all times, even after she was no longer an active field operative.<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> To ease her anger or frustration at any given time, she went through blaster simulators,<ref name=\"Masquerade\" /> worked out in holo-gyms,<ref name=\"Isard's Revenge\" /> or practiced unarmed combat with a practice droid.<ref name=\"Retire\" /> It was a testament to her abilities that she hardly ever missed in the simulator runs.<ref name=\"Masquerade\" /> Isard was also a talented linguist, speaking [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]], [[Durese/Legends|Durese]], [[Mon Calamarian]],<ref name=\"Rebellion era sourcebook\" /> [[Geonosian (language)|Geonosian]], [[Rybese/Legends|Rybese]], and [[Twi'leki/Legends|Twi'leki]].<ref name=\"PH\" />\n\nIsard was adept at making her subordinates do what she wished. During the Emperor's time, offers of promotions were usually enough to buy one's cooperation,<ref name=\"Mara\" /> though after Endor, Isard often had to resort to offering people a position in her Empire, sometimes even as Emperor.<ref name=\"Retire\" /> She was not above using her good looks to seduce people, though this was usually driven by her own agenda.<ref name=\"Fel\" /> Isard also used personal grudges or life-long hatred between individuals as another means of motivation, hoping it would give her people more focus.<ref name=\"Wedge's Gamble\" /> Ysanne frequently had people perform extremely unsavory tasks, such as killing a family member,<ref name=\"PH\" /> executing families of traitors, or razing undefended planets which had opposed her rule, as a means of testing their loyalty and dedication to the Imperial cause.<ref name=\"Bacta War\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Ysanne_Isard_EC.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ysanne Isard]]\nYsanne Isard was created by ''[[Star Wars]]'' author [[Michael A. Stackpole]] for the [[Star Wars: X-Wing (novel series)|''X-Wing'' novels]] in [[1996]], first appearing in ''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]''. As the series progressed, Isard became a more major character, although none of the books featured scenes written from her point of view except for her final scene in Stackpole's last ''X-Wing'' novel, [[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge|''Isard's Revenge'']] in [[1999]]. After Isard seemingly died in ''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]'', she began to appear in Stackpole's [[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron|''Rogue Squadron'' comics]], set several years before the novels. In the comic series, Isard plays a more prominent role, and her thoughts are shown to readers, whereas in the books they remained largely hidden. In the final [[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement|story arc]] of the series, it is revealed that Isard had a clone; this clone, as well as the real, surviving Isard, appeared in ''Isard's Revenge''. In [[1999]] Isard appeared in a collaborative [[Interlude at Darkknell|short story]] written by Stackpole and [[Timothy Zahn]]; since then, her only appearance was a cameo in [[Paul Ens]]'s webstrip, ''[[Evasive Action: Prey]]''. Thus, virtually all of Isard's appearances have been in works by Michael A. Stackpole. In [[Aaron Allston]]'s novel ''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]'', her name is misspelled as \"Ysane Isard\".\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Ysanne Isard}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon (audiobook)|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Evasive Action: Prey]]''\n*''[[Agent of the Empire \u2013 Hard Targets 1]]''\n*''[[Interlude at Darkknell]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}\n*''[[Mara Jade \u2013 By the Emperor's Hand 1]]'' {{Flash}}\n*''[[Mara Jade \u2013 By the Emperor's Hand 2]]''\n*''[[Mara Jade \u2013 By the Emperor's Hand 3]]''\n*''[[Mara Jade \u2013 By the Emperor's Hand 4]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Tales|1|Mara Jade: A Night on the Town}} {{Mo}}\n*{{GamerCite|10|Handoff}} {{Mo}}\n*[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]] {{Flash}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: In the Empire's Service]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Masquerade]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Mandatory Retirement]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[X-Wing: Rogue Squadron (unabridged audiobook)|''X-Wing: Rogue Squadron'' unabridged audiobook]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Krytos Trap]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: The Bacta War]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]'' {{Hologram}}\n*''[[A Forest Apart]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''\n*''[[I, Jedi]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Starfighters of Adumar]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Union]]'' {{C|Appears in dream}}\n*{{GamerCite|7|Red Sky, Blue Flame}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Backlash'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*''[[Star Wars Gamemaster Screen, Revised]]''\n*''[[Cracken's Threat Dossier]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|12|The Women Of Star Wars}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 1: X-Wing Rogue Squadron]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*{{CollectorCite|4|Rogue Leaders}}\n*{{CollectorCite|5|Around the Galaxy}}\n*{{InQuestCite|50|Star Wars Episode VII: Rise of the New Republic}}\n*''[[Star Wars Handbook 2: Crimson Empire]]''\n*{{CollectorCite|8|ComicScan|ComicScan: 'Til Death Do They Part}}\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']]\n*{{GamerCite|5|The Emperor's Pawns}}\n*{{FFCite|111|BRI2, ''Shira Brie''}}\n*''[[Rebellion Era Sourcebook]]''\n*''[[Alien Anthology]]''\n*{{FFCite|9|COR7&ndash;8, ''Coruscant &ndash;
