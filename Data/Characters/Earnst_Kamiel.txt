This led him to establish the [[Justice Action Network]] (JAN), with the parents of [[Jan Ors]].\n\n==Biography==\nThe JAN organization was an anti-[[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] terrorist group, and took an extremist approach to resisting the Empire. It rose to prominence on the planet [[Findris]], around [[13 BBY/Legends|13 BBY]], and rapidly spread through the [[Colonies/Legends|Colonies Region]].\n\nKamiel was wanted by the Empire for thousands of bombings, and the deaths of up to 10,000 individuals. He was given the death sentence in 54 systems. Kamiel was eventually captured by the Empire in the [[Elrood sector/Legends|Elrood sector]] following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], and transferred to [[Haldeen]] where he was executed shortly afterwards by a firing squad.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|6|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1stm}}\n*{{Journal|8|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{Mo}}\n*{{Journal|10|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|Under ''Findris''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050407b|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 2|int=The Dark Forces Saga|archivedate=20100130004449}}\n*{{SW|url=news/viva-space-vegas-the-history-of-the-marvelous-wheel-part-1|text=Viva Space Vegas!
