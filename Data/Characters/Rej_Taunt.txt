As the eldest son of a family of [[Tomuon]] cloth traders, he was inherently wealthy. Rej was a previous owner of the rebuilt [[YT-1300 light freighter/Legends|YT-1300 light freighter]] that came to be known as the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']]; under his command, the YT-1300 was known as the ''Second Chance''.\n\nWhile Taunt was on a job from a [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] [[Vigo/Legends|Vigo]] to pick up an order of [[Pistoeka sabotage droid/Legends|buzz droids]], the unsecured droids managed to activate and start dismantling the ''Second Chance'' from the inside out. The buzz droids were successfully jettisoned from the ship. However, an [[Acclamator-class assault ship|''Acclamator''-class assault ship]] accompanied by a [[Destroyer/Legends|Destroyer]] approached the YT-1300 to do a search. The Imperial Acclamator flew through the swarm of buzz droids, which then dismantled the ship.\n\nA little more than 60 years later, Rej was visited by [[Tobb Jadak]] and [[Flitcher Poste]] while incarcerated on [[Carcel]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|''Millennium Falcon'']] {{1st|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook}}\n*[[Millennium Falcon (audiobook)|''Millennium Falcon'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30ec\u30b8\u30fb\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30c8\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taunt, Rej}}\n[[Category:Askajians]]\n[[Category:Crime lords]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
