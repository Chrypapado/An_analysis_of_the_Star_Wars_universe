He was a coworker of [[Feltipern Trevagg/Legends|Feltipern Trevagg]].\n\n==Biography==\nTrevagg caught sight of [[M'iiyoom Onith/Legends|M'iiyoom Onith]], a female [[H'nemthe (species)/Legends|H'nemthe]]. Balu warned Feltipern to {{Audio|LeaveTheGirlAlone.ogg|\"leave the girl alone\"}} when he was attempting to bed her. However, stubborn Trevagg didn't listen to him, and was killed during their mating ritual. Balu's surprised reaction to [[Wuher/Legends|Wuher's]] fingering of [[M'iiyoom Onith/Legends|M'iiyoom Onith]] in Trevagg's murder suggests that Balu did not know of the danger Trevagg was in.\n\nAs a security officer, Balu patrolled the streets of Mos Eisley. He wore dark blue pants and vest, gray shirt, and tan holster and belt.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIn the audio dramatization of ''[[Nightlily: The Lovers' Tale]]'', the character was voiced by [[Russell Horton]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Nightlily: The Lovers' Tale]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Mos Eisley Adventure Set|story=Vested Interest}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Mos Eisley Adventure Set|story=Harvest Day (adventure)|stext=Harvest Day}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Mos Eisley Adventure Set|story=The Passage From Perdition}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=Mos Eisley Adventure Set|story=A Line in the Sand...}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Mos Eisley Adventure Set]]''\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Balu, Predne}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army personnel of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
