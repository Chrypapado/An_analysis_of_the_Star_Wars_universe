''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the formation of the Empire to [[19 BBY]], therefore Han Solo must have been expelled in [[10 BBY]]. Nettic Whain served as [[Captain]] at the [[Carida Academy]] one week prior to Solo's expulsion, meaning [[Gender|he]] must have achieved that [[Military rank|rank]] by [[10 BBY]]</ref> he had achieved the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[captain]] at the [[Carida Academy]], where he served as [[commanding officer]] to [[Sergeant]] [[Triosa Broog]]. Whain questioned Broog, the commanding officer to [[Han Solo]], on why the disobedient [[cadet]] had not been expelled from the [[Imperial Academy|academy]] after repeated demerits and incidents of insubordination. She pointed to Solo's exemplary flight record, explaining that she had never seen anyone with his reaction time or innovative problem-solving skills when [[pilot]]ing a [[Starship|ship]]. Whain countered that he would rather have one hundred recruits who follow orders than the best pilot in [[the galaxy]] who does not. She implored the captain to give Solo one more chance, declaring she believed she could get him to follow orders. After realizing just how impressive Solo's flight skills were, Whain relented, on the condition that she take away his flight privileges for a week&mdash;if Solo improved he could be reinstated and if he did not, he would be expelled and sent [[Mimban|somewhere]] a [[soldier]] who could not follow orders could be useful.<ref name=\"Expanded\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition (audiobook)|''Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ja=\u30cd\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30a8\u30a4\u30f3\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Whain, Nettic}}\n[[Category:Carida residents]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy captains of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
