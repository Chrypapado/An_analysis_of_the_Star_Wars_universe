Have you seen him? I suppose you haven't unless you've visited the pirate hideout. Oh? You haven't heard? My master was kidnapped. Will you rescue him?|Demitri Firewatcher, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n'''Demitri Firewatcher''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Firewatcher's master was kidnapped by [[Naboo pirates|pirates]] and brought to their [[Pirate Bunker|bunker]] in the [[Gallo Mountains/Legends|Gallo Mountains]]. Firewatcher stayed in [[Keren/Legends|Keren]], hoping to find help for his master until he finally met a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] who was willing to venture to the pirate's hideout and attempt a rescue operation. Demitri told him of treasures that were rumored to be found at this location. He then gave the spacer the approximate coordinates of the pirate bunker and waited for the spacer's return.<ref name=\"SWG:DF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDemitri Firewatcher is a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. He is a so-called \"Herald NPC\", which were added to the game to point players to dungeons and other points of interest.<ref name=\"SWG:DF\" />\n\nFirewatcher is not part of a quest. When talking to Firewatcher, the player can decide whether to help him or decline his plea. If the player agrees to go to the pirate bunker, only a new waypoint is added to the player's datapad and it's up to the player if he wants to explore this location. None of the prisoners in the bunker can be identified as Firewatcher's master. If the player frees the prisoners by talking to them after killing the pirates, Firewatcher's dialogue doesn't change.<ref name=\"SWG:DF\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Demitri Firewatcher}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Firewatcher, Demitri}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]"}}}]}}}}
