In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Gel contacted the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] and asked them to send [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] to Dalicron-4, as he felt that Caeleb was at risk from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], because he was strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. The Alliance sent a team of its agents instead, and Jhara traveled to the village of [[Dalia (township)|Dalia]] to meet them. She acquired some [[Cracian Thumper]]s from the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Meebo]], and they rode them back to her family's farm. However, upon arrival they found that Gel was dead and Caeleb missing, so they set out to find the missing child.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Child of Light]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Soulsaber (adventure)|''Soulsaber'']] {{Mo}}\n*[[Light and Dark (adventure)|''Light and Dark'']] {{Mo}}\n\n[[Category:Dalicron-4 residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
