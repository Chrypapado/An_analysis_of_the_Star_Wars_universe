His favorite \"pet\" was a fully-grown [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]]. He presented the appearance of an earnest businessman.\n\nThe Emporium was actually a cover for Squid's secret, second career as a criminal. When [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] took over criminal operations within the [[Cularin system]], Squin moved [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] for him using animal containers. When [[Nirama]] took over and ended slavery in that [[Star system/Legends|star system]], Squin was able to hide his old connections. He also worked as a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], picking up goods from the [[Cularin system asteroid belt|asteroid belt's]] [[Pirate/Legends|pirates]] to be sold while on runs to get supplies for his many animals. He also wasn't above murder, as some of his competitors disappeared at times when his food budget was not as high as it should have been.\n\nHlisk Squin was bald with a red beard and had a drooping build. Bland of features, he was the type of person who could work in with the background without being noticed.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Squin, Hlisk}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Smugglers]]"}}}]}}}}
