Involvement in such a 'profession' was, of course, unusual for a Wookiee.\n\nIn [[29 BBY/Legends|29 BBY]], Rashtah accompanied Krayn to [[Rorak 5]] for a business meeting with the [[Colicoid/Legends|Colicoids]], who sought total control over the spice operations on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]]. Krayn directed Rashtah to monitor the movements of the slave trader \"[[Bakleeda]],\" an advisor to the Colicoids who was tasked with inspecting the crime lord's factories on the \"Smuggler's Moon.\"\n\nAfter an intense struggle, Rashtah was [[Death/Legends|killed]] in a [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]] within the slave factories of [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] by \"Bakleeda\" ([[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in disguise), whom the Wookiee had attacked at the behest of Krayn.\n\nRashtah had a scar that ran from his head to his lip; a battle-damaged eye was covered by an eyepatch.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nAlthough ''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]'' depicts Rashtah with a scar running through his [[Eye/Legends|eye]] and wearing an [[eye patch]], in the [[Star Wars: Jedi Quest (comic series)|''Jedi Quest'' comic]] series he is depicted with both eyes intact. Some images in the comics, however, do show his facial scar.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Quest: Path to Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: Jedi Quest (comic series)|''Jedi Quest'' comic]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FFCite|55|KRA2, ''Krayn''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Rashtah\n|es=Rashtah\n|hu=Rashtah\n|nl=Rashtah\n|ru=\u0420\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Wookiees]]"}}}]}}}}
