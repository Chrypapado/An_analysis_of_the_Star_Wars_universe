The protective mother of [[Dooni]], she was the leader of her [[Foonar]] herd. She was once enslaved by a species of [[Unidentified alien woodsmen|green-skinned harvesters]] from another world. She was later freed from her shackles by [[Wicket Wystri Warrick/Legends|Wicket Wystri Warrick]], [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka]], and her own Dooni. She then helped the [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] turn the slavers' own [[harvester]] machine against them, driving them away from the forest moon.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Ewoks 5|''Ewoks'' 5]] {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Doonis Mutter\n}}\n\n[[Category:Endorians]]"}}}]}}}}
