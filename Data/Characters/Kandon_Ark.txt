During the [[Bek&ndash;Vulkar gang war]], he ran the [[Swoop/Legends|swoop bike]] garage within the [[Black Vulkar Base]].\n\n==Biography==\nArk was one of [[Brejik]]'s chief [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenants]] and was in charge of the [[Black Vulkars/Legends|Black Vulkars]] garage, where he was tasked with guarding the [[prototype accelerator]] stolen from the [[Hidden Beks]]. As one of the most important Vulkars in the [[Swoop gang/Legends|swoop gang]], Ark had many assistants and a [[Kandon's bodyguard|bodyguard]]. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], who had been hired by the Hidden Beks to recover the [[Prototype accelerator|accelerator]], was forced to [[Death/Legends|kill]] Ark after turning down Ark's offer to kill [[Gadon Thek]] in exchange for [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Bastila Shan]]. After that, he collected the accelerator, and brought it to the Beks.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the player follows the dark-side option in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', Revan does not kill Ark, but instead accepts his proposal of joining the Black Vulkars' garage and killing Gadon Thek, the leader of the Hidden Beks. Then Ark promotes Revan as a swoop rider for the Vulkars. If the player returns to the Black Vulkar Base, he will not be present, but his bodyguard and the other members of the gang will be there and attack the player for killing Brejik.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{ID|Kandon}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kandon Ark\n|nl=Kandon Ark\n|pl=Kandon Ark\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043d \u0410\u0440\u043a\n|fi=Kandon Ark\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ark, Kandon}}\n[[Category:Black Vulkars]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
