You are indispensible&mdash;you alone have rallied your people against the yoke of the Republic. You cannot be replaced.|Count Dooku|Jedi: Shaak Ti}}\n'''Shogar Tok''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] clan leader and [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]] allied with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].\n\n==Biography==\nShogar Tok  was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Brentaal IV/Legends|Brentaal IV]]. As a clan leader, he captured a prison facility on Brentaal IV during the early stages of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], converting it into his base of operations. He rallied his people against the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], and established a military presence on the planet. This drew the attention of the Republic, and a task force was dispatched to retake Brentaal IV. [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]], [[Agen Kolar/Legends|Agen Kolar]], and [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]] led their troops against Tok's forces, though [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] ordered Tok himself to remain away from the frontlines, secure within his fortress.\n\n[[File:TheDeathofShogarTok.jpg|thumb|left|The death of Shogar Tok at the hands of [[Shaak Ti/Legends|Shaak Ti]].]]\n\nHowever, in time, even Shogar Tok's headquarters were penetrated by the enemy. Shaak Ti confronted Tok in his command center, forcing the [[Zeltron/Legends|Zeltron]] murderer [[Lyshaa]] to seduce Tok and cloud his emotions. Though Lyshaa accomplished this, she betrayed Shaak Ti, shooting her in the stomach before the Jedi could order Tok to surrender. Lyshaa informed Shogar of Shaak Ti's intentions, gaining Tok's gratitude. However, Shaak Ti recovered from her wound, and engaged Tok in a fierce duel, with Ti using her [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and Tok his [[Vibro-ax/Legends|vibro-ax]], which was presumable made of one of the few lightsaber resistant metals.\n\nDespite her weakened condition, Shaak managed to best Shogar Tok, stabbing him through the gut with her lightsaber. Tok's fortress defenses were destroyed, and his leaderless troops were forced to surrender.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nShogar's name is once misspelled as \"Hogar.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi: Shaak Ti]]'' {{1st}}\n*{{InsiderCite|70|CIS Shadowfeed Dispatch 14:9:15 Edition}} {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]''\n*{{DB|character|shaakti|Ti, Shaak|archivedate=20110913140824}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Shogar Tok\n|pl=Shogar Tok\n|ru=\u0428\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0440 \u0422\u043e\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tok, Shogar}}\n[[Category:Brentaalans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Separatist officers]]\n[[Category:Warlords]]"}}}]}}}}
