During that [[Standard year/Legends|year]], when the [[Prince/Legends|princess]] of [[Hapes/Legends|Hapes]], [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]], was attending [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] [[Jedi Praxeum]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], Ta'a Chume, who was Tenel Ka's grandmother, ordered Yfra to observe Tenel Ka in her place of study. Tenel Ka disliked the idea of Yfra visiting her while she was at the Praxeum not only because she had a low opinion of the denizens of her grandmother's court, but also because she did not want her status as the heir to the [[Throne/Legends|throne]] of the [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]] to be made public. Skywalker realized this and tried to help the young princess keep Yfra from coming to the [[Jedi academy]]. When Tenel Ka's friends [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi trainees]] [[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] were kidnapped and taken to the [[Shadow Academy]], the secret training center of the [[Second Imperium]], Tenel Ka went with Skywalker to rescue them and in the process escaped being being visited by Yfra.<ref name=\"Shadow\">''[[Young Jedi Knights: Shadow Academy]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing a disastrous [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] exercise with Jacen which left Tenel Ka's left [[Limb/Legends|arm]] severed, Yfra brought the young heir to Hapes. It was then that Yfra attempted to assassinate Ta'a Chume along with Tenel Ka and her [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] classmates while they were residing at [[Reef Fortress]]. Yfra arranged for their [[Hapan Water Dragon|wavespeeder]] to be sabotaged, a patch of [[carnivorous seaweed]] to ambush them, and for a squad of deadly [[Bartokk]] mercenaries to attack them.<ref name=\"Lightsabers\" />\n\nTenel Ka and her companions succeeded in foiling Yfra's plot with their budding Jedi skills. In the end, Yfra was arrested.<ref name=\"Lightsabers\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nYfra first appeared in ''[[Young Jedi Knights: Shadow Academy]]'', a [[1995]] young readers novel by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and [[Rebecca Moesta]], and again appeared in the [[1996]] ''[[Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers]]'' of the same [[Star Wars: Young Jedi Knights|series]] and by the same authors.
