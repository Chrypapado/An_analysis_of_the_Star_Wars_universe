During the [[Great Sith War/Legends|Great Sith War]], Uln was a [[Sith Acolyte|Sith acolyte]] under the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]]. Sometime after [[Sith Empire (Great Sith War)|Kun's Sith Empire]] was defeated by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], Uln became the headmaster of Korriban's [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] Academy, eventually taking the [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]] [[Uthar Wynn]] as his [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]]. In [[3959 BBY]], when the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] and [[Darth Malak]] initiated the [[Jedi Civil War]], Uln swore allegiance to their [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]] and [[Sith training|trained]] many of Revan and Malak's [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]].\n\nEventually, Uln grew mentally unstable and was driven out of the Academy by Wynn, who usurped his position as the Academy's headmaster. Uln took up residence in the [[Tomb of Tulak Hord|tomb]] of the ancient Sith [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Tulak Hord]], located in the [[Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends|Valley of the Dark Lords]]. In the Jedi Civil War's [[3956 BBY|final year]], Uln encountered Revan&mdash;now a [[Jedi training/Legends|retrained]] [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]]&mdash;during the Jedi's quest to find the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Star Forge]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]], which was under the control of the reigning Dark Lord, Darth Malak. The Sith Master trapped Revan and his companions inside Tulak Hord's tomb, and tested the Jedi's knowledge of the Sith ways while [[Torture/Legends|torturing]] him and the Sith student [[Mekel]]. When Uln's test concluded, Revan and his companions joined forces with Mekel and [[Death/Legends|slew]] the Sith Master.\n\n==Biography==\n===Headmaster of the Sith Academy===\n{{Quote|My name is Jorak Uln.

Revan was searching for the [[Rakata/Legends|Rakatan]] [[Star Forge]], a [[Space station/Legends|space station]] under the control of his former apprentice and the ruling Dark Lord, Darth Malak. When Revan, who had heard of Uln's reputation, and his companions attempted to make their way to Hord's sarcophagus, they were incapacitated by a trap set by Uln. The former headmaster then took Revan to the room where Hord's sarcophagus was.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nAfter Revan awoke, Uln introduced himself to the Jedi and forced him to participate in a test of knowledge of the Sith ways. Uln told Revan that if he answered several questions concerning Sith morality correctly, Uln would torture the Sith student [[Mekel]], who was also in the tomb, with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]]. Uln also informed Revan that incorrect answers and refusals to answer would result in the Jedi himself being tortured. When the game began, Revan answered Uln's four questions incorrectly in order to spare Mekel's life. Much to Uln's surprise, Revan survived the test. The Sith Master told Mekel that he was free to leave the tomb while he figured out what to do with Revan, but Mekel instead assaulted Uln with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Angered by this, Uln attacked both Mekel and Revan, but the Jedi and his allies, along with Mekel, combined forces and [[Death/Legends|killed]] the former headmaster. After Uln's death, Revan was able to convince Mekel to abandon the Sith ways. Revan later presented Wynn with [[Jorak Uln's Sith tablet|Uln's ancient Sith tablet]], which contained recordings of Tulak Hord's teachings.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Let's see&hellip;ah, yes.

His skin was a sickly pale and his [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] were [[Color/Legends|white]]. By the time he met Revan, Uln was bald, and only had [[Hair/Legends|hair]] on the back of his head. Uln possessed strong beliefs in the principles and teachings of the Sith. During his time in Hord's tomb, he studied the ancient ruins inside to find theories on the ancient Sith's philosophies. He believed that the students that his successor, Uthar Wynn, had been training lacked the \"gumption\" and purity he expected from a true Sith. Because of this, he captured students from the Sith Academy and played torture games with them, in the hopes of finding students who exhibited traits of the old Sith. These games involved questioning the students and torturing them if they failed to answer the question correctly. He was sadistic in his teaching and activism for the Sith cause. Although Uln believed that he would still be remembered for being the Academy's former headmaster, he did not expect the Sith to consider him an \"old hermit,\" which he believed to be slander. Uln held Wynn in low regard and went out of his way to ridicule Wynn's teachings.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\nUln was capable of setting traps in order to capture students for his torture sessions. In addition, Uln possessed abilities which allowed him to fend off the [[Tuk'ata/Legends|tuk'ata]] and [[Shyrack/Legends|shyrack]] creatures that also resided in Hord's tomb.\n\n==Equipment==\nUln owned an ancient Sith tablet that he successfully translated; the tablet also contained his opinions of Tulak Hord's teachings. Uln possessed a [[Double-bladed lightsaber/Legends|double-bladed lightsaber]] containing a [[Color/Legends|red]] [[Lightsaber crystal|crystal]], and also kept an [[Opila]] lightsaber [[Crystal/Legends|crystal]].<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a Sith Master, Uln had a strong command of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. He was capable of using Force lightning, often employing this both against his enemies and on the Academy's students that he captured. Uln also used the Force to [[Telekinesis/Legends|choke]] his foes and [[Force drain/Legends|drain]] their life forces, replenishing his own vitality. During [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|combat]], Uln wielded a double-bladed lightsaber.<ref name=\"KotOR game\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJorak Uln was created as a villain<ref name=\"KotOR game\" /> for the [[2003]] [[Xbox]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', developed by [[BioWare]].<ref name=\"Game\">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/pc-16512|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic|archivedate=20161027055618}}</ref> Uln was mentioned in the ''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]'',<ref name=\"KotOR CG\" /> and received an entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.<ref name=\"CSWE: Uln, Jorak\" />\n\nAlthough there are multiple choices that the player can make in-game with Uln,<ref name=\"KotOR SG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''</ref> the [[canon]]ical choices are the options that increase Revan's alignment with the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]].<ref name=\"CSWE: Uln, Jorak\" /> If the player follows the dark side, he or she can allow Mekel to die by answering three of Uln's questions correctly.
