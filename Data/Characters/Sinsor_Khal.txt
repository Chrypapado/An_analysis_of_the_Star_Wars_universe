For reasons unknown, he was considered a failure as a Jedi, and as such was overlooked during the [[Great Jedi Purge/Legends|Great Jedi Purge]]. Shortly before the Purge, he returned home to the [[Hapes Consortium/Legends|Hapes Consortium]] and eventually became a respected [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]], but his disregard for the well-being of his subjects resulted in a semi-imprisonment on [[Gallinore]] by [[Ta'a Chume]].\n\nIn an effort to isolate [[Yuuzhan Vong]] communication technology and use it to her advantage, [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] sought out Khal during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. To achieve results, a captured [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] named [[Crimpler]], who had a [[Yorik-Kul|coral implant]] in his neck, was \"experimented\" on into a near-[[Death/Legends|death]] state. After two days, Khal got the desired results, and gave them to Jaina to use.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]''\n*{{GamerCite|8|The Apprentice (short story)|The Apprentice}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Sinsor Khal\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khal, Sinsor}}\n[[Category:Hapans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
