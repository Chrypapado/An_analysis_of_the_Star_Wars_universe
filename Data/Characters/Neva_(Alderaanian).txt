In [[3643 BBY]] she was seduced by the gangster [[Skavak/Legends|Skavak]] as part of his scheme and was convinced to fake the genetic test results, identifying the head Skavak brought to Ahuff as belonging to [[Darth Bandon]]. After Skavak bartered the head for an [[Arkanian/Legends|Arkanian]] [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]], he convinced Neva to run away with him, but duped her shortly afterwards.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Clerical workers and assistants]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
