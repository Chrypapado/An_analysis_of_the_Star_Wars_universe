His main home was a spire on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Scourge.jpg|thumb|left|Mander Zuma enters the chambers of Popara Anjiliac Diresto.]]\nMost of his capital came from legitimate business practices. He was not very trusting of others, yet he could be counted on as one of the most trustworthy of the Hutts. He believed that legitimate businesses could bring in more wealth than any criminal activities. He had two offspring, [[Mika Anjiliac Chiera]] and [[Zonnos Anjiliac Priare]]. He later adopted [[Vago Gejalli Thokka]], a Hutt of the [[Gejalli]] clan, when the Huttlet's blood clan was killed.\n\nPopara owned three female [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Slavery/Legends|slaves]] who were [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]]. They told him the intentions of anyone who did business with him.\n\nPopara's [[Ubrikkian Industries/Legends|Ubrikkian]] [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] was the ''[[Imru Ootmian]]''. He was also the owner of [[Skydove Freight]].\n\nHe was killed by his younger offspring, Mika, who blamed the murder on Zonnos.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBecause the adventure ''Tempest Feud'' is not given a specific era, and the scenario supports campaigns taking place in the [[Rise of the Empire era]], [[Rebellion era]], [[New Republic era]], or [[New Jedi Order era]], Popara could have been living at any point between [[100 BBY/Legends|100 BBY]] and [[40 ABY]], though the adventure as written cannot take place between [[26 ABY]] to [[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]], since it involves Nar Shaddaa. At the time of the scenario, he is \"centuries\" old, and owns a yacht built in the Rise of the Empire period. At one point, Popara hosts two Twi'lek envoys from [[Nirama]], the [[Cularin system]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]]. Nirama, thus far, is only known to have operated before the rise of the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tempest Feud]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Scourge (novel)|''Scourge'']]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20020328dtfgallery|text=Larger Than Life and Twice As Ugly|int=Larger Than Life and Twice As Ugly|archivedate=20090926191431}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=starwars/article.asp?x=sw20020221cgrubb&c=rpg|text=Hutts Are Fun!|int=Hutts Are Fun!|archivedate=20100305183431}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{C|\"Zonnos the Lesser,\" \"H-3PO\" entries}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*''[[Lords of Nal Hutta]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Popara Anjiliac Diresto\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anjiliac Diresto, Popara}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Hutts of the Anjiliac clan]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
