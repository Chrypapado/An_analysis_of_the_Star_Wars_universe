At the same time, the [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] of the [[Naboo (people)|Naboo people]], [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], had reached the end of her term and was succeeded by the [[opera]] [[Musician|singer]] and former [[queen]] [[R\u00e9illata]], who requested that Amidala take Oshadam's place. Following her admission to the Senate, Amidala recognized that Oshadam was a polite individual but one eager to resign, and speculated that her predecessor had grown weary of the Senate's tedious and indecisive proceedings.<ref name=\"Queen's Shadow\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOshadam was first mentioned in the [[2019]] novel ''[[Queen's Shadow]]'', written by [[E.
