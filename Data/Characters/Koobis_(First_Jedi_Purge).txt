When [[Meetra Surik]] received a mission from [[Luxa]] to speak with [[Loppak Slusk]], he let the former Jedi [[Skirmishes on Citadel Station|enter]]. The [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] then promptly deserted the area.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Jedi Exile, as the playable character in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', has the possibility to kill Koobis for not letting him/her into the Exchange headquarters. However, this is a Dark Side option and does not help the Exile getting in.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Koobis\n}}\n\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Rodians]]\n[[Category:Telosians]]"}}}]}}}}
