She was a fashionable [[Gender/Legends|woman]] and made many cultural contributions to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. [[Bestine (city)/Legends|Bestine]], the only habitation on Tatooine with a [[Museum/Legends|museum]], was where she imported all of her expensive entertainment goods. She mostly stayed in the Bestine Settlement, avoiding [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]], which she despised. She compared the residents of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] to beings of lower class like barbarians and [[Farmer/Legends|farmers]].
