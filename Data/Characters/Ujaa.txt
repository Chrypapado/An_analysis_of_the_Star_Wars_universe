Ujaa's recruitment was promptly accompanied by that of his brother, [[Ujii]], establishing the first incarnation of the Twisted Rancor Trio. Friction developed between Elinda and Ujaa as the former found his skills as a musician to be mediocre. When Elinda threatened to quit due to Ujaa's lack of talent, Gilthos fired Ujaa and replaced him with another Bith named [[Loopa]], upsetting Ujii who very soon left the band.\n\nUksaris would later draft a chronicle of the band titled ''[[Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio]]'' which detailed Ujaa's role in the formation of the band and his subsequent dismissal.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nUjaa, like the other members of the Twisted Rancor Trio, only appear as holograms in the video game ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' if the player, as [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] finds a package delivered to Gilthos Uksaris in an [[Lower City Apartments|apartment]] in the [[Lower City]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. The package, in the form of a security crate, is booby-trapped by a [[Holo-Sec Corp]] [[Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive|anti-theft explosive]] such that for the crate to be opened, the six [[Holoprojector/Legends|holoprojectors]] of the band's members must be activated in order of their recruitment. The player can find the correct order by reading Uksaris's chronicle within a datapad on the desk nearby.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ujaa\n|pl=Ujaa\n|ru=\u042e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0430\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bith]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Twisted Rancor Trio Band Members]]"}}}]}}}}
