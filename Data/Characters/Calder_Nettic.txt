Nettic was [[Death/Legends|murdered]] in [[3956 BBY]] by a [[Colonist/Legends|colonist]] named [[Handon Guld]] after Nettic had an [[Reproduction/Legends|affair]] with his [[Handon Guld's wife|wife]]. An investigation into his death was carried out by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Bolook]] and [[Revan/Legends|Revan]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Dantooine2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nettic lived on Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War.]]\nCalder Nettic was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Colonist/Legends|colonist]] who lived on the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Farm/Legends|farming]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] with his [[Calder Nettic's wife|wife]] during the [[Time/Legends|time]] of the [[Jedi Civil War]]. He ran a surface-to-[[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] transportation service with his business partner, another colonist by the name of [[Rickard Lusoff]]. Following a business deal in [[3956 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\" /> Nettic was accused by Lusoff of cheating him out of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. On one occasion, the two were at a [[Garang spaceport cantina|cantina]] attached to the [[Garang Spaceport|spaceport]] located in [[Garang]], the planet's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]]. After consuming [[Alcohol/Legends|drinks]] there, the two got into a drunken altercation, noticed by the municipal authorities. The [[Jedi Enclave]] on the planet was notified, and a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] named [[Tooka (Jedi)|Tooka]] was dispatched to break up the fight. Concurrently, Nettic had been engaging in an affair with the [[Handon Guld's wife|wife]] of a man named [[Handon Guld]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Handon_guld.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Handon Guld, Nettic's murderer]]\nNettic and Guld repeatedly rented a [[Speeder/Legends|speeder]] together, and following their time together, Guld discovered the affair Nettic had with his [[Marriage/Legends|wife]]. Enraged, he plotted to [[Death/Legends|murder]] Nettic. At the same time, Lusoff planned to kill Nettic, feeling cheated out of [[Currency/Legends|money]]. Several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] after the [[Destruction of Taris|destruction]] of the Outer Rim [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|ecumenopolis]] world of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] at the hands of the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire]],<ref name= \"Murder date\">According to ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]],'' Calder Nettic was [[Death/Legends|murdered]] a few [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] before [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] was sent on his third trial. ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' places the events of the game in [[3956 BBY]], and the game had previously established that Revan had been [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] for several [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]]. This means that Nettic was murdered in 3956 BBY, several weeks after the [[Destruction of Taris|destruction]] of [[Taris/Legends|Taris]].</ref>  Nettic was out in an [[Ancient Grove]] near the Jedi Enclave during a cloudy morning. Guld intercepted him, and shot him in the back with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. However, at the same time, Lusoff was also planning to kill Nettic. Seeing Guld standing there, Lusoff took the shot with his [[hunting rifle]], shooting Guld in the side of his abdomen. When he ran out of the brush, Lusoff injured his [[Limb/Legends|leg]], while Guld dropped his blaster and called the authorities, beleiving he was about to be killed. <ref name=\"kotor\" />\n===The Investigation===\nA [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] named [[Bolook]] was assigned to the scene, and filled the role of an [[Jedi investigator/Legends|investigator]]. Bolook brought with him an [[Analysis droid/Legends|information droid]], which was able to access the [[Jedi Archives/Legends|archives]] in the Jedi Enclave, and well as the Capital of Garang. They sent the dropped blaster and a sample of [[Blood/Legends|blood]] found on the scene to the Enclave for analysis.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Gamemechanics|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n[[File:InvestigationDantooine.png|thumb|left|225px|The two suspects are held at the crime scene while Bolook, Revan, and an Information droid investigate.]]\nA few [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] later, an [[Amnesia/Legends|amnesiac]] [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] was sent on his third and final [[Jedi Initiate Trials|initiate trial]] by [[Zhar Lestin]] of the [[Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council|council]]. Revan was to cleanse a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark]] taint, the fallen [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Juhani]], from the Ancient Grove. When he passed through the crime scene, he was stopped by Bolook, who requested his assistance. Bolook saw the investigation as a way for Revan to further his training, wanting him to solve the crime on his own. After examining Guld and Lusoff's stories, Revan began to pick out inconsistencies. When the blood and blaster were confirmed not to have been Nettic's, Revan was able to deduce the true story, and presented his conclusion to Bolook. Bolook was surprised at the boldness of the claim, but took the two men into custody, and escorted them to the Enclave's holding facilities. Rickard Lusoff was charged with agravated assault and attempted murder, while Handon Guld was formally charged with Nettic's murder. Following the investigation, Nettic's body was removed from the grove.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCalder Nettic appeared as a corpse in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]],'' developed by [[BioWare]]. If the player passes through a certain area, the interaction with Bolook, and subsequently the investigation, is unavoidable. However, they have the option to refuse to help Bolook, insulting him in the process. They may also quit the investigation at any point, or come to an incorrect final conclusion. Upon the end of the investigation, Nettic's body disappears.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}} {{Corpse}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Calder Nettic\n|pl=Calder Nettic\n|ru=\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u041d\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nettic, Calder}}\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
