He carried out research for the company from a lab that was located in his house, on the edge of the city of [[Hedrett]]. He also employed the [[Tarasin]] [[Ta'Mara]] as a cleaner.\n\nIn about [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], Amir began studying a plant that was reputed to have medicinal properties. After examining it in his personal laboratory, he wanted to study the sample using specialist equipment in the [[Culpharm Central Laboratory]], so he called [[Culpharm Security]] and arranged for the sample to be transported there. A [[Human/Legends|Human]] and [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] dressed in Culpharm Security uniforms turned up at his house and collected the sample. However, they were in fact employees of [[Biotherapy]], a rival company of Culpharm, who hoped to discover what Amir had been developing. Two genuine Culpharm Security guards, [[Blut]] and [[Mien]], turned up a short time later and Amir informed them that the samples had already been collected.\n\nCulpharm hired the [[Heroes of Cularin]] to investigate the disappearance of the samples. They traveled to Amir's house and asked him some questions about the circumstances surrounding their disappearance.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mix and Match]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amir, Waz-alem}}\n[[Category:Cereans]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Culpharm members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"}}}]}}}}
