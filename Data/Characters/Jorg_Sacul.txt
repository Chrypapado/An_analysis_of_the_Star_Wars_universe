After a near-fatal crash in his [[T-16 skyhopper/Legends|T-16 skyhopper]], he found a new direction in life, and entered the [[Imperial Academy/Legends|Imperial Academy]] (though it is not known at which Academy he studied). He graduated as the top [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] in his class.\n\nAfter joining the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]], his natural leadership abilities made him an excellent flight instructor, and eventually earned him the rank of [[Commander/Legends|commander]]. He was renowned for both his calm under fire and his mentorship of younger [[Rebel pilot/Legends|pilots]]. He also had great reserves of inner strength<ref name=\"TCSWE\" />&mdash;in fact, he was rumored to have been [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]]. Many commented that in another era, he would have made a great [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]].\n\nSacul was also a visionary storyteller. He entertained the pilots in his command by telling stories set long ago, in far off galaxies.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Jorg_sacul.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Jorg Sacul action figure, in packaging.]]\n\nJorg Sacul was released as a limited-edition action figure first made available at the \"[[Celebration II|Star Wars: Celebration II]]\" convention in [[May (month)|May]] [[2002]]. The figure was also distributed in limited numbers in various European promotions.\n\nThe head of the Jorg Sacul action figure is attached to the same X-Wing pilot body used for the \"Power of the Force 2\" version of the [[Biggs Darklighter/Legends|Biggs Darklighter]] action figure. The figure also came with a removable helmet, [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]], miniature X-Wing (a Micro Machines version), and cardboard scene depicting the [[Great Temple/Legends|Rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]].\n\nFan relations coordinator [[Stephen J. Sansweet]] had a role in writing the bio for the action figure card.\n\nThe name \"Jorg Sacul\" is a [[tuckerization]] of \"[[George Lucas]].\" The action figure is a likeness of ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator George Lucas, and was created to honor him as part of the celebrations for the 25th anniversary of ''Star Wars''. Jorg's near-fatal crash and his visionary storytelling are references to George Lucas's real biography.\n\n==Sources==\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars Saga|pack=Commander Jorg Sacul (Rebel Pilot)|altlink=https://www.rebelscum.com/sagac2sacul.asp|archivedate=20190809152359}} {{1stm}}\n*{{InsiderCite|61|Scouting the Galaxy}}\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night}}\n*{{InsiderCite|81|Scouting the Galaxy}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|121|Prequels in Plastic and Other Toy Tales}}\n*{{Topps|set=2011 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 6}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/6008/4207 Cargo Bay listing] for Jorg Sacul at [[StarWars.com]].\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jorg Sacul\n|ja=\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b0\u30fb\u30b5\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sacul, Jorg}}\n[[Category:Alliance Starfighter Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Combat instructors and training officers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
