However, the individual was able to graduate from the [[University/Legends|University]] despite barely passing his final exams and remained on the Republic's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], eventually developing a cure for a minor flesh-eating [[virus]] known as [[Zabrak Scalp Necrosis]]. The fame that the achievement brought him saw the doctor appointed as acting head of the [[Republic Health Administration]], something that Kimble believed was only possible because the man had bribed his way to the position.<ref name=\"Opportunity Knocks\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe doctor was first mentioned in the conversation \"Opportunity Knocks\" with the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] class' companion character Kimble, who goes by the name \"Doc\" in the [[2011]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''.
