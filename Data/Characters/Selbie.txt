Selbie and the planet's [[Lord]] [[Regent]], the [[Jedi]] [[Rael Averross]], maintained a sporadic sexual relationship during his [[time]] there.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> Around [[40 BBY]],<ref name=\"Date\">{{MasterApprenticedate}}</ref> Averross visited the [[cantina]] that Selbie worked at with a group of [[Pijal varactyl]] riders, coming from the [[Palace stables|stables]] connected to the [[Pijali palace]].

The patron became incensed upon Selbie's casual dismissal, starting to insult the regent and laud himself in comparison. However, when Averross brandished his [[lightsaber]] at the [[Chagrian]], the patron began to back out of the cantina. Although the Chagrian threatened to report Averross to Pijal's authorities, Selbie gleefully informed him that the Jedi was the ruling regent of the planet. After the patron left, Averross and Selbie briefly greeted each other, but were interrupted by an alarm calling him back to the Pijali palace.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n[[Standard day|Days]] later, Selbie spent the night with Averross in the [[regent's quarters]] of the Pijali palace. When [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] visited the quarters, he found them in bed together. Jinn's arrival prompted the embarrassed hostess to quickly gather her belongings and leave, despite Averross's protests. Although Averross defended his decision to indulge in Selbie's companionship, Jinn felt it was inappropriate for a Jedi. Averross remained unrepentant, lamenting Selbie's quick exit.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I'm guessin' ''you'' don't have an arrangement with the local innkeeper, unless Selbie's better at time management than I thought.|Rael Averross, to Qui-Gon Jinn|audio=Selbie3.ogg|Master & Apprentice}}\nSelbie was a flirtatious and confident individual who possessed a risqu\u00e9 sense of humor.
