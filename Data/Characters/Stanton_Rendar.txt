He wanted to prove himself as a capable [[Pilot/Legends|starship pilot]] on his own terms.\n\nHe was piloting the bulk freighter ''[[Doriella's Mystress]]'' on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] when the ship's control systems failed, causing it to lose control and crash into [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] private museum. Stanton was [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe freighter had been sabotaged by [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]], who had made an offer to the Rendars to make RenTrans a part of his company, [[Xizor Transport Systems/Legends|Xizor Transport Systems]]. When they refused, he arranged the accident, hoping to either scare the Rendars into selling, or disgrace them in the eyes of the Emperor. Palpatine was enraged by the destruction of his museum and seized RenTrans' assets, banished the Rendars from the Core Worlds and threw their younger son Dash out of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Academy of Carida]].\n\n===Human replica droid===\n{{Main|Stanton Rendar (droid)}}\nYears later, after Dash Rendar had become a [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] and mercenary, he met [[Guri]], a highly advanced [[Human replica droid]] (HRD) who had once worked for [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]]. When he learned of Guri's origins, he partnered with her to create [[Onadax Droid Technologies]] (ODT), a company that eventually developed a process to place the essence of a living being into an HRD. He used this technology to recreate his brother Stanton.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Shadow Games]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (novel)|''Shadows of the Empire'' novel]] {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*[[Shadows of the Empire (junior novelization)|''Shadows of the Empire'' junior novelization]] {{Imo}}\n*{{InsiderCite|75|Or Die Trying}} {{C|Human replica droid}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Secrets of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook]]'' {{1stID}}\n*{{KennerCite|set=Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (toy line)|text=''Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire''|pack=Dash Rendar|link=soteKdash.asp|archiveurl=https://archive.is/jxCYB}} {{Imo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Limited Collector's Edition|''Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire'' Limited Collector's Edition]] {{Imo}}\n*{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/89/indexp3.html|text=Underworld Appendix: Swoops, Spice, and Wretched Rogues|int=Underworld Appendix: Swoops, Spice, and Wretched Rogues}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|dashrendar|Rendar, Dash|archivedate=20110819144848}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'' {{Imo}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Stanton Rendar\n|es=Stanton Rendar\n|pt=Stanton Rendar\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rendar, Stanton}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
