After living on the streets as a child, Gistang was taken in by the local [[Imperial Mission]] and was eventually selected for service in the [[Stormtrooper Corps/Legends|Stormtrooper Corps]]. She quickly found a home as a [[Heavy weapon specialist|heavy-weapons expert]] with [[Joker Squad]] in the [[407th Stormtrooper Division]] and was put in charge of the [[Squad/Legends|unit's]] [[BB-23 heavy blaster cannon]], known as the \"big gun.\"\n\nWhen [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Gil Cassel]] informed Joker Squad that the 407th would be conducting a mission on [[Borosk/Legends|Borosk]] to destroy the [[908th Stormtrooper Division]], which had defected to the [[Empire-in-exile|forces]] of displaced [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]], Gistang angrily disagreed with [[Death/Legends|killing]] fellow stormtroopers and even argued that the members of Joker Squad should join Fel themselves. Gistang reluctantly participated in the [[Battle of Borosk (137 ABY)|Battle of Borosk]] when Joker Squad was ordered into action, but she was killed during the second [[Standard day/Legends|day]] of fighting when one of her spare [[power pack]]s for the big gun was hit by a stray [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] bolt, causing it to explode and vaporize her.\n\n==Biography==\n===Joker Squad===\n{{Quote|What's ''your'' story?''\"<br />\"''Not much to tell.

Gistang joined the other members of Joker Squad in forming a betting pool on how long Trask would survive; she wagered ten [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] that he would only last six [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]] after touchdown, knowing that new [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] did not typically live long. After Trask received an icy welcome from the squad, Gistang casually suggested that he relax and not take it personal and explained to the newcomer that his standard-issue equipment would be traded for other, more valuable items that Joker Squad would need.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" />\n\nMoments later, Cassel arrived with news that the [[908th Stormtrooper Division]] was planning to defect to Fel's [[Empire-in-exile|forces]]. He explained that [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Morlish Veed]] and the [[Council of Moffs]], wanting to keep the [[908th's Headquarters|908th's base]] on [[Borosk/Legends|Borosk]] intact, had ordered the 407th to eliminate the traitors. Gistang was the first to openly question the order, expressing shock that she and her unit were being sent to [[Death/Legends|kill]] fellow stormtroopers, but Cassel quickly silenced her objection, noting that the 908th was no longer their ally after deciding to go rogue. Cassel also added that Joker Squad would be going into action under the overall command of [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Maleval]] due to Krayt's uncertainty that the 407th would not defect as well.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" /> Despite everything, the troopers of Joker Squad agreed that their job was to carry out their orders, and they set out to capture the 908th's headquarters building.<ref name=\"CSWE-Gistang\" />\n\n===Death at Borosk===\n{{Quote|You ''have'' to hear it, Lieutenant!

Gaining confidence in battle for the first [[Time/Legends|time]], Trask covered Gistang's back for the remainder of the [[Standard day/Legends|day's]] fighting. The 407th finally succeeded in securing a gun platform and was then allowed to rest for the night.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" />\n\n[[File:RestInPieces-SWL04.png|thumb|right|225px|Jes Gistang was killed on Borosk after one of her spare power packs was hit and exploded.]]\nWhile they were resting, Gistang noticed that Trask was worn down from his first day in combat and asked him if the battle was what he had expected. Trask told her that he had joined the 407th to follow in the footsteps of his [[Anson Trask's father|father]], a proud former member of the unit, and wondered aloud what he would have thought about killing fellow troopers. Gistang then told Trask briefly about her own past before running through the different personalities of the other members of Joker Squad. Meanwhile, Maleval confronted Cassel, ordering Joker Squad to lead the upcoming attack the following day and kill every last member of the 908th as traitors, despite the squad's distaste for fighting other stormtroopers. Maleval warned the members of Joker Squad that he would be watching and would slaughter them all himself if they faltered in their mission.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" />\n\nJoker Squad trooper [[Hondo Karr]] brandished his [[vibroknife]] behind Maleval's back, prompting the Sith Lord to [[Telekinesis/Legends|Force push]] the trooper to the ground, which created an uproar among Joker Squad. Gistang started after Maleval herself, but Harkas forcibly ordered her to stand down,<ref name=\"Legacy4\" /> even though all the troopers of Joker Squad secretly wished to kill the Sith Lord.<ref name=\"CSWE-Joker\" /> After Maleval departed, Gistang angrily argued to Cassel that the Borosk operation was wrong and that maybe they should join the 908th, walk away and abandon the entire war, or even allow the 908th to escape. However, Harkas reminded them all of their duty as troopers, and Gistang reluctantly agreed with the others to complete the mission.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" />\n\nWhen the battle resumed, Joker Squad breached the main [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]] of the 908th around midday. Inside the building's corridors, the fighting descended into [[Unarmed combat|hand-to-hand combat]], but Joker Squad continued to push on and eventually rushed into what had been the main mess hall. The 908th had set up gun emplacements on the upper-level walkways, and a stray [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] bolt from above struck one of the extra [[power pack]]s that Gistang carried on her [[Utility belt/Legends|utility belt]] for use with the big gun. The resulting explosion vaporized Gistang and also caused major injury to Harkas. Nevertheless, the 407th proceeded to capture the enemy fortress, while the 908th fought to the bitter end.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Lieutenant, we're supposed to fire on our ''own?!<nowiki></nowiki>|Jes Gistang|Legacy (2006) 4}}\n[[File:GistangDissents-SWL04.png|thumb|right|225px|Jes Gistang angrily objects to Joker Squad's mission to kill fellow stormtroopers.]]\nJes Gistang considered Imperial service a better option than any of the alternatives available to her<ref name=\"Legacy4\" /> after living on the streets as a child.<ref name=\"CSWE-Gistang\" /> She quickly found a home among the 407th Stormtrooper Division and became a talented and responsible soldier<ref name=\"Gentle Giant\" /> whose expertise with heavy weaponry<ref name=\"CSWE-Gistang\" /> made her effective in combat. Gistang displayed a grim sense of humor about Anson Trask's chances of survival when he first joined Joker Squad and bet in a pool to wager how long the rookie would live. After Trask survived his first combat experience, which included saving Gistang's life, she approached him and shared some scant details of her background.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" />\n\nAlready quietly questioning her loyalty to [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt's Empire,<ref name=\"CSWE-Gistang\" /> Gistang felt deeply uncomfortable with Joker Squad's orders to wipe out a fellow stormtrooper unit that had defected to the enemy,<ref name=\"Legacy4\" /> an assignment that challenged both her ideals and her courage.<ref name=\"Gentle Giant\" /> She unhesitatingly voiced her angry opinion to her superior [[Officer/Legends|officer]], Lieutenant Gil Cassel, that their mission was wrong and that she and her fellow troopers were better off defecting themselves or deserting the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]] altogether. After Darth Maleval, also her superior, threatened Joker Squad's lives if they did not complete their mission and then attacked trooper Hondo Karr, an enraged Gistang even had to be held back from going after the Sith Lord. However, Gistang's sense of duty ultimately convinced her to fight in the battle, in which she was killed.<ref name=\"Legacy4\" />\n\nGistang was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] female with [[Color/Legends|red]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and light skin.
