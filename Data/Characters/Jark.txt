The city is much safer with those weapons back in our hands. We must now turn to the allies and organizers of this deed.|Captain Jark, to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Jark was a [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the Corellian Security Force, stationed in [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]]. [[Inspector/Legends|Inspector]] [[Cora (Human)|Cora]] was serving under his orders.<ref name=\"SWG:TtCJ\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> a ship piloted by CorSec Captain [[Donovan (captain)|Donovan]] and carrying a cargo of weapons to the local CorSec force in Tyrena apparently crashed near the city. Captain Jark ordered Cora to investigate the crash. Cora discovered that the criminals known as the [[Deflarians]] hijacked Donovan's ship and then crashed a ship of the same model to cover the theft of its cargo. Cora and a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] finally rescued Captain Donovan from the [[Deflarian bunker]] and recovered the ship and its cargo of weapons.<ref name=\"SWG:WHtD\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|What Happened to Donovan?|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ragtags_2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Ragtag/Deflarian meeting.]]\nIn the meanwhile, Captain Jark was interested to find those responsible for the theft of Captain Donovan's ship. Jark discovered that a traitorous CorSec agent named [[Jori]] sold to the [[Ragtags|Ragtag]] criminals information concerning the cargo of weapons, including Donovan's flight schedule. Lacking firepower to perform themselves the thief, the Ragtags hired the Deflarians to hijack the ship and steal the cargo. Jark thus sent spacers to raid a meeting between Deflarians and Ragtags. Jori was killed during the operation and the CorSec managed to retrieve vital information about Tyrena defense capabilities provided by the traitor to the Ragtags.<ref name=\"SWG:LtBB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Let the Buyer Beware|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJark appeared as a non-player character in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:TtCJ\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> {{PAGENAME}} was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 28 Notes for April 26, 2006|Publish 28]]\", on [[April 26]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=en_US/players/content.vm?page=Current%20Publish|text=Publish 28 Update Notes, April 26th|archivedate=20060427125323}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:Let_the_Buyer_Beware_(card).JPG|cardname=Let the Buyer Beware}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Talk to Captain Jark}}\n\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
