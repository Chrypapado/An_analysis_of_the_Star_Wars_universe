Flying with both [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green]] and later [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadrons]], by the time of the [[Battle of Yavin]] he was a veteran pilot and had reached the status of [[Ace|double ace]]. However, he met his demise as Red Squadron fought to destroy the [[Death Star]] at [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], shot down by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader's]] [[TIE Advanced x1]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Imperial Era]], Puck Naeco joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] in its fight against the [[Galactic Empire]], serving as a [[pilot]] in the [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps|Alliance Starfighter Corps]].<ref name=\"Duty Roster\" /> In the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]], Naeco flew in [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green Squadron]], under the [[callsign]] [[Green Twelve]]. Before the [[Battle of Scarif]], Naeco broke his ankle in a rough landing forcing him to vacate his spot in Green Squadron. He was replaced as Green Twelve by [[Lieutenant]] [[Wion Dillems]], who flew in this capacity at the Battle of [[Scarif]].<ref name=\"UVG\" />\n\n===Battle of Yavin===\nFollowing his recovery, Naeco became part of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], under [[Red Leader]] [[Commander]] [[Garven Dreis]]<ref name=\"UVG\" /><ref name=\"Duty Roster\" /> The veteran pilot grew to enjoy teasing his younger comrades, which led to friction in the squadron \u2014 manifesting itself in several confrontations with [[Col Takbright]].<ref name=\"Duty Roster\" /> During the approach of the [[Death Star]], Naeco, along with his fellow pilots, attended the briefing held by [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]], where the commander of the [[Massassi Group]] described their objective: destruction of the [[battlestation]] via [[Proton torpedo|torpedoing]] of the [[thermal exhaust port]] leading to the station's [[Reactor|main reactor]].<ref name=\"Duty Roster\" /><ref name=\"ANH\" /> Naeco, along with [[Red Four]] [[John D. Branon]], noticed Takbright's outburst criticizing the plan and pressed him on it afterwards.<ref name=\"Duty Roster\" />\n\nNaeco, at this point a [[Ace|double ace]] with 5,879 flight [[Standard hour|hours]] and eleven confirmed kills,<ref name=\"Grounded\">{{Shortstory|story=Grounded|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> was selected by Dreis to fly with him and [[Theron Nett]] in the Red Squadron's [[first flight]], taking the portside position as [[Red Twelve]].<ref name=\"Duty Roster\" /> Following the demise of the original flight of [[Gold Squadron]] [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing bombers]] intended to fire the torpedoes, Dreis' flight entered the [[meridian trench]] of the Death Star and prepared to take the shot.<ref name=\"Duty Roster\" /> However, despite the warnings of Red Leader, Naeco's [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighter]] would be the first destroyed by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], as he pursued the flight in his [[TIE Advanced x1]]. His X-Wing exploded, and crashed against the wall of the trench. Both Nett and Dreis were also shot down soon after, though [[Luke Skywalker|Red Five]] was able to successfully take the shot and destroy the station.<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nAs part of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], this pilot wore the customary [[Color|Orange]] [[Flight suit|jumpsuit]], and a [[Flight helmet|helmet]]<ref name=\"ANH\" /> similar to [[Wes Janson]]'s.{{Fact}} His skin was light.<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|When Red 10 gets shot down, the pilot we see die is someone else \u2013 a previously unseen male pilot with a helmet that looks like Janson's in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.
