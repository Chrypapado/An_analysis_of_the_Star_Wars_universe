Typical. So be it. This is the situation: some small cybernetic labs in the area have recently been the victims of several break-ins.|Lieutenant Tarc to a spacer|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Orden Tarc held the rank of [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] of the Royal Naboo Security Forces and was stationed in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Narmle (city)|Narmle]], on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo's]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Rori/Legends|Rori]]. He served as a liaison officer between the RSF and the [[Narmle Militia]], the local police force, a complex position since Narmle Militia members were quite reluctant to work with the Royal Naboo Security Forces.<ref name=\"SWG:LOT\" />\n\nCirca [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Lieutenant Tarc requested the assistance of the Narmle Militia to investigate into a number of break-ins at [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] labs on Rori; but the Militia only dispatched an independent spacer. Nonetheless, Tarc decided to make use of the spacer to find the perpetrator.<ref name=\"SWG:LOT\" /> Tarc first dispatched the spacer to the [[Cybernetics Lab]] in Narmle that was the location of the most recent break-in. The spacer discovered that an individual known as [[Ponda Baba/Legends|Ponda Baba]] attempted to log onto one of the lab data terminals. According to RSF records, Ponda Baba was an [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] small-time thug who usually worked out of the [[Tatoo system/Legends|Tatooine system]]. Tarc figured out that Baba was looking for cybernetics after he [[Cho sun/Legends|lost]] an arm in an [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|altercation]] in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. Lieutenant Tarc then ordered the spacer to interrogate local criminals, the [[Neo-Cobral]] and the [[Garyn Raiders]], to find Ponda Baba. The spacer visited the [[Neo-Cobral Base]] and the [[Garyn Raider Base]], and the Garyn Raiders finally revealed that Baba approached them but they refused to work with him. As the spacer learned how to contact Ponda Baba from the Garyn Raiders, the spacer arranged a meeting with the Aqualish. However, Baba sent henchmen from the [[Gundark gang]] to attack the spacer. Lieutenant Tarc therefore dispatchd the spacer to the [[Gundark Base]]. There, a Gundark thug revealed that the Aqualish was hiding out at a small camp on the outskirts of Narmle. The spacer finally confronted Ponda Baba but the latter managed to escape and eventually left the moon. Lieutenant Tarc later released Ponda Baba's name and a holographic image to all security forces in the Naboo system. This would prevent the criminal to come back in this part of the galaxy and Tarc considered the case closed.<ref name=\"SWG:RHM\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=class|Legacy|Right Handless Man|Rori}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nOrden Tarc was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:LOT\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Orden Tarc was added to the game with the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Game Update 12|Game Update 12]]\", on [[August 10]], [[2009]].<ref>{{SonyForumsCite|url=swg/posts/list.m?topic_id=976424|text=Game Update 12: Engineering Trader|archivedate=20090816090206}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Lieutenant Orden Tarc}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarc, Orden}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Royal Naboo Security Force officers]]"}}}]}}}}
