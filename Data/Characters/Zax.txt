There are many bounties available here, legal or otherwise. But they all pay quite well.|Zak welcoming potential bounty collectors|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n\n'''Zax''' was a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] criminal who worked in the Lower City of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] during the [[Jedi Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\nOfficially, Zax ran the Taris government [[Bounty/Legends|bounty]] office, but also had an agreement with [[Davik Kang]] that allowed the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] to post his \"special contracts.\" He also had some underground business connections with the ancestors of the [[House of Organa/Legends|House of Organa]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\nHe had an excellent network of informants that kept track of both [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] and bounties. This worked to his and the hunters' advantages, as he always knew if a job had been carried out, and the hunters didn't have to bring in bodies. However, his [[Spy/Legends|spies]] weren't infallible; an amnesic [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] was able to fool them into thinking [[Matrik]] was dead by demolishing his apartment with a [[permacrete detonator]] after the [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] had left. Some of his bounties were [[Dia]], [[Largo]], the aforementioned Matrik, [[Selven]] and [[Gorse Bendak|Bendak Starkiller]]. However, they didn't pay all that well, so Zax's office usually just attracted [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]]-a-dozen bounty hunters instead of skilled professionals like [[Calo Nord]].<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe bounties Zax offers the player in [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|''Knights of the Old Republic'']] are all worth 300 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. A player with a high Persuasion can convince Zax to pay 400 credits instead, and Zax will admire the player for having the courage to bargain with a Hutt.\n\nIt is unknown whether Zax survived the bombing of Taris by the Sith fleet. He lives in the Lower City, so his chances would be better than those of [[Ajuur]], the Hutt living in the upper city who runs the dueling ring, but as intense and devastating as the bombing was, and as slow as Hutts move, Zax may not have survived.\n\nTwo of Zax's posted contracts are from the Taris government: Bendak Starkiller and Selven. The rest are illegally posted at the behest of Davik Kang or one of his associates.\n\nHis voice was provided by [[Neil Kaplan]] in the game.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Adjudicator Special Report: Tools of the Trade]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Zax\n|pl=Zax\n|ru=\u0417\u0430\u043a\u0441\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Hutts]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]"}}}]}}}}
