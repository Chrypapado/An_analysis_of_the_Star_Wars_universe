Hoclaw went on to keep Solo occupied for some [[Time/Legends|time]], debating with him points such as the cost of rebuilding and what portion of it would Corellia be obligated to [[Currency/Legends|pay]]. She quickly demanded that Solo himself step down as Chief of State as an act of cooperation, indicating such a gesture would earn favor with the [[Confederation]], a [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] government which arose in opposition to the Galactic Alliance. However, Solo refused and ruled out the suggestion.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n===Death===\n{{Quote|Captain, you've heard my terms. I will not budge on any of them.

Anticipating that the negotiations were a trap, Solo abruptly cut them off, granting Hoclaw ten [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]] to accept his demands. It was during the break in negotiations that Hoclaw contacted [[Denjax Teppler]], Corellian [[Minister of Information (Five Worlds)|Minister of Information]], who was onboard Centerpoint. Hoclaw informed him of the interlude and indicated that she believed she could continue stalling Solo, which would give the Corellians the time needed to make Centerpoint operational.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n[[File:CenterpointStation-SoF.png|thumb|right|250px|The firing of Centerpoint Station's superweapon resulted in Hoclaw's death.]]\nUltimately, Hoclaw's stalling efforts failed. Aboard his personal [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]], the [[Anakin Solo (Imperial II-class Star Destroyer)|''Anakin Solo'']], Jacen Solo and his [[Parent/Legends|mother]], [[Leia Organa Solo]], determined based on the analysis of background noise from the ''Valorum''{{'s}} [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] that it only contained a skeleton crew and that the meeting was likely a trap. Centerpoint Station's [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]] was made operational moments later, with Corellia deploying numerous [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ships]] and [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] from [[Force Yimi]] and [[Force Zexx]] to engage Alliance forces and keep them occupied until the station could be fired. Upon the weapon's activation, both the Corellian decoy [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] and the majority of the [[Galactic Alliance Second Fleet]] were destroyed, [[Death/Legends|killing]] Hoclaw in the process, although both Jacen and the ''Anakin Solo'' escaped.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|&hellip;asking us to bear a tremendously disproportionate burden of the cost of rebuilding. If I agree to the numbers you suggest, the Corellian system would be reduced to poverty for generations. No, that's not justice. That's vindictiveness, and it presupposes that the entire burden of blame, that every wrong done in the course of these events, should be laid at the feet of the Corellian government.|Hoclaw, to Jacen Solo|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nA long-faced woman, Hoclaw rebuffed any attempt by the younger Jacen Solo to intimidate her. While she was never meant to reach a peace agreement with Solo, the captain nonetheless steadfastly stood her ground against his demands for surrender, instead insinuating the Chief of State's demands would only prolong negotiations while maintaining a friendly demeanor toward him. When Solo pushed for Corellia to pay for a large portion of rebuilding, she refused, calling his suggestion a vindictive presumption that Corellia was to blame for the conflict and noting that it would reduce the Corellian system to poverty for generations.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHoclaw first appeared in [[Aaron Allston]]'s [[2007]] novel ''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'', the seventh volume in the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy of the Force]]'' series.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'' {{1st|[[Legacy of the Force: Fury (audiobook)|''Legacy of the Force: Fury'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Legacy of the Force: Fury (audiobook)|''Legacy of the Force: Fury'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Captains]]\n[[Category:Confederation military personnel]]\n[[Category:Corellian Defense Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
