She caught the eye of a very young smuggler, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who had just escaped an ambush and was repairing his ship. Bornan was behaving like a jealous boyfriend and Solo contemplated trying to steal Aryn away, but decided she was too much of a classy lady.\n\nAfter her husband's untimely death in [[24 ABY/Legends|24 ABY]], Aryn ran Bornaryn alone, but had some assistance from her brother-in-law [[Tyko Thul|Tyko]].\n\nHer reaction to the disappearance of her son [[Raynar Thul|Raynar]] while on the [[Mission to Myrkr|Myrkr mission]] went unrecorded, as did her activities during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. However, in [[35 ABY/Legends|35 ABY]], she was informed by [[Tesar Sebatyne]] that Raynar was alive, but fainted when she was told what had become of him. Nevertheless, she did send out the supply ships that Raynar had requested through Tesar.\n\nIn [[36 ABY]], Aryn bought out the popular [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] restaurant [[Yuza Bre]] to spite [[Cal Omas]]. After an exchange with [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] over Raynar's fate while dining at Yuza Bre, she provided them with a R-series prototype [[Droid/Legends|droid]]. The prototype was useful in that in had an [[OmniGate]] that could be used to override [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2's]] sequestered memory sectors.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAryn Dro Thul had chestnut brown hair, blue eyes, and wore a blue robe with a sash made up of the colors of the [[House of Thul]]&mdash;purple, gold, and red.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Paradise Snare]]''\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Shards of Alderaan]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Delusions of Grandeur]]''\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: The Emperor's Plague]]''\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Crisis at Crystal Reef]]''\n*''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''\n*''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Aryn Dro Thul\n|ja=\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30c9\u30ed\u30fb\u30b9\u30fc\u30eb\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thul, Aryn Dro}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:House of Thul]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
