They're trying to kill me!|Skall Delos|Peaces}}\n'''Skall Delos''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who made a living as a [[Podracing/Legends|podracer]], during the waning years of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].\n\n==Biography==\n===A career as a podracer===\nDelos was born on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] and spent his childhood exploring the [[Planet/Legends|planet's]] vast open expanses. When he was 12, he saw a [[Holovid/Legends|holovid]] of a podrace for the first time, and he immediately became obsessed with the sport. He spent all his spare time researching it and learning about new pilots to the sport. When he turned 18, he joined the Alderaanian military, where he trained as a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]]. He became skilled at his job and planned to become a podracer when he finished his tour of duty with the military.\n\nFollowing his discharge, he made his way to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] in search of his new career. However, he soon learned that Humans weren't considered skilled enough to be podracers. After several years, he joined the [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] [[Von Qesta]] as his team's pilot. With Qesta as his partner, he was able to become one of the top ten pilots on the podracing circuit, and he began racing in a modified [[Sorin v3 Avalon]] pod.\n\n===Trouble on Cularin===\nDelos was friends with the [[Slicer/Legends|slicer]] [[Barrit Bosch]], and after Bosch was hired by [[Alina Impeveri]] to create a forged recording implicating her father, Counselor [[Westa Impeveri]], in having dealings with the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]], Bosch gave a copy of the recording to Delos. However, Bosch was killed shortly afterwards, and Delos vowed to avenge his friend. He traveled to the planet [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] to race in the [[Cularin Swamp Run]], which he planned to win and then announce from the winner's podium that the castigation of Counselor Impeveri was false.\n\nOn arrival on Cularin, Delos contacted the office of Counselor Impeveri, telling them that he had information that could clear Impeveri of all the charges that he faced, but that he wouldn't be releasing the information until after the race. He also contacted the [[Metatheran Cartel]] and told them that the person who had hired Bosch had done so to undermine all traders in the [[Cularin system]], including the Cartel. As a result, both Impeveri and the Cartel had reason to ensure that Delos survived the race.\n\nThe race began, but Alina Impeveri and her thugs caused Delos's pod to crash and then tried to find him, to prevent him from revealing that it was she who had ordered the creation of the recording. However, he evaded capture. The Cartel hired the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents, to find Delos and bring him back, and they set out to the crash site. To confuse them, Impeveri placed [[Mind trick/Legends|Force illusions]] on three of her minions: [[Tot]], [[Aeios]] and [[Naren]], to make them all resemble Delos. However, just after the heroes encountered them, Delos ran over to them and begged them to help him. They rescued him, and with they information he provided, Westa Impeveri was vindicated.\n\n==Personality and traits==\nDelos was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], although he did not know it. He was multi-lingual and in addition to [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]], he could speak [[Bothese]] and [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Peaces]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delos, Skall}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Force-sensitives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Podracers]]"}}}]}}}}
