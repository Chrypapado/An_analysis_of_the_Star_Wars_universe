In response to a [[krayt dragon]] threatening the town, its [[marshal]], [[Cobb Vanth]], agreed to work with the [[Mandalorian]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Din Djarin]] and a nearby tribe of [[Tusken Raider]]s to defeat the dragon, with Djarin volunteering the residents of Mos Pelgo to assist in the [[Mission to Tatooine (Din Djarin)|fight]]. As the Mos Pelgo residents and Tusken Raiders prepared a trap for the krayt dragon, Jo armed the explosives that had been placed beneath the sand. She passed the [[detonator]] to Vanth, advising the marshal to be careful. Jo survived the battle against the krayt dragon and helped the Tuskens and the other villagers strip its carcass.<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nJo appeared in \"[[Chapter 9: The Marshal]],\" the premiere of the [[The Mandalorian Season Two|second season]] of the television series ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', released on [[Disney+]]<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" /> on [[October 30]], [[2020]].<ref name=\"D23\">{{D23|everything-new-you-can-stream-on-disney-in-october-2020/|Everything New You Can Stream on Disney+ in October 2020|archivedate=20201016204229}}</ref> She was portrayed by [[Karisma Gideon]].<ref name=\"Chapter 9\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 9: The Marshal}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Jo\n|es=Jo\n|fr=Jo\n|ja=\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\uff08\u4eba\u9593\uff09\n|ka=\u10ef\u10dd\n|nl=Jo\n|pl=Jo\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
