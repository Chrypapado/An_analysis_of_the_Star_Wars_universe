Granted his position by the [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]-wide crime syndicate [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]], he served as an informant for them, gathering valuable intelligence on the denizens of the district. Uscru attracted people from all walks of life, from [[Senator/Legends|senators]] to shady characters, as the district covered a significant amount of altitude, from the upper levels to the underworld. Acros-Krik would guide and treat those with a kindly financial disposition, accepting bribes from corrupt officials.\n\nHe kept his hand in both the high life and the criminal underworld, hiring the [[Nalle triplets|Nalle triplet]] [[Spy/Legends|spies]] to keep an [[Eye/Legends|eye]] on those he wanted monitored. He had associations with felons such as the [[Baath brothers/Legends|Baath brothers]], but he kept a presence amongst the more reputable citizens, painting for himself the image of a kindly father figure who was striving for a better Uscru Entertainment District. This stance, in Black Sun's opinion, garnered unwanted attention.\n\n==Biography==\n===Ascension===\nThe [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Ongree/Legends|Ongree]] Acros-Krik lived in the last [[Standard year/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and was affiliated with the crime syndicate [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]]. Intending to gain a new resource of [[Politics/Legends|political]] Republic information, Black Sun inserted Acros-Krik as the [[Mayor/Legends|mayor]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant's]] [[Uscru Entertainment District/Legends|Uscru Entertainment District]]; since the district was in close proximity to the [[Senate District]], Black Sun would be able to gain access to the upper echelons of the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital's]] political cadre. With a rigged election, Acros-Krik was installed by Black Sun as the District's mayor. In return for this service, he would work as an informer, passing along valuable nuggets of information to his criminal superiors. Uscru, covering both the physical upper and lower portions of Coruscant, allowed Acros-Krik to meet with all walks of life. Eventually, it was understood that if a being wanted preferential treatment in Uscru, they would go to the mayor.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===Shady operations===\nUscru wallowed in crime and corruption, and Acros-Krik was far from having his hands clean in both matters. However, instead of keeping a low profile like his affiliates, he made sure he was visible to all of his citizens, and painted himself as a benevolent and boisterous leader. Utilizing his connections with both the Black Sun and the Republic, he was confident enough to walk the [[City/Legends|city]] streets amongst the denizens, and in [[Time/Legends|time]], he came to be viewed as a father figure whom others could look to for guidance.<ref name=\"db\" /> He came under potential threat when, in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], an [[Airspeeder/Legends|airspeeder]] piloted by the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Zam Wesell/Legends|Zam Wesell]] crashed near him in the lower levels, but he emerged unscathed.<ref name=\"aotc\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>\n\nThe truth of Acros-Krik's administration was far less glamorous. He had ties to the notorious [[Baath brothers/Legends|Baath brothers]] and other assorted lowlifes, and would constantly monitor his guests. He enlisted the services of the [[Nalle triplets|Nalle triplet]] [[Spy/Legends|spies]] for monitoring operations, which aided his primary mission: gathering information for Black Sun. In time, however, Black Sun grew wary of his disposition and lack of subtlety, and became concerned with their Uscru mayor.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThough he was enlisted and bonded to the shady and secretive Black Sun crime syndicate, Acros-Krik had a gregarious disposition, and deliberately got close to his people. In turn, they regarded him with great affection, possibly dissuading any thoughts they may have had in regards to his less kindly side. Acros-Krik would enlist the services of locals to do his bidding, as in the case of the Nalle triplets, and would personally aid any politicians hoping to enjoy a favorable experience in Uscru. Though his modus operandi clashed with Black Sun technique, his connections in high places afforded him a great deal of confidence in his work.<ref name=\"db\" /> Acros-Krik was a patron of [[Dex's Diner/Legends|Dex's Diner]], a dining establishment that was located in the [[CoCo Town/Legends|CoCo Town]] district of Coruscant, and he liked eating the diner's [[nerfsteak sandwich]]es.<ref name=\"Dining at Dex's\">{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/source/dexdiner/index.html|text=Dining at Dex's|int=Dining at Dex's}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Acros-Krik first appeared in [[George Lucas]]'s [[2002]] film [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']], wherein the computer-generated character model of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Pablo-Jill/Legends|Pablo-Jill]] was inserted into a crowd for the \"Coruscant Chase\" sequence.<ref name=\"aotcdvd\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] DVD-ROM commentary</ref> The character was later fleshed out and given a name by [[Gregory Walker]] through the [[StarWars.com]] [[Hyperspace: The Official Star Wars Fan Club|Hyperspace]] feature ''[[What's The Story?]]'' Walker was inspired by the [[Wikipedia:Anime|anime]] television series [[Wikipedia:Macross|''Macross'']], for which he named the character. The name was also partly derived from that of [[Wikipedia:Austin, Texas|Austin, Texas]] mayor [[Wikipedia:Kirk Watson|Kirk Watson]]. Walker additionally established a conclusion for Acros-Krik's story, involving Black Sun ousting him and the Ongree taking up residence in the [[Oseon system]], but this was cut from the final entry.<ref name=\"blog\">{{Blog|narbflick|8|Acros-Krik: The Story Behind the Story|Narb Flick Created Leffingites|Gregory Walker|archivedate=20081123032648}}</ref> The information from the entry was later used in [[2008]]'s ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Hyperspace|url=fans/hyperspace/source/dexdiner/index.html|text=Dining at Dex's|int=Dining at Dex's}} {{Mo}}\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] {{C|DVD-ROM In-depth commentary}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|acros_krik|Acros-Krik|archivedate=20100329224919}} {{1stID}}\n*{{DB|character|lelamayn|Mayn, Lela Nalle|archivedate=20100202123346}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Blog|narbflick|8|Acros-Krik: The Story Behind the Story|Narb Flick Created Leffingites|Gregory Walker|archivedate=20081123032648}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Acros-Krik\n|nl=Acros-Krik\n|ja=\u30a2\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\uff1d\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\n|pl=Acros-Krik\n|ru=\u0410\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441-\u041a\u0440\u0438\u043a\n}}\n\n[[Category:Black Sun members]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Galactic Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mayors]]\n[[Category:Ongree]]"}}}]}}}}
