In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]], sending Trey and Driscoll, as well as thousands of [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] refugees to Alderaan's sister planet [[Delaya/Legends|Delaya]]. When [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] visited Delaya to help the refugees, as well as recruit soldiers for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], Trey and his brother were among an Alderaanian faction that resented Organa's involvement with the Rebellion, blaming her for their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld's]] destruction. Their group abducted Organa then planned to turn her over to the Empire in exchange for a new planet to settle on. However, the Imperials reneged on the deal and took Organa after killing her abductors. Trey and his brother were the first to die, acting as guards to their group's hideout.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Rebel Force: Hostage]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bruhnej, Trey}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
