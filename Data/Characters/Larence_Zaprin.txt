He and [[Zaprin family|his family]] lived in the [[Zaprin Estate]] in the remote mountain wilderness of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]].\n\nIn [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], a group of sick [[Narglatch/Legends|narglatchs]] and [[Mott/Legends|motts]] surrounded his home. When his children [[Mia Zaprin|Mia]] and [[Jowres Zaprin|Jowres]] left the house, they were attacked and infected with an unknown illness. Zaprin sent an urgent request for a [[Doctor/Legends|doctor]] to help his sick children. A short time later, a [[Medic/Legends|medic]] sent by the [[2-1B surgical droid|2-1B droid]] [[Billingsly]] reached the Zaprin estate and managed to create an anti-toxin to cure the children. Zaprin didn't have enough money to pay the medic the full amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], so he gave him a [[Field Surgeon Pistol]] to cover the remainder of the cost.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLarence Zaprin was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:HC\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Larence Zaprin was added to the game upon the release of the \"[[W:c:swg:Publish 25 Notes for November 15, 2005|Publish 25]]\", a.k.a. the \"[[W:c:swg:New Game Enhancements|New Game Enhancements]]\", on [[November 15]], [[2005]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64886&resource=publish|text=Publish Archive 2005|archivedate=20111124002055}}</ref>\n\nLarence Zaprin could be found in a remote building in the Nabooian mountains south-east of the [[Varykino/Legends|Lake Retreat]].
