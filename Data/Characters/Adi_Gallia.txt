During the [[Clone Wars]], she served as a [[Jedi General]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and fought several battles over the course of the Republic&ndash;[[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] conflict.\n\nIn [[21 BBY]], Gallia rescued [[Eeth Koth]]&mdash;a fellow [[Jedi]] Master who had been [[Prisoner|captured]] by [[General]] [[Grievous]]&mdash;with the help of [[Jedi Knight]]s [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] during the [[Battle of Saleucami]].

Jinn also requested that a boy he found on [[Tatooine]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], be trained as a Jedi, as Jinn believed he was the [[Chosen One]]. Gallia, along with the rest of the Jedi Council, was skeptical of this claim, and even though agreeing to test Skywalker, denied him training because he was too old and has had relationships and is vulnerable to the Dark side of the Force. After Jinn's death at the hands of [[Maul|Darth Maul]] during the Battle of Naboo, Gallia and the Council agreed to allow Obi-Wan Kenobi to train Skywalker as his apprentice to fulfill Jinn's dying wish. Gallia also was present at Jinn's funeral.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n===Separatist Crisis===\n[[File:Jedicouncil2.jpg|thumb|Gallia stands ready in council]]\nGallia still served on the Council ten years after the invasion of Naboo. During this time thousands of star systems joined a [[Separatist Crisis|secessionist movement]] who wanted independence from the [[Galactic Republic]]. The council feared that if a pan-[[The galaxy|galactic]] war to break out they wouldn't have enough manpower to defend the Republic from the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] threat. Around this time the life of [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] was threatened by an [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|assassination attempt]], causing the Council to assign Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as protection for the Senator. This eventually lead to Obi-Wan discovering that a [[Clone trooper|Clone army]] was being [[Cloning|manufactured]] in secret on the world of [[Kamino]] at the request of Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]], who had perished some years prior. Gallia was present on Coruscant when the Council was brought this news, troubled by this information the council sent Obi-Wan to [[Geonosis]] to track down the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]], who was the man responsible for the attempts on Amidala's life as well as providing the genetic template for the clone Army. This request ultimately lead to the beginning of the pan-galactic conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]], as the [[Confederacy military|Separatist army]] and the new [[Grand Army of the Republic]] fought each other in what would become known as the [[First Battle of Geonosis|first battle of Geonosis]].<ref>[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones]]</ref>\n\n===The Clone Wars===\n====Battle of Saleucami====\n=====Rescuing Eeth Koth=====\n{{Quote|So was that close enough for you?''\"<br />\"''Any closer, and we'd be flying down hallways.|Anakin Skywalker and Adi Gallia on the former's plan to infiltrate General Grievous' ship|Grievous Intrigue}}\n[[File:GalliaKenobiSkywalker.png|thumb|right|250px|Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Adi Gallia agree to rescue Eeth Koth from Grievous]]\nGallia attended a meeting alongside several other Jedi to watch a taunting message sent by [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Confederacy]] [[General]] [[Grievous]]. Grievous had captured Jedi Master and Gallia's fellow Council member [[Eeth Koth]], and in his message he tortured Koth and told the recipient Jedi how he only sought to see their Order fall. Several [[youngling]]s witnessed the recording and were quickly went out of the room. The remaining Jedi found resolve to bring Grievous to justice, but were at a loss as they had no way of identifying Koth's location. [[Clone army|Clone]] [[Commander]] [[Wolffe]] found a hidden message in the transmission, a series of hand signals from the captive Koth. Kenobi read Koth's message, finding that he was being held in the [[Saleucami system]]. Gallia was surprised at this, as [[Republic Intelligence]] had shown there to be no signs of Grievous' ships near the sector. Knowing where Koth was being held, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Gallia decided to mount a [[Battle of Saleucami|rescue mission]] to rescue Koth and take down Grievous.<ref name=\"GI\">{{TCW|Grievous Intrigue}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RexSkywalkerGallia.png|thumb|left|250px|Gallia and Skywalker make preparations to infiltrate Grievous' ship]]\nKenobi's plan was that he and his forces would enter battle with Grievous' fleet above Saleucami, then send the coordinates of the command ship to Skywalker and Gallia, who would jump into the battle from [[hyperspace]], undetected, and infiltrate Grievous' ship. Gallia asked Kenobi how he planned to stray Grievous away from his ship, to which Kenobi replied that he would be enough bait for the General to take. Kenobi and his forces entered hyperspace, upon which exiting they quickly came under fire from Grievous' fleet. Clone [[Captain]] [[Rex]], part of Gallia and Skywalker's team, received the coordinates from Kenobi. Gallia questioned how close Skywalker would near Grievous' ship once exiting hyperspace. Skywalker landed their ship underneath Grievous', undetected as planned, and Gallia remarked that had they been any closer they would be flying down hallways.<ref name=\"GI\" />\n\n[[File:GalliaSkywalkerBackToBack-GI.png|thumb|right|250px|Gallia and Skywalker defend themselves from a group of commando droids]]\nGallia, Skywalker, and their team of clones entered Grievous' ship, and split up. Gallia and Skywalker began towards the bridge, where Koth was being held. Kenobi, meanwhile, managed to bait Grievous onto his ship. The two Jedi entered the bridge, where they were soon surrounded by several [[BX-series droid commando|commando droids]]. The [[TV-94|tactical droid]] in charge of the ship began torturing Koth to near-death, but Skwalker severed the droid's arm to keep it from killing Koth. Gallia and Skywalker fought against the commando droids, destroying both them and the tactical droid. They released Koth from his restraints, but as the trio began making their way back to their ship, Kenobi reported that Grievous was making an escape back to his command ship. Skywalker took Koth back to their ship while Gallia left to help Kenobi in stopping Grievous.<ref name=\"GI\" />\n\n=====Engaging Grievous=====\n{{Quote|Master Gallia, you go ahead.

The Republic cruiser was fired upon by Grievous' ship, however, destroying the stabilizers and causing the ship to start exploding. The docking tube started breaking as the ships pulled away from each other, and Grievous made it back to his ship. Gallia began fighting Grievous before he could close the entrance to his ship. The docking tube split, however, and Grievous made his escape as Gallia, Kenobi, and the clones held on to the damaged docking tube to keep from entering space. Gallia managed to pull herself aboard Grievous' ship, where she fired a grappling hook for Kenobi and the remaining clones to grab onto. Once they were all on board, Gallia closed the door. Kenobi planned to continue his attempt to capture Grievous, but Gallia told him that Skywalker was leaving and they would be left behind if they were to stay. Skywalker told them to head towards a hangar near them, where they boarded his craft to escape the destruction of Grievous' flagship. Grievous himself had fled to the planet's surface, and Kenobi decided to pursue him further. Skywalker landed in the hangar of a Republic flagship, where Gallia and the injured Koth departed for a medical frigate.<ref name=\"GI\" />\n\n====Aftermath of the Devaron massacre ====\n[[File:BossTiinGallia-WotM.png|thumb|right|250px|Gallia was present when Master Halsey's body was returned to the temple.]]\nIn 20 BBY, along with [[Plo Koon]], [[Saesee Tiin]], and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia examined the corpses of Jedi Master [[Halsey]] and his [[Padawan]], [[Knox]], after [[Delta Squad]] returned them to the Jedi Temple. Gallia theorized the deaths were caused by [[Asajj Ventress]], but she knew Dooku's assassin was believed to have been [[Death|killed]] during the [[Battle of Sullust|battle]] of [[Sullust]].<ref name=\"WotM\">{{TCW|Witches of the Mist}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Lola Sayu====\n{{Quote|If the team isn't at the extraction point when you arrive, you may be forced to leave them, or put us all at risk.''\"<br />\"''I'm afraid Master Gallia is right.''\"<br />\"''They'll be there.|Adi Gallia, Saesee Tiin, and Plo Koon on their rescue mission|Citadel Rescue}}\n[[File:CitadelRescueJedi.png|thumb|left|250px|Gallia, Tiin, Koon, and Fisto discuss their rescue plan]]\nWhen the attempted rescue of Jedi Master [[Even Piell]] and Captain [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] from the Separatist [[Citadel]] on [[Lola Sayu]] went awry, Gallia was assembled as part of a rescue team to save the survivors of the initial rescue mission from being captured themselves. Gallia, Plo Koon, Saesee Tiin, and [[Kit Fisto]] met aboard one of their flagships to discuss the plan. Tiin, Gallia, and Fisto were to draw the attention of the Separatist blockade while Koon slipped onto the planet's surface with a group of gunships to pick up the survivors, among which were Kenobi, Skywalker, and Rex. Gallia noted that the plan was heavily dependent on the timing of the rescue, as if the survivors were not at the extraction point in time then Koon would have to either abandon them or put the entire mission and everyone involved as risk. Koon assured her that the survivors would be ready.<ref name=\"CR2\">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Foresight-SWZ.png|thumb|right|250px|Gallia engages CIS forces over Lola Sayu]]\nUpon arriving to Lola Sayu, Gallia, Tiin, and Fisto entered into battle in their respective interceptor ships. The battle was slow from the start, as they were unable to break through the blockade and quickly became overwhelmed by droid fighters. Koon urged Tiin to break through himself, which he agreed to do. Tiin ordered that Gallia and Fisto form up behind him, and together they managed to escort Koon's gunship and slip through the blockade. The survivors, meanwhile, had managed to reach the extraction point, but had lost Master Piell along the way. They held off Separatist forces long enough for Koon to reach them in time, and with the escort of Gallia, Tiin, and Fisto the gunship to escape from the planet's surface. Koon ordered the flagships to prepare to make their escape to Coruscant, and all Republic fighters were recalled to the cruisers. Gallia held up the rear of the gunship as they pushed through Separatist forces to reach the flagships. Once Gallia had landed and the survivors were safe, Koon had the cruisers jump into hyperspace. Gallia, along with the rescue team and the survivors of the first rescue mission, later met together at the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] to discuss the battle with Jedi [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] and Master [[Mace Windu]].<ref name=\"CR2\" />\n\n====Captured by Grievous====\n[[File:GalliaVsGrievous-ND.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gallia faces off against General Grievous]]\nShortly after Commander [[Wolffe]]'s [[Mission to Aleen|relief mission]] to the earthquake-ravaged world of [[Aleen]], he and Gallia rendezvoused their cruisers, where he unloaded the droids [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]]. Gallia's ship, headed for Republic space, neared the planet [[Patitite Pattuna]], where it came under a [[Battle of Patitite Pattuna|surprise attack]] by a fleet of Separatist ships led by Grievous. The bombardment quickly destroyed the main reactor, and Gallia ordered that the ship be evacuated. Grievous himself led a boarding party onto Gallia's ship, where she dueled with him as his forces advanced onward. Despite putting up a good fight with the general, she was ultimately defeated and captured by the cyborg. She was held captive on the bridge of his flagship, where she watched him order a random attack on a [[Marauder (Weequay pirate ship)|pirate ship]]. Gallia was not held prisoner for long, as Plo Koon and Wolffe led a rescue party to free her. Koon took charge of facing the droid soldiers as Wolffe freed Gallia from her captors. The two met in the hallways of the ship, where she thanked him for rescuing her as they finished off the remaining droids. Wolffe informed them that Grievous had once again escaped before he could have been brought into custody. Koon ordered that any remaining droids on the ship be destroyed. C-3PO and R2-D2, who had been on their own series of bizarre adventures in conjunction to Gallia's capture, had ended up on Grievous' ship. The two droids revealed themselves, and they began relaying their mishaps to an unwilling Wolffe as Gallia and Koon led the rescue party away.<ref name=\"ND2\">{{TCW|Nomad Droids}}</ref>\n\n====Mission to Bray====\n{{Quote|Did the Brayan Elders invite you to invade their world?

Upon their arrival, they were attacked by Lord [[Ravna]], who had begun to infect other inhabitants and Clone Troopers with vampyric abilities. In an attempt to stop the threat, Gallia and Kenobi traveled to the [[Citadel of Light]] on Bray, confronting Count Dooku. Though the two Jedi were briefly overpowered by Lord Ravna and Dooku, they managed to escape when Ravna attempted to betray Dooku, ending the threat and breaking the infected from their curse.<ref name=\"Tales from Vader's Castle 2\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle 2|''Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle'' 2]]</ref>\n\n====On the Nightbrothers' trail====\n[[File:KenobiGalliaInvestigate-Revival.png|thumb|left|250px|Adi Gallia and Obi-Wan Kenobi investigate Maul and Savage's attacks]]\nGallia later joined Kenobi in tracking the renegade Sith Lords Maul and [[Savage Opress]]. The [[Nightbrothers|Nightbrother]] pair had been running rampage and pillaging various Outer Rim worlds, killing Jedi [[Finn Ertay]] along the way. Gallia and Kenobi, close on the brothers' trail, responded to a distress signal from a [[Cybloc Transfer Station|space station]] in the [[Cybloc system]]. Gallia believed that the distress call could have been caused by the brothers as the station was not far from their previous attack. They met with a the station's [[Snivvian]] supervisor, who told them of [[Raid on the Cybloc Transfer Station|the recent raid]] by the brothers, who had destroyed several security droids and stolen a safe filled with credits. The supervisor questioned if the brothers were rogue Jedi and asked Kenobi to ignite his lightsaber. Upon seeing the blue blade, the supervisor stated that the [[Police droid|security droids]] had seen the brothers with red lightsabers. He told Gallia and Kenobi that the brothers had stolen a cargo ship and headed in the direction of the [[Sertar sector]]. Gallia asked Kenobi what was in the Sertar sector. He told her that the planet [[Florrum]] was located there, as were a group of pirates he had met before.<ref name=\"Revival\" />\n\nUpon arriving to Florrum, Gallia found a match on the stolen cargo ship in the space above the planet. She guessed that the Nightbrothers had sought out the pirates to unload their stolen cargo, but Kenobi believed that the pirate leader, [[Hondo Ohnaka]], would not have had an allegiance to the duo. Kenobi contacted Ohnaka on the planet below, learning that Maul and Savage had been recruiting Ohnaka's pirates to their side. Ohnaka asked that the Jedi aid him, but Kenobi assured them that he and Gallia could only deal with the Sith.<ref name=\"Revival\" />\n\n====Duel on Florrum and death====\n{{Quote|No!|Obi-Wan Kenobi upon witnessing Savage Opress kill Adi Gallia|Revival (episode)}}\n[[File:GalliaImpaled-Revival.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gallia is dealt a fatal blow by Savage Oppress]]\nMaul and Savage, now with a pirate escort, began a [[Skirmish on Florrum|raid]] on [[Hondo's Salvage|Ohnaka's stronghold]] as Gallia and Kenobi landed on a cliff nearby. The brothers quickly went to fight the Jedi upon noticing their landing. Gallia was separated from Kenobi during the duel and battled against the giant Savage Opress alone, using her agility and speed to outmaneuver him. As they fought she aimed a kick at his left knee, a move which would normally be crippling but which failed to even faze the hulking [[Zabrak]]. Caught off-guard, Gallia was slammed against the side of a wrecked ship with the Force and then gored through the stomach with Savage's horns, mortally wounding her before Savage dealt the final blow with his lightsaber. Her murder was witnessed by Kenobi, who attacked Savage in a rage but was forced to retreat as the two brothers ganged up on him, though not before recovering Gallia's lightsaber. Kenobi escaped into Ohnaka's fortress with the pirate's remaining forces, and the two devised a plan to separate the Nightbrothers from their new allies. Obi-Wan drew the brothers away from Ohnaka and proceeded to duel them wielding Gallia's lightsaber in conjunction with his own. After a bout of aggressive swordplay and physical blows to the same knee Gallia had struck earlier before her death, Obi-Wan managed to sever Savage's left arm with Gallia's lightsaber, forcing the brothers to flee as Ohnaka and his now-reunited forces began a counterattack against the retreating Sith, who barely managed to survive.<ref name=\"Revival\" />\n\n===Legacy ===\n{{Quote|Rise, Rey...|Gallia speaks to Rey|Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker}}\nShortly after the [[Battle of Fortress Vader]], Vader entered a [[portal]] constructed by [[Darth Momin]] to resurrect his wife [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].
