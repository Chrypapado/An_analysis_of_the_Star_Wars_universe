In [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Hedji joined the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]], a ragtag team of warriors formed by [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] to defend the [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduban]] village of [[Onacra]] from the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]], a gang of marauders under the command of [[Serji-X Arrogantus]]. Stoic and humorless, Hedji stipulated to Solo that his reasons for joining the team would remain unquestioned&mdash;in truth, the Spiner held to a rigid moral code.\n\nHe journeyed with Solo and the rest of the Star-Hoppers to Onacra, where they did [[Battle of Aduba-3|battle]] with the Cloud-Riders. Hedji put his naturally grown [[Quill/Legends|quills]] to good use, using them to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the opponents. Although Arrogantus was overcome during the engagement, a giant monster&mdash;the [[Behemoth from the World Below|Behemoth from Below]]&mdash;emerged and wreaked havoc. When one Star-Hopper, faux-[[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Don-Wan Kihotay]], attempted to confront the monster by himself, Hedji rushed to his aid. The Spiner was consequently killed by a lightning blast from the creature.\n\n==Biography==\n===A dying breed===\n{{Quote|Quills! I didn't know there were any of you spiners left in the galaxy. Anyway&hellip; You're hired!|Han Solo to Hedji|Star Wars (1977) 8}}\nHedji was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] member of the [[Spiner]] [[Species/Legends|species]]&mdash;rare in [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] during the [[Imperial Period]], due to the fact that their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], [[Worxer|Yablon]], had been destroyed by a [[Supernova/Legends|supernova]]. The [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] had only managed to rescue roughly a thousand of the [[Species/Legends|species]], as they themselves had not developed [[Realspace/Legends|space]] travel. Furthermore, the Spiners could only [[Reproduction/Legends|reproduce]] on Yablon, and so they were gradually driven toward extinction. Hedji eventually made his way to the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]] world of [[Aduba-3/Legends|Aduba-3]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n[[File:Hedji.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hedji meets Han Solo.]]\nWhile in the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] of [[Tun Aduban]] in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]], Hedji heard word that a posse was being formed for an unknown purpose. The Spiner made his way to [[Locru's Central Saloon]], where candidates for the group were being interviewed by the [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]]. After ten candidates had been rejected, Hedji entered Solo's room. Solo noted that he was unarmed, and the Spiner insisted that he did not need a weapon. When the Corellian asked him to leave, Hedji stayed put, and demonstrated his natural [[Quill/Legends|quill]]-throwing ability. Solo, shocked, immediately identified Hedji as a Spiner. Impressed, he hired Hedji, who inquired as to just what they were being hired to do. The Corellian assured him that he would be informed as soon as he had recruited a large enough force.<ref name=\"m8\" />\n\nThe next day, Hedji met with the rest of the posse&mdash;Solo's [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] co-pilot [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], fugitive [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] [[Amaiza Foxtrain/Legends|Amaiza Foxtrain]], elderly faux-[[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Don-Wan Kihotay]], [[Lepi/Legends|Lepi]] [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] [[Jaxxon]], as well as the young [[Jimm Doshun|Jimm \"The Starkiller Kid\" Doshun]], and the [[Tracked labor droid|tractor droid]] [[FE-9Q]]. As they assembled and Solo prepared to brief them, they were approached by [[Serji-X Arrogantus]] and the [[Cloud-Riders/Legends|Cloud-Riders]]&mdash;a group of [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] from whom Solo had gathered a fighting force to defend the farming village of [[Onacra]]. Solo and Arrogantus exchanged heated words before the Cloud-Riders departed.<ref name=\"m8\" /> Hedji was focused on dedicating himself to the defense of the weak and harmless, but he kept his intent secret from the other members of the gang.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nThe group saddled up on [[Bantha/Legends|banthas]] and made their way out to Onacra. As they got closer to the village, they encountered a pack of [[high-hound]]s ravaging the [[Farm/Legends|farmers]]' crops, and Solo ordered his forces to engage the creatures. Hedji put his quills to good use, killing one of the beasts with a precise fusillade of strikes. The group later arrived at the village and were introduced to the local farmers. Solo ordered everyone to prepare makeshift defenses for the village, but soon enough Arrogantus and the Cloud-Riders were sighted on approach. Hedji and the rest of the defenders assembled, and the Spiner assured Solo that he was ready to engage the enemy when the order was given. As the defenders fought the Cloud-Riders, Hedji teamed up with Jaxxon, rapidly launching quills toward his opponents.<ref name=\"m9\">[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars 9: Showdown on a Wasteland World'']]</ref>\n\n===The Behemoth===\n{{Quote|The Behemoth ''doesn't give up'', does it?!|Hedji|Star Wars (1977) 10}}\nThe climate of the [[Battle of Aduba-3|battle]] was complicated when one of the villagers, known as the [[Old One]], summoned a gargantuan [[Monster|beast]], the [[Behemoth from the World Below]], to battle the Cloud-Riders. When the creature began launching concentrated bursts of lightning from its forehead, Hedji pointed out to Solo the threat it posed. At first, the Corellian believed the creature was merely attacking the Cloud-Riders, but when a boulder came hurtling toward the regrouped posse, they were forced to scatter and seek out better cover. The beast eventually trampled both Arrogantus and the Old One. Hedji was querulous as to how the group should proceed, and Doshun pointed out that Onacra would be in danger now that the only one who could control the behemoth was dead.<ref name=\"m10\">[[Star Wars (1977) 10|''Star Wars'' (1977) 10]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Morejaxxon.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Hedji and Jaxxon do battle with the forces of Serji-X Arrogantus.]]\nAfter a foolhardy attempt made by Jaxxon to singlehandedly destroy the beast, Solo ordered his allies to work as a team. As they were plotting, a second landslide caused by the beast forced them to relocate once more. The team soon noticed that Kihotay was making his own singular attempt to destroy the creature, approaching it with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] drawn. The fighters looked on anxiously, and Solo noted that the behemoth reacted strangely to the lightsaber. While Solo and the others held back, Hedji set off to help the beleaguered old man, who had drawn the monster's fire. Despite Solo's protests, the Spiner made his way into the open, and urged Kihotay to retreat, as he was not agile enough to dodge the blasts of the creature. Kihotay, however, was adamant that it was his duty to slay the gargantuan beast.<ref name=\"m10\" />\n\nRealizing that he could no longer reason with the old man, Hedji fired off a fusillade of fresh quills at the behemoth. The attack, however, did nothing but anger the creature, and it turned its lightning projections on Hedji.<ref name=\"m10\" /> The Spiner was instantly struck dead.<ref name=\"g4\" /> Solo was eventually able to destroy the beast with Kihotay's lightsaber.<ref name=\"m10\" /> The exploits of the group, which would come to be known as the [[Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]], were later immortalized in a historically dubious [[holodocumentary]] created by the [[Tri-Nebula Entertainment]] company. Hedji himself would later be profiled by [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] [[Historian/Legends|historian]] [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]], who was attempting to compile a more accurate history of the Star-Hoppers' exploits than the holodocumentary's portrayal for the Alliance database known as [[Mistress Mnemos]].<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I'm no ''amateur'', Han Solo!|Hedji|Star Wars (1977) 9}}\nHedji was a laconic individual, and he clung to a rigid code of honor. He was both quiet and stoic, and preferred to keep company with himself. He had little [[Time/Legends|time]] for technology that made physical activity simple. While he had use for [[Starship/Legends|starships]] and medical technologies that were necessities, the Spiner had no time whatsoever for items of convenience or comfort. He refused to carry a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and placed his trust in his natural quill-throwing abilities. He held strong convictions about the defense of those weaker than him, but he refused to divulge any personal details to his fellow Star-Hoppers.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\nHedji was considered by Solo to be one of the more competent Star-Hoppers, and Hedji made sure that the Corellian was aware he was a complete professional in the art of combat.<ref name=\"m9\" /> Later, when Don-Wan Kihotay sacrificed his safety to attempt to battle the Aduban behemoth by himself, Hedji could no longer stand aside and was driven into action, sacrificing himself to save the elderly faux-Jedi. In his last moments, Hedji came to suppose that Kihotay may have indeed been a Jedi Knight of the old [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. He also felt that Captain Solo should have done more than merely stand and watch as the elderly Kihotay sacrificed himself for his allies. Hedji possessed dark [[Color/Legends|gray]] [[Hair/Legends|fur]] and black [[Eye/Legends|eyes]].<ref name=\"m10\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|I kinda hoped you'd be different&hellip; But I don't even see your gun.''\"<br />\"''My name is Hedji&hellip; And I never use one.|Han Solo and Hedji|Star Wars (1977) 8}}\n[[File:Zikzikzik.jpg|thumb|right|280px|As a Spiner, Hedji could fire his quills at opponents.]]\nAs a Spiner, Hedji was covered in stiff, barbed quills, which grew longest on his [[Limb/Legends|arms]] and legs. He could flex his muscles in a specific way, and the quills would be propelled with great speed and accuracy to any target up to ten [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] away. He naturally replenished the quills whenever more were needed. He donned an all-temperature cloak to serve as his attire.<ref name=\"g4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHedji first appeared in the [[Star Wars (1977)|Marvel]] [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] [[Star Wars (1977) 8|''Star Wars'' (1977) 8]] ([[1978]]), written by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Howard Chaykin]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 8|''Star Wars'' (1977) 8]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 9|''Star Wars'' (1977) 9]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 10|''Star Wars'' (1977) 10]]\n*[[Star Wars (1977) 11|''Star Wars'' (1977) 11]] {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{GalaxyCite|3|ComicScan|ComicScan: Marvelously Silly Aliens}}\n*{{GamerCite|4|The Starhoppers of Aduba-3}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SW|url=news/so-uncivilized-great-gunslingers-in-star-wars-part-1|text=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in ''Star Wars'', Part 1|int=So Uncivilized: Great Gunslingers in Star Wars}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Hedji\n|es=Hedji\n}}\n\n[[Category:Adubans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Spiners]]\n[[Category:Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3]]"}}}]}}}}
