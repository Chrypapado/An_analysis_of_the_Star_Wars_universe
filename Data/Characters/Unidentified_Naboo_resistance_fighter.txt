This [[Naboo Underground|resistance]] fighter joined in the fight. When Naboo's [[Queen/Legends|Queen]], [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Amidala]] returned to the planet after her exile, she rounded up all the surviving [[Officer/Legends|officers]] to plan the [[Battle of Naboo/Legends|end of the war]]. The [[Gungan Grand Army/Legends|Gungan Grand Army]] would draw out the main part of the [[Trade Federation Droid Army/Legends|Trade Federation Droid Army]] while the Queen led a ground assault of the capital [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Theed/Legends|Theed]] to capture the [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]]. This resistance fighter was stationed at a [[resistance outpost]] on the [[Great Grass Plains/Legends|Great Grass Plains]]. The Trade Federation sent the Army B to flank the Plains and attack the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungans]],<ref>''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> but the [[Army/Legends|army]] engaged the outpost instead. The resistance fighter ordered her outpost to get ready to fight. Two [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] allies of the Security Forces, [[Nym/Legends|Nym]] and [[Vana Sage]] were on hand to protect the outpost. The resistance fighter kept up a running commentary while the two spacers engaged Army B. The base was being overrun when [[Rhys Dallows|two]] [[Reti|more]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] showed up to protect the base. The combined firepower drove off the attacking vehicles and [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]]. The resistance fighter then thanked the pilots as they flew off.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Battle for Naboo\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThis resistance fighter appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Starfighter]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Starfighter]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' {{C|Battle of Grassy Plains entry}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Naboo]]\n[[Category:Naboo Underground]]\n[[Category:Unidentified females]]\n[[Category:Unidentified rebels and resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
