He gives me new name, new job. He makes me Morsel the Administrator!|Morsel|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\n'''Morsel''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Evocii]] who lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Sith Empire (Post\u2013Great Hyperspace War)|Sith Empire]]. Whilst on Hutta, he lived in the planet's swamps along with many other Evocii, but was selected by a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] named [[Suudaa Nem'ro]] to work for him in an administrative role at an Evocii work camp in the village of [[Voam]], giving him the name ''Morsel''. The Evocii at the work camp were kept in line by several non-Evocii enforcers working for Nem'ro. These men mocked Morsel and refused to follow his orders, making his job particularly difficult. Morsel then began seeking aid to help him intimidate the men so that they would listen to him. He found an Imperial-aligned individual in [[Nem'ro's Palace]] who was willing to help him and offered them a large amount of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to scare the camp's [[Unidentified chief enforcer|chief enforcer]]. The individual obliged and warned the enforcer he would face Nem'ro's wrath if he continued to ignore Morsel. The enforcer, successfully intimidated, promised to obey Morsel. Happy with the individual's work, the Evocii paid them the agreed amount of credits.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Nem'ro orders me to keep work camp enforcers in line, but they hired to bully Evocii--they laugh at me!|Morsel|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nMorsel was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Evocii]] who was alive during the [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]]. Morsel lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]],<ref name=\"Lean\" /> which had originally been controlled by his [[Species/Legends|species]], but had been adopted by the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] species as their [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] after the destruction of the planet [[Varl/Legends|Varl]].<ref name=\"CodexHutta\">{{TORcite|type=codex|Hutta}}</ref> Morsel lived in the swamps on Nal Hutta, near an industrial town named [[Jiguuna]], as did many of his species.<ref name=\"Lean\" /> The self-declared ruler of the town,<ref name=\"CodexJiguuna\">{{TORcite|type=codex|Jiguuna}}</ref> a Hutt [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] named [[Suudaa Nem'ro]], made him an administrator of an Evocii work camp in the swamps, and giving him the name ''Morsel'', complete with ceremony. Once Morsel began attempting to perform his duties, however, he discovered that the human enforcers who kept the Evocii workers in line mocked him, making fun of his name and ignoring his orders. Morsel began seeking help within the cantina of [[Nem'ro's Palace]], offering [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to any who would aid him.<ref name=\"Lean\" />\n\n{{GameDSmechanics}}\nMorsel found an Imperial-aligned individual willing to aid him. He asked the individual to travel to the camp and intimidate the [[Unidentified chief enforcer|chief enforcer]] there so that the enforcers would obey him, offering a large amount of credits if they did. The individual visited the enforcer and warned him that Nem'ro would be displeased if they didn't do as Morsel asked and they would kill the enforcer if they had to return. This scared the enforcer enough that he promised to obey the Evocii. Morsel was thankful, and paid the individual 30 credits and a minor [[Medpac/Legends|medpac]].<ref name=\"Lean\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Go to work camp. Wave your gun in chief enforcer's face. Make him see Morsel no one to laugh at, and I have stack of credits for you.|Morsel|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nMorsel was grateful to Nem'ro for giving him a job as administrator and removing him from the swamps of Nal Hutta. When the enforcers prevented Morsel from completing the work Nem'ro had set for him, he became worried and was willing to pay well to correct the situation. Morsel had no moral objections to intimidation, but he did not feel himself capable of intimidating the enforcers himself. He wore [[Color/Legends|brown]] clothing whilst serving in Nem'ro's palace and had blue [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], pale yellow skin and black hair which he wore several beads in.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|No need to say a thing. I got a very polite holo from the chief enforcer. Very polite. And here, my good mercenary, are your credits.|Morsel's dialogue if the player chooses the \"light side\" option and returns to him.|Star Wars: The Old Republic}}\nMorsel first appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', released in [[2011]] by [[BioWare]]. In the game, he appears on the planet Nal Hutta, where he is involved in the mission \"A Slight Lean\", in which he asks the player to intimidate an enforcer for him. Players may choose to threaten to kill the enforcer as a \"[[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]\" option or be more diplomatic with the enforcer as a \"[[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]]\" option. Both result in the enforcer agreeing to cease his taunting. This article assumes the player threatened to kill the enforcer, as only players of the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|Bounty Hunter]] or [[Imperial Agent]] classes, both assumed to always choose \"dark side\" options, can take on the missions.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0437\u0435\u043b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Evocii]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]\n[[Category:Servants]]"}}}]}}}}
