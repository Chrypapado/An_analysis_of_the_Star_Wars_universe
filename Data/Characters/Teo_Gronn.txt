[[Jedi Initiate Trials|Graduating]] from the [[Jedi academy|Temple's academy]] after just over a decade of study, Gronn was chosen to become the [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Lyron]], a fellow Duros. Accompanying Lyron on a few missions, their fellowship was short-lived as Master Lyron participated and died in the [[First Battle of Geonosis/Legends|opening battle]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], a conflict between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name=\"OTF\" />\n\nStationed at the Temple, an orphaned Gronn was quickly reassigned to Master [[Oshi-Jid]] and was appointed the rank of [[Jedi Commander/Legends|Commander]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]]. Gronn was again quickly robbed of his teacher when Oshi-Jid perished during the [[Battle of Muunilinst/Legends|fighting]] on [[Muunilinst/Legends|Muunilinst]], sending him back to the Temple to await reassignment. With no available masters, the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] was forced to send Gronn on a mission with other Padawans whose masters had been killed. Led by [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] and Master [[Ulseh]], Gronn fought in the [[Battle of Argul|battle]] of [[Argul]] alongside his fellow Padawans. While Ulseh was killed and Yoda retreated for reinforcements, Gronn and the other apprentices held off Confederate [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Drogen Hosh]] long enough for the Grand Master to return, turning the battle into a victory for the Republic.<ref name=\"OTF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTeo Gronn made his only appearance in ''[[Only the Force]]'', a scenario for the [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]. In that, the player playing as Gronn can choose Gronn's sex. However, he is described as male in the biographies of the other playable characters, so that can be assumed to be his canonical sex.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Only the Force]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Gronn,Teo}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Duros]]\n[[Category:Jedi Commanders]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
