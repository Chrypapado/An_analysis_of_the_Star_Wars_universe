I already have a love. And it's called money.|Unkar Plutt|True Love}}\n'''Unkar Plutt''', a [[Gender|male]] member of the [[Crolute]] [[species]], resided on the remote, lawless world of [[Jakku]] approximately 30 [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]]. The Crolute was a [[junk boss]] who bought weapons, gears and scraps of Rebel and Imperial ships which had crashed during the [[Battle of Jakku]]. The ruthless Unkar used hired [[Unkar's thugs|thugs]] to enforce his stranglehold on barter, sending them to punish any [[scavenger]] who dared dabble in unauthorized trades or negotiated too aggressively. '''The Blobfish'''&mdash;as scavengers called him behind his broad back&mdash;had collected all manner of weapons, gears, and ships over the years, including a battered [[Millennium Falcon|Corellian freighter]] he kept under a tarp on the outskirts of [[Niima Outpost]]. From his [[Concession Stand]] in Niima Outpost, he ruled over the lives of the scavengers, buying and selling scrap and doling out survival rations.\n\n==Biography==\n===Birth===\nUnkar Plutt was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[Water|aquatic]] world of [[Crul]]<ref name=\"True Love\" /> in [[16 BBY]].<ref name=\"TFA Script\" /> [[Gender|He]] claimed to have left after a business deal fell through, then drifted from place to place until eventually ending up on [[Jakku]].<ref name=\"True Love\" />\n\n===Early dealings===\n[[File:Garbagell_Do_SoR.png|thumb|left|250px|The ''Millennium Falcon'' in Plutt's junkyard outside Niima Outpost.]]\nUnkar Plutt established himself on Jakku sometime after the [[Battle of Jakku]], making a living trading salvage for [[Foodstuff|food]] rations to local [[scavenger]]s and reselling the parts to [[spacer]]s that wanted to buy parts off-the-books. In [[21 ABY|21 ABY,]] a [[youngling]] who called herself [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] was left with him on Jakku<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> by [[Rey's father|her]] [[Rey's mother|parents]] in order to protect her from her grandfather [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Sith Lord]] who [[Galactic Emperor|ruled]] the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"Episode IX\">[[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']]</ref> Rey worked for Unkar directly until she began coordinating with other scavengers. The young teen eventually struck out on her own, becoming one of the best scavengers on Jakku. Because of that, Unkar's thugs had orders to make sure she was left alone.<ref name=\"Rey's Survival Guide\">''[[Rey's Survival Guide]]''</ref>\n\nOn one occasion, when Rey was [[28 ABY|thirteen years old]],<ref name=\"TRoKR Date\">''[[The Star Wars Book]]'' dates the [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destruction]] of the [[Jedi Temple of Luke Skywalker]] to 28 [[Standard year|years]] after the events of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. Since ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' establishes that ''A New Hope'' begins in [[0 BBY]], the temple's destruction must have taken place in [[28 ABY]]. The events of [[The Rise of Kylo Ren 4|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 4]] are set sometime after the temple's destruction in [[The Rise of Kylo Ren 1|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 1]], meaning that the events of the [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] take place around [[28 ABY]].</ref> the young scavenger asked Unkar if he felt cold, something which Plutt hadn't. Unknown to both of them, Rey had experienced a [[Force-bond]] with [[Ben Solo]], who was fighting against [[Ren]] on the [[moon]] of [[Minemoon]].<ref name=\"TRoKR 4\">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 4|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 4]]</ref>\n\nAt some point in his career, Unkar stole a [[YT-1300 light freighter]] from the [[Irving Boys]], which turned out to be the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> He discovered the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'' in the ''Falcon'' and made notes how the ''Falcon'' didn't look like much and that he could only make some money if [[navigation computer]] and [[engine]]s were pushed. If no one made an offer, the ship would have been stripped for parts.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref> Over Rey's objections, Unkar installed a [[compressor]] and primer in the [[Starship|ship's]] systems. The ship would sit in Unkar's yard for years under a tarp.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Aside the compressor, like all previous owners of the ''Falcon'', Plutt made some other unadvised modifications to the ship, which wouldn't be removed until many years later.<ref name=\"lastjedinovel\">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> Plutt also organized a failed mission to collect valuables from [[Carbon Ridge]], rumored to house a hidden [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] base. Stung by the failure, Plutt never talked about it again.<ref name=\"Rey's Survival Guide\" /> Plutt arranged for a shuttle depositing credits with an offworld banking service to be robbed, crippling the small minority of scavengers who chose to sell their scrap to offworlders for currency instead of going to him.<ref name=\"True Love\" />\n\n[[File:True_Love_cover_art.png|thumb|right|250px|Plutt during the event around the banking shuttle robbery]]\nAbout 30 years after the Battle of Endor, Unkar had bought out or driven out his competition in Niima Outpost, creating a monopoly for his business.<ref name=\"awakensjunior\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Even the Constabulary answered to him. Unkar had total control over [[Niima Outpost]].<ref name=\"Rey's Survival Guide\" /> He controlled the most [[water]], and the most wealth, of anyone on Jakku.<ref name=\"True Love\" />\n\n===Junk boss of Jakku===\n{{Quote|The Blobfish sits behind his barred window all day, examining junk, muttering to himself,  and yelling at his goons as if he's afraid that we scavengers would tear him apart if he set one blobby foot outside.|Rey about Unkar Plutt|Rey's Survival Guide}}\n[[File:Unbar_Plutt_TFA.png|thumb|left|250px|Unkar Plutt, junk boss of Jakku.]]\nAs Niima Outpost's only [[junk boss]], Unkar spent most of his time doling [[ration pack]]s to scavengers from his stall in the [[Concession Stand]] in exchange for their salvage.<ref name=\"awakensvisual\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> He almost never left the stand, because the harsh environment of Jakku disagreed with his aquatic nature. It was widely believed that most of his resources were stored in the stand, although some suspected the real wealth was hidden elsewhere.<ref name=\"True Love\" />\n\nSometime before the [[attack on Tuanul]], Plutt was [[Kidnapping of Unkar Plutt|kidnapped]] by [[Zool Zendiat]] and his gang, who were searching for a [[J9 worker drone|J9]] droid which had been sold to Plutt.<ref name=\"Devil 1\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=1|story=[[Better the Devil You Know, Part I]]}}</ref>\n\nAt some point, two of Plutt's minions attempted to acquire info from him using a [[Tanandra Frullich|sophisticated AI]]. Plutt captured them and took the AI for himself as an assistant, although he often threatened to delete it.<ref name=\"True Love\" />\n\nOne day, Rey came to sell salvage accompanied by a [[BB-8|droid]], one that Unkar recognized as being one wanted by the [[First Order]].<ref name=\"awakensnovel\" /> He offered to buy the droid for 60 portions, but Rey refused. Again, he bargained the droid for 100 portions, but to no avail. Refusing to take no for an answer, Unkar dispatched two of his [[Unkar's thugs|thugs]] to steal the droid. However, Rey easily subdued them.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" />\n\nUnkar didn't have a chance to form another plan to steal Rey's droid, since almost immediately after Rey defeated his thugs, the First Order began [[Escape from Jakku|attacking]] on Niima Outpost. In the commotion of the [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] and [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE fighters]], Unkar watched as Rey, the droid, and a defecting stormtrooper named [[Finn]] hijacked the ''Millennium Falcon'' from his yard. His screams that the ship was his were ignored.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> At the same time, Plutt lost the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'' that would be later recovered by [[Han Solo]].<ref name=\"Smuggler's Guide\" />\n\n===Confrontation on Takodana===\n{{Quote|I'm gonna make you and that worrisome droid pay for what you've done.|Unkar Plutt, to Rey|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}\n[[File:Young_Rey_with_Unkar_Plutt.png|thumb|right|250px|A young Rey clutched by Unkar Plutt in Rey's vision.]]\nUnwilling to lose the ''Millennium Falcon'', Unkar and his thugs trailed the ship to [[Takodana Castle]]. There, he assaulted Rey physically, wanting the ship back and revenge on his former scavenger and the droid for the misery they caused him. Rey attempted to fight back, but neglected to remove the [[safety]] on her [[blaster]]. The commotion, however, caught the attention of the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], one of Rey's new friends, who had recovered the ''Falcon'' along with [[Han Solo]] shortly after Rey and Finn's departure from Jakku. When Chewbacca indicated that he would fight him if he did not release Rey, Plutt laughed it off, wondering what a lone Wookiee could do against him and his thugs, for which reason he started to touch repeatedly the Wookiee's injured arm. Furious, Chewbacca demonstrated succinctly why it wasn't wise to upset a Wookiee by ripping off one of Plutt's arms, which landed in a near table at the castle.<ref name=\"awakensnovel\" />\n\nLater, when experiencing her [[Force vision]] in the basement of [[Maz Kanata]]'s castle after touching the [[Skywalker lightsaber|Skywalker's lightsaber]], Rey saw her childhood self being left in Unkar's charge for the first time.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> [[35 ABY|A year later]], at the insistence of Kylo Ren, Rey experienced the same vision upon realizing that her parents didn't abandon her for drinking money but instead to protect her.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nA hulking [[Crolute]], Unkar Plutt was the ruthless junk [[boss]] of Jakku, often using hired muscle to enforce his stranglehold on barter and sending his thugs to punish any scavenger who dared dabble in unauthorized trades or negotiated too aggressively. This attitude eventually earned him the nickname of \"The Blobfish\" by many scavengers behind his broad back.<ref name=\"Unkar Plutt\" />\n\nDespite his attitude, Unkar used to be somewhat polite when doing business sometimes, especially with Rey, calling her \"My Girl\" or \"Sweetheart\" when dealing with her, like when he negotiated with her the possibility of selling BB-8, though she ultimately refused. He didn't like, however, to have scavengers disputing the value of their finds.<ref name=\"awakensnovel\" />\n\nUnkar also was not used to taking orders or respecting anyone, a trait that was demonstrated when he ignored the Wookiee Chewbacca's warning about not harming Rey, taking advantage of the injured shoulder of Rey's friend, touching repeatedly the bandage that covered the Wookiee's wound. This, however, cost Unkar one of his arms, as the Wookiee ripped it off for his insolence.<ref name=\"awakensnovel\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nUnkar Plutt wore a metal apron with yellow patterning.<ref name=\"VE\">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nUnkar Plutt was portrayed by [[Simon Pegg]] in [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]. Pegg is a frequent collaborator with director [[J.J. Abrams]] and his production company, [[Bad Robot Productions]], having also appeared as [[Wikipedia:Benji Dunn|Benji Dunn]] in Abrams's ''Mission: Impossible'' trilogy and [[MemoryAlpha:Montgomery Scott (alternate reality)|Scotty]] in his ''Star Trek'' films. Plutt is Pegg's second ''Star Wars'' role; he had previously provided the voice of [[Dengar]] in two episodes of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. Pegg was also initially announced to be reprising his role as Unkar in [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']],<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/ready-player-one/253869/simon-pegg-negotiating-to-join-ready-player-one-adaptation-by-steven-spielberg|title=Simon Pegg Negotiating to Join Ready Player One Adaptation by Steven Spielberg|work=[http://www.denofgeek.com Den of Geek!]|archivedate=20170130045327}}</ref> but neither he nor his character were featured in the finished version of the film, though Unkar still got a mention in [[Jason Fry]]'s [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition|novelization]] for the film.\n\nIn the animated microseries ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]'' and the non-canon video game ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', Unkar Plutt is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n\nIn the film's [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|novelization]], Rey refuses Plutt's offer to purchase BB-8, instead bargaining upward before finally accepting a much higher offer. She then, however, changes her mind. When Plutt gets upset, she puts him in his place, earning the respect of many other individuals at the Niima Outpost, but likely burning her bridges with him for good. This likely plays a large part in the confrontation with him at Maz Kanata's castle that later occurs in the novelization. The novelization also describes in detail Rey's general disgust with Plutt and his operation.<ref name=\"awakensnovel\" /> In the [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel|junior novelization]], Rey bargains up to 100 portions, which is quickly accepted. However, when Plutt tells her \"''That's my girl'',\" she changes her mind and tells him that \"''conditions have changed'',\" feeling that turnabout is fair play, given the number of times he's changed deals on her. He tells her that she's nothing, but she ignores him and walks away, earning glances of respect from many of the others in Niima Outpost.<ref name=\"awakensjunior\" /> A scene in which Chewbacca rips off Plutt's arm was filmed for ''The Force Awakens'', but ultimately deleted from the final cut. This scene was included in the film's novelization.<ref name=\"ewdeleted\">{{Cite_web|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/10/18/star-wars-force-awakens-deleted-scene-unkar-plutt-chewbacca|title=''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' deleted scene: Unkar Plutt enrages Chewbacca|author=Breznican, Anthony|date=2016-10-18|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|archivedate=20200817025134}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scroll_box|\n*[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 4|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 4]]\n*''[[Forces of Destiny: Daring Adventures: Volume 1]]'' {{Mo}}\n*{{Shortstory|story=True Love|book=Tales from a Galaxy Far, Far Away: Aliens: Volume I}}\n*''[[Before the Awakening]]''\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=1|story=[[Better the Devil You Know, Part I]]}}\n*{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=2|story=[[Better the Devil You Know, Part II]]}}\n*{{FOD|The Happabore Hazard}}\n*''[[Forces of Destiny: The Rey Chronicles]]''\n*''[[Choose Your Destiny: A Scavenger Mission]]''\n*{{Shortstory|story=Destroyer Down|book=Star Wars Adventures: Destroyer Down}}\n*''[[Force Collector]]''\n*[[Force Collector (audiobook)|''Force Collector'' audiobook]]\n*[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (audiobook)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''\n*[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel (audiobook)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Force Awakens: Rey's Story]]''\n*[[The Force Awakens: Rey's Story (audiobook)|''The Force Awakens: Rey's Story'' audiobook]]\n*''[[The Force Awakens: Finn's Story]]''\n*''[[Rey Meets BB-8]]''\n*''[[Finn & Rey Escape!]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Graphic Novel Adaptation]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[The Force Awakens Adaptation 1|''The Force Awakens Adaptation'' 1]]\n*[[The Force Awakens Adaptation 2|''The Force Awakens Adaptation'' 2]]\n*[[The Force Awakens Adaptation 3|''The Force Awakens Adaptation'' 3]] {{Mo}}\n*[[The Force Awakens Adaptation 4|''The Force Awakens Adaptation'' 4]] {{Vision|Rey}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny\u2014Rey]]''\n*{{FOD|Tracker Trouble}} {{Mo}}\n*[[Age of Resistance -
