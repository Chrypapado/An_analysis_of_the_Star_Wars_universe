The one you recognize is a ''traitor'' and a Separatist minion.|[[Saw Gerrera]]|A War on Two Fronts}}\n'''Sanjay Rash''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Monarchy|monarch]] who ruled as [[King]] of [[Onderon]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. After taking the [[throne]] from his predecessor, King [[Ramsis Dendup]], Rash gained the [[Separatist Droid Army|military support]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. However, a [[Onderon rebels|band of rebels]] opposed the Separatist occupation of their [[Homeworld|home]] [[planet]] and supported Dendup's claim against Rash. With the help of the [[Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic]], [[Steela Gerrera]]'s insurgents fought a [[Onderonian Civil War|successful campaign]] to drive the [[battle droid]] [[army]] off of Onderon. During the evacuation, Rash was [[Death|executed]] by [[General]] [[Kalani]] on [[Count]] [[Dooku]]'s orders. As a result, Dendup regained control of the [[Royal Court of Onderon|royal government]].\n\n==Biography==\nWhen the [[Clone Wars]] began, [[King]] [[Ramsis Dendup]] was forced to either join up with the [[Galactic Republic]] or the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. In the end [[Gender|he]] chose neither, so the Separatists invaded the [[capital]] of Onderon, [[Iziz]], against the king's will. With the CIS in control, Sanjay Rash was chosen to be the successor of the old king, but not as a true king, but as a puppet of [[Dooku]] to keep an eye on the [[planet]]. With Sanjay Rash now in control, Dendup was [[Prison|imprisoned]] in the palace's garden.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\nHowever, a small band of [[Onderon rebels|rebels]] started [[Onderonian Civil War|fighting]] against the [[droid]]s and Sanjay's rule and were forced to retreat into the [[jungle]]s. There, they contacted the [[Jedi High Council]] and the Republic for help. The Council sent the [[Jedi]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Ahsoka Tano]] as well as [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]] to train the rebels. Once the Jedi made their way to the planet, they were led to their outpost in the jungle. With captured Separatist [[battle droid]]s and munitions, the Jedi trained the rebels how to disable [[Armored Assault Tank Mk I|tanks]] and [[droideka]]s with [[grenade]]s as well as target practice.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\nMeanwhile in the [[city]], [[probe droid]]s were sent to investigate the site after the Republic [[Starship|ship]] that brought the Jedi to the planet failed to register. The droids discovered the base of the rebels and a [[battalion]] was sent to eradicate them. After a short battle the rebels were able to take down the battle droids and were ready to head inside the capital.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\nOnce in the city, the rebels began small strikes against the droid patrols. The news eventually came to the ears of the false-king Rash, who ordered Dendup to call off the attacks, thinking he was the one behind them, even though he had no access to the outside. Dendup suggested that he could only stop the attacks by ending the droid occupation.<ref name=\"Front Runners\">{{TCW|Front Runners}}</ref>\n\nThe same night the rebels made an attack on the city's power generator, disabling it for good. Without power, the droids were unable to recharge and would eventually be disabled one by one. With the darkness as their cover, the rebels were able to ambush battle droid patrols with ease. The rebels' actions made Rash even more distraught, and he demanded better [[troop]]s from [[Count]] Dooku. The count, although displeased for the king's ability to not take care of the rebels, agreed to send more reinforcements, and also send a [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]] named [[Kalani]] to succeed where the king had failed.<ref name=\"Front Runners\" />\n\nSome time later the Onderon rebels continued their strikes against the droids in the city and sent a message to the people of Onderon. Back in the palace, [[General]] [[Akenathen Tandin]] identified [[Steela Gerrera|Steela]] and [[Saw Gerrera]] as well as [[Lux Bonteri]] as the key members of the rebels. General Tandin suggested that the [[Royal Onderon Militia]] be allowed to handle the rebels, but Kalani refused, suspecting that the militia could have rebel sympathizers among them. Rash was getting more and more frustrated, and called Dendup again to his throne and ordered his predecessor to stop the attacks. Once again, Dendup denied that he had no part in the rebels' doings and said it was the will of the people that justified their actions. The King was done with the [[terrorist]]'s acts and ordered Dendup's [[Death|execution]] the next [[Standard day|day]], hoping it would break the rebels' moral and stop the attacks.<ref name=\"Front Runners\" />\n\nThat night, Saw Gerrera tried to free the former king, but was captured and now taken part of the execution. However, before the executions began, the rebels attempted to rescue Dendup, knocking out King Rash in the process, but failed as droid reinforcements arrived. Because of this, they all joined the execution, but before they could proceed any further, General Tandin betrayed the Separatist King and joined the rebels, along with the royal guard. With Tandin holding Rash as hostage while the others escaped, Ahsoka Tano jumped out of the crowd and knocked the droids down and escaped to the rebels' secret hideout. Rash's droids attempted to pursue them, but were stopped as the crowd stopped them, now sided with the rebels.<ref name=\"The Soft War\">{{TCW|The Soft War}}</ref>\n\nNow that the king was free and General Tandin had joined the fight, the rebels prepared the final part of the battle. They set up a base in the [[mountain]]s located to the east from Iziz. Rash and Kalani sent a [[Separatist Droid Army|massive army]] along with new [[HMP droid gunship]]s to eradicate the rebels. At first the new [[gunship]]s seemed indestructible, but Anakin Skywalker managed to buy an effective few [[RPS-6 rocket launcher|rocket launchers]] from [[Hondo Ohnaka]] per Ahsoka Tano's request. The rebels were able to destroy the gunships and win the battle, but at the cost of losing Steela Gerrera.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\n[[File:King_Rash_Tipping_Points_Execution.png|thumb|250px|Kalani executed King Rash.]]\nBack at Iziz, King Rash was desperate and demanded more troops from Count Dooku, but he wasn't interested in a prolonged war and ordered Kalani to retreat the remaining army to [[Agamar]]. Count Dooku signaled to Kalani to kill Rash, who stood up as he protested to the Count's orders but before he could finish, he was shot dead by Kalani. As Kalani and the droid army retreated from the planet, the rule was brought back to Dendup, ending the Separatist occupation.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{TCW|A War on Two Fronts}} {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n*{{TCW|Front Runners}}\n*{{TCW|The Soft War}}\n*{{TCW|Tipping Points}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWE|characters|king-sanjay-rash|King Sanjay Rash}}\n*{{SWE|characters|minabonteri|Mina Bonteri}}\n*{{SWE|groups|onderonrebels|Onderon rebels}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]'' {{Imo}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|20|Databank A-Z|Saw Gerrera&ndash;Commander Gree}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|24|Weapons & Uniforms|Terror of the IG-100s}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|41|Databank A-Z|'Occupier' Tank&ndash;Oola}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Alien Archive]]'' {{Imo}}\n*{{HelmetCollectionCite|55|Weapons & Uniforms|Saw Gerrera's Partisans}}\n*{{BuildR2Cite|57|Droid Directory|IG-100 MagnaGuard}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''\n*{{EncyclopediaCite|Battle Droids and Other War Droids}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Battles that Changed the Galaxy]]''\n*{{Databank|aat-battle-tank|AAT Battle Tank|archivedate=20180414212132}}\n*{{Databank|general-tandin|General Tandin|archivedate=20170626183734}}\n*{{Databank|king-sanjay-rash|King Sanjay Rash|archivedate=20200415081319}}\n*{{Databank|lux-bonteri|Lux Bonteri|archivedate=20200220155937}}\n*{{Databank|rebel-alliance|Rebel Alliance|archivedate=20190401134341}}\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession box\n|title=[[King]] of [[Onderon]]\n|years=[[22 BBY]]<ref name=\"Front Runners\">{{TCW|Front Runners}}</ref>&ndash;[[19 BBY]]<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n|before=[[Ramsis Dendup]]<ref name=\"Front Runners\" />\n|before-years=&ndash;[[22 BBY]]<ref name=\"Front Runners\" />\n|after=[[Ramsis Dendup]]<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n|after-years=[[19 BBY]]<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />&ndash;\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Sanjay Rash\n|ja=\u30b5\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30fb\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\n|pl=Sanjay Rash\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rash, Sanjay}}\n[[Category:Confederacy of Independent Systems individuals]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monarchs of Onderon]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
