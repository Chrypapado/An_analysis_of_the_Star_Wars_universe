He is featured in the Jedi Knight-class mission \"The Death Mark\" and is the focus of a conversation choice with three options when he attempts to arrest the Knight. The neutral option of asking to be let go causes Hark to offer herself in the Knight's place, and the player later learns that Hark killed Yils and the other guards before escaping the castle grounds. The [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark-side]] option sees the player killing the other guards and defeating Yils before Hark steps in and also results in Yils' death at Hark's hands. However, the third option, which is also neutral, allows players to Force-persuade Yils to release both the player and Hark, and as a result, Hark does not kill Yils.<ref name=\"Death Mark\" /> As a Republic character, the Jedi Knight is assumed to only choose the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light-side]] options,<ref name=\"Light Side\">This article assumes that the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] classes in ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' choose the options that provide the most [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light-side]] alignment points.</ref> so this article ignores the dark-side option of attacking but leaves the player's choice and Yils' fate open for the reader to decide.<ref name=\"Death Mark\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:House Alde]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
