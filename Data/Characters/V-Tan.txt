Their visions and dreams involved [[Masked Soldiers]] invading the planet.<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" /> They also had dreams and visions of their destruction through an explosive device that could wipe out a planet,<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" /> hinting at the coming [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]].{{Fact}} Together, the two developed a system of isolationism in an attempt to thwart the invasion, but the [[Keganite]]s eventually rejected their leaders upon learning of the brainwashing children underwent at the [[Re-Learning Circle]].<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\n==History==\nV-Tan and O-Veive set up an isolationist government that controlled the people rigorously. They were more-or-less dictators on an officially-democratic planet [[Kegan]], allowing votes but controlling the subject of the vote. Furthermore, [[autohopper]]s, automatically controlled [[Skyhopper/Legends|skyhoppers]], were used to monitor the people, their movements, and their conversations. To encourage the isolated behavior, the pair developed a curriculum known as [[The Learning]] around [[59 BBY]]. This school of thought emphasized sacrificing one's own desires in favor of contributing to the [[General Good]]. A school known as the [[Learning Circle]] was set up outside the city to teach kids from the ages of four to sixteen. Furthermore, a secret [[Re-Learning Circle]] was created within the [[Learning Circle]] to brainwash people to believe as V-Tan and O-Vieve did if they became undisciplined or were considered too physically ill to contribute to society. While Keganites under V-Tan's rule enjoyed a mostly peaceful society where all of their basic needs were met, the isolationist policy restricted the people from benefiting from advances throughout the [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]] in medicine, technology, and other fields.<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\nThe two guides lived in the [[Central Dwelling]], part of the [[Gathering Circle]] at the center of the city of Kegan.<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\n==Downfall==\nAfter [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Adi Gallia/Legends|Adi Gallia]], and [[Siri Tachi/Legends|Siri Tachi]] came to the planet to assess if [[Olana Chion|a baby]] born on the planet was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], V-Tan and O-Veive had the child kidnapped and sent to the Re-Learning Circle. The [[Master]]s, while searching for O-Lana and their Padawans, who had also been captured by a [[Truant Guide]], disrupted the system of skyhoppers that closely monitored the populace and helped rescue their [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]] from the secure school. After they escaped, they exposed V-Tan and O-Veive for their totalitarian ways, and the two rulers were voted out from the post of Benevolent Guides of Kegan.<ref name=\"The Fight for Truth\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Fight for Truth]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' {{1stID|Tan}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=V-Tan\n|es=V-Tan\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Keganites]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
