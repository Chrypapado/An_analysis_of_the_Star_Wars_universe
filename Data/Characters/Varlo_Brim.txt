There was some suspicion of a conspiracy regarding the fire as Brim was found [[Death/Legends|dead]] of 'natural causes' in his cube almost immediately afterward in an unlikely coincidence. The cause of death was listed as [[Heart/Legends|heart]] failure, although this was entered onto his death certificate before the body had arrived at the morgue. Furthermore there was no detailed examination of the corpse.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Death Star (novel)|''Death Star'']] {{1stm}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Varlo Brim\n|ja=\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30ed\u30fb\u30d6\u30ea\u30e0\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brim, Varlo}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
