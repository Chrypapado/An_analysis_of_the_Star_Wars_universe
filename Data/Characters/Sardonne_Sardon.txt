She was present at the [[Trial of Tahiri Veila]] in its later stages, defending [[Tahiri Veila]] along with [[Eramuth Bwua'tu]].\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSardonne Sardon's portrayal in ''[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex]]'' is rather inconsistent in terms of [[Species/Legends|species]]. When she is first introduced on page 160 of the novel, she is identified as a [[Lorrdian/Legends|Lorrdian]] [[Gender/Legends|female]]. However, in a scene later in the novel, she is described as a [[Falleen/Legends|Falleen]], complete with the species' dorsal spines, face scales, small claws on her fingers, and usage of pheromones to manipulate others' emotions. This discrepancy has not yet been addressed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex]]'' {{1st|''Fate of the Jedi: Vortex'' audiobook}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Vortex'' audiobook]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sardonne Sardon\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sardon, Sardonne}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Legal professionals]]\n[[Category:Lorrdians]]"}}}]}}}}
