My name's Gelesi. I'm a checkpoint Captain in the Merchant Quarter.|Gelesi|audio=Gelesi.ogg|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Gelesi''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived in the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon's]] walled [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] with his [[Gelesi's wife|wife]] and [[Gelesi's daughter|daughter]]. In [[3951 BBY]], after his superior [[Officer/Legends|officer]] and good friend, [[Sullio]], was [[Death/Legends|murdered]] outside a [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|cantina]], he inherited her rank as [[Captain of the Guard/Legends|Captain of the Guard]] and her former post. An officer in the [[Onderonian military]], his duties included the verification of [[starport visa]]s that allowed passage to and from the planet at the entrance to the [[Iziz Starport]]. At the [[Time/Legends|time]], the entire planet was enmeshed in a [[Politics/Legends|political]] struggle between loyalists to [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]] and her [[Onderon Royalist|faction]], who wanted Onderon to remain a part of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], and the [[Onderon separatists|secessionist followers]] of her cousin, [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]]. Gelesi was ambivalent, due to his loyalty to the Queen and his simultaneous disillusionment with the Republic, sympathizing with the separatist view that Onderonian membership had resulted in being drawn into too many conflicts. After the onset of a [[Onderon Civil War|militaristic coup]] perpetrated by Vaklu, Gelesi chose to support Talia's faction and fought to protect the Queen during a [[Second Battle of Onderon (Onderon Civil War)|final push]] by separatist forces into the [[Iziz Royal Palace|Royal Palace]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Sullio was captain of the checkpoint for years. I never knew why she came here every night until I got her job.|Gelesi|audio=Gelesi-Sullio.ogg|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nBy [[3951 BBY]],<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> during the [[Dark Wars]], the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Gelesi had a [[Gelesi's wife|wife]] and a [[Gelesi's daughter|young daughter]]. That [[Standard year/Legends|year]], he lived in the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Onderon/Legends|Onderon's]] walled [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Iziz/Legends|Iziz]] and served in the [[Onderonian military]]. He inherited a position as one of three [[Captain of the Guard/Legends|Captains of the Guard]] when his predecessor and good friend, [[Sullio]], was [[Death/Legends|murdered]] outside an [[Unidentified Iziz cantina|Iziz cantina]]. Gelesi was shaken by Sullio's death, not only because of their friendship but because he had also unwillingly been given her post at the [[Iziz Starport]], verifying that individuals who wished to disembark from the planet had the required [[starport visa]]s. Faced with those circumstances, Gelesi became increasingly paranoid, fearing that he would suffer the same fate and leave his family without a father. He dealt with the stress by adopting one of Sullio's habits, visiting a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] in Iziz's Merchant Quarter for a drink after each of his shifts.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n\nThe city of Iziz was locked in controversy surrounding the [[Politics/Legends|political views]] of Onderon's [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Talia (Onderon)|Talia]] and her unwavering support of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Those who opposed the Queen's devotion believed that it was in Onderon's best interest to secede from the Republic, primarily because the planet had been obliged to engage in several [[Old Sith Wars|wars]] as a member state. Those people rallied behind Talia's cousin, [[General/Legends|General]] [[Vaklu]], who led the [[Onderon separatists|separatist movement]]. The Queen's supporters, denoted the [[Onderon Royalist|Royalists]], believed that the trade benefits and protection of the Republic outweighed the conflicts. Gelesi was torn between the two groups due to his loyalty to the Queen and his distrust of the Republic, as well as sympathy for the separatist view that Onderon had been drawn into too many battles.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n\n{{GameLS}}\nGelesi was one of the [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] who verified a [[Spaceport/Legends|starport]] visa owned by [[Meetra Surik]] as the former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] was departing from the world. Shortly thereafter, Onderon fell into [[Onderon Civil War|full-scale civil war]] between the separatist faction and the Royalists, and Gelesi fought for the latter. He met with Surik, who was asked to take a military command of the Royalists upon her return, during an [[Second Battle of Onderon (Onderon Civil War)|assault]] on the [[Iziz Royal Palace]] perpetrated by Vaklu's [[Army/Legends|militarized allies]]. There, he fought alongside Surik to defeat the insurgents.<ref name=\"K2\" /> With his army beaten, Vaklu was taken into custody and executed for inciting the rebellion,<ref name=\"CSWE-Valku\">{{CSWECite|III||Vaklu}}</ref> thus ending the war.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGelesi, a fair-skinned Human male with [[Color/Legends|brown]] hair and green [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], was a member of the Onderon Military, wearing the fatigues of that profession. Overall, he was a neutral [[Officer/Legends|officer]], divided by his support for Queen Talia and his sympathy for some beliefs of Vaklu's faction that coupled with his distrust of the Republic. Following Sullio's murder, Gelesi was unwillingly assigned to her post at Iziz Starport, scanning starport visas.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n\nWhile Sullio was alive, Gelesi wondered why his good friend went to a cantina after all her shifts&mdash;until he received her job and adopted the same habit because he feared for the lives of himself and his family. In his own opinion, the stress of the job and the perception that he could share Sullio's fate made him increasingly paranoid. He constantly felt like he was being targeted by some force. The anxiety festered inside Gelesi to the point where he considered abandoning his post and fleeing the planet with his family; however, he decided against such action.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|I have a wife and daughter to look after. And I feel like a target now. I'm tempted to just grab my family and take the first shuttle out of here.|Gelesi, if the Jedi Exile supports Vaklu|audio=Gelesi-Family.ogg|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nThe character of Gelesi was created for the [[Obsidian Entertainment]] [[Xbox]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''.<ref name=\"K2\" /> Gelesi was voiced by [[Chris Cox]].{{Fact}} He later received an entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', published in [[2008]].<ref name=\"CSWE-Gelesi\">{{CSWECite|I||Gelesi}}</ref>\n\nThere are alternative paths that the Jedi Exile&mdash;controlled by the player&mdash;can take if she supports Vaklu's faction during her first visit to Onderon. At the request of a Vaklu supporter named [[Anda]], the Exile can remove the three [[Captain/Legends|Captains]] of the Guard in order to weaken the Royalist military in preparation for the attack on the Royal Palace. Anda is willing to pay the Exile {{Cr}} 2,500 for each one she removes.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n\nIf the Exile supports Vaklu during her initial visit to Onderon, she meets Gelesi in the cantina in the Merchant Quarter of Iziz, where he is persuaded to leave the city to protect his family. Another way to remove him is to have [[Panar]], a [[Beast Riders|Beast Rider]] who frequents the Beast Rider's Den in the cantina, threaten to kidnap and marry Gelesi's daughter. If persuasion fails, there is a group of thugs outside the cantina who can be hired to attack Gelesi, after which he leaves the planet, fearing for his family's safety. If the latter option is chosen, Anda becomes angry because she wanted the captains removed quietly; however, she will still pay the Exile. This side quest is only available if the Exile supports Vaklu during her initial visit to Iziz, and this can either impact her stance in the Force in a [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark]] way or not at all. Should the Exile complete this path and support Talia during her second visit to the planet, Gelesi will leave the planet, so he will not aid the Royalists in the final battle.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n\nBecause ''The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia'' established that the Exile supported the Queen during her second visit,<ref name=\"CSWE-Valku\" /> this article assumes that she also acted as a Royalist during her first visit and that she did not remove Gelesi.<ref name=\"K2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Gelesi}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gelesi\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers]]\n[[Category:Onderon military personnel]]\n[[Category:Onderon Royalists]]\n[[Category:Onderonians]]"}}}]}}}}
