And as long as you had him, you hadn't let them all down...|[[Tyria Sarkin Tainer|Tyria Sarkin]] to Donos on his devotion to his astromech droid [[Shiner]]|X-Wing: Wraith Squadron}}\nDonos's life before joining Wraith Squadron was traumatic, even among his notoriously hard-luck squad mates. A sniper in the Corellian Armed Forces, Donos became a focused marksman. However, he felt his mind start nagging at him that what he was doing was wrong, as he often had to shoot his targets without giving them a chance.\n\nLooking for a place to put his doubts behind, Donos joined [[Starfighter Command (Rebel Alliance)|Starfighter Command]], quickly rising through the ranks and becoming a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] in a year. Given the rank of bevret [[Captain/Legends|Captain]], Donos was given command of [[Talon Squadron]] upon graduation. When Talon Squadron was destroyed in an Imperial [[Ambush at Gravan Seven|ambush]] on [[Gravan Seven]]\u2014Donos being the sole survivor\u2014he was removed from active service, but came to the attention of [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] when Antilles and [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]] began assembling the commando/pilot hybrid squadron that would become Wraith Squadron. Janson recommended the traumatized pilot, as much from compassion as respect of Donos's pilot capabilities.<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" />\n\n[[File:OriginalWraiths.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Myn Donos with the Wraith Squadron.]]\n\nPrior to his New Republic military service, Donos was awarded the prestigious [[Corellian Bloodstripe]] by the Corellian military for conspicuous gallantry, but stopped wearing them after the debacle on Gravan Seven. Anguished by the obliteration of his pilots, Donos was morose and introverted during his early days with the Wraiths, where he flew as [[Wraith Nine (callsign)|Wraith Nine]] and served as the squadron's sniper. Fellow pilot [[Falynn Sandskimmer]], a tough woman from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], tried to help him through his depression and they developed a deep mutual attraction in the process.<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" />\n\nDonos formed a deep connection to his [[Astromech droid]], nicknamed [[Shiner]]- he came to view this droid as \"the last Talon\" since he too had survived the ambush. As a result Myn developed an absolute need to keep Shiner safe from any harm. When the squadron was hit by an [[Empion mine]] and Shiner was knocked offline, Donos was unable to respond to any other communication until the droid was fixed.\n\nDuring the battle over [[M2398]] Shiner was destroyed in a pirate ambush. In the aftermath of this loss Donos became near catatonic, refusing to respond or acknowledge the world around him. Wraith medical officer [[Ton Phanan]] reported this as a \"concussion\" caused during the battle to avoid ruining Donos' career. The other Wraiths eventually found a way to bring Donos out of his state- by forcing him into a [[Flight simulator]] recreation of the Gravan Seven mission. Furious, Donos attacked the other squadron members, declaring his anguish that he had not died with the rest of Talon Squadron. The combined efforts of [[Kell Tainer]] and [[Tyria Sarkin Tainer|Tyria Sarkin]] helped convince Donos that he could better honor their memory by continuing to fight the forces that had killed his comrades. This event helped Donos begin to cope rather than bury his emotions, and he at last began to reciprocate Falynn Sandskimmers' feelings for him; the two entered a relationship soon after.\n\nIn the battle that saw the destruction of the [[Implacable (Imperial-class)|''Implacable'']] over [[Ession]], Donos witnessed the death of both Sandskimmer and fellow Wraith [[Eurrsk Thri'ag]]. In this same battle he exacted a measure of revenge for Talon Squadron. He discovered [[Apwar Trigit]]'s customized [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|TIE/In starfighter]] fleeing the dying ship and teamed up with [[General/Legends|General]] [[Edor Crespin]] to chase him down. After Trigit initially refused to surrender, Donos launched a pair of [[Proton torpedo/Legends|proton torpedoes]], denying Trigit a second chance to give up after his escort of two TIEs was destroyed. Trigit's ship was destroyed, killing the Admiral.<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" />\n{{Quote|Pretty. What do we blow up first?|Myn Donos to [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]]|X-Wing: Solo Command}}\nAfter new Wraith [[Lara Notsil]] received a message from her long-lost brother [[Tavin Notsil|Tavin,]] Donos theorized that Warlord Zsinj had gotten in touch with Tavin and persuaded him to contact Lara as a way to harm the Wraiths (at the time Donos had no idea that Lara Notsil was really an Imperial agent named [[Gara Petothel]], or that she was the woman who provided Trigit with the information he needed to eliminate Talon Squadron.<ref name=\"IronFist\" />) Donos flew to [[Aldivy]] with Lara for a reunion with her brother, serving as sniper once again to provide cover from a distance. When Tavin and his escort pulled weapons on Lara, Donos shot the pair. He did not know the true context of their encounter- Lara had initially contacted Zsinj herself but eventually chose to reject Zsinj's service and remain with Wraith Squadron; the sudden deaths of both agents kept her secret safe.\n\nShortly afterward, Donos began to fall in love with [[Gara Petothel|Lara Notsil]], who seemed to develop feelings for him as well.  When [[Garik Loran]] inadvertently revealed her deception to the Wraiths at [[Kidriff 5]], Donos tried to kill her, but nearly destroyed Loran instead. Antilles chose to report the firing of Donos's weapons as \"accidental\", provided Donos received medical and [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment. With the help of his friends and comrades, Donos came out of his tailspin and rejoined the squadron as they prepared to attack [[Zsinj]] near [[Kuat/Legends|Selaggis.]] While in battle, Donos demanded the starfighter group to break off their attack on the [[Iron Fist (Executor-class)]] due to a pending ambush; which Commander Wedge Antillies initially feared as a sign Donos had lapsed back into mental trauma over Talon Squadron. In truth, Donos had recalled a training exercise from early in his career where Warlord Zsinj had lured starfighters into an asteroid field and opened fire on the surrounding asteroids, slaughtering the attackers. Thanks to his efforts, the New Republic forces were able to avoid Zsinjs' trap and wage a direct attack on Iron Fist.\n\nFollowing the battle with Zsinj at [[Selaggis Six]], Myn accepted a position with [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]], choosing to fly rather than remain with the Wraiths who joined [[New Republic Intelligence Service|New Republic Intelligence]].<ref name=\"SoloCommand\">''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''</ref>\n\nDonos flew with the Rogues during the [[Thrawn campaign]] and fought in the [[Battle of Bilbringi (9 ABY)|Battle of Bilbringi]] that saw [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] death. Rogue Squadron was then assigned to the [[Hegemony theater]], where they fought against Prince-Admiral [[Delak Krennel]], a warlord and leader of the [[Ciutric Hegemony]]. Donos fought in the [[Battle of Distna]], where he was believed dead along with most of the squadron. However, they were actually rescued by [[TIE/D Defender|TIE Defender]] squadrons led by Colonel [[Broak Vessery]], an Imperial loyal to [[Ysanne Isard]]. Isard made an alliance with Rogue Squadron against Krennel, and arranged for them to use TIE Defenders to infiltrate Krennel's forces. Donos fought in the resulting [[Battle of Ciutric]], which saw the deaths of Krennel and a clone of Isard, as well as the liberation of General [[Jan Dodonna/Legends|Jan Dodonna]] and other prisoners.<ref name=\"IsardsRevenge\">''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Zsinj campaign, Donos and Petothel&mdash;who had taken the alias \"Kirney Slane\"&mdash;were married,<ref name=\"AaronsWebsite\">[http://www.aaronallston.com/faqswars.html Aaron Allston FAQ]</ref> and by [[40 ABY]] the pair had founded a transport company called \"[[Donoslane Excursions]]\" on Corellia.<ref name=\"Betrayal\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]''</ref> They had also had at least two children by the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[44 ABY]].<ref name=\"Mercy Kill\">''[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe likeness of Myn Donos was based on [[Bradley Wayne Hanson]], a friend of Star Wars artist [[Joe Corroney]].<ref name=\"BradleyHanson\">[http://www.bradleywaynehanson.com/ Bradley Wayne Hanson's website]</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Myn.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Myn Donos close-up]]\n*''[[X-Wing: Wraith Squadron]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]''\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]''\n*''[[Dark Force Rising]]'' {{C|as [[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]]}}\n}}\n*[[Dark Force Rising (unabridged audiobook)|''Dark Force Rising'' audiobook]] {{C|as [[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]]}}\n*''[[The Last Command]]'' {{C|as Rogue Seven}}\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]] {{C|as Rogue Seven}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Isard's Revenge]]''\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{Imo}}\n*''[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[X-Wing: Mercy Kill (audiobook)|''X-Wing: Mercy Kill'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|59|Who's Who in Rogue Squadron}}\n*{{GamerCite|9|Wraith Squadron (article)|Wraith Squadron}}\n*{{GamerCite|10|Special Ops: The Sharpshooter}}\n*''[[Hero's Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Galaxy at War]]''\n\n{{Start box}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Wraith Nine (callsign)|Wraith Nine]] of [[Wraith Squadron]]<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" />\n|years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]]<ref name=\"WraithSquadron\" /> &mdash; [[7 ABY/Legends|7.5 ABY]]<ref name=\"SoloCommand\" />\n|before=N/A\n|after=[[Shalla Nelprin]]<ref name=\"SoloCommand\" />}}\n{{Succession_box\n|title=[[Rogue Seven/Legends|Rogue Seven]] of [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]<ref name=\"IsardsRevenge\" />\n|years=[[7 ABY/Legends|7.5 ABY]]<ref name=\"SoloCommand\" /> &mdash; [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]]<ref name=\"IsardsRevenge\" />\n|before=[[Ran Kether]]<ref name=\"SoloCommand\" />\n|after=Eventually [[Tycho Celchu]]<ref name=\"SpecterofthePast\">''[[Specter of the Past]]''</ref>\n}}\n{{End box}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aaronallston.com/faqswars.html Aaron Allston FAQ]\n\n{{Interlang\n|cs=Myn Donos\n|de=Myn Donos\n|ru=\u041c\u0438\u043d \u0414\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donos, Myn}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n[[Category:Pilots]]\n[[Category:Rogue Squadron personnel]]\n[[Category:Sharpshooters and snipers]]\n[[Category:Wraith Squadron personnel]]"}}}]}}}}
