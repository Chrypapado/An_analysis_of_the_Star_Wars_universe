If there's a nasty, secret bit of business, you can bet Fligh knows about it. So how could I ignore his advice?|[[Didi Oddo]]|Jedi Quest: The Dangerous Games}}\n'''Fligh''' was a petty thief and informer for [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Didi Oddo]]. He was a tall, slender [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] with a bright green [[Cybernetics/Legends|prosthetic]] eye to replace one he had lost in a strife with [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]]. Fligh had a long face and prominent ears.<ref name=\"The Deadly Hunter\" />\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Didi! Old friend! Such a surprise to see you on Euceron! Though everyone who is anyone is here, so there you go, not such a surprise after all.|Fligh to Didi Oddo, at the Galactic Games.|Jedi Quest: The Dangerous Games}}\nFligh often hung around the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]], he knew everyone and passed information for credits. In [[43 BBY/Legends|43 BBY]] he was hired by [[Helb]] to steal Senator [[Uta S'orn]]'s [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]]<ref name=\"The Deadly Hunter\" /> after which he was believed murdered as a body that resembled his was found garroted and drained of blood. In reality he had faked his death and fled to [[Belasco/Legends|Belasco]] where he later reemerged when he gave the datapad to the Jedi. Fligh and three other thieves ended up working for [[Didi Oddo|Didi]] and [[Astri Oddo]].\n\nIn [[26 BBY/Legends|26 BBY]] he tipped Didi Oddo on a bet for the [[Galactic Games/Legends|Galactic Games]] on [[Euceron]] (for one of its rigged events), after which he returned to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. By that time, his appearance had changed somewhat: though still thin and spidery, his long ears were now even longer, with the lobes resting on his shoulders, and a tuft of graying yellow hair sprouted from his balding head. Beyond this, Fligh had replaced his fake green eye, which had been his pride and joy, with a bright gold one. Neither had he lost his idiosyncratic phrasing \"''...so there you go'',\" which he had ever interjected into his speech to punctuate his ideas.<ref>''[[Jedi Quest: The Dangerous Games]]''</ref>\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Deadly Hunter]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Evil Experiment]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Dangerous Rescue]]''\n*''[[Jedi Quest: The Dangerous Games]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Fligh\n|es=Fligh\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Information brokers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]"}}}]}}}}
