Jeen immediately felt the fortress' dark aura, and the dark side of the Force whispered to him in his mind and and tried to tempt him into submitting to its will. Jeen silently strove to overcome the dark side's influence, while Qornah failed to notice his apprentice's internal struggle, and the two Jedi set off on foot across the surface of Almas, in the direction of the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] fortress.
