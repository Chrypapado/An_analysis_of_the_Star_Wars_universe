Upon the discovery of Wilk's mutation, his [[Wilk's mother|mother]] abandoned him, leaving him to fend for himself. Wilk was then found by the hermit [[Bloch]], who took him in and taught him how to [[Language/Legends|speak]]. However, Wilk occasionally chose to conceal his ability of speech when the situation called for it, acting as a simple domesticated pet. Later, Wilk left Endor with his friend [[El Borak]] to explore the larger [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].\n\n==Biography==\nWilk, a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Wolf/Legends|wolf]], was born on the [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon of Endor]] in the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], during the height of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]]. His [[Wilk's mother|mother]] was a normal wolf, but Wilk was born with a [[Gene/Legends|gene]]tic defect, making him a [[mutant]] and unique among the wolves on Endor. As a result, he was abandoned by his [[Parent/Legends|mother]] and eventually discovered by [[Bloch]], a hermit, who taught Wilk how to [[Language/Legends|speak]], among other things about the surrounding world. Wilk later paired up with his friend [[El Borak]], and together they traveled throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. At some point, the two friends came into contact with the insane [[Doctor/Legends|Doctor]] [[Ames]], who brought them along on a dangerous quest. In another instance, Wilk engaged [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]] in [[Space warfare|space combat]] and shot several down, which he believed was a first for his species. Wilk survived until at least the time of the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], in [[0 ABY/Legends|0 ABY]].<ref name=\"Mutants\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nWilk was a very large wolf, weighing almost 300 [[Kilogram/Legends|kilograms]] and growing to a height of 1.3 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]]. He was also extremely long-lived for a wolf, having reached the age of thirty-three years old as of 0 BBY. Wilk spoke with a very refined style, and those whom met him were initially shocked by his proper speech. However, Wilk sometimes played the part of a simple animal companion when certain situations called for it. Wilk also had a grasp of technology, overcoming designs ill-suited to his anatomy to destroy several enemy TIE [[Starfighter/Legends|fighters]]. Wilk was usually friendly with a good sense of humor, but he could become incredibly violent when someone he liked was attacked. In such confrontations, Wilk used his large claws as formidable weapons.<ref name=\"Mutants\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWilk appeared in ''[[dossier BXLH: Les mutants dans Star Wars]]'' (translated, ''File BXLH: The mutants in Star Wars''), a [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] article published in the [[1990]] French magazine ''[[Graal 23]]''.
