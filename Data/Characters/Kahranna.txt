She and her family were [[Refugee/Legends|refugees]] of the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and the [[Jedi Civil War]]. Trapped on the moon by a [[Transport/Legends|transport]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] who dumped Kahranna and her kin there, she was desperate to get herself and her family off Nar Shaddaa and had paid a man named [[Planore]] to help her. When Planore did not come through on the deal, Kahranna was forced to beg and then rely on [[Meetra Surik]], who was visiting the moon. She and her family were later transported to [[Telos IV]] after Surik spoke with the [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Courier/Legends|courier]] [[Lasavvou]] about their plight.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Oh. We were expecting one of the pilots from the docks sometime soon to come and get us off Nar Shaddaa. He is late&mdash;I don't know where he is.|Kahranna, to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nA [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]], Kahranna was a [[Refugee/Legends|refugee]] displaced by the conflicts of the [[Mandalorian Wars]] and [[Jedi Civil War]]. She and her family lived in the [[Refugee Sector]] of [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], the largest [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]],<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> during the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> They had been abandoned on the so-called \"Smuggler's Moon\" by a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] they had paid to [[Transport/Legends|transport]] them.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|II|192|Kahranna}}</ref> Kahranna later spoke with a [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] named [[Planore]], who offered to refer her and her family to a pilot friend of his for {{Cr}}50. Planore said that his friend would transport Kahranna and her family off-world for {{Cr}}500, but he had yet to come through on his offer.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n{{GameLSmechanics}}\nDuring that [[Time/Legends|time]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Meetra Surik]] was visiting the moon in search of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]]. She spoke with Kahranna, who asked Surik if she was the [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] she was expecting. She was not, and Kahranna explained the situation with Planore to her, which Surik automatically expected was a scam and told Kahranna so. Upset by the news, she asked Surik for help, which the former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] Knight agreed to. Sometime later, Surik was able to convince an [[Ithorian/Legends|Ithorian]] [[Courier/Legends|courier]] named [[Lasavvou]] to provide Kahranna and her family with transportation to [[Telos IV]] in exchange for helping him pay his departure fee.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I suspect Planore scammed you.''\"<br />\"''I was afraid of that. I knew I shouldn't have trusted him.|Meetra Surik and Kahranna|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nKahranna loved her family and was desperate to see them off Nar Shaddaa and off to a better life somewhere else. While she was a bit naive in willing to trust a stranger on the Smuggler's Moon, she had expected it was a scam but was too desperate to turn down the opportunity to leave the moon. She had [[Color/Legends|blonde]] hair, [[brown]] [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and light skin.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKahranna appears in the [[2004]] [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'', developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]]. The player, cast as the Jedi Exile, may interact with and receive a quest from Kahranna while visiting Nar Shaddaa. While interaction or completion of Kahranna's quest is not absolutely required to further the game's plot, completing her quest will raise the [[Exchange]] criminal organization's notice of the player's activities on the moon, which is required to further the plot.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n====Alternative outcomes====\nA second option to complete the quest is to convince Fassa to provide transport for Kahranna and her family. The player can also tell her that they are the person she is expecting, and can convince her to handover the 500 credits for the transport, or tell her that the fees have increased to 800 credits, to which she will offer 600. Accepting any amount of credits from her results in [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> The ''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' lists convincing Fassa to help Kahranna as the only outcome,<ref name=\"KOTOR2SG\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> but, with the release of ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'', the [[canon]] outcome was solidified as the one depicted in this article.<ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Kahranna\n}}\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]"}}}]}}}}
