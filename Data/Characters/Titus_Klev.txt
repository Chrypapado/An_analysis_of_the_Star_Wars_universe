Do they really think they can penetrate our defenses with these new ships?|Titus Klev, during the battle of Mon Calamari|Dark Empire 4}}\n'''Titus Klev''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Imperial officer/Legends|officer]] of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. An active member of the [[Sub-Adult Group/Legends|Sub-Adult Group]], he was accepted into [[CompForce/Legends|CompForce]] despite his young age and later became the thirty-seventh generation of [[Klev family|Klevs]] to enter the [[Imperial Naval Academy]] after being rejected once. Following the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Battle of Endor/Legends|defeat]] at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], Klev was assigned to [[Battle Station Operations/Legends|Battle Station Operations]]. While aboard a [[Dedicated Siege Platform]] in the [[Siege of Wann Tsir]], he discovered a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] agent attempting to sabotage the platform. Klev was commended for his discovery and received a promotion, with many believing that he was on his way to becoming a [[Moff/Legends|Moff]].\n\nIn [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]], Klev, a [[General/Legends|general]], was a member of the resurrected [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Dark Empire|forces]]. He commanded the [[World Devastator]] strike force from the ''[[Silencer-7]]'' in an [[Battle of Calamari|assault on Mon Calamari]], in which his force inflicted heavy damage on the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]]. His path to the title of Moff ended in the [[Ocean/Legends|oceans]] of [[Dac]], where he [[Death/Legends|died]] when the World Devastators were sabotaged by the [[R2-series astromech droid|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] into colliding with each other.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Send a message to Byss. Inform Supreme Commander Skywalker of their presence&hellip; Meanwhile, let's give the Alliance a taste of what they're up against!|Klev, onboard the ''Silencer-7'' at Mon Calamari|Dark Empire 3}}\nTitus Klev was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Alsakan/Legends|Alsakan]] into privilege, [[Klev|his father]] being a high-ranking veteran of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] and his mother being the wealthy heiress of a trading company. In his early [[Standard year/Legends|years]], Titus Klev was an active participant in the [[Sub-Adult Group/Legends|Sub-Adult Group]], the largest branch of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order/Legends|Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]]. He was one of the first enrolled in the SAGroup; while a member, he proved to be skilled in the competitive sport known as [[Wegsphere]], in which two teams playing in a low gravity well attempted to place a ball into the opponent's goal. At age 13, Klev was sent to a special training camp on the planet [[Ibanjji]] and, after saving an instructor from a pack of wild [[Varn (creature)|varns]], was accepted into [[CompForce/Legends|CompForce]] despite being four years underage.<ref name=\"DES\" />\n\n[[File:TitusKlev.jpg|thumb|left|Klev aboard the ''Silencer-7'' during the battle of Mon Calamari]]\nThough Klev volunteered for CompForce Assault, his parents arranged for him to go into Observation, where he became [[Chief Ideological Monitor]]. Wanting some excitement, he applied to enter the [[Imperial Naval Academy]], though he was rejected once for insufficient grades. However, a fellow SAGroup member bent the rules to allow him in. As a result, Titus Klev became the 37th generation of [[Klev family|Klevs]] to enter the Academy. While there, he was noted as being the kind of Human that was usually featured in Imperial propaganda, and he graduated first in his class.<ref name=\"DES\" />\n\nKlev never got the chance to serve aboard the [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II]] [[battlestation]], but in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Imperial defeat at Endor]], he was assigned to [[Battle Station Operations/Legends|Battle Station Operations]], serving aboard [[Dedicated Siege Platform]]s. Klev participated in the [[siege of Wann Tsir]] aboard such a platform, and during the battle he discovered a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] agent attempting to sabotage his vessel's [[Deflector shield/Legends|shields]]. The discovery of the infiltrator earned Klev a commendation and a promotion, and his peers thought that he would eventually reach the rank of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]].<ref name=\"DES\" />\n\nBy the time of [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Dark Empire|resurgence]] in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]],<ref name=\"DE 3\">[[Dark Empire 3|''Dark Empire'' 3]]</ref> Klev had been promoted to [[General/Legends|general]]<ref name=\"EGW\">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref> and was placed in charge of the [[World Devastator]] ''[[Silencer-7]]'' as he led the Imperial forces during the [[Battle of Calamari|assault of Mon Calamari]], reporting to [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]]-turned-Imperial [[Supreme Commander (Empire)/Legends|Supreme Commander]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]].

And they can hardly realize the destructive power at our command&hellip; Their game is ''over''.|An Imperial officer and Titus Klev, during the battle of Mon Calamari|Dark Empire 3}}\nAs an adolescent, Titus Klev was rather skilled, excelling in the sport of Wegsphere. His exceptional abilities, combined with his saving of an instructor from varns on Ibanjji, gained him access to CompForce though underage. His grades originally prevented him from entrance into the Naval Academy, but after he was admitted, he graduated at the top of his class.<ref name=\"DES\" /> He was known to be a good [[Commander/Legends|commander]], having knowledge in both ship-to-ship combat and planetary assault tactics.<ref name=\"Rebellion\" />\n\nKlev's participation in the siege of [[Wann Tsir]] earned him respect in the eyes of his peers, and along with this respect came promotions. Many presumed that Klev would ultimately rise to the rank of Moff.<ref name=\"DES\" /> A step on that path was the command of the ''Silencer-7'' during the battle of Mon Calamari.<ref name=\"DE 3\" /> His tactics were ruthless against the New Republic opposition, and he went so far as to order the destruction of defenseless escape pods during the battle.<ref name=\"DEA\" /> During the attempted subjugation of the planet, he was overconfident, believing the armada of World Devastators to be unstoppable, and that the New Republic [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wings]] could do him no damage.<ref name=\"DE 3\" /> In the end, however, his overconfidence proved to be fatally wrong.<ref name=\"DE 4\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTitus Klev made his first appearance in the [[Dark Empire 3|third]] and [[Dark Empire 4|fourth]] issues of [[1992]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] series, written by [[Tom Veitch]] and illustrated by [[Cam Kennedy]]. He was voiced by [[Nick Jameson]] in the [[1994]] [[Dark Empire (audio)|audio adaptation of ''Dark Empire'']]. Klev would later appear in [[1998]]'s [[Star Wars: Rebellion (video game)|''Star Wars: Rebellion'']], where he was one of the Imperial NPCs that could be recruited to the player's forces. His biography was supplied in [[West End Games]] ''[[Dark Empire Sourcebook]]'', published in [[1993]].
