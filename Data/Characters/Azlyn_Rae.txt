During her childhood, she was [[Padawan/Legends|apprenticed]] to the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Rasi Tuum]] while [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] to be a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]. She grew close to her classmate [[Cade Skywalker]] while at the [[Jedi Academy (Ossus)|Jedi Academy]], but their relationship and her training were halted when [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Darth Krayt]]'s [[One Sith|Sith Order]] [[Massacre at Ossus|massacred]] the Jedi and Krayt [[Attack on Emperor Fel|seized]] control of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]]. Rae survived the [[Third Jedi Purge|Jedi Purge]] and believed both Tuum and Skywalker to be [[Death/Legends|dead]], prompting her to put her past behind her and become a [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]. When she was discovered by the Imperial Knights, she accepted their offer to join their ranks and complete her training. Rae swore oaths of loyalty to [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Roan Fel]] and began serving his [[Empire-in-exile]].\n\n[[137 ABY|Seven years]] after the scattering of the Jedi, Rae learned of Skywalker's survival when she was sent on an undercover mission by Fel to bring him to the Imperial [[fortress world]] of [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]]. After revealing herself to her old friend on [[Iego/Legends|Iego]], Rae earned his trust and was brought by him to a [[Hidden Temple (Sith&ndash;Imperial War)|Hidden Temple]] where the Jedi Order had been slowly rebuilding itself. There, she was reunited with Rasi Tuum and was ordered by her fellow Imperial Knight [[Marasiah Fel]] to accompany Skywalker on a [[Mission to Had Abbadon|mission]] to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Krayt. The mission led Skywalker's strike team to [[Had Abbadon/Legends|Had Abbadon]], where they lured Krayt into a [[Battle on Had Abbadon|trap]] and managed to mortally wound him after Rae [[Shiak|stabbed]] him through the chest. She herself was brought to the brink of death by Krayt's [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]], and Skywalker rushed her to [[Kiffex/Legends|Kiffex]] to be healed by his uncle [[Rawk]]. Rae accepted her impending death and resisted all efforts to heal her, but was nevertheless placed into a suit of life-preserving [[Armor/Legends|armor]] by Rawk and his wife [[Droo Rawk|Droo]]. She reacted angrily to her predicament, lashing out at Skywalker and accusing him of selfishly keeping her alive.\n\nAfter returning to Bastion, Rae was given less constricting armor by [[Hogrum Chalk]], the Imperial Knights' [[master armorer]], and soon after accompanied her Emperor to [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] to conduct [[Mission to Agamar|peace talks]] with the Jedi. The meeting was [[Operation: Thunderstroke|interrupted]] by [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] forces, and Rae, Tuum, and Marasiah were left behind when the Imperial Knights and Jedi evacuated the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Marasiah was taken by the Sith, and when Rae and Tuum's efforts to rescue her failed, they returned to Bastion to relay their news to the Emperor. Marasiah was later [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|rescued]] by Master [[Antares Draco]] and stood with Rae and several other Imperial Knights as they helped the Jedi [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|defend]] the Hidden Temple from attacking forces of [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Krayt's Empire]]. After the Jedi were evacuated, the [[Alliance (Second Imperial Civil War)|allied forces]] of the Empire-in-exile, the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant|Galactic Alliance]], and the Jedi Order [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|struck]] at Krayt's throneworld of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], and Rae joined a [[Cade Skywalker's strike team|strike team]] that brought down the world's [[Orbit/Legends|orbital]] defenses in advance of the attack. The war was won for the allies when Krayt was slain by Skywalker, and Rae afterward attended [[Funeral of Roan Fel|the funeral]] of Emperor Fel, who had fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] during the battle and had been killed by Draco.\n\n==Biography==\n===Shifting loyalties===\n{{Quote|After the Sith attacked&hellip; ''massacred!''&hellip; so many Jedi on Coruscant and Ossus&hellip; a lot of us apprentices just scattered&mdash;made our way the best we could.

He was a brief guest of Emperor Fel's on the Imperial [[fortress world]] of [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] after [[Skirmish on Vendaxa|rescuing]] Fel's daughter [[Marasiah Fel|Marasiah]] from the clutches of the Sith,<ref name=\"Legacy 7\">[[Legacy (2006) 7|''Legacy'' (2006) 7]]</ref> and was later a captive of Darth Krayt on Coruscant before [[Skirmish at the Temple of the Sith|escaping]].<ref name=\"Legacy 19\">[[Legacy (2006) 19|''Legacy'' (2006) 19]]</ref> When Fel was made aware of the latter development, he feared that Skywalker had divulged Imperial secrets to the Sith<ref name=\"Legacy 23\">[[Legacy (2006) 23|''Legacy'' (2006) 23]]</ref> and sent Rae out into the galaxy to locate him and convince him to return to Bastion.<ref name=\"Legacy 25\" />\n\n[[File:Reunionoflies.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rae and Skywalker are reunited on Iego.]]\nRae donned a bounty hunter disguise and tracked Skywalker to the [[Golden Gorg Cantina]] on the planet [[Socorro/Legends|Socorro]], where she observed he and his friends bully [[Rav]], the cantina's owner, into turning the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] ''[[Grinning Liar]]'' over to the [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] [[Chak (Wookiee)|Chak]] and [[Kee (Devaronian)|Kee]]. Before Skywalker departed the planet in his own starship, the [[Mynock (Helot-class)|''Mynock'']], Rae placed a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing beacon]] on its [[Hull/Legends|hull]]. She then followed the beacon to [[Iego/Legends|Iego]], [[Cloaking device/Legends|cloaking]] [[Azlyn Rae's GPE-7300 transport|her ship]] and staying a safe distance away from the ''Mynock''. On Iego, Skywalker helped his uncle [[Rawk]] [[Skirmish on Iego|dispatch]] some members of the [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] criminal organization that were causing trouble for Rawk's family, and Rae landed her ship away from Rawk's [[Rawk's Nest|home]] to observe the skirmish. When the criminals had been defeated, Rae reported her coordinates and status<ref name=\"Legacy 23\" /> to Marasiah Fel, who was following close behind in a [[Sigma-class long-range shuttle|starship]].<ref name=\"Legacy 24\" />\n\nWhile Skywalker and the ''Mynock''{{'s}} crew visited with Rawk and his family,<ref name=\"Legacy 24\" /> Rae awaited further instructions from Marasiah.<ref name=\"Legacy 23\" /> After four days, she sneaked up on Skywalker at the site of the landed ''Mynock'' and physically attacked her former friend. Skywalker was high on the euphoria of [[Death stick/Legends|death sticks]] and could not adequately defend himself, but his uncle swiftly arrived and was able to put up a fight. Rae and Rawk battled [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetically]] with the Force before Rae drew her lightsaber on the older man. He responded by brushing her arm out of the way and elbowing her in the face, knocking her out of the fight. Skywalker recovered and approached the two, prompting Rae to remove her mask and reveal her face. Surprised to see her, Skywalker invited her into Rawk's home to drink some [[Caf/Legends|caf]]. Therein, she sat down with Skywalker, Rawk, Rawk's wife [[Droo Rawk|Droo]], Skywalker's co-[[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Jariah Syn]], and his [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]], [[Deliah Blue]]. Rae told them of her past since the Sith's attack on Coruscant but left out any mention of the Imperial Knights, claiming to still be a bounty hunter and to have pursued Skywalker in the interest of collecting the bounty on his head. She also claimed to no longer be interested in collecting it, having realized that Skywalker was the same friend she remembered from her childhood. At that moment, Rawk's long-range [[Sensor/Legends|sensors]] detected the arrival of a [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] in [[Iego system|the system]], belonging to [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire]]. The crew of the ''Mynock'' hid while Rae and the Rawks received [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Gurlok]], the Imperial [[Officer/Legends|officer]] who landed on the ground to confront them.<ref name=\"Legacy 24\" />\n\nOutside of Rawk's home, the Captain and his [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] physically assaulted Rae and Rawk, demanding to know who had recently lent the Rawk family assistance in their battle with members of Black Sun. He did not believe Rae's claim that it had been her and threatened to harm Rawk's children until he got the answers he wanted. A [[Blood/Legends|bloodied]] Rae was able to use a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to persuade him to leave, and the Imperials departed Iego. Skywalker began preparations to leave himself, hoping to somehow kill Darth Krayt, which he believed would allow him to lose himself in the criminal underworld. Rawk suggested that he might find allies at a [[Hidden Temple (Sith&ndash;Imperial War)|Hidden Jedi Temple]] and boarded the ''Mynock'' in order to lead its crew there. Rae was permitted to join them, and as she moved her ship into the ''Mynock''{{'s}} cargo hold, she sent an update to Marasiah, who waited in her own ship with fellow Imperial Knights [[Antares Draco]] and [[Ganner Krieg]].<ref name=\"Legacy 24\" />\n\n[[File:Dontwalkawayeileen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rae discusses her conflicted loyalties with Marasiah Fel.]]\nThe ''Mynock'' traveled to the Hidden Temple on [[Taivas]], and after it arrived in-[[Zhar system|system]], Rae dropped a homing beacon out of its garbage disposal. Her fellow Imperial Knights followed the ''Mynock'' to the temple in their cloaked ship and landed immediately behind Skywalker's vessel on a landing platform. As a greeting party arrived to welcome the ''Mynock''{{'s}} crew, the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Shado Vao]] saw Marasiah and her companions depart their ship and drew his lightsaber. He and Skywalker engaged Draco and Krieg in a [[Skirmish at the Hidden Jedi Temple|duel]], and after a furious Skywalker Force-pushed the two Knights away, he realized that Rae had betrayed him and began shouting at her. Marasiah asserted that the Imperial Knights were on a diplomatic mission and placed Rae within its safe conduct, and as tensions began to die down, the Imperial delegation was brought to see the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi Council]]. Rae waited outside the [[Council Chamber (Hidden Temple)|Council Chamber]] under the supervision of Master [[Mai (Jedi)|Mai]] as Marasiah proposed to the council an alliance between the Jedi and her father's Empire, directed against Darth Krayt's forces.<ref name=\"Legacy 25\" />\n\nWhile Rae waited, she brought a cup of caf to Jariah Syn and apologized for betraying the ''Mynock''{{'s}} crew. Their subsequent conversation was interrupted by Rasi Tuum, who approached his former apprentice and hugged her. The two were both relieved to see the other alive. Tuum openly questioned Rae's loyalties,<ref name=\"Legacy 25\" /> [[Force sense/Legends|sensing]] that while her Imperial duty was clear to her mind, her [[Heart/Legends|heart]] yearned for the Jedi way. She left to consider his words and sought out Marasiah in the quarters that had been assigned to them. Marasiah, too, could sense Rae's conflict, and reminded her that the oaths she had sworn were lifelong. She also stressed that the [[Darth Havok|only Imperial Knight]] to have ever left the order had died soon after. While Rae struggled with her dilemma, the Jedi Council refused Skywalker's request for help in his mission to [[Assassin/Legends|assassinate]] Darth Krayt. He was determined to proceed without their assistance, however, and Marasiah assigned Rae, Draco, and Krieg to accompany him while she remained behind to continue negotiating with the Jedi. Skywalker's [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] opened the ''Mynock''{{'s}} cargo bay doors so that Draco and Krieg could load their [[Predator-class fighter|TIE predators]], and Skywalker grudgingly accepted the Imperial Knights' offer of assistance. Shado Vao joined the strike team as the Jedi's sole representative,<ref name=\"Legacy 26\" /> and the ''Mynock'' made its way to the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]].<ref name=\"Legacy 28\" />\n\n===Ambush in the Core===\n{{Quote|Cade, I see a way in! Can you hold off the Raks by yourself?''\"<br />\"''Do it! Quick! I'm sick and tired of these stoopa Raks!|Rae and Cade Skywalker during battle with Darth Krayt, immediately before Rae's critical strike on the Sith Lord|Legacy (2006) 31}}\nSkywalker formulated a [[Mission to Had Abbadon|plan]] to lure Krayt to the Deep Core world of [[Had Abbadon/Legends|Had Abbadon]]. ''En route'', Rae sat outside of his quarters while he meditated. She tried to apologize for using him to sneak her fellow Imperial Knights into the Hidden Temple and appealed to their childhood memories while seeking forgiveness. As she spoke to his door, the ship was drawn out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] by the [[Interdiction field/Legends|interdiction field]] of the Star Destroyer ''[[Iron Sun]]'', which [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Old Republic]] Jedi [[Celeste Morne]] had commandeered [[127 ABY|ten years before]] and kept dormant in the Deep Core. Skywalker emerged from the captain's quarters and accused Rae of interdicting them, and the two argued on their way to the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]]. No TIE predators or other ships came out of the Destroyer to meet them, and when the ''Mynock'' was locked in a [[Tractor beam/Legends|tractor beam]], Skywalker and Vao sensed the presence of a Force-user aboard the [[Warship/Legends|warship]]. The strike team set out to explore the derelict vessel, and Rae's party, including herself, Skywalker, Syn and Vao, found nothing but [[Bone/Legends|bones]] in the hangar bay. Draco and Krieg [[Comlink/Legends|commed]] Rae from adjacent corridors and reported similar discoveries, and as Rae's party mulled over their findings, a group of [[Rakghoul]] beasts emerged from a doorway and attacked them. Rae was scratched and Skywalker was bitten before Celeste Morne arrived and ordered the beasts to stop. She was able to control them with the power of the [[Muur Talisman]], an ancient [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith artifact]] that housed the [[Force ghost|spirit]] of the Sith Lord [[Karness Muur]].<ref name=\"Legacy 28\" />\n\n[[File:Welcometotheclub.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rae is infected with the Rakghoul plague.]]\nWhen she saw that Rae and Skywalker had been infected by the [[Rakghoul plague]], Morne Force-pushed them into a [[Prison/Legends|holding cell]] and shut a door to lock them away from Syn and Vao, hoping to keep Rae and Skywalker quarantined until the plague caused them to [[Mutant|mutate]] into Rakghouls. She told them that the plague had no cure and promised to quickly kill them after they transformed. While they waited for the metamorphosis to occur, Morne told them of her past and how she had come to wear the Muur Talisman in order to keep Karness Muur's spirit contained. Rae and Skywalker began bleeding, and Skywalker, desperate, asked Morne if the Rakghoul plague was a disease. When she replied in the affirmative, Skywalker grabbed Rae and called on his [[Dark transfer|healing powers]] to rid both of them of their ailment. Their minds flashed back to their youth together as energy surrounded them, and their disease vanished. Morne was impressed by Skywalker's use and control of the Force and she offered to join their strike team.<ref name=\"Legacy 28\" /> With a new passenger, the ''Mynock'' completed its journey to Had Abbadon, a planet that was under the control of Krayt's Empire.<ref name=\"Legacy 29\" />\n\nAt Had Abbadon's Imperial base, Draco, Krieg, and Vao fired on TIE pilots from their [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] as Rae, Skywalker, and Morne stormed the compound. Morne used the Talisman to turn the defending stormtroopers into Rakghouls, who attacked [[Darth Reave]], the base's commanding Sith. After being scratched, Reave fled, and a telekinetic push from Morne prevented Rae and Skywalker from pursuing him. She had decided to allow Reave to report to Krayt, hoping that the bait of the Muur Talisman would lure the Sith Lord into their trap. As the strike team prepared themselves for Krayt's arrival, Rae was approached by Krieg, and the two discussed romantic feelings that he had for her. The tender moment was interrupted by Draco, who had received new orders from their Emperor via the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]]: obtain the Muur Talisman. Rae thought that the Sith device was evil and stormed off, disgusted by the new orders.<ref name=\"Legacy 29\" />\n\nRather than let the Talisman corrupt her Emperor, she decided to destroy it by killing Morne, and approached Morne's quarters with a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] in hand. Skywalker met her outside of the door, however, and began teasing her when he caught wind of her intentions. A brawl erupted, and the two swung at each other with both fists and lightsabers. Rae re-asserted her position that Morne and the Talisman needed to be destroyed, but Skywalker calmed her down by catching hold of her and mentioning their romantic youth. Feelings came flooding back to both of them, and they kissed before retiring to the quarters of the base's former [[Commander/Legends|commander]] for more private intimacy. As they cuddled on a [[Couch/Legends|couch]] and reminisced, Karness Muur began [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathically]] speaking to them, and Skywalker left to confront Morne.<ref name=\"Legacy 29\" />\n\n[[File:AzlynShiak.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Rae stabs Krayt through the chest on Had Abbadon.]]\nMorne used Skywalker as additional bait and contacted Krayt, inviting the Sith Lord to Had Abbadon so that both Skywalker and the Talisman could heal him of a malady he had that was slowly killing him. Krayt arrived along with four of his most trusted Sith Lords: Darths [[Darth Stryfe|Stryfe]], [[Darth Wyyrlok (III)|Wyyrlok]], [[Darth Talon|Talon]], and [[Darth Maladi|Maladi]]. All of the Sith Lords save Wyyrlok confronted Morne and Skywalker, before Rae, Krieg, Draco, and Vao emerged from hiding, having managed to [[Force stealth|conceal themselves]] in the Force. The six members of the strike team [[Battle on Had Abbadon|attacked]] the Sith, aided somewhat by Morne's unpredictable [[Army/Legends|army]] of Rakghouls, who ended up cutting the Imperial Knights off from the battle. Adamant that Krayt needed to die, Rae tried to stop Draco from pursuing the Talisman, but was angrily Force-pushed away. Krieg then physically restrained Draco and bid him to go after the Talisman while he and Rae dealt with Krayt.<ref name=\"Legacy 30\">[[Legacy (2006) 30|''Legacy'' (2006) 30]]</ref> Rae and Krieg stood back-to-back as they made their way through the Rakghouls toward Krayt, who was [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|dueling]] Morne.<ref name=\"Legacy 31\">[[Legacy (2006) 31|''Legacy'' (2006) 31]]</ref>\n\nAs Morne distracted the Sith Lord, Rae saw an opportunity to attack, and tasked Skywalker with holding off the Rakghouls while she leaped at Krayt. Krayt was hurling [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] at his foe when Rae came from behind, [[Shiak|stabbing]] him through the chest. Morne hurled the weakened Krayt's lightning back at him, and both Rae and Krayt were electrocuted. Morne then Force-pushed the Dark Lord off of a cliff while Rae collapsed to the ground, badly burnt and on the brink of death. With the Sith force defeated, Skywalker freed Morne from Muur's influence by killing her and vanquished Muur's spirit by [[Shatterpoint/Legends|destroying]] the Talisman. Syn and Vao then noticed that Rae was still alive, and Skywalker attempted to [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] her with the Force. Upon discovering that her body was too damaged, he continued to pour Force energy into her as the strike team boarded the ''Mynock'' to go find a medical facility. Skywalker refused Krieg and Draco passage, however, as he knew that Draco had attempted to seize the Talisman for the Emperor.<ref name=\"Legacy 31\" /> The ''Mynock'' made a desperate flight to the planet [[Kiffex/Legends|Kiffex]], where Rawk and his family had been hiding since their brush with Krayt's Imperials.<ref name=\"Legacy 34\">[[Legacy (2006) 34|''Legacy'' (2006) 34]]</ref>\n\n===Another chance at life===\n{{Quote|Azlyn&hellip; Damn&hellip;''\"<br />\"''Yes, Cade&mdash;Damn ''you''!

While he poured Force energy into her, the ''Mynock'' crash-landed in the middle of a storm. Skywalker rushed onto the ground, handing Rae to Rawk and Droo and demanding that they heal her. He hurriedly told Droo, who was a [[Kiffar/Legends|Kiffar]] healer, that Rae wanted to live, and Droo brought Rae to the workroom of the family's [[Rawk compound|compound]]. Droo placed Rae in a [[Bacta tank/Legends|bacta tank]], but Rae resisted any further attempts to heal her. Droo was ready to let her die, but Rawk insisted on honoring their promise to Skywalker to keep her alive. The two thus reluctantly placed Rae in a full-body suit of life-preserving [[Armor/Legends|armor]]<ref name=\"Legacy 34\" /> that pumped [[Bacta/Legends|bacta]] around her and breathed for her, buying her time until a better solution could be found.<ref name=\"Legacy 35\" />\n\n[[File:AzlynthanksCade.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Devastated with her life-preserving armor, Rae attacks Skywalker on Kiffex.]]\nRae was furious that Skywalker had lied to Droo and attacked him when he returned to the Rawk compound from a night at the nearby [[Ven Karya Spaceport]]. She accused him of selfishly keeping her alive when she had wanted to die and tossed him around the room as she explained how trapped she felt inside the armor. Deliah Blue pulled a blaster on her as she choked Skywalker, and Rae, devastated, walked away, wanting nothing more than to leave the planet. She made her way to the [[Sheyf's Palace|Palace]] of the planet's [[Sheyf]] and stayed as a guest of Sheyf [[Zharia Vos]]. She was found there two days later by Ganner Krieg, who had been sent by the Emperor to retrieve her. Krieg brought her back to Bastion.<ref name=\"Legacy 35\" />\n\nIn the care of the Imperial Knights, Rae was fitted with new armor by [[Hogrum Chalk]], the [[master armorer]] of the order. The improved design resembled crimson [[Imperial Knight armor]] and negated the need for a helmet, as Chalk installed an artificial breathing system in the suit's neck. Some time after her return from Kiffex, Rae tested out her new armor's capabilities in a [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|sparring]] match with Krieg.

Fel and the Jedi had already made pacts with the [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]], and an agreement between the Empire-in-exile and the Jedi Order would solidify a greater [[Alliance (Second Imperial Civil War)|union]]. The Imperial Knights camped for the night on Agamar's [[Grass/Legends|grassy]] plains and awoke the next morning to meet with representatives from the Jedi, led by Master [[K'Kruhk]] and including Rasi Tuum. Everyone present disguised themselves as [[Agamarian]] [[Farm/Legends|farmers]],<ref name=\"Legacy 45\">[[Legacy (2006) 45|''Legacy'' (2006) 45]]</ref> and several of the Imperial Knights positioned themselves away from the meeting, pretending to work on a nearby field.<ref name=\"Legacy 45\" /><ref name=\"Legacy 46\">[[Legacy (2006) 46|''Legacy'' (2006) 46]]</ref>\n\nA formal alliance was struck, and Fel declared Bastion a safe haven for both the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance, but the parleying was quickly interrupted by an approaching intruder riding a [[Agamarian beast|local animal]]. Masters Krieg and [[Sigel Dare]] began firing at the animal with [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifles]] until Fel recognized the rider as [[Morrigan Corde|Nyna Calixte]], the [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] for Krayt's Empire who had held the same title under Fel's leadership prior to the conclusion of the Sith&ndash;Imperial War. Calixte hurriedly told the assembled party that the Sith were aware of the meeting and had [[Operation: Thunderstroke|sent]] a [[First Sith Imperial Strikeforce|task force]] under the command of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Rulf Yage]] to capture or kill the Emperor. As the task force, led by the [[Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer|''Pellaeon''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[War Hammer]]'', engaged Fel's [[Dauntless (Pellaeon-class)|''Dauntless'']] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]], she suggested that the Imperial Knights and Jedi run if they wanted to survive.<ref name=\"Legacy 45\" />\n\n[[File:IKAgamar1-L46.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Rae, Marasiah Fel, and Rasi Tuum battle Sith on Agamar.]]\nThe Imperial Knights and Jedi were quickly advanced upon by a group of Sith emerging from nearby swamps. Antares Draco and K'Kruhk called on their respective parties to defend Emperor Fel, and all disguises were shed as a battle ensued. Rae and Tuum fought side-by-side in an effort to protect [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] Marasiah, and at least ten Sith fell to the blades of the Imperial Knights and Jedi, as well as to Calixte's blaster. When the escape shuttle ''[[Defender One]]'' landed near the site of the melee in order to evacuate the Emperor, all of the surviving Imperial Knights and Jedi boarded, save for Rae, Marasiah, and Tuum, who were too far away. An explosion from the [[Laser/Legends|blasts]] of incoming TIE predators propelled the three further away from the shuttle,<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" /> knocking them [[Sleep/Legends|unconscious]].<ref name=\"Legacy 49\">[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]]</ref> ''Defender One'' lifted off to protect the Emperor and escaped the planet, leaving Rae, Marasiah, and Tuum at the mercy of Krayt's Imperials.<ref name=\"Legacy 46\" />\n\nWhile Rae and Tuum lay unconscious, Marasiah was taken by the Sith. They awoke, severely injured, and found that the princess was missing.<ref name=\"Legacy 49\" /> Three days after the battle, they came across a grounded [[Sith&ndash;Imperial attack ship|attack ship]] being used by [[Bokar]] and [[Yuln]], two Sith who were searching the area for any survivors. When the Sith returned to their ship, Rae and Tuum ambushed them and struck them dead. Although Tuum wanted to return to Bastion, Rae insisted that they try to rescue the princess. Tuum obliged,<ref name=\"Legacy 48\">[[Legacy (2006) 48|''Legacy'' (2006) 48]]</ref> and the two piloted the attack ship to the Sith&ndash;Imperial fleet in orbit, where they sensed that Marasiah was being held. Their attempts to infiltrate the ''War Hammer'' failed when they discovered that the attack ship's docking codes were no longer valid, and they were forced to flee into hyperspace from pursuing Imperial attack craft.<ref name=\"Legacy 49\" />\n\nThe two returned to Bastion and made it past the planet's [[Mine/Legends|mines]] when they transmitted proper clearance codes. Their approach nevertheless set off alarms, and a group of Imperial Knights and Jedi rushed onto a landing platform to find that a Sith attack ship was making planetfall. Rae contacted Ganner Krieg on his personal comlink, which prevented Bastion's [[Artillery/Legends|artillery]] batteries from firing upon her craft as it landed. When she disembarked, Rae was seized by a frantic Antares Draco, who demanded to know where Marasiah was. She related her story, but he continued to accost her, claiming that she should have died rather than return home without the princess. Tuum's attempts at intervention led to him being Force-pushed across the landing platform, but the confrontation was halted by Hogrum Chalk, who informed the Imperial Knights present that they were needed in the Emperor's [[Roan Fel's quarters|quarters]]. Therein, Fel worried that his daughter knew all of the Empire's codes and gave Draco three hours to form a plan to rescue her.<ref name=\"Legacy 49\" />\n\n===United front===\n{{Quote|This way, Azlyn!''\"<br />\"''With you, Ganner!|Krieg and Rae, while defending the Hidden Temple|Legacy\u2014War 3}}\nDraco, Krieg, and Shado Vao were able to [[Mission to Korriban (Second Imperial Civil War)|extract]] Marasiah from the Sith world [[Korriban]], but Draco was captured by the Sith in the process.<ref name=\"Legacy 50\">[[Legacy (2006) 50|''Legacy'' (2006) 50]]</ref> After Marasiah's return to Bastion, her father hosted a [[Imperial Knight remembrance ceremony|remembrance ceremony]] honoring Draco and the Imperial Knights who had fallen on Agamar.

Rae, Vao, and Krieg met with Draco and Skywalker after the ''Mynock'' made planetfall and brought their broken comrade before the Princess. Rae and Krieg watched as she berated Draco for sacrificing his honor and yet offered him the chance to redeem himself by aiding in the inevitable defense of the Temple from Krayt's Empire.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 3]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Justdroppingintosayhello.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker's strike team arrives at their target during the Battle of Coruscant.]]\nSkywalker and his uncle concocted a plan to stand firm and lure Krayt's forces into the Temple, which would allow the fleets of both Fel's Empire and the Galactic Alliance to emerge from hyperspace behind them and seal their [[Imperial Navy/Legends|naval]] forces in a trap. When the [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|attack]] came, Skywalker and the four present Imperial Knights stood with the Jedi and defended the Temple's outer portal from a group of attacking Sith. Rae and Krieg fought side-by-side as they cut down the invaders. \"Bantha\" Rawk, who had reactivated as a Jedi, soon contacted the Galactic Alliance and Empire-in-exile fleets, who arrived in the [[Star system/Legends|system]] to spring their trap.<ref name=\"Legacy War 3\" /> As the [[Space warfare|space battle]] raged, Rae and Krieg cooperatively downed an Imperial [[Walker/Legends|walker]] that marched towards the Temple. When Krayt's secret army of [[Darth Krayt's Sith trooper|Sith troopers]] arrived in-system, a group of them surrounded the defenders, who had been pushed back to the Temple's council chambers. The Skywalkers and [[Drok|three]] [[Sayar Dun'La|additional]] [[Te Corso|Jedi Masters]] remained there to defend Master [[T'ra Saa]], who was using [[Battle meditation]] to coordinate the allied forces, while Rae and the others retreated. The starships that composed the Hidden Temple then rose into the sky and were able to flee the system under the protection of a blast of [[Beam of light|Force energy]] that rose with them, and of several ships that defected from Krayt's Empire during the battle. After having taken heavy losses from the Sith troopers, the surviving allies retreated to Bastion.<ref name=\"Legacy War 4\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 4]]''</ref>\n\nThree days after the fall of the Hidden Temple, the Emperor, along with Admiral [[Gar Stazi]] of the Galactic Alliance and the surviving members of the Jedi Council, decided to mount an [[Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)|offensive]] against Coruscant before Krayt and his Sith troopers could strike at Bastion. Along with Masters Krieg and Dare, Rae joined a [[Cade Skywalker's strike team|strike team]] whose goal was to infiltrate the planet in advance of the attack and disable the central [[Computer/Legends|computers]] that controlled the planet's orbital defenses. Morrigan Corde, a recent defector from Krayt's Empire who had also worn the hat of Director of Imperial Intelligence as her alter ego Nyna Calixte, led the team; it also included Skywalker, Vao, Sazen, and Tuum. Syn and Blue brought the them to Coruscant in the ''Mynock'' and covertly landed them at a hidden location; the strike team arrived at their target two [[Standard minute/Legends|minutes]] before the allied fleets were set to arrive in-[[Coruscant system/Legends|system]]. Rae and Tuum used telekinesis to blast several technicians away, and as the group fought off stormtroopers and Sith troopers, Krieg, Vao, and Skywalker destroyed the computers and brought Coruscant's defenses down.<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 5]]''</ref>\n\nThe group's next destination was the [[Temple of the Sith]], where they hoped to locate Krayt and force him into a showdown with Skywalker. They entered using secret tunnels that Skywalker and Vao had discovered years before when it had been the Jedi Temple, but Darth Talon and Darth Stryfe were waiting for them along with several other Sith. A fierce skirmish erupted that saw Master Dare stabbed in the chest, as well as a confrontation between Sazen and Stryfe that ended both warriors' lives. Rae stood with Krieg and fought on as Skywalker penetrated deeper into the temple,<ref name=\"Legacy War 5\" /> where he found and killed Krayt. As the Sith troopers' wills were linked to the Dark Lord through the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], they all went insane, and the ones in combat with the strike team were promptly cut down. The Sith trooper-piloted [[Annihilator-class starfighter|''Annihilator''-class starfighters]] in the space battle above crashed onto Coruscant's surface, and Krayt's fleet fled into hyperspace. The capital belonged to the allies, and the Sith went into hiding&mdash;the war was over. One of the battle's casualties was Emperor Fel, who had fallen to the dark side and attempted to release a Sith-created [[Omega Red|pathogen]] onto Coruscant that would kill every living thing onworld. He had then been slain by Draco, as every Imperial Knight had taken a vow to end the Emperor's life if he were ever to stray from the light. Rae was one of many in attendance at [[Funeral of Roan Fel|Fel's funeral]] in the war's immediate aftermath; Master Chalk delivered a eulogy and announced the formation of a [[Galactic Federation Triumvirate]]: Admiral Stazi, Jedi Master K'Kruhk, and the newly-crowned Empress Marasiah, who would unify the galaxy.<ref name=\"Legacy War 6\">''[[Legacy\u2014War 6]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Let me go, Cade.

Seven years after the Jedi were scattered by Darth Krayt's Sith, Rae re-encountered the remnants of the Order and began longing for the way of the Jedi. Her conflicted heart was palpable in the Force and able to be sensed by her former Master, Rasi Tuum. Although she yearned for her past, Rae was mindful of the oaths she had sworn to Emperor Fel as an Imperial Knight. Her duty to the Emperor was clear to her mind, if not to her heart,<ref name=\"Legacy 26\" /> and she felt a debt of gratitude to the Imperial Knights for taking her in and completing her training.<ref name=\"Legacy 28\" /> Rae felt severely conflicted while at the Hidden Temple and considered the possibility of abandoning her oaths and rejoining the Jedi.<ref name=\"Legacy 26\" /> Ultimately, she chose to remain with the Imperial Knights.<ref name=\"Legacy 49\" />\n\nOn an undercover mission for Emperor Fel, Rae willingly deceived and earned the trust of Cade Skywalker, her childhood friend, when she was reunited with him after seven years of estrangement.<ref name=\"Legacy 24\" /><ref name=\"Legacy 25\" /> When Skywalker realized her duplicity and berated her for it, she began to feel remorse,<ref name=\"Legacy 25\" /> thinking that their past together should have garnered him respect and honesty on her part. Although she had believed him to be dead and had tried to forget about him, Rae had always loved Skywalker, and he her. The Imperial Knight Ganner Krieg also had feelings for Rae, and although she cared for Krieg too, she believed that their duties as Imperial Knights would always take them down separate paths.<ref name=\"Legacy 29\" />\n\n[[File:Nowwaitjustaminute.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Azlyn Rae believed that the Muur Talisman was evil, and refused to comply with her Emperor's order to obtain it.]]\nThe Imperial Knights served the Force as embodied by their Emperor, and Rae adamantly believed that their Emperor should never ask them to do anything dishonorable. She was disgusted when he ordered them to obtain the Muur Talisman, which she saw as an object of pure evil. She hated anything that was associated with the Sith and was uncomfortable with the fact that the Talisman had transformed stormtroopers into Rakghouls, even if they served Darth Krayt's Empire. Believing that the Talisman was incredibly dangerous, Rae was prepared to kill Celeste Morne, the wearer of the Talisman, in cold blood in order to destroy it.

The effort nearly killed her,<ref name=\"Legacy 31\" /> and while she lay on the brink of death, she was content with the thought that her actions had saved the galaxy. She asked Skywalker to let her die and become one with the Force, and resisted all efforts to heal her.<ref name=\"Legacy 34\" /> She hated the suit of life-preserving armor that she was subsequently placed in and accused Skywalker of keeping her alive for selfish reasons.
