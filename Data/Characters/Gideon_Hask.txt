First in his class at Coruscant Imperial University. Served with valor aboard the ''Mandate'', receiving a battlefield promotion and the Crimson Star for exceptional performance against the enemy.|Admiral Garrick Versio|Battlefront II: Inferno Squad}}\n'''Gideon Hask''', nicknamed \"'''Gid''',\" was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Homeworld|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Kuat]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War]], Hask served as a [[soldier]] and [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] before joining the ranks of [[Inferno Squad]]&mdash;an [[Special forces|elite]] [[commando]] [[Squad|unit]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. After witnessing the destruction of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] at the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], Hask and his team were reassigned to [[Operation: Cinder]], a [[Contingency|plan]] devised by [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] to [[Climate disruption array|devastate]] several worlds in the event of his [[death]]. His support for the late Emperor's plan brought Hask into direct [[Skirmish on Vardos|conflict]] with his teammates, [[Commander]] [[Iden Versio]] and [[Del Meeko]], both of whom [[Inferno Squad (Resistance)|defected]] to the [[New Republic]] as a result of the execution of Operation: Cinder on [[Vardos]]&mdash;a planet noted for its loyalty to the Empire. Promoted to the [[Military rank|rank]] of Commander by [[Admiral]] [[Garrick Versio]], Iden's [[Parent|father]], Hask supported the Imperial forces led by [[Counselor to the Empire|Counselor]] [[Gallius Rax]] against the [[New Republic Defense Force|forces]] of the Republic at the [[Battle of Jakku]] in [[5 ABY]]. Although Hask survived an encounter with his former commanding [[officer]], the Empire was ultimately defeated and compelled to [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|capitulate]] to the Republic, ending the war as well as the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the Empire.\n\nIn the [[Standard year|years]] that followed the [[Galactic Concordance|conclusion]] of the [[The galaxy|Galactic]] Civil War, Hask went on to become an [[First Order officer|officer]] of the [[First Order]], a [[First Order military|military]] junta founded in the [[Unknown Regions]] by a group of Imperials who rejected the war's outcome and the subsequent [[New Republic Era|rise]] of the New Republic. In addition to serving as commander of the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Retribution]]'' by [[34 ABY]], he was also a participant in [[Project Resurrection]]&mdash;a clandestine operation which aimed to conscript [[Youngling|children]] for the purpose of training them to become [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]]. In the same year, the Republic [[capital]] world of [[Hosnian Prime]] was [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroyed]] by the First Order's [[Starkiller Base|Starkiller]] [[superweapon]], although Hask was killed shortly afterward during a final [[Skirmish on the Retribution|confrontation]] between himself and Iden Versio.\n\n==Biography==\n===In the Empire===\n{{Quote|Here's to Inferno Squad. May we live up to our name.|Gideon Hask|Spark of Hope}}\nA [[Homeworld|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Kuat]], Hask was orphaned at ten years old, when a [[Unidentified rebel infiltrator|rebel infiltrator]] [[Bombing at the Kuat shipyards|detonated]] a bomb within the [[Kuat]] [[Kuat shipyards|shipyards]]. Following this, Hask's new legal [[Gideon Hask's legal guardian|guardian]], who felt school was an acceptable substitute for [[parent]]s, enrolled him at the [[Future Imperial Leaders Military Preparatory School]] on the planet [[Vardos]] in the [[Jinata system]]. Hask later studied at the [[Royal Imperial Academy|Coruscant Imperial University]], where he came to know [[Iden Versio]], a fellow student with whom he developed a healthy sense of competition. By the time of his graduation, Hask had risen to the top of his class.<ref name=\"Inferno Squad\" />\n\n[[File:ToVictory-SoH.png|thumb|left|250px|Hask toasts to Inferno Squad's victory.]]\nAfter leaving the [[Imperial Academy]], Hask eventually came to serve aboard the ''[[Mandate]]'' and earned the [[Crimson Star]] for exceptional performances against his enemies along with a promotion. After the [[Battle of Yavin]], Hask, along with [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Iden Versio]], [[Del Meeko]] and [[Seyn Marana]], was drafted into [[Inferno Squad]], a [[Imperial Special Forces|Special Forces]] unit in the [[Imperial Military]], by [[Admiral]] [[Garrick Versio]]. Hask participated in Inferno's first [[Infiltration of the Dreamers|mission]]: to infiltrate and destroy the [[Dreamers]], which was a success, though it also brought the [[death]] of Marana.<ref name=\"Inferno Squad\" />\n\nHask went on to participate with Inferno in conducting special operations throughout the [[Galactic Civil War]], and, in [[4 ABY]], he commanded the [[Corvus (Raider II-class)|''Corvus'']] while Iden went on important [[Escape_from_the_Invincible_Faith|infiltration mission]] and he arrived to extract her and he then fought at the [[Battle of Endor]], which saw the death of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and the destruction of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], however Inferno Squad all made it out alive. Hask flew alongside Iden at the [[Battle of Fondor (Galactic Civil War)|battle]] of [[Fondor]], fighting against a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] attack on [[Moff]] [[Raythe]], whose [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] transported [[satellite]]s to be used as part of [[Operation: Cinder]]. In the battle he and Iden played a crucial role in ensuring an imperial victory and the safety of the sattelites and the Dauntless as well as leaving the rebel cruiser vulnerable to attack . However, when this [[climate disruption array]] attacked the [[Versio family|Versio]] homeworld of [[Vardos]], Iden and Meeko both went rogue, though Hask remained loyal to the Empire, succeeding in their original mission to extract [[Protectorate (title)|Protectorate]] [[Gleb]] to Admiral Versio, who promoted Hask to [[Commander]].<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\nWhile Iden and Meeko reformed [[Inferno Squad (Resistance)|Inferno Squad]] in the [[New Republic]], Hask continued to serve Admiral Versio and the shattering Empire in the last year of the Galactic Civil War. Promoted to [[commander]], Hask oversaw fueling operations on [[Chinook Station]] at [[Bespin]] and evaded capture when Iden and Meeko undertook a [[Mission to Chinook Station|mission]] to the station. Hask went on to fight at the [[Battle of Jakku]], where he took to the skies in a [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE interceptor]] and engaged in a dogfight with Iden. Iden shot him down, however, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\nThe Empire went on to lose the battle and was forced to [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|surrender]] to the Republic and sign the [[Galactic Concordance]]. Secretly, however, a select group of [[Imperial officer]]s and loyalists were able to flee into the [[Unknown Regions]] of [[the galaxy]], Hask among them, as part of the secret [[Contingency]]. There, they formed the [[First Order]], and Hask became an [[First Order officer|officer]] within the new faction.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n===Member of the First Order===\n====Confronting Del Meeko====\n{{Quote|Yeah and you don't get to be brave! Because you are not a soldier anymore. Look at you, you're a coward. You traded in your weapon for what? Fatherhood? Hauling cargo on the ''Corvus''?

Hask [[Mission to Pillio (First Order)|confronted]] his former squad mate one last time before killing him personally. He ordered Protectorate Gleb to bury the bodies of Meeko and his crew, but to leave the ''Corvus'' alone, hoping to lure Iden into a trap and kill her as well.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n====Confronting Iden Versio====\n{{Quote|You see, Iden. I hope you appreciate&hellip; That today, of all days&hellip; I chose to be here with you. In the place where you took everything from me. Yes, our squad, my family. And I've waited a long time&hellip; To return the favor. First, with Del, yes but&hellip; And now&hellip; With your daughter. [&hellip;] I had to live in ''your'' galaxy, Iden, now it's your turn to live in ''mine''.|Hask enacts his revenge on his former commanding officer and friend|Star Wars Battlefront II}}\nSometime later, [[Resistance]] member and friend of Iden, [[Shriv Suurgav]], found the ''Corvus'' empty. Concerned by this, he contacted Iden. After they seemingly found out Del was on Vardos being held by Gleb, they returned there to find him and Gleb, but when they arrived, they found Gleb had been executed by Hask and the First Order. Hask later revealed to them that he killed Meeko in revenge for when he and Iden defected thirty years prior. He then ordered the ''Corvus'' destroyed in an attempt to kill Iden and Del's daughter, [[Zay Versio]], but Zay had survived in an escape pod. He then ordered to have Vardos burned and have Iden and Shriv interrogated for information on the [[Resistance]] and then executed, but a battle erupted between J-Sec and First Order forces.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n====Final moments====\n{{Dialogue|Zay Versio|Let go!|Iden Versio|No!|Gideon Hask|That's the Iden I remember. Bold. Unpredictable! Use your weapon. Come on, use your weapon!|attr=Gideon Hask holding Zay Versio at gunpoint|src=Star Wars Battlefront II}}\nHask returned to the ''[[Retribution]]'', but Iden, Zay, and Shriv followed him in stolen TIE fighters. They boarded the ship just as it entered hyperspace and went to destroy the hyperdrive with charges. Predicting this, Hask snuck up on them and held Zay at gunpoint just as she had armed the last charge, and began taunting Iden to shoot him, but she dropped her weapon as she didn't want to risk hitting Zay. Disappointed in her cowardice, he berated her and aimed his pistol to kill her, but Zay broke free of Hask's grip and tossed a blaster to Iden, who shot him off the catwalk and down into the pit of the hyperdrive core, killing him.\n\n===Aftermath of his death===\nIden and Zay succesfully pulled the Star Destroyer from hyperspace, stopping it from defending Starkiller Base. They also retrieved schematics for a First Order [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|dreadnought]] that could be brought to the Resistance. However, Hask did leave Iden fatally wounded, and she died shortly after him, leaving Zay and Shriv alone to take the stolen plans to [[D'Qar]].<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Scourge-XWM.png|thumb|left|250px|Hask piloting a TIE/LN starfighter in battle for the Empire]]\nUnlike the rest of his comrades in Inferno Squad, because of the tragic events that happened to his family when he was still but a small boy, Gideon Hask was completely devoted to the Galactic Empire and later the First Order, thinking the Rebels as traitors to the Empire and never once questioning the intentions of both factions. He enjoyed killing rebels, as shown on multiple occasions where he disobeyed orders to do so. However, as an Imperial he was not remorseless and was saddened when he thought Iden had died on the Death Star and later worried on Fondor when Iden was almost sucked into space. He also admired stormtroopers and said that they had discipline and fearlessness. However, he had no problem with the Empire attacking the loyal world of Vardos. Also following Iden and Del's \"betrayal\" and defection to the Rebellion, he did not hesitate to hunt and kill either of them. As a First Order officer, he did not have any problem kidnapping children. When he discovered Del three decades later, he had been disillusioned by Del and his wife's weakness after the Galactic Civil War and was willing to make sure that they both paid the price for betraying the Empire at all cost. He willingly murdered Gleb for falling behind with Project Resurrection. He even joked about it later and enjoyed watching the destruction of the New Republic capital. He enjoyed making Iden watch her daughter seemingly die on the ''Corvus''. He taunted Iden to shoot him in their final confrontation and insulted her for not shooting him as he was holding her daughter.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGideon Hask was portrayed by [[Paul Blackthorne]] in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|soundcat=Audio files of Gideon Hask|imagecat=Images of Gideon Hask}}\n*''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: Starfighter Missions]]''\n*''[[Battlefront II: Inferno Squad]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Battlefront II: Inferno Squad (audiobook)|''Battlefront II: Inferno Squad'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Star Wars: Squadrons]]'' {{Hologram}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|177|Heading into Battle}}\n*{{InsiderCite|177|The Fist of the Empire}}\n*{{FFGXW2|Galactic Empire Conversion Kit|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Gideon_Hask_(TIE/ln_Fighter)|cardname=Gideon Hask}} {{C|Reissued in ''[[TIE/ln Fighter Expansion Pack]]''}}\n*{{Destiny|Spark of Hope|cardname=Gideon Hask|link=https://swdestinydb.com/card/11021}}\n*{{Destiny|Spark of Hope|cardname=To Victory|link=https://swdestinydb.com/card/11029}}\n*{{FFGXW2|Xi-class Light Shuttle Expansion Pack|Xi''-class Light Shuttle Expansion Pack''|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Gideon_Hask_(Xi-class_Light_Shuttle)|cardname=Gideon Hask}}\n*''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''\n*{{BuildXWingCite|61|Creating a Starship Fleet|''Battlefront II'' &ndash; Playing the TIE Fighter Pilots}}\n*{{FFGXW2|Skystrike Academy Squadron Pack|link=https://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.fandom.com/wiki/Gideon_Hask_(TIE Interceptor)|cardname=Gideon Hask}}\n*{{Databank|agent-gideon-hask|Agent Gideon Hask|archiveurl=https://archive.is/ykaC1}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gideon Hask#kanon\n|es=Gideon Hask\n|fr=Gideon Hask\n|ja=\u30ae\u30c7\u30aa\u30f3\u30fb\u30cf\u30b9\u30af\n|pl=Gideon Hask\n|ru=\u0413\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e\u043d \u0425\u0430\u0441\u043a\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hask, Gideon}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Navy pilots of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Inferno Squad personnel]]\n[[Category:Kuati]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Officers of the First Order]]\n[[Category:Partisan members]]\n[[Category:Spies]]"}}}]}}}}
