She lived with her husband and children in an apartment on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. After her husband went to work as a [[Senate Guard/Legends|Guard]] for the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], Sula spent so much time alone with her children. She suffered so much from her husband's absence and aggression towards her son since he was not interested in his father's work.\n\nAfter the events surrounding Sagoro's case with [[Simon Greyshade/Legends|Simon Greyshade]], she separated from Sagoro and eventually moved with her children to [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]].\n\nNear the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Sula never got over the separation with her husband and was eventually reunited with him several weeks after the Republic was reformed into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] under the rule of [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Republic: Honor and Duty]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Jedi: Shaak Ti]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Republic 78|''Republic'' 78]] {{Hologram}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|sagoroautem|Autem, Sagoro|archivedate=20100830071222}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Sula Autem\n|pl=Sula Autem\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Autem, Sula}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
