During the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], the village where they lived was attacked by the [[Wyrd]], who killed everyone there. Tanora had been out looking for fruit, so was the only person from the village left alive. She knew vaguely where another irstat lived, so she set out to find them and warn them about the Wyrd.\n\nAfter several days alone in the jungle, Tanora became wounded and began to become malnourished. She was discovered by the [[heroes of Cularin]] and ran away from them, as she had never seen any offworlders before. They chased after her, eventually capturing her. After calming her down and giving her medical treatment, she explained to them what had happened to her irstat. The next day, she wished the heroes well and set off back into the jungle, to find to other irstat.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Hunting the Wyrd]]''\n\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tarasin]]"}}}]}}}}
