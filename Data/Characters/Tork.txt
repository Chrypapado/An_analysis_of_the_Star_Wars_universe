He often worked with [[Ackmena/Legends|Ackmena]] and [[Ackmena's sidekick|her assistant]].\n\nAs a bouncer, his job was to eject intoxicated customers who were causing trouble, or simply unwilling to leave after the bar was closed down. He was helped in this by his fierce appearance and his intimidating size (well over two meters tall). Though gruff, he was a close friend of Ackmena. Indeed, he, Ackmena, and Ackmena's assistant were almost like a family.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Unidentified_Neshtab_farmer.jpg|left|thumb|Tork from ''Yoda Stories''.]]\nTork was played by actor [[Mickey Morton]] in ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.<ref>{{Youtube|MNsvzX1bLr0|CANTINARCHEOLOGY PART 4 FORTY YEARS OF THE STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL|channel/UCHbe4j1R3pdtm-6HOEgmS4w|The Credible Nerds|archivedate=20190520130406}}</ref> The character also appears sporadically and randomly in the ambiguously [[canon]] game ''[[Star Wars: Yoda Stories]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{InsiderCite|131|Maze Run}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Yoda Stories]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|91|Refresher Reading}}\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Threat of the Conqueror|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Threat_of_the_Conqueror#Card_gallery|cardname=Feeling Lucky}} {{Po}}\n*{{InsiderCite|144|Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery: You're Barred!}}\n*{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-holiday-special-cantina-we-may-not-thrive-friend-but-we-survive-friend|text=''The Star Wars Holiday Special'' Cantina: Who's Who|int=The Star Wars Holiday Special Cantina: Who's Who}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|nl=Tork\n}}\n\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unidentified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Near-Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
