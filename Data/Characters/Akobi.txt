This was partly due to the fact that Imperial communications were being disrupted by the Rebels, but also because Akobi mistakenly thought he remembered the terrain. The Empire pushed the incident under the rug and declared him a hero. Shortly before his division was transferred, Akobi was nearly [[Death/Legends|killed]] by a bomb planted by the Rebels, but was again saved by 622.\n\nHis division's tour on Ralltiir complete, Akobi was transferred aboard the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]], where he was attacked by a [[RA-7 protocol droid/Legends|RA-7 droid]]. Only by TK-622's quick actions was his life saved. However, the saboteur Rebel agent [[Krono Relt]] was not finished with his victim. On his way to an awards ceremony, Akobi was attacked by a rogue [[Viper probe droid/Legends|Viper probe droid]], who severely electrocuted the Imperial.\n\nAkobi was taken to a medcenter, but was not expected to survive the week. Just before he died, he told his only friend, TK-622, the truth about the atrocities on Ralltiir. His body was destroyed when the Death Star's enormous reactor went critical.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Empire 13|''Empire'' 13]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{DB|character|akobi|Akobi, Commander|archivedate=20100210003628}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Akobi\n|es=Akobi\n|nl=Akobi\n|pl=Akobi\n}}\n\n[[Category:Death Star residents]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army officers of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ralltiiri]]"}}}]}}}}
