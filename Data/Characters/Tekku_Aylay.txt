After the Empire abandoned the [[planet]], Aylay thanked the resistance fighter [[Yendor]]&mdash;who had been part of [[Cham Syndulla]]'s [[Free Ryloth Movement]]&mdash;while others Twi'leks packed up the camps. The old man then declared they would need the help of the [[New Republic]] to maintain their freedom, and suggested that Yendor should be the world's [[ambassador]], much to the other Twi'lek's dismay.<ref name=\"LD\" /> Despite Yendor's objections to the idea, the resistance member had indeed become ambassador to the New Republic by the time of the [[Napkin Bombing]] incident on the New Republic [[capital]] [[Hosnian Prime]].<ref name=\"BL\">[[Bloodline (novel)|''Bloodline'']]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTekku Aylay first appeared in an interlude in the novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'', which was written by [[Chuck Wendig]] and released in [[2016]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Tekku Aylay\n|ru=\u0422\u0435\u043a\u043a\u0443 \u042d\u0439\u043b\u044d\u0439\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aylay, Tekku}}\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ryloth residents]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
