Born on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] around [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]], most of Dorvald's family was killed following the [[Yuuzhan Vong]]'s [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|invasion]] of the [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] [[Capital/Legends|capital]], and she was orphaned after the subsequent [[Death/Legends|death]] of her [[Seha Dorvald's father|father]] during the occupation. Dorvald remained in Coruscant's [[Coruscant underworld|undercity]] for the following two years of the war, emerging some time after the invaders had been [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|driven off]] the capital in [[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]]. With the end of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Dorvald met [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], a powerful Jedi and hero of the conflict, during one of his trips into the undercity. Solo found Dorvald to be strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], and introduced her into the [[New Jedi Order]]. Despite the fact that Dorvald was traditionally too old to begin [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]], Solo's sponsorship ensured that she was accepted into the Order.\n\nAs a form of repayment for Solo's aid, Dorvald would complete tasks at her sponsor's orders. In [[40 ABY]], Dorvald helped smuggle Solo's apprentice [[Ben Skywalker]] out of the [[New Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] on an unsanctioned mission for her sponsor. Following the revelation that Solo was a [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]], however, and having learned of [[Battle of Ossus (Second Galactic Civil War)|his invasion]] of the [[Jedi Academy (Ossus)|academies]] on [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]] and Coruscant, Dorvald came forward to the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] and confessed to helping Solo. In recompense, Dorvald volunteered to aid [[Kyle Katarn]], [[Valin Horn]], and [[Thann Mithric]] in their mission either to place a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing device]] on the Solo, capture him, or kill him. The result of the [[Undercity Ambush|mission]] was almost a failure, with the death of Mithric and the near-fatal wounding of Katarn, but Dorvald was able to complete the mission by rescuing Katarn and placing the homing device on Caedus before her escape. Dorvald survived the [[Second Galactic Civil War]] and was later apprenticed to [[Chandrilan/Legends|Chandrilan]] Jedi Master [[Octa Ramis]].\n\nIn [[43 ABY|43.5 ABY]], Dorvald and her master responded to the threat of [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Valin Horn]], who had been stricken with an [[Force psychosis|enigmatic illness]] which induced paranoid delusions. Horn went on a rampage across Coruscant; Dorvald and Ramis attempted to capture and detain the rogue Knight. Although their efforts were unsuccessful in themselves, Dorvald and her Master were able to delay Horn's escape, and he was later captured by [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. When [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Natasi Daala]] later sanctioned a [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]]-implemented [[Siege of the New Jedi Temple|siege]] of the Jedi Temple in response to the Order's refusal to relinquish custody of several other psychosis-afflicted Jedi Knights, Dorvald took part in the collective effort to locate previously unexplored exits. Hours of tedious exploration into the depths of the Temple finally bore fruit when Dorvald, along with Master Ramis, discovered that rodents sent by fellow Jedi [[Leia Organa Solo]] had made their way through the smallest of the building's crevices, carrying much-needed supplies and correspondence to the besieged Jedi. Dorvald was soon afterward promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and was an instrumental participant in the Jedi plot to [[Plan Delta|oust]] [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] Daala from the [[Office of the Chief of State|office]] of Chief of State, and the subsequent hunt for the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark-side]] entity known as [[Abeloth]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|I was little when the Yuuzhan Vong came to Coruscant. When the Vongforming happened. Most of my family died. I don't remember them, except my father. We lived in the undercity, so deep and out of touch that the Yuuzhan Vong had been driven offworld for months before I even learned about it.|Seha Dorvald|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nBorn circa [[22 ABY/Legends|22 ABY]] before the onset of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Seha Dorvald lived on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during her early childhood. She did not remember her family during her childhood; they were killed following the [[Yuuzhan Vong]]'s [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|invasion]] of Coruscant in [[27 ABY/Legends|27 ABY]]. Dorvald and her [[Seha Dorvald's father|father]] survived the attack, and he took her to the [[Coruscant underworld|Undercity]], on Coruscant's main surface, to hide for the remainder of the war before his [[Death/Legends|death]]. He was killed by a [[Yuuzhan Vong]] insect, leaving Dorvald orphaned. She would survive the rest of the war with several refugees she knew in the Undercity.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nAlthough she knew the war was over, Dorvald decided to stay in the Undercity with refugees after her father's death, as they were the only people she knew. For a while, Dorvald lived near the [[World Brain]], a [[dhuryam]], a Yuuzhan Vong creature which was responsible for the [[Terraforming/Legends|transformation]] of Coruscant from a [[Ecumenopolis/Legends|planetwide city]] into a hostile jungle. Dorvald was frightened of the creature due to its appearance; the ''dhuryam'' was a larger, more powerful form of a [[yammosk]], a brain-like creature with many tentacles and a single, large tooth that had coordinated attacks during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Dorvald then met the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] hero, [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], when he took a journey into the Undercity to meet the World Brain. Noticing her dislike of the World Brain, which Dorvald described as a horrible creature, he told her that what it looked like had nothing to do with its nature. Solo also noticed Dorvald's [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force potential]] and sponsored her admittance into the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]], even though she was considered too old to become an apprentice. Because of this, Dorvald felt indebted to Solo,<ref name=\"Fury\" /> whom she already found attractive,<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> and would often aid him by keeping him informed of events in the [[New Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]].<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n===Ally to a Sith===\n{{Quote|I did things for Jacen. Kept him updated on goings-on in the Temple. After he became the head of the Guard, he asked me to take things into and out of the Temple for him, like spare datapads, and replacement electronic components. When your son disappeared&hellip;I was the one who helped him get out of the Temple without being seen.|Seha Dorvald, to Luke Skywalker|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nBy [[40 ABY]], an [[Second Galactic Civil War|armed conflict]] had erupted between the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]], which the Jedi Order operated alongside, and a secessionist movement known as the [[Confederation]]. During the war, Dorvald served as a sentry at the entrance of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant at one point and had to deal with a visitor who claimed to be \"[[Twinsins Thlee]]\" and asked for a conversation with [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. After contacting Skywalker via [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], the Jedi Master told Dorvald that he would come to see Thlee&mdash;who was in fact the former [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Jagged Fel]]&mdash;and dismissed Dorvald after arriving at the entrance. Throughout the war, Dorvald continued to pass on information and carry out other tasks for Solo, who rose to the head of the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]]. Unbeknownst to Dorvald, her former sponsor had apprenticed himself to [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lady of the Sith]] [[Lumiya]], who was helping him take over the galaxy. Solo required a [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] apprentice of his own and sought to test [[Ben Skywalker]], a young Jedi who was several years younger than Dorvald. Dorvald's sponsor left the testing up to Lumiya, who disguised herself as Solo and issued Dorvald with a message that she was to deliver to Ben Skywalker. Furthermore, the young Jedi girl was then instructed to enable Skywalker to escape the Jedi Temple so that he could carry out his mission&mdash;to retrieve the [[Amulet of Kalara]] from [[Drewwa]]. While Ben Skywalker&mdash;the only son of Grand Master of the Jedi Order Luke Skywalker&mdash;was training in the Temple, Dorvald approached him and delivered the message. Once the first part of her assignment had been completed, the war orphan helped Skywalker escape without detection by opening up an secret passage, unknown to most of the Jedi, out of the Temple. Dorvald never knew she had been tricked by a Sith, though she would not unwittingly serve Lumiya much longer.<ref name=\"Exile\" />\n\nWhen Solo, who secretly became the Sith Lord [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Caedus after he [[Skirmish on Kavan|killed]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mara Jade Skywalker]], ordered his [[Troop/Legends|troops]] to seize the Jedi Temple on Ossus, Dorvald learned of the consequences of the occupation. Several Jedi were killed and [[Torture/Legends|tortured]], leading Dorvald to realize that she had allied herself to a man who had no qualms attacking the Order and its members. When Caedus' troops moved against the Temple on Coruscant, Dorvald was ready. So as to prevent the Galactic Alliance Guard from capturing vital records, Dorvald destroyed the Temple's [[Computer/Legends|computers]], while preserving a complete set of records and secreting them on her person. During the evacuation, the young Jedi girl saved two [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knights]] from death by leading them to safety through Coruscant's Underworld, using her knowledge of the pathways there. She then escaped to the forest [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], where the Jedi Order had convened following their schism with Caedus and the Galactic Alliance he now headed.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n===Mission to Coruscant===\n{{Quote|We'll all get out.''\"<br />\"''Girl, leave me&hellip;''\"<br />\"''I'm going to get you out alive.|Seha Dorvald and Kyle Katarn|Legacy of the Force: Fury}}\nWhen Grand Master Luke Skywalker, husband of the slain Mara Jade Skywalker, gave Jedi Master [[Kyp Durron]] the responsibility of planning a [[Undercity Ambush|mission]] to kill or capture Caedus, Durron was forced to search for a Jedi with knowledge of the Coruscant Undercity. His initial choice had been [[Zekk]], a former orphan who had, like Dorvald, grown up there. Durron later changed his mind when he realized that the team would need updated knowledge of Coruscant's underlevels, which had been drastically altered during the Yuuzhan Vong occupation. Dorvald was the prime candidate, and was called upon to meet with Grand Master Skywalker. Unwilling to live a lie, Dorvald confessed to him that she was a traitor to the Order. She told Skywalker about her past and how she helped Caedus; that she kept him updated on things going around in the Temple, smuggled things in and out for him, and that she helped Ben escape the Temple on Caedus's orders. Dorvald told Skywalker that she felt indebted to Caedus for sponsoring her to be in the New Jedi Order, and that it was the reason for her betrayal.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nAfter hearing her confession, Skywalker was hesitant in allowing Dorvald, who was only a Jedi [[Jedi Candidate|candidate]], to go on the mission, and he only conceded after he agreed that someone who knew the new Undercity was needed most for the mission. Dorvald was joined in her task by Jedi Master [[Kyle Katarn]] and Jedi Knights [[Valin Horn]]<ref name=\"Fury\" />&mdash;on whom Dorvald had an adolescent crush&mdash;<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> [[Thann Mithric]], and [[Kolir Hu'lya]]. The team traveled to Coruscant and infiltrated the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]], whereupon Dorvald successfully led her companions underneath the [[Senate Building]]. There, the team stayed for several hours; Dorvald led them through their entrance and exit routes over and over again, drilling the senior Jedi until they were confident of their chances of success. Once the impromptu training was complete, Dorvald took up position alongside Master Katarn, who tasked her with placing a [[Homing beacon/Legends|tracking device]] on Caedus during the chaos of the impending skirmish. Once this had been carried out, however, Katarn instructed Dorvald that she was to leave the fight immediately, regardless of whether the mission to eliminate the Sith Lord succeeded.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nA little before dawn, the four Jedi sprung their [[Undercity Ambush|trap]] while Dorvald stayed on position to observe the fierce [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber duel]] that ensued. During the duel, Dorvald [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinetically]] lifted the tracking device into the air toward the Sith Lord, waiting for the moment when the fight was at its most chaotic. Dorvald was initially impressed by the skill of the combatants as they dueled, but her excitement turned into horror when she saw Caedus [[Shiak|impale]] Katarn in the chest with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. Dorvald decided that it was the moment to place the tracking device onto Caedus, which she performed successfully, planting it on his cloak. The remaining Jedi continued to fight against their adversary while Dorvald used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to pull Katarn, who was still alive, out of harm's way. When the Jedi's previously planned airborne escape seemed impossible, Dorvald created an escape route by blowing up a hatch that was a few stories below from where they hid with explosives, and lowered herself and Katarn through the newfound path. The Jedi Master urged Dorvald to leave him to detonate the explosives while she fled, but the young girl refused. While Dorvald escaped with Katarn, however, Caedus killed Thann Mithric by [[Sai cha/Legends|decapitating]] the Falleen, finishing their duel.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\nAfter Mithric's death, Horn, Katarn, Hu'lya, and Dorvald escaped using the pathway Dorvald had created, and she led them through the undercity to a safehouse, which they used until they escaped from Coruscant. Although Katarn's condition worsened during the escape, the team returned safely to Endor. The mission, despite the injuries sustained and the loss of Mithric, had been successful. The Order was able to track Caedus as he moved around the galaxy, leading to further successful operations.<ref name=\"Fury\" /> In [[41 ABY]], the Second Galactic War was brought to a close with the death of Caedus during the [[Battle of Uroro Station|Battle of Shedu Maad]].<ref name=\"inv\">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref>\n\n===Rising tensions===\n{{Quote|But we lost. He got away.''\"<br />\"''We ''won''. He's in street clothes and his canopy isn't airtight. So he can't make space. And he's airborne, so his tracking device will give away his location continuously. We flushed him. Others will run him to ground.|Seha Dorvald and Octa Ramis discuss the pursuit of Valin Horn|Fate of the Jedi: Outcast}}\nSeha Dorvald remained with the Jedi Order and by [[43 ABY|43.5 ABY]] had been assigned as a [[Padawan/Legends|Jedi apprentice]] to [[Octa Ramis]], a [[Chandrilan/Legends|Chandrilan]] woman. Although still undertrained and lacking in confidence, Dorvald's skills had advanced in the years since her mission to Coruscant. Dorvald was stationed on the galactic capital when the Order received word that Valin Horn had undergone a psychotic break which led him to believe that he was surrounded by imposters who were conspiring against the galaxy. Horn became violent and embarked on a rampage as he attempted to escape Coruscant. The news saddened Dorvald, who realized that she had now had crushes on two Jedi who had acted against the traditions of the Order&mdash;first Jacen Solo, and now Valin Horn.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nDrawing on her prior experience with Horn, Dorvald convinced her master that they should lie in wait for the rogue Jedi Knight at the Senate Building. There, she expected Horn to revisit the hidden passages beneath the plaza through which she had led him several years before. Focusing on a tracking device, Dorvald grew increasingly frustrated as Horn failed to arrive at the plaza. Following a discussion with Ramis, during which she revealed her frustration with herself for falling for Jedi such as Solo and Horn, Dorvald was counseled by her master against withdrawing from her emotions. Moments later, the tracking device alerted the two Jedi to the presence of Valin Horn.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nTracking the rogue Jedi Knight into the Senate Building, Dorvald and Ramis were obstructed by a security guard who proved resistant to a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]]. The younger Jedi was able to sense Horn's elation as the Jedi Knight searched the Senate Building; combining her Force powers with Ramis she enabled her Chandrilan master to locate the rogue Jedi exactly. Ramis revealed that Horn was about to steal two vehicles; the first, a [[Kuat/Legends|Kuati]] [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]], Horn used to shatter the wall of Senate Building, granting him egress to fly out in an [[X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]]. As Horn [[Pilot/Legends|piloted]] the starfighter out of the Senate Building, Dorvald used telekinesis to boost Ramis onto the small craft. She watched as her Jedi Master stabbed a hole through the X-wing's canopy before being thrown off the starfighter into the air.<ref name=\"Outcast\" />\n\nDorvald reached out with telekinesis and slowed Ramis' descent. The Chandrilan woman hit the ground hard, but survived the impact. Master and apprentice halted their pursuit, with Ramis confident that Horn was no longer able to enter atmosphere in his damaged craft. Indeed, Grand Master Skywalker was able to incapacitate Horn personally and return the Jedi Knight to the [[Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center]] for study. Horn's inexplicable madness and subsequent rampage resulted in restrictions being placed on the Jedi Order by Galactic Alliance [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] [[Natasi Daala]],<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> an approach which developed further in subsequent weeks.<ref name=\"Omen\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Omen]]''</ref><ref name=\"Abyss\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Abyss]]''</ref>\n\n===A new hope===\n{{Quote|And if we can get medicines in, we might be able to get messages ''out''.''\"<br />\"''It's already in progress. Now come on. Let's get the vials off these little fellows and in the hands of Cilghal. And, let's get you a sanisteam.|Dorvald and Master Ramis, upon the discovery of Princess Leia's rodent couriers|Fate of the Jedi: Allies}}\nFollowing Valin Horn's descent into mental psychosis, several other Jedi succumbed to the same illness, forcing Chief of State Daala to demand their uncontested surrender to Coruscant authorities. When surrogate Jedi Grand Master [[Kenth Hamner]] refused to oblige, Daala contracted [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] commandos to [[Siege of the New Jedi Temple|lay siege]] to the Jedi Temple. All known exits, secret or otherwise, were blocked by Mandalorians, effectively trapping all of the Temple's occupants within. Seha Dorvald was present at the subsequent Council meeting that was called in response to Daala's action, where Master Ramis volunteered her services as well as those of Dorvald's in light of the latter's experience with working underground. The meeting also saw the selection of Master Hamner's assistant, Jedi apprentice [[Kani Asari]], to liaise with the leader of the Mandalorian siege force, [[Belok Rhal]]. Because Asari was neither [[Sothais Saar]] nor [[Turi Altamik]]&mdash;the two Jedi for whom Daala appealed&mdash;Rhal killed her with a close-range [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] shot. The Jedi were horrified by the unwarranted murder of one of their own. Dorvald and Ramis attempted to rouse Kenth Hamner into eating, but eventually left him to begin their task after the grief-stricken Master refused.<ref name=\"Allies\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]''</ref>\n\nSeven hours of tedious exploration yielded nothing save the discovery of numerous openings that were suited to accommodate neither Dorvald nor any of the six other apprentices assigned to assist her. As an exhausted, famished, and filthy Seha crawled back through a tunnel to report to her Master, she absentmindedly happened upon a dead rodent whose odor nearly caused Dorvald to vomit. Dorvald received a call via comlink from Master Ramis at that moment, inquiring as to whether or not she had taken notice of anything unusual. When she replied that she had not, Ramis told Dorvald to expedite her return, as the Jedi Master had made a discovery. She arrived to find Ramis beside shelves lined with numerous and different sized boxes, and over a trio of rodents of the same species as the corpse Dorvald had just encountered, each with something affixed to their backs. Ramis explained that there were many more of the creatures, and that they had suddenly appeared through every opening through which they could squeeze their bodies. Dorvald realized upon closer inspection that the vials being carried by the rodents contained the medicines that the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] [[Jedi healer/Legends|Jedi healer]] [[Cilghal]] required to treat the psychotic Knights, and also learned from Ramis that Master [[Corran Horn]] determined that someone had used the Force [[Animal bond|to compel]] the vermin into service. An idea dawned on Dorvald that if the creatures could bring supplies in, they could also carry messages to the outside as well. Master Ramis advised Dorvald that such plans were already under way and, as they both began collecting the vials in preparation for delivery to Cilghal, suggested that the girl take a [[Sanisteam/Legends|sanisteam]]. Not long afterward, however, the afflicted all abruptly recovered from their psychosis, resultant of the [[Mission to the Maw|efforts]] of exiled Grand Master Skywalker to defeat [[Abeloth]], the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] entity responsible for their hysteria.<ref name=\"Allies\" />\n\n===Knight of the Order===\n====Jedi coup====\n{{Quote|This is pilot Dorn.

Among the threats encountered by Skywalker in his travels was a new and previously-unrealized [[Lost Tribe of Sith|tribe]] of Sith,<ref name=\"Abyss\" /> with whom he was forced to ally in the pursuit of Abeloth,<ref name=\"Allies\" /> but had since betrayed him as he fled the [[The Maw|Maw Cluster]].<ref name=\"Vortex\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Vortex]]''</ref> Seha Dorvald was soon afterward promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and was influential in the Order's subsequent development of strategy to assist their beleaguered leader.<ref name=\"Conviction\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''</ref> A wing of Jedi [[StealthX]] starfighters had already been provisioned for departure, but had been hamstrung by the interference of the Galactic Alliance,<ref name=\"Backlash\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Backlash]]''</ref> a situation exacerbated by the ineffective leadership of Kenth Hamner, who had been [[Vote of No Confidence/Legends|removed]] from his seat as the remaining Councilors contrived to circumvent Alliance notice of their planned departure from Coruscant. A [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] [[Tendrando Arms Celebrity Sabacc Charity Challenge|tournament]] was hosted by Jedi supporter [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] for the well-to-do of the galaxy, including many high-ranking Alliance and Imperial government and military officials, aboard the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Errant Venture]]''. The [[Galactic Alliance Sixth Fleet]] was pressed into action when the ''Venture'' destroyed several of Coruscant's [[Orbital Solar Energy Transfer Satellite|orbital mirrors]] and then fled into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], thus providing a window of opportunity for the StealthX mission, of which Dorvald was apart, to commence. Kenth Hamner attempted to prevent their departure, but was slain in [[Skirmish in the Operations Hangar|combat]] with the [[Barabel/Legends|Barabel]] Master [[Saba Sebatyne]].<ref name=\"Vortex\" />\n\nThe Jedi traveled to the [[Almanian system|Almanian]] moon of [[Pydyr]], where Dorvald shuttled EV pilots in a [[Starfighter combat/Legends|space battle]] against the Sith.<ref name=\"Vortex\" /> With her recoveries delivered to the ''Errant Venture'', which also served as the StealthX staging ground, Dorvald assumed control of the [[Transport/Legends|transport]] vessel ''[[Dust Dancer]]'', one loaded with a wealth of excess provisions from the sabacc tournament, and piloted the vessel to the planet [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]], where she unloaded her cargo in preparation for the next phase of the Jedi's plan: infiltration of the [[Senate Building]] on Coruscant. To that end, all dignitaries with business on the galactic capital were loaded onboard the ''Dust Dancer'', only to be transferred to the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class shuttle]] ''[[DeepRay]]'', which Dorvald&mdash;newly-disguised and aliased as \"Sela Dorn\"&mdash;piloted back to the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core]]. Upon their arrival, Dorvald seduced [[Galactic Alliance Security]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Javon Thewles]] into allowing her a longer-than-permissible berthing in the Senate hangar. Twenty four hours was sufficient time for Dorvald to smuggle supplies, as well as Masters Kyp Durron and Octa Ramis, both of whom had stowed away in smuggling compartments of the ''Dust Dancer'', into the heart of the government, as sleeper agents to be activated when the Jedi executed [[Plan Delta]]: the removal of Chief of State Daala from office.<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\nThe actions of Dorvald were ultimately discovered by Chief Daala, who was under the false impression that the undercover Jedi had poisoned Alliance [[General/Legends|General]] [[Merratt Jaxton]], and also Imperial [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Drikl Lecersen]], then infiltrated the Senate Building in attempt to do further harm to members of the Senate. Her arrest was demanded by Daala, and Dorvald agreed to submit herself to the justice of the Galactic Alliance at the behest of fellow Jedi Knight [[Leia Organa Solo]]. Her transfer of custody only served as the next phase of Plan Delta, however; the [[C-class VoxPop advocate droid]] Dorvald was accompanied by when she ventured to the Senate Building to turn herself in was laden with hidden cameras that recorded everything&mdash;including the entire layout of the building interior, specifically its detention wing. While in custody, she was visited by Lieutenant Thewles, who had also been detained by his very employers under suspicion of complicity in Dorvald's supposed crimes. She denied any involvement despite his repeated attempts to determine the truth, and instead accused Thewles of being sent by his superiors to coax a confession out of her. Her actions, however, had resulted in all but the lieutenant's termination, and he assured the Jedi that his interests were his own, since he had already submitted his resignation from Alliance Security.<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\nSoon afterward, a [[Klatooinian/Legends|Klatooinian]] [[Terrorist/Legends|terrorist]] named [[Grunel Ovin]] was captured and brought to Coruscant, only to destroy the [[CC-7700 frigate/Legends|CC-7700 frigate]] ''[[Fireborn]]'' in the planet's orbit. In response, the Chief of State ordered the eradication of the gathering of freedom fighters on [[Klatooine/Legends|Klatooine]] by way of the Mandalorians, and the Jedi immediately executed Plan Delta in an attempt to prevent the Daala-sanctioned genocide. Dorvald was rescued by apprentice [[Bandy Geffer]] and led to the building's armory as the Jedi launched a precision-strike against the Office of the Chief of State and secured the Senate Building. She deflected blaster bolts from members of the Coruscant Security Force while Geffer cut an entrance into the armory. Both donned gas masks and proceeded to hurl [[Gas grenade|grenades]] down the corridor toward their attackers.<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\nThe Jedi eliminated Daala, and thereby prevented a potential massacre on Klatooine. In the interim, a [[Triumvirate (Galactic Alliance)|Triumvirate]] was installed to serve as the executive branch of government, during the subsequent investigation into misconduct of the Office of the Chief of State. Among the concessions granted was the exoneration of Seha Dorvald. While her own freedom had been returned to her, she could not help but feel slightly responsible for the disgraced Lieutenant Thewles. She recommended him to Jedi Organa Solo, for whom Thewles was hired as elite security for their adopted daughter, [[Allana Solo|Amelia]].<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\n====Hunting Abeloth====\nThe disgrace of Daala also resulted in the overturned conviction of Grand Master Skywalker, who returned to Coruscant and resumed leadership of the Jedi Order after he failed to eliminate both the Lost Tribe of Sith and Abeloth. Seha Dorvald was part of the security detail that monitored surrounding activity during the ceremony in which Skywalker announced a formal disassociation with the Galactic Alliance and withdrawal of representation in the recently-formed Triumvirate. In coincidence with the Order's declared autonomy, the Grand Master also revealed the immediate departure of the Jedi from Coruscant. Dorvald was counted in the Jedi fleet that then resumed the pursued of Abeloth across the galaxy. The search [[Mission to Upekzar|led]] to the ancient Sith world of [[Upekzar]], where the Jedi walked into a trap laid by Abeloth, one that resulted in a massive explosion of dark side energy and the deaths of several Jedi that were unable to escape the blast radius. Dorvald, however, was among the survivors.<ref name=\"Ascension\">''[[Fate of the Jedi: Ascension]]''</ref>\n\nDorvald was also a part of the team tasked with assassinating Sith High Lord Ivaar Workan, along with Luke and Ben Skywalker, Vestara Khai, and Doran Tainer. Upon entering the scene and seeing Ben and Vestara standing over the bodies of several Sith, Tainer and Dorvald were shocked at what the duo had accomplished without bringing any weapons with them. Throughout the rest of the Liberation of Courascant, Dorvald served alongside the rest of the Jedi and was a valuable asset.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|You're not calm, Seha.''\"<br />\"''I know, Master.|Octa Ramis and Seha Dorvald|Fate of the Jedi: Outcast}}\nBy nature a shy, red-haired girl, Seha Dorvald suffered problems with confidence in her early years.<ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Outcast\" /> Orphaned at a young age, she was taken in by Solo and sponsored for entrance into the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"Fury\" /> Dorvald lagged behind her fellow Jedi despite her advanced age, and was lacking in confidence while she was in her early twenties.<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> Timid around figures of seniority, especially those Jedi Masters to whom she had to admit her secret work for Jacen Solo,<ref name=\"Fury\" /> Dorvald had limited self-esteem; when Jacen Solo and later Valin Horn&mdash;both Jedi whom Dorvald found attractive&mdash;each turned from the Jedi ways, the young Coruscanti felt frustrated with herself for falling for such men.<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> She was more comfortable in situations in which she was familiar, such as when she led senior Jedi through training in the undercity,<ref name=\"Fury\" /> and had fewer problems flirting with the younger Ben Skywalker in the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Exile\" /> She grew into an exquisitely attractive young woman, and readily exploited her beauty toward the furtherance of her agenda. She disliked pretending to be friendly, as she felt it did not come naturally. She was nevertheless compassionate toward the shamed Lieutenant Thewles, whose career was ruined by her seductive subterfuge.<ref name=\"Conviction\" />\n\nWhile her childhood experiences and the betrayal she felt she had suffered at the hands of Solo instilled in Dorvald a tendency to cry and exhibit volatile emotions, the young Jedi could also be driven and focused.<ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Outcast\" /> Similarly, her propensity to become frustrated when matters went awry contrasted with her capability to remain cool-headed and analytical in times of danger.<ref name=\"Fury\" /><ref name=\"Outcast\" /> Dorvald was also loyal, first to Solo and later to the Jedi Order; she placed her life at risk during the evacuation of the Coruscant Jedi Temple and once more during the ambush outside the Senate Building when she saved Master Katarn. Following her break with Solo, Dorvald decided to come clean about her past efforts to aid her sponsor, rather than remain anonymous as an informant. She desired the trust of her Jedi and was willing to go to great extents to obtain it.<ref name=\"Fury\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Quote|You caught me? With telekinesis?''\"<br />\"''Partly. You still hit hard.''\"<br />\"''Not that hard. You did very, very well.|Octa Ramis and Seha Dorvald|Fate of the Jedi: Outcast}}\nDorvald showed latent Force powers, though they were not fully developed because she had been inducted into the New Jedi Order at a more advanced age than most. She knew basic Force applications such as Force pushes and pulls, both common elements of telekinesis. Dorvald's skill was far from perfect, however, as demonstrated when she accidentally dropped Katarn from a height of two meters during their escape from Coruscant.<ref name=\"Fury\" /> By 43.5 ABY, Dorvald remained undertrained and years behind many of her peers. Nevertheless, her skill at telekinesis had by this time developed to the point at which she was able to use it first to aid her Master, Octa Ramis, as they pursued Valin Horn, and later to save the Chandrilan's life. Dorvald was also able to sense the emotions of Valin Horn from a distance, and using a Force meld, combined this sense with Ramis' own powers, enabling the Chandrilan woman to pinpoint the Jedi Knight's location.<ref name=\"Outcast\" /> Dorvald was also adept at working in close quarters and underground explorations, evidenced by her participation in the mission through the Coruscant Undercity to apprehend Jacen Solo,<ref name=\"Fury\" /> and later in the bowels of the Jedi Temple while it was besieged by Mandalorians.<ref name=\"Allies\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Seha Dorvald was created by [[Aaron Allston]] for the fourth novel of the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy of the Force]]'' series, ''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]''. Since the publication of ''Exile'' in [[February]] [[2007]], Dorvald has mostly appeared in novels written by Allston; the character was expanded upon and put to greater use in ''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]'', the seventh ''Legacy of the Force'' installment, and had a brief role in Allston's ''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]'', the opening novel in the [[Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi|''Fate of the Jedi'']] series, which began publication in [[2009]]. Prior to the ''Fate of the Jedi'' series, Dorvald was also afforded an individual entry in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Exile]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Fury]]''\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Outcast (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Outcast'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Allies (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Allies'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Ascension]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Ascension (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Ascension'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse]]''\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Apocalypse'' audiobook]]\n*[[Crucible (novel)|''Crucible'']]\n*[[Crucible (audiobook)|''Crucible'' audiobook]]\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Seha Dorvald\n|es=Seha Dorvald\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dorvald, Seha}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Coalition personnel]]\n[[Category:Jedi Knights of the New Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]"}}}]}}}}
