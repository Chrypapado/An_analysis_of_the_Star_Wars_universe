He was the [[Company/Legends|company]] armorer.\n\nWhen the battlemoon never arrived, the stormtroopers of his company became aggravated, some killing each other like the incident with [[Killium Neb]], and they were slowly killed off one by one by each other or the [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorreans]] of Pzob. When he was the only Stormtrooper of his company left, he wound up becoming a prisoner of the [[Klagg clan|Klaggs]] and [[Gakfedd clan|Gakfedds]] for two years. Some years later [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] crashed in the ''[[Huntbird]]'' on Pzob and Triv left his hut to investigate the crash finding a wounded man and [[Cray Mingla|woman]], he brought them to his hut and gave Luke the use of a respirator he had.\n\nAfter the group got to know each other, Triv offered to help fix the ''Huntbird'' in exchange for transportation off Pzob. While working on the ship they were attacked by the Gakfedd's and later the Klaggs, though the group was protected by locking themselves inside the ship.\n\nAs the Klaggs and Gakfedds fought, the ''Eye of Palpatine'' arrived on Pzob to finish its original programming, though finding no Stormtroopers, it decided to take the Gamorreans and the crew of the ''Huntbird'' onboard for indoctrination. Triv was the most affected by the indoctrination, being a [[Human/Legends|Human]] and a stormtrooper, becoming a member of the Gakfedds group of ''Imperials''. After a fight in the mess hall of the ''Eye of Palpatine'' Triv was ordered to execute Cray Mingla for being a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel saboteur]] and spy, though he finally came to his senses with the aid of Luke and helped Luke stop the execution.\n\nTriv helped to fly the shuttles the group used to escape from the ''Eye of Palpatine'' and landed on [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]]. When Triv saw Belsavis he became enchanted with the domed city of [[Plett's Well|Plawal]] and signed up for training as a [[horticulturist]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Triv Pothman#legends\n|ru=\u0422\u0440\u0438\u0432 \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043c\u0430\u043d\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pothman, Triv}}\n[[Category:Belsavians]]\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire]]"}}}]}}}}
