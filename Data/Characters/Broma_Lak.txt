He was one of the leading members of the [[Azure Cabal]], a [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] organization that operated in many parts of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]].\n\n==Biography==\nLak had been a [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] in the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]], but his loyalty was easy to purchase and he left to become a mercenary in the Azure Cabal. By [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Lak had become one of [[Loruna Scathe]]'s trusted inner circle of the Cabal.\n\nLak was the organization's point of contact in [[Theed/Legends|Theed]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. Most savvy intelligence operatives knew that he was associated with the Cabal's leader, Loruna Scathe, as he was less secretive than the other Cabal members. This was mainly because he maintained high respect among the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]], as he had friends in high places who owed him a favor or two. New members of the organization needed to obtain his endorsement in order to join the Cabal.\n\n1.5 ABY, a mercenary met with Lak to prove himself worthy of becoming a member of the Cabal. One of the Cabal's clients had contacted Lak to obtain information about [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] hydrostatic technology thought to be lost during the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Battle of Naboo]]. Lak decided to let the new mercenary have a go at this task. With Lak's guidance, the spacer attacked [[Gungan Scout Camp|a Gungan camp]] and finally discovered a long lost [[Gungan record bauble]]. The device was encrypted however, so Lak sent the mercenary to a contact of his, a Gungan named [[Jak Chucka]]. After the adventurer had fulfilled a series of tasks for Chucka and returned to Lak with the decrypted record bauble, Lak agreed to relay his endorsement to Scathe.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBroma Lak was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment's]] [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011. He could be found in the city of Theed on Naboo. Lak was part of the Azure Cabal quest line, which was added to the game with [http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/players/news_archive.vm?id=67250&month=052007 Chapter 6: ''Dangers of the Wild''] in May 2007.
