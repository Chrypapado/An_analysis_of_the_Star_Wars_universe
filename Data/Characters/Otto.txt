As a [[General/Legends|general]], he took part in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a conflict between the Empire and the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. Despite his status, Otto was regarded as largely incompetent. If it had not been the intervention of his friend, [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Conan Antonio Motti/Legends|Conan Antonio Motti]], Otto would have lost both his career and his life at the hands of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], the [[Supreme Commander (Empire)/Legends|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Fleet]]. The general was relocated to the [[Desert/Legends|barren]] planet of [[Lok/Legends|Lok]], where he was tasked with commanding an [[Imperial Outpost (Lok)|Imperial outpost]]. During his tenure on Lok, the general was forced to deal with an intruder who had been sent by the Rebel hero [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] to sow discord in the outpost. Dissatisfied with his situation, General Otto later deserted the Empire and entered [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] [[Jabba's demolition games|demolition games]] with a stolen [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]]. The general hoped he could garner enough [[Currency/Legends|money]] in the contest to fulfill his dream of buying a luxury apartment in [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], a floating [[City/Legends|metropolis]] suspended high among the [[Cloud/Legends|clouds]] of the planet [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\n{{Quote|Long live the Emperor!|General Otto|Star Wars: Demolition}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] of the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Species/Legends|species]], Otto hailed from the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]].<ref name=\"SWD\" /> He was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] in [[63 BBY]],<ref name=\"Age\" /> in the final [[Standard year/Legends|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]].<ref name=\"NEC\">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> At some point in the [[Imperial Period|period]] that followed the [[Declaration of a New Order|establishment]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] by the former [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Otto embraced a career in the [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial Military]]. A bumbling, insignificant man, the [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] climbed the [[Military rank/Legends|promotion ladder]] only thanks to his connections with [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Conan Antonio Motti/Legends|Conan Antonio Motti]],<ref name=\"CSWEOtto\">{{CSWECite|II|430|Otto, General}}</ref> an [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] [[Officer/Legends|officer]] who had not hesitated to pad his own record himself.<ref name=\"FF91\">''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 91]]''</ref> Eventually, Otto attained the rank of [[Imperial Army/Legends|Army]] [[General/Legends|general]].<ref name=\"CSWEOtto\" />\n\n===Put on the sidelines===\n{{Quote|Go disrupt the Imperial base here on Lok.

Show him that being on Lok is not an easy assignment.|Han Solo|Star Wars Galaxies}}\n[[File:GeneralOttoSWG.jpg|thumb|left|130px|General Otto during his time on Lok]]\nAs an Imperial general, Otto got involved in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], a [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy-wide]] conflict between the Empire and a resistance group called the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. Though overzealous and loyal to [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] Palpatine to the point of fanaticism, he lost many key battles to the Rebels during the early stages of the war.<ref name=\"SWG\" /> He was also rumored to have been a drug addict.<ref name=\"SWGTCG\">{{SWGTCG|set=Galactic Hunters|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Hunters#Card_gallery|cardname=General Otto}}</ref> Otto's career may have been damaged by his major blunders had it not been for another intervention of Admiral Motti, who saved him from the wrath of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], the Emperor's second-in-command and [[Supreme Commander (Empire)/Legends|Supreme Commander]] of the Imperial Fleet. Thanks to the machinations of Motti, Otto was quietly shipped to the planet of [[Lok/Legends|Lok]], a desolate world in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], where he was tasked with manning a massive [[Imperial Outpost (Lok)|Imperial outpost]]. On the disused wasteland of Lok, Motti hoped that his embarrassing friend would maintain a low profile.<ref name=\"SWD\" />\n\nInstead of fighting against organized crime on Lok, Otto chose to make an arrangement with its members. The general reached an understanding with [[Nym/Legends|Nym]], the [[Pirate/Legends|pirate]] leader of the [[Lok Revenants/Legends|Lok Revenants]], promising that his activities would not be interfered with if he refrained from attacking the Imperial outpost.<ref name=\"SWI65\">{{InsiderCite|65|Who's Who in Star Wars Galaxies}}</ref> Despite his arrangements, Otto once faced a brutal assault on his outpost led by a [[Unidentified mercenary warlord|notorious]] local [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenary]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]], but his troops were able to thwart that attack. The general also experienced trouble with his fellow members of the Empire. According to the discharged [[Sergeant/Legends|Sergeant]] [[Moore]], Otto was also at odds with other Imperials on Lok who sought to keep their activities secret from the general. Those activities included a [[Mining/Legends|mining]] [[Imperial mining facility|facility]] where gases and [[Mineral/Legends|minerals]] were extracted, and the associated [[Imperial Research Facility (Lok)|research facility]], where a [[Imperial Military Grenade Casing Unit|new type]] of [[Grenade/Legends|grenade]] was being developed.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nAt some point following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], a defunct [[R4-series agromech droid|R4-series]] [[agromech droid]] that had once belonged to Otto fell into the clutches of the [[Sulfur Lake Pirates]], who maintained a [[Sulfur Lake Pirates Hideout|hideout]] on Lok. The [[Droid/Legends|droid's]] [[memory core]], however, ended up in the hands of the mercenary [[Vana Sage]], who wanted to blackmail Otto based on its contents. Around the same time, the Rebel hero [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] sent one of his agents to cause mayhem in the Imperial outpost and show General Otto that being assigned on a backwater planet was not going to be easy. Otto confronted the Rebel agent that had come to torment him,<ref name=\"SWG\" /> but despite being a [[martial artist]],<ref name=\"SWGGuide\">''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref> the Imperial was beaten during the showdown. However, the general successfully escaped his opponent before being killed. Ultimately, the Rebel intruder returned to Solo to claim their reward, leaving Otto with combat injuries and hurt feelings.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n===Entering Jabba's games===\n[[File:Ottos_walker.png|thumb|right|100px|The Imperial AT-ST, Otto's weapon of choice]]\n{{Quote|I'm booking passage to Bespin!|Otto|Star Wars: Demolition}}\nSuch bad encounters and the sad spectacle of Lok's [[Desert/Legends|barren]] landscape made Otto dwell on his dream of retiring to a luxury apartment on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], a haven of airy platforms, spires, and towers floating in the [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]] of the [[Gas giant/Legends|gas giant]] [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. Eventually, in pursuit of that dream, Otto stole a [[Transport/Legends|transport]] and abandoned the Empire, taking an [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|AT-ST]] bipedal [[Walker/Legends|walker]] with him. Wanted by Imperial forces for desertion, Otto traveled to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]],<ref name=\"SWD\" /> a [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]]-controlled planet of the Outer Rim.<ref name=\"CL\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2005)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> Around [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]],<ref name=\"SWDdate\">The game ''[[Star Wars: Demolition]]'' featured [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] and [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] infiltrating [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|Jabba's Palace]] as [[Tamtel Skreej/Legends|Tamtel Skreej]] and [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]], which was shown in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']].

On the contest field of the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]], Otto confronted various worthy adversaries such as the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunters]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] and [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]], the Human [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] named [[Wade Vox]], the [[Dug/Legends|Dug]] [[Podracer (profession)/Legends|Podracer]] [[Pugwis]] and the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] engineer [[Quagga]]. The general also faced [[Malakili/Legends|Malakili]], the keeper of Jabba's [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]], as well as other accomplices of the Hutt, such as [[Wittin/Legends|Wittin]] the [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]]. Unbeknownst to the general, three heroes of the Rebel Alliance had also entered the derby: the [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] and Rebel leader [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], disguised as the bounty hunter [[Boushh/Legends|Boushh]], the former [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]] of Cloud City [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], posing as a guard named [[Tamtel Skreej/Legends|Tamtel Skreej]], and the latter's [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] assistant [[Lobot/Legends|Lobot]].<ref name=\"SWD\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I will not be stopped! Mmuahahaha!|Otto|Star Wars: Demolition}}\n[[File:Otto.png|thumb|left|Otto at the time of the demolition games]]\nWhile he was manning the Lok outpost, General Otto sported dark [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and a horseshoe-shaped mustache.<ref name=\"SWG\" /> However, by the time of Jabba's demolition derby, the general looked very different. He had gained excessive weight, his hair had gone entirely white, and he had grown a full beard with two points.<ref name=\"SWD\" /> As an officer, Otto was thought to lack dignity in his manners and appearance,<ref name=\"SWGTCG\" /> and even the Rebel hero Han Solo thought of him as unimportant, rather than a serious threat. At the time, Otto had no compunction about turning a blind eye to Lok's criminality, and the climate between the general and the other Imperials stationed there remained unsettled.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nIn spite of his grandfatherly looks, his fancy [[uniform]]<ref name=\"SWD\" /> and his poor reputation,<ref name=\"SWG\" /> Otto was still a dangerous individual. As a derby fighter, he suffered delusions of grandeur and a misplaced sense of superiority that fueled his sense of pugnacity.<ref name=\"SWD\" /> He was convinced that he had become the most powerful being in the [[Known Universe]]<ref name=\"Guide\">''[[Demolition: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''</ref> and that nothing or no one could stop him.<ref name=\"SWD\" /> Among his many flaws, if rumors about him were true, the general was addicted to the mind-altering [[Spice/Legends|spice]].<ref name=\"SWGTCG\" /> In fact, Otto would sometimes threaten his defeated opponents with a transfer to the [[Spice Mines of Kessel|Spice Mines]] of [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]]. Despite being a deserter and a self-obsessed man, General Otto maintained a certain degree of loyalty toward the Empire and Palpatine, as he would sometimes enter the demolition contests yelling \"Long live the Emperor!\"<ref name=\"SWD\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|You're headed to the spice mines, scum!|Otto|Star Wars: Demolition}}\nAs part of his Imperial officer training, General Otto was a master of ranged combat using [[Blaster carbine/Legends|blaster carbines]]. He had also learned the rudiments of [[Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si/Legends|Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si]], a [[Unarmed combat|weaponless]] martial art.<ref name=\"SWGGuide\" /> He was also capable of piloting his modified AT-ST all by himself,<ref name=\"SWD\" /> while manning that vehicle normally required two crewmen, a [[Vehicle Command Crewer|pilot]], and a [[Gunner/Legends|gunner]].<ref name=\"BtM\">''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nIn the Lok Imperial Outpost, Otto simply wore the Empire's [[Imperial military uniforms/Legends|standard uniform]], which consisted of a double-breasted grey tunic with matching trousers, black [[Leather/Legends|leather]] [[Belt/Legends|belt]], black [[Boot/Legends|boots]], and a [[Hat/Legends|hat]]. On the left side of the upper chest, he sported a single [[Imperial code cylinder]] and the [[Rank insignia plaque/Legends|insignia]] of an army general. His cap and belt were also equipped with an [[Imperial officer's disc|officer's disc]],<ref name=\"SWG\" /> which contained coded information.<ref name=\"BtM\" /> When taking part in Jabba's contests, he wore a garish version of an [[Imperial Army trooper/Legends|Imperial Army trooper]] dress uniform with red pants, a [[Gold/Legends|golden]] plastron, a blue cape and a wide array of medals and festoons. He also wore a fancy rank plaque made of twelve golden squares.<ref name=\"SWD\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:GeneralOtto.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Original depiction of General Otto from ''Star Wars Galaxies'']]\nGeneral Otto first appeared as a playable character in ''[[Star Wars: Demolition]]'', a vehicular combat [[video game]] featuring characters, locations and vehicles from around the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. Voice actor [[Tom Kane]] voiced Otto in that game, along with [[Bib Fortuna/Legends|Bib Fortuna]], Boba Fett and Lobot.<ref name=\"SWD\" />\n\nIn ''Star Wars: Demolition'', depending on the player's success, Otto could either win the tournament, which led him to fulfill his dream, or lose it, which had him to turned over to a pair of Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] by one of his fellow contestants, Boba Fett, and ultimately left at Darth Vader's mercy.<ref name=\"SWD\" /> Otto's AT-ST walker was the first vehicle created for the game. It was also a favorite of the graphician [[Edvard Toth]], who modeled some and textured all vehicles in ''Star Wars: Demolition''.<ref name=\"Toth\">{{Cite_web|url=http://edvardtoth.com/games/star-wars-demolition/#.UfbKP417JXN|title=Star Wars: Demolition|work=Edvard Toth's website|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206011520/http://edvardtoth.com/games/star-wars-demolition/}}</ref>\n\nThe general also appeared in the now-defunct [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. Originally, Otto in ''Star Wars Galaxies'' did not appear like he did in ''Star Wars: Demolition''.<ref name=\"SWG\" /> However, the events depicted in ''Galaxies'' occurred between [[0 BBY/Legends|0]] and [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]],<ref name=SGW Date\">According to its [[opening crawl]], ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' was set sometime after [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. One character in the [[Video game|game]], [[Ruwan Tokai]], referenced the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] as occurring one [[Standard year/Legends|year]] earlier, placing the timeline somewhere around [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]]. However, the existence of other characters and quests in the game indicated a timeline of anywhere from [[0 ABY/Legends|0]] to [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]].</ref> a few years at best before Jabba's demolition games. Otto's appearance in ''Galaxies'' was later changed by the developers so he would wear a mustache, but he still looked younger, taller, and thinner than his ''Demolition'' incarnation.<ref name=\"SWG\" /> In the 2000 video game, Otto was shown to be overweight and a head shorter than two stormtroopers,<ref name=\"SWD\" /> while his ''Galaxies'' incarnation was of average height with a smaller waistline.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\nIn ''Star Wars Galaxies'', Rebel players could be tasked by Han Solo with fighting and killing Otto. In actuality, the general would not die. Once the player got his health to 10%, Otto would yell \"Aaaah! Get away from me!!\" and run away by despawning.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Demolition]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SWArchive|url=gaming/videogames/news/news20001114.html|text=Demolish or Be Demolished!|archivedate=20040414191650}}\n*''[[Demolition: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n*{{InsiderCite|65|Who's Who in Star Wars Galaxies}} <!-- 2003-01-3 -->\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' <!-- 2005-05-31 -->\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' <!-- 2005-12-20 -->\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{SWGTCG|set=Galactic Hunters|link=https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/File:General_Otto_(card).JPG|cardname=General Otto|nobackup=1}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|General Otto}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|ru=\u041e\u0442\u0442\u043e\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Imperial Army generals of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Imperial defectors]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
