She was a criminal who was sentenced to death in gladiatorial combat in the [[Soruus system]]. She was among the combatants provided with a [[JX4 Gladiator Prototype]] battle [[Armor/Legends|armor]] in order for the model to be tested. Morana managed to escape the arena, taking advantage of a diversion created by sabotage. Subsequently, she and a group of fellow escapees committed atrocious crimes against the galactic public. Eventually, the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] set out to hunt down the escapees. Morana, however, managed to evade the Empire, and in the process she obtained an extra JX4 armor in addition to her own.<ref name=\"OBA\" />\n\nShe ended up in the employ of the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] known as [[Kaggle|Boss Kaggle]] on the planet [[Lanthrym]] where a group of adventurers attempted to capture her in order to retrieve her battle armors and to claim the bounty of 10,000 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], the Empire had issued on her head.<ref name=\"OBA\" /> The bounty hunter [[Staven]] tracked Fal for almost a year, cornering her on at a waterfront on Ord Mantell. Staven withdrew from combat when it became clear that Fal's armor gave her the advantage. Another hunter, [[Trityn]], used her habit of frequenting waterfronts to their advantage. During the engagement, Fal fired her armor's [[conner net]] at Trityn; the bounty hunter deflected it into the water and the resulting short-circuit resulted in her capture.<ref name=\"GFT\" />\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Journal|3|Outlaw Battle Armor}} {{1stm}}\n*''[[Gundark's Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear]]'' <!--55-->\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fal, Morana}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Mantellians]]"}}}]}}}}
