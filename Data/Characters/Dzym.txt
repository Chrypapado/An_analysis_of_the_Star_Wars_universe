He was grown from his small insectoid form to take the appearance and height of a [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]]. He conspired with [[Seti Ashgad/Legends|Seti Ashgad]] and nearly invaded the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] with his fellow drochs, but was stopped by the [[Tsil]] and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|And at heart he doesn't really care. All he wants is to get off this planet, into more fertile worlds.|[[Callista Ming]] to [[Leia Organa Solo]]|Planet of Twilight}}\nDzym was a [[droch]] genetically altered by [[Beldorion]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] cook as a treat for the Hutt to eat. He became [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] and killed the cook. In cahoots with [[Seti Ashgad/Legends|Seti Ashgad]], he plotted to take drochs off [[Nam Chorios/Legends|Nam Chorios]], thus devastating [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], and providing himself eternal feeding grounds. He was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during the attempt to launch off-world by the local population, who had been influenced by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. At his death, Dzym was two hundred and fifty years old.\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I heard you and Dzym talking, that is, but I couldn't hear what you said. Only the way you shrank away, the way you fear him.|[[Leia Organa Solo]] to [[Liegeus Vorn]]|Planet of Twilight}}\nDespite his appearance as a gaunt [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]], without his robe, he was decidedly [[Alien/Legends|alien]]. His torso and fingertips were covered in razor-sharp toothed orifices. He had the same ability to leech life as other droch beetles, and in one instance ate one of the larger crab-like drochs, describing the flavor as \"sweet.\"\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Planet of Twilight]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Fate of the Jedi: Conviction (audiobook)|''Fate of the Jedi: Conviction'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*[[The Essential Guide to Alien Species (real-world book)|''The Essential Guide to Alien Species'']]\n*{{FFCite|82|MAN8, ''Weapons Manufacturers''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20020905twilight|text=The Planet of Twilight|int=The Planet of Twilight|archivedate=20090917014142}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dzym\n|pl=Dzym\n|fi=Dzym\n}}\n\n[[Category:Drochs]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nam Chorios residents]]\n[[Category:Planetary leaders]]"}}}]}}}}
