During his captivity, he met the Bith woman [[Narlissa]] and both became lovers.<ref name=\"SWG:LL\" /> Circa [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]],<ref name=\"TRoD\">{{SWG|The Ruins of Dantooine}}</ref> Bannoc finally managed to escape the bunker with a group of slaves led by [[Kyran Silene]]. However, Narlissa remained captive. The escaped slaves did not reach Tyrena and established a camp in the wilderness.<ref name=\"SWG:LL\" /> A spacer recruited by Kyran Silene's [[Madison Silene|wife]] later arrived at the camp.<ref name=\"SWG:TtB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Talk to Bandor|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer planed to infiltrate the bunker to find evidence of the slaver operations for the [[Corellian Security Force]].<ref name=\"SWG:IE\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=class|Legacy|Incriminating Evidence|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer also met Bannoc G'noc and agreed to rescue Narlissa while going to the bunker. Unfortunately, Narlissa was executed by the slavers in the meanwhile. Once in the bunker, the spacer reached the detentions cells with the help of a guard who felt deeply guilty for working with the slavers. The spacer eventually found the body of Narlissa and brought her personal diary to Bannoc G'noc.<ref name=\"SWG:LL\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBannoc G'noc was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:LL\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Bannoc G'noc was added to the game with the update named \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 1|Chapter 1: The Corellian Captives]]\", published on [[June 8]], [[2006]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/content.vm?id=64186&resource=publish|text=Chapter Archive 2006|archivedate=20111124002054}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Love Lost}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:G'noc, Bannoc}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Bith]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Slaves]]"}}}]}}}}
