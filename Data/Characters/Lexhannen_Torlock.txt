He tried to deliver some secret plans to the Rebel Alliance. The Emperor had him killed.|S'ybll posing as Frija Torlock|A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker}}\n'''Lexhannen Torlock''' was the Imperial [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]]. He was incredibly paranoid and believed that the Rebels were planning to capture Corulag. Torlock put all his money into increasing the defenses of the planet, but he also put a substantial amount into devising an escape route. In secret, he hired the Imperial [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]], [[Massad Thrumble]] to create [[Human replica droid]]s of himself and his daughter [[Frija Torlock|Frija]].<ref name=\"TEGtD\">''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''</ref><ref name=\"SS\" />\n\nUnfortunately for Torlock, the attack did not come from the rebels, but from his own daughter. Frija wanted to rule Corulag herself and devised a plan alongside Torlock's most trusted confidant, [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Droon]], to implicate Torlock as a traitor. Torlock learned of the plan and fled off-world. Before leaving he activated the two droids to act as decoys. Admiral Droon's men captured the [[Lexhannen Torlock (droid)|false Torlock]] and discovered that the real Torlock had departed Corulag. Droon's men used a hologram of Torlock to give the appearance that their Governor had not left the world. The ruse also succeeded in capturing the [[Frija Torlock (droid)|droid]] with the resemblance of Frija.<ref name=\"SS\" />\n\nAt the same time, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] had sent his agent, [[Wrenga Jixton]] to deal with Torlock who he believed was a traitor. Vader eventually learned of how Torlock had been wrongfully fingered, and he executed Droon for his treachery.<ref name=\"SS\" /> Sometime after the Battle of Hoth, the [[mind-witch]] [[S'ybll]] posed as Torlock's daughter in order to gain [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker's]] trust. While posing as Frija, S'ybll told Skywalker that Lehannen had been executed after betraying the Empire. However, due to the ruse, it was unknown if this information was reliable.<ref name=\"ANHTLoLS15\">''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]'', Chapter 15</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Shadow Stalker]]'' {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n*''[[A New Hope: The Life of Luke Skywalker]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back (Second Edition)]]''\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*{{FFCite|37|German Edition - JIX2, ''Wrenga \"Jix\" Jixton''}}\n*{{FFCite|127|FRI1-4, ''Frija Torlock''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20040325web|text=Galactic Gazetteer: Hoth and the Greater Javin|int=Galactic Gazetteer: Hoth and the Greater Javin|archivedate=20100508024939}} {{C|Spelled Turlock}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lexhannen Torlock\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Torlock, Lexhannen}}\n[[Category:Corulag residents]]\n[[Category:Governors of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
