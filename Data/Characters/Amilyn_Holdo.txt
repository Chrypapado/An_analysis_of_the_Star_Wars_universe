That spark&mdash;this Resistance&mdash;must survive. That is our mission. Now, to your stations, and may the Force be with us.|Amilyn Holdo|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}\n'''Amilyn Holdo''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] [[Politics|politician]], [[Military rank|military commander]], and freedom fighter who served in both the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and the [[Resistance]]. Known for her unconventional strategy and eccentric style, she was an early participant in the rebellion against the [[Galactic Empire]] and a lifelong friend and ally to rebel leader [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of [[Alderaan]]. In the early days of the [[First Order-Resistance War]], Holdo became the [[commanding officer]] of the [[Resistance navy|Resistance fleet]] as it fled the overwhelming might of the [[First Order Navy]]. Her leadership in that role saved the Resistance and many of its heroes when she executed a historic [[suicide]] attack on the First Order fleet, later dubbed the [[Holdo maneuver]].\n\nA [[Homeworld|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Gatalenta]], Amilyn Holdo had an early career in public service as a [[Apprentice Legislator|delegate]] to the Imperial [[Apprentice Legislature]] program. During her term, Holdo was notably critical of oppressive [[New Order|Imperial policy]] and developed a close relationship with the like-minded [[Alderaanian]] [[Prince|Princess]] Leia Organa. Through Organa, she became involved in the operations of the insurgent Rebel Alliance in opposition to the Empire during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Although she initially served as a [[Alliance Civil Government|civil]] [[minister]], Holdo proved herself as a capable martial commander and was granted an officer's commission in the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]].\n\nDecades after the Alliance's [[Galactic Concordance|victory]] over the Empire, Holdo was again recruited by Organa\u2014this time to join her paramilitary Resistance movement against the rise of the neo-Imperial [[First Order]]. Holdo served then-[[General]] Organa during the [[Cold War]] as a [[Vice Admiral|vice admiral]] of the Resistance fleet, undertaking clandestine missions to prepare for open war. After the war [[Hosnian Cataclysm|erupted]] in [[34 ABY]], [[Resistance High Command]] was decimated, leaving Holdo as the highest ranking [[Resistance officer|officer]] in charge of the remaining Resistance forces as they fled from the [[Battle of Oetchi|pursuing]] First Order armada and its mobile [[Capital|headquarters]], the ''[[Supremacy]]''.\n\n[[Hyperspace tracker|Unable]] to escape into [[hyperspace]] and low on [[fuel]], the remaining Resistance personnel consolidated under Holdo's command aboard the [[flagship]] [[MC85 Star Cruiser|star cruiser]] [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']]. Holdo's singular focus on escape was controversial among some younger [[soldier]]s like [[Captain]] [[Poe Dameron]], but the vice admiral successfully led the Resistance to the [[mineral]] world of [[Crait]], where she intended to sneak the survivors to the surface aboard [[Cloaking device|cloaked]] [[U-55 orbital loadlifter|transports]]. Due to an information leak during an attempted mutiny, the First Order ascertained her plan and destroyed nearly all of the Resistance transports. In a stunning act of sacrifice, Holdo saved the Resistance from complete obliteration by jumping the ''Raddus'' directly into the First Order fleet, resulting in a [[lightspeed]] collision that destroyed the Resistance flagship, the ''Supremacy'', and twenty [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyers]]. Holdo's actions allowed the remnants of the Resistance to [[Battle of Crait|escape]], ensuring the continuation of an organized opposition to the First Order's [[Fascism|fascist]] regime.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rebellious youth===\n{{Quote|Then there's this girl from Gatalenta named Amilyn Holdo who is&hellip;let's say, a little odd.''\"<br />\"''I trust your judgement, Leia, but don't be too quick to write people off.

The young Holdo also studied [[astrology]], public service, and [[Philosopher|philosophy]]. She found herself at odds with Gatalentan aesthetics and traditions of simplicity and tranquility, instead embracing eccentricities and seeking out danger.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nIn [[3 BBY]],<ref name=\"LPOA Date\">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' places [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa's]] birth in [[19 BBY]]. The events of ''[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan]]'' commence just after Organa's sixteenth [[birthday]], which places the events of the novel in 3 BBY.</ref> Holdo was set to represent Gatalenta in the [[Apprentice Legislature]], a junior deliberative program in the Empire to train youth in [[politics]] on the Imperial [[capital]] world of [[Coruscant]]. In the lead-up to their first legislative session, Holdo and several other members of the Apprentice Legislature were invited by [[Alderaanian monarchy|Queen]] [[Breha Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] to participate in a [[pathfinding]] class, wherein students would learn survival techniques through challenging expeditions in natural environments. Holdo's first pathfinding course was in Alderaan's [[Istabith range]] and led by [[Chief]] [[Pangie]] of the [[Chandrilan Pathfinding Corps]]. During their orientation at the [[Pathfinding class chalet|pathfinders' chalet basecamp]], Holdo met several of her fellow classmates and soon-to-be [[Apprentice Legislator|apprentice legislators]], including [[Chassellon Stevis]] of Coruscant, [[Harp Allor]] of [[Chandrila]], [[Sssamm Ashsssen]] of [[Fillithar]], and Alderaan's delegates [[Kier Domadi]] and [[Prince|Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nDuring the introductory pathfinding class, Chief Pangie left the students deep within the [[Water|frozen]] Istabith range, charging them with returning to the chalet by nightfall using only their observational skills to guide them out of the wilderness, or risk being expelled from the class. When her fellow student Harp Allor [[Bone|broke]] her leg during the return hike, Holdo committed to helping Allor back to the chalet alongside students Ashsssen, Domadi, and Organa; Stevis meanwhile led the rest of the class onward, refusing to slow down for their injured classmate. Holdo's crew progressed slowly back down the range and were in danger of missing their nightfall deadline, but the young Gatalentan's unconventional thinking saved them from failure when she thought to convert her expandable emergency [[tent]] into an ad hoc toboggan that could carry all five members of her troop downhill.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\n====Apprentice Legislator====\n{{Quote|Good intentions aren't enough.

She was present for the legislature's opening ceremonies in the [[Imperial Plaza|Senate complex]], where she witnessed an introductory speech by [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. Her gaudy wardrobe and peculiar behavior at the following reception contributed to Holdo's growing reputation for eccentricity among her fellow delegates.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nHoldo participated in the first formal session of the Apprentice Legislature the next day, where she introduced to her colleagues her passion for astrology and participated in a debate over where [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] should charter a new [[Imperial Academy|Imperial academy]] for aeronautical [[Engineer|engineering]] and design. The debate was focused on four potential sites: [[Iloh]], [[Harloff Minor]], [[Lonera]], and the impoverished world [[Arreyel]]. Princess Organa argued in favor of selecting Arreyel and convinced a winning margin of delegates to support the proposal. Weeks later, Holdo learned that the Apprentice Legislature received a special commendation for their selection of Arreyel after early surveys for the academy revealed massive sub-surface [[radiation]] sources. The discovery triggered an Imperial effort to displace the local populace within six weeks so the [[Imperial Military]] could blast away the surface and build sprawling planet-wide [[Factory|factories]] on Arreyel. Holdo was devestated by the development shared her disappointment with Organa and Domadi, both of whom were also opposed to the brutal authoritarianism of Palpatine's reign.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\n[[File:ApprenticeLegislature-LeiaManga.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Holdo stood out as one of the few critical voices in the Apprentice Legislature, earning the trust of Palpatine opponents from the Alderaanian delegation.]]\nIn a later session, the Apprentice Legislature was tasked with determining which punitive sanctions would be levied against the planet [[Lolet]] for its violation of [[Regulation 16-ME]], which stipulated that worlds were legally required to provide [[fuel]] to [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|Imperial pilots]] as needed. Holdo was opposed to any sanctions at all, arguing that Lolet's refusal to provide the fuel was reasonable, considering its economic conditions and low reserves of fuel indicated the planet was in a state of near-crisis. Her research revealed that Lolet's reserves were largely depleted after significant geological activity on one of its [[moon]]s, leaving the world without the resources to support both Imperial patrols and their own people in the event of future emergencies. Holdo's argument&mdash;that no planet was legally required to imperil themselves to supply the military&mdash;was convincing for Domadi and Organa. She was opposed by delegates from [[Arkanis]] and [[Glee Anselm]], who ridiculed her flamboyant style and accused her of treason for the mere suggestion that the Empire was not a reliable safety net for worlds in crisis.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nThe episode had a deep impact on Princess Organa, who fiercely defended Holdo on the legislature's floor and motioned successfully to draft a new language proposal for the [[Imperial Legal Code]] rather than impose sanctions on Lolet for circumstances not enshrined in law. The Lolet debate and other experiences endeared Organa to Holdo, and the two became increasingly close during their terms. Holdo instructed the Alderaanian [[noble]] in Gatalentan skyfaring and helped Organa to better understand her evolving relationship with her [[House of Organa|parents]] and her paramour, Kier Domadi. At the time, Organa weighed whether to involve Holdo in the clandestine operations of the nascent [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|allied rebel movement]] organized by her [[Parent|father]], [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]], but decided against it.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\n====The Princess's companion====\n{{Quote|Some individuals have decided that&mdash;that the worlds of this galaxy need a defense other than the Empire&mdash;a defense against the Empire&mdash;''\"<br />\"''An ''uprising''.

It's still time.|Leia Organa reveals the rebel movement to Holdo|Leia, Princess of Alderaan}}\nDuring the legislative term, Holdo continued her pathfinding class with Cheif Pangie and the other delegates, attending sessions in [[Eriadu]]'s [[Rivoche Ranges]], on [[Felucia]]'s [[jungle]] cliffs, and through [[Chandrila]]'s vast [[Swamp|marshlands]]. Their final session took them to the [[ocean]] world of [[Pamarthe]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], where Holdo was partnered with Organa and the two were tasked with navigating extensive island chains via rope bridges to reach Pangie's location.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nHoldo and Organa were distracted from their objective when they discovered [[Senator]] [[Winmey Lenz]] of Chandrila&mdash;a vocal critic of Palpatine's&mdash;meeting with [[Orson Callan Krennic|an]] Imperial Military [[Director]] in a Pamarthe [[spaceport]] to conduct a massive, off-the-record sale of [[quadanium steel]]. Organa knew Lenz to be a co-conspirator in her father's rebel network, to whom the senator was also secretly brokering sales of quadanium. While they eavesdropped on Lenz's conversation, the two girls learned that a shipment of Lenz's quadanium was imminently leaving Pamarthe for [[Ocahont]]&mdash;a world which Organa knew to be a hub for rebel operations. When Organa indicated her desire to know more about the shipment, Holdo jumped aboard the [[freighter]] bound for Ocahont, compelling Organa to stow away with her.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\n[[File:Leia_and_Kier.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Leia Organa and Kier Domadi, Holdo's friends and allies in the Apprentice Legislature]]\nEn route to Ocahont, Organa revealed to Holdo that she had firsthand knowledge of an armed and organized rebel movement. Before she could reveal more, the two stowaways were discovered by a pair of [[Quarren]] crewmembers and taken to a [[Unidentified outpost|rebel outpost]] on Ocahont as [[prisoner]]s. There, they were presented to the outpost overseer: Chandrila's other senator and close ally of the Organas, [[Mon Mothma]]. Although Mothma was frustrated at the Princess for putting herself in a dangerous situation and revealing the rebel plot to Holdo, the senator was grateful for the girls' information about Lenz's double dealing. After the meeting with Senator Mothma, Holdo and Organa were sent back to their parents; Holdo maintained Organa's secret and did not reveal to her parents the true nature of her stowaway misadventure.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nHoldo returned to Coruscant shortly thereafter to go to a formal ball at the [[Imperial Palace]] attended by apprentice legislators and graduates from the [[Royal Imperial Academy]]. Some time after the ball, she planned to return to Gatalenta to participate in a meditative retreat, and so hired the [[YT-2400 light freighter|light freighter]] ''[[Mighty Oak Apocalypse]]'' to ferry her from Coruscant back to her [[homeworld]]. At the spaceport, Holdo was met by Chassellon Stevis, who argued that he should be able to usurp the ''Mighty Oak Apocalypse''{{'s}} services so he could travel to an auction on [[Arkanis]] to buy a rare [[speeder]]. While the two argued, Princess Organa found them and asked Holdo if she could use the ship's services instead. Holdo recognized the urgency in Organa's request and immediately agreed to help her friend, to Stevis's irritation.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nOrgana had learned that the Empire was aware of a [[Rebel base (Paucris)|rebel presence]] in the [[Paucris system]], where Senator Bail Organa was overseeing a secret staging ground for a fledgling [[Rebel Alliance Navy|rebel fleet]] as its vessels were refitted for combat. Together aboard the ''Mighty Oak Apocalypse'', Holdo and Organa travelled back to Pamarthe, where they planned to hire a different ship from a high-traffic spaceport to reach Paucris and warn Senator Organa that the Empire was likely to launch an imminent attack. On Pamarthe, the two girls struggled to find a willing pilot due to dangerous [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] and [[Star|solar]] [[Solar storm|storms]], but Organa managed to use her political connections to convince a crew of [[Chalhuddan]]s to take the job.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nThe Chalhuddan vessel reached the Paucris system with enough time for Organa's warning to reach her father. As the rebel fleet prepared to [[Evacuation of Paucris Major|evacuate]], Holdo and Organa briefly rendezvoused with the senator on his starship, the ''[[Tantive IV]]'', before transferring to a small hopper [[transport]] that they could fly back to Coruscant. The Princess kept the hopper [[Star system|in-system]] while Holdo monitored the dozens of rebel ships escaping to [[hyperspace]]. After the rebel vessels left, Holdo noticed one new [[Starcutter|ship]] moving quickly towards the abandoned refitting [[Space station|stations]]. To her and Organa's surprise, the vessel's pilot was Kier Domadi, who had followed Organa to the Paucris system. Domadi was unaware that the stations had engaged their [[self-destruct mechanism]] and his vessel was caught in the resulting explosion. Holdo and Organa docked their ship with Domadi's badly damaged transport to rescue him, but their friend had been mortally wounded in the explosion and [[Death|died]].<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nWhile Organa retrieved Domadi's body and grieved the loss of her romantic partner, Holdo flew their hopper directly to Alderaan, knowing that both of her friends needed to return to their home. Upon entering the [[Alderaan system]], their ship was detected by Imperial authorities who suspected it was returning from the Paucris system. Holdo's knowledge of astrology helped her convincingly lie to the Imperial [[captain]] that they had instead just come from the [[Shili system]], and was able to return Organa and Domadi safely home.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nHoldo and Organa became close friends after the death of Domadi as they leaned on one another to process the loss. Holdo took her friend skyfaring [[Standard day|daily]] and attended the investiture ceremony on Alderaan where Organa formally became the world's crown princess.<ref name=\"Leia\" /> Publicly, they maintained appearances as loyal Imperial politicians,<ref name=\"Right Wrong Turn\">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|25|The Right Wrong Turn}}</ref> while privately they joined the efforts the Alliance to Restore the Republic as rebel operatives.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" />\n\n[[File:Holdo-Leia-Dancers.png|thumb|right|250px|Holdo and Organa explore a Coruscant undercity circus.]]\nAround this period, Organa offered to teach Holdo how to drive a [[speeder]] on Coruscant; Holdo accepted the lesson, both because she was an inexperienced driver and because she hoped to take Organa's speeder to the [[Coruscant Underworld]] to find an [[Lost museum|ancient, lost museum]] somewhere in [[Level 4]], deep within the subterranean superstructure of the [[ecumenopolis]]. Organa was impressed with Holdo's driving skills in a [[Speeder piloting practice park|practice area]], but did not agree to go with her friend to find the museum, insisting that nobody could get deeper than [[Level 5]] on Coruscant. Holdo was insistent that it was possible, and plunged the two deep into the Coruscant underbelly to find directions.<ref name=\"Right Wrong Turn\" />\n\nAt an underworld [[circus]], Holdo found a [[Zeltron]] fortune teller called [[Lord|Lady]] [[Forzaa]] and pushed Organa to pay for her assistance. In exchange, Forzaa used a [[Liga crystal]] to imbue Organa's hands with a soft glow that strengthened as they approached the museum Holdo sought. Back in their speeder, Holdo took the girls deeper into the undercity, following Organa's glow, until they happened upon a group of criminals carrying out operations in the darkness. The girls were chased by the criminals on [[speeder bike]]s and managed to flee into a massive pipeline before being driven out by a [[thermal detonator]] blast and a swarm of [[mutant]] [[roach-rat]]s. Holdo and Organa escaped all their pursuers and made it to the museum on Level 4, where they discovered a soaring statuary hall lit by glowing [[Color|blue]] [[coral]]. The experience brought the two girls closer together and strengthened their resolve to advocate for those that lived deep below the heights of power.<ref name=\"Right Wrong Turn\" />\n\n====War with the Empire====\n{{Quote|Run diagnostics.

While she relaxed in her quarters with the [[droid]] [[Tee-Six (Candor)|Tee-Six]] and used a [[Morogian snap plant]] to [[Hair dye|dye]] her hair, the ''Candor'' came under [[Attack on the Candor|attack]] from an ''[[Imperial-class Star Destroyer]]'' and suffered severe damage. Holdo made her way to the [[bridge]], where she discovered the ship's commander, Captain [[Jardar]], was killed in the initial volley. Minister Holdo quickly began issuing orders to the stunned crew, taking command of the ''Candor'' as the highest ranking Rebel on the ship.<ref name=\"The Bridge\" />\n[[File:Holdo_assumes_command.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Holdo assumes command of the ''Candor''|link=Special:FilePath/Holdo_assumes_command.jpg]]\nHoldo overcame the bridge crew's reservations about her command when the ship was caught in the [[Star Destroyer]]'s [[tractor beam]]. On her orders, the pilots reoriented the ''Candor'' towards the Star Destroyer and opened fire on its exposed [[hangar]]. The blasts burned a hole through the destroyer's hull, allowing the blockade runner's [[Ion engine|ion drives]] to push the ship through and out of danger. The unconventional maneuver saved the crew of the ''Candor'' and impressed Rebel command. Holdo's performance in battle proved Princess Organa's plaudits for her friend and secured her a new [[Military rank|role]] as a captain in the Alliance Fleet.<ref name=\"The Bridge\" />\n\n[[File:Holdo_holo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Holdo reporting on Crimson Dawn.]]\nLater in the war, Holdo was embedded with the criminal syndicates of the galactic underworld to secure supply chains for the Alliance. After the Rebellion was routed and scattered during the [[Battle of Hoth]] in [[3 ABY]], Holdo discovered that the once-defunct syndicate [[Crimson Dawn]] had returned, and was hosting an auction of Rebel captain [[Han Solo]] on the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] world of [[Jekara]]. Solo was a companion of Leia Organa's who had been frozen in [[carbonite]] while in Imperial custody shortly after the two escaped from Hoth. Although Holdo was not in regular communication with Organa during this period, she knew the princess was searching for Solo and so left a holomessage at one of their dead drops with the news about the rebel captain, the return of Crimson Dawn, and the invitation to the auction that had gone out to the major actors in the criminal underworld. The message ultimately reached the princess's team and Holdo's information helped them find their way to Jekara to attempt a rescue.<ref name=\"SW 2020 14\">[[Star Wars (2020) 14|''Star Wars'' (2020) 14]]</ref>\n\n===Resistance leader===\n====Organa's secret war====\n{{Quote|There's been something growing out there.

Lintra helped guide the vessel back to Blue Squadron and the ''Ninka'', and brought the pilot on board to meet Vice Admiral Holdo.

Working alongside Lieutenant Lintra and bomber commander [[Fossil]], Holdo led the Resistance to [[Battle of Sheh Soahi|victory]] over the Sheh Soahi [[pirate]]s, all while avoiding direct engagement with patrolling First Order forces. The Resistance win in Cassander space foiled the First Order's ambitions in the sector and provided confirmation that the enemy was supplying arms and resources to pirate forces.<ref name=\"Bomber Command\" />\n\n[[File:TallissanLintra-SWZ.png|thumb|left|250px|During the Cold War, Holdo oversaw the operations of several Resistance starfighter and bomber units.]]\nAfter the Cassander campaign, Holdo joined General Organa and Commander Fossil at the Resistance's [[Resistance base|secret base]] on [[D'Qar]] to discuss the First Order [[Atterra campaign|lockdown]] of the [[Atterra system]]. Using intelligence gathered by Cobalt Squadron and reconnaissance efforts by Rose and Paige Tico, Holdo and Organa worked with [[Casca Panzoro]] of the Atterran insurgent group [[Bravo Rising]] to devise a plan for their StarFortress bomber squadrons to covertly deliver relief supplies and armaments to the beleaguered people of [[Atterra Bravo]].

The attack obliterated the New Republic as a government and military entity, leaving the Resistance as the only organized opposition to the First Order.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> General Organa immediately marshalled the forces of the Resistance for a [[Battle of Starkiller Base|counterstrike]] against Starkiller Base, but Holdo and the bombers of Crimson and Cobalt Squadron were too far afield to join the assault.<ref name=\"Cobalt Squadron\" />\n\nAlthough Resistance agents were able to destroy the superweapon, the Hosnian Cataclysm was only the first sortie in the war. As First Order [[First Order Navy|armadas]] and [[legion]]s of [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] moved quickly to conquer the galaxy, General Organa recalled Holdo and all other Resistance forces to D'Qar to assist in an [[Battle of D'Qar|emergency evacuation effort]].<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> After the StarFortress bomber teams finished their successful final runs to Atterra, Holdo met them at their staging location on [[Refnu]]<ref name=\"Cobalt Squadron\" /> in the Outer Rim<ref name=\"TLJ EE\">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> to brief them on the events surrounding the firing of Starkiller Base.

Although the ''[[Cobalt Hammer]]'' was able to complete it's bombing run and destroy the ''Fulminatrix'' before it launched a destructive volley at the fleet, every StarFortress in Cobalt and Crimson squadron was destroyed during the effort&mdash;a major blow to the Resistance's dwindling forces.

Holdo and Organa had a plan for survival derived from their experience in the Rebellion: after jumping to safety to escape the First Order, they would head to the [[mineral]] planet [[Crait]] in a nearby system, where they would regroup and and begin the search for allies and resources from the hidden safety of an [[Crait outpost|abandoned Rebel outpost]] dating back to the Galactic Civil War. Far in the Outer Rim and overlooked by political and economic powers alike, Crait did not appear on most modern [[star map]]s, and would make a fitting base for the Resistance, provided its secrecy was maintained. To ensure that secrecy, Holdo and Organa decided not to share their plan widely to avoid potential leaks to enemy agents during a precarious time for their movement.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" />\n\n[[File:AttackOnTheResistanceFleet-TLJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Resistance fleet is ambushed by the ''Supremacy'' and the First Order armada.]]\nBefore their plan could get underway, a First Order armada [[Battle of Oetchi|arrived]] in the Oetchi system,<ref name=\"TLJ AJN\" /> having tracked the Resistance ships through hyperspace using [[Hyperspace tracker|new technology]]. The armada was an overwhelming [[Navy|naval]] force consisting of thirty ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers led by the ''[[Supremacy]]''&mdash;a titanic [[Mega-class Star Dreadnought|''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought]] that served as the mobile headquarters of the First Order and the flagship of Supreme Leader Snoke.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> Caught off-guard by the seeming impossibility of hyperspace tracking and with only enough [[fuel]] for one more jump, the Resistance vessels turned to flee. Although the ''Ninka'', ''Raddus'', and ''Anodyne'' survived the initial volley from the Star Destroyers, the ''Vigil'' was destroyed and the Resistance's starfighter wing was wiped out before it could launch from Organa's flagship. Before the fleet escaped the destructive range of the Star Destroyers, a squad of [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE fighters]] slipped under the ''Raddus''{{'s}} [[deflector shield]] envelope and fired on the bridge, killing much of [[Resistance High Command]]&mdash;including Admiral Ackbar&mdash;and ejecting General Organa into the [[vacuum]] of space. Although Organa survived through her connection to [[the Force]], she was severely injured and fell into a [[coma]], leaving the Resistance without its unifying commander as it fled the overwhelming might of the enemy.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\nWith most of the Resistance leadership either dead or incapacitated, Vice Admiral Holdo was the highest ranking officer on the fleet and Organa's designated successor in the chain of command.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> She transferred her flag to the ''Raddus'' along with a limited staff and assumed command of the Resistance as the First Order armada continued its pursuit. Holdo's ascension was announced by Commander [[Larma D'Acy]] at a gathering of [[Resistance officer]]s in the ship's secondary battle bridge, to the surprise of several ''Raddus'' crew and personnel who had never served with the vice admiral. In an address broadcasted fleet-wide,<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> Holdo outlined their dire situation&mdash;four hundred survivors on just three ships&mdash;and made clear that the survival of the Resistance was her paramount goal in command.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\n[[File:Amilyn_Holdo_Ellen.png|thumb|right|275px|Amilyn Holdo addresses the Resistance.]]\nHoldo intended to move forward with her and Organa's original plan to head to Crait and regroup, although it required adjustments due to the First Order's ability to track the fleet through hyperspace. Since a direct jump to Crait would reveal their destination and consume the last of their fuel, Holdo instead decided to continue at sublight speed towards the planet and use [[U-55 orbital loadlifter|U-55 orbital transports]] cloaked with Tico's baffler technology to ferry the survivors to the surface while their [[capital ship]]s baited the armada away. Holdo maintained the secrecy that she and Organa had committed to, which immediately brought her into conflict with Poe Dameron. After the vice admiral's address to the fleet, Dameron&mdash;who had been demoted from commander to captain after the loss of Cobalt and Crimson squadrons over D'Qar&mdash;expected Holdo to involve him in command decisions. Holdo instead rebuffed him, stirring suspicion and resentment in the impulsive young pilot.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nDameron quickly went to work devising his own plan to save the fleet, and convinced Rose Tico, Lieutenant [[Kaydel Ko Connix]], and the former stormtrooper [[Finn]] to participate in an effort to deactivate the hyperspace tracker aboard the ''Supremacy'' without Holdo's knowledge. To pursue their mission, Tico and Finn secretly jumped away from the fleet aboard a commandeered [[Resistance transport pod|shuttle]]; although Holdo noticed the departure on the ''Raddus''{{'s}} sensors, Lieutenant Connix convinced the vice admiral that the blip was the result of passing debris.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\nAs Holdo pushed the fleet onward, the ''Raddus'' protected the smaller support ships with its expansive shield envelope, but dwindling fuel resources remained a problem. The medical frigate ''Anodyne'' was the first to deplete its fuel stores, prompting Holdo to order the vessel's evacuation and the transfer of its crew to the ''Raddus''. The decision again provoked anger from Captain Dameron, who confronted Holdo on the flagship's battle bridge and demanded to know what she planned beyond evacuations. Holdo dismissed Dameron once more, insisting that her command would not reflect the kind of risky decision-making that led to the loss of the bombing squadrons over D'Qar.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" /> The ''Anodyne'' was quickly scuttled by Resistance crews, with the final transports of injured patients making it off the vessel just as it lost power and fell outside of the ''Raddus''{{'s}} protective envelope. The medical frigate's [[Unidentified Anodyne pilot|captain]], who remained aboard the vessel after the last evacuation transports departed, sent a final status update communique to Holdo as the ''Anodyne'' was fired upon and destroyed by the ''Supremacy''. With that loss, Lieutenant Connix informed the vice admiral that the fleet had only six remaining hours worth of fuel.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\nThe destruction of the ''Anodyne'' amid the perilous fuel situation had a severe impact on morale, and Dameron blamed Holdo for allowing the Resistance survivors to fall into such low spirits. In response to his outbursts against her leadership, Holdo banned Dameron from the bridge and removed him from duty rosters. Before long, the ''Ninka''{{'s}} fuel was depleted, and Holdo was forced to order the evacuation of the skeleton crew from her own cruiser. The ''Ninka'' was destroyed as soon as it fell outside the ''Raddus''{{'s}} shield envelope, leaving the Resistance flagship as the only remaining combat vessel in the fleet.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nAs the cruiser reached sublight range of Crait, Holdo ordered the ''Raddus''{{'s}} remaining fuel to be transferred to the thirty U-55 orbital transports left in the hangar. As the command and hangar crews carried out her orders, Dameron forced his way back on to the bridge to confront the vice admiral about the morale crisis aboard the ship. Although Holdo was briefly able to calm the captain, Dameron became violent when he saw a monitor providing the status of the shuttle fueling operation. Dameron believed Holdo was planning to abandon ship and put the entire Resistance aboard unarmed and unshielded transports with no hyperdrive ability and no destination, and accused the vice admiral of cowardice and treason. Holdo had fleet security remove Dameron from the bridge, prompting him to move forward with his plans with Finn, Tico, and Lieutenant Connix.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nWhen Holdo went to the hangar to personally oversee the evacuation preparation, Dameron and Connix gathered a group of Resistance pilots to stage a mutiny. Dameron and his crew confronted Holdo in the hangar, explaining to her that he had initiated a plan to have Finn and Tico infiltrate the ''Supremacy'' to shut down the dreadnought's hyperspace tracker. Holdo rejected Dameron's request to delay the evacuation so that his plan could advance, instead ordering the shuttles to begin the boarding process.<ref name=\"TLJ\" /> With her refusal, Dameron and his compatriots&mdash;Connix, [[C'ai Threnalli]], and [[Nodin Chavdri]]<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" />&mdash;drew their [[blaster]]s and announced they were relieving the vice admiral of her command.<ref name=\"TLJ\" /> Although Holdo was supported by officers including Commander D'Acy, [[General]] [[Caluan Ematt]], [[Major]] [[Nossit Cicer]], and Captain [[Geno Namit]],<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> she surrendered to Dameron to avoid battle aboard the ''Raddus''.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\nHoldo and her loyalists were confined to the hangar by Dameron's armed mutineers while the pilot led a small force to seize control of the bridge. The mutiny was short lived, however. As Dameron shut down power to the hangar, the vice admiral kicked a fuel line loose, blasting Threnalli with vapor. Holdo stunned the [[Abednedo]] pilot with her concealed blaster; her compatriots followed her lead, resulting in a shootout in the hangar between her loyal officers and the mutineering pilots. As the ''Raddus'' descended into chaos, General Leia Organa awoke from her coma and personally retook the bridge from Dameron, stunning him and capturing his co-conspirators.<ref name=\"TLJ\" /> In the hangar, Holdo and her forces continued battle with Dameron's supporters as news of Organa's return began to spread. The Resistance fighters were uncertain whose side she would take in the conflict until the general herself arrived in the hangar to stop the fighting. She was accompanied by a cadre of soldiers carrying an unconscious Dameron, and she greeted Holdo with a hug, making clear that the vice admiral retained Organa's confidence and loyalty.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nWith the mutiny put down, Holdo and Organa resumed their plan to secretly evacuate the ''Raddus'' and make for Crait. Holdo took a moment to check on the unconscious Dameron before he was loaded aboard a transport, confiding in Organa that she liked the pilot. As the final transports were loaded, Organa ordered Holdo to board, but the vice admiral refused. She explained that for the transports to escape, someone had to remain aboard the Raddus to lure the First Order fleet away from Crait. Although Organa tried to protest, Holdo reminded the general that she still held technical command of the fleet and therefore outranked her friend, and that \"an admiral goes down with her ship.\" Organa was reluctant to leave her friend aboard the doomed cruiser, but ultimately deferred to Holdo's will. The vice admiral consoled her friend with a final goodbye before the general and the rest of the Resistance departed the ''Raddus'', leaving her behind.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\n====The Holdo maneuver====\n{{Quote|Godspeed, Rebels.|Amilyn Holdo bids farewell to the Resistance|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}\nAlone aboard the ''Raddus'', Vice Admiral Holdo returned to the battle bridge. She had complete control over the massive vessel from her station, with a singular goal to buy the Resistance survivors time to reach Crait and flee. As she watched the U-55 transports slip towards the planet, she reflected on her role, her relationship with Leia Organa, and her Gatalentan faith. Although she expected the First Order armada to pursue the ''Raddus'' until the Mon Calamari cruiser's fuel depleted, the ''Supremacy'' unexpectedly switched targets and opened fire on the unshielded transports bound for Crait. Unknown to the Resistance, Holdo's plan had been leaked to the First Order by way of Dameron's allies, Finn and Rose Tico. Dameron's messages to his compatriots about the situation on the ''Raddus'' were overheard by [[DJ]], a thief and [[slicer]] who was recruited by Finn and Tico in their effort to infiltrate the ''Supremacy''. DJ betrayed his clients after the stormtroopers captured them, buying his freedom with the information he gleaned from Dameron's updates.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nFirst Order gunners, made aware of the low-energy targets headed away from the ''Raddus'', tracked the transports' emissions and opened fire on the Resistance lifeboats. Holdo watched in horror from her station on the bridge as the ''Supremacy'' picked off the vessels with ease. [[Unidentified transport pilot|One of the transport pilots]] contacted Holdo, frantically asking if the convoy should return to the ''Raddus''. Knowing that the transports were too far out from the shield envelope to hope for any protection from their flagship, Holdo ordered them to continue full speed towards Crait planetfall. That pilot and others were killed as more than half the Resistance transport fleet was wiped out by the First Order volley.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\nAlthough Holdo understood that the ''Raddus''{{'s}} shields and armaments were insufficient to save the lifeboats or distract the enemy, she found a potential solution in the cruiser's [[navigation computer]]. Dameron had entered hyperspace jump coordinates when he stormed the bridge; since the ''Raddus'' and its pursuers had continued along their trajectory towards Crait after the mutiny, the entry point for the jump was now located behind the First Order fleet. Although the likelihood of this outcome was infinitesimally small, Holdo hoped she could initiate the hyperspace jump and ram the enemy forces. Understanding it to be her only option, she brought the cruiser about and pointed it directly at the ''Supremacy''. Both Resistance forces on the transports and First Order officers aboard the armada thought that Holdo was preparing to jump in order to flee the battle; the commanders of the ''Supremacy'' realized too late that the cruiser was aimed at the heart of their fleet and posed a significant risk.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\n[[File:HoldoKamikaze.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Holdo's sacrifice devastated the First Order fleet.]]\nHoldo overrode the fail-safes aboard the ''Raddus'' and made the jump. The massive vessel accelerated to nearly the speed of light and impacted the ''Supremacy'' as a lethal projectile bound for hyperspace. Holdo was immediately killed as the tremendous release of energy from the collision converted the ''Raddus''{{'s}} mass into a column of super-heated plasma that vaporized a large portion of the First Order dreadnought's starboard wing. The plasma remnants of Holdo's cruiser continued forward at lightspeed, cracking open the hulls of<ref name=\"TLJ\" /> twenty<ref name=\"Poe 31\">''[[Poe Dameron 31]]''</ref> ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers assembled behind the ''Supremacy'' before being launched into hyperspace.<ref name=\"TLJ\" /> Holdo's historic [[suicide]] run brought a final end to the First Order's prolonged attack and was witnessed by Organa, Dameron, and other Resistance survivors aboard the six remaining transports bound for Crait.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\n===Legacy ===\n{{Quote|Protecting the light was more important to her than looking like a hero.|General Leia Organa, on Holdo|Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition}}\nAmilyn Holdo's sacrifice over Crait saved the Resistance and many of its future leaders.

During the ensuing [[Battle of Crait]], Dameron rallied his compatriots by paraphrasing Holdo's speech to the fleet. He ultimately commanded Resistance forces with a preference for survival tactics over risky heroics, having learned from his experiences with the vice admiral.

He attempted to confess his mutiny to the pilots of [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]], who were away from the Resistance fleet during the D'Qar evacuation and battle at Crait. He instead carried that burden privately until the [[Pirate King|pirate queen]] [[Maz Kanata]] forced him to admit that he was still wrestling with his actions aboard the ''Raddus''. Sometime later, while Dameron and Organa worked to recruit New Republic and Rebel leaders into the Resistance, he was confronted by [[Sanrec Stronghammer]], a veteran of the [[Battle of Jakku]] who had served alongside Holdo. Stronghammer heard of Dameron's mutiny and asserted that the pilot should be imprisoned or executed for his treason. Wracked with guilt and knowing he had to win Stronghammer's trust, Dameron finally admitted to his crimes and accepted responsibility for what occurred on the ''Raddus''. The confession and support from his friends and allies won Stronghammer's trust. Ultimately, Dameron committed to making up for his actions by honoring Holdo's sacrifice.<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\" /> Dameron and Finn, both of whom were saved by Holdo, would remain primary leaders of the Resistance through the end of the war.<ref name=\"Episode IX\">[[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']]</ref>\n\nSometime in the year following the battle at Crait,<ref name=\"WSDate\">{{WildSpaceDate}}</ref> [[cartographer]] [[Emil Graf]] recounted to his droid, [[CR-8R]], the story of Vice Admiral Holdo's ''Ninka'' and Blue Squadron rescuing the Duros pilot Staaysha Dekkr earlier in the war.<ref name=\"Alone in the Dark\" /> Holdo's memory became immortalized by [[35 ABY]], as her lightspeed suicide run on the ''Supremacy'' became known as the [[Holdo maneuver]].

[[Slavery]], which was illegal on Gatalenta, was abhorrent to Holdo, and the young Gatalentan maintained several practices that reflected the spiritual aspects of the culture of her people, including skyfaring calisthenics, [[incense]]-burning, and attendance at meditative retreats.<ref name=\"Leia\" />\n\nLater in life, Holdo more fully embraced the culture of her people, adopting a serene nature and a subdued but elegant wardrobe; however, she still retained a nonconformist streak in her appearance, such as dyeing her hair exotic colors and habitually going barefoot.<ref name=\"The Bridge\" /> Her adherence to Gatalentan culture defied military norms even after she became a member of Resistance high command, where she eschewed typical martial uniforms for floor-length lavender gowns that excluded typical markers like [[Resistance rank badge|rank badges]] and officer [[jacket]]s. She also incorporated several Gatalentan accessories, including [[bracelet]]s that traced local [[constellation]] patterns,<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> [[somatohue earring]]s,<ref name=\"TROS VD\">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> [[ring]]s, and [[Amilyn Holdo's osmium tiara|an]] [[osmium]] [[tiara]] shaped into arcs representing the planet's multiple [[Star|suns]]. Rather than standard Resistance armament, she carried a [[Drearian Defense Conglomerate|DDC]] [[Defender-5 sporting blaster]], which was favored by Gatalentan [[Noble|nobility]].<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" />\n\nIn the final moments before her historic suicide run, Holdo found comfort in her Gatalentan faith, which taught that salvation was not found alone, but alongside all those who had offered love and compassion to her in life.<ref name=\"TLJ EE\" />\n\n===Unconventional commander===\n[[File:Holdo_Candor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Minister Holdo in command on the bridge of the ''Candor'']]\nHoldo was a determined and patriotic person, able to react to changing circumstances and ready to sacrifice herself for the cause. As a commander she had a cool head for the greater strategy, and expected her orders to be executed precisely, as shown during her time in command of the ''Raddus.''<ref name=\"TLJ\" /> According to Dameron, Holdo was recognized within the Resistance as a great strategic mind due to her actions at the [[Battle of Chyron Belt|Battle]] of [[Chyron Belt]]<ref name=\"TLJ\" /> and was admired even by [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar|Ackbar]].<ref name=\"TLJ Junior novel\">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>\n\nDespite having an antagonistic relationship with Dameron, Holdo respected him, telling Organa that Dameron was a troublemaker after his mutiny but that she liked him.<ref name=\"TLJ\" />\n\n== Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|She's somebody who's a bit off-kilter, who sees the world through a prism most others don't understand. At first Leia thinks she's pleasant but weird, but as time goes on, it becomes apparent that there's much more to Holdo than you might guess when you first met her.
