Villie and [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]] made a deal with Gorzima to let them take the ship off Nar Shaddaa, allowing Grahrk to collect his winnings from betting that Vos would get off the moon alive, and to buy the ship back from Gorzima. The Quarren reluctantly agreed, and once they had escaped Nar Shaddaa, Vos made sure that Vilmarh kept his promise.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 20|''Star Wars'' (1998) 20]] {{1st}} {{Hologram}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gorzima\n|pl=Gorzima\n}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Quarren]]"}}}]}}}}
