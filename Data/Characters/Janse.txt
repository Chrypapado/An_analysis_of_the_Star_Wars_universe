By that [[Time/Legends|time]], he was a former sharpshooter<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> who served as a [[Scout/Legends|scout]] during [[Hunting/Legends|hunting]] expeditions.<ref name=\"CCG\" />\n\n===Battle of Endor===\n[[File:STooVees-ROTJ.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Janse (background), attending the briefing aboard ''Home One'']]\nIn 4 ABY,<ref name=\"FF\" /> Janse attended a briefing held on the [[Alliance Fleet]]'s [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser|MC80 ''Home One'' type Star Cruiser]] [[Home One/Legends|''Home One'']], during which [[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]], the Alliance's [[Supreme Commander (Alliance/Republic)|Supreme Commander]], discussed plans to attack the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Death Star II/Legends|second Death Star]] [[battlestation]] in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]] over the [[Endor/Legends|Forest Moon of Endor]]. [[General/Legends|General]] [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]], the Alliance [[Commander/Legends|commander]] in charge of planning the attack, explained that members of a [[Endor strike team/Legends|strike team]] led by General [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] would be sent to Endor to deactivate the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator/Legends|SLD-26 planetary shield generator]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] protecting the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] from frontal assault, which would allow Alliance [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] to destroy the [[Space station/Legends|station's]] [[Hypermatter annihilator|main reactor]].<ref name=\"RotJ\" /> Janse was among the members of the strike team, serving alongside [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Greeve (Human)|Greeve]] as a reactivated sharpshooter.<ref name=\"FF\" />\n\nJanse<ref name=\"FF\" /> and the rest of the strike team traveled to the [[Endor system/Legends|Endor system]] aboard the stolen Imperial [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]] [[Tydirium/Legends|''Tydirium'']], [[Pilot/Legends|piloted]] by Solo. Queried by the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|Super Star Destroyer]] [[Executor/Legends|''Executor'']] in defensive orbit over Endor, Solo gave a stolen Imperial code, and the ''Executor'' provided the [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] clearance to land on the Forest Moon. Shortly after landing on the moon's surface, the strike team waited while Solo and the team's command crew&mdash;[[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], and the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]&mdash;scouted the area ahead to make sure it was clear. In the process, Solo alerted a [[Scout trooper/Legends|scout trooper]] patrol to the strike team's presence, resulting in a [[74-Z speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] chase between Skywalker, Organa, and several of the Imperial scouts.<ref name=\"RotJ\" />\n\nJanse<ref name=\"FF\" /> and the rest of the squad waited until only Skywalker returned. When it became evident that Organa was missing, Solo took the rest of the command crew to search for her, ordering the squad to continue on and to rendezvous at the [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|deflector shield generator]] at 0300 [[Standard hour/Legends|hours]].<ref name=\"RotJ\" /> [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Bren Derlin/Legends|Bren Derlin]], the strike team's [[Commanding officer/Legends|commanding officer]], led the squad toward the [[Deflector shield/Legends|shield]] generator. Several times along the way, the squad encountered Imperial patrols and managed to hide. However, Corporal [[Delevar]], the team's [[Medic/Legends|medic]], almost compromised their position by preparing to take a potshot at a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]]; he was consequently stopped and reprimanded by Derlin.<ref name=\"Night Attack\">{{WEGCite|book=Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi|story=Night Attack|stext=Night Attack}}</ref>\n\nAt nightfall,<ref name=\"Night Attack\" /> Janse<ref name=\"FF\" /> and the squad made camp in a camouflaged shallow ravine, where they posted two sentries and set up a [[blanket grid]] with their [[Scanner|scanning]] equipment. Shortly after the squad members started their first [[Sleep/Legends|sleeping]] shift, the scanners picked up an [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|All Terrain Scout Transport]] [[Walker/Legends|walker]] moving toward them. Derlin ordered the team to take cover, but when it became clear that the walker would not pass them by, Corporal [[Dansra Beezer]] [[Jammer|jammed]] its transmissions. Lieutenant Greeve destroyed both of the walker's spotlights with precise shots<ref name=\"Night Attack\" /> from his A280 [[Blaster rifle/Legends|blaster rifle]],<ref name=\"CCG2\" /> and the squad circled the walker in order to keep it off balance. When the AT-ST began to fire randomly into the [[Tree/Legends|trees]] and foliage, Delevar fired a [[Smoke canister/Legends|smoke canister]] into its [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]] [[Window/Legends|window]]. The resulting explosion forced the walker pilots to abandon the vehicle and surrender to the strike team. The squad captured the pilots and forced them to make a [[Comm unit/Legends|comm]] check-in at [[Blaster/Legends|blasterpoint]].<ref name=\"Night Attack\" />\n\n[[File:Tempestforce.png|thumb|right|250px|Tempest Force, the Imperial legion stationed on Endor]]\nThe squad continued on to the rendezvous point, forcing the walker pilot to make several more check-ins on the way to explain the scout walker's absence.<ref name=\"Night Attack\" /> By the time the strike team reunited, Solo and the rest of the command crew had allied with the moon's native [[Ewok/Legends|Ewok]] tribe from [[Bright Tree Village/Legends|Bright Tree Village]], who showed the strike team a path to the [[Endor shield generator bunker|shield generator bunker's]] back door. The strike team then infiltrated the bunker in order to destroy it with<ref name=\"RotJ\" /> [[7-PrG proton grenade]]s;<ref name=\"EG\">''[[The Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology]]''</ref> however, they were subsequently ambushed and led outside the bunker by [[Tempest Force]], the [[Imperial Army/Legends|Imperial Army]] [[Legion/Legends|legion]] stationed on the moon.<ref name=\"RotJ\" />\n\nThe strike team's capture was only temporary, however, as the Ewoks attacked the Imperial [[Troop/Legends|troops]] and the strike team fought back, with the tide of the battle eventually turning in the Rebels' favor. The surviving members of the strike team ultimately destroyed the shield generator bunker with their [[Proton grenade/Legends|proton grenades]], allowing the Alliance Fleet to destroy the Death Star as planned.<ref name=\"RotJ\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nJanse was a sharpshooter and served the Rebel Alliance in that capacity.<ref name=\"CCG\" /> Using his skills from his time as a weapons design evaluator, Janse aided the Alliance as a scout and hunter.<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> Janse had [[Color/Legends|gray]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and fair skin.<ref name=\"RotJ\"
