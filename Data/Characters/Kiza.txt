And so do you. Tell everyone the Acolytes are coming, doll.|Kiza|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\n'''Kiza''' was a [[Pantoran]] [[Gender|female]] member of the [[Acolytes of the Beyond]]. During the [[Coronet City revolution]] on [[Corellia]] in the [[Standard month|months]] following the [[Battle of Endor]], Kiza freed a fellow acolyte, [[Remi]], from the [[Peace and Security Headquarters|Peace and Security station]] in the [[city]]. After freeing the boy, they [[Death|killed]] all but [[Erno|one]] of the [[detective]]s in the station. Kiza later took part in an [[Attack on a New Republic outpost|attack]] on a [[New Republic]] outpost on [[Devaron]]. During that attack, she wore the [[Mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard|mask]] of [[Viceroy]] [[Exim Panshard]]. Consumed by the [[dark side of the Force]], she killed her lover Remi.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Coronet City revolution===\nKiza grew up in a lowborn [[Pantoran]] [[Kiza's family|family]] in the impoverished parts of [[Coronet City]] on the planet [[Corellia]]. Throughout her life, Kiza harbored rage at her perceived \"oppressors\": the [[peace officer]]s who hassled her, the [[chits-and-debits office]] that pursued her family's debts, and the highborn [[Corellian]]s who looked down on her lowborn origins. During her adolescence, Kiza began to experience [[Force vision]]s. Following the Battle of Endor, she was recruited by a man from the [[Acolytes of the Beyond]], a cult of non-[[Force-sensitive]] individuals that revered the [[Sith]] and the [[dark side of the Force]].<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nBuilding her way up the ranks, Kiza initially started off tagging walls with the [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] mask sigil and the warning \"VADER LIVES\". She also stole [[credit]]s and tithed them to the cause. Kiza also scouted locations for dead-drops of safe meetings. In the months after the Battle of [[Endor]], Kiza developed romantic feelings for a youth named [[Remi]], who shared her passion for the dark side. Prior to the [[Coronet City revolution]], the Acolytes assigned Kiza with the task of infiltrating the local [[Peace and Security Headquarters|Peace and Security station]]. They created a false identity which allowed her to pose as secretary.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nDuring the Coronet City revolution, Kiza killed several Corellian peace officers with a [[blaster]]. When the detective [[Erno]] demanded to know what was going on, she told him that she was no longer his doll.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Meanwhile, Remi retrieved a Sith [[lightsaber]] from the archives beneath the station.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" /> Before Erno could subdue Kiza, Remi cut off his blaster hand with the lightsaber. Kiza then clubbed Erno on the head and told him that Vader lived. She spared his life so that he could warn the others that the Acolytes were coming.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n===Attack on the Devaron outpost===\n{{Quote|This is a revolution. This is the revenge of the darkness. This is oblivion.|Kiza|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\nPrior to the [[Battle of Jakku]], Kiza and her fellow Acolytes regrouped on the [[Colonies]] world of [[Devaron]]. They took part in an [[Attack on a New Republic outpost|attack]] on a [[New Republic]] outpost in the [[Karatokai Mountains]]. This attack was part of a coordinate series of attacks on New Republic outposts throughout [[the galaxy]]. Her cell group was led by [[Yupe Tashu]], a former Adviser to the late [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]. During that time, Kiza came to doubt whether she was strong as Remi, who had become besotted with the Sith lightsaber he had obtained on Corellia.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nAfter communing with the spirits of fallen Sith, Tashu gifted the [[Mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard|mask]] of [[Viceroy]] [[Exim Panshard]] to Kiza. When Remi expressed jealousy and demanded the mask, Tashu chastised him for angering the specters. As punishment, he confiscated the lightsaber from Remi. The Acolytes then launched a surprise attack on the New Republic outpost. During the assault, Kiza struck down several New Republic personnel with her lightsaber, including slicing the legs off a fleeing woman.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nKiza also allowed the dark side influence within the mask to consume her mind and body. Remi took advantage of the chaos to try and recover his lightsaber. He managed to knock her to the ground, causing her to drop her lightsaber. While struggling against Remi, Kiza managed to find the blade and jammed the unignited blade against Remi's temple. She then ignited the blade through his skull, killing him. After adjusting her mask, Kiza rejoined the attack on the New Republic outpost, now fully consumed by the dark side.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nKiza endured poverty and humiliation during her childhood. This fueled her anger and hatred. Despite not being Force-sensitive, Kiza experienced Force visions of the Sith. Kiza later joined a dark side sect called the Acolytes of the Beyond, who revered the Sith. As an Acolyte, Kiza learned to channel her hatred and anger. Her initial contributions to the group included tagging walls with the Vader mask sigil and the message \"VADER LIVES.\" As she rose through the ranks, Kiza took part in killing enemies of the Acolytes including peace officers. As a Pantoran, Kiza was regarded as attractive by humans like Erno.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nFollowing the Coronet City revolution, Kiza was chosen by fallen Sith spectres to bear the mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard and Remi's stolen lightsaber. Giving in completely to the dark side, she slew numerous New Republic personnel. When Remi tried to reclaim his blade, Kiza slew him in a fit of rage and hatred.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nKiza first appeared as a tertiary character in [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2016]] novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''. She was given a brief point-of-view chapter in the novel's [[2017]] sequel ''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' {{1st|[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''\n*[[Aftermath: Empire's End (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Empire's End'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|el=\u039a\u03af\u03b6\u03b1\n|ru=\u041a\u0438\u0437\u0430\n|pl=Kiza\n}}\n\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Members of the Acolytes of the Beyond]]\n[[Category:Pantorans]]"}}}]}}}}
