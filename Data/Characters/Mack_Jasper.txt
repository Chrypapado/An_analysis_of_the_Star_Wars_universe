He was a proficient officer of the [[Corellian Security Force]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Lt. Jasper? Ah yes, I remember him. Is he still with CorSec?

Something like that.|A gadget specialist|Star Wars Galaxies}}\nBy the time following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Mack Jasper was a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] of the Corellian Security Force, stationed in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]].<ref name=\"SWG:WfC\" /> He was a friend of the CorSec [[Agent/Legends|agent]] [[Hurley Klakk]].<ref name=\"SWG:DtMGitCCB\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Destroy the Mechanized Guardians in the Chirq Council Bunker|Corellia}}</ref>\n\nWorking for CorSec, Jasper once tried to arrest an undercover [[Imperial Security Bureau/Legends|ISB]] agent, who carried the [[Codex of Tython]], an item of value for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. However, the Imperial was not ready to give the item up, and after a brief fight Jasper was disarmed and defeated. The agent was in a hurry, so he simply left Jasper sitting on the ground and went on his business.<ref>{{SWGTCG|set=Champions of the Force (SWGTCG)|text=Champions of the Force|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}</ref>\n\n===The Rogue Corsec plot against the Diktat===\n{{Quote|I'm always looking for someone who can help me get things done.

The spacer identified the [[Ragtags]] as responsible, hoping to blame the [[Meatlumps]] and get them into trouble.<ref name=\"SWG:CSV\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Coronet Starport Vandalism|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MackJasper.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lieutenant Mack Jasper conducting business in [[Coronet City/Legends|Coronet City]].]]\nLieutenant Jasper once asked the spacer to investigate a missing shipment of starship components ordered by the company known as [[Ral Mundi's Starship Emporium]].<ref name=\"SWG:FtMSOSC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Find the Missing Shipment of Starship Components|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer discovered that the shipment was stolen by the Ragtag gang and was able to retrieve it in the [[Coronet Capitol]]. More strikingly, the spacer also found a crate of illegal [[Spice/Legends|spice]]. The spacer reported to Lieutenant Jasper who decided to investigate the case.<ref name=\"SWG:RtMSC\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Reacquire the Missing Starship Component Shipment|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer thus infiltrated the Capitol and worked for [[Gallura Handerin]], a government aide,<ref name=\"SWG:WftG\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Working for the Government|Corellia}}</ref> and [[Brantlee Spondoon]], the aide to the Diktat. During that time, an [[Information broker/Legends|informant]] contacted Spondoon to discuss a plot against the Diktat. Even if the Rogue CorSec managed to assassinate the informant in a Coronet [[Warehouse (Coronet City)|warehouse]], Lieutenant Jasper and the spacer discovered the Rogue CorSec implication in that plot.<ref name=\"SWG:HGtII\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Help Get the Informant's Information|Corellia}}</ref> From one of Jasper's informant named [[Jonset]], the spacer later learnt that the Rogues were working with the Ragtags.

The gadget specialist also helped Lieutenant Jasper to localize the origin of the transmission.<ref name=\"SWG:SOtGS\">{{SWGcite|exp=SK|type=general|Seek Out the Gadget Specialist|Corellia}}</ref> The spacer tracked the signal to the [[Rogue CorSec Base]] and infiltrated the base.
