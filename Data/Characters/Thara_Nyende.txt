The rest of this city didn't. Don't get everyone caught in the crossfire.|Thara Nyende, to Hazram Namir|Battlefront: Twilight Company}}\n'''Thara Nyende''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] [[stormtrooper]] [[Homeworld|hailing]] from the [[planet]] [[Sullust]]. Nyende's [[Operating number|designation]] was '''SP-475''' and she served in the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Imperial Ninety-Seventh Stormtrooper Legion|Ninety-Seventh Stormtrooper Legion]] stationed on Sullust. When [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|rebels]] infiltrated the [[city]] of [[Pinyumb]], she captured the rebel [[Hazram Namir]]. When attempting to take him to the [[Imperial Garrison (Sullust)|Imperial garrison]], however, they were attacked by the rebel operative [[Nien Nunb]], who saved Namir. During the [[Siege of Inyusu Tor]], Nyende was in a hospital bed and attempted to keep the Sullustan staff from joining the local uprising. Her attempt made no difference, though, and Pinyumb was liberated from the Empire.\n\n==Biography==\n===Seeds of rebellion===\n{{Quote|Uncle! I'm here to spoil you.''\"<br />\"''The only person getting ''spoiled'' is you.|Thara Nyende greets her uncle|Battlefront: Twilight Company}}\nThara Nyende was born on the [[planet]] [[Sullust]] and lived in its [[capital]], [[Pinyumb]]. She helped fix things when she was a teenager.<ref name=\"Twilight\" /> In [[2 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date\">The section of ''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]'' where Thara Nyende appears and her enlistment into the [[Imperial Ninety-Seventh Stormtrooper Legion]] is mentioned is set twenty-two [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Clone Wars]], which [[Mission to Mustafar|ended]] in [[19 BBY]], according to ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''. The her appearance, as well as the mention, must have therefore happened in [[3 ABY]]. Furthermore, it is also established that Nyende enlisted for the [[legion]] a year prior, which can be dated to [[2 ABY]].</ref> she enlisted to the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Stormtrooper Corps]]. With the intention of helping her [[Thara Nyende's mother|mother]], [[Thara Nyende's uncle|uncle]] and cousins with the high pay, she trained up as a [[cadet]] and joined the ranks of the [[Imperial Ninety-Seventh Stormtrooper Legion]], receiving the designation \"SP-475\". Nyende was paid twice as much as the most of the workers at Pinyumb. She sometimes donated supplies to the ones who visited her uncle's [[cantina]].<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nOn [[Standard day|day]],<ref name=\"Twilight\" /> in [[3 ABY]],<ref name=\"Date\" /> Nyende was delivering supplies to her uncle's cantina. After they were handed out, she drew closer to the [[holotable]]. She over heard several people talking about the [[Cobalt Laborers' Reformation Front]], a protest group opposing the Empire on Sullust. As they quarreled on whether the group were right about their cause, another older Sullustan claimed the Empire had taken their freedom. Nyende decided to leave at this point and went to the [[Imperial Garrison (Sullust)|Imperial garrison]] to put on her [[stormtrooper armor]].<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n===Pinyumb raids===\n{{Quote|You think anyone died? At the facility, I mean.''\"<br />\"''Not in the report. Probably not.''\"<br />\"''You think our side killed anyone, down there?|SP-156 and SP-475|Battlefront: Twilight Company}}\nAlmost three [[Standard week|weeks]] later, Nyende was present for the inspection of her group of stormtroopers. After inspecting the troopers, the [[lieutenant]] briefed them on the Cobalt Front, whose protests had lost them eighty percent of their membership to Imperial custody. The lieutenant claimed there was now evidence that the group was trying to affiliate with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], an armed rebellion that was at war with the Empire. He listed several Alliance members with known ties to Sullust, including [[Nien Nunb]], [[Sian Tevv]] and [[Corjentain Malaqua]]. As he began to explain the rebels' possible intentions, the lieutenant received reports through his ear piece about an attack. The garrisons alarms sounded and the lieutenant began briefing the stormtroopers on the new situation.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nWhile more experienced teams were to the [[Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility]] in response to the attack, an apparent sabotage, Nyende spent the day blocking streets and searching civilians. Raid warrants were issued by the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] in the afternoon. Upon signal, Nyende and many other stormtroopers surrounded certain areas and searched civilians. She did not find any weapons or bombs, only a black-market [[holovid]]s and Cobalt Front pamphlets. Nyende was later assigned to sentry duty at a [[tram]] station with the stormtrooper [[SP-156]]. 156 asked her questions which she tried to respond to professionally, deeming them beneath regulations in her mind.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nOnce her shift was over, Nyende returned to her uncle with more supplies to donate out. The cantina was full of fearful civilians who the Security Bureau had forced out of their homes. Uneasy about this, Nyende handed over her bag of supplies and began to leave. As she left, though, she impulsively scanned the crowd for any suspicious items. She noticed fresh supplies that had not some from her. The thought of this made her fear that someone with better resources was supplying them.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n===Boarding the ''Keepsake''===\n{{Quote|Detonator!|A stormtrooper warns Thara Nyende and the rest of their group|Battlefront: Twilight Company}}\nNyende reported the influx of supplies in the hands of the Sullustans she scanned. As a result her uncle was taken into custody a week later, but was not charged. Although he would be free eventually, Nyende still received bitter looks from his friends. In the two weeks since the attack, the Empire enacted anti-terrorism policies that heightened stormtrooper security in Pinyumb.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nFifteen days after the attack, the Security Bureau targeted a suspected rebel vessel. Nyende and SP-156 were among the twelve stormtroopers sent to board it. Swiftly, they entered the docking bay and surrounded their target, the [[VCX-150 freighter]] ''[[Keepsake]]''. Nyende was the second among eight troopers to enter the [[starship]]. They then began searching the dozen rooms. The lead stormtrooper, [[SP-113]], ordered all equipment to be locked down to ready the ship for forensic technicians.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n156 then stepped away from the group and inspected a conduit access panel across the corridor to them. He studied it for a moment, before bashing it off with his rifle, revealing a [[Unidentified Chadra-Fan|Chadra-Fan]] hiding inside the cramped compartment. 113 questioned it, demanding the whereabouts of Nien Nunb and the contacts of the Sullustan resistance. The [[Chadra-Fan]] claimed they were working alone and told 113 Nunb was in the city. 113 ordered him to be taken away, and Nyende stepped back to watch three stormtroopers move in to restrain the Chadra-Fan. Suddenly, the [[alien]] set off a [[detonator]] and set it off. Nyende hesitated to move and was barely able to spin around before the explosion sent her hurling down the boarding ramp.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n===Rebel assault===\nNyende was among the few who survived the explosion. She suffered headaches in the following days, but was cleared for light duty within two weeks. On her first day back, 113, who had also survived the incident, approached her in the armory. He looked through her records and told her to return to patrol sooner.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nShortly after, Nyende joined many more stormtroopers to oversee the arrival of a transport carrying Imperial reinforcements to Sullust. One of the maintenance crew claimed it was oversight for a production increase to make up for a rebel [[Attack on Mardona III|attack]] on the planet [[Mardona III]]. As Nyende watched the reinforcements pass her, a high pitched whine broke out in her helmet. Trying to make sense of her surroundings, she saw another trooper gesture behind her. She turned around and spotted a small [[cam droid]]. With her rifle, Nyende shot at it three times and it fell to the ground. Two stormtroopers inspected the small droid and 113 congratulated her for shooting it down.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nOver the next three weeks, Nyende worked ten [[Standard hour|hour]] shifts. More transports arrived carrying reinforcements and the processing facility was being overworked. The situation worsened however. An entire rebel [[company]]&mdash;the [[61st Mobile Infantry]]&mdash;arrived at Sullust and attacked the facility, liberating it within twelve hours. Nyende was sent to patrol the mountain during the night.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nThe next day, Nyende was stationed in the security office of [[Pinyumb Transport Station Four]]. She briefly took off her helmet to chew a [[Ration pack|ration]] when more orders came through her [[comlink]]. The 61st's [[CR90 corvette]], the ''[[Thunderstrike]]'' had returned to swiftly collect them. Nyende cramped into a [[Turbolift|cargo lift]] with twenty other stormtroopers and they rose to the surface to deal with the emergency. When they got out of the lift, [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] had damaged the [[corvette]]. Nyende witnessed it plummet the other side of the mountain, erupting a large explosion.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n===The curfew===\n{{Quote|This is SP-Four-Seven-Five. We have a rebel prisoner incoming.|Thara Nyende takes Hazram Namir into custody|Battlefront: Twilight Company}}\nAs a result of the sudden rebel presence, Pinyumb was locked down and massive roundup began. On the second night after the rebels became stranded, they sent a scout party down to Pinyumb to make contact with the Sullustan resistance. Nyende soon responded to a skirmish in the streets of the city. Two rebel scouts were killed and another, named [[Hazram Namir]], was knocked unconscious under rubble. Nyende's helmet was damaged by a stray shot. She then inspected the unconscious rebel, who had now been under the rubble for an hour, and decided to take him into custody.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nAs the stormtroopers took Namir away on a speeder, Nyende asked him to tell her what the rebels were planning. The rebel refused to answer, but before she could keep trying, another problem formed. Nunb, who was positioned on a roof, shot at the stormtroopers, quickly gunning one of them down. Namir bowled over Nyende's comrade and a barrage of blaster shots showered the speeder bed, injuring Nyende. The rebel then clambered out and ran towards Nunb, quickly disappearing.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n===Liberation of Pinyumb===\n{{Quote|As long as this place is under my protection, it still belongs to the Empire.|Nyende holds two medics at gunpoint|Battlefront: Twilight Company}}\nWithin [[Standard minute|minutes]], a medical evacuation arrived and rushed Nyende to the garrison's emergency ward. There, she had her wound tended to and was soon taken to a civilian clinic the next day. Later that day, the Imperial garrison [[Siege of Inyusu Tor|attacked]] the rebels at the processing facility. Medics at Nyende's clinic started talking about opening the clinic to the civilians again. Nyende climbed into her boots and collected her blaster. She left her bed and entered the corridor where she found that one of the medics was talking to Malaqua. She held them at gunpoint to keep them from conspiring with the rebel again.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\nLate in the day, Nyende received news that the garrison had been flooded with lava. The rebels on the mountain had defeated the local forces. An uprising led by the Sullustan resistance and the Cobalt Front quickly liberated Pinyumb. Nyende surrendered to the rebels without resisting. Her uncle was finally released by the rebels and he used his cantina as a distribution point for donated supplies. Due to the amount of Imperial captives, Nyende was put to work under the supervision of another worker. She intended to rejoin the Stormtrooper Corps if the Empire returned, but hesitated when thinking about turning her rifle against the patrons at her uncle's cantina.<ref name=\"Twilight\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|Thara developed out of conversations with my editor and the folks at Disney, who suggested adding a \"ground level\" Imperial point-of-view character during outlining.
