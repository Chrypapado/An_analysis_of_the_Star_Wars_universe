Calrissian intended to rescue his friend [[Lobot]]<ref name=\"Star Wars 3\" /> and sabotage Cloud City's operations to prevent the Empire from receiving any benefit.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\" /> In doing so, Calrissian had the byproducts from tibanna processing released back into the [[atmosphere]], contaminating the supply. The [[technician]] noticed the issue, reporting it to [[Captain]] [[Tanch]] of the Empire, but was unable to prevent it. Tanch ordered the technician to shut off the venting, but was locked out of the system by Lobot, who had been connected to the city's [[Central Processing]] after the Empire took control.<ref name=\"Star Wars 3\" /> The [[stormtrooper]]s that Tanch sent down to Central Processing failed to succeed in taking control, allowing Calrissian to continue contaminating the tibanna that surrounded the city.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4\" />\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars (2020) 3|''Star Wars'' (2020) 3]] {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (2020) 4|''Star Wars'' (2020) 4]] {{Voice}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bespinites]]\n[[Category:Technicians]]\n[[Category:Unidentified humans]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
