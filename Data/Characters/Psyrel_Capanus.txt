He had wealth and ambition, and overlooked the faults of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]], like most typical citizens of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. He was keen to provide references to [[Phelar University Archive]] to any visiting scholars, who asked him for it.\n\nIn around [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Capanus was assaulted by two security guards of the campus. The reasons remained unclear, but it had something to do with one guard's brother dealing contraband. Other scholars noticed the fight, but they feared of getting involved.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{FFG|book=Star Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook|text=''Star Wars: Force and Destiny'' Core Rulebook|story=Lessons from the Past|stext=''Lessons from the Past''}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Star Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook|''Star Wars: Force and Destiny'' Core Rulebook]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Capanus, Psyrel}}\n[[Category:Eriaduans]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
