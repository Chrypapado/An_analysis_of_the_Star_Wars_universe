We have all been deceived. King Rash is a traitor who has sold Onderon to the Separatists for the crown. But Onderon is ours.|Steela Gerrera|The Soft War}}\n'''Steela Gerrera''' was a [[Gender|female]] [[Onderonian]] [[human]] who lived on the [[planet]] [[Onderon]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. She fought with the [[Onderon rebels]], and was their leader, taking the position from her older brother [[Saw Gerrera]]. The efforts of her movement, with assistance from the [[Jedi]], saw the end of [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] rule through their proxy, [[Sanjay Rash|King Sanjay Rash]], on Onderon and the restoration of the benevolent [[Ramsis Dendup|King Ramsis Dendup]]. She was romantically involved with the Onderon-born politician [[Lux Bonteri]]. Gerrera was killed in the [[Onderonian Civil War|final battle]] against Onderon's droid garrison and was mourned as a hero of her people.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Clone Wars===\n====Battle of Onderon====\nWhen the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] took control of [[Onderon]], Gerrera, [[Gender|her]] brother [[Saw Gerrera|Saw]] and other insurgents then fled into Onderon's wilderness. There, she and the other insurgents organized themselves into a [[Onderon rebels|resistance force]]. After her brother and former Separatist [[Senator]] [[Lux Bonteri]] contacted the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]],<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" /> she then met the council's envoy, [[Jedi]] [[Jedi Master|Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Jedi Knight|Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], his [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], and [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]].<ref name=\"Bio gallery\">{{Databank|steela-gerrera-biography-gallery|Steela Gerrera Biography Gallery|archivedate=20190910170431}}</ref>\n\nGerrera then brought them to their camp, where she, Bonteri, her brother and the other insurgents were trained. At first Gerrera did not like the idea of off-worlders being involved in Onderon's affairs. However, she knew that was how [[Ramsis Dendup]] was deposed of by [[Sanjay Rash]].<ref name=\"Bio gallery\" /> During their training, Gerrera proved herself as a talented sharpshooter. After eliminating a detachment of the [[Separatist Droid Army|droid army]], Gerrera and the others planned to infiltrate the [[capital]] of [[Iziz]] by posing as [[Hunting|hunters]] and foragers. She and the others then split up to gather supplies and meet during the night.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" />\n\nGerrera knew they needed to win the people's trust. Thus, Gerrera planned an attack on the [[Onderon power generator|power generators]]. She, her brother and Bonteri then took out a [[droid]] patrol that then summoned a [[Armored Assault Tank Mk I|AAT]]. Together, they took the [[Tank (vehicle)|tank]] to the generators and destroyed them. Gerrera was then elected leader of the resistance, much to the chagrin of her brother.<ref name=\"Front Runners\">{{TCW|Front Runners}}</ref> Steela then sent out a broadcast to the people, speaking out against Rash and the separatist occupation forces. When news came that Rash planned on [[Death|executing]] Dendup, Gerrera knew they did not have the resources to rescue him right away. She planned on rescuing him during his execution, but her brother was then captured by [[General]] [[Kalani]]'s guards. During the execution, Gerrera and the others were able to stop the execution, but were then surrounded by [[battle droid]]s. However, her brother was able to convince [[Royal Onderon Militia|Royal Militia]]<ref name=\"Soft War\">{{TCW|The Soft War}}</ref> General [[Akenathen Tandin]]<ref name=\"TCW CE\">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!]]''</ref> and his men to help them escape and free Onderon.<ref name=\"Soft War\" /> Gerrera, her resistance, and the Royal Militia then fled to the [[Onderon highlands|Highlands]].<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\n====Death====\nSteela, Ahsoka, and Lux arrived just in time to save the king from the droids. On the nearby battle field, Saw shot down the last of the enemy gunships, but the damaged unit careened out of control, right into the rebel camp. Steela was trapped on a collapsing rock on the edge of a cliffside, broken loose by the droid's impact, and while trying to jump to safety, she was caught hanging from the cliff. Lux rushed to save her, but nearly fell off himself. Ahsoka used the Force to float him to safety, but as she tried to do the same for Steela, the downed gunship fired a laser blast through Ahsoka's left shoulder, breaking her concentration and causing Steela to inadvertently fall to her death.<ref name=\"Tipping Points\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Is that your sister?\"<br>\"Steela.
