Impressed by his [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-potential and his brilliant mind, Jinn decided, after some brief hesitation, to bring Xanatos to the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to see if he could be [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]].<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" /><ref name=\"Captive Temple\" /> In doing so, Xanatos was taken away from the three things he loved most at an early age: [[Crion]], his father; [[Nason]], his sister; and [[Telos IV]], his home planet.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" /><ref name=\"Dark Side 2\">''[[Jedi\u2014The Dark Side 2]]''</ref> Crion gave his consent for Xanatos to leave for the Jedi Order.

He encouraged Xanatos to help him proving that the Toprawans and the Antarian Rangers were involved in the recent events, though Xanatos had still resentment towards his father, perceiving that he left him behind and he neglected. He spent some time with his sister, Nason, meanwhile, Qui-gon was investigating the incident after sensing that [[Dairoki|Liora's killer]] was a Jedi yet not a Jedi, during a main event Nason was murdered by the insurgents that tried to raid the place, this angered Xanatos towards not only the insurgents but towards his master too since he wasn't able to stop anything.<ref name=\"Dark Side 3\">''[[Jedi\u2014The Dark Side 3]]''</ref> On top of that a lightsaber was found in one of the insurgents corpses making the connection with the Antarian Rangers more believable, unknown to Qui-gon the lightsaber was placed there by [[Unidentified Antarian Ranger|a collaborator]] of none other than the failed Jedi Dairoki, who at the same time was not only Liora's killer but Crion Benefactor. Crion tried to convince his son to join him once again, telling him about his desire to unite Telos and the pride of their family, Xanatos sided with his father in the civil war, thus failing his final test.<ref name=\"Dark Side 4\">''[[Jedi\u2014The Dark Side 4]]''</ref> Under Crion's direction, he sabotaged the first meeting to rally the Telosians against [[Toprawa/Legends|Toprawa]].<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" /> But as [[Dairoki]] accidentally confirmed having committed crimes in Crion's name, [[Hukowl An Devi]], one of the governor's top advisers, revealed the truth to the people of Telos. [[Telosian Civil War|Civil war]] soon broke out.<ref name=\"Dark Side 5\">''[[Jedi\u2014The Dark Side 5]]''</ref> Xanatos was said to have been appointed as the head of the Telosian army.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nJinn went after Crion himself, hoping to rescue Xanatos from the madness his father had caused, but the governor attempted to duel Jinn instead. Xanatos watched in terror as his former master rushed to Padawan Tamarik's rescue, thus destroying the [[Sword/Legends|sword]] Crion wielded and knocking the governor into the decorative fires of his palace. Crion died instantly. Jinn tried to apologize, but Xanatos' inextinguishable anger at his father's death caused him to turn to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]]. He picked up his father's burning right hand from the nearby fireplace and pressed the ring (which had been cut by Jinn's lightsaber) to his right cheek.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" /><ref name=\"Dark Side 5\" /> The broken-circle scar later became his \"trademark\" and the symbol for the [[Offworld Mining Corporation]], a company he took control of through deceit and conspiracy.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" /> Before Xanatos and Qui-Gon could fight each other, the rioters stormed the palace and Xanatos was forced to escape.<ref name=\"Dark Side 5\" /> He stole the Telosian treasury and fled the planet on a transport.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nJinn told the Council that he had \"died\" in the fighting on Telos.<ref name=\"Dark Side 5\" /> It was also symbolic as he intended to disrupt Jinn's life and the lives of others he could exploit. Xanatos would go on to stir up trouble for Qui-Gon Jinn and his new apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in the years preceding the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]].<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\n===Taking over Telos===\n{{Quote|Our most benevolent benefactor. He's done a lot for Telos.|[[Denetrus]], reflecting on Xanatos' seemingly noble deeds|Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning}}\nAt some time after the civil war had ended, Xanatos became the first citizen of Telos. His first order of business was to \"investigate\" his late father's deeds and made fraudulent evidence to clear Crion's name. He became a hero to his fellow Telosians and possessed immense influence within the government, including the current [[Governor of Telos]].<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nXanatos became the head of the Offworld Corporation, which was mining in Telos' restoration areas, such as the [[Park of Sacred Pools]]. He distracted the citizens with a gambling project supposedly controlled by the government called [[Katharsis]], which would provide \"tax breaks.\" The profits from Katharsis were supposedly used for the restoration of Telos; he supported libraries, parks, [[Medcenter/Legends|medcenters]], and founded a [[Xanatos Institute for Healing|healing institute]] named after him in Thani. In truth, Offworld, under the name of [[UniFy]], controlled Katharsis, which was fixed so the winner was only given a fraction of the credits and the rest, including profits, were used by Offworld to conduct its mining programs. Any political group who spoke out against UniFy, such as the [[Preserve Our Wild Endangered Resources Party|POWER party]], was outlawed.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nAround [[45 BBY/Legends|45]] and [[44 BBY/Legends|44 BBY]], Xanatos learned from [[Treasurer of Telos]] [[Vox Chun]] that the latter's son, [[Bruck Chun|Bruck]], was training at the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" /><ref name=\"Deceptions\">''[[Jedi Apprentice Special Edition: Deceptions]]''</ref> Somehow, he had managed to get a hold of the boy's file and filled his head with ambition, just as his father had done to him years ago. No doubt, Chun would one day prove useful to Xanatos in the future.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\n===Family man===\n{{Quote|My father protected me.|[[Granta Omega]] to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]|Jedi Quest: The Shadow Trap}}\nAt some point in the early rise of his career, Xanatos met a woman named [[Tura Omega]]. They had an affair and later conceived a son, [[Granta Omega|Granta]]. Xanatos had hoped that the boy would inherit his [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force sensitivity]], but he had learned otherwise. Nonetheless, in his will, he intended to leave everything, including Offworld, to his own prodigy.<ref name=\"Shadow Trap\">''[[Jedi Quest: The Shadow Trap]]''</ref>\n\nWhen Granta turned three, Xanatos sent him and Tura into hiding on [[Nierport VII]],<ref name=\"Shadow Trap\" /> a moon orbiting [[Eeropha]]. Tura worked at a refueling station to support Granta.<ref name=\"Master of Disguise\">''[[Jedi Quest: The Master of Disguise]]''</ref> Xanatos confided his past&mdash;his pure hatred of the Jedi and Qui-Gon Jinn&mdash;to Granta and taught him a few of his tricks, such as the \"back door\" strategy<ref name=\"Shadow Trap\" /> and his own modus operandi: ''Disruption + Demoralization + Distraction = Devastation'',<ref name=\"False Peace\">''[[Jedi Quest: The False Peace]]''</ref> a maxim inspired by a tyrant in a previous mission that Xanatos underwent with Jinn at age sixteen.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\n===The Final Campaign===\n====Bandomeer====\n{{Quote|If you are reading this, I suppose I underestimated you. I won't next time. I enjoyed our adventure together, Master. I am certain you will have the pleasure of meeting me again.|Xanatos' farewell message to Qui-Gon Jinn|Jedi Apprentice: The Dark Rival}}\n[[File:Xanatos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Xanatos [[Mission to Bandomeer|engaged]] his former master on Bandomeer.]]\nIn 44 BBY, Xanatos was contacted by [[VeerTa]], head of the [[Home Planet Mine]] on [[Bandomeer/Legends|Bandomeer]]. Hoping to make a profit, the Meerian told Xanatos that she had discovered [[ionite]]. In return, Xanatos said that if Offworld took control of the mines, it would be \"for the good of Bandomeer.\" But it was far from the truth. While \"galactically insignificant,\" Bandomeer would make him and Offworld very wealthy.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nSeeing an opportunity to enact his revenge on Qui-Gon Jinn, Xanatos arranged a backup plan, in case his scheme for profiting off Bandomeer didn't succeed. He arranged VeerTa to sneak Offworld mining supplies into storage rooms of the [[Agricultural Corps/Legends|Agricultural Corps's]] [[Agri-Corps Enrichment Zone|Enrichment Zones]] and hid it with coated [[Transparisteel/Legends|transparasteel]] made from his homeworld of Telos IV. What VeerTa didn't know was that among the items were [[Ion bomb/Legends|ion bombs]], which encased in boxes imprinted with the broken circle. Xanatos then set up a series of charges to ignite a chain reaction around Bandomeer, planning on killing Jinn. More importantly, he wanted to see Jinn die knowing that he could not save Bandomeer's citizens.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nLater, Xanatos forged a message to [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Kalpana (Supreme Chancellor)|Kalpana]] that looked like it came from Bandomeer's [[Governor/Legends|governor]], [[SonTag]], requesting Jinn to act as a diplomat for the peace meeting between Offworld and its rival company, the [[Arcona Mineral Harvest Corporation]]. He also sent a somewhat taunting message to Jinn that read: ''\"I have been looking forward to this day.\"'' Beside his name was a drawing of the broken circle.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" /><ref name=\"Rising Force\" />\n\nSince [[Jemba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] had recently died, Xanatos would have to take his place as Offworld's representative. Before attending the meeting in [[Bandor (city)|Bandor]], the capital of Bandomeer, he arranged for a bomb to placed in the Home Planet Mine, where its [[Sensor/Legends|sensor]] was sabotaged. Arriving late, he found Jinn with Arcona Mineral Harvest chief operations manager [[Clat'Ha]], Governor SonTag, and VeerTa; he adopted a cheery disposition to his former master and went on how he \"went astray\" from the Jedi teachings before going to Offworld.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nMoving on to business, Xanatos claimed that he desired peace between Offworld and Arcona Mineral Harvest. To further his ruse, he proposed sending ten percent of Offworld's profits for the [[Bandomeer reclamation effort]]. Then, the bomb went off in the Home Planet Mine. VeerTa, suspecting Offworld, lunged herself at Xanatos, but was stopped by Jinn. Xanatos, feigning surprise, denied all involvement. SonTag sent VeerTa off to help the [[Miner/Legends|miners]] out of the wreckage.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nWhen the rescue was completed, Xanatos sent SonTag an offer to rebuild the mine: not only would he send [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], [[Droid/Legends|droids]], and anything else Bandomeer would need, but also put recently unemployed miners to work at Offworld. Sure enough, Offworld was as good as its word&mdash;they even cleared the tunnels of debris before starting to repairing them&mdash;but only to sell the deception.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nLater, Xanatos traveled at the [[Eastern Enrichment Zone]] with five members of the [[Offworld Security Force]], intent on capturing the failed [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi Initiate]], Obi-Wan Kenobi. Entering alone, he traveled to the [[Enrichment Dome|Dome]] and found Kenobi inside the [[Dome wall secret annex|secret storage compartment]]. He ensured Kenobi that he was a \"friend\" and warned him that the boy would not make it as Jinn's apprentice, thanks to his cold nature. It was enough to fill Kenobi's mind with doubts.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nThen, as if signaled by Xanatos, the guards stormed in while pretending to identify their employer and Kenobi as thieves. Xanatos activated his lightsaber and made a feigned attack on the guards, with Kenobi on the defensive: neither were willing to kill the guards. After Kenobi dealt with three guards, a fourth raised an [[Electro-jabber|electrojabber]] against Xanatos, under the feigned intent to strike the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]]. Kenobi rushed to apprehend the guard, only to be shocked in the ribs. He was then knocked unconscious from behind, either by Xanatos or another guard. Xanatos then sent Kenobi off to the [[Deepsea mines|mines]] within the [[Great Sea of Bandomeer]], but not before taking the boy's [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's first lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]].<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nOnce that was out of the way, the Dark Jedi returned to Bandor to oversee operations at the northern [[azurite]] mining quadrant, which was the largest in the outskirts of the city. It was nightfall when he started leaving the administrative building. The shifts had been changed and all miners vacated the vicinity. Just as Xanatos passed the yard, Qui-Gon Jinn emerged from the shadows of surrounding slag piles and blocked his path.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nXanatos did not show any surprise; whether he was inwardly startled that Jinn had been waiting for him or he had just [[Force sense/Legends|felt]] his former mentor's presence and deliberately came to meet him, it was hard to say. After Jinn declared Xanatos' plans for Bandomeer put to an end, the latter revealed his lightsaber. He was angered when told that he had disgraced the weapon he carried, but smiled with mirth.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nThe two men circled each other, verbally clashing on who betrayed who and which one relished over the other's misery. As Jinn explained that Yoda foresaw that Xanatos would fail back on Telos, the Dark Jedi seethed in anger. To him, Yoda did not understand a tenth of true power: the power of the dark side. Xanatos reasoned that Jinn would've been rich by now, if he had not been made \"too good\" by the Jedi teachings. Jinn countered that Xanatos would never own Bandomeer.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nWhen the time for words had passed, Xanatos activated his lightsaber and attacked. Jinn measured up a sterling defense, managing to block and evade his former pupil's strikes. Knowing he could not wear Xanatos down, he went to the offensive, but Xanatos just laughed, countering Jinn's every move. The two combatants appeared to be evenly matched. Xanatos proclaimed that because of the suffering Jinn had caused him, he had surpassed him. But then, a mistake with his footwork caused Jinn to [[Shiim/Legends|wound his shoulder]]; the Jedi Master pointed out that he was only deluding himself.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nSuddenly, Xanatos drew out Kenobi's lightsaber with his other hand, causing Jinn to lose his focus momentarily. The Dark Jedi taunted him on the whereabouts of his \"new apprentice\" before lashing out with both weapons, hoping to intensify the duel. But Jinn remembered Xanatos' moves while training him in the Jedi Temple and evaded his attacks. He grabbed Kenobi's lightsaber from Xanatos and escaped the mine to search for the missing Padawan; this was the first time he had ever fled from a fight. Xanatos called out after him, claiming that the Jedi had only escaped for now.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nTwo days later, Xanatos learned of a deactivated [[Transmitter/Legends|transmitter]] in the Offworld [[Offworld Mining loading dock|loading dock]] on Bandor's [[Bandor harbor|harbor]]. He knew that Jinn was there. He mounted a [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] and traveled to meet his former Master, planning to chase him all the way to the Home Planet Mine. There, he would trap him and activate the ion bombs to enact his revenge.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nXanatos found Jinn and an escaped Kenobi on an Offworld [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]] entering Bandor's outskirts. He fired with his speeder bike's [[Laser cannon/Legends|laser cannon]], driving them to his trap. As they reached the Home Planet Mine, Jinn and Kenobi jumped from their speeder. Xanatos sped toward them and narrowly missed a fatal blow from Jinn, all the while causing the elder Jedi to hurt his own shoulder. Knowing that Xanatos was too fast while mounted on his speeder, the Jedi fled into the mine.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nXanatos followed his quarry down the mine levels. On the way, he overheard Jinn telling Kenobi in [[Core 6]] of what he had been told by VeerTa: Xanatos had no knowledge of the north [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]] leading to Core 5. The Jedi would be able to either catch the Dark Jedi by surprise or escape from the mine. But Xanatos caught up with the Jedi and blocked their path, proving Jinn's assumptions wrong, all the while rubbing all the elder Jedi's mistakes in his face. When he started referring Kenobi as \"clumsy,\" the boy leapt over Xanatos and wounded him in the lightsaber hand. A brief duel started between Xanatos and the Jedi before the former broke off and ran into Core 5, luring the latter into his trap.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nAs the Jedi entered Core 5, Xanatos set the ion bombs on a [[Ion clock|timer]], blocked the tunnel with a hidden panel, and shut off the lights. He used the dark area to his advantage, attacking and withdrawing at a very fast, vicious pace. But Jinn and Kenobi barely managed to defend themselves and each other from Xanatos' onslaughts. As the Jedi's [[Force bond]] grew stronger, they drove Xanatos into a corner.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nBut Xanatos knew that the wall was a coated transparisteel door to a hidden turbolift. He slipped inside and shut the door before Jedi struck the impervious transparisteel. He told the Jedi through an amplifier that they were going to die, lying about there being mixed gases to disguise the bombs. Then, the Dark Jedi ascended to the mine, wishing Jinn a painful death. He prepared to immediate takeoff from Bandomeer, believing Bandomeer and the Jedi to be now doomed.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nHowever, with the help of Kenobi, Jinn had enough time to deactivate the bombs, ending Xanatos' plans. When Xanatos had heard about this, he returned to Bandomeer. He infiltrated Governor SonTag's [[Bandomeer governor's quarters|quarters]], sneaked into Jinn's guest chamber, and stabbed a message through the Jedi's sleep-couch with a [[Vibro-shiv/Legends|vibro-shiv]]. In the message, he vowed never to underestimate Jinn again, while looking forward to their next meeting. Then he had likely returned to Telos,<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" /> where he planned to stripmine the planet to obtain wealth.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\n====Gala====\nFor some time, Xanatos had been involved in the changing political climate on [[Gala]]. When head of the [[Ministry of Councilers]] [[Lonnag Giba]] feared that [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Beju]] would lose the [[Galacian Gubernatorial election, 44 BBY|gubernatorial election]], he secretly asked Xanatos to lend Offworld financial support for [[Deca Brun]], who was another candidate, and many [[Galacian]] industries. In return, Brun had created a company called [[Galacian Mining Corporation]], a front for Offworld's activities, which would include the enslavement of his own people. Half of Gala would be under Xanatos' control.<ref name=\"Mark of the Crown\">''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Mark of the Crown]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the plans in Brun's records and exposed the conspiracy to [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Veda (Galacian)|Veda]], the ruler of Gala, resulting in Giba's arrest and the election of [[Wila Prammi]] as governor. At first, when he had been captured by Brun's men, Kenobi feared that Brun would contact Xanatos about the boy's and Qui-Gon Jinn's presence on Gala; Xanatos would use him as bait for his former master. Now that the elections had brought a peaceful transition to Gala, Jinn knew that he would place everyone on the planet in jeopardy, if and when Xanatos came after him there. He and Kenobi left as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"Mark of the Crown\" />\n\n====Attack on the Jedi Temple====\n{{Quote|It took longer than even I imagined for you to figure out it was me. That noble head of yours can be so thick. Foolishly, I continue to give you credit for some intelligence.|Xanatos, to Qui-Gon Jinn before they engaged each other in the Jedi Temple|Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning}}\n[[File:Bruck_Chun.jpg|thumb|[[Bruck Chun]], the [[Jedi Initiate/Legends|Jedi Initiate]] whom Xanatos turned to the dark side.]]\nElsewhere, things were looking bad for Offworld. A mining operation on an \"inhospitable world\" was proving futile, but Xanatos stubbornly kept pouring more money into it, putting the company into a financial crises. When he had learned that the Jedi Council was holding a ship full of [[Crystalline vertex/Legends|crystalline vertex]] for safekeeping in the Temple's [[Treasury room|Treasury Room]], he sensed an opportunity and personally traveled to Coruscant. He [[Incident at the Jedi Temple|infiltrated]] the Temple through its water tunnels, hiding his [[Airspeeder/Legends|airspeeder]] there for his means of escape. He had also brought along a [[waterproof satchel]] for his back. When he discovered Bruck Chun feeling his chances of becoming a Padawan destroyed, he manipulated the young Initiate into becoming his apprentice, teaching him the ways of the dark side.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" /> To make sure that Chun was firmly put under his control, he slipped a listening device planted into the [[Lightsaber hilt/Legends|hilt]] of his accomplice's lightsaber.<ref name=\"Deceptions\" /> The Dark Jedi planned to see the whole Temple be destroyed and walk away with all the vertex in his possession.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nTo carry out his plan, Xanatos instructed Chun to steal a number of items: a toolbox from the servo-utility unit for him to bypass security and sabotage the systems of the Temple; [[Holographic filing system|holographic files]] and [[Computer/Legends|computer]] records containing the names of students from A to H, which contained Chun's file; the meditation robe of a Jedi instructor, which Xanatos could blend in with the other Jedi [[Force stealth|undetected]]; a fourth-year student's sports activity kit full of [[Rebreather/Legends|rebreathers]] to use underwater; every single lightsaber from the senior training rooms, thus rendering all older Padawans defenseless for an attack; and the [[Healing Crystals of Fire]], which Xanatos would plant into the Temple's [[Fusion furnace/Legends|fusion furnace]] for its destruction. That had put all the classes and activities to a halt.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" /><ref name=\"Uncertain Path\">''[[Jedi Apprentice: The Uncertain Path]]''</ref> At the training facility, Xanatos had a threatening message intended for Yoda written on the wall: ''COME YOUR TIME WILL. BEWARE YOU MUST, TROUBLE I AM.''<ref name=\"Uncertain Path\" />\n\nXanatos prodded Chun to bring him updates on Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn. It was through this method that he had learned of Obi-Wan Kenobi's leaving the Order to support a [[The Young|rebellion]] on [[Melida/Daan]]. Chun had also told Xanatos of his rivalry with Kenobi, which, in one instance, led to a brawl in the Temple.<ref name=\"Deceptions\" /> At the same time as the thefts began, Xanatos discovered that Yoda was supplying a blinded Tahl with a [[2JTJ personal navigation droid|navigation droid]] [[2JTJ]]. He stealthy placed a transmitter inside TooJay to spy on Tahl and Qui-Gon Jinn, who were in charge of the investigation. He would always keep an eye on them.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nChun hid most of the stolen artifacts into a crate, which he hid in the [[Jedi Temple Lake Level]]. Unknown to him, Qui-Gon Jinn and a blinded Tahl had found the chest and were waiting in the darkened level to trail the thief. When Chun came back to retrieve the chest, Xanatos had already been aware of the trap and concealed his presence from the Jedi. He started following Jinn, who was trailing Chun; his intention may have been to assassinate his former Master from behind. However, while blind, Tahl could make out the intruder by his heavier boots and the brushing of the [[Icus leaf|icus leaves]]. Suddenly, TooJay accidentally alerted Chun, causing him and Xanatos to disappear.<ref name=\"Uncertain Path\" />\n\nLater, when Jinn left for Melida/Daan to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi,<ref name=\"Uncertain Path\" /> Xanatos made a false assassination attempt on Yoda to strike a blow into the Jedi's hearts. Disguised in the stolen meditation robe, he had placed a bomb under a footbridge in the [[Room of a Thousand Fountains/Legends|Room of a Thousand Fountains]], where Yoda would usually meditate. He gave off a surge of his dark side power, alerting Yoda to the bomb before it exploded. Satisfied, he ducked into a waterfall to escape and left a scaring message for the Council members in a [[Meditation chamber/Legends|meditation chamber]]: ''MEDITATE ON THIS, MASTERS: NEXT TIME I WILL NOT FAIL.''<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nBy the time Jinn and Kenobi returned, Xanatos had entered the [[Jedi Temple Technical Center|Tech Center]] via the water purification tanks and tampered with the cooling unit as well as the lighting and communication systems; the disruptions frustrated the efforts of his old rival Miro Daroon, who was now the Tech Center supervisor. Later, he slipped into the lake level and placed a [[time bomb]] into all but one of the [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift engines]] in the horizantal turbolift, which was carrying caretaker [[Ali-Alann]] and a [[Unidentified Jedi clan|bunch of younglings]]. In addition to this, he placed a bug on the Temple's central core to shut down every single [[Comm unit/Legends|comm unit]] and turbolift in the Temple. All of his were designed to divert the Jedi's attention away from him. Furthermore, with all the danger going on, wing after wing had been down, placing every Jedi in the central building; Xanatos' job of destroying them would be much easier.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\n[[File:Captive_Temple_cropped.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Xanatos [[Incident at the Jedi Temple|fought]] his arch-nemeses, Qui-Gon Jinn and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], in the [[Jedi Temple]].]]\nWhen Xanatos heard Jinn and Tahl had finally identified him as the intruder and that a [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] Padawan named [[Bant Eerin/Legends|Bant Eerin]] discovered how he accessed the Temple, he submerged in one of the purification tanks to await the Jedi, cloaking his presence for a surprise. As he sensed Jinn, Kenobi, and Eerin arrive on the platform above the tank, he emerged from the water. He began taunting Jinn on how slow he was to realize the Dark Jedi's involvement and his needing children for help. He jumped up after the Jedi, causing Eerin to dive and swim for help.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nXanatos engaged Kenobi and Jinn, hoping to lure them away from his airspeeder. He knew the Jedi were trying to back him toward the tank, so that either his lightsaber would short out or he would lessen his attacks. He could use the water to cover his escape. Moments later, a large wave rushed from a conduit in the tank. After the Jedi leaped out of the way, Xanatos, instead of following them as they expected, turned off his lightsaber and allowed the water to take him.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nSoon, the airspeeder had been found and was under guard by the [[Temple Security Force]]. But as night came, Xanatos and Chun kidnapped Bant Eerin.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" /> They brought her to the Room of a Thousand Fountains, where Xanatos personally chained her under the waterfall pool. He taunted her with the promise of her own imminent death, as Jinn and Kenobi would fail to save her in time.<ref name=\"Deceptions\" /> Then, the Dark Jedi contacted Jinn via his own [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]]. He demanded that the Jedi give back his airspeeder, have it fueled and placed in the [[Jedi Temple|spaceport]], and hand over the vertex in fifteen minutes. If they refused, Eerin would die. As Jinn asked Xanatos to confirm his claim to holding Eerin, the Dark Jedi allowed the Mon Calamari to speak before cutting transmission.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nMinutes later, through 2JTJ, Xanatos had heard Jinn and Kenobi argue on whether or not they should give him the vertex and the airspeeder. Then, Jinn had said that Miro Daroon would shut down power to the Temple for twelve minutes while searching for bugs. While watching them head for the north wing, Xanatos brought along Bruck to steal the vertex in the security chamber through the duct system. He knew that when Daroon started getting every last system, the Temple would be doomed.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nLittle did Xanatos know that the transmitter he slipped inside TooJay had been discovered by the Jedi. Furthermore, what appeared to be Kenobi and Jinn were actually Ali-Alann and Initiate [[Garen Muln]] dressed in the former pair's clothes. The conversation was forged in a [[voice]] track to make Xanatos think that Kenobi was impatient for battle, thus underestimating the boy. His own devices had been used against him. Now he and Chun were heading into a trap.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nAs the Dark Jedi exited the grate leading to the Treasury Room door, Jinn and Kenobi activated their lightsabers, taking them by surprise. Xanatos managed to react in time, but Chun was swiftly disarmed by Jinn. Now it was Xanatos' turn to surprise the Jedi. He took Chun hostage and threatened to kill him as well as Eerin. Kenobi feigned his part of impatience and indifference to Chun, causing Xanatos to speculate the Padawan learning this from Jinn. Then, both Jedi charged simultaneously. Xanatos pushed Chun to engage Kenobi, then ordered him to ensure Eerin's death. Chun obeyed and Kenobi went after him, leaving Jinn to face Xanatos alone.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nFormer master and student fought and taunted each other all the way up to the [[High Council Chamber]]. Xanatos cut a window open and exited on a ledge for the [[Hangar/Legends|hangers]] fifteen stories below. Jinn followed and caught up to him right above the landing platform. They battled atop the narrow ledge, each combatant careful not to fall. Feeling desperate, Xanatos revealed that he had rigged the fusion furnace to implode and gave a small hint to the Healing Crystals of Fire:\n{{Quote|What you revere can destroy you. Haven't you learned that yet?|Xanatos, tipping Jinn off|Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple}}\nJinn hesitated as the lights from the Council chambers began turning back on. Xanatos taunted him on the issue of Kenobi's decision to remain behind on Melida/Dawn, as if the Padawan wanted to get away from Jinn. Then, he spotted an [[Air taxi/Legends|air taxi]] twenty meters below and jumped to meet it, throwing the hapless driver to his death. He drove away, forcing Qui-Gon to go descend toward the tech center.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" />\n\nAs Xanatos escaped to Telos IV,<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" /> Jinn and Kenobi stopped Miro Daroon from reactivating the last system and managed to retrieve the crystals, saving the Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" /> Later, Xanatos learned of Bruck Chun's death. He would reveal this to Chun's father, Vox, making him believe that Kenobi struck the boy down in cold blood.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" /> He also told Vox everything about Bruck's struggles and all he knew about Kenobi, which would used for a trial on Coruscant in the near future.<ref name=\"Deceptions\" /> Then, the Dark Jedi set out to prepare whatever he had in store next for his nemesis.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\n====Downfall on Telos====\n{{Quote|The court may have listened to your lies. But when the Temple learns&mdash;\"<br />\"By the time the Temple learns of your fate, you will already be dead. That is your punishment, Jedi. You have been sentenced to death. And I will be there to watch you die.|Qui-Gon Jinn and Xanatos|Jedi Apprentice: The Day of Reckoning}}\n[[File:XanatosTelos.jpg|thumb|230px|Xanatos had preplanned his archenemies' demise when they [[Second Mission to Telos|arrived]] on Telos IV.]]\nJinn and Kenobi [[Second Mission to Telos|doggedly tracked]] Xanatos all the way to Telos, but the Dark Jedi had led them into a trap. He had used his influence to frame the Jedi for violating the [[Galactic Criminals Act]], offering large rewards for those who would turn them in.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nWhile making an appearance at the [[Katharsis dome (Thani)|Katharsis dome]] in Thani a day before the main event, Xanatos went outside for a walk. Then, sensing the presence of Jinn and Kenobi, he stopped. He knew that the Jedi were on the planet, possibly also felt them near his position. Grinning and chuckling in satisfaction, he went back inside the dome.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nLater that day, Jinn and Kenobi were captured while infiltrating UniFy. Xanatos denied them a chance to appear at their trial to clear their names, claiming that they were \"too dangerous to attend.\" Instead, he appeared as the \"star witness\" with false evidence of every single supposed crime the Jedi had committed in the galaxy. He also had Vox Chun to testify against Kenobi for the \"murder\" of his son, Bruck. As a result, the Jedi had been sentenced to be executed.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nIt was nighttime when Xanatos visited the Jedi in their cells at the [[Central Booking Station]], explaining the proceedings in the courtroom. When Kenobi deemed the trial unfair, the Dark Jedi outwardly reflected back to how \"fair\" his life had been meeting Jinn. He seethed in annoyance when Jinn countered with the usual Jedi \"riddles.\" Then, he played on Kenobi's guilty feelings for Bruck Chun's death, followed by clapping his hands to mimic the crack of the fallen Initiate's neck. Laughing at Jinn's belief that the Jedi Council would react decisively once they learned of the situation, Xanatos revealed to the Jedi their fate. He was reveling in his revenge, watching his archenemy&mdash;his former master&mdash;die. Before leaving, he ordered a troop of TSF guards to watch the prisoners.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nIn the morning, Xanatos stood at the top of the courtyard stairs amongst an angry crowd of Telosians. He watched with enthusiasm as Kenobi and Jinn were led into an [[energy cage]]. But when the [[executioner]]s arrived and the bars of the cage were deactivated, the Jedi activated their hidden lightsabers, deflecting blasterfire as they fled aboard two unidentified [[Swoop/Legends|swoop]] drivers that came to their rescue. Xanatos could only look hatefully at his escaped quarry. He would meet them again.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nXanatos later attended Katharsis and a man named [[Denetrus]] had won the wager. The Dark Jedi rose from the center ring and spoke to address the crowd on how Katharsis was helping Telos. Then, he noticed that the crowd was shouting in fits of outrage and looked at the [[Viewscreen/Legends|viewscreens]]. He saw images of Offworld's operations in the Sacred Pools, but did not panic. He had no doubt that his Jedi adversaries took the recordings.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nXanatos calmed the crowd as the crowd demanded an explanation. He assured them that this was a conspiracy; the Sacred Pools were in perfect form. As he asked the Governor if he would open the Sacred Pools for the public to see for themselves, the old man conceded. Winning over the people's trust, Xanatos stepped away for a moment. He ordered a TSF guard to display the faces of Jinn and Kenobi on the screens. As he returned to the crowd, the Dark Jedi proclaimed that these two men were the ones responsible for this deception. He asked if anyone had seen them. Then, someone in the crowd spotted the Jedi, exposing their position. The guards caught them before they could escape.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\n[[File:The_Day_of_Reckoning.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The death of Xanatos]]\nDen, appearing to be impatient and indifferent to the situation, asked for his reward, drawing everyone's attention. Xanatos brought the vertex and [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] over to the winner, wanting to get this ceremony done as quickly as possible. As Den turned toward the crowd, he asked the Governor to read aloud the durasheet he had given him before the final Katharsis round. The Governor complied, quoting ever last detail of Den's wager, which foretold what exactly happened in the ring. Den revealed to the crowd that he had rigged the Katharsis computer to win the lottery; in fact, every last contest had been fixed. He went on, shouting on how everyone on Telos had been played by UniFy, Offworld, and the \"mighty Xanatos.\" As a result, the crowd was in an uproar, calling for Xanatos' arrest.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nHowever, Xanatos had motioned the crowd to hush again. Instead of offering any more defense, as everyone expected, he simply smiled and scolded them for being \"pathetic fools.\" He fled aboard the [[Kama Elias|winning contestant's]] swoop, which was the fastest of all three at the round, all the while dogging the Jedi as he headed for the Sacred Pools. Unfortunately, the swoop ran out of fuel and he was forced to use a [[Hoversled/Legends|gravsled]]. He neared [[Tech Dome D]], where transport could take him off Telos. Jinn cut off his escape route, thus causing the frustrated Dark Jedi to veer toward a landscape filled with pools of [[Color/Legends|black]] acid. Xanatos leaped from his gravsled and forced Jinn into a final showdown.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nAs they fought, Jinn assured his former apprentice that he only wanted to bring him to justice, not kill him. But Xanatos' hatred for the hard man he had believed Jinn to be blinded him to reason. Moments later, Kenobi arrived to join Jinn in the duel. Xanatos taunted Kenobi on how he felt when he \"killed\" Bruck Chun, catching the Padawan off-guard long enough to kick him to the ground. He leaped in to finish Kenobi, but Jinn rushed to the rescue, catching the Dark Jedi in a midair blade-lock. Both combatants landed on their feet and Xanatos resumed his taunting of Kenobi. Jinn countered that it was Xanatos, not Kenobi, who was responsible for Chun's death by turning him to the dark side. Then, after silent encouragement from Jinn, Kenobi attacked Xanatos with renewed conviction.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" />\n\nTogether, the Jedi drove Xanatos toward the edge of one of the acid pools. Two swoops bearing [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Andra_(Telos_IV) Andra], head of the illegal POWER party, and Den pulled up behind the Dark Jedi. Andra demanded that Xanatos surrender; he would face trial in Thani for his crimes. Surrounded, Xanatos defiantly told Jinn that he was his biggest failure.\n\nJinn tried to stop him from committing [[Suicide/Legends|suicide]], but it was too late. Xanatos smiled as he leaped backward into the acid, hoping that his death would haunt his former master forever. His body dissolved in seconds, followed by his black cloak.<ref name=\"Day of Reckoning\" /> He was twenty-five years old.\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|You will never have the satisfaction of killing me, Qui-Gon Jinn.

Looking to avenge his father's death, Omega followed the same formula that Xanatos did,<ref name=\"Shadow Trap\" /><ref name=\"False Peace\" /> although he believed that Jinn killed his father and refused to believe what Kenobi was trying to say. He would then walk in Xanatos' footsteps by trying to convert Kenobi's Padawan, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]] to the free life.<ref name=\"Shadow Trap\" />\n\nKenobi had a vision of Xanatos' death while on the Sith planet of [[Zigoola]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]].<ref name=\"WildSpace\">''[[The Clone Wars: Wild Space]]''</ref>\n\nXanatos would be remembered even by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], [[Palpatine/Legends|Darth Sidious]]. He was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senator [[Sano Sauro]] sometime after his fall. He taught the Senator everything he knew about [[Midi-chlorian/Legends|midi-chlorians]]. This compelled Senator Sauro to eventually come up with a plan to use [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] children to train pilots for the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] so within a decade, the Empire would have an invincible fleet. Anakin Skywalker, now as Sidious's [[Sith apprentice/Legends|Sith apprentice]], Darth Vader, thought it was an absurd plan.<ref name=\"Tangled Web\">''[[The Last of the Jedi: A Tangled Web]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I always have a back door.|Xanatos|Jedi Apprentice: The Captive Temple}}\nWhat made Xanatos special, even as a young Padawan, was the quickness of his mind and strategical prowess. He always had a dual reason for every action and always seemed to be one step ahead of his adversaries. He was manipulative, deceiving when he wanted to be, and of course, like all Dark Jedi, pursued his own interests. He could also be overconfident. Qui-Gon Jinn saw all of this and chose to ignore it out of affection for him, like a father who chooses not to see his son's faults.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nBecause he loved his father Crion so much, Xanatos used the late Telosian governor's name as a password for the [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] stored in his [[Xanatos's private office|office]] on Bandomeer.<ref name=\"Dark Rival\" />\n\nXanatos became insane after turning to the dark side.<ref name=\"Captive Temple\" /> He may have been greedy for money, but he wanted something more: revenge.
