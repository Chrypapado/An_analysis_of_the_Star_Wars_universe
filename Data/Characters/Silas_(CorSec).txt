They got inside, but the Imperials pinned Silas and his men down, with [[Davit]] near death and [[Hanley]] and [[Crissom]] not much better. Silas tried to contact reinforcements at Checkpoint Lambda, but those were overrun as well, and a Republic hero answered the call instead. Responding to Silas' plea for help, the hero stormed the CorSec Academy building and rescued him and the rest of his squad before they were overrun by the Empire.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
