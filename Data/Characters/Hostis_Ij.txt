I'm sure the Empire would be glad to have you, Hostis.|Auxi Kray Korbin, to Hostis Ij, after the latter opposed the Military Disarmament Act|Aftermath (novel)}}\n'''Hostis Ij''' was a [[Chandrilan]] [[Gender|male]] [[human]] who served as an [[Advisor|adviser]] to [[New Republic]] [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] during the waning [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. When Mothma proposed her [[Military Disarmament Act]] on the [[planet]] [[Naalol]], the site of a [[blood]]y [[Battle of Naalol|battle]], Ij vehemently protested the change. Later, on [[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]]&mdash;the day of a planned treaty between the [[Galactic Empire]] and the New Republic&mdash;he was shot and rumored to have been [[Death|killed]] when a group of freed [[prison]]ers from [[Ashmead's Lock]] mysteriously and involuntarily shot key New Republic leaders. Following his death during the [[Attack on Chandrila]], his fellow adviser [[Auxi Kray Korbin]] recommended that Chancellor Mothma appoint a successor. Hostis was ultimately succeeded by the former [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]].\n\n==Biography==\n===The State of the Empire===\n{{Quote|Commander, I know you believe the Senate can still protect the people of the galaxy from the Emperor and his henchmen.  But as your adviser, it is my duty to tell you that I no longer believe this.|Hostis Ij to Mon Mothma|Star Wars: Rogue One: Rebel Dossier}}\nIn [[0 BBY]], shortly before [[Operation Fracture]], Ij wrote a memo to [[Mon Mothma]] detailing [[Gender|his]] thoughts on the state of the [[Galactic Empire]]. This memo described a system run by regional [[governor]]s and military oppression, with very little power existing with the [[Imperial Senate]]. Ij warned that the Senate could no longer be counted on to protect citizens of the Empire from the harsh treatment of [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and his war machine. Ij indicated that if there are any outspoken senators left in the Senate, they will face the same choice Mothma did: flee or be [[Death|executed]].<ref name=\"Rebel Dossier\" />\n\n===Military Disarmament Act===\n{{Quote|This is the price of war. It is not the Republic's fault, Chancellor.|Hostis Ij, to Mon Mothma, after the Battle of Naalol|Aftermath (novel)}}\nAfter the pivotal [[Battle of Endor]] and the death of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] Palpatine during the [[Galactic Civil War]], [[Battle of Naalol|a battle]] erupted on the [[planet]] [[Naalol]]. [[New Republic]] [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] Mon Mothma and [[Gender|her]] [[Advisor|advisers]], Hostis Ij and [[Auxi Kray Korbin]], visited a war-torn [[City|village]] on Naalol to provide aid to the wounded and to assess the aftermath of the fighting. In reaction to the seemingly excessive [[blood]]shed of the battle, the Chancellor proposed that the [[Emergency Powers Act/Legends|emergency powers]] that her office had retained since the [[Standard day|days]] of [[Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine be laid down and the power given back to the [[New Republic Senate|senate]]. She also announced the [[Military Disarmament Act]], which planned to reduce the [[New Republic army]] by 90 percent.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\nIj opposed both ideas, warning Mothma that a standing [[army]] and a strong leader were the only ways to avoid war with the remnants of the Galactic Empire. Kray Korbin disagreed with him, even going so far as to suggest he join the Empire, which offended Ij.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n===Secret meeting===\n{{Quote|If we step up recruitment, we will have more soldiers to secure supply lines once possessed by the Empire&mdash;such resources are out there in the wind, and who knows who will possess them.|Hostis Ij, suggesting future strategies for the New Republic's military|Aftermath: Life Debt}}\nAbout two [[Standard month|months]] later, Chancellor Mon Mothma called a meeting during which she iterated that the New Republic would give aid to those worlds with the greatest chances of joining the senate. Hostis Ij pointed out that the New Republic's resources were stretched thin, and suggested that the [[New Republic Defense Force]] step up recruitment and bolster its numbers to aid in the capture and occupation of former Imperial supply lines.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n===Liberation Day===\nShortly thereafter, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]]&mdash;de facto leader of the Empire&mdash;offered to make peace with the New Republic. Unbeknownst to the Republic's leaders, the peace talks were a ploy orchestrated by [[Gallius Rax]], an Imperial [[Fleet Admiral]]. The peace talks were scheduled for a day dubbed \"[[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]]\" by the senate. Sloane traveled to [[Chandrila]], having been informed that the New Republic [[capital]] would be the target of an Imperial attack, planned by Rax. The \"attack\" came not in the form of a bombardment, but rather as a series of assassination attempts as newly-freed [[prison]]ers from [[Ashmead's Lock]] on [[Kashyyyk]], who were under the influence of controller chips, mysteriously and involuntarily [[Attack on Chandrila|attacked]] New Republic leaders, injuring Mon Mothma and [[Kyrsta Agate]]. Hostis Ij, shot in the head during the attack, was rumored to be among the [[Death|dead]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|And I also advise you to find a second adviser. Hostis... Hostis is gone, and we need someone like him. We need his voice.|Auxi counselling Chancellor Mothma to find a successor to Hostis|Aftermath: Empire's End}}\nSeveral months after Hostis' death, Auxi counselled Chancellor Mothma to find a second adviser. While Hostis and Auxi disagreed professionally, the two were friends who drank, ate, and socialized together. Auxi was deeply affected by Hostis' death. Chancellor Mothma found a worthy successor in the form of the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], who managed to convince five senators to vote in favor of Mothma's bill to send New Republic military forces to [[Jakku]].<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:New_Republic_canon.svg|thumb|right|200px|Hostis Ij was a loyal member of the New Republic.]]\n{{Quote|You cannot be serious.|Hostis Ij, in response to Mon Mothma's announcement of the Military Disarmament Act|Aftermath (novel)}}\nHostis Ij and Auxi Kray Korbin often advised Chancellor Mon Mothma differently, each acting like an [[angel]] or [[demon]] on her shoulder. Sometimes, such as in the debate over the Military Disarmament Act, it was Ij who opposed the Chancellor, while at other times, the roles were reversed. Despite not always agreeing with Mothma, he was loyal to the New Republic and was offended when Kray Korbin sarcastically suggested the Empire would be glad to take him.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" /> Even though Kray Korbin and Ij often disagreed in their professional relationship, they were good friends, sharing drinks and spending time with each other's families.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHostis Ij first appeared in one of the many short-story interludes in author [[Chuck Wendig]]'s [[2015]] novel, [[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']].<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']] {{1st|[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Aftermath (audiobook)|''Aftermath'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''\n*[[Aftermath: Life Debt (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Life Debt'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Aftermath: Empire's End (audiobook)|''Aftermath: Empire's End'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: Rebel Dossier]]''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Hostis Ij#kanon\n|es=Hostis Ij\n|fr=Hostis Ij\n|ja=\u30db\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30fb\u30a4\u30fc\n|pl=Hostis Ij\n|ru=\u0425\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441 \u0418\u0436\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ij, Hostis}}\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Chandrilans]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic bureaucrats]]"}}}]}}}}
