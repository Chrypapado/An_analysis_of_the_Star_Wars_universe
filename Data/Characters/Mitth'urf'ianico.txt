Despite sharing a [[Chiss family|family]] with [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]] \"Thrawn\", Thurfian grew to be one of Thrawn's greatest enemies within the [[Chiss Ascendancy]], as he was vehemently opposed to Thrawn's obliviousness to politics.\n\n==Biography==\n===Aristocra of the Mitth===\nYears before the [[Nikardun conquests]], Thurfian, then an Aristocra, was tasked with recruiting cadet [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Kivu'raw'nuru]] of [[Rentor]] to [[rematching|join]] the Mitth family as a [[merit adoptive]]. Kivu'raw'nuru, then known by the core name Vurawn, was from an [[Kivu family|obscure family]] of low prestige. In spite of Vurawn's humble origins, he had grades, aptitude, and logic matrix that were \"off the boards,\" making him a prime candidate to become a cadet at the [[Taharim Academy]] on [[Naporar]]. Unbeknownst to Thurfian, Mitth family [[Patriarch]] [[Mitth'oor'akiord|Thooraki]] had insisted on recruiting Vurawn to the Mitth. Vurawn would later become [[Senior Captain]] Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the [[Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet]], better known as Thrawn.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nAt the time of the [[Vagaari pirate operations]], Thurfian was working as an overseer of a transportation and commerce office. At that time, Thrawn conducted a militarily successful but political mixed result with the acquisition of a [[gravity well projector]] from [[the galaxy|Lesser Space]] but the loss of the life of Syndic [[Mitth'ras'safis]] and a [[Unidentified Lesser Space starship|starship]] containing untold valuable Lesser Space technology.<ref name=\"Greater Good\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''</ref>\n\n===A Syndic opposing Thrawn===\n{{Quote|I believe the Nikardun have moved into the Lioaoin Regime.

Such events included the [[Lioaoin pirate campaign]] and the Vagaari pirate operations, which were military successes with heavy political fallout. Despite Thrawn's service in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, and despite the Fleet's mission to evaluate threats to the Ascendancy beyond their borders, Syndic Thurfian ardently opposed any action on Thrawn's part for fear of political fallout on the Ascendancy and on Mitth. Thurfian regularly viewed Thrawn as violating the Ascendancy's [[Preemptive-strike laws|non-aggression protocols]], even when others viewed Thrawn's actions as permitted.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nDespite the honor Thrawn would come to bring the Mitth family, Thurfian became an ardent enemy of Thrawn's. Thurfian considered Thrawn as likely to bring great ruin on the Mitth family as honor and glory. In 18 BBY,<ref name=\"Greater Good date\">{{GreaterGoodDate}}</ref> he conspired with Syndic [[Irizi'stal'mustro|Zistalmu]] of the rival [[Irizi family]] in order to manipulate Thrawn's career and embarrass him, but the pair failed to stop Thrawn's rise.<ref name=\"Greater Good\" />\n\n===Mitth family Syndic Prime===\n{{Quote|The problem is that every disaster he breaks over his knee is followed so quickly by a glowing success that everyone forgets or ignores what came before.|Syndic Prime Thurfian to Syndic Zistalmu, regarding Senior Captain Thrawn|Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good}}\nBetween the [[Battle over Primea]] and the conclusion of the [[Nikardun campaigns]], Mitth'urf'ianico was secretly promoted to the rank of [[Syndic Prime]].
