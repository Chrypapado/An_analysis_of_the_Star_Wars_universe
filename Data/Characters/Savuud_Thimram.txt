A [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], Thimram was personally trained by the [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] on the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Byss/Legends|Byss]] and became one of Palpatine's most faithful servants. He boasted particular skill in use of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], wielding numerous [[Force power/Legends|Force powers]] to his advantage. Thimram was present on Byss when the [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] was captured and brought before the Emperor in [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]].\n\n==Biography==\nSavuud Thimram, a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]], was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] to a [[Thimram family|wealthy family]] on [[Chandrila/Legends|Chandrila]], but when [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] sensed his [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitivity]], he was spirited away from his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] and taken to the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Byss/Legends|Byss]]. There, he was trained by the Emperor himself, who warped young Thimram's mind, turning him into a faithful and fully loyal servant to him and his new [[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]. In his position as a [[Dark Side Adept]], Thimram held less power than members of the Imperial [[Inquisitorius/Legends|Inquisitorius]], but still exerted considerable influence. While on Byss, Thimram was equipped with a [[Force pike/Legends|Force pike]] and a [[Dark side artifact|dark side talisman]]. At some stage, he took on an [[Unidentified Alderaanian noblewoman|apprentice]]&mdash;a young woman from [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] who had been lured to Byss by promises of wealth and luxury.<ref name=\"byss\" />\n\nIn [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]],<ref name=\"Comics Companion\">''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]''</ref> Thimram was stationed at the [[Emperor's Citadel]] on Byss with another Dark Side Adept, [[Gwellib Ap-Llewff]]. A [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] and member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], had been captured by the Empire, and was to be brought before Emperor Palpatine, who by this time was inhabiting a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] body. A [[Universal Energy Cage]] brought the captive to the Citadel, where he was received by Thimram, Ap-Llewff, and several other Dark Side Adepts. Upon exiting the cage he had been held in, Skywalker attacked several of the Adepts with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], claiming that he would enter the Citadel of his own volition. Thimram was amused, and he ordered Ap-Llewff not to hurt Skywalker, but to keep him covered on his short journey to Palpatine's location.<ref name=\"de\" /> Later that year, Palpatine was [[Battle of Onderon (Galactic Civil War)|definitively killed]], and Byss was obliterated by the [[Galaxy Gun]] superweapon.<ref name=\"ee\">''[[Star Wars: Empire's End]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nThimram made sure that the Emperor's orders were executed with swiftness and efficiency. As a result, he became one of the most feared and powerful individuals within the Galactic Empire.<ref name=\"byss\" /> Thimram was amused by the way in which Skywalker conducted himself while on Byss, and was highly derisive of the Jedi's ability to act in accordance to his own free will.<ref name=\"de\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIn order to obtain whatever he wanted, Thimram would utilize the power of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] to great effect. He had the ability to perform [[Mind trick/Legends|mind tricks]], [[Tutaminis|Drain Energy]], [[Telekinesis/Legends|Telekinesis]], [[Force stealth|Force Concealment]], and he could also [[Farsight/Legends|see into the future]]. In addition, Thimram was able to cast [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] and was [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathic]].<ref name=\"byss\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Savuud Thimram first appeared in [[Dark Empire 2|issue 2]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Dark Empire]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series, written by [[Tom Veitch]].
