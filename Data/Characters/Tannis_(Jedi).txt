Ascending to the rank of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]], Tannis was appointed as [[Headmaster/Legends|Headmistress]] of the [[Teyan Praxeum]], a [[Jedi academy]] on the planet [[Teya IV]]. A proponent of initiating all Forceful [[Sentience/Legends|sentients]] within the Order, Tannis served as a [[Jedi recruiter|recruiter]] and often traveled the galaxy to find new students to train with her on Teya IV. During her travels to [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]] in [[4000 BBY/Legends|4000 BBY]], Tannis discovered a family with two Forceful children living near [[Lir Lake]]. Testing both [[Vici Ramunee|Vici]] and [[Veni Ramunee]], she deemed them eligible for Jedi training and took them to the Teyan Academy to learn the ways of the Jedi.<ref name=\"TMDF\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nTannis's appearance at first seemed a continuity error, since the Omwati were not supposed to be discovered until [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin's]] lifetime. ''[[Alien Anthology]]'' retconned this by explaining that a mysterious Omwati colony was established on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] long before Tarkin discovered [[Omwat/Legends|Omwat]]. How the colony came to be there is uncertain, but it may indicate the Omwati had contact with the galactic community prior to the [[Old Sith Wars]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|11|The Most Dangerous Foe}} {{1st}} {{Flash}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Alien Anthology]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Jedi Masters of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Jedi seekers]]\n[[Category:Omwati]]"}}}]}}}}
