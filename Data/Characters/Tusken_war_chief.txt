The remains of a derelict [[Sandcrawler/Legends|sandcrawler]] served as their home, where he held the [[Monarch of Naboo/Legends|Queen of Naboo]] hostage as a trophy.\n\n==Biography==\nUpon landing on the [[Desert/Legends|desert]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], the Queen's [[handmaiden]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] set out for Mos Espa, a nearby [[City/Legends|city]], with the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]], [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]], and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]]. While they were absent, [[Sab\u00e9/Legends|Sab\u00e9]] (in the guise of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] Amidala) received a message from [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Sio Bibble/Legends|Sio Bibble]], pleading her to contact him on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]]. [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] of Jinn, cautioned against this, a warning she heeded.<ref name=\"tpm\">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> At any rate, she could not act without the Queen's authority, but still found the situation she was in to be highly taxing.<ref name=\"ff\">''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]''</ref>\n\nWhile biding their [[Time/Legends|time]], Sab\u00e9 was captured by Tusken Raiders and taken to the war chief.<ref name=\"SW:OW\" /> Kenobi tracked them through their extensive canyon dwellings among old scavenged wrecks, and was forced to journey through a communal Tusken burial site in search of her. He located the decoy Queen being held in a derelict craft that they used for shelter and was led into a confrontation with the war chief, whom he subsequently [[Death/Legends|defeated]]. In an odd move for the Sand People, the remainder among them solemnly and ceremoniously conceded defeat after Kenobi demanded to be allowed to return to safety with Sab\u00e9. Having slain the Tusken war chief and successfully rescued Sab\u00e9, the duo returned to the [[Starship/Legends|ship]] and awaited their companions return.<ref name=\"SW:OW\" />\n\n[[19 BBY/Legends|Years later]], while in hiding on Tatooine, Kenobi would recount of this incident in a [[Meditation/Legends|meditative]] conversation with the [[Force spirit]] of his former [[Jedi Master/Legends|Master]], Qui-Gon Jinn.<ref name=\"Kenobi\">[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']]</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Tusken war chief was a boss in the game ''[[Star Wars: Obi-Wan]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Obi-Wan]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[Kenobi (novel)|''Kenobi'']] {{Imo}}\n*[[Kenobi (audiobook)|''Kenobi'' audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{InsiderCite|57|Gamescape}} {{1stm}}\n*{{GamerCite|8|State of the Arts}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]\n[[Category:Tusken Raiders]]"}}}]}}}}
