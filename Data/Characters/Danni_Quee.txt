She was present at the very first [[Yuuzhan Vong]] incursions into [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], experiencing the horrors of war and the ferocity of the invaders at [[Helska IV]], a [[Planet/Legends|planet]] she was taken to after being captured. Though the Yuuzhan Vong intended to sacrifice her to [[Yun'o|their gods]], Quee was [[Battle of Helska IV|rescued]] by [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], though another [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoner]], the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Miko Reglia]], [[Death/Legends|perished]] in a futile escape attempt.\n\nQuee, though originally an [[astrophysicist]], soon became an expert on the Yuuzhan Vong's [[biot]]s and biotechnology, searching for ways to counter their weaponry. She was constantly near the front lines on the war, seeking to decipher the [[Alien/Legends|alien]] organisms while honing her latent [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Force-sensitive/Legends|abilities]]. Her efforts led to the development of [[yammosk]] war coordinator detection and jamming equipment, a valuable contribution to the war effort. The weaponry first saw use in the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]] and later in numerous battles throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War. Quee was present at the [[Battle of Borleias (Yuuzhan Vong War; Second)|Battle of Borleias]] and journeyed to occupied [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to investigate the effects of its [[Terraforming/Legends|Vongforming]].\n\nLater, Quee accompanied [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and Jacen [[House of Solo|Solo]] to the living planet [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]], and she was fascinated by that world. When Zonama Sekot returned to known [[Realspace/Legends|space]] to help in the [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|final battle of the Yuuzhan Vong War]], Quee accompanied it. At the war's end, Quee remained on Zonama Sekot, resigning from the [[New Jedi Order]] during the [[Dark Nest Crisis]], as she felt her place was on the living planet.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]]<ref name=\"vp\" /> Danni Quee, a native of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Commenor/Legends|Commenor]],<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" /> was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]<ref name=\"Birth date\" /> as the daughter of an [[astrophysicist]] [[Parent/Legends|mother]] and a [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucrat]] father.

Quee was enjoying the world and her work there, and the fifteen other members of the station looked up to her as their nominal leader. She had already shown initiative, [[Death/Legends|killing]] a [[redcrested cougar]] and [[Technician/Legends|repairing]] a damaged [[orbiting telescope]].<ref name=\"vp\" /> She was the leader of the station, keeping it running well through measures such as forbidding excessive [[Ryll/Legends|ryll]] [[Spice/Legends|spice]] use, though she did allow the other crewmembers some small vices.<ref name=\"Staring at the Stars\">{{WizardsCite|url=starwars/article.asp?x=sw20020124b_njo|text=Staring at the Stars|int=Staring at the Stars|archivedate=20100227200942}}</ref> However, Quee was unaware that one of her crewmembers was [[Yomin Carr]], an advance [[Scout/Legends|scout]] for the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], an [[Yuuzhan Vong galaxy|extra-galactic]] [[Species/Legends|species]], who were preparing to launch an invasion of Quee's [[Galaxy/Legends|galaxy]].<ref name=\"vp\" />\n\n[[File:Danni_FF.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Quee works in the field.]]\nQuee was delighted when the equipment scanning the edges of the galaxy discovered that what appeared to be an [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] had breached the galactic edges. Tracking the \"asteroid,\" Quee and her crew determined that it was on a collision course with the planet [[Helska IV]]. Despite their communications to ExGal headquarters going offline, Quee did not realize that it was an invasion or suspect a threat from the anomaly. After reclassifying the \"asteroid\" as a \"[[Comet/Legends|comet]]\" because they had discovered a tail on it, Quee rounded up two members of her team, [[Bensin Tomri]] and [[Cho Badeleg]]. The three then took the station's [[Spacecaster-class shuttle|Spacecaster]] to further investigate why the \"comet\"'s collision had not caused Helska IV to explode.<ref name=\"vp\" />\n\nWhile traveling to Helska IV, the three discovered that the \"comet\" was actually a [[Koros-Strohna|worldship]] of the [[Praetorite Vong]], and their attempts to contact ExGal-4 or escape the system were in vain. The Spacecaster was captured and Tomri and Badeleg were killed by the invaders, while Quee's life was spared at the request of Carr. Considered worthy enough to be a sacrifice to their [[Yun'o|gods]], Quee was held captive on Helska IV in preparation for that ceremony.<ref name=\"vp\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Carr destroyed the outpost on Belkadan, leaving no survivors. On Helska IV, Quee was soon joined by another captive, the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Miko Reglia]], who had responded to her [[Distress signal/Legends|distress call]], and she witnessed his [[Torture/Legends|torture]] as the [[yammosk]] war coordinator tried to break his will after the Jedi and the [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] had tried to escape.<ref name=\"vp\" />\n\nHowever, help was on the way, as the [[Solo twins]]&mdash;[[Darth Caedus|Jacen]] and [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]]&mdash;arrived in-[[Helska system|system]] in an [[iceborer]] craft with a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] following them not long afterward. After sensing her in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] and receiving her mental distress call, Jacen Solo arrived on Helska IV to rescue both Quee and Miko while Jaina remained in [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]]. Quee watched in horror as Miko sacrificed himself along with two Yuuzhan Vong [[Warrior caste|warriors]] in an attempt to cover their escape. The two blasted off the planet in Jacen's stylus ship, which he had used to get into the icy world, and met up with Jaina in the main iceborer, who docked with their ship and launched them into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], flanked by the [[Starship/Legends|starships]] [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] and ''[[Jade Sabre]]''. In the close quarters of the stylus ship, Quee's grief for Reglia and her co-workers on Belkadan overcame her resolve and hardened exterior, and Jacen comforted her as she wept, both ignoring their bedraggled appearances, injuries, and scanty Yuuzhan Vong garb. Later, she provided the information she had gleaned from her captivity to [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke]] and [[Mara Jade Skywalker]] and the Solos, leading to the successful resolution of the [[Battle of Helska IV]]. Quee rode out the battle in the ''Jade Sabre'', helping with the [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]] of the ship as best as she could.<ref name=\"vp\" />\n\n===The Yuuzhan Vong invasion===\n{{Quote|They had me once, and I don't want to be their prisoner again.

After the Senate dismissed Organa Solo's claims as a power grab on her part, Quee returned to Commenor to spend some [[Time/Legends|time]] with her [[Quee family|family]] and recover from her ordeal on Helska IV.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nQuee then spent some time developing her latent Force talents under the instruction of Jaina Solo, and accompanied both Jaina and Leia to a conference on the planet [[Agamar/Legends|Agamar]] in order to persuade the [[Agamarian]]s to house refugees from the planets the Yuuzhan Vong had conquered. Due to Leia's status as a hero and Quee's report on the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong, the Agamarians agreed to house the refugees.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nAfter the conference, Jaina and Quee accompanied Leia to the planet [[Dubrillion/Legends|Dubrillion]], where Quee fully experienced the pain and despair of the people, who had been [[Battle of Dubrillion|attacked]] by the Yuuzhan Vong. Jaina helped her develop control over some of what she [[Force sense/Legends|sensed]] in the Force, and Quee helped Jaina with her struggle to develop her own identity. As Leia and the entrepreneur [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] prepared to evacuate Dubrillion, Quee was ferried out on the [[Bothan Assault Cruiser]] ''[[Ralroost]]'' to the planet [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]], where Jacen, Luke, Mara, and [[Anakin Solo]], the youngest Solo child, were waiting, along with many refugees. However, Quee's tutelage under Jaina was cut short when Jaina transferred into [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]]. Instead, Quee spent some time with Jacen Solo, and though she felt some feelings for him, especially after his rescuing her from the Yuuzhan Vong, she told him that she thought he was better for her as a friend.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nQuee later utilized her fledgling Force skills to help Leia ferret out [[Cloaker|disguised]] Yuuzhan Vong infiltrators in the Dantooine refugee camp via use of the Force, at the same time as the raging [[Battle of Dantooine (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Dantooine]]. While doing so, she helped defend Calrissian from an attack by the Yuuzhan Vong [[Spy/Legends|spies]]. One of the Yuuzhan Vong attempted to use a child as a hostage, holding a purloined [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] to the child's head, but Quee used [[Telekinesis/Legends|telekinesis]] to slip the [[power pack]] out of the blaster and Leia killed the Vong warrior.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nLeia and Quee then journeyed to the planet [[Bastion/Legends|Bastion]] to meet with [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]] regarding [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] support against the Yuuzhan Vong. Quee was nervous about the meeting, but Pellaeon agreed to look over the material Leia sent him. As a result, he pledged limited aid to the New Republic, most of which took place at the [[Battle of Ithor]].<ref name=\"dt:r\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]''</ref>\n\n===Aiding the war effort===\n{{Quote|We must train you to fly an A-wing, Danni Quee. The Wild Knightz could use someone as crazy as you.|Saba Sebatyne, to Danni Quee|The New Jedi Order: Star by Star}}\nQuee eventually relocated with the other Jedi to the planet [[Eclipse (planet)|Eclipse]], a Jedi safe haven created after the public began turning on them. While there, she began working with the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] [[Cilghal]] on a way to track and identify the yammosk war coordinators in the hope of also finding means to counter them. Just before the Yuuzhan Vong attack on Coruscant, Quee was stationed with Jedi Master [[Saba Sebatyne]] and her [[Wild Knights]] squadron and assisted them in their skirmishes against the Yuuzhan Vong. During a [[Assault on Arkania|battle]] over the world of [[Arkania/Legends|Arkania]], Quee determined the [[Gravity/Legends|gravitic]] frequencies that the yammosks used to communicate, and she also helped the Wild Knights shoot down [[Yorik-et|coralskippers]] and avoid enemy fire as they flew through the enemy fleet, gathering valuable [[Sensor/Legends|sensor]] data on the way. A significant aid to her work came at the [[Operation Safe Passage|Battle of Talfaglio]] when they were able to capture an intact, albeit frozen, yammosk.<ref name=\"Star by Star\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Star by Star]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, Quee was angry upon learning of the [[Mission to Myrkr]], both at the foolhardy nature of the mission and that she had not been asked to go along by Luke Skywalker. In response, Quee buried herself in her gravitic research, and she and Cilghal took the starship ''[[Jade Shadow]]'' on a trip to the planet [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]] to ferry equipment there. The pair returned to Eclipse just as the [[Battle of Eclipse]] started when the Yuuzhan Vong chased the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Errant Venture]]'' through the system. By this time, Quee had developed methods for detecting the yammosks, though not how to disrupt their gravitic communications. Quee flew on the Wild Knights' [[blastboat]] again but was disappointed when they failed to capture a live yammosk, which she felt was vital to any future breakthroughs they would have on countering the yammosks. Thankfully though, Luke Skywalker was later able to retrieve one for her and her team at the [[Battle of the Black Bantha]], ferrying it back to Eclipse for research and examination.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\n[[File:Danni_Jedi_Storm.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Danni Quee, around the time of the Battle of Coruscant]]\nQuee was again thrust into action with the Wild Knights at the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]], flying once more with the Wild Knights in the massive engagement. In the midst of the battle, Quee helped coordinate attacks on the Yuuzhan Vong yammosks and a transmission from Cilghal completed the puzzle of the gravitic communications. As the capital burned, Quee activated her yammosk jamming for the first time, effecting the escape of the ''Millennium Falcon'' from Coruscant in the process, and finally providing a countermeasure for the Yuuzhan Vong's coordinators. The jamming, which disrupted the communications paths from the yammosks to the ships they controlled, threw the Yuuzhan Vong forces into disarray when used, depriving them of the eerie synchronization they had used to great effect throughout the war. Skywalker congratulated her on her achievement, saying that although her success had come too late for Coruscant it gave him hope for the future.<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nWhen Coruscant fell, Danni Quee accompanied the Wild Knights and [[General/Legends|General]] [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles's]] [[Fleet Group Three]] to Borleias, where she participated in the [[Battle of Borleias (Yuuzhan Vong War; Second)|defense]] of the planet, with Wedge placing her in charge of all captured Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology. During that battle, Quee continued to work with the Wild Knights and also created a sensing device to determine if the Yuuzhan Vong were tracking refugee ships via one of their creatures. Her life was placed in danger when [[Tam Elgrin]], a [[Holocamera|holocam]] operator forcibly controlled by the Yuuzhan Vong, was assigned to spy on her as she was working on the [[Starlancer Project]]. Her efforts convinced the Yuuzhan Vong of the dangerous nature of the weapon, as planned. Elgrin was ordered to kill her, but he resisted the order, feeling that she did not deserve to die and because he was smitten with her. Eventually, Elgrin resisted his controllers, overcame his conditioning, and confessed his spying to Jaina Solo, ending the threat to Quee's life for the time being.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''</ref>\n\n===The tide turns===\n{{Quote|It's Danni Quee's doing. It has to be. She's the only one who could integrate Yuuzhan Vong and New Republic technology this way.|Viqi Shesh, on the Starlancer Project|The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream}}\nHowever, Quee did not stay on Borleias for the duration of the battle. Instead, she accompanied Luke, Mara, Jedi trainee [[Tahiri Veila]], and [[Wraith Squadron]] to occupied Coruscant.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" /> Disguised as a Yuuzhan Vong warrior, Quee and the others explored the planet, examining what the Vong had done during their occupation. The studies of Quee and [[Baljos Arnjak]], a member of Wraith Squadron, revealed that Coruscant was a thoroughly changed world and that it would not be the same for many years. Another part of their mission was learning the origins of the deranged [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Irek Ismaren|Lord Nyax]] after they stumbled into a secret chamber where he had been augmented to make him more lethal. Though she was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], Quee did not join the three other Jedi in hunting down Nyax, as she was scarcely trained and did not have a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. Her Jedi training, which had never really been a main focus for her, was sporadic, and she was not considered a full-fledged knight. Instead, she focused on her studies until the team evacuated in the starship ''[[Ugly Truth]]''. Her Force-sensitivity did allow her to experience the disturbances and influences that Nyax generated, distressing her as she felt the commands, negative emotions, and pain he released. Returning to Borleias, she once again served the [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]] there with her array of gravitic sensors and [[Jammer|jamming devices]] in the concluding stages of the battle.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing their evacuation from Borleias to [[Dac|Mon Calamari]] after the [[Domain Hul]] worldship was destroyed, Quee continued to conduct her research on Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology. However, the formation of the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances]] caused her team to be transferred from the Jedi to the government. Her part of the theoretical work was deemed complete, and she was given little else to do, despite her prior achievements. Instead of scientific research, she began training in setting up resistance cells and communications, determined to remain involved in the war effort. The lapse in activity also gave her some spare time to spend with friends such as fellow astrophysicist [[Thespar Trode]] and Jacen Solo, who had just escaped from Yuuzhan Vong torture and captivity. While out on a diving trip with Jacen, Quee told him about a group of geneticist friends of hers who were working with the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] on the Yuuzhan Vong genome. Quee would also later attend a reception thrown in honor of the young Jedi Knights, including Jacen, many of whom had just been knighted. Many of the Knights soon left for the planet [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] to join [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Traest Kre'fey]]'s fleet though, and she continued her work and training on the provisional capital of Mon Calamari.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way]]''</ref>\n\n===Into the Unknown===\n{{Quote|Why do I keep allowing myself to get talked into these things, Jacen?|Danni Quee, to Jacen Solo|The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant}}\n[[File:FFDanni2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Danni Quee with her scientific equipment]]\nIn the final months of the war, she accompanied Jacen, Mara Jade Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, Saba Sebatyne,&mdash;whom Quee persuaded to join them&mdash;the [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], and [[Jedi healer/Legends|Jedi healer]] [[Tekli]] to the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]] in an attempt to locate the living planet, [[Zonama Sekot/Legends|Zonama Sekot]]. Boarding the ''Jade Shadow'', the group set their course for the Unknown Regions.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic I: Remnant]]''</ref>\n\nTheir first layover was over Bastion, the Imperial capital, but they arrived in the midst of the [[Battle of Bastion]]. The ''Jade Shadow'' avoided most of the combat, retreating to [[Yaga Minor/Legends|Yaga Minor]] with the rest of the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial fleet]], although their reception by the Empire was somewhat frosty prior to the return of Pellaeon from Bastion. After Pellaeon and Jacen planned a trap for the Yuuzhan Vong at [[Borosk/Legends|Borosk]], Quee's yammosk detecting and jamming equipment was given to the Empire, and she flew in the ''Jade Shadow'' with Mara in the [[Battle of Borosk (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Borosk]]. However, when Saba Sebatyne proposed using a ship as bait for the Vong in order to free the slaves imprisoned inside a Yuuzhan Vong vessel, Pellaeon provided the [[Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser|''Dreadnaught''-class heavy cruiser]] ''[[Braxant Bonecrusher]]'' as a sacrificial vessel to get them close to the slave-carrier.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" />\n\nQuee, armored in a combat [[Jumpsuit/Legends|jumpsuit]], huddled in the ''Jade Shadow'', which was docked inside the ''Bonecrusher''{{'s}} [[Hangar/Legends|hangar bay]], until Jacen and the [[Droid/Legends|droid]] brains flew the ship past the [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] [[Carrier/Legends|carrier]]. Once the slave ship extended tentacles into the dreadnaught to search for victims to capture, Quee and Sebatyne were pulled through them into the Yuuzhan Vong vessel. Once inside, Quee launched miniature [[Assassin droid/Legends|assassin droids]] to attack the Yuuzhan Vong crew. With the crew defeated, she and Sebatyne got the [[Prisoner/Legends|prisoners]] out and back into the ''Bonecrusher'' using a mass of [[blorash jelly]], where they were cut out and the ship then jumped to safety. The Empire went on to win the battle, and the Yuuzhan Vong retreated. The stunt of Quee, Jacen, and Sebatyne also earned them the esteem of the Empire, and the [[Frigate/Legends|frigate]] [[Widowmaker (frigate)|''Widowmaker'']] joined their mission as an escort as they left the Empire.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" />\n\nThe expedition journeyed from planet to planet, looking for hints and traces of Zonama Sekot. Over [[Munlali Mafir]], after Jacen, Luke, and a small team of Imperials narrowly escaped the natives, they were met by a group of Chiss, who instructed them to arrive at the capital world of [[Csilla/Legends|Csilla]] to request authorization to pass through [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss space]]. In spite of their compliance, the Chiss initially denied their request to pass through, but gave them access to their massive [[Library/Legends|library]] of written [[Book/Legends|books]] of data and surveys. Quee was aided in her search for the living planet through the records, which gave them some information about Zonama Sekot's movements. Quee's knowledge of astronomy also was valuable in narrowing the data search; she suggested they focus on surveys of [[Star/Legends|stars]] that had captured planets.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nOn their way back to the ''Jade Shadow'' for a rest, Quee, Mara, Luke, and [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]]&mdash;a Human member of the Chiss Ascendancy&mdash;were attacked by a group of Fel's Chiss rivals. The group pretended to surrender, but before they disembarked from their ice barge, Fel's [[Marriage/Legends|wife]] [[Syal Antilles Fel]] programmed its cannons to fire at their adversaries, and the distraction was enough to allow the Jedi to quickly overwhelm their would-be captors. The result was that the Chiss became much more amicable towards them and gave them permission to pass through their space, but they still had yet to find a trace of Zonama Sekot. While Quee was talking with Jacen in the library about their relationship, her use of the phrase \"wandering satellites\" gave him an epiphany, and he realized that Zonama Sekot might have been acting as a [[Moon/Legends|moon]] in its journeys, going into orbit around another planet instead of around a star, as they had previously thought and based their search on.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\nTheir new search yielded results and they deduced that Zonama Sekot was hiding in the [[Klasse Ephemora system]], though hyperspace disturbances kept blocking them from reaching the system. The Force-sensitives, including Quee, joined together in a [[Force meld]] to guide them through the disturbances, and they reached the system, the ''Widowmaker'' behind them, to find Zonama Sekot beating off a Yuuzhan Vong [[Battle of Zonama Sekot (Yuuzhan Vong War)|attack]].<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion]]''</ref>\n\nAs it beat off the invaders, Zonama Sekot also unleashed a psychic wave that knocked out the crew of the ''Jade Shadow'', which Quee was onboard. She did not awake until a few hours after they landed on the planet, but was very impressed by the [[Sentience/Legends|sentient]] world once she did. Luke, Jacen, Quee, Imperial scientist [[Soron Hegerty]], and Mara were escorted to a dwelling in one of the native [[Ferroan]] settlements some distance away, though they had to leave their ship behind. Quee, along with the others, tried to convince the planet's consciousness to join the war efforts, but the consciousness, known as Sekot, was not eager to do so.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\n[[File:ForceHeretic3-Cover.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jacen Solo rescues Quee on Zonama Sekot.]]\nDuring the night, an angry group of Ferroans collapsed the roof of their dwelling and seized the unconscious Quee as a prisoner. They were pursued by Jacen and Sebatyne as they tried to escape with their prisoner. Once the two Jedi caught up with the kidnappers, Jacen realized that they were not hardened criminals and agreed to let himself and Saba be taken as hostages also so he could talk with their leader.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\nThe [[Magister]] of Zonama had also been taken by the same group, whose leader was a Ferroan named [[Senshi]] who resented the presence of outsiders. Quee was still knocked out by the evening, having been carried by stretcher to Senshi's compound, and Jacen attempted to use the Force to [[Force healing/Legends|heal]] her, as he was worried about her condition. Quee's life was particularly threatened by an angry [[bora]]s [[Plant/Legends|plant]] cluster, but Jacen convinced the plant to retreat while Sebatyne stood guard over her. Later, they realized that the whole kidnapping had been a test of them by Sekot and Quee awoke once the test was complete, none the worse for wear. Sekot agreed to return to known [[Realspace/Legends|space]] and aid the war effort.<ref name=\"Force Heretic III: Reunion\" />\n\n===The war's end and beyond===\n{{Quote|Danni Quee.

As the world prepared to arrive in Vong-occupied space, Quee explained the discoveries she had pioneered such as yammosk jamming and decoy [[dovin basal]]s to the world at its request, so it could prepare for a final confrontation with the Yuuzhan Vong. The world ultimately arrived near Coruscant and Quee had a chance to see old friends such as Han, Leia, and Jaina Solo, and other members of the [[New Jedi Order|Jedi Order]] before they launched the final [[Battle of Yuuzhan'tar|battle]] of the Yuuzhan Vong War.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref>\n\nSekot requested Tekli, Quee, and Cilghal to remain on the planet throughout the battle. Though Quee had originally planned to go with Luke and Mara to Coruscant, she acceded to Sekot's wishes, for neither she, Cilghal, nor Tekli were warriors anyway. It was while sitting in a Sekotan airship during the battle that Quee realized that she could never have a future as a Jedi, nor with Jacen Solo.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nShortly afterward, Sekot wished to speak to the Human scientist and revealed to her that Sekot did not wish to destroy the Yuuzhan Vong, even if they wished to destroy it. Instead, as Quee informed the others, the living world wanted to welcome the Vong to their new home, as the two species were closely related. Zonama Sekot revealed that it was a seed of the long-destroyed [[Yuuzhan'tar|Yuuzhan Vong homeworld]] from antiquity and that it wished to bring the Yuuzhan Vong to it for the purpose of re-shaping their culture from conquest and savagery. Those Yuuzhan Vong vessels not destroyed by the Galactic Alliance armada attacking Coruscant were drawn to Zonama Sekot or were withdrawn and later surrendered by [[Warmaster]] [[Nas Choka]], and the Yuuzhan Vong War ended after five destructive years. After the battle, Quee stayed on Zonama Sekot&mdash;along with Tahiri Veila and Tekli&mdash;to study the planet's flora and fauna, while Jacen left to follow his own path.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\nQuee remained a part of the New Jedi Order even as she studied Zonama Sekot. Following Luke Skywalker's [[Conclave on Ossus|Jedi convocation]] on the planet [[Ossus/Legends|Ossus]]<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" /> in [[36 ABY]],<ref name=\"Swarm war date\">''[[Dark Nest III: The Swarm War]]'' is set in [[36 ABY]], according to ''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> however, she resigned from the organization, as both she and Luke knew her destiny was on Zonama Sekot.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|<s></s>''This'' one is a scientist. This one didn't use to know how to kill.|Danni Quee, to Saba Sebatyne|The New Jedi Order: Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream}}\nQuee was a dedicated scientist with a passion for exploring and learning new things. That led her to the ExGal society, full of many other idealistic [[University/Legends|university]] students. Though she did not mind the sparse company the work required, she had begun to wonder whether she was wasting her life just prior to the Yuuzhan Vong War.<ref name=\"Staring at the Stars\" /> Quee was also known for her initiative and resilience, earning the respect of Yomin Carr, a Yuuzhan Vong infiltrator. While she was the subject of much male attention at ExGal-4, Quee ignored it, deferring romance for later in life,<ref name=\"vp\" /> though she hoped to one day be [[Marriage/Legends|married]] and have children.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nShe was horrified by the Yuuzhan Vong and their penchant for cruelty, though innately curious about their biotechnology. Her captivity and witnessing the death of the [[Padawan/Legends|Jedi apprentice]] Miko Reglia shocked her,<ref name=\"vp\" /> but she again displayed her inner strength by returning to the front lines of the war in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name=\"Star by Star\" />\n\nAs the war progressed, Quee continued to display her characteristic resourcefulness, endurance, and intelligence by providing the New Republic with valuable techniques to counter the Yuuzhan Vong, even risking her life several times to further the war effort.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" /> Quee was devoted to learning throughout her life, even giving up her place in the Jedi Order for the sake of learning, as she felt her future was on Zonama Sekot. Quee had never fully embraced the Jedi Order as others had, having never constructed a lightsaber or had an official master. As she had done throughout her short life, Quee did not shy away from making such hard choices. For the sake of learning and doing what she thought was her destiny, Quee gave up life on Commenor,<ref name=\"vp\" /> the Jedi Order, and Jacen Solo, whom she had some attraction to.<ref name=\"Dark Nest III: The Swarm War\" /> Quee stood at a height of 1.6 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]],<ref name=\"FF\" /> and had [[Color/Legends|blonde]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] green [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]<ref name=\"vp\" /> and light skin.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" />\n\n===Relationships===\n====Jacen Solo====\n{{Quote|Liquids under pressure don't boil when they should, and emotions tend to act the opposite way. I think you are wonderful, and I treasure you as a friend. Anything else, well, as you said, the future is constantly in motion.|Danni Quee, to Jacen Solo|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide I: Onslaught}}\n[[File:Jacen3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jacen Solo, whom Quee felt attracted to]]\nPrior to her first encounter with the Yuuzhan Vong, Quee displayed little interest in pursuing romantic relationships. After being rescued by Jacen Solo, Quee felt some attraction to him as he was there for her, comforting her after her capture and bringing her mementos and holos from her ruined station on Belkadan. For his part, Jacen saw Quee as the first woman he had been attracted to outside the [[Jedi academy|Jedi Academy]], and his seeing her as a \"damsel in distress,\" as well as the level of physical contact necessitated by the confines of the stylus ship they had blasted off Helska IV in, imparted a different dynamic to their relationship.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" />\n\nOn Dantooine, when she saw him next, Quee realized that he would be better as a friend for her, though, saying that under different circumstances something might have developed between them.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" /> On their expedition to the Unknown Regions, Quee again found herself attracted to Jacen, making efforts to spend time with him and worrying about his safety when he was in danger.<ref name=\"Force Heretic I: Remnant\" /> While they were on Csilla, she told him that she considered him a man that she was proud to call a friend, though Jacen felt she was talking about more than just friendship.<ref name=\"Force Heretic II: Refugee\" /> However, her time on Zonama Sekot opened her eyes and she knew her destiny was with the living planet, and not Jacen Solo. They parted ways at the end of the war.<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" />\n\n====Tam Elgrin====\nTam Elgrin was a holocam operator for [[Holojournalist/Legends|holojournalist]] [[Wolam Tser]], but was also a mind-controlled Yuuzhan Vong operative. While on Borleias, Quee obtained records and holos he had taken while on occupied Coruscant, and he was smitten with her. His attraction to the pretty young scientist was encouraged by his controller, [[Viqi Shesh]], who wanted him to use a relationship with Quee as a key to get more information. For her part, Quee realized that he was attracted to her, but did not reciprocate the attention, seeing it as an obstacle to her work. She would later deduce that he was working for the Yuuzhan Vong, and placed herself at personal danger to feed him misinformation, as Elgrin had been ordered to kill her by Shesh. However, in his admiration for Quee, he found the strength to resist his conditioning and was rescued and healed by Cilghal. His attraction ended after that, as Quee had left for Coruscant by that time.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nEven from a young age, Quee was considered a genius and a prodigy, particularly in the area of astronomy.<ref name=\"vp\" /> Quee was also skilled in the use of droids and [[Computer/Legends|computers]],<ref name=\"The Unifying Force\" /> as well as being mechanically adept. Her time at Belkadan also gave her a decent knowledge of survival skills and practical knowledge, in addition to her extensive education in the physical sciences. She spoke at least two languages, [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] and [[Twi'leki/Legends|Ryl]].<ref name=\"Staring at the Stars\" />\n\nDespite her killing of a redcrested cougar and her courage,<ref name=\"vp\" /> she was never a warrior and was unskilled with conventional weapons or lightsabers.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" /> Quee had some piloting skills,<ref name=\"vp\" /> but was not an accomplished pilot. When it was discovered that she was Force-sensitive, Quee received some training in the use of the Force from Jaina Solo. She was a quick study, learning basic telekinesis easily and saved Lando Calrissian's life with the skill.<ref name=\"Dark Tide I: Onslaught\" /> While she was held prisoner by the Yuuzhan Vong, she was able to unconsciously send out a [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathic]] call for help through the Force, despite having had no training in the use of the Force or even knowing at the time that she was Force-sensitive, whereas Miko Reglia, who was a trained Jedi, failed to do so.<ref name=\"vp\" />\n\nAs the war progressed, Quee became one of the New Republic's leading experts on Yuuzhan Vong biotechnology, delving into the field of biology to understand how their creatures and biots worked.<ref name=\"Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream\" /> Later, after the primary breakthroughs such as yammosk jamming had been developed, she turned to other areas, being trained in infiltration and communications in preparation for setting up resistance cells.<ref name=\"Destiny's Way\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Danni-JF01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A portrait of Danni Quee from the canceled ''Knightfall'' trilogy]]\nDanni Quee first appeared in the first installment of the [[Star Wars: The New Jedi Order|''New Jedi Order'' series]], the [[1999]] novel ''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]'', written by [[R.

However, after the first novel was completed, the trilogy was canceled due to the dissatisfaction of [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] and [[Del Rey]] regarding how the story was advancing.<ref name=\"Unjoh\">In [[2002]], [[Shelly Shapiro]] revealed that the ''[[Knightfall Trilogy]]'' had been canceled via a letter to a poster on the JediNet website.
