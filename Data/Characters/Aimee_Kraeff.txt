Working to support her family, Kraeff eventually abandoned her home in the Scraplands in hope of finding a better existence elsewhere. A teenager alone in the wastes, Kraeff was beset by [[Mantellian Savrip/Legends|Savrips]] in an attack that left her severely scarred and half-dead. Rescued by nomads, she was nursed back to health in the village before being taken to [[Worlport/Legends|Worlport]].\n[[File:Fight_Night_The_Loaded_Savrip_Proudly_Presents_Flutterplume.png|thumb|left|200px|A holographic advertisement promoting Flutterplume,]]\nWhile participating in underground blood sports to survive on the streets, Kraeff discovered a knack for fighting and eventually earned a reputation for herself. Going by the stage name \"Flutterplume\", so called for her exotic outfit and feathered mask and its resemblance to the [[Mantellian flutterplume/Legends|bird of the same name]], Kraeff managed to get a stable income to support herself and her apartment in Westwall District. Taking on four fights a week, Flutterplume hoped to make herself a small fortune so as to better help her parents, whom she sent credits to on a regular basis. When not fighting, Kraeff used a pair of [[Vibroknuckler/Legends|vibroknucklers]] for her own protection on the streets.<ref name=\"MPQ\" />\n\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War]], the [[Gambler/Legends|gambler]] [[Illo Vandin]] wanted to see Kraeff throw her match to bring shame upon one of her avid fans and the [[Herglic/Legends|Herglic's]] rival, the [[Pirate King|Pirate Queen]] of the [[Veiled Sorority/Legends|Veiled Sorority]]. Sending agents to speak with her on three occasions, Vandin had grown impatient with her commitment to winning the bout. At the same time, Kraeff was concerned with the well-being of her family, who unbeknownst to her, had been abducted by slavers and taken to the town [[Rusty Reach]].<ref name=\"MPQ\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Mask of the Pirate Queen]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kraeff, Aimee}}\n[[Category:Athletes]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mantellians]]"}}}]}}}}
