The Dug wielded a pair of knives in his feet as his primary weapon, and was shown to be extremely acrobatic, swinging around railings and poles to dodge enemy blaster fire and quickly close the distance to them. He even deflected a blaster bolt by spinning the blades quickly in circles.\n\nHe found and attacked Sagoro Autem, but was shot dead by Evan Hessler before he could claim the prize.\n\n==Biography==\nIn [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], two weeks after the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] between the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatists]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]], Tartura&mdash;a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Dug/Legends|Dug]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]]&mdash; was hired by the newly formed [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] to hunt down [[Sagoro Autem]]. Autem, a [[Captain/Legends|captain]] in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]], had been slated for [[Emperor's purge|purging]] from the [[Imperial Military/Legends|Imperial Military]], but had managed to escape before [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]] could apprehend him. Tartuta, a [[Shistavanen/Legends|Shistavanen]] named [[Severian]], and a masked [[Human/Legends|Human]] named [[Evan Hessler]], were told by the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] to apprehend Autem, alive or dead.\n\nRather than waste time tracking Autem himself, Tartuta followed the Shistavanen bounty hunter, reasoning that they were excellent trackers. His gambit paid off as Severian found the target within a few hours, leading the Dug right to Autem. Before Severian could take the bounty, Tartuta attacked him and lopped off his right hand, sending him tumbling off the walkway he was perched on. The Dug turned his knives on Sagoro, using his acrobatic skills to dodge defensive blaster fire. As he closed on Autem, however, he was shot in the back and killed by Evan Hessler. Sagoro, unaware of how the Dug had died, took one of his knives for extra protection and continued on.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Republic 78|''Republic'' 78]] {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Tartuta\n|pl=Tartuta\n|pt=Tartuta\n}}\n\n[[Category:Bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Dugs]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
