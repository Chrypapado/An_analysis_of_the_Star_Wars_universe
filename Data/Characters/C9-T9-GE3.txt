Due to the installed protocols it was unbeatable by any other racer.\n\nAfter racing and losing, [[Meetra Surik]] studied the mechanics of the droid and modified its protocols, making the droid think it was losing and causing a self-destruction. In this manner Surik was able to beat the best time and to retrieve the prize. [[Lupo Shar]] soon had to leave the swoop business and left it to [[Borna Lys]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=C9-T9-GE3\n}}\n\n[[Category:GE3-series protocol droids]]\n[[Category:Droids with masculine programming]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]"}}}]}}}}
