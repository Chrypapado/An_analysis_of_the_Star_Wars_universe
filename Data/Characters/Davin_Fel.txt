There, he grew up among the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] and was admitted to a [[Syndic Mitth'raw'nuruodo training academy|Chiss military academy]], in which he was criticized by his instructors for a willingness to disobey orders or depart from battle plans in order to save others. He graduated and served as a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] in the Empire of the Hand's military, in which capacity he was killed at age twenty.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|And as for fighting for my freedom, I've been doing that in the Unknown Regions for all my life. My mother gave birth to five children. My older brother died fighting, as did a younger sister.|Jagged Fel to [[Borsk Fey'lya]]|The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin}}\nDavin Fel was born to [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]] and [[Syal Antilles Fel]] on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] early in their marriage. Soontir Fel was a prominent and skilled [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Starfighter/Legends|fighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], while Syal was an Imperial actress under the stage name Wynssa Starflare. Relatively soon after Fel's birth, Syal took him and his younger brother [[Chak Fel|Chak]] to Soontir's baronial [[Fel estate|estate]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] to live with Soontir's [[Fel dynasty|relatives]]. They were there in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]] when Soontir went missing during the [[Battle of Brentaal IV (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Brentaal IV]]; fearful of retribution from Soontir's enemy [[Director of Imperial Intelligence]] [[Ysanne Isard]], Syal took the children and fled.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" />\n\nThey spent months in hiding before Syal was reunited with Soontir, who had defected to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] after being captured.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" /> They continued to remain in hiding, however, and Fel's very existence was apparently kept secret, with not even Syal's brother, [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], seeming to know of the children's existence.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" /><ref name=\"Iron Fist\">''[[X-Wing: Iron Fist]]''</ref> Not long afterward, Isard succeeded in capturing Soontir, turning him over to [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]], known by his [[Core name/Legends|core name]] Thrawn. Thrawn convinced Soontir that he needed his aid in pacifying the myriad threats of the [[Unknown Regions/Legends|Unknown Regions]]. Soontir became a [[General/Legends|general]] in the [[Empire of the Hand]], which Thrawn had set up to bring stability to the Unknown Regions.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\">''[[Vision of the Future]]''</ref> A few months later, Syal and the children joined him, their disappearance engineered by Thrawn, on the Empire of the Hand's headquarters on [[Nirauan/Legends|Nirauan]].<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" /><ref name=\"Fact File 122\" />\n\n[[File:NssisClassClawcraft-NEGVV.png|thumb|left|180px|A ''Nssis''-class clawcraft, the type Fel piloted.]]\nFel was reared in the Unknown Regions, where he and Chak were joined by two younger brothers&mdash;[[Jagged Fel|Jagged]] and [[Cem Fel|Cem]], with Cem being hidden from all others outside the family as a [[shadow child]] to preserve the line&mdash;and two younger sisters&mdash;[[Cherith Fel|Cherith]] and [[Wynssa Fel|Wynssa]].<ref name=\"Ruin\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\">''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]''</ref><ref name=\"The Joiner King\">''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''</ref> When Thrawn returned to the known regions of space to take command of the Empire, the Empire of the Hand was left in the hands of [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Voss Parck/Legends|Voss Parck]], with Soontir a senior officer. The Empire of the Hand remained secret, battling against the various threats found in the Unknown Regions. It consisted not only of Thrawn's Imperial forces but of members of Thrawn's species who rejected the ban their society, the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]], imposed on preemptive strikes.<ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" />\n\nFel was raised by his father amidst the grim, duty-oriented [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] culture. Chiss children matured early, and Fel correspondingly began his career early as well. Soontir used his Chiss subordinate [[Kres'ten'tarthi]] to secure Fel's acceptance into a [[Syndic Mitth'raw'nuruodo training academy|Chiss military academy]], where Fel served as a guarantee of his father's good faith toward the Chiss.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\">''[[Red Sky, Blue Flame]]''</ref> There he was trained on the [[Nssis-class Clawcraft|''Nssis''-class clawcraft]], the Empire of the Hand's preferred fighter. While Fel graduated, the Chiss instructors regarded him as having been rash, undisciplined, and too quick to would-be heroic action rather than unquestioningly obeying authority, as the Chiss preferred.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> His younger brother Jagged, who idolized him, followed him into the academy after he had already graduated, where Jagged was offered much the same criticism and compared to his older brother.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" />\n\nFel continued on into military service with the Empire of the Hand as a pilot, as his brother Chak did, waging war against the menaces of the Unknown Regions.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" /> He was killed in battle at age twenty in the course of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, but was remembered fondly by his family.<ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" /> His father, who had been his military superior, felt the burden of Fel's death heavily, and Jagged was hurt by the loss of his hero.<ref name=\"Ruin\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|The disregard of rules, the presumption of an individual who placed his impulses above the collective wisdom of tradition and clan, this we cannot allow. You are your brother all over again.|[[Gimald Nuruodo]] to Jagged Fel|Red Sky, Blue Flame}}\n[[File:Fel_and_Starflare.png|thumb|right|160px|Fel's parents, Soontir and Syal Antilles Fel.]]\n\nFel could be impulsive, seeking to take quick and risky action to save others against his instructors' will, a trait for which they reprimanded him. In Chiss society, there was little room for those who disobeyed orders or broke from battle plans from what they saw as misguided heroism.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDavin Fel was first referenced indirectly in ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'', by [[Michael A. Stackpole]], when Jagged Fel stated that both his older brother and younger sister had died in combat.<ref name=\"Ruin\" /> [[Elaine Cunningham]]'s ''[[Red Sky, Blue Flame]]'' then established that Jagged's older brother was Davin; ''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'', by the same author, established that Davin had indeed been the brother who died.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /> Fel's only further narrative mention was in ''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]''.<ref name=\"The Joiner King\" /> He has never actually appeared in any story, only being mentioned.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" /><ref name=\"Ruin\" /><ref name=\"Dark Journey\" /><ref name=\"The Joiner King\" />\n\nIn both ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 122]]'' and ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 140]]'', Fel is incorrectly stated to have died in the [[Battle of Ithor]].<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" /><ref name=\"Fact File 140\">''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 140]]''</ref> That battle took place after his death, as clearly established in the source which originated him, ''Dark Tide II: Ruin''.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n''The Official Star Wars Fact File 122'' established Soontir Fel as having multiple children before his defection; given the established chain of ages, these could only be Chak and Davin. While that issue of ''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File]]'' was riddled with errors regarding the Fel family, this piece of information does not actually conflict with any canon and so has been incorporated into this article.<ref name=\"Fact File 122\" /> Therefore, Davin Fel must have existed during Soontir Fel's time in the New Republic, but no mention of him was ever made, while Soontir constantly fretted about his wife, and no one in the New Republic displayed any knowledge of any Fel children, only of Syal, suggesting very strongly that Davin's existence was kept secret.<ref name=\"The Making of Baron Fel\">[[X-Wing Rogue Squadron 25|''X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' 25]]</ref><ref name=\"Vision of the Future\" /><ref name=\"Iron Fist\" />\n\nIn ''Red Sky, Blue Flame'', Jagged Fel is said to be Soontir Fel's last living son, which would require Davin Fel to be dead at that point. This has been contradicted by the appearance of Chak Fel in ''[[Survivor's Quest]]'', and by ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' establishing that Davin Fel was twenty at the time of his death; he could not have been born before 1 ABY and therefore would have been no older than eighteen in 19 ABY.<ref name=\"Red Sky, Blue Flame\" /><ref name=\"Survivor's Quest\">''[[Survivor's Quest]]''</ref><ref name=\"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{GamerCite|7|Red Sky, Blue Flame}} {{1stID}} {{Mo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Tide II: Ruin]]'' {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Dark Journey]]'' {{Mo}}\n*''[[Dark Nest I: The Joiner King]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|122}}\n*{{FFCite|140|FEL2, ''Baron Soontir Fel''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{Topps|set=2011 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 6|cardname=Shea Standefer sketch cards}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|da=Davin Fel\n|ru=\u0414\u044d\u0432\u0438\u043d \u0424\u0435\u043b\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fel, Davin}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Empire of the Hand pilot corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Fel family]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nirauan residents]]"}}}]}}}}
