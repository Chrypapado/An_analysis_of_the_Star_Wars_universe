They'll never stop us.|Biggs Darklighter, to Luke Skywalker, just before the Battle of Yavin|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n'''Biggs Darklighter''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[ace]] [[pilot]] who fought for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the early days of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He grew up on the [[desert]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]], where he became a close boyhood friend of [[Luke Skywalker]]. The two became pilots and dreamed of leaving Tatooine. Darklighter left his homeworld for the [[Imperial Academy]], but defected from the [[Galactic Empire]] after graduation in order to join the Rebel Alliance. He returned to Tatooine one final time to tell Skywalker of his plans.\n\nWith his home planet behind him, Darklighter relocated to the [[Great Temple|Rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]]. He reunited with Skywalker, who had helped rescue [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], a leader in the Alliance, from the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] with [[Death Star plans|stolen plans]] for the planet-destroying space station. The Rebellion analyzed the plans and organized the [[Battle of Yavin]], where Darklighter and Skywalker flew as members of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] in the assault on the station. Skywalker successfully destroyed the Death Star, but not before Darklighter was killed in combat by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Leaving Tatooine===\n{{Quote|And you said I'd never make it through Mushroom Mesa, Biggs!''\"<br>\"''Don't get too cocky, Skyboy.|[[Luke Skywalker]] and Biggs|Star Wars (2015) 15}}\n[[File:Biggs_SW15.jpg|thumb|left|206px|Biggs in his youth.]]\nBiggs Darklighter grew up on the [[desert]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]], raised by [[Biggs Darklighter's mother|his mother]].<ref name=\"Desert Son\">{{Shortstory|story=Desert Son|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> He eventually became close friends with [[Luke Skywalker]].

Keeping in contact with his friend via [[comlink]], Biggs warned Skywalker not to get too cocky after he made it through [[Mushroom Mesa]], warning him of the dangerous Beggar's Canyon ahead. Although Biggs cautioned Luke to slow down through the tight canyon, Skywalker ignored his advice and ultimately crashed the skyhopper after clipping the edge of the canyon, requiring new tools and repair parts to fix the damage.<ref name=\"SW15\">[[Star Wars (2015) 15|''Star Wars'' (2015) 15]]</ref>\n\nWhen they were young, Darklighter and Skywalker both dreamed of leaving their homeworld behind and attending the [[Imperial Academy]].<ref name=\"Bio Gallery\" /> Darklighter eventually left Tatooine for the Academy, but Skywalker was left behind, as his uncle, [[Owen Lars]], would not allow him to leave out of fear that he would follow in the footsteps of his father: the [[Jedi Knight]]-turned-[[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker]].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> After attending the Academy, Darklighter and his fellow pilot [[Derek Klivian]] received their commissions aboard the ''[[Rand Ecliptic]]'',<ref name=\"USW\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> with Darklighter assigned as [[First Mate|first mate]] of the [[Starship|vessel]].<ref name=\"ST:CL 2016\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> Klivian, who was secretly undercover as an [[agent]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]],<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars NE\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''</ref> incited a [[Mutiny on the Rand Ecliptic|mutiny]], assisting Darklighter's defection to the Rebellion.<ref name=\"ST:CL 2016\" />\n\n[[File:LukeBiggs2-MOSW.png|thumb|right|250px|Darklighter tells Skywalker of his plans to join the Rebel Alliance.]]\nAfter graduating from the Imperial Academy, Darklighter returned to Tatooine to visit Skywalker and his friends in [[Tosche Station]]. When Skywalker arrived at Tosche Station, he claimed to have witnessed a battle in the skies over Tatooine. Darklighter and the others were skeptical, however, and the now-[[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] pilot believed that it was simply two ships sitting in orbit. In actuality, Skywalker had witnessed a [[Secret mission to Tatooine|battle]] between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Although Darklighter wasn't involved in the battle, his return did deal with the Rebel Alliance: he told Skywalker that he would be defecting from the Empire and becoming a pilot for the Rebel Alliance. As the two said their goodbyes, Darklighter told his old friend that he would keep an eye out for him, in the event Skywalker ever joined the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Bio Gallery\" />\n\n===Joining the Rebel Alliance===\n====Taking a vacation====\n{{Quote|There's a vacation planet with such a struggling economy that the exchange rate really works in our favor.|Biggs Darklighter to Jek Tono Porkins.|Stolen Valor}}\n[[File:Biggs and Porkins on Irff..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Biggs and Porkins during their vacation on the planet Irff.]]\nDarklighter joined the Rebel Alliance shortly after leaving Tatooine, and was assigned to the Rebel base on [[Yavin 4]].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> During his time on Yavin 4, Darklighter and [[Jek Tono Porkins]] took a vacation to the [[planet]] [[Irff]], a planet where littering was encouraged. After staying on the planet for twelve days, a worker told them both that their resting area was reserved. The worker then kicked them out after they refused to move. The spot was reserved for a [[Unidentified female Imperial officer (Irff)|female Imperial officer]]. Later Darklighter and Porkins pretended to point blasters under towels at the officer to scare her away. She then told them that she was just a single parent of six children who wanted to take a break and a vacation from them. Her children were named [[Brit]], [[Blip]], [[Flip (Irff)|Flip]], [[Jeef]], [[Gerf]], [[Bilf]], and [[Arnold]]. Porkins then apologized to her and he and Darklighter left. When outside her vacation house, she called security on them. While running from security, Darklighter and Porkins tried to escape on a green creature but the creature tried to eat Darklighter and both of them then escaped. Later, security caught Darklighter and Porkins and told them to leave or the manager would be called.<ref name=\"SV\">{{Shortstory|story=Stolen Valor|book=Age of Rebellion Special 1|bformatted=''Age of Rebellion Special'' 1|manual=1}}</ref>\n\n====The Battle of Yavin====\n{{Quote|Hurry up, Luke! Quick! Quick!|Biggs Darklighter's final words, at the Battle of Yavin|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nIn the meantime, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of [[Alderaan]], a leader in the Rebel Alliance, successfully brought [[Battle of Scarif|stolen]] [[Death Star plans|plans]] for the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] to the Rebel base; this was done with the help of Skywalker, [[Han Solo]], and the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], who aided in Organa's [[Rescue of Princess Leia|escape]] after she had been held prisoner by the Empire on the Death Star. Using the plans, the Rebel Alliance put together an attack plan to destroy the planet-destroying space station, which arrived near Yavin 4 with the intention of destroying it&mdash;as well as the Rebel Alliance. Darklighter was assigned to be a fighter pilot in the assault.<ref name=\"ANH\" /> Skywalker had also become a pilot in the Rebellion. During [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s briefing, Biggs heard his friend's voice before brushing apart with fellow pilot [[Jek Tono Porkins]], who playfully teased him.<ref name=\"Desert Son\" />\n\n[[File:BiggsDarklighter-SbtDS.png|thumb|right|250px|Darklighter prepares to board his X-wing before the battle.]]\nIn the lead-up to the battle, Darklighter encountered Skywalker in the Rebel hangar. The two reminisced about their time flying on Tatooine, and Darklighter vouched for Skywalker as the best bush pilot in the [[Outer Rim Territories]] when [[Garven Dreis]], the leader of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], questioned whether the rookie pilot would be able to handle an [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighter]].<ref name=\"ANH\" /> Before climbing on their respective starfighters, Biggs promised Skywalker to exchange stories with him, leading Luke to tell him that he told him that he would make it some day. As he boarded his X-wing, [[Wedge Antilles]] asked Darklighter who the kid was, to which Darklighter responded that the kid was a friend from who said he would join the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Desert Son\" />\n\nThe [[Battle of Yavin]] started afterwards. As the pilots approached the Death Star, Darklighter found himself grappling with fear. When Garven asked the pilots to report in, Biggs replied that \"[[Red Three]]\" was his [[callsign]]. Under \"[[Red Leader]]\"'s command, Biggs and his fellow pilots locked their S-foils into attack position and switched their deflectors on double front.<ref name=\"Desert Son\" /> Descending on the [[battle station]], Biggs and his fellow pilots dodged [[turbolaser]] bolts fired by the Death Star's heavy turbolaser emplacements, which were too slow for the nimble rebel fighters. As Biggs asked Porkins to cover his starfighter from behind, Porkin was unfortunately shot down. Managing to move his X-wing out of harm's way in the nick of time thanks to Skywalker, allowing his friend to shot down one of the [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter]]s behind him, Biggs strafed the turbolaser towers that were peppering the Y-wing [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]], which were flying through the [[Meridian trench]] to take out the [[thermal exhaust port]].<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\n[[File:Biggs_death.png|thumb|left|250px|Darklighter's X-wing gets destroyed during the Battle of Yavin.]]\nAs the battle neared its end, Garven was shot down, with Biggs along Skywalker and Antilles remaining.<ref name=\"ANH\" /> As he and Antilles resolved to buy Skywalker enough time to reach the thermal exhaust port and drop his payload of [[proton torpedo]]es, Darklighter imagined like if they were racing through Beggar's Canyon shooting [[womp rat]]s.<ref name=\"Desert Son\" /> With Wedge forced to pull out due his X-wing facing mechanical problems, Biggs concluded that he and Skywalker were the only ones who remained. Cornered by [[Darth]] Vader's [[TIE Advanced x1]] and two remaining TIE fighters, Biggs resolved to sacrifice his life to ensure Luke's survival, diverting power to the X-wing's engines. Immediately, Darklighter's X-wing was hit by enemy fire from Vader, killing him in the process.<ref name=\"ANH\" /> As the ship exploded, Darklighter heard the call of his mother for dinner and felt Tatooine's wind sweeping across the desert as he died; overcoming his fear and making peace with life.<ref name=\"Desert Son\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nShortly after Darklighter's death, Skywalker destroyed the Death Star.<ref name=\"ANH\" /> After the Battle of Yavin, Skywalker continued to think of his late friend and his sacrifice. Skywalker consoled himself knowing that Darklighter was a strong believer in the cause that he died for, and hoped that each new mission would destroy the Empire and honor Darklighter's sacrifice.<ref name=\"Heir to the Jedi\">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>\n\nIn [[34 ABY]], during his self-imposed [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on [[Ahch-To]], the [[Jedi Master]] Luke Skywalker had a [[dream]] about an alternate life where he ignored Organa's message and never joined the rebellion, remaining in the moisture farming business with his uncle and [[Marriage|marrying]] [[Camie Marstrap]]. In his dream, Darklighter was killed somewhere unimaginably far away, but Skywalker never got to know the details of his demise whilst his family was taken away by [[stormtrooper]]s, leaving their farm to be stripped by [[Jawa]]s and [[Tusken Raider]]s.<ref name=\"The Last Jedi Novel\">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\nBiggs Darklighter was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] with hazel [[eye]]s, black [[hair]], and light skin. As a member of the Rebel Alliance, Darklighter was a believer in its cause against the Empire. Skywalker felt that Darklighter would have thought that joining the Alliance was worth the risk and worth dying for, even if Darklighter had known he would perish in the Battle of Yavin.<ref name=\"Heir to the Jedi\" /> He also felt concern for Skywalker, whose story he would listen to with amusement and patience,<ref name=\"Bio Gallery\" /> and defended him when Garven Dreis questioned whether Skywalker was ready to fly with Red Squadron.<ref name=\"ANH\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|Hey, don't knock T-16s.
