The clan was stationed a the [[Bogden Jedi chapter house|Jedi chapter house]] on [[Bogden 3]]. They were awaiting transport back to the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]], which had been delayed due to the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|battle]] there. When Masters K'Kruhk and [[Sian Jeisel]] arrived with their clone troopers, [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] was issued. Several of the younglings were [[Massacre on Bogden 3|killed]] as [[Du Mahn]] defended them. K'Kruhk and Piru ultimately escaped with nine younglings to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, Sidirri was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk.\n\n===Great Jedi Purge===\nSidirri was present when [[Lumbra]] and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that the broken ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, fellow youngling, [[Seddwia]], jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi younglings, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].\n\nThe younglings were freed by [[K'Kruhk]] who gave in to un-Jedi like behavior briefly. With the help of Chase Piru he shot down Lumbra's men with arrows. Lumbra and his shipmate, Callow, died at the hands of K'Kruhk's [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]]. After witnessing K'Kruhk's rage, the youngling began to show signs of succumbing to the dark side, until finally on the planet [[Arkinnea]], she gave into her rage to crush a group of [[Arkinnea Militia]] that were pursuing them to eliminate them as witnesses to the militia's murder of refugees after believing that the militia had killed K'Kruhk.<ref name=\"FC5\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5]]''</ref> Despite the Jedi escaping to the [[Hidden Temple (Arkinnea)|Hidden Temple]] on the world, Sidirri would eventually flee the temple. Jedi Master [[Zao]] would set off in pursuit of her, but neither would be seen again by the Jedi in the temple.<ref name=\"FC5\">''[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5]]''</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nSince her creation, Sidirri was intended to be the [[Dargulli Dark Jedi|woman]] who attempted to become [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] apprentice before being killed by the Dark Lord himself on [[Dargulli/Legends|Dargulli]].<ref name=\"wannabe\">{{FacebookCite|author=Randy Stradley Dark Horse|dateposted=January 2, 2015|description=Wanabee Sith|url=permalink.php?story_fbid=856179077780153&id=120655541332514&fref=nf|dateaccessed=January 5, 2015|image=File:RandyStradleyDarkHorse.png}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Dark Times 6|''Dark Times'' 6]] {{1st}}\n*[[Dark Times 7|''Dark Times'' 7]]\n*[[Dark Times 8|''Dark Times'' 8]]\n*[[Dark Times 9|''Dark Times'' 9]]\n*[[Dark Times 10|''Dark Times'' 10]]\n*[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 1|''Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier'' 1]]\n*[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 2|''Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier'' 2]] {{1stID}}\n*[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 3|''Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier'' 3]]\n*[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 4|''Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier'' 4]]\n*[[Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier 5|''Dark Times\u2014Fire Carrier'' 5]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bogden residents]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Former Jedi]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Jedi Purge survivors]]\n[[Category:Jedi trainees of the Jedi Order]]\n[[Category:Soaring Hawkbat Clan]]"}}}]}}}}
