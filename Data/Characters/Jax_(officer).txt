Jax could either appear as a Human man with brown hair and brown eyes, or as a Human woman with brown hair and brown eyes. The quest dialogue did not offer any details concerning Jax's appearance, therefore Jax's gender remains ambiguous. In the game, the other colleague which accompanied Officer Jax went unnamed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jax}}\n[[Category:Corellian Security Force officers]]\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]"}}}]}}}}
