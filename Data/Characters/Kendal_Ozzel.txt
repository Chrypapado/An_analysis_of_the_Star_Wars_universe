[[Reproduction|Born]] on the [[planet]] [[Carida]] prior to the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the Empire, he served in the [[Galactic Republic Navy|Republic Navy]] as a [[Republic officer|commissioned officer]] during the [[Clone Wars]]&mdash;a civil war fought in [[the galaxy]] during the [[Republic Era|last years]] of the Republic. After the war, his [[Imperial Military|military]] [[Imperial officer|career]] would continue under the [[New Order|new regime]] established by [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. Ozzel gave up everything for the Empire, even giving up his chance at a simple life with his [[Kendal Ozzel's fianc\u00e9e|fianc\u00e9e]].\n\nAs an [[admiral]], Ozzel was the commanding officer of the ''[[Executor]]''&mdash;an [[Imperial Navy]] [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] and the [[flagship]] of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]&mdash;at the [[time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. In the [[Standard year|year]] [[3 ABY]], he oversaw the initial [[Battle of Hoth|attack]] on [[Hoth]] after the Empire discovered the location of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance's]] [[Echo Base|secret base]], but was [[Force choke|summarily executed]] by way of [[the Force]] as a result of Vader's displeasure in the admiral's fundamentally incompetent tactics. As he was choked, Ozzel realized he had given his life over to authoritarians, though it was too late to change all he had done. Following Ozzel's [[death]], his [[Military rank|rank]] and command were awarded to his [[captain]], [[Firmus Piett]], by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early service===\n{{Quote|Join the rebel forces.|Kendal Ozzel's fianc\u00e9e offers him a life against the Empire|Kendal}}\nA [[Gender|male]] [[human]] [[Reproduction|born]] into a wealthy family from [[Carida]], Kendal Ozzel attended multiple [[Core Worlds|Core World]] institutes in his youth.

Thus, Ozzel could have had a simpler life and be married on his [[homeworld]] of Carida, with his friends and family in attendance. However, one night, his fianc\u00e9e offered him a chance to join the rebellion against the Empire. Having already decided his loyalty was to the Empire, Ozzel and his would be wife cried and held each other for the night before parting ways forever the next morning.<ref name=\"Kendal\" /> Ozzel thus served in the [[Imperial Navy]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> In [[14 BBY]],<ref name=\"Tarkin date\">{{TarkinDate}}</ref> he held the rank of [[Rear Admiral]], and was a member of the [[Joint Chiefs]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\n===Admiralship===\n[[File:Tagge's_death.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ozzel witnesses Tagge's death at Vader's hand, a fate he would one day share.]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of Yavin|destruction]] of the First [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], he had become an [[Admiral]]. He personally issued a communique to the Imperial Starfleet ordering the fleet to enter battle readiness.<ref name=\"Smuggler's Run\">''[[Smuggler's Run: A Han Solo & Chewbacca Adventure]]''</ref> After this occurred the [[Hijacking of the Executor|Hijacking of the ''Executor'']], in which the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] dispatched the [[scientist]] [[Cylo]], who had attempted to steal the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]''. The [[Super Star Destroyer|SSD]] was originally designed to be given to [[Grand General]] [[Cassio Tagge]], however, [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] demoted him to [[General]], and gave the ''Executor'' to Vader, due to Tagge's trust of Cylo. Vader [[The Force|force]] [[Force choke|choked]] Tagge on his new [[command ship]]'s [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] in front of Ozzel.

As the Sith Lord looked out over the world's landscape, the admiral relayed how the Death Star's destruction had galvanized the rebellion. Resources for the Empire's construction projects were being delayed and what Rebel forces there were were too scattered and well hidden to make effective progress against. Ozzel went on to suggest that a fleet carrying out a world-by-world bombardment would serve as a suitable deterrent and told Vader that the Death Squadron had to be the force that applying the bombardment. Just as he was saying it was ludicrous to not use the fleet, Vader interrupted him by questioning the admiral's usage of the word ludicrous.<ref name=\"Shu-Torun Lives\">{{Shortstory|story=Shu-Torun Lives|book=Star Wars (2015) 50|bformatted=''Star Wars'' 50|manual=1}}</ref>\n\nAfter apologizing, Ozzel went on to question how they could eliminate the Rebels, comparing them to vermin. Veers then spoke up and contradicted the Admiral, instead comparing them to weeds. Angered, Ozzel kept his gaze on Veers as the general explained how weeds survive storms and how the Rebellion would continue to survive Imperial attacks as they were flexible and not as sturdy as a tree. Turning his attention back to Vader, Ozzel addressed the Sith Lord after he showed interest in what Veers had said.<ref name=\"Shu-Torun Lives\" />\n\n===Searching for the Rebel base===\n{{Quote|We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!|Admiral Ozzel|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\n[[File:YouSuckPiett-ESBHD.jpg|thumb|260px|Ozzel and Piett preparing for the attack on Hoth.]]\nHe later became the commanding [[Imperial officer|officer]]<ref name=\"ESB\" /> of the [[Death Squadron]], an armada of Imperial [[Starship|vessels]]<ref name=\"ISD-SWE\">{{SWE|technology|imperialstardestroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer}}</ref> tasked with locating the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Alliance's]] hidden main base in the aftermath of the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], though the [[fleet]] was under the ''de facto'' control of Vader. In his capacity as admiral of the fleet, Ozzel led [[Death]] [[Squadron]] from Vader's [[flagship]], the ''Executor''.<ref name=\"ESB\" /> As he had been assigned to oversee the Empire's search for the Rebel headquarters, Ozzel felt that he was the perfect being to command the massive [[warship]] during the [[Hunting|hunt]].<ref name=\"SWE\" /> During his time as the senior [[officer]] aboard the ''Executor'', Ozzel took time to personally congratulate [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Ciena Ree]], a young officer whose service had been outstanding for the past two [[Standard year|years]]. After commending Ree for her dedication, the admiral implied that she might obtain a promotion to the rank of Commander soon enough.<ref name=\"Lost Stars\">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>\n\nThe Empire dispatched thousands of [[probe droid]]s throughout [[the galaxy]] to participate in the search for the Rebel base, [[XJ9-CS14|one]] of which discovered signs of an [[Echo Base|occupied settlement]] on the [[Water|ice]] [[planet]] [[Hoth]]. Before being destroyed by Rebel Captain [[Han Solo]], the [[droid]] relayed its data to the ''Executor'', where it was reviewed by Admiral Ozzel, his subordinate, Captain [[Firmus Piett]], and General Veers of the [[Imperial Army]]. Piett cited the data as their best lead in the search, but Ozzel dismissed the information as lacking definitive proof of any Rebel presence. Nevertheless, Vader overruled him and ordered the fleet to make haste to the [[Hoth system]] to deal with the Rebels headquartered there.<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\nAs Vader withdrew to his [[Darth Vader's meditation chamber|private quarters]], Ozzel assumed command of the fleet's maneuvering and pre-battle strategy. Believing he could surprise and overwhelm the Rebels, Ozzel opted to have the [[Star Destroyer]]s of Death Squadron emerge from [[hyperspace]] directly above Hoth. The Alliance detected their arrival immediately, but the tactic did not shock them as Ozzel had planned, for the presence of the probe droid had made them suspect that the Empire had discovered their base. Before Death Squadron could initiate an [[orbital bombardment]], the Rebels activated the base's [[Deflector shield|shield]], which was powerful enough to deflect any [[laser]] barrage unleashed by the Imperial warships; even the full firepower of the ''Executor'' wouldn't be able to breach it.<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\n[[File:YouAreInCommandNow-SoH.png|thumb|left|250px|Vader personally saw to it that Ozzel's tactical blunder at Hoth was his last mistake.]]\nGeneral Veers reported this development to Vader, who voiced his disapproval at the admiral's tactical blunder as they would now be forced to deploy [[troop]]s and equipment into a costly ground battle rather than simply annihilate the Rebels with a simple orbital bombardment from the fleet. The [[Sith]] Lord opened a [[Viewscreen|channel]] to Ozzel on the ''Executor''{{'s}} bridge and, before an oblivious Ozzel could report on the situation, began telekinetically strangling the admiral in full view of Captain Piett and others. Citing the tactical decision as Ozzel's final failure, Vader executed the pompous and inept officer while simultaneously ordering a blockade around Hoth and promoting Piett to take his place as admiral, bestowing the title at the exact moment Ozzel's still-twitching corpse hit the floor.<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\nAs he died, Ozzel thought back on his life, coming to the realization that he had willingly given over his entire life to authoritarians. He regretted his choices and wished he had been a rebel spy and shared a life with his fianc\u00e9e. His last thoughts were remembering a memory from his childhood, one of him running up a mountain to come home for dinner.<ref name=\"Kendal\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|And if we made a complaint about Admiral Ozzel's death, sir?''\"<br />\"''I think we both know what would happen, Commander.|Tian Karmiya and Canonhaus|The Final Order}}\nThe Empire went on to win the [[Battle of Hoth]] despite Ozzel's actions.<ref name=\"ESB\" /> While the battle was considered to be the Alliance's worst defeat, it wasn't a crushing one. Ozzel had inadvertently given time to the rebels to evacuate when he brought the fleet out of hyperspace too close to Hoth. [[Historian]]s of the [[Galactic Civil War]] concluded that if it hadn't been for their defeat on Hoth, the Rebel Alliance may not have risked everything the [[4 ABY|following year]] in the decisive [[Battle of Endor]].<ref name=\"Complete Locations\">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of lightspeed, and we're preparing to&hellip;''\"<br />\"''You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.|Ozzel reports to Vader, mere moments before his execution|audio=YouHaveFailedMeForTheLastTimeAdmiral.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}\nStanding 1.75 [[meter]]s tall, Admiral Kendal Ozzel was a smug and arrogant man who fancied himself the obvious choice to command the ''Executor''.
