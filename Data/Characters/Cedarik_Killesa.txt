He sent his troops against House Thul on multiple fronts as a diversionary tactic, a ruse which [[Jorad Sindarus Thul]] fell for. While House Thul's forces were spread thin, Killesa led a sizeable force through the siege tunnel that connected the lands of House Thul and [[House Killesa]], a remnant from a more peaceful time. With information gathered on the battlefield, an Imperial allied individual took a set of [[Thermite/Legends|thermite]] charges to collapse the tunnel before it was too late.<ref name=\"Traitor\" />\n\nWhen confronted, Killesa was furious at the Empire's involvement, which he saw as House Thul's weakness, as well as [[Treason/Legends|treason]]. Even so, he demanded that the individual engage him in an honorable duel instead of detonating the thermite. The spacer refused and detonated the explosives, killing Killesa and his men.<ref name=\"Traitor\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nCedarik Killesa is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' released by [[BioWare]] in [[2011]].
