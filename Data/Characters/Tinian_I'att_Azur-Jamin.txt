Her grandparents, [[Strephan I'att|Strephan]] and [[Augusta I'att]], as well as her protector, the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] [[Wrrlevgebev]] were [[Death/Legends|killed]] by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]] following a demonstration of the newly-developed [[Anti-energy field|armor-protective field]] for [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Eisen Kerioth]]. Daye helped her escape, but the two were separated and she believed that he was killed. From that point on, she pledged her life to bringing down the Empire and was willing to risk her life, believing that when she died she would be reunited with Daye once more.<ref name=\"TOT\" />\n\n===Bounty hunter===\nAfter escaping Druckenwell, she was picked up by [[Chenlambec]], a Wookiee [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], and the two became friends. She was appointed his Hunt-apprentice. Though small and not physically strong, Tinian's life at I'att Armaments meant that she was very knowledgeable about various forms of weaponry, explosives, and armor. She was also fluent in [[Shyriiwook/Legends|Shyriiwook]] and served as Chenlambec's translator. She stayed with him for three [[Standard year/Legends|years]] before the events surrounding [[Bossk/Legends|Bossk]] and [[Lomabu III]], becoming a skilled resistance fighter and Hunter herself.\n\nShortly after the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]], the two made a plan to capture Bossk, a [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], for desperately needed [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], and at the same time save a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] colony of Wookiees on Lomabu III from Imperials. Tinian's life at her family's armament factory saved both her and Chenlambec, when she was able to sniff out foreign explosives aboard the ship she was using to save the Wookiee colony. She and Chenlambec managed to capture Bossk and were awarded roughly 37,000 credits. They also took the [[Hound's Tooth/Legends|''Hound's Tooth'']], Bossk's ship,<ref name=\"TPP:TTB\">''[[The Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk]]''</ref> though sometime thereafter, Bossk managed to escape from his captivity and steal the ''Hound's Tooth'' back from the two of them.<ref name=\"HM\">''[[Hard Merchandise]]''</ref>\n\n===Reunion===\nAfter the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Tinian was reunited with Daye. They married and had a son, [[Tam Azur-Jamin|Tam]]. During the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Tinian helped the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] scout out incoming [[Yuuzhan Vong]] forces, working with Daye and the Wookiee [[Lowbacca]] in [[Hutt Space/Legends|Hutt Space]]. Shortly after the [[Battle of Fondor (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Fondor]], the invaders thrust towards [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] and [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], and Daye was captured on Nal Hutta. Although Tinian and Lowie escaped successfully back into the New Republic, Daye was only eventually rescued after the end of the conflict.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Tin-dress.jpg|thumb|150px|Tinian attempts to evade Imperial stormtroopers by masquerading as [[Twilit Hearth]].]]\n[[Kathy Tyers]] based Tinian on Lady Firebird, protagonist of her first novel, ''Firebird''. The character's name, \"Tinian,\" comes from ''Tine \u00e9an'', Gaelic for \"fire\" and \"bird,\" respectively.
