He was also a close friend of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Jool]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Ho, ho, ho! The legendary Admiral Stazi vouching for the pirate? The galaxy has gone mad. Done. Vedo out.|Vedo Anjiliac Atirue after Gar Stazi vouched for Cade Skywalker.|Legacy\u2014War 2}}\nFollowing the death of Azzim in the [[Devastation of Da Soocha|devastation]] of [[Da Soocha]] and [[Napdu]] by the [[One Sith]], Vedo wanted revenge. [[Jool]] spoke highly of a pirate named [[Cade Skywalker]] who could get the job Vedo had in mind done, and he asked her to contact him. Arriving on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]] with [[Wolf Sazen]], [[Jariah Syn]], and [[Deliah Blue]], Skywalker and his friends preceded to [[Vedo Anjiliac Atirue's headquarters|Vedo's headquarters]], where they found [[Naxy Screeger]] working as Vedo's gatekeeper. Screeger reminded Skywalker that he owed him for telling him that Sith scientist [[Vul Isen]] was on [[Daluuj/Legends|Daluuj]]. However, Skywalker refused to pay him as the information was false, before moving in to see Vedo, reminding him that they were invited. Screeger wasn't bothered, and decided to let Skywalker pass, before correcting that only ''he'' was invited and causing a door to fall from the ceiling, cutting off Cade from his companions and disappearing into the ground. Several [[Security droid/Legends|security droids]] then attacked him, but he easily dispatched them with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]].\n\nMoving forward, Skywalker encountered Vedo, who apologized for the trap, stating that he needed to test if Cade was really as good as was claimed. Jool also apologized, stating that she perhaps spoke of him ''too'' highly. Vedo then made an offer to Skywalker to kill Vul Isen, who created the [[Viral spore|toxin]] used to purge [[Dac]] and Da Soocha of all life. Vedo laid a trap for Isen, using [[Galactic Alliance Remnant]] [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gar Stazi]] as bait. Forwarding Stazi's whereabouts on [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]] to the [[Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire|Galactic Empire]], Vedo knew that Isen would come to not only kill Stazi, but to purge Utapau of all life and the many Alliance personnel taking refuge there. Skywalker asked Vedo as to why he was being hired, since he was hunting Isen already. The Anjiliac responded that he would become a Hutt agent, and the enemy would die by the Hutts' hand. As Utapau and the Alliance were already at risk, Skywalker could see no other risks. If he failed, the Sith would win, and would become a much larger threat than any resulting Hutt anger. He accepted, and Vedo informed Skywalker that a [[Bothan/Legends|Bothan]] agent named [[Pobos]] would meet him there. Although Pobos was killed by a Sith [[Assassin/Legends|assassin]], Skywalker ultimately succeeded in killing Isen and prevented him from releasing his plague on the planet.\n\nVedo along with other Hutts presented bounties for those who could kill Sith and collect their lightsabers. Vedo again employed Cade to kill more Sith as a way to contribute to the war, but not be officially in it. When Cade destroyed a Star Destroyer but had no lightsabers to prove it, Vedo questioned the loyalty and honesty of a pirate, but Gar Stazi vouched for Skywalker as Rogue Squadron was present when Skywalker destroyed the Imperial warship.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Legacy (2006) 48|''Legacy'' (2006) 48]] {{1stm}}\n*[[Legacy (2006) 49|''Legacy'' (2006) 49]] {{1st}}\n*''[[Legacy\u2014War 2]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Vedo Anjiliac Atirue\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anjiliac Atirue, Vedo}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Hutt Council]]\n[[Category:Hutts of the Anjiliac clan]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nal Hutta residents]]"}}}]}}}}
