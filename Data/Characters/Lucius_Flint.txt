When the impending [[Supernova/Legends|supernova]] in the [[Demophon system]] was announced, Flint compromised his principles and allied with the [[G'uotr Network]]. His reasons were not selfish, but rather to ensure his wife and children would be able to escape the planet. He also reasoned that the Network was getting more people off the planet than the DCP, and that was worth overlooking minor infractions. He refused to take part in any major crimes, however, which kept the Network from trusting him completely.<ref name=\"TC\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{WEGCite|book=Supernova (WEG)|text=''Supernova''|story=Triple Cross}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flint, Lucius}}\n[[Category:Demophonians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Police]]"}}}]}}}}
