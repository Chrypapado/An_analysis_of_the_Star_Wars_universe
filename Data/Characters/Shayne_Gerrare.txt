He lived alone and had included important security devices in his [[Gerrare household|house]].\n\nShayne decided to join the [[Cularin resistance]], and he might have had contacts in the [[Hiironi irstat]] who could provide the resistance with the location of a valid headquarters. Somehow, the [[Metatheran Cartel]] got wind of the resistance and Gerrare's plans to join them, as they tried to take him before he could. He was saved by a resistance force that caught them in the act. The battle left scorch marks on his house's front door.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Resistance Within]]'' {{1stm}}\n*''[[Twi'light Storm]]'' {{Mo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gerrare, Shayne}}\n[[Category:Cereans]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Resistance fighters]]"}}}]}}}}
