Things have gotten pretty stale around here lately.|Gerlon upon meeting [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Gerlon Two-Fingers''' was a [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] who was at one point considered one of the greatest duelists in the [[Taris/Legends|Taris]] [[Taris dueling ring|dueling ring]].\n\n==Biography==\nGerlon was a veteran duelist in the [[Taris dueling ring]]. He quickly rose through the ranks, gaining more skill every day. After a tragic accident where Gerlon's [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] overheated during a match and exploded and paralyzed three fingers on his right hand, he earned the name Gerlon Two-Fingers. [[Marl]] described this incident as a \"one in a million occurrence\". After the injury, he slowly lost his high standings in the ring, until the only person he was able to beat was [[Deadeye Duncan]], the weakest duelist. Gerlon remained quite bitter about the accident and frequently claimed that he could have beaten most other duelists if he still had his digits.<ref name=\"kotor\" /> [[Ajuur]], the owner of the arena, eventually began using him simply to soften up opponents for later battles.<ref name=\"CSWE\">''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref>\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nIn [[3956 BBY]], [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], under the alias of \"the [[Mysterious Stranger]]\", defeated him in a broadcast duel.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGerlon's first [[canon]]ical appearance is as a non-player character in the ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' [[video game]]. Inside the game, the player, Revan, can choose to fight him in the dueling ring. However, the nature of the encounter is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the player's alignment. Therefore, it is undetermined whether Revan ever interacted with him.<ref name=\"kotor\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{C|Mentioned only&mdash;weapon name}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Gerlon\n|es=Gerlon Dos Dedos\n|nl=Gerlon Two-Fingers\n|pl=Gerlon Dwa Palce\n|ru=\u0414\u0432\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043b\u043e\u043d\n}}\n\n[[Category:Aliases, nicknames, and pseudonyms|Two-Fingers, Gerlon]]\n[[Category:Duelists|Two-Fingers, Gerlon]]\n[[Category:Humans|Two-Fingers, Gerlon]]\n[[Category:Males|Two-Fingers, Gerlon]]\n[[Category:Tarisians|Two-Fingers, Gerlon]]"}}}]}}}}
