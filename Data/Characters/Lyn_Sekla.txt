This is my shot at the big time. I can't risk screwing it up by talking to you.|Lyn to [[Revan/Legends|Revan]]|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}}\n'''Lyn Sekla''' was a [[Gender/Legends|female]] yellow [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] who wanted desperately to get off [[Taris/Legends|Taris]]. In [[3956 BBY]], she heard that [[Bib Surool]] of the [[Starlight Entertainers]] was stuck on Taris due to the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] quarantine, and auditioned for him as a dancer. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] ensured her that he could be a good partner for her audition, and helped her to be hired.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the player's persuade skill is high enough, then they can persuade her to be her partner. If the player succeeds then she is hired; however, the player can also purposely ruin the audition by running around her in circles or falling down.\n\nThere are 3 dances, each with 3 choices:\n\nSafe: Revan is careful, dancing off a bit to the side. This always works, and Lyn is guaranteed a job.\n\nBold: Revan dances close to Lyn, be it to the side, in front or behind. Success of each dance is 50-50.\n\nRuin: Revan spoils Lyn's chance, like her last 2 partners.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Lyn Sekla\n|es=Lyn Sekla\n|pl=Lyn Sekla\n|fi=Lyn Sekla\n|ru=\u041b\u0438\u043d \u0421\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sekla, Lyn}}\n[[Category:Dancers]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Tarisians]]\n[[Category:Twi'leks]]"}}}]}}}}
