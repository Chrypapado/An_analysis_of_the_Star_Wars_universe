Her brother-in-law was [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel/Legends|Soontir Fel]], and she lived on the [[Fel estate|estate]] Soontir had gained through his barony. Nearly [[5 ABY/Legends|five years]] after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], her son Fyric was kidnapped by [[Ilir Post]] as part of an [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]]-backed plot to force the Fels to reveal the location of [[Syal Antilles Fel|Wynssa Starflare]], Soontir Fel's wife, as Soontir had defected to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. Rather than betray her family, Fel and her husband used the [[Corellian Security Force]] investigators assigned to the kidnapping case and three [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] sent by [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]], Starflare's brother, to expose Post so that Todr could kill him and rescue Fyric. They accepted the Rogues' offer to join Soontir in the New Republic, where their family would be safer.\n\n==Biography==\n===One of the Fels===\n{{Quote|It's the Fels. They take care of their own.

She became part of the [[Fel dynasty|Fel family]], which was defined by deep loyalty to each other and a sense of duty. Around late [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], she gave birth to their son, [[Fyric Fel|Fyric]].<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], the Fels moved into far more luxurious conditions when Soontir, who had achieved great fame as an Imperial [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], was made a [[Baron of the Empire/Legends|Baron of the Empire]] and given a massive [[Fel estate|estate]] on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]].

Your wife set us up.|Wes Janson, to Todr Fel|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties}}\nAround ten months after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], Fyric was [[Mission to Corellia (Rogue Squadron)|kidnapped]] from the estate. The Fels were given a notice to meet the kidnappers at an alley rendezvous, but resolved to resist. They understood that it was an attempt by [[Imperial Intelligence/Legends|Imperial Intelligence]] to pressure them into disclosing Starflare's location, and would not turn on a family member. [[Corellian Security Force]] investigators [[Corran Horn]] and [[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]] were sent to investigate and began inspecting the estate and interviewing the Fels. Later that day, three strangers came by the estate, claiming to be friends. Before Horn turned them away, Todr was able to deduce that they had been sent by Wedge Antilles, and got the location of their [[Hangar/Legends|docking bay]].<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n[[File:Fels-leaving.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fel and her family leaving for the New Republic]]\nThe Fels concocted a ploy to find the kidnappers and rescue Fyric. Fel took a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] of her son, with a tracking device embedded, and went to see the three New Republic pilots. She claimed that the rest of the family refused to betray Starflare to help Fyric. She demanded that they rescue her son, and offered to give up Starflare's location for her. They were uneasy with her willingness to turn over Starflare, but as Fel knew that she would be safe in the New Republic, she did not see an issue. They agreed, and Fel gave the three&mdash;[[Isplourrdacartha Estillo]], [[Wes Janson/Legends|Wes Janson]], and [[Derek Klivian/Legends|Derek Klivian]]&mdash;the location of the meeting that the kidnappers had set up.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\nIn the meeting, the New Republic pilots passed the hologram to [[Ilir Post]], the leader of the Imperial Intelligence-backed kidnappers. Todr used the tracking signal to trace Post to his hideout, and when the New Republic pilots, working with Horn and Wessiri, stormed it and drew out Post, Todr shot him and retrieved Fyric. The [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]] pilots offered all the Fels safe haven in the New Republic, to which Soontir had defected, and Todr came back to the Fel estate to consider it. Fel and her husband decided to take Fyric to safety in the New Republic, and packed up to leave with the Rogues. Their [[Starship/Legends|starship]] came under attack by [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] hired by Imperial Intelligence, but timely intervention by Horn allowed the group to leave the [[Corellian system|system]] safely.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Ajai-dejected.jpg|thumb|right|Fel after her son's kidnapping]]\n{{Quote|That Ajai was really cold.''\"<br />\"''Having your child kidnapped does little for your charm.|Derek Klivian and Isplourrdacartha Estillo|Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Family Ties}}\nAjai Fel was extremely loyal to the rest of the Fels, and was willing to take great risks for them, as when she participated in the dangerous plot to rescue Fyric without giving up her sister-in-law. She remained collected and able to carry out the plan despite her worry over her missing son. Fel was able to convincingly deceive the pilots of Rogue Squadron into believing her a distraught mother when in fact she was manipulating them into aiding her, suggesting she had some talent at dissembling as well.<ref name=\"Family Ties\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe character of Ajai Fel was created by [[Michael A.
