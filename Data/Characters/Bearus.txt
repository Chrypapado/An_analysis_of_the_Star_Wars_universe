He obtained a position within the system's [[Carbonite Guild]], an influential [[Mining/Legends|mining]] conglomerate that worked in close correspondence with the [[Tetan Monarchy]]. Bearus eventually rose to the title of guild [[Chairman/Legends|chairman]], and under his leadership, the guild saw great success with the production of [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]], a [[Mining/Legends|mined]] [[Ore/Legends|ore]] that was an integral component in the manufacture of [[Starship/Legends|starship]] parts,<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" /> most notably [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]] engines. By [[3997 BBY]], the guild's profit margin had risen by fifteen percent under the leadership of Bearus, which in turn provided a significant boost to the already flourishing Tetan economy.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\nBearus operated from a [[Tetan carbonite smelter|carbonite smelter]] [[Space station/Legends|space station]] that [[Orbit/Legends|orbited]] the system's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Empress Teta/Legends|Empress Teta]]. The [[Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] and Empress of the Tetan worlds, [[Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Keto]] and his sister [[Magda Keto|Magda]], conducted annual inspections of Bearus' smelter station and its production progress. During the inspection of 3997 BBY, the Ketos arrived as scheduled, and Bearus escorted them through his facility. In the midst of the tour, Bearus was made aware that the children of the Ketos, [[Aleema Keto|Aleema]] and her cousin [[Satal Keto/Legends|Satal]], were en route to the station. The chairman was reluctant to grant them permission to enter at first, knowing that their presence was a breach of protocol, and that only sanctioned officials were allowed to attend such important matters of state. However, he allowed for their entry onto the station, believing that their arrival would not detract from Lord Keto's inspection.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" />\n\n===Krath takeover===\n{{Quote|This is a violation of guild protocols!

However, when Lord Keto learned of Bearus' decision to admit Aleema and Satal on board the smelter, he chastised the guild chairman for his insubordination. Bearus offered to have the children sent away, but Lord Keto relented, and instead blamed their [[Korus|royal tutor]] for the mishap.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" /> Aleema and Satal arrived at that moment, declaring themselves and their new [[Krath/Legends|Krath]] [[Sith cult/Legends|Sith cult]] the new governing body of the Empress Teta system, and proceeded to subdue the present Tetan officials. Lord Keto ordered Bearus to summon the authorities and have Aleema and Satal taken into custody, but when the chairman reached for a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]], Aleema used [[Sith magic]] to transform it into a monster, and it attacked Bearus.<ref name=\"DLOTS1\" />\n\nWith the Krath's violent [[Political uprising of the Empress Teta system|coup]] underway, Bearus was among the Tetan officials with Lord and Lady Keto who were ordered by Aleema and Satal into the adjacent carbonite smelting chamber.

His administrative skills and leadership abilities were instrumental in the success of Tetan carbonite production, as favorably remarked by Lord Keto. Bearus appeared humble in the Emperor's presence, and attributed the station's success to supply and demand rather than his management skills. Nonetheless, he was proud of his accomplishments. An obedient member of Keto's bureaucracy, Bearus nevertheless went against policy when he granted permission for Aleema and Satal to board his carbonite facility. His insubordination would ultimately result in his death and the deaths of all those present.<ref name=\"DLOTSA\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBearus first appeared in the first installment of the [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi|''Tales of the Jedi'']] [[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith|''Dark Lords of the Sith'']] story arc, [[Tales of the Jedi &ndash; Dark Lords of the Sith 1|''Masters and Students of the Force'']], written by authors [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Kevin J.
