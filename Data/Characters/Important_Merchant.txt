He sold various supplies at a stand, being a great asset to [[Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends|Qui-Gon Jinn]] during his stay at Tatooine. He was also repairing a [[Titan 2150 rocket engine|Titan 2150]] [[Podracer/Legends|podracer]] in the back of his shop, which he intended to sell for use in the [[Boonta Eve Classic/Legends|Boonta Eve Classic]].\n\nAt his shop, he was willing to sell any of his items, but only for the right price. He was eventually approached by Qui-Gon Jinn, who needed parts to repair [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker's]] [[Anakin Skywalker's Podracer/Legends|podracer]]. He turned to the Important Merchant, who had a [[Mass coupler]], one of the parts needed to fix the podracer, but he was cautious to deal with Jinn after hearing that he only carried [[Galactic Credit Standard|Republic credits]]. Qui-Gon offered a trade, but he wasn't interested in anything the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] was carrying. Upon being prompted, though, he stated that he would accept two [[Fuel converter]]s, or a Fusion coil and an [[Engine binder]] for the Mass coupler. They reached an agreement, and Jinn obtained the Mass coupler for Anakin.\n\nThe Important Merchant's podracer was eventually sold to [[Ratts Tyerell/Legends|Ratts Tyerell]], who raced with it in the Boonta Eve Classic, but was killed after crashing it on the second lap.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe Important Merchant made his first and only appearance in the [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]] in the Mos Espa level, where he is voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]. He shares the same character model with [[Anabar]] and various other Tatooinians. In the mission, the player, in the guise of Jinn, must acquire parts to repair Skywalker's podracer by completing several side-quests.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (video game)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' video game]] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]]''\n\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Merchants]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
