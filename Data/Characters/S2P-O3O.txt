Generally called '''OhThreeOh''', the droid was basically a rolling computer with arms. He had a boxlike body with two arms, equipped with tool mounts, extending from the front of it. He had visual sensors on both the front and back. Programmed for biological research, he collected samples and ran tests in situations dangerous for organics.\n\nOhThreeOh was often around the researchers, but did not actually interact with them much. His non-humanoid appearance made it easy for the researchers to think of him as a machine. He didn't have a visible mouth, his voice emerging from somewhere inside his body. Unknown to even himself, he was an [[espionage droid]]. He recorded what happened around him and periodically broadcast it out towards [[Genarius]].\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n[[Category:Almas residents]]\n[[Category:Analysis droids]]\n[[Category:Biologists]]\n[[Category:Espionage droids]]"}}}]}}}}
