The Jedi Knight? Why didn't you say so in the first place, sir? I would have pulled some strings.|Cole Fardreamer|The New Rebellion}}\n'''Cole Fardreamer''' was a [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] mechanic from [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe aspired to become a great hero of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] like [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]]. When Cole was on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] Skywalker was known to be the best land speeder racer in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]]. But this dream was lost when he found out on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] that Skywalker's successes were most likely due to his abilities with [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. So he stayed on Coruscant as a mechanic for the New Republic fleet.\n\nHe was best known for discovering a flaw in the upgraded [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]] computers, [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] ordered in [[17 ABY/Legends|17 ABY]], which involved bombs that were activated when the X-Wings activated, and for his role in helping the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] foil the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] [[Kueller]]'s plot to overthrow the New Republic. He took the droids to [[Telti/Legends|Telti]] where he was captured and tortured by [[Brakiss]]. He was rescued when R2-D2 led a rebellion of junked droids.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The New Rebellion]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*{{FFCite|93|ALM3-4, ''The Almania Crisis''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Cole Fardreamer\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fardreamer, Cole}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
