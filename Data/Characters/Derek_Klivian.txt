He attended the [[Skystrike Academy]] with [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Rake Gahree]]. He and Antilles [[Escape from Skystrike Academy|defected]] to the rebellion after making contact with [[Sabine Wren]]. After the [[Battle of Yavin]], [[Luke Skywalker]] invited Klivian to join [[Rogue Squadron]]. Klivian accepted and served the unit with distinction during the [[Battle of Hoth]] where he [[Death|sacrificed himself]] by crashing his [[T-47 airspeeder]] into [[Maximilian Veers|Maximilian Veers']]s [[All Terrain Armored Transport]], [[Blizzard 1]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nDerek Klivian [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the [[planet]] [[Ralltiir]]<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\" /> and, since the [[time]] of his [[Youngling|childhood]], was a gifted [[pilot]]. At some point in his childhood he gained the nickname of \"Hobbie.\" Throughout his life, he introduced himself as Hobbie, asking people to address him by his nickname and saying that he hated the name Derek.<ref name=\"OTFL\" />\n\n====Skystrike Academy====\n{{Quote|We made our choice.|Derek Klivian to Sabine Wren|The Antilles Extraction}}\nKlivian honed his piloting skills [[Skystrike Academy]],<ref name=\"OTFL\" /> an elite [[Imperial Academy|flight academy]] on the planet [[Montross]], training under [[Flight instructor|Instructor]] [[Goran]].<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" /> He trained others in [[asteroid]] running and no-instrument navigation.<ref name=\"OTFL\" /> One day Klivian met fellow pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] while playing several hands of Sabacc at their baracks.<ref name=\"FACPOV\">{{Shortstory|story=Rendezvous Point (short story)|sformatted=Rendezvous Point|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> [[Gender|He]] also met [[Rake Gahree]].<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" /> However, Klivian, along with many of his peers, eventually wanted to contact the growing rebellion against the Empire and use his skills to fight.<ref name=\"OTFL\" />\n\nAntilles and Gahree were also discontent with the direction they felt the Empire was taking and made plans to defect to the rebellion. This information eventually made its way to one of the many [[Fulcrum]] [[agent]]s,<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" /> who became the link Klivian needed.<ref name=\"OTFL\" /> Fulcrum passed the information to the [[Phoenix Cell]].<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\n[[File:Hobbie-Klivian.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Derek Klivian and Wedge Antilles imprisoned in Skystrike Academy]]\nThe information also caught the attention of the [[Imperial Security Bureau]], which dispatched [[Lothal sector]]'s [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] as well as agent [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] to investigate the claims. Hobbie, Antilles and Gahree argued that they knew about their planned defection. However, fellow [[Imperial cadet|cadet]] Ria Talla, secretly undercover [[Spectres|rebel]] [[Sabine Wren]], overheard and told Antilles that she would help them defect.<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\nLater, Hobbie and his friends found an opportunity to escape when Goran ordered the [[cadet]]s to take part in a mock combat exercise in [[Realspace|space]]. Sabine arranged for her rebel comrades [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Kanan Jarrus]] to rendezvous their [[CR90 corvette]] near the planet. At Sabine's signal, Hobbie and his comrades flew towards the rebel [[corvette]]. However, Pryce deactivated the [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIEs']] [[solar collector]] panels, leaving them derelict in space. Pryce also ordered [[Captain]] [[Vult Skerris]] to shoot one of the TIE pods as a warning; [[Death|claiming]] the life of Rake. Hobbie, Sabine and Wedge were soon arrested by [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] forces.<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\nFollowing their capture, Wedge and Hobbie were thrown into a holding cell by Kallus. Inside the two debated their escape plans with Wedge suggesting they surprise the guards. A demoralized Hobbie was dubious of their chances of success due to the lack of an escape plan. Fortunately for them, they were rescued by Sabine, who had managed to knock out Governor Pryce. The defectors and Sabine then fled down a corridor only to run into Agent Kallus. However, the ISB agent had a change of heart due to his previous encounter with Sabine's rebel cell and allowed them to escape.<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\n[[File:The_Antilles_Extraction_thumb.png|250px|right|Cadet Hobbie with Wedge Antilles and Sabine Wren|thumb|right]]\nHeading to [[Hangar]] 24, Hobbie and his friends [[Escape from Skystrike Academy|fled]] on a [[TIE/sa bomber|TIE bomber]]. They managed to flee into the atmosphere but were pursued by Captain Skerris. At the eleventh [[Standard hour|hour]], they were rescued by Ezra's CR90 corvette and managed to flee aboard. Hobbie, Wedge, and their rebel rescuers then traveled to the Phoenix [[Chopper Base|base]] on [[Atollon]]. There, Wedge and Hobbie were greeted by [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]] who formally welcomed them into the rebellion.<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" /> Eventually, the two distinguished themselves in their early engagements.<ref name=\"OTFL\" />\n\n===Serving in Phoenix Cell===\n====Training exercise====\n{{Quote|Hobbie, Wedge, let's go! Move it!|Hera Syndulla, to Wedge and Hobbie|Warhead (episode)}}\n[[File:Hobbie_Wedge_Warhead.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hobbie and Wedge prepare for a training mission]]\nA short while after his defection from the Empire, Hobbie, along with the rest of the Spectres and Phoenix Squadron were to take part in a training exercise. Shortly before they left, Hobbie and Wedge were conversing in the hanger despite the fact that they were behind schedule. They suddenly heard Hera Syndulla call for them, and in the shock to get ready, the two ran straight into each other. In their absence after they left, Chopper Base was [[EXD-9's infiltration of Chopper Base|infiltrated]] by the [[E-XD-series infiltrator droid]] [[EXD-9]], who was searching the [[Outer Rim Territories]] for rebel bases. The [[Lasat]] [[Garazeb Orrelios]], the inventory droid [[AP-5]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] managed to capture and reprogram the droid as an improvised rigged bomb which destroyed an [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]].<ref name=\"Warhead\" />\n\n===Alliance to Restore the Republic===\n====Atollon====\n{{Quote|Hobbie, follow me.|Wedge signals Hobbie during the dogfight|Zero Hour}}\n[[File:DerekKlivianRZ1Awing-SWZ83.png|thumb|right|250px|Klivian flew as part of Phoenix Squadron during the Battle of Atollon.]]\nEventually, all of the individual rebel cells grouped together to reorganize into the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]].<ref name=\"Secret Cargo\">{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}</ref> Just as Phoenix Squadron had been preparing to make an attack on the Imperial factory on Lothal, the Chiss [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] managed to discover the location of Chopper Base, and subsequently launched an all-out attack in an attempt to finally thwart out their rebel actives, which had become a legitimate threat to the Empire. During the ground assault, Hobbie, Wedge and two other rebel pilots launched their [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing starfighters]] in order to counter the [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] that had been stationed on the planet's surface. With Wedge signalling Hobbie to follow him, the duo attempted to attack the walkers; however, Thrawn quickly took note of their excursion, and dispatched TIE fighters to repel them. The A-wings and the TIE-fighters consequently engaged in a dogfight. Towards the latter part of the battle, the two managed to escape, along with the remnants of Phoenix Squadron and [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group]] to [[Yavin 4]].<ref name=\"Zero Hour\">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>\n\n====''Rand Ecliptic'' mutiny====\n[[File:Biggs.png|thumb|left|200px|Biggs Darklighter, the Imperial cadet whom Hobbie assisted to defect]]\nAround this time, Klivian went undercover<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars NE\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''</ref> and attended the [[Prefsbelt Fleet Camp]]<ref name=\"SWCT\">{{SWCT|Hobbie Klivian - Snowspeeder Gunner - Base Series 1|Hobbie Klivian - Snowspeeder Gunner - ''Base Series 1''}}</ref> with [[Biggs Darklighter]].

During the [[Battle of Scarif|mission]] to steal the [[Death Star plans|technical readouts]] of the secret [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]], he served as the standby for [[Red Six]], although the position was ultimately filled by [[Jek Tono Porkins]].<ref name=\"UVG\" /> Klivian tried to comfort his friend Wedge after he'd been left off the duty roster for the battle.<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\n====Yavin====\nDays later, it was Klivian's turn to be comforted by Wedge, after learning that he would not be participating in the [[Battle of Yavin]].<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\n====Mako-Ta====\n{{Quote|I hope this isn't weird but&hellip;I just wanted to say I'm honored to meet you, sir.|Derek Klivian, to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars (2015) 45}}\nMonths later, he and Antilles took part in a training run sponsored by Syndulla. There they met [[Zev Senesca]]. The trio became friends based on the meeting. As the rebellion recovered and gathered their forces at [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]], the pilots met up with Red Squadron and would-be Jedi [[Luke Skywalker]] in [[Mess Hall IV]].<ref name=\"SW 45\">[[Star Wars (2015) 45|''Star Wars'' (2015) 45]]</ref> Shortly after, the [[Galactic Empire]] launched an [[Assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks|assault]] on the Alliance's base.

Thanks to [[Han Solo]], the Rebel starfighters were eventually able to launch into battle, with Klivian, serving as a member of [[Rogue Squadron]], an adhoc unit formed by Skywalker during the battle in honor of the actions of [[Jyn Erso]].<ref name=\"Battles that Changed the Galaxy\">''[[Star Wars: Battles that Changed the Galaxy]]''</ref>\n\n====Hoth====\n[[File:HobbieESB.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Klivian preparing his snowspeeder for the battle.]]\nAfter the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], Skywalker invited Klivian to join Rogue Squadron. Klivian joined,<ref name=\"SWCT\" /> and he and Antilles became core members of the elite group.<ref name=\"OTFL\" /> Klivian and Antilles flew together at multiple engagements, including the [[Battle of Distilon]], the [[Battle of Perimako Major]], and at least a dozen other worlds.<ref name=\"FACPOV\" />\n\nThe Rebel Alliance eventually came to be stationed at [[Echo Base]] on the planet [[Hoth]]. After the rebel presence on the planet was discovered by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader's]] [[Death Squadron]], Hobbie and other [[starfighter]] [[Rebel pilot|pilots]] attended a briefing by [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] prior to the impending [[Battle of Hoth]]. Klivian and Rogue Squadron would fly [[T-47 airspeeder|T-47 snowspeeders]],<ref name=\"ESB\" /> with the squadron's [[X-wing starfighter]]s kept in reserve to escape Hoth,<ref name=\"OTFL\" /> to delay the landing [[Imperial Army|Imperial ground]] [[Imperial Military|forces]] while the rest of the station evacuated. Once this task was completed, the pilots would escort each individual [[transport]] away from the base, past the Imperial [[blockade]]. Skeptical that two fighters would be able to fight their way past an Imperial Star Destroyer, Organa nevertheless assured him that the base's [[V-150 Planet Defender|v-150]] [[ion cannon]] would provide enough cover for the escape.<ref name=\"ESB\" />\n\n[[File:Walker_Assault_DICE.png|thumb|left|220px|Hobbie and Rogue Squadron flew T-47 airspeeders against the Imperial ground assault]]\nDuring the battle against the Empire's AT-AT [[walker]]s, Hobbie served as Skywalker's wingman,<ref name=\"ESB\" /> and he remained in the air for longer than the majority of rebel pilots. In addition to a high casualty rate, however, the rebels also lost their base's [[deflector shield generator]] to General [[Maximilian Veers|Maximilian Veers']]s walker, [[Blizzard 1]]. After a hit crippled his snowspeeder, Hobbie did not eject from his ship and instead crashed it into the head of Blizzard 1. With the walker now decapitated, Hobbie's maneuver had saved numerous rebels from its cannons and blunted the Imperial advance.<ref name=\"OTFL\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n[[File:Klivian_helmet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Derek Klivian's first [[K-22995 light flight helmet|flight helmet]]]]\nKlivian was a [[human]] male who stood 1.75 [[meter]]s tall.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> While he was initially under the Galactic Empire as part of Skystrike Academy, Klivian and many others were discontent with the regime. Thanks to agent Fulcrum, he quickly joined the rebel [[Starfighter Corps]], ultimately serving as an X-wing [[starfighter]] jockey.<ref name=\"OTFL\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nA pilot since childhood, Hobbie was a skilled enough to be in Rogue Group, a unit of X-wing aces in the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]].<ref name=\"OTFL\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDerek Klivian was portrayed by [[Richard Oldfield]] in [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], in which he was credited only as \"Hobbie (Rogue 4).\u201d Hobbie appears as an Imperial cadet in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', voiced by [[Trevor Devall]].{{Fact}}\n\n[[File:Hobbie_cut_scene_TMOTESB.jpg|250px|thumb|Footage of Hobbie's scene cut from ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]\nKlivian was originally scripted to die in The Empire Strikes Back by crashing his T-47 airspeeder into the \"head\" of Blizzard 1, the All Terrain Armored Transport leading the assault on Echo Base. The scene was never finished, and thus never put in the final film. Preliminary footage of the unfinished scene was later released as part of the enhanced edition of ''[[The Making of The Empire Strikes Back]]'' book.<ref name=\"Making of TESB\">''[[The Making of The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref> Sources like the [[Databank (website)|Databank]] on [[StarWars.com]] or the [[Star Wars: Card Trader|''Star Wars'': Card Trader]] say that Klivian managed to eject from the cockpit of his snowspeeder before it could crash, though the reference book ''[[Star Wars: On the Front Lines]]'' later contradicted that by saying Klivian died during the Battle of Hoth. The author [[Daniel Wallace]], in an interview with Eleven Thirty-Eight, clarified that the [[Lucasfilm Story Group]] pointed him to the planned scene, so he could incorporate it in the book. He also speculated that the planned scene took precedence before [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]], where Klivian survived the battle and lived long after.<ref name=\"11 38\">{{Cite_web|url=http://eleven-thirtyeight.com/2017/07/on-the-front-lines-an-interview-with-dan-wallace|title=On The Front Lines \u2013 An Interview with Dan Wallace|author=Nicholas W.
