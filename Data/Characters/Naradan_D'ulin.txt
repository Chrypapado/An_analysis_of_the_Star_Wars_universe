She worked in the guard of [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Foolookoola]] in [[33 BBY/Legends|33 BBY]], and distrusted [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronians]]. She had black [[Hair/Legends|hair]], and was possibly an ancestor of [[Karoly D'ulin]].\n\n==Biography==\nAfter the coup in the royal house of Ootoola were executed by a group of insurgent Ootoolaner purists, Naradan was able to survive along with [[Foolookoola]] and [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Sabon]]. [[Vilmarh Grahrk]], [[Devaronian/Legends|Devaronian]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] was hired to protect her for her destination. D'Ulin had serious reservations about Grahrk since she doesn't trust his species that much.\n\nWhile operating, Naradan and Vilmarh were found by the purists and taken as prisoners, but they were released after Vilmarh feigned his betrayal and brought them to safety on Dur Sabon. D'Ulin remained after the trip on the side of the [[Prince/Legends|princess]], to protect her further.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Tales|3|Deal with a Demon}} {{1st}}\n*[[Star Wars (1998) 40|''Star Wars'' (1998) 40]] {{Imo}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n[[File:NaradanDulin_kick.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Naradan in action]]\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Naradan D'ulin\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:D'ulin, Naradan}}\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Mistryl]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"}}}]}}}}
