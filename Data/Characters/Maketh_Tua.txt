She entered the ranks of the Empire serving as an assistant [[minister]] to [[Governor]] [[Ryder Azadi]] and, eventually, [[Arihnda Pryce]] when she became the new governor of Lothal on behalf of the Empire.\nIn the absence of Governor Price, Tua was tasked with overseeing Lothal's industries, making certain they all operated at peak efficiency for the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]]. However, after a string of failures to put down a growing [[Spectres|rebellion]] on her homeworld, Lothal was visited by [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the Imperial Governor of the entire [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. He berated her and the other Imperial leaders for their failures, even [[Death|executing]] [[Commandant]] [[Cumberlayne Aresko]] and [[Taskmaster]] [[Myles Grint]] for their incompetence, and took control of the situation himself.\n\nHowever, Tarkin's efforts ultimately resulted in the rebels [[Action at Mustafar|destroying]] his own [[flagship]], the ''[[Sovereign]]'', and the [[death]] of [[the Grand Inquisitor]]. In retribution, Tarkin ordered Tua to locate the rebels. Despite doubling patrols, setting up security checkpoints, and establishing curfews, she was unable to discover the whereabouts of the cell. In response, the [[Darth Sidious|Emperor]] dispatched his chief enforcer and apprentice, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], to deal with the situation. Having failed the Grand Moff, she was summoned to meet with him in person the next day to atone for her failure.\n\nFearing for her life, she contacted the cell and arranged for passage off of Lothal, in exchange for a list of rebel sympathizers provided on Lothal and its neighboring [[Star system|systems]], and information regarding the Empire's true mission on Lothal. Vader, however, suspected she would run, and decided to use her to draw out the rebels and lead the Empire to the larger rebellion. [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]], an [[agent]] of the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] programmed a [[9D9-s54 Dianoga spy droid|spy droid]] to shadow the minister, and then personally escorted her to her [[Sentinel-class landing craft|shuttle]] for her meeting. However, the cell attacked the shuttle that day, and a [[Ezra Bridger|rebel]] ordered Tua to board the ship, telling her that they would be right behind her. As she entered the trooper compartment, the vehicle exploded, killing the minister.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|You're a level five Academy student?

Following Azadi's dismissal and arrest on charges of [[treason]], Tua continued to serve his successor Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]], who ruled Lothal in the name of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. Under Pryce, Tua was appointed as the minister in charge of Lothal's industrial production. A [[Standard year|year]] after Pryce was appointed Governor of Lothal, Tua greeted Governor Pryce when she returned to her homeworld.<ref name=\"Thrawn\">[[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']]</ref>\n\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, Pryce questioned Tua about the 20 percent decline in refinery output over the past four mines. Tua informed her that the mines were being exhausted. She also reported that they were having trouble recruiting [[Mining|miners]] since [[Commandant]] [[Cumberlayne Aresko]] had successfully recruited many young people into the [[Academy for Young Imperials|Lothal Academy]]. Pryce ordered her to recruit foreign miners. Upon learning that the [[doonium]] vein at [[Pryce Mining]] had been exhausted, Pryce ordered Tua to shut down her family's former company immediately. At Pryce's request, Tua arranged a meeting with [[Senator]] [[Domus Renking]].<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nA few months later, Tua met with Governor Pryce to discuss the bidding war between Lothal and [[Kintoni]] to host landing and maintenance facilities for the [[Imperial Navy]]. While Tua was content with the current Imperial Navy presence on Lothal, Pryce reiterated that she wanted their homeworld to be the center of Imperial power and industry in this part of the Outer Rim. Pryce then placed Tua in charge of Lothal while she traveled to [[Coruscant]] to attend to the bidding war between Lothal and Kintoni, which Lothal ultimately won due to Pryce's political savvy.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nAs a minister of Lothal, Tua played a key role in the planet's affiliation with the Empire. One of her initial actions as minister was bringing new government-sponsored housing to Lothal. Those homes were reasonably affordable, and helped the growing population.<ref name=\"HNN\">{{HoloNetNews|post/97314128383/holonet-news-special-report-empire-ensures-new|Special Report: Empire Ensures New Affordable Housing on Lothal|int=HoloNet News Special Report: Empire Ensures New Affordable Housing on Lothal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005000604/http://holonetnews.com/post/97314128383/holonet-news-special-report-empire-ensures-new}}</ref> Later, she attended the going-away party of [[Dhara Leonis]], who had been accepted to the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal, during which the two spoke.<ref name=\"EOTG\">''[[Servants of the Empire: Edge of the Galaxy]]''</ref>\n\n====T-7 ion disruptor shipment====\n{{Dialogue|Maketh Tua|There is nothing here.

She had been tasked with picking up some [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s, which, following their involvement with the [[Siege of Lasan|attack]] on [[Lasan]], had been banned throughout the galaxy by the [[Imperial Senate]].<ref name=\"DiD\" />\n\nSince Tua was not fluent in [[Aqualish (language)|Aqualish]], she had brought C-3PO along due to his vast knowledge of [[language]]s. When another passenger, [[Ezra Bridger]], and his [[C1-10P|astromech]] started causing a disturbance and [[Kanan Jarrus]] complained to the shuttle's pilot, [[R-3X]], the pilot sent all of the droid passengers, including C-3PO, to the back of the shuttle, as per Imperial regulations. Without her [[protocol droid]] to translate, Tua was incapable of communicating with her business partner. It was then that [[Sabine Wren]], undercover as a \"level five Imperial Academy student,\" convinced Tua to allow her to translate for Wabo. In typical rebel fashion, Sabine used Wabo's information in order to steal the weapons while misinforming Tua, tricking her into heading to Bay 17 instead of Bay 7.<ref name=\"DiD\" />\n\nUpon the arrival of Tua and her companions at Bay 17, Tua discovered that Sabine had mistranslated Wabo's words and that the disruptors were actually in Bay 7. As Tua, Wabo, and their [[stormtrooper]] escort made their way there, they were accosted by Chopper. Recognizing the orange astromech, Tua quickly realized she had been tricked and ordered all her men to Bay 7 as fast as they could. There they found the [[Spectres|rebels]] loading the weapons onto their [[Ghost|ship]]. A firefight ensued between the two factions, and the rebels escaped on the ''Ghost'' with the T-7s.<ref name=\"DiD\" />\n\nSoon after this, Tua contacted [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]]. The rebels were eventually confirmed to be the same ones that Kallus had [[Mission to free Wookiee prisoners|faced]] not long ago, on the planet [[Kessel]].<ref name=\"DiD\" />\n\n====Empire Day====\n{{Quote|Citizens, I am Minister Maketh Tua.

During the celebration, Tua stood on stage beside Commandant Aresko, who commented on Pryce's choosing him to organize what he believed to be a \"spectacle,\" to which the minister took offense. Tua then turned to address the crowd and introduced the citizens to the new [[TIE Advanced v1]] prototype, which was to be piloted by Baron [[Valen Rudor]]. As she was speaking, the TIE was destroyed by the Spectres, the explosion tossing the Tua and the other Imperials into the air as the stage collapsed. After being helped up by a stormtrooper, an infuriated Tua ordered that the party responsible be found and punished. Agent Kallus assured her they would deal with the rebels, but their priority was locating the [[Rodian]] [[Tseebo]], who had stolen Imperial secrets. Unfortunately for the Empire, however, both the rebels and the Rodian managed to flee the planet.<ref name=\"Empire Day\">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)}}</ref>\n\n====The trap====\n{{Quote|The insurgents terrorizing our world will soon be brought to justice.

See you soon, my friends.|Minister Tua's transmission as the signal was hijacked by Gall Trayvis, setting the trap|Vision of Hope}}\nTua later broadcast over Lothal, labeling the rebels insurgents before her transmission was hijacked by Senator-in-exile [[Gall Trayvis]], urging the Spectres to meet with him. In reality, Trayvis was secretly an Imperial agent tasked with luring out dissidents to be met with \"accidents.\" Tua later met with Agent Kallus, asking for his assurances that the trap they were laying for the rebels at the [[Lothal City Capitol Building]] would work. She then tried to stress [[the Grand Inquisitor]]'s desire to see the Jedi captured. Kallus stated that the Inquisitor was too focused on capturing the Jedi and stated that by targeting the rebels as a group, they would be able to get the Jedi for him.<ref name=\"VOH\">{{Rebels|Vision of Hope}}</ref>\n\nWhen the rebels arrived to meet Trayvis, Kallus and his stormtroopers surrounded them. Tua entered the building soon after, noting that Zeb and Sabine were absent. The two rebels soon revealed themselves in the rafters, dropping smoke bombs, which created enough confusion to allow the rebels to flee with Trayvis. Tua hid underneath a desk during the commotion. When the smoke had settled, she started yelling at Kallus to pursue the rebels. But once again, the rebels eluded them after discovering Trayvis' true loyalties.<ref name=\"VOH\" />\n\n====Arrival of Grand Moff Tarkin====\n{{Quote|Ah, Grand Moff Tarkin. I am honored by your visit to Lothal.''\"<br />\"''My visit is hardly an honor, Minister.''\"<br />\"''I admit I was surprised to learn you were coming.''\"<br />\"''And I, too, have been surprised by what's happening on your little backwater world.''\"<br />\"''If you are referring to the insurgents, I&mdash;''\"<br />\"''In the absence of Governor Pryce, you have had a single, simple objective, Minister&mdash;to protect the Empire's industrial interests here.

Tua greeted the governor in the hangar of the Imperial Headquarters, and nervously expressed her pleasure and surprise to have him on Lothal. Tarkin quickly admonished her for failing in her task to protect the Empire's industrial interests and allowing the rebels to flourish under her nose. Tua merely choked out an awkward cough of agreement with Tarkin's assessment of her. She was not alone in this humiliation, as Tarkin proceeded to mock Kallus and the Grand Inquisitor as well.<ref name=\"CTA\">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref>\n\nSome time later, she, Kallus and the Grand Inquisitor were summoned to Tarkin's office and stood at attention behind him as Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint arrived. Tarkin questioned the two on their ineffective methods and consistent lack of results, going so far as to suggest their failures could inspire hope in the public and undermine the security of the entire Empire. Tarkin had the two men executed to serve as a warning to Tua and the others that failure would now have deadly consequences. Though Kallus was only somewhat unsettled at the execution, Tua was downright horrified by this execution as Aresko and Grint, though incompetent, were loyal and respectful members of the Empire, barely suppressing a scream of horror.<ref name=\"CTA\" />\n\n====The Siege of Lothal====\n{{Dialogue|Tua|I'm sorry, my Lord.

Tua exhausted every resource to find information on the rebels and issued every conceivable order&mdash;doubling patrols, setting up checkpoints, and establishing curfews&mdash;but without success. After the arrival of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the [[Sith Lord]] used Tua as a pawn in his plan to incriminate the rebels.<ref name=\"TSOL\" />\n\nAs Tua explained herself to agent Kallus, Vader unexpectedly entered her office and chastised her for her lack of imagination. The frightened minister, trying not to anger the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]], countered his accusation by claiming that he and Tarkin were expecting miracles. Vader announced his plans to employ more brutal tactics, which shocked Tua, and she objected to participating, as she was a mere public official. Vader informed her that she had been summoned off-world to account for her failures to Tarkin in person, implying she would be executed. Kallus sardonically offered her assurances that he and Vader would manage in her absence.<ref name=\"TSOL\" />\n\nTua apparently discovered the Emperor's true intentions for Lothal, which made her realize that her beloved Empire was not the perfect and benevolent government she had believed it to be. Now both appalled by Vader and Tarkin's intentions and fearing for her life, she resolved to defect from the Empire. She sought the help of [[Jho|Old Jho]], who put her in contact with the rebels. In exchange for safely transporting her off Lothal, she offered secret Imperial information, including a list of Rebel sympathizers on Lothal, and other nearby systems, with powerful allies in the senate. She also claimed to know the [[Lothal Jedi Temple|real reason]] for the Empire's interest in Lothal. Faced with skepticism and hostility from most of the crew, Ezra Bridger sensed her sincerity and convinced the others to help her.<ref name=\"TSOL\" />\n\n[[File:Imperial_shuttle_explodes.png|thumb|right|250px|Tua dies in a shuttle explosion.]]\nUnfortunately for Tua, Vader had threatened her life knowing she would defect and contact the rebels in order to help escape the planet. As she attempted to covertly sneak out of Imperial headquarters, Kallus followed her as her escort. Kanan Jarrus disguised himself as a [[Stormtrooper Commander]] to get past security, but was caught by Kallus. Their cover blown, Tua fled to her escape shuttle with several of the rebels, which unbeknownst to her, had been rigged to explode. Tua was killed in the blast, and the Empire blamed the rebels for her death, using several cam droids to capture the event and use it against the \"insurgents.\"<ref name=\"TSOL\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|A beloved citizen of Lothal, Minister Tua's life was cut short by this criminal band of rebels.

Having studied abroad on worlds more cosmopolitan than her native Lothal, Tua considered herself above the people of a \"barely civilized Outer Rim world.\" She enjoyed the refined conversation of fellow intellectuals, and resented having to deal with unsavory types like Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko in the course of her duties as an Imperial public servant. Minister Tua was a loyal servant of the Empire and a graduate of the Imperial Academy.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> She followed the will of Emperor Palpatine, which brought her into contact with Agent Kallus and made her a recurring enemy of the Spectres.<ref name=\"DiD\" />\n\nShe served the Empire out of a belief in its ideas and a desire to spread law and order rather than her own personal ambitions, which set her apart from the Empire's servants such as Agent Kallus, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, and the Grand Inquisitor. Unlike her Imperial colleagues, Tua was not known to use her position as Minister to vent sadistic or even sycophantic urges,<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> but was nonetheless an ineffectual leader.<ref name=\"USW\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> Despite her expertise at managing Lothal's industrial infrastructure, Tua was not politically savvy and did not regard the governor of Kintoni's bid to expand Imperial Naval facilities as a threat to Lothal's position in the Empire. Pryce belittled Tua's foibles and despised her tendency to drift back to thinking like a native despite her offworld schooling.<ref name=\"Thrawn\" />\n\nUnlike other Imperial officials, Maketh Tua appeared to care for the common people and used her position to introduce government-sponsored housing.<ref name=\"HNN\" /> Tua threw a celebration on Empire Day to rally support for the Empire's goals on Lothal and reassure the citizens of their importance to the Empire.<ref name=\"Empire Day\" /> While she often appeared cold and authoritative, she was also friendly, as shown during an encounter with Sabine Wren, a rebel posing as a \"level five Imperial Academy student.\" However, she would bend laws and participate in underhanded actions if it served the Empire's interests. For example, she was willing to mass-produce T-7 ion disruptor rifles on the orders of the Empire, despite knowing that they had been outlawed by the Imperial Senate.<ref name=\"DiD\" /> In addition, Tua was self-absorbed<ref name=\"USW\" /> and had a short temper.<ref name=\"DiD\" />\n\n[[File:MinisterTua-SWZ.png|thumb|right|270px|Minister Tua regularly displayed confident bravado.]]\nMaketh Tua rarely displayed any sign of weakness, even in the intimidating presence of the Inquisitor. Her confident bravado was only diminished by Grand Moff Tarkin, who publicly lambasted her failings and threatened her career in the Empire's service. Tua was also visibly horrified and shaken by the summary execution of Aresko and Grint at the hands of the Grand Inquisitor. If Tarkin's measures that day weren't bad enough,<ref name=\"CTA\" /> Darth Vader's presence on Lothal&mdash;inside her own office&mdash;frightened Tua more than ever.<ref name=\"TSOL\" />\n\nTua revealed her true colors when her superiors shattered her belief in the Empire's supposed good intentions.
