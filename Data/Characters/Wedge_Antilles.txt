Just as the Empire must be destroyed. If that's going to happen, some of us have to get blood on our hands. We have to be willing to kill, and willing to die. It's not easy and it never will be. But I can tell you this much, Kyrell. It's easier than standing by and doing nothing.|Wedge Antilles, to Thane Kyrell|Lost Stars}}\n'''Wedge Antilles,''' known as '''TIE SS-2-5''' during his time at [[Skystrike Academy]], was a renowned [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] from [[Corellia]] who first served in the [[Imperial Navy]] as a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|pilot]] until defecting to join the rebellion. He would also serve in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and years later the [[New Republic]] during their fight against the [[Galactic Empire]]. He became a member of the Rebel Alliance during the [[Galactic Civil War]] and fought in several battles of the war. He fought in the [[Battle of Yavin]], where he flew in [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] alongside [[Luke Skywalker]]. After Skywalker destroyed the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]], he and Antilles were left as the only survivors of Red Squadron.\n\nIn the [[Standard year|years]] that followed, Antilles became a respected member of [[Rogue Squadron]], flying as [[Rogue Three]] during the [[Battle of Hoth]]. Antilles and his gunner [[Wes Janson]] became the first duo to successfully destroy one of the [[All Terrain Armored Transport]]s that were attempting to destroy [[Echo Base]], the Rebel outpost on the [[planet]] [[Hoth]], while aboard an [[T-47 airspeeder]]. Six [[Standard month|months]] after the evacuation from Hoth, Antilles [[Red Leader|commanded]] Red Squadron during the [[Battle of Endor]], and he and [[General]] [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] destroyed the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] during the battle. The decisive battle led to the death of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious]], and left the Empire shattered in their defeat.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance soon reorganized into the New Republic, and Antilles continued to serve in their war against the now weakened Empire. Antilles undertook a lone [[Spy|reconnaissance]] [[Mission to Akiva|mission]] to the planet [[Akiva]], where he was captured while observing a gathering of Imperial forces that were preparing for a counterattack against the Republic. Following the [[rebellion on Akiva]], Antilles formed [[Phantom Squadron]] and took part in the [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberation]] of [[Kashyyyk]]. While Phantom Squadron was disbanded by the New Republic authorities for launching an unauthorized strike on Kashyyyk, Wedge was able to reform the squadron in time for the [[Battle of Jakku]], which saw the definitive defeat of the Empire.\n\nFollowing the signing of the [[Galactic Concordance]], Antilles retired to [[Hosnian Prime]] to work as a flight instructor. Sometime afterwards Wedge [[Marriage|married]] [[Norra Wexley]] and settled back on [[Akiva]] until they were visited by Norra's son [[Temmin Wexley|Temmin]] and his wife [[Kar\u00e9 Kun]] during the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] between the [[Resistance]] and the [[First Order]].\n\nIn [[35 ABY]], Wedge [[Battle of Exegol|fought]] alongside Rebel veterans [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] and [[Chewbacca]] over [[Exegol]] against the [[Final Order|Sith Eternal fleet]] of the resurrected [[Darth Sidious]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|The Empire hurt people close to me.

As a child, he watched [[digi-drama]]s and [[Holobook|holonovel]]s about flying, such as the somber documentary ''[[Zero Hour: The Tentraxis Campaign]]'' and the memoir ''[[Fly Fast and Die Young!]]''.<ref name=\"Rendezvous Point\" /> He grew up getting his hands dirty at a [[fuel]] depot and working local [[farm]]s in his spare time,<ref name=\"Aftermath\" /> and where he became a [[pilot]] and a [[Technician|mechanic]].<ref name=\"Ultimate SW\" /> While still young, Wedge had people taken from him by [[pirate]]s, and borrowed an old [[starfighter]] to chase down their [[gunboat]]. He shot a hole in the ship's aft [[deflector shield]]s and fired through at zero angle, destroying the pirate vessel. He initially felt good, having made his first kill, but afterwards threw up throughout the night.<ref name=\"Rendezvous Point\" />\n\nAt a time when Antilles was flying [[Freighter|cargo ships]] out of busy ports, the [[Galactic Empire]] recruited him and he accepted as it seemed more exciting than hauling spare parts around [[the galaxy]].<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\" /> Antilles enrolled in [[Skystrike Academy]],<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" /> located on [[Montross]],<ref name=\"Skystrike Academy\">{{Databank|skystrike-academy|Skystrike Academy|archivedate=20191010041745}}</ref> to train as an elite [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilot]].

They dispatched the former Imperial cadet and [[Mandalorian]] explosives expert [[Sabine Wren]] on an [[Escape from Skystrike Academy|undercover mission]] to rescue the cadets. Sabine infiltrated the Academy as a cadet under the name \"Ria Talla.\"<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\nAntilles met \"Talla\" during a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] [[Flight simulator|simulator]] exercise, in which they destroyed several rebel [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wings]] but hesitated at shooting an unarmed [[transport]]. As a result, their fighters were destroyed by a simulated version of the ''[[Ghost]]'', flown by [[Captain]] [[Vult Skerris]], who lectured Antilles and Wren that the consequence of insubordination was [[death]] in combat. Following the exercise, Antilles warned Wren that people at the Academy did not usually care about ethics. After [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] and Kallus arrived to investigate rumors of defectors, Gahree argued that they were undertaking risky action, but Antilles told him and Klivian to relax.<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\n====Defection====\nLater, Antilles met with Wren at a [[Hangar|hangar bay]] where he confided his unease with the recent simulator exercise. He voiced that he had not signed up to kill indiscriminately, and finally expressed a desire to leave, to which Wren revealed her true name and reassured Antilles that the rebels had gotten his message. She then told Antilles and his friends to be ready to leave at a moment's notice, but when he asked Wren about her plan, she responded that she would think it up, much to Antilles' surprise.<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\nAn opportunity to escape arose when Pryce had [[Commandant]] [[Goran]] order the cadets to engage in a mock combat exercise in space. When Wren's support [[CR90 corvette]] arrived, Antilles, Gahree and Klivian followed at her direction towards the rebel [[corvette]]. However, Governor Pryce disabled their [[solar collector]]s, leaving them stranded in space. Under her orders, Captain Skerris destroyed Gahree's fighter as a warning to the rebels and drove away the rebel vessel. Antilles, Klivian, and Wren were brought before Pryce, who demanded to know which one of them was the rebel agent and threatened to fasten Antilles to a [[torture]] device. To protect him, Wren identified herself as the agent. The trio was then separated, as Kallus escorted Antilles and Klivian to their [[Prison|holding cell]].<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\n[[File:The_Antilles_Extraction_thumb.png|thumb|right|250px|Antilles and \"Hobbie\" Klivian with Sabine Wren.]]\nInside, the two pilots argued about the merits of escaping without a plan, when they were freed by Wren after she had escaped from Pryce. Being pursued by [[stormtrooper]]s, the trio fled down a corridor only to run into Agent Kallus, who due to his [[Ambush on an Imperial construction module|encounter]] with Wren's comrade [[Garazeb Orrelios]], helped them to escape by telling them to head to Hangar 24. Once there, the fugitives commandeered a [[TIE/sa bomber]]. Antilles piloted the slow-moving craft which was pursued by Skerris' [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE Interceptor]]. Despite taking several hits, the trio managed to escape when Wren's rebel comrades arrived in their CR90 corvette, they made the jump into [[hyperspace]] together. Upon their arrival at [[Chopper Base]] on [[Atollon]], they were greeted by [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]], who welcomed Antilles and Klivian into the [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|rebellion]].<ref name=\"The Antilles Extraction\" />\n\n====Chopper Base====\n{{Quote|Hobbie, Wedge, let's go!

During his absence, an [[E-XD-series infiltrator droid]] designated [[EXD-9]] [[EXD-9's infiltration of Chopper Base|found]] the base and attempted to broadcast its location to the [[Imperial Navy]], only for Garazeb Orrelios, [[AP-5]], and [[C1-10P]] to send it back to its [[Star Destroyer]] with its [[self-destruct mechanism]] activated. Although the rebellion was able to keep the location of its Atollon base secret for the time being, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] was able to use the incident to narrow down the possibilities for the base's location.<ref name=\"Warhead\" />\n\n====Killun 71====\n{{Quote|Now I can see why I got this mission.

For the mission, Wedge was disguised as a TIE fighter pilot and was accompanied by the rebel droids AP-5 and Chopper. The rebels traveled to the base in a stolen [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]].<ref name=\"DAD\">{{Rebels|Double Agent Droid}}</ref>\n\nWedge found AP-5 and Chopper to be petty and quarrelsome. Antilles was irked by AP-5's fastidiousness but remained focused on the mission. Using stolen clearance codes and posing as a TIE fighter pilot, Antilles managed to land the ''Sentinel'' shuttle without incident at Killun Station under the pretext of delivering two new droids to the base. While Antilles waited aboard the shuttle, AP-5 and Chopper infiltrated the base. AP-5 managed to obtain the clearance codes from the central computer. However, Chopper was hijacked by a team of Imperial [[slicer]]s while accessing a terminal network.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nDuring the return journey, Antilles did not suspect anything suspicious about Chopper. The Imperial-controlled Chopper curried favor with Antilles by offering him [[blue milk]]. AP-5 tried to warn Wedge but the young pilot thought that the [[RA-7 protocol droid]] was being paranoid. Wedge was irked when AP-5 followed him into the [[refresher]] and accused the protocol droid of dabbling in conspiracy theories. Unknown to AP-5 and Wedge, their movements and conversations were being watched by the Imperial slicers, whose [[LT-319|controller]] was determined to find the location of Chopper Base.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nAfter returning to the ''Ghost'', Antilles told Hera, Ezra, and Zeb that AP-5 and Chopper were playing a sort of spy game. While Zeb and Ezra shared Wedge's sentiments, AP-5 insisted that something was wrong and managed to warn Hera. While Hera stopped Chopper from downloading the ship's hyperspace logs, Wedge related his encounter with AP-5 in the refresher. After Hera returned to the common area and reaffirmed AP-5's warnings, Antilles joined the Spectres in searching for Chopper, who had headed to the engine room.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nChopper managed to trap the rebels in the cargo bay and seal the entrances. Under the control of his Imperial handlers, Chopper then exposed the cargo bay to [[Realspace|zero gravity space]] in an attempt to kill the rebels. Hera managed to seal the hatch manually but the rebels were unable to return to the cockpit. Since AP-5 did not need a spacesuit and had a magnetic body, the protocol droid was dispatched to open the cargo bay from outside. This enabled Wedge and the other rebels to enter the cockpit, stun Chopper, and remove the [[Computer spike|data spike]] which the Imperials were using to download data from the ''Ghost''{{'s}} [[navigation computer]].<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nHera then removed the Imperial programming from Chopper and retaliated against the Imperials by transmitting a large amount of data back to the [[IGV-55 surveillance vessel]] that the slicers were operating from. This data overload caused the ''Gozanti'' cruiser to explode, eliminating the Imperial threat to the rebellion. After returning Chopper to his prior state, the rebels rescued AP-5, who was stranded in space. Antilles was present at the cargo bay when AP-5 reunited with the other rebels. When AP-5 insulted Chopper for apologizing, Chopper waved his appendages. One of them struck Antilles, who expressed his frustration with the droids and insisted on flying solo.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\n====Battle of Atollon====\n[[File:WedgeAntillesRZ1Awing-SWZ83.png|thumb|left|250px|Antilles during the Battle of Atollon.]]\n{{Quote|Phoenix Squadron, let's get out of here!\"''<br />\"''Roger, Phoenix Leader.

He explained the test to the newcomer, and noting that Skywalker had lasted over 30 seconds on his first try, Antilles advised him to listen, and encouraged not to give up.

It involved [[starfighter]]s assaulting the Death Star and firing a [[proton torpedo]] into a two-[[meter]]-wide [[thermal exhaust port]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Wedge_Antilles.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Antilles during the Battle of Yavin.]]\nAs a member of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], Antilles flew a [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] under the [[callsign]] \"[[Red Two]]\" when the Alliance launched the [[Battle of Yavin]]. With only fifteen minutes to spare, Antilles destroyed a number of enemy targets but, in the process, lost his friend Porkins to enemy fire. When Skywalker was unable to shake a TIE fighter that pursued him, Antilles destroyed the TIE fighter and saved the rookie pilot.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nAs [[Red Leader]] [[Garven Dreis]] failed in his attempt to fire a torpedo into the reactor shaft and was killed by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] on his [[TIE Advanced x1]], Antilles joined Skywalker and Darklighter in a trench run, covering Skywalker on the lead. A hit from one of Vader's escort TIE fighters damaged hydraulic lines on Antilles' X-wing (which had been hastily repaired following the Battle of Scarif), forcing him to pull out of the trench shortly before Darklighter was killed by Vader. Antilles attempted to re-enter the trench with a group of TIE fighters trailing him, but backed off after Skywalker was able to fire proton torpedoes at the exhaust port, with help from the timely arrival of the ''Millennium Falcon'', piloted by Skywalker's friends [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]].

Skywalker ordered his squadron to begin using tow cables to bring them crashing down, and Antilles and Janson were assigned to the first attempt. Janson shot the tow cable onto one of the AT-ATs while Antilles piloted the airspeeder around the [[walker]], tangling its legs in the cables until the giant vehicle fell onto the snowy battlefield. The crash left its neck exposed, and Antilles fired the shot that hit the weak point and destroyed the AT-AT,<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> becoming the first pilot in the battle to destroy one of the walkers.<ref name=\"DB:Wedge\" />\n\nThe efforts of the Rogue Squadron were ultimately unsuccessful\u2014the AT-ATs destroyed the shield generator, and Imperial forces led by Darth Vader overran Echo Base.

The two reminisced about their lost squadron members, particularly Antilles' close friend Hobbie until [[S-5V3]] arrived to tell Antilles that he was required in the Chancellor's office. There, he met [[The Contessa]], who told him to rebuild Rogue Squadron so they could fly a mission to take out a group of pirates that were disrupting supply routes. If they failed, the fleet would be forced to leave their location and abandon the potential to rendezvous with Skywalker, Organa, and the missing rebels. Antilles was promoted to Commander, replacing Skywalker as the leader of the remaining pilots of [[Rogue Squadron|Rogue Group]], and despite his objections, was tasked with scraping together enough qualified pilots.<ref name=\"Rendezvous Point\">{{Shortstory|story=Rendezvous Point (short story)|sformatted=Rendezvous Point|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>\n\nAntilles then met with his new [[executive officer]] in Janson, to find pilots from across the fleet. He recruited [[Bela Elar]] and [[Will Scotian]], who were already experienced pilots, to lead their own flights within the squadron. Antilles told Janson he did not want to use the Rogue Group name, due to the losses suffered so soon after the Battle of Hoth. Instead, Antilles settled on resurrecting the Red Squadron name. Antilles and Janson then listed off potential pilots to roster. Janson mentioned [[Aron Polstak]], but he was away on a special assignment. Antilles and Janson alternated suggestions, settling with a variety of newcomers, including [[Keyser Salm]], the younger brother of [[Horton Salm]], who had flown with them before, [[Barlon Hightower]], [[Cinda Tarheel]], [[Sila Kott]], [[Ix Ixstra]], [[Grizz Frix]], [[Penn Zowlie]], and [[Tomer Darpen]].<ref name=\"Rendezvous Point\" />\n\nAntilles put the group through two days of intensive sim training, which ended in Antilles expressing his doubts to The Contessa about their readiness. However, time was no longer a luxury and The Contessa gave Red Squadron their first mission: to eliminate the pirates and their base that was located on an old asteroid mining station. The battle saw him lose Hightower, Zowlie, and Ixstra, but Antilles led Red Squadron to a total victory over the pirates.<ref name=\"Rendezvous Point\" />\n\n====Protecting the Rendezvous Point====\nA day later, Antilles led Red Squadron's [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]]s in an attack on a nearby [[pirate]] base that threatened the safety of the Alliance rendezvous point.

The squadron was tasked with finding the scattered divisions of the Rebel Alliance fleet following the evacuation of Hoth, to warn them that the Galactic Empire had cracked Alliance communications and to deliver a new [[Trawak]] security code that C-3PO and his team had developed. During their search, the squadron discovered wreckage of the [[Sixth Division]] near [[Felucia]] and encountered Imperial [[Viper probe droid|probe droids]] waiting nearby. The probe droids latched onto the astromechs of the X-wings and attempted to access their archives. Fearing the probe droids getting the other rendezvous points, Antilles suggested shooting them off, but [[Shara Bey]] ([[Starlight Leader]]) questioned their chances. Instead, Bey ordered all pilots to set their astromech's self-destruct and eject them, even though this meant losing their nav data and their way home. With no other choice, the droids were ejected and detonated, saving their valuable data from the Empire. The Starlight pilots had no time to catch their breath, as the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Tarkin's Will]]'' arrived and attacked the squadron.<ref name=\"Star Wars 10\" />\n\n====Zastiga====\nEventually Antilles became the leader of Red Squadron, and traveled to [[Zastiga]] where he met with Skywalker whilst Alliance High Command held a top-clearance meeting.

After another confrontation with Tashu, Antilles escaped after Sloane had destroyed part of the palace with one of the [[Turbolaser|turbolaser cannons]] set up across [[Myrra]], to stop Norra Wexley's assault. Though Antilles discovered a secret passage to escape, he decided to stay; he fought [[Adea Rite]] over her [[Viewscreen|holoscreen]] and sent a summons to war to the Republic channels, before passing out and falling in Sloane's hands again.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n[[File:AdmiralSloane-BTCG.png|thumb|left|220px|Admiral Sloane, an enemy of Wedge.]]\nStrapped down to a hovering table ushered forward by a pair of stormtroopers and a [[2-1B-series medical droid|2-1B medical droid]], the badly-injured Antilles was later transported to the ''[[Golden Harp]]'', when he saluted Norra Wexley\u2014who had been trying to rescue him.

Thanks to them, was brought to [[Hanna City]] in [[Chandrila]], where he received medical treatment. After a week, he met with Ackbar, and together they awarded Norra Wexley a [[medal]], but also informed her of the [[Rebellion on Akiva|battle's]] outcome, and assigned her and her team from Akiva a new mission\u2014to hunt Imperial war criminals.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" />\n\n====Friend of the Wexleys====\n{{Quote|And hey, watch your mouth, will you?

Meanwhile, he worked as a liaison for Wexley's team, and trained Temmin (whom he nicknamed \"Snap\" for habit) as an X-wing pilot.

At the same time, he decided to create [[Phantom Squadron]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nAfter a few months, Leia Organa asked Antilles to help her find her missing husband, Han Solo. Antilles accepted and, as per her request, summoned Norra Wexley to her as soon as she and her team arrived from their [[Capture of Perwin Gedde|mission]] to capture [[Perwin Gedde]]. Once she accepted the mission to find Solo, Antilles told [[Kyrsta Agate]] about the mission before accompanying Wexley on her [[MK-4 freighter]] [[Moth (freighter)|''Moth'']] to Solo's last known location, near [[Warrin Station]], and invited her to a drink before arriving at the coordinates. Though they found no trace of the ''Millennium Falcon'', they found wreckage and a still-functioning [[Prowler 1000 seeker droid|Prowler probe droid]], which alerted their presence to the Star Destroyer ''[[Scythe]]''.

Their search eventually meant the liberation of [[prisoner]]s from [[Ashmead's Lock]] on [[Kashyyyk]], who traveled to Chandrila on the ''Falcon''.

That day, Antilles was overlooking the day's events from a balcony when he received a recorded message from Organa, telling him she had gone to the [[Kashyyyk system]] alone with Evaan Verlaine on the ''Falcon'', and invited him to intervene. At once, Antilles notified Mon Mothma of this but promptly left Chandrila alongside Phantom Squadron.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nCaptain Antilles' Phantom Squadron and Princess Leia battled the three Imperial Star Destroyers ''[[Dominion]]'', ''[[Vitiator]]'' and ''[[Neutralizer]]'' above Kashyyyk. Their meager forces were soon reinforced by Admiral Ackbar's flagship ''Home One''. Han Solo managed to hijack the ''Dominion'' and turned the ship's guns on the ''Vitiator'' and ''Neutralizer''; destroying the former and forcing the latter to surrender. Though they were successful, and Organa was reunited with Solo, the Republic had received a blow during the concurrent [[attack on Chandrila]] and the scattered Imperial Fleet gathered on [[Jakku]].<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nFollowing the liberation of Kashyyyk, Wedge watched his friend Temmin crash an X-wing during a computer simulator exercise.

He also promised the boy that if he improved his simulator scores, he could arrange for Temmin to have a ship before the next moon alignment. When Temmin remarked that his own father Brentin, who had been implanted with an inorganic biochip, had tried to assassinate Chancellor Mothma, Wedge asked if things with Norra were better.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nTemmin then complimented Wedge for his flying during the liberation of Kashyyyk. Wedge responded that the full credit should go to Leia. Wedge also added that he had done what Leia had needed him to do and also warned Snap to watch his language. Temmin addressed Wedge as \"Dad\" and promised to do as he said. Temmin then asked if he could go for another round on the simulator but changed his mind after receiving a message from his mother Norra.

Under Wedge's orders, Phantom Squadron attacked any TIE fighters, troop carriers, and Imperial walkers they encountered.

Still, he was a good team player and joined forces with his fellow rebels to steal Imperial clearance codes and to prevent an Imperial-hijacked Chopper from transmitting the coordinates of Chopper Base to the Empire.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\n[[File:Wedge_helmet_SW_Costumes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wedge's flight helmet]]\nThrough his service to the Rebel Alliance, he garnered the respect of his fellow Rebel fighters.<ref name=\"DB:Wedge\" /> Focused and calm during his flights,<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"Episode V\" /><ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> he firmly believed that the only way to improve as a pilot was to constantly come up against the impossible and push oneself to the limit; during battles, he would concentrate on keeping his cool and trusting his instincts.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> Antilles disliked being away from a cockpit for too long, and though he did not mind commanding, Norra Wexley once noticed that his whole body seemed to hunger for being behind a flight stick.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Despite his talent and standing among his fellow pilots, Antilles remained approachable and friendly to those around him.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /><ref name=\"Weapon of a Jedi\" />\n\nBitter at the Empire for what it had done to the people he loved,<ref name=\"Aftermath\" /> Antilles had an unwavering strength of belief in the Alliance,<ref name=\"LS\" /> and although courageous and full of resolve, he once resorted to bravado at the prospect of being tortured to death.<ref name=\"Aftermath\" /> He was also unaccustomed to not being taken at his word\u2014if he believed someone was good and told them so, he really meant it as he was not one to flatter others in his own interest,<ref name=\"LS\" /> and was not capable of telling others easy lies.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> Antilles was known to be fond of giving everyone lectures about trigger discipline, which meant not putting one's finger on the trigger until they were ready to pull it.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" />\n\nWedge's loyalty to Princess Leia led him and his Phantom Squadron pilots to take part in an unsanctioned mission to liberate Kashyyyk.<ref name=\"Life Debt\" /> While the New Republic military leadership publicly praised Wedge and his fellow pilots, they were transferred to support duties as punishment for acting outside the official chain of command. Due to this disciplinary action, Wedge was despondent and unwilling to take risks. However, his friend Temmin managed to convince him to change his mind by reminding Wedge of his past heroism during the Galactic War. Wedge was a competent commander who led his squadron in attacking Imperial ground forces on Jakku in order to aid the New Republic ground assault.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\nThough he was getting older in his later years, Wedge refused to admit it, even rebuking Kare Kun when she asked if he needed assistance.<ref name=\"Resistance Reborn\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n{{Quote|You have a way with words for just a pilot.|Rae Sloane|Aftermath (novel)}}\nAntilles was a renowned pilot in the Rebel Alliance.

He would eventually obtain the highest scores, only surpassed by Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> Due to his training as a TIE fighter pilot, Antilles was familiar with Imperial military protocol which helped him during an undercover mission to steal Imperial clearance codes.<ref name=\"DAD\" />\n\nAs a skilled starfighter pilot, Wedge shot down several Imperial fighters, transports, and walkers during the Battle of Jakku. In recognition of his efforts, Antilles was made the head flight instructor of a New Republic flight academy on Hosnian Prime following the Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"Empire's End\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nWedge Antilles first appeared as a supporting character in the [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], where he was credited as \"Red Two (Wedge).\"<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> His surname is never mentioned in any of the films, but appears in the script for ''A New Hope''. The character's origins can be traced to early drafts of ''Star Wars'', which depicted a young pilot named Chewie. That nickname was later given to Chewbacca, so the character that had been known as Chewie took on the name of Wedge.<ref name=\"Making ANH\">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Johnd.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Colin Higgins as \"Fake Wedge\" in ''A New Hope''.]]\nAntilles was portrayed by two actors in ''A New Hope''.
