In [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], Lin's mother [[Myoris Lin|Myoris]] and a number of classmates were kidnapped by [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] forces acting under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], who intended to use the children as bait to draw out several key [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] leaders. Lin escaped and enlisted the help of Rebels [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and aided in the rescue mission that freed the hostages before fleeing Harix.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|I'm sorry they captured your mother, kid!  Go ahead and cry!|Luke Skywalker to Berd, shortly after their escape from Harix.|Bring Me the Children}}\nBerd was enrolled in a school where his mother [[Myoris Lin]] was a teacher. Because her sympathies lay with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], Myoris's school was subject to an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] raid led by [[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Stafuv Rahz]]. When Rahz's [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] attempted to break into the school, Berd was ushered into an escape tunnel along with his fellow students by Myoris.<ref name=\"BMTC\" /> After exiting the tunnel, Berd evaded capture by the stormtroopers and encountered [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]]. Luke and the droids had been planning to deliver a collection of [[micro-book]]s that had been published prior to the reorganization of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Though his mission had been thwarted by the raid, Skywalker helped Berd escape from Harix.<ref name=\"BMTC\" />\n\nShortly after they had left the planet, Berd immediately tried to formulate a plan to save his mother and his classmates from certain doom. When Luke assigned C-3PO to take care of him, Berd made his displeasure known, insisting that his time \"must be given to saving my mother and my friends.\" To this end, he ran away from C-3PO when he was supposed to be sleeping and attempted to recruit [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and a number of former [[Smuggler/Legends|smugglers]] to help him rescue his mother.<ref name=\"BMTC\" /> Though Berd was initially unsuccessful in persuading the [[Spacer/Legends|spacers]], his plight struck a chord in [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca's]] charitable nature. Chewbacca's willingness to volunteer, Luke's reproachful words towards Han and the others and the combined egos of all of the spacers present at the time caused an atmosphere of generosity to prevail within the confines of the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]].<ref name=\"BMTC\" />\n\nShortly before the rescue mission was to be launched, Berd had a dream in which his mother warned him that the Empire had set a trap for any would-be rescuers in a cut slot behind the [[Talhu Slotted Peaks]] on Harix. When he informed them of his premonition, the spacers decided that his claims were dubious and they considered abandoning his cause altogether. However, Han and Luke decided that there might have been some merit to Berd's dream. Berd discarded his original rescue plan and quelled the protests of the spacers by relating his new plan to them.<ref name=\"BMTC\" /> When they put his plan into action, [[Luke Skywalker's \"Tub\"|Luke's ship]] arrived near Harix and launched a fleet of [[target drone]]s set on a direct course for Harix. Each individual drone was modified to project a false signature of itself and as a result it would show up on most [[Sensor/Legends|sensors]] as a ship much larger than it actually was. While the Imperial forces holding the blockade moved away from Harix to engage what they thought was a large Alliance battle fleet, the fleet of freighters used the distraction to land on Harix without being noticed.<ref name=\"BMTC\" />\n\nLuke, Han and Chewbacca left Berd and [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] to wait with the fleet of [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]] while they took care of the trap &mdash; a group of landed [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighters]] lying in wait for any would-be rescuers. When he heard [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] fire coming from the general direction of the trap, Berd wanted to go to help Luke and Han, but Leia managed to keep him from running off. After Leia received Han's signal that the trap had been destroyed, she and Berd, along with the fleet of freighters landed at the school. They found that Luke and Han had gotten to the school ahead of them and had managed to save Myoris and her students from being vaporized by Rahz's [[sonic projector]] but in doing so, had ended up in a rather sticky situation.<ref name=\"BMTC\" /> The spacers exited their freighters and made short work of Rahz's squad of stormtroopers and captured Rahz. Though Berd was reunited with his mother, their relief at seeing each other once more was short-lived. Rahz managed to break free of his captors, but Berd had a good idea of what Rahz wanted to do and made some last-minute modifications to the sonic projector.<ref name=\"BMTC\" /> Rahz avoided being hit by the spacers' blaster fire and manned the sonic projector. Berd intended to simply disable the projector by rephasing its power, but his modification had the unintended side effect of refocusing the sonic projector's power through its control panel and as a result, Rahz was killed when he tried to to fire the gun. When word came that Imperial forces were approaching Harix, the Rebels and spacers brought Berd, his mother and his classmates along when they fled from the planet.<ref name=\"BMTC\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|The last thing I need is a baby-sitter!|Berd Lin|Bring Me the Children}}\nA child prodigy,<ref name=\"aite\">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/insideronline/97/indexp4.html|text=Aliens in the Empire, Part 2: To a Traitor Go the Spoils|int=Aliens in the Empire}}</ref> Berd Lin showed a maturity and savvy beyond his years during his battle with the Empire on Harix, caring only about saving the lives of his mother and classmates. Lin believed strongly in the hope and promise of the Rebellion, and proved to be a brilliant natural tactician. The young man had little fear of a fight, and also possessed a high level of technical knowledge, already possessing the knowledge to rewire a sonic projector.<ref name=\"BMTC\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nBerd Lin first appeared in ''[[Bring Me the Children]]'', a [[Star Wars (comic strip)|comic strip]] story arc written by [[Don Christensen]] and released in [[1980]].
