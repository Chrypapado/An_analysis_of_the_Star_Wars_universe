A murderer's on the loose and it's my job to find him.|Lieutenant Tan Divo, Coruscant Security Force inspector|Senate Murders}}\n'''Tan Divo''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|police]] [[Inspector/Legends|inspector]] in the [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|Coruscant Security Force]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Though somewhat arrogant, Divo was good at his [[Police officer/Legends|job]] which allowed him to climb in the CSF hierarchy, attaining the [[Police rank|rank]] of [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]] by c. [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]]. Divo was assigned to several notable cases including the [[Kidnapping of the Papanoida daughters/Legends|kidnapping]] of the [[Che Amanwe Papanoida/Legends|two]] [[Chi Eekway Papanoida/Legends|daughters]] of [[Pantoran/Legends|Pantoran]] [[Chairman/Legends|Chairman]] [[Notluwiski Papanoida/Legends|Notluwiski Papanoida]] by the Separatists. Though Divo made assurances of his ultimate success in the investigation, his team missed [[Blood/Legends|blood]] on the bottom of Papanoida's [[Icon of the Moon Goddess/Legends|Icon of the Moon Goddess]] during a scan of the chairman's [[Papanoida's Coruscant apartment|apartment]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. This prevented Divo from receiving a vital clue to the identity of the kidnappers, and the case from Divo's perspective went cold.\n\nDivo was also called to investigate the [[Death/Legends|death]] of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Onaconda Farr/Legends|Onaconda Farr]]. Relying on his instincts as an [[Detective/Legends|investigator]], Divo rejected Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala/Legends|Padm\u00e9 Amidala's]] opinions as to the cause of Farr's death, concluding that Farr had been [[Poison/Legends|poisoned]]. Divo's dismissal led her to pursue a separate investigation with the assistance of Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa/Legends|Bail Organa]]. After an attempt on the lives of Amidala and Organa at the [[Docks under the derrick major/Legends|Coruscant docks]], the body of Senator [[Mee Deechi/Legends|Mee Deechi]] was discovered in his [[Mee Deechi's office|office]], and Divo opened a second investigation into Deechi's homicide. Divo was able to gather evidence in both cases and further his investigations. Throughout the affair, Divo had little regard for [[Politics/Legends|politics]] and was frustrated by Amidala's constant meddling. After [[Lolo Purs/Legends|Lolo Purs]], Farr's [[Aide/Legends|assistant]], accused Senator [[Halle Burtoni/Legends|Halle Burtoni]] of [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]] of attacking her and as Farr had been killed with a [[Kaminoan/Legends|Kaminoan]]-engineered poison, Divo arrested Burtoni for the murders. However, the killer was revealed to be Lolo Purs herself. After intervention by Divo and Amidala, Purs was taken into custody. Purs' reasons for the murder confirmed Divo's original theory: that the Senator had been killed due to his past.\n\n==Biography==\n===The Papanoida kidnappings===\n{{Quote|We are in complete control of the situation.|Tan Divo, to Chairman Papanoida|Sphere of Influence}}\nA [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], Tan Divo lived on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and entered the field of [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|law enforcement]] as a [[Police officer/Legends|police officer]] with the [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|Coruscant Security Force]].

Though Divo made assurances of a continued investigation to Papanoida and his son, [[Ion Papanoida/Legends|Ion Papanoida]], the case largely became cold with no evidence. Unbeknownst to the CSF, the [[Icon of the Moon Goddess/Legends|Icon]] of the [[Moon Goddess/Legends|Moon Goddess]] had been moved from its original position in Papanoida's apartment. Under the icon was a small sample of [[Blood/Legends|blood]] left by Greedo when he was struck by the icon during the struggle with Papanoida's daughters. After finding the blood and identifying its source, Papanoida, with the [[Rescue on the Pantora Droid Control Ship/Legends|help]] of [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]], was able to [[Rescue in the Mos Eisley Cantina/Legends|rescue]] his daughters.<ref name=\"Sphere\" />\n\n===Homicides in the Senate===\n====Initial investigation====\n{{Quote|What makes you think it was murder?''\"<br />\"''Poison, of course.

While enjoying refreshments including [[Domaine de la Maison sur le Lac/Legends|Domaine de la Maison sur le Lac]] [[Alcohol/Legends|wine]], Farr choked and [[Death/Legends|died]]. The CSF responded to the suspicious death, bypassing the [[Senate Guard/Legends|Senate Guard]],<ref name=\"SM\" /> which normally held priority over incidents involving senators.<ref name=\"Omegasquad\">''[[Omega Squad: Targets]]''</ref> Divo was assigned as the inspector on the case<ref name=\"SM\" /> and was assisted by his [[LEP servant droid/Legends|servant droid]], [[LEP-171B/Legends|LEP-171B]],<ref name=\"visguide\">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: New Battlefronts: The Visual Guide]]''</ref> and several police droids. Samples were taken of the drinks, and the [[Forensics Unit|forensics]] report concluded that a [[Poison/Legends|poison]] had been given to the Senator, thereby classifying the death as a homicide. After the [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] Senator's [[Funeral of Onaconda Farr/Legends|funeral]], Farr's [[Politics/Legends|political]] allies were summoned to [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Chancellor's Suite|office]] in the [[Republic Executive Building]].<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\n[[File:TanDivowithdroid.png|thumb|right|275px|Divo begins his investigation.]]\nThere, Divo revealed that Farr had not died of natural causes but had in fact been murdered. He asked the senators if they knew of anyone who hated Farr and suggested that something from his past had been the reason for his murder. The senators responded that Farr had been loved, and Amidala suggested that Farr had been killed because of someone who was angry over the proposed military spending reduction bill. Divo was dismissive of that idea and told the senators to stay out of his investigation.<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\nNot convinced by Divo's assurances, Amidala had decided to pursue her own theory. She began by questioning Farr's political enemies, Senators [[Mee Deechi/Legends|Mee Deechi]] and [[Halle Burtoni/Legends|Halle Burtoni]]. Deechi revealed that he had Farr followed to dig up dirt on the Senator and that the night before his death, Farr had gone to the [[Docks under the derrick major/Legends|Coruscant docks]] for a clandestine meeting. Though reminded by her friends that Divo had ordered them to stay out of the investigation, Amidala went to the docks with Organa. There, they were ambushed and [[Blaster/Legends|shot]] at though they did not know the identity of the attacker. The disturbance alerted CSF forces and police [[Droid/Legends|droids]] secured the crime scene. After arriving on the scene with LEP-171B, Divo expressed his annoyance at Amidala's actions. Not only had she failed to inform him of her lead at the docks and had gone to investigate herself, but she had also made his job more difficult by alerting the killer to the fact that the investigation was closing in on the culprit.<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\n====A second murder====\n{{Quote|Senator Amidala, is it possible you may be going deaf?''\"<br />\"''Lieutenant?''\"<br />\"''Because when I said I didn't want you to interfere with my investigation, I can only assume that you didn't ''hear'' me.''\"<br />\"''I had some information about a lead here at the docks.''\"<br />\"''Which you naturally brought to me straight away so I could investigate it, only, no wait&mdash;you did the exact ''opposite'' of that!|Tan Divo sarcastically lectures Padm\u00e9 Amidala|Senate Murders}}\nIn a show of frustration, Divo told Amidala and Organa that they had generated a great deal of paper work for him to file. He also lectured Amidala on the importance of rules and their importance to keep the peace and maintain order. During the conversation, Amidala came to believe that Deechi might have been responsible for the attempt on her life, as he was the one who had told her about the docks. Though Divo tried to tell her to slow down, she ignored him, and the frustrated inspector followed her and Organa back to [[Mee Deechi's office|Deechi's office]]. There, they found Deechi stabbed to death in his chair.<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\n[[File:Csfcrimescene.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Divo investigating the Coruscant docks crime scene]]\nIn order to secure the lives of the individuals involved in the case including Senators Amidala and Organa as well as Farr's assistant Lolo Purs, Divo gathered all of them together at the [[Senate Building]] and told them they would be placed under the protection of CSF and Senate Guard forces. However, Lolo Purs refused and left the room. Divo questioned the remaining persons about who else had been aware that Amidala and Organa were going to the docks. In response, Amidala stated that the only other person who had known was Senator Burtoni. Though Divo tried to locate Burtoni, she was nowhere to be found. He returned to the senators in time for Purs to burst in and claim that Burtoni had attacked her. Divo ordered the Senate Guards and CSF droids to find Burtoni, and the police conducted a search of her [[Halle Burtoni's office|office]], without success. Eventually they were able to capture her and bring her to the Chancellor's office, where several individuals involved with the case, including Amidala and Organa as well as Chancellor Palpatine, were waiting. Initial questioning by Divo led Burtoni to deny any involvement in both Farr's murder and the attack on Purs. Divo then revealed that a forensics report indicated that the poison used to kill Farr, one that was lethal only to Rodians, was [[Kaminoan/Legends|Kaminoan]]-made in origin. With that evidence in hand, Divo ordered Burtoni taken away.<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\nHowever, at that point, Amidala noticed that since the poison must have been in everyone's drink, Purs should have died as well, as she was also Rodian. Amidala then remembered that Purs had not drunk anything. Purs, feeling revealed and exposed, pulled out a small [[Hold-out blaster/Legends|blaster]] and took Amidala hostage. When asked why by Amidala, Purs answered that she had killed Farr because of the war he had brought to [[Rodia/Legends|Rodia]] and that a new and morally stronger leader was needed. As Deechi had known about the meeting, Purs had felt that he had to be removed as well. Her confession validated Divo's original theory, as it had been a mistake from Farr's past that had led to his murder. During the conversation, Divo, unnoticed by Purs, discreetly activated the police droids outside of the Chancellor's office. They surprised Purs at the door, allowing Amidala to break away and knock her unconscious. The police droids and Divo then took Purs into custody.<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|After all, I'm the inspector, you're the Senator, so I'll handle the inspecting, and you can stick to the&hellip; the ''Senating''.|Tan Divo, to Padm\u00e9 Amidala|Senate Murders}}\n[[File:UnderMyProtection-SM.png|thumb|right|300px|Divo instructs the senators on security precautions.]]\nTan Divo was a light-skinned Human male with a short squared body at 1.8 [[Imperial standard meter|meters]] tall, [[Color/Legends|gray]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], red [[Eye/Legends|eyes]],<ref name=\"encycdivo\" /> and a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] on his [[Ear/Legends|ear]].<ref name=\"CE\">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia]]''</ref> He was armed with an [[A43 Hushabye pistol]] and a small [[Baton/Legends|baton]]. He carried these as well as other equipment on his [[Utility belt/Legends|utility belt]]. Divo was a competent and effective police officer, though he subscribed to an old school of thought in police investigations<ref name=\"Senate Murders Episode commentary\" /> that asserted that only the police could collect evidence and solve crimes. Consequently, his ideas on means, motives, and opportunity had to fit within the evidence he discovered.<ref name=\"SM\" /> In his confidence of his abilities, Divo would also at times forget the support that he received from police droids.<ref name=\"encycpdroid\">{{SWE|technology|policedroid|police droid}}</ref> Two things that Divo disliked most were politicians and report writing, though the latter was ironically one of his talents.<ref name=\"CE\" />\n\nAs an inspector, Divo had a conflicting reputation on being able to solve crimes. His methodology allowed him to rise through the ranks to lieutenant; yet he was viewed by some as incompetent and useless.<ref name=\"SM\" /><ref name=\"Sphere\" /> In some cases Divo was viewed as incompetent even though he did not have all the facts. While investigating the disappearance of Chairman Papanoida's daughters, he conducted what he believed was a thorough sweep of their apartment but failed to find a sample of blood on the Moon Goddess statue. Papanoida's son, Ion, disregarded Divo as useless, and he and his father conducted another search, discovering the blood under the statue. Choosing to not inform the police of the found evidence, they pursued the matter on their own.<ref name=\"Sphere\" /> Similarly, during the interrogation of Halle Burtoni, Divo presented the results of a thorough investigation based on the evidence and information available to him. As he was not aware of all of the facts, however, Divo had drawn the wrong conclusions and had the incorrect person in custody instead of the true culprit, Lolo Purs.<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\nIn contrast, Divo demonstrated both his abilities as a detective by using his instinct and his ability to act decisively. When first beginning his investigation of the homicide of Farr, Divo felt that the murder was for personal reasons from Farr's past due to the fact that a poison, an intimate weapon preferred by politicians, had been used. Even though Divo did not care for politics and lacked the ability to skillfully maneuver the halls of power, he had a keen sense for motive. For though dismissed by the senators around him, Divo's initial theory turned out to be correct, as Purs had murdered Farr for his past mistakes and moral weakness. When Purs was revealed and took Amidala hostage, Divo proved that while he might have conducted slower investigations than others would have liked, he was also capable of taking quick and decisive action. Keeping calm and focused while everyone else was distracted, Divo activated the police droids who surprised Purs, allowing Amidala to free herself.<ref name=\"SM\" />\n\n[[File:HalleBurtoniArrested-SM.png|thumb|left|300px|Divo interrogates Halle Burtoni.]]\nAs a dedicated, by-the-book law officer, Divo believed that without rules, order could not exist. He continually emphasized this while investigating the homicides in the Senate. His confidence in knowing what was right and wrong and his strong belief in rules resulted in sometimes slow but methodical investigations. As the investigation continued, Divo displayed<ref name=\"SM\" /> both the calmness and cynicism of a typical Coruscant police officer,<ref name=\"SWTORCSFcodex\">{{TORcite|type=codex|Coruscant Security}}</ref><ref name=\"IC501\">''[[Imperial Commando: 501st]]''</ref> though this frustrated others such as Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who felt he did not instill confidence. In dealing with other persons, Divo did not aspire to be diplomatic. He voiced his opinion regardless of who was listening, including the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and was frequently sarcastic in his responses. After the incident at the docks, Amidala's suggestion that she felt she could ignore the rules floored Divo, and he lectured her sarcastically about what he saw as her ignorance. Though he had been written off as incompetent by Amidala, he disapproved of her own disregard for the rules and amateurish detective work, which alerted the murderer to a possible leak in Deechi that had to be closed by also killing him. Though others assumed his incompetence,<ref name=\"SM\" /> Divo's overall actions proved he was also underestimated.<ref name=\"Senate Murders Episode commentary\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n{{Quote|The 'Senate Murders' episode of ''The Clone Wars'' is unusual in that it almost seems like a ''Law & Order'' episode.
