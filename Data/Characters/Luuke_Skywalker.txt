Skywalker's hand and [[Anakin Skywalker's second lightsaber|lightsaber]] were recovered by Vader and taken to [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] [[Mount Tantiss/Legends|Mount Tantiss]] storehouse on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Wayland]]. In [[9 ABY/Legends|9 ABY]], the [[Clone madness|insane clone]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Joruus C'baoth]] performed a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] on [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[Grand Admiral/Legends|Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Thrawn's]] subordinate, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Gilad Pellaeon/Legends|Gilad Pellaeon]], ordering him to make a special clone for him. The clone that later became Luuke Skywalker was grown in secret from [[sample B-2332-54]], the sorting code assigned to Luke Skywalker's hand. The clone was grown in a [[Spaarti cloning cylinder]] over the period of less than a [[Standard month/Legends|month]]. When he was ready, the clone was given [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]] by C'baoth and over time became little more than an extension of C'baoth's will.\n\nC'baoth wished to turn Skywalker and the former [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hand]] [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]] over to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] and take them on as his [[Dark Jedi/Legends|apprentices]]. When they refused, C'baoth incapacitated Jade and unleashed the Luuke clone, determined to have at least one Skywalker serve him. The clone, wielding the [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] Skywalker lost in Cloud City, [[Assault on Mount Tantiss|faced off]] against Skywalker in the [[Emperor's throne room]] at Mount Tantiss. The clone's presence caused a buzzing pressure to form within Skywalker's mind, and Skywalker was constantly put on the defensive as the clone attacked with vicious thrusts of his lightsaber. The clone proved to have a similar proficiency in [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|lightsaber dueling]] and [[The Force/Legends|Force]] techniques as Skywalker, utilizing Force attacks such as [[Telekinesis/Legends|lightsaber throw]]. Eventually, Skywalker's sister, [[Leia Organa Solo]], entered the throne room but was quickly neutralized by C'baoth. As Skywalker continued to lose ground to the clone, Jade found an opportunity to recover Organa Solo's lightsaber. Jade was able to slip under the clone's guard and [[Death/Legends|kill]] him, and C'baoth was killed shortly thereafter. However, the entire experience went on to traumatize Skywalker in the days following.\n\n==Biography==\n===Creation===\n{{Quote|When the time is right, I will indeed return to Wayland.

Wielding the lightsaber you lost there.|Joruus C'baoth|The Last Command}}\n[[File:The_Last_Command_by_Chris_Scalf.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker prepares to duel his clone.]]\nThe clone's abilities were soon tested when C'baoth summoned him to the [[Emperor's throne room]] on Mount Tantiss, which had recently been infiltrated by the original Luke Skywalker, now a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], with the help of former [[Emperor's Hand/Legends|Emperor's Hand]] [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]]. When C'baoth realized he could not turn Skywalker to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], he struck Jade with [[Force lightning/Legends|Force lightning]] and introduced the clone. At C'baoth's command, the clone, dressed in a brown robe and concealed by the light of a [[Hologram/Legends|hologram]] next to him, unclipped a lightsaber from his [[Utility belt/Legends|belt]] and began moving toward Skywalker and Jade. The lightsaber the clone wielded was Skywalker's first, retrieved from Cloud City and stored at Mount Tantiss along with his hand. The clone's presence caused a buzzing pressure to form against Skywalker's mind and gave the Jedi a disturbing sense of familiarity. Skywalker was quickly reminded of his confrontation in the [[Dark Side Cave]] on [[Dagobah/Legends|Dagobah]] with the [[Dark Spirit]], a [[Force vision/Legends|Force manifestation]] of himself that he had [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|dueled]], and the clone Luuke finally revealed his face to the Jedi. Skywalker's mind froze in shock as he gazed upon a face that was his own, the buzzing pressure in his mind continuing to grow. C'baoth disclosed the clone's origins and claimed that whichever Skywalker defeated the other would be the one to serve him.<ref name=\"TLC\" />\n\nCatching Skywalker off guard, the clone ignited his lightsaber and began aggressively swinging his blade toward Skywalker's chest. As Skywalker attempted to block with his own lightsaber, the force of the clone's attack nearly threw the Jedi off balance. When Skywalker retreated to a raised guard platform at the lower level of the throne room, the clone followed through with a [[Telekinesis/Legends|lightsaber throw]], which sliced halfway through the platform, causing Skywalker to perform an unsuccessful backflip onto the ground. The clone retrieved his lightsaber and once more engaged Skywalker. He hurled his lightsaber at Skywalker when the Jedi [[Force Jump|leaped]] up to a nearby catwalk. The saber barely missed Skywalker but sliced through most of the catwalk and the support struts holding it to the ceiling. Skywalker attempted to [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-pull the clone's falling lightsaber to himself but was thwarted by C'baoth, who stopped the lightsaber in midair and insisted that [[Assault on Mount Tantiss|the duel]] be fought fairly. The clone had been standing still the whole time, knowing precisely what his master was doing. Skywalker threw his own lightsaber at the clone's, intending to destroy the clone's weapon. However, C'baoth intervened once again and threw an object at Skywalker, which caused the Jedi to miss and lose his mental grip on the clone's lightsaber. The clone recovered his lightsaber and raised it to an en guard position as a weary Skywalker prepared to continue the duel.<ref name=\"TLC\" />\n[[File:Maras_last_command.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The clone is slain by Mara Jade.]]\n\nSkywalker's sister, [[Leia Organa Solo]], along with her husband, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], and the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Talon Karrde]], found their way into the throne room during the battle. An attack from C'baoth left Organa Solo incapacitated, prompting Skywalker to aggressively attack his clone in a bid to finish the duel quickly and save his sister. The clone Luuke fell back before the onslaught, barely being able to block Skywalker's blows. The clone then retreated up a set of stairs to his master's side while Skywalker seemingly pursued him. Skywalker, however, switched his lightsaber off and attempted to bargain his own life with C'baoth for those of his comrades. As C'baoth conversed with Skywalker and Jade, the clone reignited his lightsaber and leaped toward Skywalker, who ignited his own weapon just in time to parry the clone's aerial attack. The clone drove Skywalker off the stairway and onto the floor below, and the two continued their fight on the lower level until Skywalker leaped back up to the main floor with the clone in pursuit. The clone then attacked Skywalker with vicious horizontal thrusts, slowly backing the Jedi against a wall. Jade managed to recover Organa Solo's lightsaber while C'baoth was distracted and charged at Skywalker's clone. The clone was aware of Jade's imminent attack but decided to take a gamble and finish off Skywalker first. As the clone swung his lightsaber for a finishing blow, Skywalker ducked, causing the clone's lightsaber to slice through a [[Viewscreen/Legends|viewscreen]] mounted on the rock wall behind Skywalker. The electronic components of the viewscreen exploded in the clone's face, and he shrieked, staggering backward. Dazed and angry, the clone raised his lightsaber in attack toward Jade. The former Emperor's Hand ducked and struck the clone with a killing strike, thus fulfilling the last command given to her by Palpatine: to kill Luke Skywalker.<ref name=\"TLC\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|Can something pure and noble be so easily twisted to evil and darkness?

He recorded his experience with his clone in a personal [[Datapad/Legends|datapad]] journal written several days after the confrontation. In it, he described his fears about his own future and how restless it left him. Skywalker compared the clone to the spirit he fought on Dagobah, describing how both adversaries had his own strengths and weaknesses and were his equals in almost every way. Skywalker was disturbed at the thought that a nearly exact duplicate of himself could become, in his mind, evil.

During the duel at Mount Tantiss, Skywalker found himself constantly matched by the clone. Their abilities were nearly equal, though the clone's presence caused a pressure to form in Skywalker's mind, giving the clone a slight advantage. The clone's lightsaber techniques utilized vicious, aggressive thrusts, and he was able to synchronize with C'baoth's mind, allowing him to carry out the Jedi Master's will instantly. The clone was adept in several telekinetic Force techniques, including Force jumping, pulling, and lightsaber throwing.<ref name=\"TLC\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nLuuke Skywalker was created by [[Timothy Zahn]] in [[1993]] for ''[[The Last Command]]'', the third and final novel in the [[Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy|''Thrawn Trilogy'']]. His background was expanded upon in ''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]'', written by [[Eric S. Trautmann]] and published in [[1994]]. The clone later made an appearance in the [[The Last Command 6|final issue]] of [[The Last Command (comics)|''The Last Command'' comic book adaptation]] in [[1998]].\n\nA slight discrepancy exists in the nature of the clone's death. ''The Last Command'' describes Mara Jade as striking the clone down with Leia Organa's lightsaber.<ref name=\"TLC\" /> However, the [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] adaptation of the novel depicts Jade [[Shiak|stabbing]] the clone through the chest.<ref name=\"TLC6\" />\n\n===\"An Apology\"===\n{{Quote|The confrontation at Mount Tantiss went off without a hitch, all the noise and smoke and confusion completely masking the fact that that crazy Jade woman nailed the wrong guy.|Luuke Skywalker, in \"An Apology\"|An Apology}}\nOn [[April 1]] [[2012]], Luuke Skywalker featured in \"[[An Apology]]\", a [[Canon|non-canon]] short story written by Timothy Zahn that was posted on the [[Random House]] genre website [http://suvudu.com Suvudu] as an [[Wikipedia:April Fools' Day|April Fools' Day]] joke. The story was presented as an epilogue to the [[Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi|''Fate of the Jedi'']] novel series and was recounted from the first-person perspective of Luuke, as an in-universe recollection of his life. According to the story, Luuke was secretly selected by Grand Admiral Thrawn to take Luke Skywalker's place among the New Republic hierarchy, and during Mara Jade's duel against Luuke on Mountain Tantiss in ''The Last Command'', the former Emperor's Hand inadvertently killed the real Luke Skywalker and Luuke subsequently took the Jedi's place, pretending that he was the original Luke.

Luuke went on to establish a [[new Jedi Order]] and founded a [[Jedi Praxeum|Jedi Academy]] on the moon [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]]. Thrawn requested that Luuke obtain tissue samples from<ref name=\"An Apology\" /> the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Force ghost|spirit]]<ref name=\"Dark Apprentice\">[[Dark Apprentice (novel)|''Dark Apprentice'']]</ref> [[Exar Kun/Legends|Exar Kun]] and<ref name=\"An Apology\" /> the unorthodox Jedi<ref name=\"No Prisoners\">''[[The Clone Wars: No Prisoners]]''</ref> [[Callista Ming|Callista]], and the clone failed to complete the task, although Luuke subsequently mollified the Grand Admiral by providing him with genetic samples from the [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lords]] [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Xizor/Legends|Xizor]] and [[Durga Besadii Tai|Durga the Hutt]]. According to ''An Apology'', Luuke later participated in the [[Black Fleet Crisis]] and the [[Caamas Document Crisis|conflict]] surrounding the rediscovery of the [[Caamas Document]], but the strains of war began to show on him and Thrawn considered replacing the Dark Jedi with a new clone. Over time, Thrawn gathered a collection of clones, and during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], Luuke came to suspect that the Admiral was insane. Thrawn also began substituting clones with their original progenitors, as he had with Luke and Luuke, then imprisoning the progenitors inside the Grand Admiral's [[Fortress/Legends|fortress]] in the [[Patagonia system]]. A replacement for Luuke, named [[Luuuke Skywalker]], was eventually created by Thrawn, and Luuke planned to go forth to [[Patagonia]], to accept his final fate.<ref name=\"An Apology\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[The Last Command]]'' {{1st}}\n*[[The Last Command (unabridged audiobook)|''The Last Command'' audiobook]]\n*[[The Last Command 1|''The Last Command'' 1]] {{Mo}}\n*[[The Last Command 6|''The Last Command'' 6]]\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Last Command Sourcebook|story=Mirror Image|stext=''Mirror Image''}} {{Flash}}\n*''[[Jedi Search]]'' {{Mo}}\n*[[Children of the Jedi (novel)|''Children of the Jedi'']] {{Mo}}\n*''[[Vision of the Future]]'' {{Imo}}\n*[[Vision of the Future (unabridged audiobook)|''Vision of the Future'' unabridged audiobook]] {{Imo}}\n*''[[The New Jedi Order: Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial]]'' {{Mo}}\n*\"[[An Apology]]\" {{Nc}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Scroll_box|content=\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The Last Command Sourcebook]]''\n*{{Topps|set=1995 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 3|cardname=Gary Gianni}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|Under ''Joruus C'baoth'', ''Mara Jade'', and ''Luke Skywalker''}}\n*''[[The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook]]''\n*{{GalaxyCite|13|So You Want To Be A Jedi...}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]'' {{C|Under ''Wayland''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''\n*{{InQuestCite|50|Star Wars Episode VII: Rise of the New Republic}} {{C|Non-[[canon]]ical source}}\n*[[The Essential Chronology (real-world book)|''The Essential Chronology'']] {{C|Under ''The Katana Fleet and the Clone Troopers''}}\n*''[[A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded]]''\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]'' {{C|Under ''Mara Jade Skywalker''}}\n*{{FFCite|27|MAR4, ''Mara Jade Skywalker''}}\n*{{InsiderCite|67|Ask Lobot|Star Wars Q&A}}\n*{{FFCite|86|CBA4, ''Joruus C'Baoth''}}\n*{{FFCite|107|THR6, ''The Thrawn Campaign''}}\n*{{FFCite|115|SKY42, ''Luke Skywalker''}}\n*{{WizardsCite|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050609a|text=The Dark Forces Saga, Part 5|int=The Dark Forces Saga|archivedate=20100217120457}}\n*{{InsiderCite|83|20 Most Memorable Moments of the Expanded Universe}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]'' {{C|Under ''The Death of Thrawn''}}\n*''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' {{C|Under ''The Katana Fleet and the Clone Troopers''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Comics Companion]]'' {{C|Under ''The Last Command''}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide: Special Edition]]'' {{C|Under ''The Death of Thrawn''}}\n*[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']] {{C|Under ''Illustrious Lightsabers''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n*''[[Jedi Academy Training Manual]]'' {{Imo}}\n*{{DB|character|joruuscbaoth|Joruus C'baoth|archivedate=20110824162026}}\n*{{DB|character|lukeskywalker|Skywalker, Luke|archivedate=20110807050620}}\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n*{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Black Series|pack=Luke Skywalker &amp; Ysalamiri|altlink=https://www.gamestop.com/toys-collectibles/collectibles/figures/products/star-wars-luke-skywalker-with-ysalamiri-the-black-series-lucasfilm-50th-anniversary-action-figure/11113850.html|archiveurl=https://archive.vn/OvFzN}} {{Imo}}}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Luuke Skywalker#legends\n|es=Luuke Skywalker\n|hu=Luuke Skywalker\n|pl=Luuke Skywalker\n|pt=Luuke Skywalker\n|ru=\u041b\u044e\u044e\u043a \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0439\u0443\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skywalker, Luuke}}\n[[Category:Dark Jedi]]\n[[Category:Human clones]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Skywalker family]]\n[[Category:Wayland residents]]"}}}]}}}}
