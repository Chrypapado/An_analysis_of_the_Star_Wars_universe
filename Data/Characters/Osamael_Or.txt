Among a group of [[Tythan]]s that identified as Frontiersmen, Or was active during an era where [[Force Storm (Tython)|Force Storms]] ravaged the planet and occasionally swept away [[Je'daii]] and the non-Forceful family and fellow settlers they shared the world with. While many Frontiersmen sought to go beyond Tython and seek the stars, Or believed that distance did not make a difference in terms of a worthy destination. Detractors among the Tythans argued with Or, claiming that there were more worthy pursuits that could help their society than digging into ancient ruins. Many began to believe that Or was mad, driven from sanity by his obsessions. By the time of his last expedition, Or could not rally anyone to accompany him, as all allies had turned their back on him.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" /> \n\nDuring his explorations through the [[Red Desert]] on the continent of [[Talss]], he journeyed to the [[Old City (Tython)|Old City]] and delved deep beneath the surface of the city into the labyrinthine structures that went far below the ground level. Or never returned to the Je'daii or his peers among the Tythans, and concerns for his safety began to escalate. After Or was established as missing, his family felt a responsibility to search for him. They ventured into the Old City, but all involved refused to delve deeply. By the end of the search, only his sister believed that Or was still alive somewhere in the depths, claiming that one day he would emerge with amazing knowledge.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" /> \n\n===Legacy===\n{{Quote|He's still exploring down there, in those depths. He's going deeper, and finding more, and one day he'll emerge with news that will astound us all.|Osamael Or's sister about him|Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void}}While his family never learned the truth, Or's existence faded into myth and legend, passed down as a cautionary tale to young Je'daii about wandering too far into the dark places. Or did in fact survive and went on to record his findings in a diary. A simple journal of paper and card, he titled his work ''[[The Gree, and Everything I Have Found of Them in the Old City]]''. Deep in the bowels of the Old City, Or described [[Gree (species)/Legends|Gree]] culture and [[Gree technology]] far more advanced than anything in possession of the Tythans. These diaries would later fall into the possession of the [[Kalimahr|Kalimahri]] industrialist [[Kara (Je'daii)|Kara]], who kept the leather-bound book in a [[Gazz Spire|secret collection]] of ancient artifacts. Within the text, written in a script unfamiliar to Je'daii nine thousand years after Or's life, Or described what was described as a [[Gree device|device]] that was powered by [[Dark matter/Legends|dark matter]], which was translated as a [[Hypergate|'step to the stars']]. When a [[Stargazer Uprising|plot to activate the gate]] was discovered by the [[Je'daii Council]], [[Je'daii Ranger]] [[Lanoree Brock]] broke into Kara's apartment and took possession of the diary. After Brock read it, she thought that there must have been more written within other diaries, as it was incomplete. Indeed, [[Dalien Brock]] and the [[Stargazers (sect)|Stargazers]] had latched onto Or's legendary findings and began to work in earnest to leave Tython though the construction of a [[Dark matter/Legends|dark matter]] device to activate the hypergate rumored to be under the Old City. Despite their success in creating a device, the Stargazers were defeated by Je'daii Brock, who killed their leader and took custody of the device.<ref name=\"Into the Void\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void]]'' {{1stm|[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void (audiobook)|''Dawn of the Jedi: Into the Void'' audiobook]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fr=Osamael Or\n|ru=\u041e\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044d\u043b\u044c \u041e\u0440\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Or, Osamael}}\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Scouts]]\n[[Category:Tythans]]"}}}]}}}}
