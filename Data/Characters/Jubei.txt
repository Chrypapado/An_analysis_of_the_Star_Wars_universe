When [[Meetra Surik]] arrived on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], Jubei, Gonlo, and Saquesh were all [[Death/Legends|killed]] when Saquesh refused Surik's request to leave the refugees that he oversaw alone.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf the Exile has a high enough persuasion, she can convince Saquesh to give the refugees more space by claiming that one of the refugees, [[Geriel]], has a contagious illness. This is a bluff, since in fact the Exile cures Geriel. In this instance, neither Jubei, Gonlo or Saquesh are killed.\n\nIf the Exile chooses to have the refugee Geriel killed by the [[Exchange]] for his illness, Saquesh will order Jubei to take care of it.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Exchange members]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Weequays]]"}}}]}}}}
