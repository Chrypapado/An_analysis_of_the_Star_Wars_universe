During the Cold War, he was contacted by the [[Bith/Legends|Bith]] [[Detective/Legends|detective]] [[Dooce Everton]], who was investigating who was leading Black Sun on Coruscant.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\nEverton convinced Lobacc to become his informant, and Lobacc began to secretly gather information on the gang for the Bith. But when Everton asked for his information, Deringon refused to meet anywhere except for the [[Silent Sun cantina]] deep in Black Sun territory. As Everton was known in the area and could not come himself, a traveling hero got Lobacc's information from him and gave it to Everton.<ref name=\"TOR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDeringon Lobacc appears in the [[BioWare]] MMORPG ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', as the target of the mission \"The Pickup\" on Coruscant. Lobacc is a Human, but is identified as a [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] in the mission log for \"The Pickup.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Deringon Lobacc\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lobacc, Deringon}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
