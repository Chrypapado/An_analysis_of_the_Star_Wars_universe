His squad found the group of people looking for [[Darin]] after they crashed in the rain forest and escorted them safely to the Cartel base.

He followed orders to the letter, and was reluctant to give out information as he did not believe it was his place to do so. He was a pawn in the organization, and was not aware of [[Velin Wir]]'s illegal actions. As far as he could discern, the Cartel had tried not to disrupt the balance of Cularin's forests more than was necessary.<ref name=\"ACP\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[A Cularin Presence]]'' {{1st}}\n*''[[Tilnes Rising]]''\n*''[[Excursion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Caarites]]\n[[Category:Cularin residents]]\n[[Category:Guards]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Metatheran Cartel members]]"}}}]}}}}
