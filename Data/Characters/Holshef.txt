Never underestimate the power of poetry.|Holshef, to Merei Spanjaf|Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice}}\n'''Holshef''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Lothalite|native]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories]] [[planet]] [[Lothal]]. Although he had a great love for his [[homeworld]], Holshef was disturbed by its slow ruination by the [[Galactic Empire]]. By [[4 BBY]], he was an old man with wispy [[Color|white]] [[hair]] who [[Artist|painted]] and wrote [[poet]]ry. His artistic expressions against the Empire's actions on Lothal resulted in an arrest warrant and forced him into [[Refugee|hiding]]. He paid [[credit]]s to [[Yahenna Laxo]] of the [[Gray Syndicate]] to stay safe from Imperial attention.\n\nAs [[Spectres|rebellious]] activities increased on Lothal, the Empire also increased its efforts in corralling the planet's criminal underworld, and few elements escaped attention. The Empire targeted the Gray Syndicate's [[gambling]] operations and warehouses, before finally accomplishing the Syndicate's near total destruction by [[Assault on the Gray Syndicate|raiding]] its [[Ake's Tavern|headquarters]] and [[Death|killing]] Laxo. Her death left Holshef in danger, as there remained an Imperial [[bounty]] issued for the old man's capture. Thus, [[Merei Spanjaf]], a human female who had come to know and like Holshef through her activities with the Syndicate, sought to spirit him off Lothal.\n\nWith the Empire further tightening its grip, Spanjaf eventually removed the artist from his [[1044 Chapel|place of hiding]] in a hasty and risky plan to escape. Holshef loathed giving up the only planet he had ever known, but Spanjaf convinced him that nothing good could result from his remaining. By then, the two were directly targeted by a dangerous [[Unidentified bounty hunter (Lothal)|bounty hunter]], though a wild chase left the [[Bounty hunter|hunter]] dead, and Holshef escaped the planet with the help of a [[cantina]] owner known as [[Jho|Old Jho]] and was dropped off on the planet [[Garel]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n{{Quote|Did you ever taste the greel-wood syrup from Far Hiradne?''\"<br />\"''My first job was as an apprentice sap collector there.''\"<br />\"''I have a bottle of vintage Hiradne syrup in the back.|Old Jho and Holshef|Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy}}\n[[File:Lothal_FDNP.png|thumb|right|180px|Holshef loved his home planet, Lothal.]]\nHolshef was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] who [[Lothalite|lived]] on the<ref name=\"secret\" /> [[Outer Rim Territories]]<ref name=\"datalothal\">{{Databank|lothal|Lothal|archivedate=20200319202640}}</ref> [[planet]] [[Lothal]] under the [[Galactic Republic]] and later its successor, the [[Galactic Empire]]. His [[Holshef's grandmother|grandmother]] had come to the planet as a young woman and built the family home in [[Capital City]].<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nIn his youth, Holshef's first job was as an apprentice [[sap collector]], gathering [[sap]] to make [[greel-wood syrup]] from the [[Greel-wood|trees]] of the [[Far Hiradne]] region of Lothal. He also spent [[time]] in his youth at the reliquary of a saint. When the Empire first [[Occupation of Lothal|annexed Lothal]]<ref name=\"secret\" /> in approximately [[19 BBY]],<ref name=\"thesteal\">During the events of ''[[Adventures in Wild Space: The Steal]]'', [[Ezra Bridger]] is an [[Youngling|infant]].

Furthermore, in ''The Steal'', [[CR-8R]] states that [[Lothal]] invited in the [[Galactic Empire]] \"three [[Standard month|months]] ago,\" thereby providing an approximate date of 19 [[Galactic standard calendar|BBY]] for the Imperial annexation of Lothal.</ref> Holshef and his family threw a party because they felt the Empire could unify [[the galaxy]] in a better way than the Republic ever could.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\n===A fugitive artist===\n{{Quote|There's so much the Empire could do to bind the galaxy together, to create a more perfect union of worlds the way the Republic never could. But what has it done instead? Poisoned Lothal's air and water, when protecting them would have only cost a few percentage points of profit. I thought that was wrong, and I thought surely someone in the Empire would understand it was wrong. I thought if I pointed it out, someone would stop it.|Holshef|Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice}}\n[[File:Polluted_Lothal.png|thumb|left|200px|The Lothal Holshef loved was eventually strip-mined and polluted.]]\nHolshef eventually learned that the Empire was strip-[[mining]] the planet and rapidly destroying its [[forest]]s to build heavy industry.<ref name=\"justice\" /> He was upset that the Empire was [[poison]]ing Lothal's [[Atmosphere|air]] and [[water]] when it could have been prevented<ref name=\"secret\" /> by using less aggressive methods, such as making use of the local workforce instead of relying on crude [[harvester droid]]s.<ref name=\"edge\">''[[Servants of the Empire: Edge of the Galaxy]]''</ref> As a result, Holshef [[Poet|wrote poems]] and [[Artist|painted pictures]] to express his objections but only ended up with an arrest warrant and a [[bounty]] for his capture issued against him for his trouble,<ref name=\"justice\" /> as the Empire was cracking down on all dissent and nostalgia on the planet under a directive code-named [[Operation Guiding Light]].<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nThe artist thought about going to see [[Arihnda Pryce]], [[Governor]] of Lothal, regarding his concerns, thinking she would understand, but was told by his [[Holshef's daughter|daughter]] that it was a bad idea. As such, Holshef was forced into [[Refugee|hiding]], paying [[credit]]s to [[Yahenna Laxo]] of the [[Gray Syndicate]], a small-time criminal outfit and protectorate based on Lothal, in return for keeping him safe. His misdeeds against the Empire were different from most of the other individuals being sheltered by Laxo, such as [[Apapaba]], [[Durchine]], [[Kinlo]], [[Marhas]], and [[Pinson]], who generally fell into the category of [[gambling]] debts or other self-inflicted trouble.<ref name=\"justice\" />\n\n===A new friend===\n{{Quote|But it's nice to see a friendly face. I'll paint you a picture&mdash;don't worry, it won't be anything that might get you in trouble, too.

Given that ''Galactic Atlas'' dates ''The Siege of Lothal'' to 4 [[Galactic standard calendar|BBY]] as well, the events of ''Imperial Justice'' must also take place in that [[Standard year|year]].</ref> Holshef would sometimes be visited in his hiding place by [[Merei Spanjaf]]. A teenage human girl with [[Slicer|slicing]] skills, Spanjaf had been investigating the Empire's capture of her [[Zare Leonis|boyfriend's]] older sister, [[Dhara Leonis]], and had been drawn into the Gray Syndicate's activities due to needing a [[snooper]] program for her investigations. As part of Spanjaf's duties for the Gray Syndicate, she would collect Holshef's credits and give them to Laxo. During their meetings, Holshef would offer the girl [[tarine tea]] and ask her to describe the [[color]] of the [[grass]] or the [[Lothal (star)|sunset]] outside, and she found him to be terribly lonely. Spanjaf empathized with the old man's complaints about the Empire, and he found her to be a friendly face, promising to paint the girl a picture, though nothing that would get her in trouble by upsetting the Empire.<ref name=\"justice\" />\n\n[[File:Merei_Spanjaf.png|thumb|right|200px|Merei Spanjaf helped Holshef escape Imperial persecution.]]\nAs part of her continued duties, Spanjaf once visited Holshef to inform him that [[Rosey]], also of the Gray Syndicate, would be moving him to a new hiding place in order to ensure his continued protection from the Empire. At some point after that, Laxo sold the details of Holshef's location to a [[Unidentified bounty hunter (Lothal)|bounty hunter]] and assigned Spanjaf to take the [[Bounty hunter|hunter]] to Holshef's newest hideout in [[1044 Chapel]], a warehouse building in the industrial quarter of Capital City. Spanjaf's orders were to wait as the hunter collected the Empire's bounty on Holshef, a portion of which would go to Laxo.<ref name=\"justice\" />\n\nHowever, [[Ake's Tavern]], the Syndicate's headquarters, was soon caught in a [[Assault on the Gray Syndicate|raid]] orchestrated by Spanjaf herself and carried out by Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s. The raid left Laxo [[Death|dead]] and Spanjaf seemingly free of his and the Syndicate's influence, as the Empire believed the girl to be an innocent civilian who had been taken hostage in order to stop an investigation being conducted by her [[Jessa Spanjaf|mother]]. Nevertheless, Holshef remained a wanted man, and his former protectors whom he had been paying were now dead.<ref name=\"justice\" />\n\n===A need to escape===\n{{Quote|Living the rest of my life without the sound of the wind in the grasslands? Or the sight of thunderheads rolling in over the mountains?''\"<br />\"''Holshef, you have to listen to me. If you stay here you'll never see or hear those things again. They'll put you in a cell and all you'll see is metal. And all you'll hear is machines.|Holshef and Merei Spanjaf|Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy}}\nFollowing the assault, Spanjaf wondered what had become of Holshef. As soon as she was in a position to do so, she visited the warehouse where she was told the old man was being kept. Upon arrival, Spanjaf spoke with a [[Unidentified Lutrillian warehouse manager|whiskered Lutrillian]], who warned her that he had not received Holshef's credits and that, as a result, the fugitive would not be able to stay. She told the [[Lutrillian]] that alternative arrangements were being made and gave him enough credits to cover the [[Standard week|week]], plus a little extra, telling him to only deal with her regarding Holshef's situation.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\n[[File:Capital_City_by_night.png|thumb|left|200px|Capital City, Holshef's home and later hiding place]]\nUpon seeing Spanjaf, Holshef greeted her cheerily, saying that he had forgotten her name, but she reminded him that she had never revealed it to him, as that would have been too dangerous. The old Lothalian was amused by the intrigue and pleased at the idea that he would be moved within the week, as he would have a chance to see the [[Star|sun]] and enjoy early [[spring]], though Spanjaf lamented that it was still [[Temperature|cold]]. Both commiserated over no longer being able to enjoy the smell of the [[Jogan fruit|jogan]] blossoms, and, as Spanjaf's [[eye]]s [[water]]ed at thoughts of time past, he offered to read her poetry about Lothal's fragrances in the time of his youth. Overwhelmed, the girl fled for the stairs, reminding Holshef again that he would be moved soon.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nSpanjaf continuously fretted over the problem of Holshef. She finally reached the conclusion that there was no safety for him unless she moved him off Lothal and began making inquiries as to how this might be effected.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\n===Hatching a plan===\n{{Quote|I have a friend who needs a ticket off Lothal. One that won't require proper ID.''\"<br />\"''Not easy to do these days&mdash;what with the blockade and all the trouble.''\"<br />\"''Even if it's life or death?|Merei Spanjaf and Old Jho|Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy}}\nSpanjaf realized that she would not be able to get Holshef off Lothal via the [[Capital City spaceport|spaceport]]. She returned to the warehouse to find the Lutrillian manager in a state of near panic about the recent Imperial crackdowns. The girl was able to give him enough credits to cover ten more [[Standard day|days]], but he warned her that Holshef could not stay any longer than that.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\n[[File:Jho_Crop.png|thumb|right|200px|The Ithorian Old Jho played a role in Holshef's rescue and in the process took a liking to the old man.]]\nSpanjaf decided to visit [[Jho|Old Jho]], a contact she had met during her time working with the Gray Syndicate. She told him about Holshef, and he asked her what it was that Holshef did to anger the Empire. The girl showed Jho some of Holshef's poetry, causing him to reminisce about the [[spine tree]]s in the [[Tree|forests]] of [[Pelamir Gorge]], which had been cut down by the Empire. He told Spanjaf that he had people who owed him a favor and to be there with her friend and credits in six days.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nHolshef was visited by Spanjaf four days later, and he presented her with an unexpected problem. The artist simply did not want to leave, as Lothal had been his home for all his life. Though Spanjaf sympathized with the old man's plight, she helped him to understand that he would be of no help to anyone if he was locked up on Lothal and that he still had a chance to help the rest of the [[galaxy]]. Spanjaf's words seemed to strike something within Holshef, and he noted that she still had not told him her name. When she finally did, in barely a whisper, he agreed to go, then sobbed for what he had lost and was about to lose.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\n===Sudden flight===\n{{Quote|Listen to me. We're in danger. We're going to go as fast as we can without getting stopped by a patrol. And if a patrol does try to stop us, we're going to have to go a lot faster than that. So I need you to do two things. First, ''shut up.'' Second, hold on tighter than you've ever held on before.|Merei Spanjaf, to Holshef|Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy}}\nSpanjaf soon discovered that there was much more at stake than Holshef. Her deceptions were finally catching up with her, as the Empire had arrested [[Hestia Tarleton]], a girl whose photo had been used a stand-in for Spanjaf. The girl knew that she had [[Standard hour|hours]] at most before the Imperials learned that Tarleton was not the person they were looking for. Spanjaf contacted her family, told them to meet her, and then went immediately to Holshef, informing him that they were leaving right away. Holshef tried to gather stacks of poetry, a [[Standard year|year's]] worth of poems, only for her to cut him off at one week.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nWhat followed for Holshef was a wild ride on a [[Speeder bike|jumpspeeder]] like the old man had never experienced in his life. The two nearly made it to [[Old Jho's Pit Stop|Old Jho's]] when they were almost [[Blaster|blasted]] off the bike. A chase ensued as Spanjaf saw that the individual pursuing them was the bounty hunter who had previously been after Holshef. As the chase continued, Holshef's bag of poetry [[paper]]s slipped, and one of them flew away in the wind, covering the face of the bounty hunter and causing him to crash into a [[droid truck]]. As the truck exploded, the two made their escape while Holshef mused that one should \"never underestimate the power of poetry.\"<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\n===Leaving Lothal===\n{{Quote|Where's Holshef?''\"<br />\"''Mooning over wildflowers with your friend Jho.|Merei Spanjaf and her father|Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy}}\n[[File:Garel.png|thumb|left|200px|Holshef escaped to the planet Garel.]]\nThe two arrived at Old Jho's, where Holshef discussed his and Spanjaf's thrilling exploits, and later Lothal's history, with Jho. The two established quite a rapport while Spanjaf confessed the truth of her activities to her [[parent]]s. That night, the group slept together in a storeroom, and the next morning Spanjaf awoke to find Holshef absent, though her [[Gandr Spanjaf|father]] told her that the old man was out mooning over [[Flower|wildflowers]] with Jho.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nSpanjaf later found Holshef scribbling with a [[stylus]] as she received an important [[Comlink|comm]] message from a group of old friends she knew as the [[Spectres]]. Spanjaf's group was to meet up with the Spectres at the edge of the [[Garel system]] after Jho brought them there. However, shortly after receiving the transmission, Spanjaf learned that her boyfriend, Zare Leonis, was scheduled for execution by the Empire, and the group was forced to depart from Lothal in a hurry as a result.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nSpanjaf left Holshef with Jho, joined up with her parents, and then picked up Leonis's parents. Evading pursuit by the Empire, the entire group then left Lothal on [[Jho's freight hauler]]. Spanjaf was delivered to a rendezvous with the Spectres, while Holshef was dropped off on [[Garel]],<ref name=\"secret\" /> a planet in the [[Lothal sector]]<ref name=\"Ultimate Star Wars\">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> that, like Lothal, was ostensibly under the Empire's control but had not been so oppressed, making it a suitable place of refuge.<ref name=\"Droids in Distress\">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|When I smell jogan I'm sixteen again.

He enjoyed the planet's bountiful nature prior to its ruination by the Empire, including the lush forests and subtle changing of the seasons. The old man could be transported to memories of youth by the smell of the planet's jogan blossoms. Fond of the fragrances of Lothal in his youth, he devoted an entire small [[book]] of poems to the topic.<ref name=\"secret\" />\n\nThe Lothalian wished to share his poetry with as many people as possible and was very protective of it. Even knowing his own life was in danger, Holshef clung to his sheaves of paper, abandoning a year's worth of work only very reluctantly.
