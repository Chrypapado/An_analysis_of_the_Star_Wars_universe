Working inside the [[Tomb of Tulak Hord|tomb]] of [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Tulak Hord]], Zell longed to uncover the secrets of Hord's ancient [[Red Engine]], a machine of untold power. According with Zell, Tulak Hord's tomb was build with exact specification provided by Hord himself to hold the Red Engine. While most scholars at the nearby [[Sith Academy (Korriban)|Sith Academy]] believed the machine to be incomplete, Zell had evidence that those Sith who had tried to activate it had failed to fully understand the mystery of the engine. While Zell was not an educated man, he believed that the machine needed blood of the tomb's beasts and the hatred of a true Sith to activate the machine. When a passing [[Sith Acolyte]] agreed to undertake Zell's challenge of venturing into the tomb and turning on the machine, Zell was eventually proven right when the Acolyte returned with the hidden teachings from the machine.<ref name=\"SWTOR\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Ephran Zell#legends\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zell, Ephran}}\n[[Category:Archaeologists]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Korriban residents]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sith Empire individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
