[[Iella Wessiri Antilles|Iella Wessiri]] worked with her father for a [[Standard year/Legends|year]], presumably in [[Corellian Security Force|CorSec]]. She was blonde, well-muscled, as tall as Wedge Antilles, and in her mid-twenties as of [[40 ABY]].\n\nIt turns out that it was a trap, and Barthis was simply trying to get Wedge away from [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] during the GA's attack on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Wedge managed to escape, and shot her with Titch's blaster. Due to the failure of the mission to keep Wedge in custody, she was demoted from her previous rank of [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] to [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]].\n\nLater, Barthis was present at [[Toryaz Station]] during the meeting between Corellian and GA delegates. She danced with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Legacy of the Force: Betrayal]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Elsen Barthis\n|pl=Elsen Barthis\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barthis, Elsen}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Galactic Alliance Intelligence personnel]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
