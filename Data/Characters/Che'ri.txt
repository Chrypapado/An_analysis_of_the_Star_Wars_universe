The battle over [[Primea]] was portrayed in ''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'', which took place in [[19 BBY]] per the reasoning [[Template:ChaosRisingDate|here]]. ''Greater Good'' took place around [[18 BBY]] per the reasoning [[Template:GreaterGoodDate|here]]. Therefore, Che'ri must have had her tenth star day between those two [[Standard year|years]]. A star day celebrated a Chiss' first sight of the stars, which required them to already be born.

She liked to draw on her [[Questis data-link reader|Questis]] and later with [[color]]ed [[graph marker]]s. She often drew pictures of birds, [[Flashfly|flashflies]], and scenery as seen from above, as she had always dreamed of flying.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" /> Che'ri often had nightmares, which was typical of Sky-walkers.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\n==Biography==\nChe'ri was born around [[29 BBY]].<ref name=\"Birth date\" /> At a young age, she was determined to have [[Precognition|Third Sight]], and was made part of the [[Sky-walker corps|Chiss Sky-walker corps]].<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nShe served on multiple ships, with multiple caregivers, until she fell under service to Mitth'raw'nuruodo aboard his ship, the ''[[Springhawk]].'' Her caregiver aboard the ''Springhawk'' was Mitth'ali'astov, known by the core name Thalias. While under service of Thrawn, she guided the ship through many systems within [[Unknown Regions|the Chaos]], including one quaternary star system that nearly gave Che'ri sensory overload.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nShe later served as a [[pilot]] on Thrawn's ship during his [[Mission to Batuu (Clone Wars)|missions]] to [[Batuu]] and [[Mokivj]]. During an [[Mission to Mokivj|assault]] on a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[Mokivj droid factory|droid factory]] she launched decoys in order to land within the [[factory]] and help Thrawn retrieve the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] that had been protecting the factory.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nShe also aided Thrawn by pretending to be a [[Chiss family hostage]] alongside her Momish, Thalias. They were able to deceive [[Yiv]], leading to his capture.<ref name=\"Chaos Rising\" />\n\nChe'ri played a pivotal role in preventing a [[Plot to destroy the Chiss Ascendancy|scheme to cause a civil war]] among the Chiss from coming to fruition. At the [[skirmish above Hoxim]], Che'ri used her powers of Third Sight to guide the hands of [[weapons officer]] [[Chaf'pri'uhme|Afpriuh]] to aim the ''Springhawk''{{'s}} weapons. Che'ri and Afpriuh aimed at the commandeered [[Watith]] [[freighter]] ''[[Saltbarrel]]'' at the exact angle needed to destroy the fake [[Unidentified settlement (Agbui)|Agbui nyix mine]] and make it look accidental. As a result, the [[Great Families]] could not fight over the fake nyix deposit, believing it destroyed.<ref name=\"Greater Good\">''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising]]'' {{1st}} {{1stID|Che'ri|[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good]]''\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil]]''\n*[[Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil (audiobook)|''Thrawn Ascendancy: Lesser Evil'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]'' {{1stm|[[Thrawn: Alliances (audiobook)|''Thrawn: Alliances'' audiobook]]}}\n*[[Thrawn: Alliances (audiobook)|''Thrawn: Alliances'' audiobook]] {{Mo}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Twitter|DelReyStarWars|status/1291057824479547394|[[Del Rey]]|quote=When the #ThrawnAscendancy trilogy begins, you'll be going beyond the galaxy far, far away.... into a new world of stories.
