He was an experienced [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]] who [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] encountered in [[Anchorhead/Legends|Anchorhead]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] in [[3956 BBY]]. Revan defeated Nellis in three games of pazaak, each one with higher stakes, and with Nellis using a more advanced deck than the one before. Eventually, Furko Nellis gave up on betting against Revan, claiming it was an insult to bet against such a good pazaak player. However, Nellis was still willing to play against Revan, without betting.\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nThe 'skin' used for Furko Nellis is the exact same as one of the male Revans.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|fi=Furko Nellis\n|pl=Furko Nellis\n|ru=\u0424\u0443\u0440\u043a\u043e \u041d\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0441\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nellis, Furko}}\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
