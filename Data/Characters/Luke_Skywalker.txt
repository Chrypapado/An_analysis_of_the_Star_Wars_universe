Along with his companions, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] and [[General]] [[Han Solo]], Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]&mdash;an organization committed to the downfall of the [[The galaxy|Galactic]] [[Politics#Empire|Empire]] and the restoration of [[democracy]]. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest [[Jedi]] in [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]].\n\nThe son of [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], Luke Skywalker was [[Reproduction|born]] along with his [[twin]] sister, Leia, in [[19 BBY]]. As a result of Amidala's [[death]] and Anakin's fall to the [[dark side of the Force]], the Skywalker [[Youngling|children]] were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the [[House of Organa|royal family]] of [[Alderaan]] while Luke was raised by his [[Lars family|relatives]] on [[Tatooine]]. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of [[the Force]] under the guidance of Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], whose first [[Padawan|apprentice]] was Luke's own [[Parent|father]]. During the [[Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY]], Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's [[planet]]-killing [[superweapon]], the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]]. He continued his [[Jedi training|training]] in the [[Standard year|years]] that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]]. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], during which he confronted the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader, whom he [[Duel on Cloud City|learned]] was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the [[light side of the Force]] by killing [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious]] at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the [[Chosen One]]. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice on [[Ajan Kloss]], but Leia ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her knighthood.\n\nWith the [[Sith]]'s destruction and the subsequent [[Galactic Concordance|capitulation]] of the Empire in [[5 ABY]], Luke Skywalker traveled across the [[galaxy]], searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the [[Jedi Order]]. One of his apprentices was his sister's son, [[Ben Solo]], who inherited the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker bloodline's]] raw strength and potential for limitless power. As master and padawan, Skywalker traveled with his nephew and battle the knights of Ren, studied lost Jedi lore, and gathered others to expand their new order's ranks. In [[28 ABY]], Skywalker, glimpsing the darkness in his padawan, briefly contemplated murdering him, causing Solo to fall to the dark side like Vader before him and destroy his nascent order. The loss of his nephew haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. In addition, the [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destruction]] of his temple and murder of all his students convinced him that the [[time]] had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on the [[Unknown Regions|distant]] world of [[Ahch-To]], having elected to live out his remaining [[Standard day|days]] as a [[hermit]] despite the galaxy's pleas for help during the [[Cold War|rise]] of the [[First Order]].\n\nHis solitude was interrupted in [[34 ABY]], shortly after the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|fall]] of the [[New Republic]], resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play [[Battle of Crait|one last, momentous role]] in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he [[Force spirit|passed away into the Force]], his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the [[Jakku]] [[scavenger]] known as [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]].\n\nIn [[35 ABY]], Skywalker's spirit communed with Rey during the final days of the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]]. The Jedi apprentice had exiled herself to Ahch-To, following in Skywalker's example. However, Skywalker urged Rey to [[Battle of Exegol|confront]] her [[Palpatine family|grandfather]], the [[Cloning|resurrected]] Darth Sidious. Believing he had been wrong, Skywalker told Rey that a Jedi's destiny was to confront fear. Following the Emperor's destruction, the spirits of Skywalker and his sister watched over Rey as she buried their lightsabers in Skywalker's [[Lars Homestead|childhood home]] on Tatooine and adopted the Skywalker name as her own to honor their legacy.\n\n==Biography==\n===Pre-birth===\n{{Quote|He is to teach one that will save the universe from a great imbalance.|Serenity, concerning Yoda's future training of Luke Skywalker|Destiny (episode)}}\n[[File:Epguide612.png|thumb|left|238x238px|During Yoda's training, the Force Priestesses prophesied the coming of another Skywalker.]]\nDuring the [[Clone Wars]], [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]] set out on a journey to discover the secrets of [[Force spirit|immortality]].

Luke did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving several of them at his grandmother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi's]] sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as Luke played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the [[farm]]. Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been watching Luke from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by one of the gang, Luke threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the Gammorean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further, slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included uncle Owen, who managed to gun down several of the invaders with a blaster. Luke cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a [[Devaronian]], had snuck up behind Owen, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last marauder in half. As Luke cheered, Owen threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Owen then ushered Luke back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that Luke's brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy's future.<ref name=\"Time of Death\">{{Shortstory|story=Time of Death|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\n====Vader's vision====\nShortly after the [[Battle of Fortress Vader]], Darth Vader accessed a [[portal]] to the dark side created by [[Darth Momin]] in an attempt to revive Padm\u00e9. He eventually found an apparition of Padm\u00e9 standing on a balcony, who rejected his pleas and threw itself off the ledge and was incinerated by lightning. Just after this, Vader saw a blue light in the distance, out of which emerged an apparition of an adult Luke, who blasted him back to reality.<ref name=\"Dark Lord 25\">[[Darth Vader (2017) 25|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 25]]</ref>\n\n====Taking on Jabba's thugs====\n{{Quote|That right kid?

One of them became startled and pushed Skywalker to the ground, causing him to hit his head and pass out. Once Kenobi handled the thugs, he carried Skywalker to the Lars' homestead where he was found asleep, unaware of his savior's identity, by his aunt in the morning.<ref name=\"SW7\">[[Star Wars (2015) 7|''Star Wars'' (2015) 7]]</ref>\n\n====Saving Uncle Owen====\n{{Quote|Hang on, Uncle Owen!|Luke Skywalker after rescuing his uncle.|Star Wars (2015) 20}}\n[[File:Owen-and-Luke.png|thumb|right|300px|Safe from the bounty hunter, Lars is reunited with Skywalker.]]\nA year after the Great Drought, life carried on for Luke on Tatooine. Alongside [[Biggs Darklighter]] and his other friends, Luke flew his [[T-16 skyhopper]] for a joyride through [[Beggar's Canyon]]. Despite some daring moves, Skywalker ended up crashing the vehicle, leading to his uncle Owen grounding him. Luke offered to pay for the damage by flying in a race at nearby Anchorhead, but Lars stood his ground. Unbeknowst to both of them, Obi-Wan Kenobi used [[Jawa]]s to leave Luke some skyhopper parts. An angry Owen returned the parts to Kenobi and told him to leave the family alone.<ref name=\"SW15\">[[Star Wars (2015) 15|''Star Wars'' (2015) 15]]</ref>\n\nSome time after grounding Luke from flying his skyhopper, Lars attempted to rebuild his relationship with his nephew by looking to help him fix it. However, before he could, he was captured by the Wookiee bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]] and tortured. Meanwhile, Luke was running away from home for not the first time. However, he sensed something was wrong and rushed to his homestead. When he arrived, he found many droids destroyed and his aunt Beru rattled, telling him of the attack. She ordered her nephew to lock himself in the homestead's maintenance bay, where he found his disabled skyhopper. He proceeded to fix it and make his way to Krrsantan and Owen. As he flew there, the Wookiee was engaged by Obi-Wan Kenobi. During this battle, Owen was thrown off a cliff. Before he could hit the bottom, Luke, in his skyhopper, managed to catch him and escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi defeated Krrsantan.

A krayt dragon was nearby when Skywalker woke up, but they were saved by Kenobi, meeting him for the first time after his adoption to the Lars family.

Obtaining the droids from a band of Jawas to help with various tasks around the homestead, neither of them were aware that the droids had narrowly escaped from the Galactic Empire, and that R2-D2 contained a set of [[Death Star plans|plans]] for the Empire's dreaded [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nWhile cleaning the two new droids back at the homestead, Skywalker learned that they had been involved with the Rebel Alliance, and witnessed part of a desperate message from [[Prince]]ss Leia Organa requesting help from someone named \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" whom R2-D2 claimed that he once belonged to. Skywalker soon found himself in the company of Kenobi after being attacked by [[A'Yark's tribe|a group]] of [[Tusken Raider|Sand People]] out in the [[Jundland Wastes]]. After traveling back to the [[Ben Kenobi's home|Jedi's home]], Kenobi soon revealed to Skywalker that he had once been a Jedi Knight who served in the Clone Wars with Skywalker's father. He went on to inform Skywalker that his father was not a spice freighter navigator like his uncle had always told him, but a Jedi Knight struck down by Darth Vader. Skywalker was also given his father's [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]] by Kenobi,<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> allowing the blade to be ignited for the first time in years.<ref name=\"Complete Visual New\" /> After he showed Princess Leia's message in its entirety to Kenobi, the old Jedi Master requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through, and offered to show him the ways of the Force.

Caught by the Death Star's [[tractor beam]], they were brought aboard the massive [[space station]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nOnce on board, Luke and Han knocked two stormtroopers out and stole their armor, whereas Kenobi set out to deactivate the tractor beam. However, when R2-D2 discovered that Leia Organa was being held captive on the station, Skywalker insisted on [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescuing]] her. Though Solo was reluctant to go marching into the [[Detention Level|detention block]], Skywalker convinced him to go along with the rescue by claiming that he'd get a significant reward for doing so.\n\nStill using their stormtrooper guises, Skywalker and Solo convinced Chewbacca to pose as a prisoner and escorted him to [[Detention Block AA-23]] (where Organa was being held.) They were able to rescue Organa, but their cover was blown and they had to jump into the [[garbage compactor]] in order to escape the pursuing Imperial forces. Though Skywalker and Organa were separated from Solo and Chewbacca, they were able to reunite with their companions, and the droids, in the hangar bay.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nEventually, the group escaped the Death Star, but only after Kenobi sacrificed himself in a duel with Darth Vader.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Angry and confused, Organa offered some comfort for his grief.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> Despite the fact that they had escaped from the Death Star, a pursing TIE fighter patrol was on the verge of catching up to them, so at Solo's request, Skywalker manned one of the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} [[quad laser cannon]]s to eliminate the enemy fighters, with Skywalker managing to destroy two of them. Once the patrol was eliminated, they traveled to the hidden [[Great Temple|rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]], unaware that the Death Star was tracking them.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n====Battle of Yavin====\n{{Quote|Great shot, kid; that was one in a million!|Han Solo to Luke Skywalker after the destruction of the Death Star|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n[[File:Red5.jpg|thumb|left|235x235px|Skywalker fought for the Rebel Alliance as an X-wing starfighter pilot during the Battle of Yavin.]]\nUpon their arrival at the Yavin base, they met with [[Commander]] [[Vanden Willard|Willard]] <ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> and Organa introduced him to Skywalker so that he could join the Rebel Alliance as a [[Rebel pilot|pilot]]. Skywalker then separated and met [[Wedge Antilles]], who oversaw his flight simulation test. Lasting no more than 30 [[second]]s, the more experienced pilot advised Skywalker to listen to his explanations, and encouraged him not to give up. In his second try, Skywalker used what he had learned from Antilles, and managed to surpass the highest score, that of Antilles's, prompting Willard to accept him without objection.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> He joined [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Group]] with the designation of [[Red Five]],<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> which had previously belonged to a [[cadet]] named [[Pedrin Gaul]],<ref name=\"Rogue One Visual Guide\">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref> who had perished during the [[Battle of Scarif]] several days earlier.<ref name=\"Rogue One\">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>\n\nAfter the briefing for their plan of attack against the incoming Death Star, Skywalker prepared himself for the attack, when he saw Solo loading his payment onto the ''Falcon'' for rescuing Organa and prepared to leave the group. Skywalker attempted to persuade him to stay and help them against the Empire, but Solo refused, claiming that the attack on the Death Star was suicide rather than bravery, deeply disappointing him. After bidding farewell to Organa as well, Skywalker was about to board [[Red Five (X-wing starfighter)|his]] [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]], when he encountered his old friend Biggs Darklighter, the two about to be flying as wingmen in the upcoming battle. In a brief conversation, Darklighter promised Luke that the two would catch up on each other's stories when they got back. Skywalker was also approached by [[Garven Dreis]], the commander of Red Squadron, who asked him if he was sure he could handle the X-wing, to which Darklighter vouched for his friend, calling him the \"best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.\"<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Skywalker was assigned command of [[fourth flight]] for the battle.<ref name=\"Duty Roster\">{{Shortstory|story=Duty Roster|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Battle of Yavin]] got underway and Skywalker and his fellow squadmates launched into space, Skywalker was guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He participated in Red Squadron's initial assault on the Death Star's outer defenses, primarily focusing on disabling the station's numerous [[XX-9 heavy turbolaser battery|turbolaser batteries]] and fighting off TIE fighters when they were deployed against the Rebel fighters. He also helped to provide cover for [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]] when they made the first attack run on the [[meridian trench]], as well as Commander Dreis when he made his attack run. Eventually, Darth Vader himself joined the fray in a [[TIE Advanced x1]] and succeeded in thwarting the first two attack runs. Just before he was shot down by the Sith Lord, Commander Dreis instructed Skywalker to lead a third and final run on the trench with Darklighter and Antilles.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nSkywalker took charge of the last attempt on the [[thermal exhaust port]] as instructed, but Vader and his two escort fighters soon caught up to them. Antilles was forced to withdraw after his starfighter suffered damage, and Darklighter was eventually shot down as well. Unable to grieve for his fallen friend, Skywalker tried to focus on his target. He was once again contacted by the spirit to Kenobi, who urged him to let the Force guide him. This prompted Skywalker to disable his starfighter's [[targeting computer]], much to the confusion of the Rebel leaders continuing to monitor the battle from the surface of Yavin 4.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nJust as Skywalker reached the end of the trench, it appeared as though Vader would shoot him down like he had the other pilots, but before he could, Han Solo and Chewbacca showed up in the ''Millennium Falcon'', destroying Vader's two escorts and causing Vader's TIE Advanced to spiral out of control away from the trench. At Solo's urging, Skywalker took a single shot and fired two [[proton torpedo]]s, using the Force to guide them to their target, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star. For this action he, Chewbacca, and Han Solo were awarded the [[Medal of Bravery]] the next morning.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_watches_Leia_escape.png|thumb|right|230x230px|After destroying the Death Star, Skywalker became a fully committed soldier in the Rebellion.]]\nJust as the [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]] ended, Skywalker told Organa to allow herself some time to grieve for the loss of her family and homeworld.

He signed up to the [[Rion Swoop|race]] and started bragging about his skills to other pilots. Two pilots, however, understood that Solo had a big bounty on his head and decided to sabotage the race and hand over the rebel soldier to the Empire.\nIn the meanwhile, Skywalker ended the negotiations with [[Razian]], an alien that should have provided the supplies to the Rebel Alliance, but noticed that half the credits were missing. He understood that Solo took part to the race, and went to the stadium in which Solo was racing. In the stands he heard two criminals talking about how they would knock Solo out: Skywalker and Chewbacca put the two criminals out of action, and Skywalker went to help Solo who was being targeted by his opponents who agreed to eliminate him.

He was accompanied by Artoo and a pilot named [[Nakari Kelen]], and they flew her ship, the ''[[Desert Jewel]]''. During their mission together, they [[Skirmish over Llanic|helped]] a [[Kupohan]] ship&mdash;which, unknown to them at the time, carried vital intelligence on a [[Givin]] cryptographer named [[Drusil Bephorin]]&mdash;near [[Llanic]]. They then continued their journey to Rodia. Skywalker was greeted by [[Laneet Chekkoo]], who guided him to [[Toopil]]. During business with [[Taneetch Soonta]], the [[Rodian]] told Skywalker about the Jedi, including a story about Anakin during the Clone Wars. From her, Skywalker received [[Huulik|her uncle's]] [[Huulik's lightsaber|lightsaber]].<ref name=\"HttJ\" />\n\n[[File:Brazilian_Heir_to_the_Jedi_cover.png|thumb|right|242x242px|Skywalker and Nakari on Fex.]]\nAfter killing a [[ghest]] and getting some treatment for his wounds, Skywalker focused on analyzing Huulik's lightsaber and trying to learn [[telekinesis]], but a planetwide alert for the ''Desert Jewel'' forced him to leave Rodia immediately and meet up with Ackbar and Organa on the ''[[Promise]]''. The two assigned him to a [[Mission on Denon|mission]] to rescue Bephorin on [[Denon]], but the need for upgrades for the ''Jewel'' prompted him to go on another [[Mission to Fex|mission]] to [[Fex]] with Kelen before that. Warned by Organa not to blindly trust Kelen, Skywalker set off for [[Pasher]] with Kelen and Artoo to receive intel from [[Fayet Kelen|her father]] about their destination and the necessary equipment to survive its atmosphere. The two then headed towards Fex. Once they successfully retrieved the [[Harvester (XS-800)|''Harvester'']] and were rewarded for it, Skywalker and Kelen traveled to Rodia to fix the ''Desert Jewel''.<ref name=\"HttJ\" />\n\nFollowing the ship's modifications, the two Rebels returned to the ''Promise'' to receive more intel on the Denon mission from Organa and Ackbar, only to depart for the planet as soon as possible, meet with their contact [[Sakhet]], and prepare Bephorin's liberation. Once in motion, their plan allowed them to escape from [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[agent]]s, and Denon altogether, with the Givin cryptographer onboard the ''Jewel''. Despite several hiccups along the way, including an extended stop on [[Kupoh]], they reached [[Omereth]]. There, however, the ''Jewel'' was intercepted by [[bounty hunter]]s and a confrontation ensued between the Rebels and their pursuers. Despite the formers' victory, Kelen was killed by one of the bounty hunters&mdash;saddening Skywalker, who had come to develop feelings for her. After allowing himself some time to grieve for those he had lost during the war, Skywalker completed his mission by reuniting Bephorin with her family and meeting with [[Major]] [[Bren Derlin]]. Afterwards, Skywalker returned Kelen's body to her father, after reflecting on the fact that he had learned how to move objects with the Force thanks to her support.<ref name=\"HttJ\" />\n\n====Devaron====\n{{Quote|Hyperspace scout.

Once the package was clear, they followed the scatter protocol, and Skywalker and R2-D2 set course to [[Devaron]] when he had a vision about future events on that same planet. He soon met with Antilles and Narra, who sent him, C-3PO and R2-D2 on a [[Mission to recover Imperial communication logs|mission]] for [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]].<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_vs_Training_remotes.png|thumb|left|207x207px|Luke Skywalker training at the site of the former Jedi Temple of Eedit on Devaron.]]\nAfter refueling the ship, the trio departed for [[Whiforla II]] and jumped out of hyperspace in the [[Tertiary Usaita system]], but an Imperial attack forced them to return to Devaron and repair the [[Y 4]], this time letting the Force guide him into the [[Temple of Eedit]]. Landing in [[Tikaroo]], Skywalker left the ship for repairs with [[Kivas]] and his daughter, [[Farnay]], using the alias \"Korl Marcus,\" and went onto the depot where he was told the Temple was off-limits; after resting and a vision of the past, he left the depot and met with Farnay, to whom he revealed his true identity. Ultimately, [[Sarco Plank]] accepted to be his guide and brought Skywalker and the two droids close to Eedit, where Skywalker found a secret entrance to the Temple and entered alone with the droids.<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" />\n\nDuring his stay on the Temple, Skywalker heard Kenobi's voice, from whom he received further instructions. He managed to enter a secret chamber where he and the droids found three training remotes. Using what Kenobi had taught him on the ''Falcon'', Skywalker gradually managed to pass the exercises after a few days, only to find himself surrounded by Imperials with orders to apprehend him and his fugitive [[starfighter]], using Farnay as a hostage. However, Plank unexpectedly appeared and helped Skywalker [[Skirmish in the Temple of Eedit|fight]] the stormtroopers with his [[electrostaff]], and observed that Skywalker was merely a [[Padawan]].<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_and_Sarco_Plank_in_Eedit.jpg|thumb|right|213x213px|Skywalker and Sarco Plank engage Imperial forces in the Temple of Eedit.]]\nPlanning to ransack the Temple to pay his debts, Plank then challenged him to a duel, during which he used a [[grenade]] to blind him, seeing that Skywalker would not be defeated so easily. Prepared to administer the coup de grace, Farnay interrupted him, for which Plank put [[binder]]s on her; however, it gave Skywalker time to stand up and slash Plank's control box, casting him and his electrostaff into a pit leading to the temple's underlevels. Skywalker then passed out and Farnay tended his wounds, to whom he swore he would become a Jedi and rebuild the [[Jedi Order|Order]], and return to Eedit one day. With the droids, they left the Temple as Imperial reinforcements arrived afterwards. Skywalker eventually kept his promise to Farnay and returned to Devaron accompanied by C-3PO and R2-D2. While there Luke also visited the Temple of Eedit once more.<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" />\n\nBack in Tikaroo, Skywalker reclaimed his now-repaired starfighter from Kivas, and before departing Devaron, he dropped several bombs at the base of the spire to cut off the paths into the jungle, meaning to stop the [[pikhron]] hunt.<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" />\n\n====Mission to Hradeek====\n{{Quote|W-What's happening to me?

After accomplishing the mission, the Jedi felt a [[disturbance in the Force]]. He entered in a room in which many dead corpse lay, noticing that in the middle of it there was a [[crossguard lightsaber]]. Once he took the weapon, several stormtroopers entered in the room. Skywalker ignited the [[Darth Atrius' lightsabers|lightsaber]] and slaughtered all the Imperial troopers. After killing the last one, Skywalker was surprised by the unnatural anger that he had felt and told to R2-D2 that, during the battle, it was like he was watching without being able to stop himself, but that now he was fine.<ref name=\"SWA4\">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 4|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\nSoon after the fight, while he was walking down a corridor, a sudden explosion knocked him away from his astromech droid: as he stood up he tried to contact R2, but another stormtrooper squad found him and started shooting at him. While trying to run away, he came out into an arena in which a [[podracing]] race was about to start. Skywalker stole a [[podracer]] from an [[Er'Kit]] pilot and took part to the race trying to escape from the troopers. After a flight that the commentator said no one had \"ever seen anything like it\", one of the engines blew up and Skywalker found himself on foot. He ignited the red-bladed lightsaber he had found, but was able to control his anger and, to avoid it to overwhelm him again, destroyed it with his blue-bladed lightsaber. He was then rescued by an X-Wing piloted by R2-D2.<ref name=\"SWA4\" />\n\n====Cymoon 1====\n{{Quote|You, boy, are ''no'' Jedi.

While Organa, Solo, and R2-D2 rigged the place to destroy it, Skywalker watched for additional Imperial troops, using what little he knew of the Force to reach out and sense any nearby presence. However, he was drawn to caged [[Slavery|slaves]], whom he proceeded to free, and guided them to a rendezvous with Solo and Organa, when they were alerted of Vader's arrival by Chewbacca.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" />\n\nDetermined to fight Vader for killing his father and Kenobi, he heard his mentor's voice speak to him from beyond, telling him to run, just as he faced the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" /> However, he was no match for Vader, who quickly seized Skywalker's lightsaber and was about to kill him, until he realized that Skywalker's lightsaber had been once his own.

Determined to destroy the factory, Skywalker disobeyed Organa's orders and used his stolen speeder bike to destroy the power core despite Vader's threat.

Let's hope I was ''wrong''.|Luke Skywalker|Star Wars (2015) 5}}\nOnce they returned to the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]], Skywalker continued working on his lightsaber techniques until Organa came to see him. Skywalker told her that he lacked interest in undertaking any more missions, as he did not consider himself a Jedi but a danger, and that until he could figure out who he was, he could not be around the Alliance; he asked Organa to let him go. Much to her and Solo's dismay, Skywalker (along with R2-D2) took off in an X-wing and set off on a course for Tatooine. Hoping to find some guidance in Kenobi's hut, Skywalker and R2 made their way across the [[desert]] to the abandoned residence, where they found it being pillaged by Tusken raiders, who fled in fear upon seeing his activated lightsaber.<ref name=\"SW4\">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Boba_Fett_vs_Luke_Skywalker.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker duels Boba Fett after being ambushed in Obi-Wan Kenobi's former home on Tatooine.]]\nInside the hut, Skywalker had R2 scan the ransacked place for anything of value, and the small android came across a box addressed to Skywalker.

Here's your chance. Go die like one.|Kreel to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars (2015) 11}}\nThough Kenobi's journals contained a number of stories, Skywalker became frustrated as he continued to read them as he did not understand what lessons were to be learned about using a lightsaber or wielding the Force. Though Artoo suggested returning to the fleet, Skywalker had no intention of returning until he found the answers he was seeking. Artoo's suggestion did, however, give the young Jedi an idea: to venture into the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]], the former home of the Jedi Order. Before he could travel to Coruscant, however, Skywalker set a course to [[Nar Shaddaa]], a world of pirates and outlaws known as the \"Smuggler's Moon.\" Upon landing, Skywalker set off looking for someone who could help him get to the [[Jedi temple|Jedi Temple]]. He entered a cantina, where he was immediately attacked by criminals looking to rob and kill him. Skywalker brandished his lightsaber and demanded that they cease their attack, while the bartender asked where he acquired a Jedi's lightsaber. He did not answer, instead saying that he was simply on Nar Shaddaa to conduct business and had already stated his purpose for entering the establishment. The bartender guessed that Skywalker was seeking entry into the Jedi Temple, meaning he would need to hire someone who could sneak him onto the capital world of the Empire. The bartender told him that he could do that for the boy, but the price would be the lightsaber&mdash;a price that Skywalker rejected, so the bartender resorted to his previous plan of killing and robbing the boy.<ref name=\"SW8\">[[Star Wars (2015) 8|''Star Wars'' (2015) 8]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Luke_Skywalker_and_the_thief_fall.png|thumb|right|241x241px|Skywalker and the thief fall towards the streets of Hutta Town, as the young Jedi reaches for his weapon.]]\nBefore the others could kill him, however, a [[Unidentified lightsaber thief (Nar Shaddaa)|thief]] stole the lightsaber and fled the bar. Skywalker gave chase,<ref name=\"SW8\" /> pursuing the [[thief]] through the streets and over rooftops. The thief jumped onto a ship that was passing by and hung onto the bottom of it, and Skywalker used the Force to make the now-even longer jump towards them and grab the thief's leg. The thief lost his holding and both men fell towards the streets of [[Hutta Town]] below, where Skywalker retrieved his lightsaber once both he and the thief landed. The young Jedi was then confronted by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt, a Nar Shaddaa crime lord who employed the thief that stole the lightsaber. Skywalker fought the Hutt's [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuard]], while at the same time overhearing the thief telling Grakkus that Skywalker said his father was a Jedi and that he was seeking access to the Jedi Temple. Having his own plans for the boy, Grakkus knocked Skywalker out with a punch to the face.<ref name=\"SW9\">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref>\n\nSkywalker later awoke to find himself in Grakkus' [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|palace]], which contained untold numbers of relics from the Jedi Order. Grakkus held out a Jedi [[holocron]], though Skywalker did not know what it was. Grakkus, who explained that he was a collector of [[Jedi artifact]]s in addition to being a crime lord, told him that the item was a holocron and that only an individual who was strong with the Force could open it. Though Skywalker had no experience with holocrons, the Hutt gave him five seconds to open the holocron or be killed. Under threat of death, the boy reached out with the Force and was able to open the holocron, as well as the many others that were in the collection. They revealed themselves as containing historical records about the Jedi and the Sith, including the revelation that there was a [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi Temple]] on [[Vrogas Vas]]. With Skywalker having proved himself, Grakkus believed he would make a fine addition to his collection as the last living Jedi. Grakkus planned to put Skywalker into an arena fight that he would bill as the death of the last Jedi, so the Hutt ordered him taken to the arena's gamemaster to be prepared. Artoo, knowing that Skywalker had been captured, send a distress call to the Alliance Fleet, where it was intercepted by the High Command. Though Chancellor Mothma was unwilling to send a team of Rebels on a suicide mission despite Skywalker's importance to the Rebellion, Chewbacca and Threepio&mdash;who remained with the fleet while Solo and Organa were on their own mission&mdash;volunteered to rescue their captured friend.<ref name=\"SW9\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_Skywalker_vs_the_gamemaster.png|thumb|left|233x233px|Grakkus the Hutt's \"Gamemaster\" Kreel bests Skywalker in a training duel on Nar Shaddaa.]]\nThe gamemaster&mdash;secretly an Imperial stormtrooper named [[Sergeant]] [[Kreel]]<ref name=\"SW12\">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>&mdash;introduced himself to Skywalker once the Jedi was led to the arena, and he stated that it was his job to make sure Skywalker was prepared to put on a good show before ultimately dying in the arena. Though Skywalker initially refused to fight, Kreel knew he would ultimately do so because he wanted to learn to hone his skills as a Jedi. The Kreel also told him that the Jedi Temple no longer existed, as it had been converted into the Imperial Palace&mdash;so whatever Skywalker was hoping to find was gone, as were the other Jedi temples in the galaxy. He then threw the lightsaber to Skywalker and removed the binds that the boy's hands were in. While surrounded by MagnaGuards, the Kreel used a lightsaber of his own and engaged in a duel to begin preparing him for the arena match. Though the Kreel was not a Jedi, he was a more-skilled swordsman and quickly bested Skywalker. Skywalker then engaged multiple MagnaGuards in combat.<ref name=\"SW10\">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref>\n\nThe big event soon arrived, and crime lords and other criminal types flocked to watch the death of the last Jedi. Skywalker spoke to Grakkus, who reminded him that no one wanted to watch him win and that everyone had paid to see him die, though the young Jedi believed he could succeed nonetheless. Grakkus also revealed that scavengers had found Skywalker's X-wing and the Journal of Ben Kenobi, which Grakkus intended to add to his collection. The event began once Grakkus left, and Skywalker entered into the arena and was introduced as the last of the Jedi. The announcer claimed that he was a veteran of battles across the galaxy and that he had fought Hutts and bounty hunters alike, hyping up the untrained Jedi hopeful. The announcer then introduced the Jedi's opponent: [[Kongo|Kongo the Disemboweler]], a large and fearsome creature from the [[dolovite]] [[Mining|mines]] of [[Mustafar]]. Skywalker ignited the green-bladed lightsaber that was given to him for the show and the fight began. The young Jedi slashed his blade at the creature, but the opponent's armor was resistant to a lightsaber blade and made it difficult for Skywalker to combat the creature. He remained confident, however, reminding himself that he blew up the Death Star, fought Boba Fett, and was trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi. He closed his eyes in an attempt to use the Force as his ally, but Kongo used the opportunity to throw Skywalker across the arena and knocking him onto the ground.<ref name=\"SW11\">[[Star Wars (2015) 11|''Star Wars'' (2015) 11]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Luke_fights_in_the_arena.png|thumb|right|257x257px|Skywalker battles Imperial soldiers in Grakkus' arena.]]\nThe beast grabbed Skywalker as the audience cheered for Kongo to make the kill, and Skywalker tried calling out to Kenobi to ask for miracle. Just as he did so, the beast's [[shock collar]] was activated by Kreel, who revealed himself to Grakkus as an Imperial and announced he was taking Skywalker into custody. Stormtroopers [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|poured]] into the arena and surrounded Skywalker, arresting both him and the Hutt. Grakkus had one trick up his sleeve, though, and triggered an electromagnetic pulse that disabled the Imperials' blasters. Grakkus, skilled at combat in his own right, began fighting the weaponless stormtroopers, while other troops grabbed Skywalker. Just then, the young Jedi saw that Artoo, who had infiltrated the palace, recovered his lightsaber and threw it into the arena, so Skywalker grabbed it and cut the soldiers down. Kongo chased the spectators out of the arena, and Skywalker while Kreel confronted Skywalker, knocking him to the ground and revealing his true identity as a stormtrooper of the [[501st Legion]] tasked with arresting him. Skywalker was saved by the timely arrival of Grakkus, who Kreel attacked as Skywalker got away.<ref name=\"SW12\" />\n\nSkywalker regrouped with Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids, all of whom ultimately traveled to Nar Shaddaa to rescue their captive friend. Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca each wielded lightsabers that Artoo stole from the palace so they were not defenseless in the wake of the EMP blast, leading Skywalker to quip that Solo looked good with a lightsaber. Artoo recovered Kenobi's journal and Skywalker wanted to go back to the palace to recover more artifacts, but the arena was flooded with blaster-wielding stormtroopers so Chewbacca grabbed the resistant Skywalker and brought him out of the arena. The Rebels returned to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escaped from Nar Shaddaa.<ref name=\"SW12\" />\n\n====Vrogas Vas====\n{{Quote|...right now I'm just a Rebel pilot who needs to help his friends. Learning to be a Jedi will have to wait.|Skywalker, to R2-D2|Vader Down 1}}\nThough he was unable to acquire the relics in Grakkus' palace, the holocrons he activated gave Skywalker one important piece of information: the existence of a Jedi Temple on Vrogas Vas. Skywalker returned to the Alliance but still sought answers, so he traveled to Vrogas Vas and was stationed in orbit with Red Squadron, along with [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]] and [[Yellow Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Yellow Squadron]]. While in orbit and preparing for training exercises, Darth Vader<ref name=\"Vader Down 1\">[[Vader Down 1|''Vader Down'' 1]]</ref>&mdash;who had learned of Skywalker's location from one of his associates, a rogue [[archaeologist]] named [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]]<ref name=\"Vader 12\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 12]]</ref>&mdash;dropped out of hyperspace in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Vader made quick work of Blue Squadron and Yellow Squadron, destroying them both as Red Squadron looked on. Skywalker sensed that Vader was the pilot of the enemy starfighter, made a run towards him, and crashed his X-wing fighter into the Sith Lord's TIE Advanced. The collision damaged both vessels and send them hurtling towards the surface of Vrogas Vas.<ref name=\"Vader Down 1\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_senses_Obi-Wan_and_Anakin.png|thumb|left|283x283px|Skywalker senses the presences of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the temple ruins.]]\nSkywalker and Vader both survived the crashes of their starfighters, though they impacted on the surface in different places. The young Jedi crashed outside of the ruins of the Jedi Temple, from which he witnessed the destruction of [[Gray Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gray Squadron]] forces sent to attack Vader&mdash;part of a major Rebel operation to capture the lone Sith Lord. He put off his search for answers and began to make his way towards the Rebel forces, determined to help his friends.<ref name=\"Vader Down 1\" /> As he passed through the ruins of the Jedi Temple, he could see [[Cyan Three|yet another]] Rebel pilot being killed by the Dark Lord. Unknown to Skywalker was that, at the same time, he was being tracked by Vader's companions&mdash;Aphra and the [[assassin droid]]s [[BT-1]] and [[0-0-0]]. While the Sith Lord's followers prepared a plan to capture the boy, Skywalker found writings in the ruins that were written with a lightsaber, letting him deduce that the ruins were from the Jedi. A cold feeling passed over him and he could sense the presence of what he thought was Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. He tried to concentrate, but he was interrupted by what he thought was Threepio's arrival. In reality, it was Triple-Zero, painted in gold by Aphra, who placed his metal hand on Skywalker and sent an electrical charge through the boy's body, knocking him unconscious.<ref name=\"Vader 13\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref>\n\nAphra and Triple-Zero prepared to take Skywalker hostage when Artoo stepped in to help. Bee Tee then brought his arsenal to bear on the rebel's astromech and chased him off. Aphra and Triple-Zero then seized Skywalker but were stopped by the smuggler Han Solo, who had a sniper rifle aimed at them. Chewbacca then came in and attacked the protocol droid, ripping his arm off. Skywalker then regained consciousness, dispatched Bee Tee, and sliced off Triple-Zero's other arm with his lightsaber. Skywalker and his allies then retreated when Bee Tee fired his weapons blindly.<ref name=\"SW13\">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref>\n\nSkywalker, Solo, Chewbacca, and Artoo made their way back to the Millennium Falcon. They then lifted off in order to aid princess Leia. They were forced to the ground when their ship was crashed into by the Wookiee bounty hunter Black Krrsantan. While Solo and Chewbacca dealt with the mercenary, Skywalker left to head back to the Jedi ruins.<ref name=\"DV14\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref>\n\nLuke arrived back at the the Jedi temple looking for Leia. It was then that he heard the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who told him that he should not have come to this place and that he was not ready for what is coming. Luke was then intercepted by a company of stormtroopers who opened fire on him. He retreated behind cover but was hit in the head and knocked unconscious.<ref name=\"SW14\">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref>\n\nLuke was taken prisoner by the forces of Commander [[Karbin]]. However Darth Vader, who had a rivalry with Karbin, used the force to crash the shuttle Skywalker was kept in. Now free, he then caught up with Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2. They made their way back to the Millennium Falcon, however Dr. Aphra had laid out a minefield to stop them. When she was distracted she was knocked out from behind by Princess Leia. Believing her to be of use, Organa decided to take the archaeologist with them. As they departed Vrogas Vas, Skywalker felt remorse that he would not be able to go back to the temple and see what was hidden there.<ref name=\"DV15\">[[Darth Vader (2015) 15|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>\n\n====Learning the ways of the smuggler====\n{{Quote|How else are we gonna replace the money we just lost?''\"<br>\"''Heh, don't worry, kid.

Meanwhile, Solo and Skywalker were dispatched to buy supplies for the rebellion. Solo attempted to double the money he was given for supplies by betting on [[sabacc]]. However, he was caught cheating, and had to escape with Skywalker on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name=\"SW16\">[[Star Wars (2015) 16|''Star Wars'' (2015) 16]]</ref>\n\nSkywalker and Solo traveled to Nar Shaddaa where Luke was tasked with finding a customer in need of a ship. He made a deal to haul [[nerf]]s to [[Ibaar]] for 5,000 credits, which was just enough to replace the credits lost by Solo. Skywalker and Solo were soon intercepted by TIE fighters who suspected the Falcon of smuggling illegal livestock.<ref name=\"SW17\">[[Star Wars (2015) 17|''Star Wars'' (2015) 17]]</ref> Luke was able to shoot the fighters and he and Solo made it to Ibaar with the nerfs.

[[Gial Ackbar|Admiral Ackbar]], General Dodonna, and Mon Mothma presented them with the task of providing aid to the people of [[Tureen VII]], a planet that had provided aid to the rebellion in the past. A heavily blockaded planet with Imperial bases on both of its moons and swarms of TIE fighters in orbit, the Alliance could not risk sending the fleet. Luke and Leia proposed stealing an Imperial Star Destroyer and using it to infiltrate the blockade.

Aboard the ''Falcon'', Davane provided Skywalker with Leia's data tape, which he noted was a sign of great trust between the two of them. With her place as a friend of the Alliance confirmed, Skywalker and his allies returned Davane to her home on Skorii-Lei.<ref name=\"Star Wars Annual 2\">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' Annual 2]]</ref>\n\n====Journey to Vagadarr system====\n{{Quote|You remind me of him.

With his own X-wing's [[hyperdrive]] temporarily disabled, he resumed reading Ben Kenobi's journal. Identifying a symbol in the journal as a [[star map]], Skywalker decided to visit the [[Vagadarr system]] after reading of a Jedi Master who had ventured there in the past and encountered enormous [[Giants of living stone|giants]] made of living stone that gave those in close proximity a power known as [[Stonepower]].

Determined to protect them, Skywalker inspired Garro to change his mind and sacrifice his own life force to revive a dead giant.

Threatened by its denizens, he defended himself alongside Doctor Aphra and Black Krrsantan, who had lied to Sana Starros in order to find Skywalker.. Claiming to know where to find a Jedi Master, Aphra convinced an initially hesitant Luke to [[Mission to Ktath'atn|visit]] the [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|Screaming Citadel]] with her. While on the way, she introduced him to the [[Rur crystal]] of the ancient Jedi splinter group known as the [[Ordu Aspectu]]. Aphra claimed that introducing him to the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen of Ktath'atn]] as a Jedi would allow them to reactive that crystal. At Ktath'atn, the entire party, except for Krrsantan were allowed into the citadel. Aphra presented Luke to the Queen who, unbeknownst to them, planned on eating Skywalker.<ref name=\"The Screaming Citadel 1\">[[The Screaming Citadel 1|''The Screaming Citadel'' 1]]</ref>\n\nHaving been selected by the Queen from a group of other creatures of interest, Doctor Aphra and Skywalker ate in a dining hall with the monarch. The Queen commanded Luke to move a nearby dining tray with the Force, though he was unable to until the Queen's servant, [[Vespinax]], threatened him with a knife to his throat. Moving the tray revealed to the duo that the Queen planned on implanting them with an [[Abersyn symbiote]], so they quickly made an attempt to escape. In the Citadel's hallway, they were nearly stopped by many of the Queen's thralls.<ref name=\"SW 31\">[[Star Wars (2015) 31|''Star Wars'' (2015) 31]]</ref>\n\nBefore Luke needed to use his lightsaber to defend them, Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Sana Starros arrived at their location on Aphra's ship, the ''[[Ark Angel II]]'', with her droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 in tow. Starros attempted to shoot Aphra, but Skywalker blocked the blast with his lightsaber, claiming that she was his friend. Meanwhile, the Queen's servants and armed security guards pursued the group, so they escaped into an Abersyn symbiote laboratory. Aphra led Luke to a nearby room and sold him out to the Queen of Ktath'atn, who promptly enthralled him.<ref name=\"Aphra 7\">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref> Rather than infect him with an Abersyn symbiote, the Queen connected Luke to a machine that would allow her to directly feed on him. Solo attempted to rescue him, but was quickly enthralled and forced to lead the Queen's forces. In an ensuing struggle, Skywalker managed to re-arm himself with his lightsaber and fell under the influence of an Abersyn symbiote, becoming more powerful than even the Queen, and proclaimed himself King of the [[Queen of Ktath'atn's hive|hive]].<ref name=\"SW 32\">[[Star Wars (2015) 32|''Star Wars'' (2015) 32]]</ref>\n\nDoctor Aphra, deciding to return to save Luke, allowed [[Eternal Rur]] to enter his mind to assist him. Rur advised Luke to use the symbiote to his advantage, claiming that tying the Force's abilities into the parasite's emotional drive would make him immensely powerful. Choosing to ignore Rur, Luke let go, connected to the Force, and was able to free himself of the symbiote's influence and strike down the Queen. Han and all those under the Queen's control were freed, and the Citadel was destroyed by BT-1. Reuniting with his friends, Luke told Aphra to stay away from them.

With Imperial TIE Fighters in pursuit, Skywalker was forced to fly into a [[nebula]], which disabled the shuttle's systems, forcing them to crash land on an [[Unidentified ocean planet|ocean planet]]. Stranded on the planet for three weeks, Skywalker's experience with machinery such as [[moisture vaporator]]s helped keep himself and Leia alive. Having to live off of the land, the two grew closer, relating to each other because of their status as orphans. They eventually realized that there was a [[Unidentified aquatic species|native species]] living in the planet's ocean. Not wanting to bring the war to these people, Skywalker and Organa set a trap for the Imperial forces that were [[Escape from an unidentified ocean planet|pursuing]] them. Luke used the native's resouces, as well as his own lightsaber, to fend off an AT-AT and [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretroopers]].

On the ashy moon, Luke and Leia defended what remained of [[Saw Gerrera]]'s [[Partisans]] from invading [[Cold weather assault stormtrooper|snowtroopers]] and brought them aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Moving to [[NaJedha]], the planet that Jedha orbitted, Luke met [[Chulco Gi]], an aspirant to the [[Disciples of the Whills]], someone wou could potentially guide him in learning about the Force. Gi led the rebels to the rest of the Partisans on Jedha and placed hoods over their heads, in keeping with Partisan tradition. Led by [[Benthic]], Saw Gerrera's former second-in-command, the remaining extremists held guns at their fellow rebels' heads.<ref name=\"Star Wars 38\">[[Star Wars (2015) 38|''Star Wars'' (2015) 38]]</ref>\n\nBenthic questioned why the Alliance would attempt to mend their relations with the Partisans and return to Jedha, and Leia revealed that the Empire had resumed mining [[Kyber crystal]]s on the planet and that the Alliance hoped to aid the Partisans in fighting against the Empire. Though wary of Alliance support, Benthic was nonetheless willing to accept some aid. Luke, shaken by the Partisans' extreme methods, was conflicted by agreeing to help them, but [[Rebel Alliance Special Forces|specforces]] operative [[Ubin Des]] reassured him that it was the right thing to do. Later in the ruined settlement of [[Ai-jed]], Luke, Chulco, and Ubin contemplated why people would stay on a ruined planet. Stormtroopers armed with [[flamethrower]]s attempted to incinerate the remaining civilians, but Luke lashed out against them with his lighstaber, cutting them all down. Realizing all that was at stake in the Galactic Civil War, Skywalker approached Benthic with Han Solo and wholeheartedly agreed to assist him in his fight. Their first target was the [[drill citadel]], a mining device from the planet [[Shu-Torun]] that the Empire began using to mine Kyber crystals on Jedha.<ref name=\"Star Wars 39\">[[Star Wars (2015) 39|''Star Wars'' (2015) 39]]</ref>\n\nBenthic and Luke scaled the drill citadel and the Tognath ruthlessly killed the station's guards, much to Skywalker's chagrin. Benthic held a technician at gunpoint and forced him to lower the citadel's shields before killing him as well. This allowed Han Solo, aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', to destroy the drill citadel after Benthic and Luke escaped. Later, a disillusioned Chulco asked Luke to accompany him to meet the [[Central Isopter]], a death-worshipping cult that Gi claimed was wise in the Force. Although Luke was hesitant to seek the guidance from someone other than a disciple of the Jedi, he nonetheless was willing to go along. Leia attempted to convince him that his duty to the Alliance was most important, but Luke believed that becoming a Jedi and avenging all those slain by Darth Vader was the most important duty to him. Entering a chasm alongside Gi, the duo were attacked by a [[sand slug]], a giant, normally herbivorous animal negatively influenced by the Dark Side of the Force. Able to slay the beast, Skywalker and Gi were finally confronted by the Central Isopter, who claimed that they had come to join them \"in the shadow of death.\"<ref name=\"Star Wars 40\">[[Star Wars (2015) 40|''Star Wars'' (2015) 40]]</ref>\n\nAt the edge of the planet's blast crater, Chulco and the Central Isopter presented Luke with the [[Temple of Central Isopter]], a shrine surrounded by the Dark Side of the Force. The cult implored Skywalker and Gi to meditate and listen to the chasm's call. They both did, but Luke refused to let the Dark Side take hold of him. However, Chulco was possessed by the darkness and attacked Luke, forcing the Jedi trainee to strike him down. The cultists then announced that they had received a distress call from Chewbacca, who was being pursued by a TIE fighter over NaJedha. Luke borrowed a ship, was able to destroy the TIE fighter and bring an injured Chewie to the planet, where he provided the Alliance with the plans for the [[Leviathan (Continent-class crawler)|''Leviathan'']], a mobile fortress able to strip mine Kyber crystals from Jedha.<ref name=\"Star Wars 41\">[[Star Wars (2015) 41|''Star Wars'' (2015) 41]]</ref>\n\nHan, Leia, and Benthic formed a strategy to destroy the ''Leviathan'' using the plans Chewbacca obtained. After the meeting, Luke ruminated on the sacrifice Rogue One made to get the Death Star plans to the Alliance, ultimately leading to him making the shot that destroyed the battle station. A newly motivated Luke accompanied Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 aboard the crawler and readied themselves for taking control of it. Skywalker made his way to the bridge of the ''Leviathan'' and held its commander, [[Kanchar]], hostage but the Imperial's cybernetic arm was equipped with a blade able to defend against Luke's lighstaber.<ref name=\"Star Wars 42\">[[Star Wars (2015) 42|''Star Wars'' (2015) 42]]</ref>\n\nKanchar pursued Luke throughout the ship with his cybernetic arm's blade and flamethrower. Eventually leading the officer to the crawler's hangar, Skywalker activated an ion torpedo, which shut down Kanchar's cybernetics and allowed Luke to knock him out. Having taken total control of the ''Leviathan'' with the help of the double-crossing Queen [[Trios]], the rebels brought it to Jedha's chasm, destroye it, and escaped with not much time to spare. Having saved what remained of Jedha and made allies in the form of the Partisans and Queen Trios, Luke and his friends left Jedha.<ref name=\"Star Wars 43\">[[Star Wars (2015) 43|''Star Wars'' (2015) 43]]</ref>\n\n====Investigating Lotho Minor====\n{{Quote|I'm not sure there's much to give up on, Leia.

Upon arriving on the desert world, Skywalker sensed through the Force that there was something more at play beyond the actions of a few mercenaries. He requested the assistance of [[Saponza's partner|an agent]] who had a reputation for desert warfare and, together, the two defeated the mercenary outposts. The two also discovered from Imperial operatives in the [[sector]] that Imperial supplies were being ferried from Nar Shaddaa to Er'Kit, suggesting a large-scale operation was under way. Eventually, Skywalker and the agent arrested the mercenary leader and tracked down the last members of Malachor Company, who had holed up in an empty village.<ref name=\"Commander-Echoes\">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]'', Rebel Campaign: ''Echoes of the Force''</ref>\n\nAmong the mercenaries' possessions, Skywalker and the agent discovered a document proving that Malachor Company was preparing to ship supplies somewhere, and its coordinates led Skywalker and the agent to an Imperial base on the planet. They subsequently attacked several Imperial bases until they found intelligence pertaining to the Empire's operation on the planet. Once they located the base from which the Imperials deployed most of their forces on the planet, Skywalker assaulted it with the assistance of Princess Organa. The Rebels razed the base, dealing an important blow to the Empire's operations on Er'Kit, but they still lacked vital information on what the Empire's true purpose was on the planet. Skywalker gradually discovered Imperial logs detailing how Malachor Company had been hired by the Imperial Security Bureau and were tasked with forcibly relocating natives to make room for [[Project Hidden Eye]]. This ISB operation was intended to create cybernetic [[Sleeper operative|sleeper agents]] who could be deployed throughout the galaxy and spy on galactic citizens on behalf of the ISB. Upon its discovery, Project Hidden Eye was nearly ready to deploy its first wave of spies.<ref name=\"Commander-Echoes\" />\n\nTo prevent the operation from being carried out, Skywalker and the agent led their troops to the base that housed Project Hidden Eye. They fought through its staging area and ultimately took out the installation, ending the Imperial project for good. Skywalker thanked the agent for their service and then remained on Er'Kit for a short time, helping the Rebel Alliance execute additional missions on the desert world.<ref name=\"Commander-Echoes\" />\n\n====Bogano====\nAt some point, Luke was given a mission to analyze different worlds in search of which could host a rebel base. However, as he did so, Skywalker felt the Force drawing him to [[Bogano]], a grassy planet in the [[Outer Rim Territories]]. As Skywalker meditated on the planet, he began to hear the voice of her friend and companion rebel Leia Organa. Luke thought the Force allowed the two to communicate across the galaxy, but Leia was behind him. Leia asked what Luke was doing there since Bogano was one of the worlds she had to check out, and Luke told the Force had taken him there. The two were taken to the [[Bogano Vault]] by a small animal. Skywalker sensed the Force was strong in the place, and while Leia thought the world might be a good base, Luke disagreed. Skywalker was apparently right, as the small animal led them to a group of stormtroopers who were dealing with animals of the same species, making it clear that the Empire knew the world.<ref name=\"Bog\">\"[[The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 1]]\"-[[Star Wars Adventures (2020) 7|''Star Wars Adventures'' (2020) 7]]</ref> Along with Leia, Luke defeated the stormtroopers, who intended to sell the animals on the black market, and then left the planet to continue his mission to verify the planets assigned to him.<ref>\"[[The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 2]]\"-[[Star Wars Adventures (2020) 8|''Star Wars Adventures'' (2020) 8]]</ref>\n\n====Sergia====\n{{Quote|And look at ''this''.

After bidding farewell to his friends,<ref name=\"SYWtBaJ?\">''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]''</ref> for the impending [[Battle of Hoth|battle]], Skywalker was to lead Rogue Squadron in an [[T-47 airspeeder|airspeeder]].<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Before he departed to the battlefront, he was spotted by rebel journalist [[Corwi Selgrothe]], who wanted to quickly interview him for propaganda footage, but she was instead led to the escape transports by rebel trooper [[L'cayo Llem]].<ref name=\"Heroes\">{{Shortstory|story=Heroes of the Rebellion (short story)|sformatted=Heroes of the Rebellion|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> During the battle, Skywalker led his speeders against the walkers, ordering Rogue Squadron to pull the AT-ATs down with tow tables after realizing their armor could resist their blasters.

In their initial meeting, Skywalker was frustrated and impatient and was rather short-tempered with the diminutive Yoda, who did not initially identify himself and purposefully tested Skywalker's patience, telling him a story about three brothers,<ref name=\"SYWtBaJ?\" /> and taking him back to his [[Yoda's Hut|hut]] to partake in a meal of [[rootleaf stew]], which he did not find very appetizing. However, Skywalker gained a new appreciation for the small creature upon learning his identity, and Yoda agreed to train Skywalker only at the insistence of Kenobi's spirit. Skywalker's training proved to be difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind toward action and emotional instinct.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nDuring his training with Yoda, the Jedi Master had Skywalker climb a tree to use his senses to find a way through the tree, Skywalker lost his balance and fell from the tree. Yoda decided to have Skywalker carry him as he redid the task.<ref name=\"FOD\">{{FOD|The Path Ahead}}</ref>\n\nWhen Yoda asked him to enter a [[Cave of Evil|cave]] that was strong in the dark side in which he was supposed to find only what he took with him, he was challenged by a vision of himself wearing the [[Vader's armor|armor of Darth Vader]], meant to symbolize his inner darkness.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Master and apprentice then had an encounter with a raging [[elephoth]], which Skywalker managed to calm by leading her to her child.<ref name=\"SYWtBaJ?\" /> Shortly after, he had a vision of Han Solo and Leia Organa suffering at [[Cloud City]] on [[Bespin]]. Unable to get the visions out of his head, and convinced that his friends would surely die if he did not help them, Skywalker decided to end his training prematurely to rescue them, despite Yoda and Kenobi's insistence that he was not ready to face the dark side on his own yet, but Skywalker was convinced that he'd learned enough to hold his own, and he could not just stand by and leave his friends to the mercy of the Empire.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nSeeing that Skywalker's mind was made up, Kenobi let him know that if he ended up facing Vader, he could not interfere on his behalf, and advised him not to give into hatred. Likewise, Yoda advised him to mind what he'd learned. Skywalker promised to do so, and vowed to return to Dagobah one day to finish his training.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n====Vader's trap====\n{{Quote|Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.''\"<br>\"''He told me enough!

The princess attempted to warn Skywalker that he was walking into a trap, but his path was diverted to the [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freezing chamber/Legends|chamber]] where Darth Vader awaited him, with the intention to freeze him in [[carbonite]] to present him to the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]]. Skywalker engaged the Dark Lord in a fierce [[Duel on Cloud City|lightsaber duel]].<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nDuring the duel, Vader praised Skywalker's training in the Force thus far and attempted to goad him into giving into his anger and hatred, claiming that it was the only way to defeat him. Vader managed to knock Skywalker into the carbon-freezing chamber and appeared to have frozen him like he had Solo, but Skywalker [[Force jump|lept]] out of the chamber before the process was finished, which left Vader impressed.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nThe duel eventually carried into the control room of one of Cloud City's [[gas-processing vane]]s. Vader began using the Force to throw various objects in the chamber at the young Jedi hopeful. One such projectile, a large piece of metal piping, was misdirected and smashed through a nearby observation port. The chamber was quickly depressurized, sucking Skywalker out onto the nearby sensor relay catwalk overlooking the [[reactor shaft]]. Skywalker managed to grab on to the catwalk's railing and pull himself up.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nVader re-entered the fray and forced Skywalker back onto the catwalk. Sensing that Skywalker was weakened, the Sith Lord demanded that Skywalker surrender, lest he be destroyed as Obi-Wan Kenobi had been. Skywalker refused and desperately tried to keep fighting Vader, to which Vader responded with several ferocious strikes, ultimately forcing Skywalker to the very edge of the catwalk and slicing off his right hand. Both Skywalker's hand and his lightsaber fell into the depths of the reactor shaft.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_whining.jpg|thumb|right|209x209px|The revelation that Vader was Skywalker's father shook the Jedi hopeful to his core.]]\nSeeing that Skywalker was vulnerable in his weakened state, Vader offered to show Skywalker the power of the dark side and complete his training, but Skywalker adamantly refused to ever join Vader, the man who had killed his father. In that moment, Vader revealed the truth: that ''he'' was his father.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nHorrified by Vader's shocking revelation, Skywalker initially denounced the Sith Lord's claim as untrue and impossible, but Vader insisted that they both knew that it was the truth. Vader further claimed that Skywalker was powerful enough to destroy the Emperor, and when he did, they could rule the galaxy together as father and son.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /><ref name=\"BtPotDS!\">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> Unwilling to join Vader but too weak to fight back, Skywalker took the only option he had left, and allowed himself to fall down the reactor shaft, being sucked through several vents and eventually being deposited to the outside of the floating city. Though he managed to grab onto a [[Weather scanner vane|weather vane]] to avoid falling to his death, he knew he was unable to stay there forever, especially in his weakened state. Calling out to Kenobi at first but getting no response, in desperation, he called out to Leia Organa through the Force, who was able to hear the call.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nSoon, the ''Millennium Falcon'', with [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids onboard, arrived to rescue him. As they [[Escape from Cloud City|escaped]] from Bespin, and the ''Falcon'' was faced with the Imperial fleet, Vader reached out to Skywalker through the Force, calling him \"son.\"<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Skywalker fought tears back, after hearing the word he had always longed to hear while lamenting that Kenobi had not told him the truth,<ref name=\"SYWtBaJ?\" /> just as the ''Falcon'' made the jump into hyperspace thanks to R2-D2.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n===Aftermath of Vader's revelation===\n====Haunted by the truth====\nHaunted by the truth of his parentage, Skywalker found his connection to the Force considerably weakened, with his control over it remaining sporadic. Aboard the ''Falcon'', Organa informed him of what had happened to Solo. Skywalker wanted to begin searching for his friend immediately, but Organa told him that there was more at stake than just Solo's life and it would be best to reconvene with the Rebel fleet first. With Skywalker agreeing to this plan, the ''Falcon'' jumped to hyperspace.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1 2020\">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref>\n\nThe ''Falcon'' arrived at the Rebellion's [[Rendezvous Point Delta-Three]] in the Mid Rim to find the fleet's Fourth Division under attack from several Star Destroyers, including the ''[[Tarkin's Will]]'', which was under the leadership of Commander [[Ellian Zahra]]. As the ''Falcon'' entered the battle, Skywalker volunteered to commandeer the ship's belly gun, despite his injuries. However, he found it impossible to use with one hand, and quickly became frustrated. His anger resulted in him unknowingly using the Force to make several of the attacking TIE Fighters crash into one another. With Luke stunned by his sudden show of strength, the fleet jumped to hyperspace.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1 2020\" />\n\nWith the fleet regrouped, Skywalker found a deserted part of the flagship and attempted to contact Yoda through the Force. Angry at the Jedi Master's refusal to answer, he almost shattered one of the ship's windows in another frustration-fueled loss of control over his Force abilities. He wondered whether the lack of answers from his mentors signified a premature end to his Jedi training, and who he was meant to be if not a Jedi.<ref name=\"Star Wars 1 2020\" />\n\n====Return to Cloud City====\nOrgana told Skywalker that he should have a [[Mechno-arm|prosthetic hand]] installed in the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|Nebulon-B frigate]] ''[[Redemption]]''{{'s}} medbay. Although unsure whether it would help his mental state, Skywalker agreed,<ref name=\"Star Wars 2 2020\">[[Star Wars (2020) 2|''Star Wars'' (2020) 2]]</ref> and received the hand as Calrissian and Chewbacca set out to find Solo.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nUpon their return, Calrissian found Skywalker training to fire a blaster with his prosthetic hand. Observing the would-be Jedi's struggles, Calrissian suggested that they return to Bespin so as to retrieve Skywalker's lightsaber. As they talked, Skywalker was suddenly confronted with a vision of a female [[Verla|hooded figure]] catching his lightsaber and telling him to follow his destiny.<ref name=\"Star Wars 2 2020\" />\n\nSkywalker, accompanied by Calrissian, Organa, and R2-D2, returned to Bespin, where they were fired upon the [[Bespin Wing Guard]]. Fortunately, Calrissian was able to remotely disable the city's turrets, but the team were soon ambushed by stormtroopers upon landing. Needing to carry out their missions as quickly as possible to avoid capture, the rebels split up, with Skywalker and R2-D2 heading to the smelting chamber where Calrissian claimed his lightsaber should be located.<ref name=\"Star Wars 3 2020\">[[Star Wars (2020) 3|''Star Wars'' (2020) 3]]</ref>\n\nHowever, Skywalker found mountains of debris in the chamber and realised that it would be impossible to recover his lightsaber. Sensing that Organa was in trouble, he abandoned the search and found Calrissian surrounded by stormtroopers. Skywalker used the Force to push the Imperial soldiers through a window, telling Calrissian that he did not need the lightsaber to be a Jedi. Together, they rescued Organa and several Cloud City citizens and escaped, with Skywalker stealing his X-wing back. He temporarily parted ways with the other rebels, flying off in search of the woman from his vision.<ref name=\"Star Wars 4 2020\">[[Star Wars (2020) 4|''Star Wars'' (2020) 4]]</ref>\n\n====Verla====\nHaving used the planet he saw in his vision as the basis for his search, Skywalker arrived at the planet [[Serelia]], where he encountered the woman from the vision at a dock on the coastline. However, when he asked whether she was a Jedi, the woman responded by dropping a large amount of fish on top of him and escaping in a boat. Undeterred, Skywalker gave chase but ended up capsizing the boat, washing ashore on a beach. He followed the woman into a cave, where he was almost killed by several booby traps and eventually fell into a cage that was gradually filling with water. As the woman watched, Skywalker attempted hold back the rising water with the Force, but was unable. The hooded woman asked him who he was and revealed herself to be Verla.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5 2020\">[[Star Wars (2020) 5|''Star Wars'' (2020) 5]]</ref>\n\nVerla informed Skywalker that it would be safer if he was to give up his dream of becoming a Jedi, cynically telling him about [[Order 66]], the [[Inquisitorius]] and Darth Vader himself. Sensing Skywalker's suspicious reaction to the mention of his father, Verla probed deeper into his mind and realised that he was the son of Vader. She increased the flow of water in the cage, attempting to drown him.<ref name=\"Star Wars 5 2020\" />\n\nFortunately, Skywalker's life was saved by R2-D2, who incapacitated Verla and resuscitated him. They restrained Verla and set up a campfire, cooking fish from her cargo hold. When she regained consciousness, Skywalker freed her as a show of good faith and asked her about his vision. Verla told him that she did not possess a lightsaber, as she had given up on the Force and refused to take part in the conflict between the light and dark sides. Although she strongly recommended that Skywalker should leave the Force behind, she informed him of a [[Jedi outpost (Tempes)|Jedi outpost]] from the [[High Republic Era]] on the Outer Rim astronomical object of [[Tempes]].<ref name=\"Star Wars 6 2020\">[[Star Wars (2020) 6|''Star Wars'' (2020) 6]]</ref>\n\nSkywalker flew to Tempes and was almost struck down by the planet's powerful lightning storm. He managed to outmanoeuvre the lightning and land safely, venturing into the outpost. Inside, he found a new yellow-bladed lightsaber but was attacked by the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor, who had been forced to guard the outpost for eternity by Vader. The Inquisitor taunted the young Jedi's skill with a lightsaber, but Skywalker was able to over power him and escape before Vader arrived.<ref name=\"Star Wars 6 2020\" />\n\nSkywalker returned to the Rebel fleet and reunited with Organa. Organa implored him to show the assorted rebels what he had found, and so Skywalker activated his new lightsaber, its yellow blade representing renewed hope for the future of the Rebellion.<ref name=\"Star Wars 6 2020\" />\n\n====Battle at Elessia====\n{{Quote|This is Red Leader--All fighters, on me--We need to make an attack run on the Seventh Division's cruiser, push those TIEs back.|Luke Skywalker|Star Wars (2020) 8}}\n[[File:RedLeaderLukeSkywalkerBattleInnerRim-SW8.png|thumb|left|140px|Skywalker leads fighters]]\nThe Empire's Commander Ellian Zahra intercepted a transmission that revealed the Alliances [[Fourth Division|Fourth]] and Seventh Divisions were planning to rendezvous somewhere in the Inner Rim, so Zahra initiated an [[Battle at Elessia|attack]] that saw her split her forces to strike simultaneously. Zahra's primary strike force led an attack on the Alliance's Seventh Division, while her secondary strike force attempted to attack Leia Organa's Fourth Division, however the Fourth had already left their rendezvous point before the strike force arrived. The Imperial forces overwhelmed the Seventh Division's capital ships. TIE interceptors created a blockade of ''Home One''{{'s}} hangar bay, that prevented Alliance starfighters from launching, including Red Squadron.<ref name=\"Star Wars 8\">[[Star Wars (2020) 8|''Star Wars'' (2020) 8]]</ref>\n\n[[File:BattleInnerRim-SW8.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker's fighters protect ''Home One'']]\nShortly into the battle, the Fourth Division's ships emerged from hyperspace and immediately deployed their starfighters, led by Commander Luke Skywalker, who assumed the callsign Red Leader. Skywalker was accompanied by other starfighters, that included Green Squadron's Shara Bey ([[Green Three]]), along with Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca in the ''Millennium Falcon''. Skywalker called for all Fourth Division fighters to form up on him, on an attack run on ''Home One''{{'s}} blockade, to push the TIEs back, while those starfighters who were trapped in the hangar bays prepared to launch, including Wedge Antilles (Red Two). As soon as Skywalker cleared the TIEs, all the Alliance starfighters aboard ''Home One'' launched to repay the favor.

When the time came for Organa to attend the top clearance meeting with the Rebel leadership, Skywalker and Nunb met with Antilles for a discussion of \"reconnaissance tactics\" about Antilles' refusal to pay the [[Sullustan]] a drink.

During the raid, Skywalker used his new lightsaber, along with his Force abilities, to clear a path for Rebel forces to acquire copious Imperial fuel stores. His Rebel companions became awed at his use, although one of them, the [[Unidentified Rebel major (Pau'an)|major]] in charge of the operation, held reservations about its power as he had only previously seen such power being wielded by the Sith. Unknown to Skywalker, the Emperor had begun to probe his mental defenses from afar, which caused Skywalker to briefly open his saber in alarm.<ref name=\"Age of Rebellion - Luke\">[[Age of Rebellion - Luke Skywalker 1|''Age of Rebellion - Luke Skywalker'' 1]]</ref>\n\nAs Skywalker and the strike team flew away from the platform, they were ambushed by an Imperial Star Destroyer, which launched several TIE Fighters in pursuit. As the battle began to rage, Skywalker's mind was penetrated by a vision from the Emperor. The vision saw Luke follow a possible series of events wherein he would begrudgingly leave the Rebel strike team to its fate and crash-land on an unknown planet, losing his X-wing in the process. As he journeyed from the wreckage together with R2-D2, Luke would leave his lightsaber and helmet on the ground, symbolizing his complete retreat from the concerns of the war.<ref name=\"Age of Rebellion - Luke\" />\n\nHaving later broken free of the Emperor's vision, Skywalker proceeded to aid the Rebels in escaping the Imperial ambush, using his lightsaber to prevent the major's shuttle from leaving, giving him time to pilot the shuttle and draw the Imperials away from the rest of the Rebels.<ref name=\"Age of Rebellion - Luke\" />\n\n====Solo's rescue====\n{{Quote|I am taking Captain Solo and his friends.

Using the Force to assemble the weapon, he brought the kyber crystal inside to life, making the weapon his own, almost an extension of himself.<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" />\n\nAfterwards, Skywalker waited to see if Organa's impersonation of [[Boushh]] and liberation of Solo was successful without his intervention, but she was only half-successful. She then sent a message to Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured as well, prompting Skywalker to act and go to Jabba's Palace.<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" /> Skillful use of the Force allowed Skywalker to get past Jabba's [[Gamorrean]] guards and his [[majordomo]], [[Bib Fortuna]], but the Hutt was not so easily swayed and attempted to feed Skywalker to his [[rancor]], which Luke later killed, upsetting [[Malakili]], the Rancor's keeper.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nSkywalker killed the monster, but Jabba was furious and sentenced all the captured Alliance heroes\u2013including an unfrozen Solo\u2013to death in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] to be eaten by the [[sarlacc]] that resided there.

Skywalker then asked about the \"other Skywalker,\" who Kenobi told him was his long-lost twin sister, who had been separated from him at birth to protect them from the wrath of the Empire. Skywalker instantly came to the realization that this sister was Organa, which was confirmed by Kenobi.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Skywalker almost immediately inquired about their mother's identity and fate, but Kenobi asked him to let that truth stay with him for a while longer, as he knew Skywalker carried too many burdens already.<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" />\n\n====Endor's test====\n=====Adventure on the moon=====\n[[File:Luke_on_Endor.jpg|thumb|right|215x215px|Skywalker left his allies on Endor, believing he endangered the mission.]]\nSkywalker nevertheless accompanied his friends on the mission to the forested [[moon]] of [[Endor]] to destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] that protected the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]] in [[orbit]], volunteering immediately upon arrival at the Rebel briefing above [[Sullust]]. As they approached the moon on the stolen [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class Imperial shuttle]] ''[[Tydirium]]'', Skywalker sensed Vader's presence on the nearby [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]'' and realized his presence was endangering the mission; yet, it was his presence that prompted Vader to allow their landing. Upon doing so, the Rebel force was discovered by a small force of [[Scout trooper|Imperial scout troopers]] that were guarding the shield bunker, and Skywalker and Organa pursued them on [[74-Z speeder bike|speeder bikes]]. Though they successfully stopped the scouts, Organa became separated from Skywalker.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nUpon learning of her disappearance, Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and the droids went looking for her, only to be captured by a tribe of [[Ewok]]s. Using the Force to prove C-3PO's [[Deity|deific]] \"[[Magick|magic]],\" Skywalker convinced the Ewoks to release them and, after C-3PO's tale of their adventures, the whole group was accepted as a part of the [[Bright Tree Village|village]].<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> However, Skywalker felt as Vader reached out to him through the Force and landed on the moon,<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" /> and knew that he had to confront Vader.

He informed her of what he was planning to do and also told her that, in the event that he did not make it back, she would the last hope of the Alliance, going on to tell her that she was his sister, and she could use the Force too.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nOrgana was initially shocked that she and Skywalker were actually brother and sister, but admitted to him that, somehow, she'd always known, and attempted to dissuade him from confronting their father, but Skywalker was adamant that he could redeem Vader, and set off.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nEventually encountering an Imperial patrol and willingly surrendering himself<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> to Commander [[Igar]],<ref name=\"Geektionary\">''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''</ref> Skywalker was brought to Vader and tried to convince his father to renounce the dark side by referring to him as \"Anakin Skywalker,\" but Vader harshly denounced his former name.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Although he managed to make Vader question the dark truths that had long ruled him,<ref name=\"BtPotDS!\" /> Skywalker ultimately became a prisoner of the Emperor as he was escorted to his [[Emperor's Throne Room|throne room]] onboard the Death Star.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n=====The final duel=====\n{{Quote|Now, go, my son.

He constantly encouraged Skywalker to give into his anger and hatred. Though Skywalker was resistant at first, his feelings of hopelessness and desperation only grew as the destruction of the Rebel fleet and the death of his friends appeared imminent. Attempting to strike down the Emperor, Skywalker found himself once again facing his father in a duel. Unlike their previous encounter on Bespin (where Vader was largely able to dominate the proceedings, throughout), this time the pair would fight as equals.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nAfter successfully parrying a flurry of blows, Skywalker sent Vader tumbling down a stairwell before regaining his composure and appealing to the good in his father. Vader would have none of it and attacked once again, though eventually Skywalker withdrew from combat altogether and refused to fight Vader any further, retreating into the shadows of the throne room.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nIn order to goad his son back into fighting him, Vader used [[telepathy]] to probe his thoughts, learning of the existence of his daughter and Skywalker's twin sister, stating that perhaps she could be seduced to the dark side if Skywalker could not. This statement pushed Skywalker over the edge and caused him to finally give into his rage. Attacking his father much more aggressively this time, he unleashed his full might upon the Sith Lord. Eventually pushing Vader into a corner, right next to the Death Star's reactor shaft, Skywalker repeatedly struck him with multiple heavy blows, and with one final, devastating strike of his lightsaber, sliced Vader's hand off at the wrist, sending it&mdash;and the weapon it still gripped&mdash;cascading down into the depths below.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nA cackling Sidious, delighted that Skywalker had not only given into his hatred, but made use of it to such an extent, encouraged him to deliver the killing blow to his father and take his place as his apprentice. However, Skywalker noticed that the hand he'd cut off was mechanical, much like his own, and in a moment of realization, saw that he was about to become what he had sought to destroy. Skywalker tossed his lightsaber aside and defiantly declared to the Emperor that he had failed, and that he was a Jedi like his father before him.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nInfuriated that his plan to corrupt Luke had gone up in smoke, Sidious declared that, if Skywalker would not be turned, he would be destroyed, and unleashed a barrage of [[Force lightning]] against him. Unprepared for the lightning, Skywalker desperately tried to protect himself, to no avail.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> Wanting Skywalker to suffer as much pain as possible for daring to defy him, the Sith Master gradually increased the intensity of his lightning,{{Fact}} all while intermittently taunting him.

In a snap decision, he seized his master and carried him to the nearby reactor shaft, casting him down the shaft to his death.

Though Luke was hesitant to do so, convinced that his father would die without it, Anakin told him that nothing could prevent his death now, but before he died, he wanted to look upon his son with his own eyes. Luke relented and removed the mask, gazing upon his father's real face for the first and only time. Anakin then encouraged Luke to leave him and save himself. Though Luke was insistent on saving Anakin, his father assured him that, by bringing him back to the light, he already saved him, and with his last words, told him to tell Leia that he'd been right about him before passing away.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> At the cost of his own life and with the help of his son, Anakin Skywalker had finally fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One and had brought balance to the Force.<ref name=\"Luke Skywalker\">{{Databank|luke-skywalker-biography-gallery|Luke Skywalker Biography Gallery|archivedate=20190909204412}}</ref> Similarly, by helping his father to return to the light side of the Force by offering him unconditional love and refusing to fight, destroy, or let his anger eclipse the goodness in his [[heart]], Luke Skywalker had achieved what Anakin and the whole Jedi Order failed to achieve upon being twisted by the Clone Wars: to forgive a monster and reveal a man.<ref name=\"S:AFaW\">''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''</ref>\n\nSkywalker took his father's body on board the shuttle and escaped just before the Death Star's destruction,<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> when he was almost intercepted by [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green Squadron]]{{'s}} Shara Bey, who proceeded to cover him from [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE interceptors]] after he identified himself.<ref name=\"SE1\">[[Shattered Empire 1|''Shattered Empire'' 1]]</ref> Back on Endor, Skywalker [[Funeral of Anakin Skywalker|cremated his father's armor]] (his body had vanished) in the manner of a [[Jedi funeral|Jedi's funeral]], and then joined his friends and sister in the celebration.

Chasing the call, Luke along with R2 took his X-wing and set course for the remote aquatic planet. When they arrived, the two came across an Imperial Shuttle making its descent, confirming Skywalker's suspicions that the planet held something of importance. He left his faithful Astromech Droid with his ship, and it was not long before the young Jedi encountered Stormtroopers on guard, who attacked him on sight. Skywalker made his way through several dozens of troopers and officers, remarking that the Empire must have been searching the planet. Sensing something unnatural from within a nearby cave, the Jedi found that native wildlife, [[Scritter]]s, were attacking the invading imperials. Hearing cries for help, Skywalker made his way further into the depths of the planet to find [[Del Meeko]], a member of [[Imperial Special Forces]] Unit [[Inferno Squad]], with his arm stuck in the amber of the Scritters. Despite their different allegiances, Skywalker used his lightsaber to cut through the amber and free the soldier. When Meeko asked why the Jedi helped him, Skywalker simply responded, 'Because you asked'.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>\n\nAt that moment, several Scritters burst out of the walls surrounding the two men. Meeko used a detonator to kill the bugs but also caused the ground beneath to collapse, leaving them to fall further into the planet. They landed in a small shallow stream of water, and Skywalker used the Force to protect Meeko from falling rocks. After being helped to his feet, Meeko remarked that stories of the Jedi always scared him as a young boy. Skywalker responded that if they want to get out, they'll need to work together. Making their way through the caves, Luke shared that the Force has brought them to together and apologizes for killing the rest of his men; he was reluctant to do so, but they left him no choice, while Meeko did. As the two made their way out of the cave, Del revealed that the Emperor had an observatory on the planet and that Meeko was tasked with destroying it. Skywalker and Meeko eventually escaped the cave and gained access to the observatory by destroying its defense system.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\nSkywalker discovered that the key to opening the vault door is to use the Force, prompting Meeko to wonder why the observatory could only be opened by the Force and if the man who hunted down the Jedi was secretly one of them. Luke suggested that Del had learned to fear the wrong thing.<ref name=\"Battlefront II\" />\n\nThe two investigated the vault, apparently full of junk, and Skywalker took a [[Jedi star compass|compass]]. When Meeko asked why he should be allowed to keep it, Skywalker responded, 'Because I asked'. As the two left, Skywalker remarked that the Empire had done enough damage to innocent worlds and that Meeko could choose not between the Empire or the Rebellion, but to be a better person.

Under his tutelage, Organa constructed [[Leia's lightsaber|a lightsaber]], and began to learn the principles of lightsaber combat. He also instructed in her in the basics of the Force, teaching her about light side, and in meditation. Luke was impressed by Leia's strength in the force and how quickly she progressed in her training. While training Leia, Luke found it interesting that Leia struggled with skills and concepts that he had a natural affinity for (like lightsaber combat), but excelled in other areas (like meditation) that were harder for him to master. <ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> He would use various tools to help Leia develop her senses, such as a repurposed A-wing helmet, and marksman-H combat training remotes.<ref name=\"TROS VD\" />\n\nAt some point during their training together, Luke and Leia spent an hour sparring with their lightsabers.

The [[Uneti tree|tree]], which once dwelled in the heart of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, was stolen by the Emperor after he came to power and converted the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace. Skywalker recruited Shara Bey to fly as his co-pilot on the mission, and, along with Artoo, they flew a stolen Imperial shuttle, ''[[Antarra]]'', to Vetine. While en route, Skywalker told Bey about the plan, including how she would pose as ISB Agent [[Alecia Beck]], using codes obtained by Solo and the Pathfinders during a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an ISB base at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. Upon their arrival, Bey claimed she was Agent Beck and that she had arrived to perform an unannounced inspection. The base's commander, [[Commandant]] [[Hurron]], showed them into the facility and led them to the research lab containing the tree, at which point he revealed that he knew that Bey was not Beck. Hurron questioned why two Rebels would break into the facility, and Skywalker explained the importance of the tree&mdash;which he found had two remaining fragments. Skywalker and Bey fought their way out of the base, making their way through numerous stormtroopers who attempted to stop their escape. Once back at ''Antarra'', Hurron ordered his forces to throw thermal detonators at the escaping Rebels, but Skywalker used the Force to deflect them back, killing Hurron and several of his stormtroopers in an explosion.<ref name=\"Shattered Empire 4\">[[Shattered Empire 4|''Shattered Empire'' 4]]</ref>\n\nThe Rebel trio made their way back towards the Alliance Fleet. During the trip back, Skywalker and Bey discussed the latter's future plans for service in the Rebellion, as Skywalker knew that Bey was considering leaving the Alliance to reunite with her husband, Pathfinder Sergeant Kes Dameron, and their son Poe Dameron|Poe. Bey was unsure as to whether she wanted to leave the Rebels behind, but Skywalker's guidance helped Bey decide to leave the Alliance. The Jedi Knight gifted one of the tree fragments to her, as he had only expected to find one, believing that the important relic would be kept safe with Bey and her family.

He uncovered many tantalizing clues that hinted at the origins of the Jedi, but the precise location was a mystery. One key to unravelling the mystery was his study of the spread of the Force-sensitive uneti saplings.<ref name=\"TLJ VD\" /> He also made use of the Jedi star compass he had discovered in the Emperor's storehouse on Pillio. With a [[plasma]]-encased [[supraluminite]] [[lodestone]] at its center, the compass functioned much like the ancient [[wayfinder]]s and was attuned to specific points in hyperspace.

Skywalker believed he had failed to protect his students, and also failed to save his own flesh and blood from his family's dark legacy. So Skywalker fled into self-imposed [[Exile (punishment)|exile]], vanishing from the galaxy at-large without a trace. No one knew for sure where he went, but those closest to him believed he went off in search of the first Jedi Temple.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> To those who knew what Skywalker was seeking, there remained a way to find him: after destroying the Jedi, the Empire had begun to seek out the thousands of Jedi temples scattered across the galaxy, with the aim to prevent anyone from discovering the lost secrets of the Order. As such, Imperial authorities discovered the locations of some of the first Jedi Temples, including the one on Ahch-To. The information remained within the archives of the Empire, the access to which was severely restricted after the Galactic Civil War. The First Order was able to acquire most of the map, save for a fraction which was apparently stolen by Lor San Tekka. As he had downloaded most of the information possessed by the Empire during his time on the Death Star, R2-D2, Skywalker's faithful astromech, was also able to recover the contents of the map, but only by going into low power mode, which allowed him to sort through the wealth of information present in the Empire's archives.<ref name=\"TFA novel\">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref>\n\n===Exile on Ahch-To===\n{{Quote|...Luke Skywalker may be the only hope we have left.|General Leia Organa|Before the Awakening}}\n[[File:Old_Luke.png|thumb|right|288x288px|After exiling himself to Ahch-To, Skywalker resolved to die as the last Jedi.]]\nThe Jedi Master fled to the location of the Temple&mdash;on an aquatic planet named Ahch-To&mdash;by studying the spread of uneti saplings.

Resistance fighter pilot [[Jessika Pava]] learned that C-3PO, who also served in the Resistance, knew Skywalker and asked the droid to tell her a story about his former master. Threepio regaled her with the tale of Skywalker's encounter with Sarco Plank on Devaron, and how Skywalker kept his promise to Farnay and indeed returned to Devaron.<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" /> Members of the First Order, however, had a less-than-ideal view of the Jedi Master; the First Order taught their followers, including [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] like [[Finn|FN-2187]], that Skywalker was an enemy who helped destroy the Empire. Despite the knowledge about Skywalker, the mystical elements of his life, as well as the Jedi in general, were seen as mythic rather than historic.<ref name=\"EW Luke\">{{Cite_web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/11/12/where-is-luke-skywalker-star-wars/|title=Where is Luke Skywalker?

The First Order also learned of the map and sought it so they could destroy the last Jedi. Dameron found San Tekka living in the village of [[Tuanul]], and the old explorer gave the map to Dameron, who in turn gave it to his astromech droid [[BB-8]], before Kylo Ren and the First Order arrived and [[Attack on Tuanul|sacked]] the village. Ren killed San Tekka and took Dameron into custody in the hopes of finding the map, while BB-8 came into the possession of a Jakku [[scavenger]] named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]]. Rey believed that Skywalker was only a myth, but she too possessed strength in the Force that she had not yet discovered.

Accompanied by Chewbacca, Rey flew the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Ahch-to and found the old Jedi Master on an island.<ref name=\"Episode VII\" /> Shortly afterwards, one night, Skywalker had a dream while sleeping at his hut. In his dream, he saw the life he would never have, one in which he never left Tatooine and remained in the moisture farming business with his uncle, marrying Camie Marstrap and allowing the Galactic Empire to shatter the Rebel Alliance and destroy more planets with the Death Star, though there was a thing in common to his actual life: he regretted never having a child like his sister.

Later, Luke was folding his old clothes then heard Rey trying to reach out to him again by knocking on his door but he told her to go away. However, Luke was surprised when his door broke open but was even more surprised to see his old friend Chewbacca was with her. Hearing how they got to where he was with the Millennium Falcon, Luke asked where Han was as Rey and Chewbacca told him that his old friend and brother-in-law was dead, stunning Skywalker.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Feeling regret for not having sensed his brother-in-law's death for having disconnected himself from the Force, Luke was comforted by the Wookiee, who hugged him.<ref name=\"TLJ Adaptation 1\" /> When Rey discovered several original texts of Jedi teachings hidden within a sacred tree on the island, Skywalker learned that she had the Force within her and sought assistance to understand it and her place in the galaxy.

Although Skywalker grumbled that the tactic \"was a cheap move\" on the droid's part, it nevertheless inspired Skywalker to agree to give Rey some basic initiation training as a Jedi, explaining the basic foundations of the Force. During the first lesson, Rey sensed the presence of the dark side cavern underneath the island, causing the ground to shake around them as Rey felt the pull of the dark side. It was at this moment that Skywalker realized Rey's level of power was identical to that of his nephew Ben; this caused him to worry whether he should train another with such power and to promptly abandon the lesson.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Skywalker realized something else from this lesson; that Rey was the Emperor, Darth Sidious', granddaughter, which is why she was so easily drawn to the dark side.<ref name=\"S:AFaW\" />  He later found her practicing with a [[quarterstaff]] and then with the returned lightsaber. Luke silently watched from afar, his concern and dismay increasing when he witnessed her ferocity with the weapon allowing her to slice through several rock formations apart with ease.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nEventually after the second lesson, Skywalker revealed that his nephew Ben had the same tremendous power in the Force she had and was corrupted by Snoke's teachings to the dark side, becoming Kylo Ren. He then destroyed the Jedi temple Skywalker had started, taking some of his other apprentices with him and killing the rest. Skywalker went to the cliff side outcrop and managed to regain his Force abilities, which were suppressed for years after he shut himself off the Force allowing him to sense his sister from across the galaxy.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_interrupting_Rey_and_Kylo_Ren.png|thumb|right|260x260px|Disturbed by Rey's growing connection to Kylo Ren, Skywalker demanded that she leave the island.]]\nSkywalker went to find Rey in order to tell her that he was going back to the Resistance with her<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\" /> but instead he found Rey talking with Kylo Ren through the Force due to a [[Force-bond]] that he previously was unable to detect.

Skywalker clarified that when he had arrived at the hut, he sensed the power and darkness within his nephew and, for a brief instant, did desire to kill him and activated his lightsaber on instinct. However, the moment passed and left him filled with shame, for the look on his nephew's face was not one of darkness, but of a scared child, only for the boy to collapse the hut around them in self-defense.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nRey told Skywalker that like when he confronted his father about the light side still within him, she sensed the goodness still within Kylo Ren.

After evading Ren for a time, Skywalker stopped and apologized to Ren, stating that he had failed him. He also informed his former student that victory was not so certain as he believed; that the war was only beginning, and that the Jedi would continue through Rey. He then deactivated his lightsaber and offered to let Kylo strike him down, but warned him that doing so in anger would only cause him pain, just as killing Han had, and stated that in death, he would always be with his nephew.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Unknown to Kylo, Luke had sensed that Rey had lifted all the rocks blocking the exit of the Resistance base so they could escape to fight another day.<ref name=\"The Skywalker Saga\">''[[The Skywalker Saga]]''</ref>\n\nRen ignored all these warnings and slashed Skywalker across the torso. Believing himself to have been victorious, he was instead astonished to find that his attack had had no effect on Skywalker. He walked over to his former master and tentatively ran him through, and discovered that Luke was not physically present; he was in fact still on Ahch-To, [[Force projection|projecting]] an illusion of himself through the Force.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> The illusion was tailored to have the maximum effect on Ren, as Luke portrayed himself as he had last appeared to his nephew before they came to blows.

Light-years away, Skywalker collapsed from the mental stress necessary to sustain such a lifelike illusion, which Ren realized meant that Luke would become one with the Force.

As she threw her lightsaber into the wreckage of her ship, Luke appeared and grabbed it out of the air. Admitting that he was wrong in exiling himself, Luke consoled her that her legacy would not be defined by her bloodline but by her heart and her actions. When Rey lamented that Kylo Ren destroyed the final Sith marker that led to where the resurrected Emperor was residing, Luke mirrored the words of Yoda, stating that she had everything she needed. As a parting gift, Luke gifted Rey his sister's lightsaber and raised his old X-Wing from the depths of the ocean for Rey to use and travel to [[Exegol]].<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n[[File:Skywalkers-TROS.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Luke's spirit along with his sister watched over Rey from afar as she buried their Jedi weapons as tribute to the Skywalker legacy.]]\nRey could hear Luke among the numerous voices of the Jedi of the past shortly before she received the inner strength to overcome Palpatine. As the girl rose from the ground, Skywalker assured her that the Force would always be with her, and after she finally destroyed the Emperor by deflecting his Force lightning using Luke's and Leia's original lightsabers, he appeared one more time with his sister on Tatooine and watched from afar as Rey buried both of the weapons at the old Lars Homestead finally albeit posthumously formally earning the title of Jedi Master with his role as her mentor completed.

This belief led Luke to scour worlds for the remaining Jedi texts and gathered a new class of apprentices under his tutelage.<ref name=\"Secrets of the Jedi\" />\n\n[[File:Luke_Skywalker_TLJ.png|thumb|right|205x205px|In his later years, Skywalker lived in exile as a grief-ridden and embittered hermit.]]\nAfter Ben Solo, his nephew, betrayed him and killed most of his apprentices, Luke became embittered as well as grief-ridden and chose to exile himself to the planet Ahch-To, where he would spend the rest of his life in with the intention of dying where the Jedi began to forever end the Jedi. He also became more cautious in teaching others of immense power due to Ben's betrayal, feeling finished with the Jedi Order,<ref name=\"TLJ Read-Along Storybook & CD\">''[[The Last Jedi Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''</ref> as evidenced when he initially refused to train Rey and would later decide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her starting to turn to the dark side. He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo to return to the light.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> By this point, Skywalker had come to regard Ben as his responsibility and his greatest failure.<ref name=\"Secrets of the Jedi\" />\n\nHowever, after Yoda's spirit encouraged him that Rey was the Jedi's hope, Luke finally realized his wrongs and chose to help the Resistance. Despite his lost faith in his nephew, Luke showed great remorse for failing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the turning point in Ben's fall.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" /> Luke realized something important, that instead of blaming himself he blamed the Jedi for his failures. His belief of the Jedi being romanticized deitys with a legacy of failure remained, but gained realization that if one stripped away the sacred temples, lightsabers, and even the legends about them, they were just good people the galaxy needed.<ref name=\"Secrets of the Jedi\" />\n\nIn the end, Luke willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi to be revived and the Resistance to live on.

Luke's initial training with the weapon of the Jedi came during a brief session with Obi-Wan Kenobi and a training remote on the way to Alderaan,<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> where he learned the initial position and the four defensive postures.<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" /> Though his level proved inadequate during his first, but brief duel against Darth Vader on Cymoon 1,<ref name=\"SW2\" /> his combat skills had improved for their duel on Bespin,<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> and culminated with him besting the Sith Lord in combat during the Battle of Endor.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nSkywalker had some skills in Form V,  and was adept at redirecting blaster fire.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"HttJ\" /><ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> During his [[Mission to Rodia (Luke Skywalker)|mission]] to Rodia, he tried his hand at [[Jar'Kai]] for the first time with his and Huulik's lightsaber. Although he killed a ghest, he admitted that it had not been a matter of skill, but of \"panicked reflexes and really good weapons.\"<ref name=\"HttJ\" /> He received further training from the \"Gamemaster,\" a servant of Grakkus the Hutt, who had learned the art of lightsaber combat. Forced to fight him and the Hutt's MagnaGuards, Skywalker improved his cursory abilities.<ref name=\"SW10\" />\n\nAfter a brief time of training with Yoda, Luke revealed himself to be a gifted duelist on Bespin. Skywalker engaged Vader in a fierce duel and managed to hold his own for much of the duel, wounding Vader in the shoulder, impressing the Dark Lord with his skill, though Vader ultimately bested his son and cut off his hand, proving his superiority.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Later, Skywalker showed his abilities in battle during the rescue of Han Solo, where a skirmish ensued in which the Jedi killed many guards aboard the execution skiff and Jabba's sail barge. Later, on board the second Death Star, Luke showed his improved abilities and was finally able to duel Vader on an even footing. However, his unwillingness to fight his own father partly held him back; but when Vader threatened to turn Leia to the dark side, an enraged Luke unleashed all of his raw ability, overwhelming and defeating the Sith Lord.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nLater in life, Luke showed even greater abilities with a lightsaber. He taught multiple students in the art of lightsaber combat, including his nephew Ben Solo, who would later become his strongest student and destroy his Jedi Order. During his rescue of Grogu from Moff Gideon, Luke easily destroyed a platoon of Dark Troopers with his lightsaber and the force.<ref name=\"Chapter 16\" /> Several years later, Luke effortlessly overpowered the Knights of Ren, seamlessly dodging their attacks and destroying their weapons before using the Force to disarm them. When fighting an angry Rey using her quarterstaff, Luke, using a metal rod, easily blocked each and every single one of her shots after fluidly dodging her initial assault and hitting her once before soon disarming her. Later, on Crait, he managed to easily avoid every single one of Kylo Ren's attacks without needing to use his lightsaber to block, demonstrating his superiority with a lightsaber and distracting the the First Order long enough for the remaining members of the Resistance could escape.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\n===Force powers===\n{{Quote|I am one man.

Indeed, Darth Sidious believed that Skywalker was strong enough in the Force to destroy the Sith.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Most of Luke's understanding of the force came from his own research, exploration, and experience as he only had a few days Kenobi's mentorship before his demise, Yoda's one year of mentorship before he died of old age, and Kenobi's sporadic guidance from beyond the Netherworld of the Force.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" /><ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nAfter learning the basics of the Force, he quickly learned how to sense through it,<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> and took the habit of opening himself to the Force in hopes of learning more than Kenobi had told him, and becoming aware of his surroundings.<ref name=\"HttJ\" /><ref name=\"Star Wars 1\" /> In time, he would also learn to sense the presence of his father.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> He was capable of seeing and hearing those who had become one with the Force.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"Episode V\" /><ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> By using the Force during the Battle of Yavin, he managed to destroy the Death Star with a shot that many thought was impossible.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nAfter obtaining Huulik's lightsaber and dismantling it to know his inner workings, Skywalker surmised on his own that the Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and managed to learn how to move small objects, such as a noodle or a fork.<ref name=\"HttJ\" /> By the time of the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his hands, though not without difficulty.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Under Yoda's training, this ability was further developed, enabling him to levitate several objects at once while meditating.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Skywalker eventually learned other uses, such as [[Force choke|choking]] enemies and doing [[mind trick]]s,<ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> as well as performing Force-enhanced jumps.<ref name=\"SW9\" /><ref name=\"Episode V\" /><ref name=\"Episode VI\" /> He also demonstrated the ability to have visions several times.<ref name=\"weapon-jedi\" /><ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\nWhen facing the Knights of Ren, Luke effortlessly Force-Pushed the Knights of Ren and even telekinetically disarmed and destroyed their weapons without any effort.<ref name=\"Rise of Kylo Ren 2\" /> Shortly after recovering the ability to use the Force, Luke detected Rey and Ren's bond and in his anger, he Force pushed Rey's hut into pieces around the two and broke the connection. When defending himself against Rey, Luke easily pried an antenna from the roof of a hut and summoned it to himself in seconds and managed to keep himself suspended off the ground after being knocked down by Rey. Whereas Kylo noted that the very effort of using the ability of Force projection would kill Rey, Luke was able to use the complete version of this ability, giving all of himself into the Force, which allowed him to interact with others,<ref name=\"TROS VD\" /> sending a life-like image of himself across the galaxy to distract Kylo Ren and the First Order. The projection was so powerful that Luke was not only able to fool the senses of droids, as C-3PO had acknowledged his presence, but even Kylo was completely tricked into believing it was the real him; he maintained it for a prolonged period of time, although the strain ultimately proved to be fatal and killed the Jedi Master.<ref name=\"Episode VIII\" />\n\nLuke was one of the few Jedi who was able to truly become one with the force and preserve his consciousness as a Force Ghost. As a Force spirit, Skywalker was able to physically interact with the living world, as exampled when he caught his father's lightsaber after Rey threw it away, and when he lifted his X-wing from the oceans of Ahch-To and repaired it so that Rey could travel to Exegol.<ref name=\"Episode IX\" />\n\n===Other abilities===\n{{Quote|Luke is the best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.|Biggs Darklighter boasts about Luke's piloting skills to Garven Dreis|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\n[[File:X-Wing_Second_Edition_cover_art.png|thumb|left|249x249px|Skywalker, whose father was considered the best pilot in the galaxy, flew the X-wing starfighter that destroyed the Death Star.]]\nSkywalker was acknowledged to be an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying the first Death Star and managing to evade Darth Vader himself (albeit with help from Han Solo).<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> He also managed to destroy an [[Interdictor vessel]] on his own while piloting the ''Desert Jewel'', although he acknowledged that R2-D2 saved him when the astromech droid made the ship jump into hyperspace in the nick of time.<ref name=\"HttJ\" /> He was also able to pilot a Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle with relative ease, outmaneuvering an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]] that was trying to get a lock on him.<ref name=\"SE1\" /> In fact, Luke had a talent for tinkering and a passion for speed.<ref name=\"TLJ Junior novel\" />\n\nHe was a native speaker of [[Galactic Basic Standard]],<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> and although Skywalker could not understand [[Shyriiwook]], he had quickly learned how to read Chewbacca's moods by his tone and expression before the Battle of Yavin.<ref name=\"TPtSatFB\" /> After decades of missions with R2, Skywalker was reasonably fluent in droidspeak.<ref name=\"Expanded Edition\" />\n\nLuke was adept in unarmed combat. Luke demonstrated his skill early on Cymoon 1 where he defeated a few stormtroopers by kicking and slamming them to the ground, shortly after Luke found himself being attacked by an entire mob full of alien thugs on Nar Shadaa. Skywalker defeated numerous of the attackers unarmed before igniting his lightsaber and startling the rest. Luke found himself in another similar situation on Horox III, where he defeated an entire cantina of alien thugs with the help of Aphra and her Wookiee bounty hunter. Skywalker knocked out the Commander Kanchar, a hulking cybernetic enhanced man with a single punch after outsmarting him. Luke implemented his unarmed skill into lightsaber combat defeating countless of foes throughout his journeys as seen at the battle of the Great pit of Carkoon also when dueling Vader. At his later years, Luke displayed such skill that he was able to easily punch aside a Knight of Ren and disarm Rey of her quarterstaff so fast she couldn't even react.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:LukeROTJsaber-MR.jpg|thumb|right|171px|Skywalker built a new lightsaber after losing his father's weapon.]]\nLuke Skywalker wielded at least two lightsabers during the [[Galactic Civil War]].
