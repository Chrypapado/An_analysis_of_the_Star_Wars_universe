Seth Cambriel, beach-bum playboy extraordinaire, and Rebel spy on the side. Not a bad sort, from what I've heard.|A Rebel agent on route to Spira|The Spira Regatta}}\n'''Seth Cambriel''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who resided on the resort [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Spira/Legends|Spira]] during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]]. A self-made multi-[[Galactic Credit Standard|millionaire]] playboy, Cambriel posed as a genteel gentlemen of leisure, moving within the high society of Spira's elite while also working as a [[Spy/Legends|spy]] for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Using his access to high-ranking [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] officials, along with a network of informants who had no idea of his true allegiance, he passed on sensitive information to the Alliance. Cambriel worked alongside [[Harbold Taft]], a fellow spy and infiltrator, as a two-man [[Rebel cell (Spira)|cell]] on the planet.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Cambriel and a group of Rebel agents entered the [[345th annual Spira Regatta Open]], a famous [[Yacht (aquatic)/Legends|yacht]] [[Spira Regatta Open|race]], as a cover to recover Alliance supplies from a derelict [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Starship/Legends|spacecraft]] known as [[the wreck]] that was submerged in Spira's [[Ocean/Legends|oceans]]. The supplies, dropped on Spira by a [[Unidentified smuggler (Spira)|smuggler]] and hidden by Cambriel and Taft, were vital to Alliance operations in the [[Sector/Legends|sector]]. Despite the threat of Imperial interference&mdash;and the unwanted presence of [[Regenald Hanniper Snopps III]], son of [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag's]] Imperial [[Governor/Legends|governor]], [[Zafiel Snopps]]&mdash;Cambriel and the agents successfully recovered the supplies and [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggled]] them off-planet.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quote|Anyone know how we're supposed to get the goodies offplanet? Smuggling Rebel contraband out on a passenger liner is certainly a novel idea.''\"<br />\"''Cambriel is supposed to be handling that.|Two Rebel agents discuss Cambriel's role in their upcoming mission|The Spira Regatta}}\nSeth Cambriel was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who made a fortune in his youth by trading on companies being taken over by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]]. Having made millions of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]], he retired to the resort [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Spira/Legends|Spira]],<ref name=\"TSR\" /> in the [[Lytton sector]] of the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]],<ref name=\"TEA-OC\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-atlas-online-companion|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Atlas'' Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}}</ref> to live in comfort. He spent his [[Standard day/Legends|days]] lounging around the [[Aspre Plunge]] [[Hotel/Legends|hotel]] and [[Casino/Legends|casino]], or sailing his [[V-53 Hydromancer]] [[Yacht (aquatic)/Legends|yacht]], the ''[[Cambus Gale]]'', around [[Ataria Island]]. His evenings were spent playing [[Sabacc/Legends|sabacc]] in the casino until late. However, his appearance as a gentleman of leisure hid his allegiance to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. As a [[Spy/Legends|spy]], he used his access to drunken high-ranking Imperial officials to obtain information useful to the Alliance. Only one other person on Spira knew of Cambriel's double-life: his [[Rebel cell (Spira)|cell]] partner, [[Harbold Taft]], a spy and infiltrator specializing in military intelligence who worked at the Ataria Island [[Spaceport (Ataria Island)|spaceport]]. Cambriel maintained a network of informers&mdash;including [[Bartender/Legends|bartenders]], [[Janitor/Legends|janitors]] and [[travel agent]]s&mdash;none of whom was aware of his allegiance to the Rebellion. He knew most of the Aspre Plunge staff by name, and was on good terms with them as he was regarded as a good tipper. During his [[Time/Legends|time]] on Spira, Cambriel retrofitted the ''Cambus Gale'' from a pleasure craft to a racing yacht, spending money to rerig the sails, reshape the [[Hull/Legends|hull]] and generally overhaul her to the point where she was a competitive racer.<ref name=\"TSR\" />\n\nDuring the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], an Alliance-affiliated [[Unidentified smuggler (Spira)|smuggler]] attempting to deliver supplies to a [[drop point]] on the planet was discovered by local Imperial forces. The smuggler ditched the cargo in the [[Ocean/Legends|ocean]] and fled the planet with [[GAT-12 Skipray Blastboat|Skipray Blastboats]] in pursuit. Alerted to the incident, Cambriel, along with Taft, located the cargo and hid it in [[the wreck]], an [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Starship/Legends|starship]] of unknown origin that had crashed on the planet thousands of [[Standard year/Legends|years]] previously and had become a popular tourist [[Diver|diving]] spot. A Rebel team was subsequently sent to retrieve the supplies, and Cambriel was their contact on planet. He reserved them a modest room at the Aspre Plunge for the duration of their stay, and briefed them on the mission when they arrived and met him in the casino. Yet, due to the [[345th annual Spira Regatta Open]] taking place, the wreck was off-limits to tourist vessels, as it was on the [[Regatta Route|race route]]. Since only official race competitors were allowed on the racing route during the event, the team would have to pose as entrants to the [[Spira Regatta Open|race]], as they could not afford an extra [[Standard week/Legends|week's]] delay in retrieving the cargo. Cambriel entered them into the competition aboard his own ''Cambus Gale'' and planned to [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggle]] a [[sailing droid]] aboard, which was illegal under race rules, to assist in crewing the vessel. However, Cambriel felt there would be no problem in reaching the cargo and retrieving the supplies despite the race taking place. The real problem would be smuggling the cargo off-planet since only [[Passenger liner/Legends|passenger liners]], authorized [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]], and Imperial vessels were allowed to land on Spira. Cambriel's solution was to discourage investigation of the cargo and ship it out on a registered passenger liner by hiding the supplies in a crate containing the body of a [[Camray eel]]. The Camray eel was native to Spira, and a popular trophy for big-game [[Hunting/Legends|hunters]]. However, until they were preserved correctly by a [[taxidermist]], the dead eel gave off an extremely potent and disgusting smell, necessitating their encasement in a special storage tank. [[Customs Inspector]]s were reluctant to give crates with Camray eel remains a thorough inspection.<ref name=\"TSR\" />\n\n{{RPGseed}}\n[[File:Spira.jpg|thumb|left|The Rebel agents hunt a Camray eel.]]\nHowever, first the agents would have to hunt and capture an eel. As they would also have to learn to sail a [[Boat/Legends|nautical vessel]], Cambriel suggested that they combine the two activities by sailing the boat out to the [[Shinkai Abyss]], the eel's primary habitat. With the race due to begin in two days' time, Cambriel assisted the agents in gathering equipment and weapons for the mission, offering them the use of his own weapons cache which contained [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistols]] and [[Blaster rifle/Legends|rifles]], [[Grenade/Legends|grenades]], and several [[blaster speargun]]s he had borrowed from the local Imperial [[Aquatic assault stormtrooper|Seatrooper]] armory. He also provided them with [[diving suit]]s and other equipment needed to operate [[Water/Legends|underwater]]. The group successfully hunted and [[Death/Legends|killed]] a Camray eel in the Shinkai Abyss, and trained for the two days on the ''Cambus Gale'' alongside Cambriel and [[Seth Cambriel's WBY-102 FirstMate droid|his sailing droid]].<ref name=\"TSR\" />\n\nOn the first day of the race, Cambriel was careful to hide the sailing [[Droid/Legends|droid]] he had been using to instruct the Rebel agents aboard the ''Cambus Gale'', and the team set off along the racing route for the ten-day journey that it would take to circumnavigate the planet. On the third day of racing, the agents noticed that the pace of the boat was slowing, and Cambriel informed them that a [[Galub slug]] had probably attached itself to the underside of the hull and the weight was slowing the vessel down. The agents cleared the sea slug from the boat by blasting it several times until it detached, and continued racing. After weathering [[the Point]], a treacherous section of the ocean where two strong currents met at the southernmost point of [[Spira's largest island]], the ''Cambus Gale'' arrived at the wreck on the eighth day. Cambriel provided the agents with a [[Plastic/Legends|plastic]] divers' [[Map/Legends|map]] and told them where he and Taft had stashed the supplies aboard the derelict craft. During the recovery operation, a modified Imperial [[AQ-5 Waveskimmer]] arrived, bearing [[Regenald Hanniper Snopps III]], the son of [[Corulag/Legends|Corulag]] [[Governor/Legends|governor]] [[Zafiel Snopps]], and a guard of several Seatroopers. Snopps demanded that the crew leave the area as he wanted to inspect the wreck despite the fact that it was off-limits to tourists during the race, using the fact that he had connections within the Empire that would allow him to disregard local laws and edicts. Despite the interruption, the Rebels managed to recover the supplies and left the area.<ref name=\"TSR\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\nThe ''Cambus Gale'' eventually completed the race, placing almost last ahead of two boats that had encountered difficulties during the race. The loss was a blow to Cambriel's reputation, but one that he gladly accepted under the circumstances. His plan to smuggle the supplies off-world worked as predicted; sealed in plastic bags and concealed in [[coolant chip]]s inside the Camray eel storage tank, the supplies escaped the notice of the inspectors, who only gave the tank a cursory inspection.<ref name=\"TSR\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Well, he's certainly got the plum job, eh? We're supposed to meet him in the Aspre Plunge casino on Ataria Island, right? I've heard ''legends'' about the card games that go down in that place.|A Rebel agent reflects of Cambriel's choice assignment|The Spira Regatta}}\nSeth Cambriel was a tall, handsome man with thinning [[Color/Legends|blond]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]]. Outgoing and laid back, he was regarded as a generous and likeable individual, and he was able to accept blows to his own ego when it was for the greater good of the Alliance. A natural sportsman, Cambriel was a gifted sailor who could operate and repair sailed vessels, and he was a skilled swimmer and diver. He could use a [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] and carried a [[Sporting blaster|sporting variant]] about his person; he was trained in [[Unarmed combat|unarmed]] and [[Melee weapon/Legends|melee combat]] as well. A skilled businessmen, Cambriel used his abilities to accrue a multi-million credit fortune. He was knowledgeable about [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucratic]] procedure and was extremely well connected in Spira society. A skilled [[Gambling/Legends|gambler]], Cambriel was also a shrewd bargainer and could be persuasive when he needed to be. A talented spy and investigator, he successfully managed a network of informants who had no idea of his true allegiance. He could [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] craft, and could operate communications and security equipment. He was also trained in [[Computer/Legends|computer]] programming and repair and first aid. He generally wore dapper, but practical clothing and carried a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]].<ref name=\"TSR\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Regenald_Hanniper_Snopps_III.jpg|thumb|right|Regenald Hanniper Snopps III, the character's prospective antagonist during ''The Spira Regatta'']]\nSeth Cambriel first appeared in ''[[The Spira Regatta]]'', a [[Roleplaying game|roleplaying]] adventure written by [[Paul Sudlow]] and published in [[West End Games]]' [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 1|''Star Wars Adventure Journal'' 1]] in [[1994]]. The illustration of Cambriel was provided by [[Doug Shuler]]. The adventure was later reprinted in [[1996]]'s ''[[The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4]]''. During ''The Spira Regatta'', if the players do not think of combining their attempts to learn to sail with the hunting of a Camray eel, then Cambriel suggests uniting the two exercises to save time. Cambriel is also used to supply the players with necessary equipment, such as diving gear, as the players are unable to bring large stores of equipment with them due to strict [[Imperial Office of Customs/Legends|Imperial Customs]] checks on the planet. The final encounter of the adventure, in which the agents attempt to raise the supplies and are confronted with Snopps and his Seatrooper escort, can be played out in several ways. Snopps can be encountered by the players at several points earlier in the adventure, such as in the Aspre Plunge casino, or on a boat in the Shinkai Abyss where he and several friends are attempting to kill a Camray eel with grenades. The gamemaster has the option of using these encounters to build Snopps into an antagonistic presence for the players, leading to a tenser encounter in the finale.\n\nThe players have two main options: fight or bluff. The adventure outright states that a bluff has a better chance of working against Snopps and his escort, and that the Imperial force is favored in any [[Lightfight|firefight]]. Each Seatrooper is a crack [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]], and in the event of a fight, the crew of the Waveskimmer close the hatches and simply ram the ''Cambus Gale'' until it sinks. A well-thought-out and executed plan has the chance of succeeding at the gamemasters' discretion, but the characters face difficulty in leaving the planet due to an investigation into the ship's disappearance. The bluff option is more feasible, as Snopps is noted as being less than bright and his escort barely tolerate him. Unless lawbreaking or violence against him is likely, the Seatroopers do not intercede on his behalf. Indeed, even if the Rebel agents surface with the supplies while the confrontation is ongoing and are sufficiently convincing, they can bluff Snopps and the Seatroopers. Even if there is some doubt as to their intentions, the Seatroopers are likely to dismiss any weird goings-on if they sense that Snopps is being hoodwinked due to their distaste of him. Other options include the Rebel divers waiting out the encounter in the wreck, or hiding under the hull of the yacht itself. Snopps may also become bored if he believes that others are laughing behind his back and leave the area. Snopps' reaction to the players is tied directly to their previous dealings, and the gamemaster should tailor the encounter accordingly. This article assumes that the Rebel agents retrieved the supplies to complete the adventure, but does not specify which method was employed.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|1|The Spira Regatta}} {{1st}}\n*{{WEGCite|book=The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal, Issues 1-4|story=The Spira Regatta}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cambriel, Seth}}\n[[Category:Alliance Intelligence members]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Sailors]]\n[[Category:Spies]]\n[[Category:Spira residents]]"}}}]}}}}
