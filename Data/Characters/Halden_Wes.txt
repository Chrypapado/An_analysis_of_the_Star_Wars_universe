The adventurer discovered that the Meatlumps had established camps near the cities of [[Tyrena/Legends|Tyrena]], [[Kor Vella/Legends|Kor Vella]] and [[Doaba Guerfel/Legends|Doaba Guerfel]] on Corellia, [[Nashal]] on [[Talus/Legends|Talus]], [[Theed/Legends|Theed]] and [[Moenia/Legends|Moenia]] on [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], [[Narmle (city)|Narmle]] on [[Rori/Legends|Rori]], [[Nym's Stronghold]] on [[Lok/Legends|Lok]], and near [[Wayfar]] and [[Mos Taike/Legends|Mos Taike]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. Halden Wes and the spacer realized that the Meatlumps had gathered large amounts of supplies to those camps, including food, weapons and explosives. As it appeared that the criminals were planning important operations on those worlds, the spacer suggested warning the authorities, while the ambitious Wes argued they could get credit, and ''Corellia Times'' as well, for foiling the Meatlump plans. The reporter finally paid the adventurer a good price to raid the Meatlump camps. The spacer therefore traveled to those worlds, attacked the Meatlumps and sacked the camps.<ref name=\"SWG:MtM\">{{SWGcite|exp=TCOA|type=general|Muddle the Meatlumps|Corellia}}</ref>\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHalden Wes was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|non-player character]] in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', a [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"SWG:MHYFT\" /> prior to its closure on [[December 15]], [[2011]].<ref name=\"Shutdown\">{{SonyCite|url=playerinfo|text=IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ''STAR WARS'' GALAXIES\u2122|archivedate=20111124020123}}</ref> Halden Wes was added to the game with the update dubbed \"[[W:c:swg:Chapter 10|Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King]],\" released on [[June 19]], [[2008]].<ref>{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67812&month=062008|text=Chapter 10: The Search for the Meatlump King|archivedate=20110924005831}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|The Complete Online Adventures}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{SonyCite|url=players/news_archive.vm?id=67782&month=052008|text=Meatlumps!|archivedate=20080602115039}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Meatlumps Hideout: Your First Time}}\n*{{SWGWiki|Muddle the Meatlumps}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wes, Halden}}\n[[Category:Corellians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Journalists]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
