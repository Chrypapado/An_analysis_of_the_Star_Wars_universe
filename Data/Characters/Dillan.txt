Their secret Enclave caused a lot of hardship for us during the war.|Dillan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\n'''Dillan''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] who lived on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] prior to and during the [[Jedi Civil War]] and in the years following. It was she who first greeted [[Meetra Surik]] and her companions upon their initial arrival on that [[Planet/Legends|world]], informing the former Jedi of the planet's history since her departure for the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. She would later join the [[Khoonda Militia]], defending the outpost there from the [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]] working for the former [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith trooper]], [[Azkul]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:DillanBattleDress.png|thumb|left|125px|Dillan, during the battle for Khoonda]]\n{{Quote|The only recent visitors we've had on Dantooine have been salvagers. And a slew of mercenaries. We get a lot of that here, too. Ever since the Enclave got slagged, seems half the people that visit are smugglers or worse.|Dillan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nThe [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|female]] Dillan lived on Dantooine her entire life. She received firsthand experience with the planet's rocky history since the start of the [[Mandalorian Wars]]. Dillan had little regard for the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] that had once maintained an [[Jedi Enclave|enclave]] not far from the [[Khoonda]] outpost, blaming them for the [[Darth Revan's Sith Empire|Sith Empire's]] [[Attack on Dantooine (Jedi Civil War)|invasion]] and occupation of her world as well as the problems with [[Mandalorian/Legends|Mandalorian]] raiders prior to that conflict. In [[3954 BBY]], she greeted a [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Exile (punishment)/Legends|Exile]] named [[Meetra Surik]], who visited Dantooine with an entourage of companions. Curious at first as to who Surik and her companions were, Dillan eventually warned her that she would find little welcome within the Khoonda outpost that was the seat of government for the struggling colony, stating that many citizens also held the Jedi in a dim light. She went on to explain the general situation on Dantooine, informing Surik of the situation between the settlers of Khoonda, the [[Scavenger/Legends|salvagers]] who hoped to plunder the ruins of the [[Jedi Enclave]], and the problems that both groups had with the [[Sith trooper (Sith Empire)|Sith trooper]] [[Azkul]]'s [[Mercenary/Legends|mercenaries]].\n\n{{Gamemechanics}}\nSometime later, Dillan joined the [[Khoonda Militia]] at the behest of Surik, reasoning that she would have had a far worse job than the one she currently held if the mercenaries took over Dantooine. When Azkul and his men finally [[Battle of Khoonda|attacked]] the Khoonda outpost, she fought alongside Surik, [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Vrook Lamar]] and the rest of the militia.\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Haven't you caused enough trouble here? Most of us would be just as glad if your kind never came back. And the rest would just as soon see you killed. With the Exchange bounty on Jedi, you'd be smart to keep your identity secret.|Dillan|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nDillan was a pragmatic woman who liked to greet the crew of incoming [[Starship/Legends|starships]]. Like most residents of Khoonda, she held a low opinion of the Jedi, citing their presence on Dantooine as the reason the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] under [[Darth Malak]] invaded and sacked most of the communities of her homeworld in addition to [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombarding]] the Jedi Enclave there into rubble. Like most survivors of the short but brutal occupation that followed, Dillan became jaded in her views not only of the Jedi, but of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] itself. Most residents, her included, knew that in the wake of the devastating [[Jedi Civil War]], the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Senate]] could ill afford to lend support to such a remote colony world despite its strategic value. She was, however, dedicated to her community, and unwilling to let it fall under mercenary rule if she could help prevent it.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nDillan's only appearance in ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[canon]] has been in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''. Her reaction to Surik's arrival depends on a number of factors, for example whether or not Surik is carrying a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] when the two meet, or what conversation choices the player makes. Essentially, she serves as a greeter of sorts for the player's first visit.\n\nWhile the player does not have to recruit her into the militia in order to advance the plot, for 100% game completion in the game, Dillan is indeed recruited. If the player takes the dark path throughout the game, Dillan is not recruited into the militia, and the Exile sides with the mercenaries ordered to take over the planet. Curiously, when Dillan is seen during the fight within Khoonda, she is wearing the same clothing as a [[Czerka Arms/Legends|Czerka Corporation]] [[Unidentified Czerka Corporation protocol officer|protocol officer]] from the [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|prequel game]], which is ironic considering they have the same head.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n[[Category:Dantooinians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Khoonda Militiamen]]"}}}]}}}}
