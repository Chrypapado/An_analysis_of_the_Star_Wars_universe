She was quite skilled in repairing machinery of all types, from [[Speeder/Legends|speeders]] to [[Droid/Legends|droids]], to [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] [[Limb/Legends|limbs]].\n\n==Biography==\nMora's family was killed when the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] took control of M'haeli. Mora was orphaned and adopted by a kind-hearted [[H'drachi]] seer named [[Ch'no]] who raised her as his own, and Mora became quite adept at scrounging for and repairing junk, eventually gaining a reputation as a skilled [[Technician/Legends|mechanic]].\n\nWhen Mora turned eighteen, she was working as a mechanic when she caught the [[Eye/Legends|eye]] of a young Imperial Officer, [[Ranulf Trommer/Legends|Ranulf Trommer]] who had been sent to her by governor [[Grigor (governor)|Grigor]] with a damaged [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] in need of repair. Grigor, suspecting Trommer was sent to [[Spy/Legends|spy]] on him, intended to eliminate Trommer as a rebel operative in a raid on Mora's shop. However, real rebels, including [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], whom Mora (unaware that she's Padm\u00e9's daughter) recognized her from her wanted posters, had already approached Mora for her technical skills in order to have her modify a number of [[Asteroid-3 Swoop Racer|Asteroid-3]] swoops. When [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] swept in to arrest Trommer, Mora fought back, with the nearby rebels joining in. Afterward, Trommer and Mora fled her shop with the rebels, and together they sabotaged Grigor's [[dragite crystal]] mine and left to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].\n\n{{Char-stub}}\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: River of Chaos]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Mora.jpg|thumb|right|Mora.]]\n*{{InsiderCite|25|The Horse's Mouth|Straight from the Horse's Mouth}} {{1stm}} {{Imo}}\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Droids]]''\n*''[[The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons]]''\n*{{FFCite|93|WID1-2, ''Widget''}}\n*{{FFCite|101|WID3-4, ''Widget''}}\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Mora\n}}\n\n[[Category:Alliance to Restore the Republic members]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:M'haeli residents]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"}}}]}}}}
