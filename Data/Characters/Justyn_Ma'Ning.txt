Ma'Ning was middle-aged, balding, and had a deep voice; he was most noted for taking part in the [[Outbound Flight Project]]. Under the command of Master [[Jorus C'baoth]], whom he often clashed with, he was charged to oversee the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] aboard ''[[Dreadnaught-Four]]''. During his participation on ''[[Outbound Flight]]'', Master Ma'Ning was killed by the [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] sent by order of [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], Justyn Ma'Ning was [[Jedi training/Legends|trained]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]]. Achieving the rank of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]], Jedi Ma'Ning would be one of five Masters selected to accompany Master [[Jorus C'baoth]] aboard ''Outbound Flight'' as part of the Outbound Flight Project\u2014one that would see a large group of Jedi and colonists travel aboard a massive colony ship to the edge of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] and beyond, cataloging new discoveries and hopefully locating the lost Jedi [[Vergere]].<ref name=\"OF\" />\n\nPlaced in command of ''[[Dreadnaught-Four]]'', Master Ma'Ning outwardly supported the commands of the lord-like Master C'baoth, all the while questioning the need for the Jedi to cultivate more power for themselves over the non-Jedi colonists aboard the flight. Master Ma'Ning grew increasingly concerned for Master C'baoth when the obsessive man began to separate families based on their connection to the Force. Even so, with the numbers of Jedi peacekeeping forces spread critically thin in the perilous times in which they lived, Master Ma'Ning agreed that the Jedi needed to sustain and bolster their numbers by training new recruits. Ma'Ning only voiced his concerns to [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Lorana Jinzler]], who agreed to speak with her master about Ma'Ning's concerns, but the Master eventually confronted C'baoth himself. Accusing C'baoth of becoming more of a ruler than a sage, Master Ma'Ning's accusations were met with incredulous disdain. As a result, Ma'Ning ordered the convening of a [[Judgment Circle]] against C'baoth, to take place just as soon as an imminent threat had been dealt with.<ref name=\"OF\" />\n\nFor as Ma'Ning moved to remove C'baoth from command, ''Outbound Flight'' was attacked by a [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] task force under the command of [[Force Commander]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo/Legends|Mitth'raw'nuruodo]] ([[Core name/Legends|core-named]] \"Thrawn\"). Unable therefore to convene the Judgment Circle, the Jedi rushed to their battle stations. But they were severely overwhelmed by the precision of the Chiss. During the initial attack, Master Ma'Ning was caught in an explosion and buried beneath the molten bulkhead. As he lay dying, Ma'Ning summoned Jedi Knight Jinzler to his side and warned her that C'baoth had fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]]. Encouraging Jinzler to take as many passengers as she could muster to the massive ship's central core, he predicted that they would have the best chance of survival there. With his last breath, Master Ma'Ning reminded Jinzler of her duty as a Jedi to serve others, before he succumbed to his injuries and became one with the Force.<ref name=\"OF\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']] {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Justyn Ma'Ning\n|hu=Justyn Ma'Ning\n|ru=\u0414\u0436\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0430'\u041d\u0438\u043d\u0433\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ma'Ning, Justyn}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Outbound Flight residents]]\n[[Category:Post-Ruusan Jedi Masters]]"}}}]}}}}
