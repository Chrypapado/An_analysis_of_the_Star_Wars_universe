Considered to be amongst the wisest and most patient in the Order, she was a skilled fighter and devoted believer in the ways of the Jedi. During the [[Clone Wars]], a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Ti took part in the pivotal battles of [[First Battle of Geonosis|Geonosis]], [[Battle of Kamino|Kamino]], and [[Battle of Coruscant|Coruscant]] as a [[Jedi General|general]] for the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].\n\nEarly in the Clone Wars, she was chosen to represent the Republic on [[Kamino]], where she personally oversaw the training and development of [[Clone trooper|clone forces]]. While in this role, she became entangled in a conspiracy surrounding the origins of the organic [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] placed in every clone, and the secrets being kept from the Jedi about them. As she attempted to root out the conspiracy from [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC Trooper]] [[CT-5555|Fives]], she clashed with [[Kaminoan]] [[Chief Medical Scientist]] [[Nala Se]], who was attempting to dispel his claims regarding the chips' true purpose. Despite her efforts to the contrary, Ti was unable to help Fives as he suffered a breakdown, and upon his death, his secrets passed on to only a few. Ti had a tenuous relationship with the Kaminoan leadership during this time, finding difficulty in working with their emotionless demeanor and struggling to balance her compassion for the clones with the demand of producing capable soldiers for war.\n\nAs the war began to draw to a close, Ti and the Council became increasingly aware of the mystery behind the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]], devoting much time to discovering their identity and motives. During the Battle of Coruscant in the [[Outer Rim Sieges|late stages]] of the Clone Wars, Ti was sent to protect [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] but was knocked unconscious in a duel with Separatist General [[Grievous]]. At the war's end Ti became a victim of the [[Great Jedi Purge]], [[Death|murdered]] at the hands of fallen Jedi [[Anakin Skywalker]] whilst she [[Meditation|meditated]] during the [[Siege of the Jedi Temple]]. Prior to her death Ti recorded a message of hope on a [[holocron]], urging its [[Luke Skywalker|finder]] to not let the fall of the Order be the end of the Jedi.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nShaak Ti was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Shili]].<ref name=\"USW\" /> Identified as a [[Force-sensitive]] individual, [[Gender|she]] joined the [[Jedi Order]] and eventually gained the rank of [[Jedi Master|Master]].<ref name=\"Secrets of the Jedi\" /> At some point following the [[Battle of Naboo]], she gained a seat on the [[Jedi High Council]],<ref name=\"Attack of the Clones\" /> taking the place of Master [[Yaddle]], who had chosen to retire from the body and take a less active role in Jedi affairs.<ref name=\"VE\">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref>\n\n===Onset of the Clone Wars===\n====The road to war====\n[[File:Jedicouncil2.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|Ti and the Jedi Council meeting with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker]]\nThe [[Galactic Republic]] was in a state of turmoil during this [[time]], as the [[Separatist Crisis|Separatist Movement]], led by former [[Jedi]] [[Count]] [[Dooku]], threatened the stability of the Republic. The Secessionist Movement led to debate over the creation of a military force to combat an impending war. After the attempted [[Plot to assassinate Padm\u00e9 Amidala|assassination]] of [[Naboo]]'s [[Senator]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], Ti and the other members of the [[Jedi Council]] assigned [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to investigate the assassination attempts while his [[Padawan]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], protected the senator. Ti was present in the Jedi Archives when Kenobi was researching the planet Kamino, which he believed had a connection to Amidala's would-be [[assassin]]. Upon [[Mission to Kamino (Separatist Crisis)|arriving]] to the planet, Kenobi learned that the deceased Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]] had, [[Standard year|years]] earlier, secretly ordered a [[Clone trooper|clone army]] from the [[Kaminoan]]s with the help of a man named Tyranus. On Kamino, Kenobi found a bounty hunter named [[Jango Fett]], whom the clones were created from, and believed him to be Amidala's attempted assassin. Later, while following Fett to [[Geonosis]], Kenobi discovered that the Separatists were creating [[Separatist Droid Army|their own army]] made up of droids, but was captured by Dooku's forces moments after contacting the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] to report his findings. Skywalker and Amidala, who were on the nearby planet of [[Tatooine]], unsuccessfully attempted to rescue him, leading to their capture.<ref name=\"Attack of the Clones\" />\n\n====Battle of Geonosis====\n[[File:Jedi_fighting_battle_droids.jpg|thumb|right|220x220px|Shaak Ti and Pablo-Jill fight battle droids at Geonosis]]\nTi participated in the [[First Battle of Geonosis]], the conflict that sparked the [[Clone Wars]] between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]]. As a participant, she was a part of the [[Jedi assault team|group of 212 Jedi]] assembled by fellow Jedi Council member [[Mace Windu]] to rescue Kenobi, Skywalker, and Amidala from being [[Death|executed]] by the Separatists at [[Petranaki Arena]] on Geonosis and crush the Separatist army. Upon arriving at Geonosis, the assault team infiltrated the arena and hid, waiting for the right [[time]] to strike. When Windu made the Jedi's presence known, every Jedi ignited their lightsabers and revealed themselves. Ti and Master [[Luminara Unduli]] ignited their lightsabers simultaneously, and quickly joined the battle. Dooku unleashed hordes of [[battle droid]]s to counterattack the Jedi, who were quickly overwhelmed. The onslaught resulted in the deaths of nearly the entire assault team, with the surviving Jedi, including Ti, encircled by Dooku's forces. The [[Separatist Droid Army|Droid Army]] was ready to end the survivors when [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] arrived with the newly deployed [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Several [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|LAAT/i]] gunships formed a perimeter around the Jedi.<ref name=\"Attack of the Clones\" /> Ti, Unduli, and Master [[Saesee Tiin]] boarded a gunship and were airlifted out of the arena and brought to the front lines of the battle, where the clone army was in combat with the Separatist forces.<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> Once there, Ti was among many Jedi who led the assault on the Separatist [[core ship]]s. Ti fought alongside Windu on the battlefront, cutting down droids and helping the clones push the Separatist armies back.<ref name=\"On the Front Lines\">''[[Star Wars: On the Front Lines]]''</ref> With the clone's help, the Jedi successfully rescued Kenobi, Skywalker, and Amidala, and won the ensuing battle.<ref name=\"Attack of the Clones\" />\n\nShortly following the clash on Geonosis, Separatist forces established footholds on various worlds in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. Seeking to ascertain the reason for a Separatist presence on [[Hissrich]], Ti and the Council sent Windu, along with a [[Mace Windu's squad|covert team]] of Jedi, to investigate the planet.<ref name=\"Mace Windu 1\">[[Jedi of the Republic &ndash; Mace Windu 1|''Jedi of the Republic &ndash; Mace Windu'' 1]]</ref>\n\n===Deployment to Kamino===\n====Clone training initiative====\n{{Quote|I am a Jedi, where the individual and the group are one and the same&mdash;much like you clones.''\"<br />\"''Which is why Fives and I are looking out for each other.''\"<br />\"''As individuals, but ''not'' as a group.

Her primary role was to oversee the cloning initiative, which included training the clone forces for combat.<ref name=\"Secrets of the Jedi\">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Jedi]]''</ref> She worked alongside two [[bounty hunter]]s contracted by the Republic, [[Master Chief]] [[Bric]] and [[El-Les]]. Ti and the bounty hunters were tasked with conducting training exercises for cadets.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" /> Ti's sympathetic nature contrasted greatly with the Kaminoan's cold view of the clones are property, as she treated cadets as individuals rather than organic products.<ref name=\"Join the Battle\" /> Throughout her deployment, Ti worked closely with the Kaminoan leadership, including [[Prime Minister]] [[Lama Su]],<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" /> [[Chief Medical Scientist]] [[Nala Se]],<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" /> and Su's administrative [[aide]], [[Taun We]].<ref name=\"Taun We SWE\">{{SWE|characters|taunwe|Taun We}}</ref> In addition to her mentorship role, she organized the planet's defenses<ref name=\"Join the Battle\" /> and was the commanding officer of the [[Kamino security|Kamino security force]].<ref name=\"Fugitive\">{{TCW|Fugitive}}</ref> At some point, Ti flew her [[Shaak Ti's Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|Eta-2 ''Actis''-class light interceptor]] while on Kamino.<ref name=\"FFG Eta-2\" />\n\nOne clone training group, [[Domino Squad]], was ineffective in following protocol and working as a team. Ti, Bric, and El-Les presided over their pre-graduation exercises in the [[Citadel Challenge]]. Following one such failed exercise, Bric implied that the group were \"rejects,\" and should be demoted to sanitation detail. El-Les was more sympathetic and wanted Domino [[Squad]] to continue training. Ti, although disagreeing with his sentiment, agreed with Bric that the squad was not ready for combat. She ended the test and requested that maintenance clone [[Clone 99|99]] send a cleaning crew to the training ground.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\">{{TCW|Clone Cadets}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EchoFivesRequestTramsfer-CC.png|thumb|right|227x227px|Ti with Fives and Echo during their training.]]\nTi later conversed with the Kaminoan Prime Minister, Lama Su, on the squad's ineffectiveness. Su recommended that the Republic find another donor for the cloning process, believing that the squad's failure was a genetic malfunction. He suggested rejecting the squad, by means of termination, an idea Ti strongly opposed. Su ultimately left the final decision of their consequence up to Ti as she was in charge of training. The squad failed their graduation testing, and despite Bric's opposition El-Les sent a request to Ti asking she allow the squad to retake the test. She was later approached by two members of Domino Squad, [[CT-5555]], \"Fives,\" and [[Echo|CT-1409]], \"Echo,\" who asked for a transfer to another squad. Sensing their stress, Ti disapproved of their plea and told them that when in battle, they should fight as a group, not as individuals. She told them that she had decided to allow them to retake the test.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" />\n\nIn the early stages of their final exercise, the squad worked as a team and managed to proceed further than they had before. Upon reaching the citadel, however, they realized that the ascension cables needed to scale it were missing. Bric revealed that he had removed them in hopes that they would fail. El-Les protested that Ti end the test because Bric's actions made it unfair, but she denied his request, stating that adversity would be a constant in war and that the Separatists wouldn't play fair either. Despite Bric's efforts, the squad managed to overcome their disability and complete the test by scaling the tower using the wall-mounted turrets. Having successfully proven themselves and passed their final exercise, Ti graduated them to the Grand Army of the Republic.<ref name=\"Clone Cadets\" />\n\n====Battle of Kamino====\n{{Quote|The droids are spread thin. We must press our offensive now!|Shaak Ti|ARC Troopers}}\n[[File:WelcomeToKamino-ARCT.png|left|thumb|250px|Shaak Ti greets Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker on Kamino.]]\nAfter the Republic intercepted a message between Separatist [[General]] [[Grievous]] and assassin [[Asajj Ventress]] discussing a planned [[Battle of Kamino|attack]] on Kamino,<ref name=\"ARC Troopers\">{{TCW|ARC Troopers}}</ref> Ti began coordinating forces on the planet to defend against the imminent attack.<ref name=\"Join the Battle\" /> Kenobi and Skywalker were assigned to join the defenses with reinforcements, and Ti and Su met them when they landed at Tipoca [[City]]. Ti welcomed the pair to Kamino while Su expressed doubt that an attack would take place, as he believed that the Republic [[Kamino blockade|blockade]] was far too strong. A [[Confederacy of Independent Systems Navy|Separatist fleet]] soon arrived and engaged the blockade. As the two fleets began to clash, Ti monitored the progress of the battle from Tipoca City's control room alongside Kenobi, Su, [[Captain]] [[Rex]], and [[Commander]] [[CC-2224|Cody]]. She noted that the Separatist [[fleet]] was not large enough to defeat the blockade, and ordered Skywalker to lead the Republic's fighters in assaulting the enemy. Several [[Munificent-class star frigate|''Munificent''-class star frigates]] were destroyed protecting Grievous' [[flagship]], with their debris crashing in the [[ocean]] near Tipoca City. Ti pointed out the unusual tactic to Kenobi. Kenobi became concerned that the battle was too easy, and left Ti and the others to investigate the wreckage in the ocean beneath the city. He discovered [[AQ-series battle droid]]s assembling [[Trident-class assault ship|''Trident''-class assault ships]] underwater but was unable to warn the city before the [[droid]]s began their assault.<ref name=\"ARC Troopers\" />\n\n[[File:TiDefendsHangar-ARCT.png|thumb|right|221x221px|Shaak Ti leads the clone troopers in pushing the battle droids back to the main hangar.|left]]\nTi continued to monitor the battle with Su as Grievous and his forces joined in on the ground battle. When the control room came under assault by several Aqua droids, Ti quickly dispatched them and contacted the other Jedi, warning that the attacking droids were spread thin throughout the city and that the Republic needed to press their counterattack quickly. While Kenobi engaged Grievous and Skywalker hunted down Ventress, who attempted to steal a genetic sample of the clone's [[DNA]], Ti led the clone troopers in pushing the droids back to Tipoca City's main [[hangar]]. As the remaining aqua droids were rounded up and destroyed, Ti contacted Cody to inform him of the progress made. The clone forces were soon able to corner Ventress, though she managed to escape with Grievous on an escape pod without the DNA.<ref name=\"ARC Troopers\" />\n\n====Serving the Council====\nWhen the Jedi received a nearly 2,000-year-old distress code, Ti and the Council sent Kenobi, Skywalker, and his [[Padawan]], [[Ahsoka Tano]], to the [[Chrelythiumn system]], where they were to investigate the signal and rendezvous with a star cruiser helmed by Rex. Despite having the correct coordinates, the three Jedi could not find the other ship and became trapped in an [[Mortis|otherworldly plane]].<ref name=\"Overlords\">{{TCW|Overlords}}</ref> They later managed to leave and complete their rendezvous.<ref name=\"Ghosts of Mortis\">{{TCW|Ghosts of Mortis}}</ref> Sometime later, while in the face of a Separatist invasion, the Togrutan [[Gupat Roshti|governor]] of [[Kiros]] decided to negotiate with Dooku, knowing that Republic aid would arrive too late. Kenobi and Skywalker arrived with their entourages, only to discover that the Togrutan colonists were relocated by the Separatists. When Ti and the Council learned of this, they dispatched Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, and Rex with finding the colonists and rescuing them.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\">{{TCW|Kidnapped}}</ref> \n\n[[File:RebelsAndTheCouncil-AWOTF.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Shaak Ti attends the meeting with the Onderon rebels via hologram]]\nNot long after it was discovered that Dooku and criminal mastermind [[Moralo Eval]] had a plot to kidnap Palpatine at the [[Festival of Light]] on Naboo, Ti and the rest of the Council arranged for Kenobi to go undercover as bounty hunter [[Rako Hardeen]] to stop Eval and Dooku from succeeding. Ti attended the faux [[Funeral of Obi-Wan Kenobi|funeral of Kenobi]], standing alongside Windu and [[Satine Kryze]] of [[Mandalore]].<ref name=\"Deception\">{{TCW|Deception}}</ref> She later attended a meeting held by Windu, where he discussed the security being put in place during the festival.

They reached out to the Council, asking for support. Ti and her fellow Council members were wary, as the rebel's [[Onderonian Civil War|fight]] did not involve the Republic, and sending aid would earn the Jedi scrutiny from the Senate. Nonetheless, the Council sent Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, and Rex to train the rebels in secret.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\">{{TCW|A War on Two Fronts}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TempleBombingFuneral.png|thumb|right|220x220px|Shaak Ti and the Council at the funeral for the Jedi killed in the bombing]]\nFollowing the [[bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar]], Ti and the Council met to discuss who the culprit could be. Windu entertained the idea that the bomber could be a rogue Jedi, and assigned Skywalker and Tano to investigate. Their investigation led to the arrest of [[Letta Turmond]], who had fed [[NM-K reconstitutor|nano-droid]] explosives to her unwitting [[Jackar Bowmani|husband]], a worker in the Temple.<ref name=\"Sabotage\">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)}}</ref> Ti later attended the [[Funeral of the Jedi Temple bombing victims|funeral for the six Jedi killed]] in the bombing. Following the services, Ti and the Council met to listen to Kenobi's report on the Separatist activity on [[Saleucami]]. His report was cut short by [[Admiral]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], who told those present of Turmond's request to speak to Tano. Tano met with the prisoner, and in a startling turn of events, Turmond was killed and Tano was on the run, blamed for her murder.<ref name=\"TJWKTM\">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref> Ti attended the Council meeting in which Tarkin accused Tano of masterminding the attack, causing Ti to exchange a shocked look with [[Kit Fisto]].<ref name=\"TCAJ\">{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ChamberOfJudgement-TWJ.png|thumb|220x220px|Shaak Ti stood next to Kenobi during Ahsoka Tano's trial|left]]\nAfter [[Capture of Ahsoka Tano|Tano's capture]], Tarkin requested that the Council expel Tano from the Order so that a military trial could take place, free of what he believed to be a bias among the Jedi. Fearing that a refusal would be seen as an act of sedition, the Council reluctantly agreed. Ti was one of the judges during Tano's trial in the [[Chamber of Judgment]], where the young Padawan was expelled from the Jedi Order and stripped of her [[Military rank|ranks]] within the Grand Army of the Republic. Skywalker ultimately proved Tano's innocence, revealing that it was Padawan [[Barriss Offee]] who had become disillusioned with the Order, gave Turmond the nano-droids, and framed Tano for it all. The Council apologized to Tano and offered her a chance to rejoin, though she refused and left the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"The Wrong Jedi\">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>\n\n====Clone conspiracy====\n{{Quote|I can't believe Fives would try to assassinate the Chancellor.''\"<br />\"''The Kaminoans feel a virus corrupted his inhibitor chip, which has led to this behavior.

He was accompanied by Rex and Fives, whom Ti, still stationed on the ocean world, met with shortly after their arrival. As they accompanied the sedated Tup to an examination room, Ti informed Rex that he was needed back on the battlefront and sent Fives for an examination, as he was close with Tup and any information gathered would be beneficial to the investigation. Ti and Kaminoan doctor Nala Se then began their testing on Tup. Se conducted a hyper test, a practice Ti was not fond of. During the tests, Tup began shaking violently, which a concerned Fives noticed from the neighboring examination room. Ti shuttered the viewing window between rooms so that Fives would not panic. The tests yielded nothing, and Se's readings showed him to be in perfect health. Ti suggested that they missed something and asked if he was conscious only for Tup to look at her and violently mutter \"kill the Jedi\" before Se sedated him. Ti and Se were at a loss and the two had no answers.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" />\n\n[[File:JediCouncil-Conspiracy.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Ti asks the Council how they wish her to proceed with the examination]]\nThe [[medical droid]] [[AZI-345211896246498721347|AZI-3]] suggested a phase 5 atomic scan be performed on Tup, in order to find the source of his breakdown. Se claimed that the scan could kill him, and instead suggested that they terminate the clone and do an autopsy on his body, as she believed that the cause of his behavior was a virus. Ti instead believed that the cause was mental, suggesting that the Separatists had brainwashed him during his time at Ringo Vinda. Each decided to speak with their respective peers on what they should do next. While Se conversed with Lama Su, Ti contacted the Jedi Council on [[Coruscant]] to discuss the issue. Ti told them of the situation and backed up her theory of brainwashing with the fact that Tup had gone missing for five rotations while on Ringo Vinda prior to murdering Master Tiplar. The Council told her to bring the clone back to the Jedi Temple, where they would examine him through [[the Force]].<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" />\n\n[[File:Informing_Palpatine_of_Tups_death.png|thumb|250px|Shaak Ti informs Chancellor Palpatine of the death of clone trooper CT-5385.]]\nTi was then alerted to an invader alarm on Kamino which she found had been triggered by Fives, who, along with AZI-3, had run the atomic scan against orders. They had located and extracted a [[tumor]] which they believed to be the cause of Tup's behavior. Tup soon died muttering that he was \"free of the nightmares.\" Ti and Se contacted [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] and told him about the situation. Ti requested that she be able to continue testing on the tumor at the Jedi Temple, but the Chancellor told her to bring the data to the [[Grand Republic Medical Facility]] on Coruscant. Se agreed with Palpatine's suggestion, and the outnumbered Ti informed the Chancellor that she would do as he asked.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" /> Later on, Ti and Se met with Fives in his examination room. Ti told Fives about the Chancellor's orders and explained that the investigation was better left to medical professionals, inquisitively adding that there was much they didn't know about the tumor yet before placing it in a case. Se stated her opinion that Fives' actions kept them from learning more about the tumor, which irked the clone. The two began arguing over the situation before Ti stopped them. With their arguing settled, Ti told the two that she had arranged for the tumor and all the data gathered to be sent to the Jedi Temple. The outraged Se tried to dissuade the Jedi Master, but Ti simply told Se that her word was final. Ti told Fives that he had one last physical to pass before he would be returned to duty.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\n[[File:FivesOnTheLam-Fugitive.png|left|thumb|202x202px|With a blaster pointed at her head, Nala Se tries to convince Ti that the inhibitor chips are harmless]]\nBefore she could leave for Coruscant, however, Ti was alerted that Fives and AZI-3 were attempting to escape. Ti and Se led a squad of clones to a hangar, where they chased after the fleeing duo. The group couldn't reach Fives and AZI-3 in time, and they watched from the hangar as the two fugitives left in an [[Kaminoan flight pod|escape pod]]. Ti ordered that the pod be tracked so they could bring them in alive. Unbeknownst to Ti, Fives and AZI-3 had not planned to escape, but to create a diversion so they could investigate Tup's death and the origin of the tumor in secret. In the central control room, Ti and Se continued their search. Ti told Se that she had a feeling that they were searching in the wrong place. She was soon informed that there had been strange activity in the Genetic Records Hall and that someone was accessing the Jango Fett [[Clone template|template data]]. Ti ordered that the room be evacuated quietly, and immediately left with a group of clones and Se to investigate. Ti's suspicions turned out to be true and they found Fives and AZI-3 in the Records Hall. Ti, Se, and the clones gave chase once again, but the two renegades escaped into the emergency flooding system. Back in the control center, Ti correctly surmised that Fives and AZI-3 weren't planning to escape, but rather that they were researching something, she just didn't know what. She later saw Se quietly leaving the command center and followed her with a squad of clone troopers. She arrived at the Embryo Room in time to see Fives holding a [[blaster]] to Se's head, and told him to surrender as she ignited her lightsaber.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\n[[File:ShaakTiEvidence-Fugitive.png|thumb|250px|Fives and AZI-3 show Ti the inhibitor chip, which they claim is the center to a large conspiracy]]\nFives told her how he, assisted by AZI-3, discovered that the tumor had been bio-engineered and suspected a larger plot to be the cause of Tup's actions. The duo had also discovered that all troopers, including Fives, had been implanted with the same organic [[inhibitor chip]], which had malfunctioned in Tup. Ti asked for an explanation of why Tup's had degraded, but Fives told her that it didn't matter and that the entire Republic army could be compromised unless the chips were removed. Se claimed that the chips had been placed to inhibit aggressive behavior and that Tup's malfunction was an isolated incident, as well as that removing the chip caused Tup to die. When he told them that he had removed his own chip, Se claimed that Fives was a threat and should be terminated. Fives was angered by the suggestion and told Se that she had no right to treat him like hardware, to which Se stated that the clones were merely the property of the Kaminoans. At this remark, Ti interjected on Fives' behalf, saying that the clones were technically the property of the Republic and invoking Jedi authority once more to insist that Fives be sent to the Chancellor for investigation, rather than let him be terminated by the doctor. Se countered that he was not part of the Chancellor's initial request, but Ti remained sturdy in sending him to Coruscant. Fives thanked her for believing in him, to which Ti replied that she was only doing what was right.<ref name=\"Fugitive\" />\n\n[[File:ShaakTiChasesFives-TCWS06E04.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|Ti chases after Fives in the Grand Republic Medical Facility]]\nTi led Fives, as well as Se, to the Grand Republic Medical Facility on Coruscant. As they approached Coruscant, however, Se drugged Fives behind Ti's back, making the clone paranoid and aggressive. Upon arrival, they were greeted by Mas Amedda, who led them inside to the Chancellor. The Chancellor greeted Ti as Fives was put on an examination table. Ti gave the chips to the Chancellor and Se explained what they were. He asked whether or not a virus was the sure cause of the decay in Tup's chip, to which Se said that they only knew that the chip had failed and that Fives was now a threat after removing his own. Fives insisted to the Chancellor that the Kaminoans were covering something up about the chips and that if not, he and Tup were victims of a Separatist plot. Se again argued that a virus was responsible and that Fives should be terminated. The Chancellor requested that Ti and Se wait outside while he talked with Fives. Ti protested, but the Chancellor assured her that he and Fives would be safe. As she was meditating outside, Ti heard blaster fire and opened the door to see Fives disarming the Chancellor and his security. Fives began to aim his weapon at the Chancellor, but Ti used the Force to stop him. The Chancellor claimed that Fives had tried to assassinate him. While Ti was helping the Chancellor up, Fives ran out of the room and down a staircase. She chased after the fleeing clone and jumped down the staircase to the medical bay. She ordered that the [[blast door]]s be closed, but Fives managed to make it through in time.<ref name=\"Orders\">{{TCW|Orders}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EpGuide604.png|thumb|right|220px|Shaak Ti discusses the assassination attempt with the Jedi.]]\nTi met with Masters [[Plo Koon]], Yoda, Windu, and Skywalker and told them about Fives' actions. Skywalker, whose [[501st Legion|legion]] Fives belonged to, expressed disbelief upon hearing that he had tried to assassinate the Chancellor. Ti told them that the Kaminoans believed that a virus had caused the clones' inhibitor chip to malfunction, resulting in this behavior, while Fives believed that he was the victim of a conspiracy. Windu informed the Jedi that the Chancellor had been moved to his senate quarters and that all security and clone forces on Coruscant were ordered to join the manhunt for Fives. He added that the Jedi were not asked to take part in the search, something those present found odd. Windu suggested that they lead an undercover investigation to find if any plot involving the clones existed, which Skywalker volunteered to do. Ti warned him to be cautious, as the removal of the chip might have changed Fives. Shortly after being found by Skywalker and Rex, the unstable and neurotic Fives was killed by Commander [[CC-1010|Fox]] as he attempted to reveal what he had learned about the chips' true purpose.<ref name=\"Orders\" />\n\nTi, along with Skywalker, Windu, and Yoda, met with the Chancellor later, where he gave his own explanation of the clones' breakdown. Palpatine told the Jedi that his investigation had led him to believe that a [[parasite]] native to Ringo Vinda had caused the chips to malfunction, and that an inoculation for it had been developed which would be administered to the clones. Ti and Skywalker remained silent during the meeting, listening as Yoda and Windu accepted the words of the Chancellor, who ensured that nothing more would be made of the situation and that their attention be redirected to the war.<ref name=\"Orders\" />\n\nSoon after, Palpatine informed the Jedi Council of [[Queen]] [[Julia]] of [[Bardotta]]'s request for [[Jar Jar Binks]] to assist her after the disappearance of several [[Dagoyan Masters]].

After confirming the ship as Sifo-Dyas', the Council chose to investigate the matter deeper. Ti was present when Skywalker and Kenobi gave a report of their [[Mission to Oba Diah (Clone Wars)|mission to Oba Diah]], where they were confronted by Dooku. They had learned the startling realization that Dooku and Tyranus, the man who helped Sifo-Dyas order the clone army, were one and the same. Dooku had, under the name Tyranus, enlisted Jango Fett to be the template for the clone army Sifo-Dyas had ordered and paid the [[Pyke Syndicate|Pykes]] on Oba Diah to kill Sifo-Dyas by shooting down his ship. Ti and the Council chose to keep this revelation secret, knowing that belief in the war effort would disintegrate if the public knew that the [[Sith]] had a secret connection to the army and that they had no reason to doubt the clones' loyalty at the time. Yoda lamented that the Council would have to play along with the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]]'s games until they could unravel their web and learn their intentions.<ref name=\"The Lost One\">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EpGuide611.png|thumb|right|220x220px|Ti and the Council express concern for Yoda's health]]\nShortly after the Council's investigation of Sifo-Dyas' death, Yoda began hearing the voice of long-dead Jedi [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] during meditation. Ti and the Council met to discuss the revelations surrounding Dooku, specifically the idea that Dooku was not the Sith Lord they had been searching for and merely an apprentice. When asked his opinion during the meeting, Yoda told them that he was deep in thought and had not been listening. The Council was confused by the Grand Master's strange behavior, and Ti looked to [[Oppo Rancisis]] and Kit Fisto with concern. Sometime later Yoda called a meeting to tell the Council what had been troubling him and requested that they join him in meditating to see if they could hear the voice as well. Ti joined the rest of the Council in meditation at the center of the room, where she placed her hand on [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]] and knelt. Despite remaining in a state of meditation for the duration of an entire day, their efforts proved fruitless as not one of the Jedi present heard the voice. As Fisto helped Ti up, Yoda walked away from the other Jedi in disillusionment. Mundi proposed that Yoda had been deceived by the Sith, which Kenobi argued against despite Yoda's agreement. Yoda later heard Jinn's voice again and was told to travel to [[Dagobah]] to find the answers he sought. While on Dagobah, he experienced a harrowing [[Force vision|vision]] in which Ti was impaled by Anakin Skywalker's [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]] while meditating.<ref name=\"Voices\">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vision_of_a_peaceful_Jedi_Order.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Ti and several Jedi appeared throughout Yoda's visions]]\nTi, alongside many Jedi both dead and alive, later appeared in another of Yoda's visions as he walked through the [[Valley of Extinction]] in the mysterious [[Wellspring of Life]]. Ti was seen conversing with Barriss Offee and [[Adi Gallia]]. The former was imprisoned on Coruscant and the latter was killed during a [[skirmish on Florrum]]. All Jedi present gathered underneath the [[Great Tree (Coruscant)|Great Tree]], where Yoda realized that these events were an illusion, calling out Jinn and Gallia as being deceased, and Dooku as being a traitor.

Ti was present during Kenobi's report of the situation, listening as Yoda ordered him to keep the crystal out of Separatist hands. The subsequent [[Mission to Utapau|mission]] led to the crystal's destruction by the Jedi. Ti sat among her fellow masters when Skywalker and Kenobi reported their actions to the council. The Jedi learned from Yoda that kyber crystals like the one on Utapau had once powered ancient [[superweapon]]s constructed by the Sith and that the mysterious Dark Lord of the Sith might one day discover another giant kyber crystal and craft a [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|new superweapon]].<ref name=\"The Big Bang\">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref>\n\n====Plot to assassinate Dooku====\n{{Quote|I agree, but Vos doesn't have to be in the field.''\"<br />\"''But if he is there, he will be able to react immediately with any knowledge he has that we don't.

Ti remained silent during the meeting, her expression calm but sorrowful. After careful consideration, the Council chose to send [[Quinlan Vos]]. Vos, alongside Dooku's former assassin, Ventress, trained to take down Dooku. The plan failed, as Vos was [[Mission to Raxus Secundus|captured]] and Ventress narrowly escaped.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing a failed [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|attempt]] to free Vos and the revelation that he was Dooku's new [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]], Ventress met with Kenobi and was brought to the Temple. Ti was in a meeting with Yoda, Windu, Koon, and Ki-Adi-Mundi when Kenobi and Ventress entered. All except Yoda raised [[Shaak Ti's lightsaber|their]] [[lightsaber]]s in response to Ventress' appearance. With reassurance from Kenobi, the Jedi lowered their defenses. With the Jedi's help, [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|Vos was freed]]. The Council learned that he had, according to his own recollection, not fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] and was merely imprisoned by Dooku. The Council met soon after to discuss what to do with him, as Ventress refused to believe that he was no longer free of the dark side and the Council was divided on how he should have been handled. Windu wanted to keep him away from the war effort, as Vos posed a threat to the Republic, due to his knowledge of both Republic and Separatist information and his ties with Dooku. Both Kenobi and Ti spoke against this, saying that his knowledge would aid the Republic, and they should give him smaller assignments until he was deemed ready to rejoin the war at hand. Over the next several [[Standard month|months]], Vos led several smaller missions to small Separatist [[Destruction of the Separatist supply storage base|storage facilities]] and [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|listening posts]], each of which ended with growing suspicion as to Vos' loyalty, as every outpost seemed to have been abandoned by the Separatists before the Republic forces arrived. To test his loyalty, the Council sent him to assassinate Dooku once more. He recruited Ventress again, and they [[Second battle of Christophsis|traveled]] to [[Christophsis]]. Ventress was proven right in her belief that he was still under the influence of the dark side, but sacrificed herself at the hands of Dooku in order to redeem him.

The Council, upon learning of this, made his capture their highest priority in order to end the war. Palpatine, who the Council already strongly distrusted, took it upon himself to appoint Skywalker to the Council. With little option, the Council agreed but refused to grant him the rank of [[Master]], infuriating the young Jedi. The Council had only agreed in order to spy on the Chancellor through Skywalker. Ti was not present during these events but did attend the meeting where Skywalker informed the Council that Republic Intelligence had located Grievous on Utapau. Skywalker volunteered to lead the mission but was [[Battle of Utapau|replaced]] by Kenobi at Windu and Mundi's urging.

Sidious was the mastermind behind the creation of both the clone and droid armies, as well as Dooku's Sith mentor. After Sidious revealed to Skywalker his true identity, Windu [[Duel in Palpatine's office|gathered]] together Fisto, Tiin, and [[Agen Kolar]] to arrest the Supreme Chancellor for his crimes. Sidious killed Windu's team in quick succession, with Windu falling shortly thereafter courtesy of Skywalker's betrayal. With the promise of saving those he loved from dying, Sidious turned Skywalker to the dark side of the Force.
