He continually opposed [[Esselian Hall]] [[President/Legends|President]] [[Cambira Ralle]].\n\n==Biography==\nOn 36:2:8 [[Great ReSynchronization|GrS]], Freller held a press conference in [[Alabar]] asking Ralle to voluntarily retire. The conference was covered by [[Deena Mipps]], reporter for [[Darpa SectorNet]].<ref name=\"GNN5\" />\n\nAs the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] suffered a recession during the [[rawmat shortage of 1&ndash;2 ABY]], Freller capitalized on Esseles' flagging economy. In statements such as those he made in an interview with [[Damatal Holonews]], he targeted Ralle's policy of allowing [[Alien/Legends|non-Humans]] to be employed in strategic manufacturing jobs on the world. This attack made substantial inroads against the Forad Party's coalition government with the [[Cardean Party]], as well as against Forad itself.<ref name=\"GNN8\">{{Journal|8|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Esselian Hall election, 2 ABY|Esselian Hall election]] held during the New Year [[Fete Week]] of [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], Forad lost its holding of the majority of the Esselian Hall for the first time in two decades, with Freller's party making significant gains. Freller jubilantly celebrated the gains at a gathering held at the [[Nurumbal Shrine]], and later called for a new Presidential election.<ref name=\"GNN8\" />\n\nWithin a month, terrorist attacks by the anti-Imperial group known as [[the Faceless]] at [[Grande Hyet]] and [[Tralee]] had further stirred up the political situation on Esseles, leading to a strike by the the [[Guild of Offworlder Skilled Laborers]] and an exodus of aliens from the world. Following the Faceless attacks, Freller made a statement outwardly supporting President Ralle, though it also cast doubt on Ralle's motivations so close to the Presidential election.<ref name=\"GNN9\">{{Journal|9|Galaxywide NewsNets}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{Journal|5|Galaxywide NewsNets}} {{1st}}\n*{{Journal|8|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n*{{Journal|9|Galaxywide NewsNets}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|es=Jamson Freller\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freller, Jamson}}\n[[Category:Esselians]]\n[[Category:Government figures]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
