The Lost One's [[gartro rookery]] hazing ritual&mdash;devised by Bibo&mdash;was infamous in the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscanti]] underworld for its unnecessary cruelty.\n\nHowever, even monsters could have a change of heart, and in Bibo's case his was stolen by [[Sleta Suke]], the young daughter of the Ortolan ambassador to Coruscant. Conspiring with her to steal her away from her planned engagement, he had the catering for the engagement party poisoned with [[knockout drops]] and fled with her into the undercity while the partygoers were incapacitated.\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]'' {{1stm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bibo, Trunks}}\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Ortolans]]"}}}]}}}}
