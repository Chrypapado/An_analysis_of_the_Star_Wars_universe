The Jinzler parents worked at the Temple itself, as maintenance engineers on the electrical equipment. They adored and honored the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], and took each of their children in to be tested for potential [[The Force/Legends|Force]] sensitivity. The third Jinzler child, [[Lorana Jinzler|Lorana]], was accepted for Jedi training at the age of 10 months. The fourth child, [[Dean Jinzler|Dean]], was a gifted engineer, and would later visit the site of his sister's death.\n\n==Family tree==\n                               Jinzler Parents\n                                      |\n            +------------+------------+------------------+\n            |            |            |                  |\n         Unknown        Unknown   [[Lorana Jinzler]]    [[Dean Jinzler]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Outbound Flight (novel)|''Outbound Flight'']]\n*[[Outbound Flight (audiobook)|''Outbound Flight'' audiobook]]\n*''[[Survivor's Quest]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Familie Jinzler\n|ja=\u30b8\u30f3\u30ba\u30e9\u30fc\u5bb6\n|pl=Jinzler\n}}\n\n[[Category:Coruscanti]]\n[[Category:Families]]"}}}]}}}}
