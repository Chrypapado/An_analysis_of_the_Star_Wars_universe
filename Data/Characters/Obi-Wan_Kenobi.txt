As a [[Jedi General]], Kenobi served in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] that fought against the [[Separatist Droid Army]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. Kenobi, however, was forced into [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] as a result of the [[Great Jedi Purge]]. As a mentor, Kenobi was responsible for [[Jedi training|training]] two members of the [[Skywalker family]], [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Luke Skywalker]], both of whom served in turn as his [[Padawan]] in the ways of [[the Force]].\n\nKenobi was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Stewjon]] in [[57 BBY]]. He was [[Force-sensitive]], and therefore [[Jedi Initiate|inducted]] into the [[Jedi Order]] as a [[Youngling|child]]. Raised in the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]], Kenobi was assigned to [[Jedi]] Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]. In [[32 BBY]], Kenobi attained the rank of [[Jedi Knight]] by [[Battle of Naboo|defeating]] the [[Sith Lord]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo]]. He also chose to train Anakin Skywalker&mdash;the prophesied [[Chosen One]] who was destined to destroy the [[Sith]] and restore balance to the Force&mdash;having promised Jinn who [[Death|died]] in the [[lightsaber duel]] against Maul.\n\nWith the [[First Battle of Geonosis|advent]] of the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars in [[22 BBY]], Kenobi adopted the [[military rank]] of [[general]] in the Grand [[Army]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. Kenobi led the [[clone trooper]]s of the [[212th Attack Battalion]] alongside [[Clone Marshal Commander]] [[CC-2224]] throughout [[the galaxy]]-wide conflict, achieving multiple victories over the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. In [[19 BBY]], Kenobi killed General [[Grievous]] during the [[Battle of Utapau]], effectively ending the Clone Wars. He survived the [[Order 66|purge]] of the Jedi Order, which resulted from the [[Grand Plan|machinations]] of the Sith [[Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]]. After discovering that Skywalker had turned to the [[dark side of the Force]], becoming Sidious' [[Sith apprentice]] under the name of [[Darth]] Vader, Kenobi [[Duel on Mustafar|defeated]] his former Padawan on [[Mustafar]] and exiled himself to the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet [[Tatooine]] as the [[Galactic Empire]] [[Imperial Era|rose to power]].\n\nAdopting a [[hermit]] lifestyle as \"Ben Kenobi,\" he watched over Vader's son, [[Luke Skywalker]], whose Jedi training Kenobi began in [[0 BBY]]. In the same year, Kenobi [[Rescue of Princess Leia|encountered]] Vader aboard the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|first]] [[Death Star]], where he sacrificed himself to ensure that Luke and his allies escaped from the Sith Lord. In death, Kenobi became [[Immortality|one with the Force]] which allowed him to continue guiding Luke throughout the [[Galactic Civil War]]. In [[4 ABY]], Kenobi reunited with his former student, Anakin Skywalker, who died [[Battle of Endor|destroying]] his [[Sith Master]] in order to save his son. Kenobi was remembered as a legendary Jedi Master during the [[New Republic Era|rise]] of the [[New Republic]]; [[Ben Solo]], the son of Luke's [[twin]] sister, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], was named after Kenobi. Solo's [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|turn to the dark side]] left Luke disillusioned with the Jedi Order's legacy, and he held Kenobi responsible for Anakin's transformation into Vader.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n====Training begins====\n{{Quote|Well, I can't say I really remember.

During that time, they had an incident with a swarm of [[venom-mite]]s on [[Draboon]], where Kenobi carried Kryze to safety, only to fall and drop the Duchess, who then acquired a scar. Obi-Wan fell in love with Satine during his stay on Mandalore, but despite his feelings toward her, he continued with his training and was reassigned.

They were thought to be making increasingly violent attacks nearing the treaty's signing, compared to their past actions. [[Rael Averross]] requested the assistance of Kenobi and his Master Qui-Gon Jinn to bring an end to the dispute. Kenobi and his Master discovered that Crown Princess [[Fanry]] had been building a military group called the [[blackguard]]s, who were framing the Opposition in order to restore the full monarchy.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\n====Saving Th'er====\n{{Quote|Where are we heading, Master?|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Qui-Gon Jinn when escaping from the Metal Clan|Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn 1}}\n[[File:Obi-Wan_Mission_to_Brin.png|thumb|right|197x197px|Obi-Wan during the rescue of priestess Th'er.]]\nThe [[Jedi Order]] sent Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to the planet [[Bri'n]] to resolve a [[Conflict on Bri'n|conflict]].

The two received a message from the surface of the planet from Jedi Master Yoda, who was asking for assistance. Landing on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi discovered that Yoda had taken out the entire pirate gang in order to rescue a young Force-sensitive child, known as [[Lo]], as the pirate had planned to sell him due to his abilities in the Force.<ref name=\"Star Wars 26\">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref>\n\n===Invasion of Naboo===\n{{Quote|I have a bad feeling about this.''\"<br />\"''I don't sense anything.''\"<br />\"''It's not about the mission, Master.

However, negotiations did not take place as [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] instead sent [[B1-series battle droid|B1 battle droids]] and [[droideka]]s to kill the two Jedi, but they [[Escape from the Saak'ak|escaped]] to Naboo's surface by stowing away on separate landing craft.\n\nOn Naboo, Kenobi found Jinn in the company of [[Gungan]] [[Jar Jar Binks]], who reluctantly led the two Jedi to [[Otoh Gunga]], where they met with the Gungan leader [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass|Nass]]. Though unable to convince the Gungans to help the humans of Naboo, Jinn [[Mind trick|influenced]] Nass to give them [[Gungan bongo submarine|transport]] to allow them to reach [[Theed]]. Piloting the transport through the planet's core, Kenobi, Jinn, and Binks reached Theed only to discover that the Trade Federation had already taken control of the city. After rescuing [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala|Amidala]] and several others, the Jedi took Amidala off of Naboo in her [[Naboo Royal Starship|starship]] in an attempt to reach Coruscant with news of the invasion. During the escape, the [[Starship|ship's]] [[hyperdrive]] was damaged, which prevented them from going straight to Coruscant and forced them to land on [[Tatooine]] for repairs.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:NiceToMeetYouFutureMassMurderer-TPM.png|thumb|211x211px|right|Kenobi meets Anakin Skywalker.]]\nAfter landing, Kenobi stayed behind on the ship, while Jinn, Amidala (disguised as a [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden]]), Binks and [[R2-D2]] went to look for a new hyperdrive unit. While looking for it, Jinn discovered [[Anakin Skywalker]], from whom he retrieved a blood sample and had the data sent to Kenobi on the ship. The Padawan, then, found that the boy's [[midi-chlorian]] count was the highest of any Jedi. When Jinn arrived, accompanied by Skywalker, [[Darth]] [[Maul]]'s attack prompted them to escape to Coruscant at once.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nUpon their arrival on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi went directly to the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] to report on the mysterious attacker, whom Jinn believed to be a [[Sith Lord]]. After being briefed on what to do about their mysterious attacker, Jinn discussed about Skywalker with the Council, believing him to be the [[Chosen One]]. Nevertheless, the Council was determined that the boy not be trained. However, Jinn persevered, telling them that he would take the boy as his Padawan, despite the Jedi Code's restrictions, but Kenobi insisted he was ready to take the trials, and his master agreed. Instead of discussing the matter further, [[Mace Windu]] sent the pair back to Naboo to protect the Queen and also as an attempt to lure out the mysterious assailant.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Kenobi_Maul_clash.png|thumb|262x262px|left|Obi-Wan Kenobi fighting Darth Maul after his Master was impaled.]]\nAfter returning to Naboo, Binks located the Gungans and Amidala, revealing herself to be the true Queen, begged Boss Nass to provide assistance in fighting the droid armies of the Trade Federation. Boss Nass agreed to [[Battle of Naboo|fight]] the droids as a diversion, while the Queen's forces slipped into Theed and captured Gunray. However, they soon encountered Maul once again and engaged in a duel with him, biding time for Amidala and her forces to reach the throne room. During the duel with Maul, Kenobi was separated from his master and forced to watch as Maul impaled Jinn with [[Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber|his]] [[double-bladed lightsaber]] so, when the opportunity arose, Kenobi retaliated in rage against the Sith. However, the [[Dathomirian]] [[Zabrak]] gained the upper hand, knocking Kenobi into a nearby shaft where he was just barely able to grab onto a knob jutting out from the side before falling to his death. Maul used this opportunity to kick [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's first lightsaber|his]] lightsaber into the shaft. Despite his predicament, Kenobi was able to use his master's [[Qui-Gon Jinn's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to cut the Sith in half, whose body fell down the shaft, presumably [[Death|dead]].

Kenobi decided to take Skywalker with him as part of his training. Kenobi went to the [[Jedi Archives|Temple Archives]] to find information on Dallenor and about any Jedi that went there, to no avail. He told Master Yoda that he would take his apprentice with him, to which Yoda surprisingly agreed.

Kenobi was told of Clatriffe's discovery of centuries-old droids and how she had to hire several of the locals for protection. Kenobi examined the Holocron, but did not open it due to the arrival of [[Hudso Shaku]] and his [[Krypder Riders]]. Kenobi attempted to convince them to leave, but Shaku and the riders wanted the artifacts and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's second lightsaber|Kenobi's lightsaber]]. Kenobi fought the riders and subdued them. Kenobi then saw that Shaku had taken Skywalker hostage and demanded his lightsaber.

They began their journey to the coordinates, but their shuttle was damaged due to the planet's [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] debris field and the two had to eject from the doomed vessel, landing below the [[Celadon Sea]]. Not too long afterwards, they came to be aware of there being life on the planet as a sky battle raged over them, and Kenobi returned his lightsaber to him so that he could defend himself. As one of the combatant airships began to fall, Skywalker and Kenobi saved its two-person crew by delaying the crash.<ref name=\"OW&A 1\" />\n\nThe survivors, [[Kolara]] and Mother [[Pran]], were unaware of the distress signal and who the Jedi were.<ref name=\"OW&A 1\" /> Kenobi was then able to use a mind trick on Pran to lower her weapons. However, they came under attack by the other airship. Kenobi then used his lightsaber to destroy the airship. Kenobi then stopped the pilot, [[Grecker]] from shooting at Skywalker, Pran, and Kolara. After Skywalker destroyed their blasters, Kenobi then pulled their knives away. Kenobi reasoned with Grecker, Kolara, and Pran that they need to get to safety. As they made their way, they came across [[Corpse-leech]]es. Kenobi and Skywalker then drew their lightsabers and tried to use the force to connect with them to no avail. Kenobi and the others then boarded an airship.<ref name=\"OW&A 2\" />\n\n[[File:Corpse-leeches.png|thumb|left|227x227px|War on the planet Carnelion IV.]]\nKenobi then refused to accept to give them the location of the distress signal. He also told Grecker that Skywalker was not his son, but his Padawan at the dying request of his master. Kenobi and Grecker then defended the airship against the corpse-leeches. However, Pran and Kolara took Skywalker with them and abandoned the airship. Kenobi was then left behind on the airship as Pran destroyed it.<ref name=\"OW&A 3\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 3|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 3]]</ref>\n\nKenobi and Grecker were then able to jump off the airship before it crashed. Kenobi was then able to use the force to make the creatures understand him. Kenobi then asked Grecker to tell him where Skywalker was taken to. Grecker told him that he did not know where the open was. Kenobi then decided to go after him with Grecker after getting air masks on. Kenobi and Grecker then found the location of the distress signal. They then came under attack by a creature. Grecker then fired a flare. Kenobi and Grecker then fought until a masked man came out and let them in. Kenobi was able to get inside before Grecker closed the door. The man, [[Sera]], then showed Kenobi his collection of his world's remnants. Kenobi was then told that Sera was the one who sent the distress signal. He then told Kenobi about his collection of relics and how both the open and closed wanted him dead.<ref name=\"OW&A 4\" />\n\nKenobi then learned about how Sera sent the signal and learned about both the Jedi and Sith. Kenobi and Sera then went to the roof to watch as Grecker's forces attacked his fortress. Despite Sera's pleas for Kenobi to kill them, Kenobi told her that the Jedi spare everyone. Kenobi then spoke with Grecker and convinced him to stop their attack. However, Mother Pran attacked with her machines. Kenobi was then saved by Skywalker. Kenobi then took Skywalker to the Sera's communication unit. There, Skywalker was able to send out a signal off-planet.

A few moments after Kenobi was offered death sticks by a drug dealer, he sensed Wesell's presence and cut her arm off with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's second lightsaber|his]] lightsaber before she could shoot him. Before she could tell the Jedi who she was working for, Wesell was shot and killed by a toxic dart fired by [[Jango Fett]].<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n[[File:Investigate_SWDL.png|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi investigating the Kamino saberdart at Dex's Diner]]\nSubsequently, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent on separate missions by the Council\u2014while Kenobi continued an investigation on Amidala's aggressors, Skywalker would protect her on Naboo. Despite thinking his Padawan was not prepared for his first solo mission, he abided by Council's request. Kenobi, then, took the toxic dart to his friend [[Dexter Jettster]], who told him that it was a [[Kamino saberdart]]. Using Dex's information about [[Kamino]], Kenobi visited the [[Jedi Archives|Archives]], but he was unable to locate the system. When he asked [[Jocasta Nu]] about it, she surmised that the system must not exist since it was not in the archives. Unconvinced, Kenobi visited Master Yoda, who was teaching the [[Bear Clan]], and the two agreed that someone had erased the files on Kamino from the Archives, and that Kenobi needed to visit the location of the lost planet.<ref name=\"Episode II\" />\n\n====Discovery of the Clone Army====\n{{Quote|I have successfully made contact with the Prime Minister of Kamino.

She took Obi-Wan to Prime Minister [[Lama Su]], who said [[Sifo-Dyas]] would have been proud of the army they had created in accordance with his request\u2014to create a [[Grand Army of the Republic|clone army]] for the Republic. Kenobi was then shown the [[Clone trooper|clones']] prowess and growth, and was told that the original template was Jango Fett.

Obi-Wan confronted Jango, and the two fought on the landing platform. At the end of the battle, Obi-Wan fell off the platform, and Jango believed he had fallen into the sea.

It was then that Kenobi met Togruta [[Ahsoka Tano]], who relayed Master Yoda's message to return to Coruscant for a new [[Mission to Jabba's Palace (Clone Wars)|mission]], but the impending Separatist threat made it impossible for them to leave their post. Awaiting reinforcements and under attack, Kenobi allowed Skywalker and Tano to go behind enemy lines to destroy their enemy's [[deflector shield]] generator with him stalling for time by holding a fake surrender negotiation with General [[Whorm Loathsom|Loathsom]].<ref name=\"TCWFilm\">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' (film)]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Obi-Wan_Jabba_negotiations.png|thumb|left|225x225px|Kenobi negotiating with Jabba the Hutt.]]\nWith Skywalker and Tano's timely destruction of the generator, Kenobi captured Loathsom and met up with Yoda, who arrived with reinforcements.

However, Palpatine had already ordered [[Doctor]] [[Sionver Boll]] to kill the beast to extract its scales, and the poison intended to kill it only caused the creature to become agitated and aggressive.

With their primary target being the shield generator at the Ray Shield Fortress the Jedi mounted a three-pronged attack on the Geonosian defenses. Kenobi and Cody commenced the central push while Mundi and Skywalker led the northern and southern assaults, respectively. Though Kenobi was able to reach the landing zone, which was known as [[Point Rain]], the Jedi General was injured and forced to wait for Skywalker and Mundi's arrival who, despite their crashing, managed to fight their way up and join Kenobi. In a combined effort, they managed to destroy the shield generator, and Kenobi and Mundi returned to the fleet with the rest of the wounded for treatment.<ref name=\"Landing at Point Rain\" />\n\nFollowing the Republic's hard-won victory that was cemented after the factory's destruction by Skywalker, Tano, Unduli, and Unduli's Padawan [[Barriss Offee]]<ref>{{TCW|Weapons Factory}}</ref> Kenobi returned to the planet and mounted an intense campaign to find Poggle, with Unduli spearheading the search only to follow Poggle to the [[Progate Temple]], where she was captured by the Archduke and taken to the lair of Geonosian Queen [[Karina the Great]] in the catacombs below. Tracking Unduli's last known location, Kenobi and Skywalker set out with a clone platoon to rescue her, and entered the catacombs only to find themselves before the Queen and her \"undead\" servants.

Early in the battle, Kenobi's [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|light cruiser]], the ''[[Surrogator]]'', was caught in a tractor beam from Grievous's [[Grievous's Recusant-class light destroyer|warship]] and boarded by the cyborg himself. Once Skywalker and Gallia rescued Koth, Grievous dueled Kenobi until understanding that the Jedi Master had the upper hand. As the cyborg retreated to his destroyer, he ordered his ship to destroy Kenobi's\u2014who managed to board Grievous' ship with Cody and two other clones before it was too late thanks to Gallia's help. Afterwards, they reunited with Skywalker on the hangar so that they could escape from Grievous' ship. Meanwhile, Grievous was forced to flee in an [[escape pod]] and landed on the planet.<ref name=\"Grievous Intrigue\" />\n\nWhile his fellow Jedi generals continued the battle in orbit, Kenobi led a force of clone troopers to the planet's surface to hunt down Grievous. The cyborg general evaded and fled from the Republic forces, hoping to reach an escape pod with a functioning transmitter in order to call for an evacuation transport. When Kenobi caught up with and engaged Grievous, the cyborg fled the battle once a shuttle arrived to ferry him away.

There, he met [[Prime Minister]] [[Almec]] and re-encountered his old friend, Kryze, who assured him that she was not behind an [[Attack on a Republic cruiser|attack]] on a Republic cruiser. Angered at the accusations, she claimed the Senate was eager to intervene in the planet's affairs before being corrected by Kenobi, who claimed to be there on the Jedi Order's interest. Assuaged, the Duchess then took Kenobi for a walk on [[Peace Park]] and informed him of a renegade group of warriors known as [[Death Watch]] when a terrorist [[Bombing of the Memorial Shrine|blew up]] the [[Memorial Shrine]] where Kryze and Kenobi were walking. When Kenobi had the guards round up everyone at the scene, [[Death Watch bomber|a man]] fled with Kenobi after him and committed suicide instead of being captured. As the Duchess spoke to the dying man, she realized he came from [[Concordia]] and helped Kenobi reach the moon, where the Jedi Master met its [[Governor]], [[Pre Vizsla]].<ref name=\"The Mandalore Plot\">{{TCW|The Mandalore Plot}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kenobi_vs_Vizsla.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi engaging Pre Vizsla in a duel.]]\nKenobi went out to investigate the [[Concordian mines|mines]] and discovered that the Death Watch was using one of the facilities as a base. Taken hostage by the Death Watch, he contacted Kryze, who freed him, and together, they tried to escape when they were attacked and the Commander of the Death Watch arrived. Revealing himself to be Vizsla, he returned Kenobi's lightsaber and dueled him with the [[Darksaber]], until he ordered his warrior to kill him with missiles. Kenobi and Kryze managed to escape, barely surviving, and returned to Mandalore. The next day, Kenobi told the Duchess that he believed the Separatists were involved, which only angered her; the Jedi Master, then, was joined by Skywalker so as to bodyguard her during her and other senators' trip to Coruscant onboard the ''[[Coronet]]''.<ref name=\"The Mandalore Plot\" />\n\nOn their way to the Republic's capital, Kenobi took part of a heated debate with the Duchess over what the best course of action was to deal with the conflict until they took a small break. Then, Skywalker asked him Kenobi of their past, which Kenobi explained he and his master, Jinn, had been protecting her during a year-long, dangerous mission during a civil war on Mandalore. It was then that [[assassin droid]]s were activated, prompting Kenobi to defend Kryze. When the droids were stopped, Skywalker reported to Kenobi that one of the senators was a traitor, and Kenobi then devised a plan to uncover the traitor's identity by using the last active droid.<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\" />\n\n[[File:Obi-Wan_Satine_VoT.png|thumb|right|210px|Kryze safely arriving on Coruscant thanks to Kenobi's help.]]\nIt turned out to be [[Tal Merrik]], who took Kryze as a hostage and made his way to the cockpit to jump out of hyperspace, so that droid reinforcements could enter the ship. While Skywalker engaged the droids, Kenobi found and followed Merrik, who would blow up the ship, as he got near the escape pods, unable to make a move on the senator. Afraid she might not see Kenobi again, Kryze confessed her feelings for him, to which Kenobi replied he would have left the Order if she had told him earlier. Then, Kryze took the opportunity to escape a disgusted Merrik and take his blaster. However, neither Kenobi nor Kryze made a move to stop him, leaving Skywalker to sneak up from behind and stab him in the back, branding himself as a \"cold-blooded killer.\" After arriving on Coruscant, Kenobi and Kryze reflected upon the situation, and the Duchess flirted with him, saying his beard hid too much of his \"handsome face.\"<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\" />\n\nWhen Kryze's pleas to the Senate to not interfere with Mandalore's internal affairs went unheard, Kenobi reunited with the Duchess, advising her not to be rash, angering her. Soon enough, she fell victim to another terrorist attack and barely survived, prompting the Senate to accelerate the vote&mdash;with the Republic deciding to occupy Mandalore. Despite Kenobi's plea to help her, Kryze took matters in her own hands, only to framed with murder by the Death Watch.<ref name=\"Duchess of Mandalore\">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SKASOWKPAPMA-DoM.png|thumb|left|210px|Chancellor Palpatine apologizing to Duchess Satine Kryze.]]\nAsking for his help, Kenobi met her and accepted to give Senator Amidala the disc she had obtained from his contact. Despite an attack by a Death Watch assassin and Kryze turning herself in, Kenobi got the disc through to Amidala, who then played the complete recording from Deputy Prime Minister [[Jerec]] in front of the Senate\u2014prompting the Senate to vote against Mandalore's occupation. When the Duchess received the apologies and thanks from the Chancellor and [[Mas Amedda]], Kenobi received her thanks, though the two reflected about not knowing who tried to drag Mandalore into war and have the Duchess framed for murder.<ref name=\"Duchess of Mandalore\" />\n\n====Kamino under attack====\n{{Quote|All too easy.''\"<br />\"''Define 'easy,' General.|Grievous and Kenobi|ARC Troopers}}\n[[File:KnowledgeAndDefense-CWCS.png|thumb|right|250px|Kenobi leading clone troops in defense of Tipoca City]]\nAfter the destruction of the Rishi Moon tracking station, Kenobi and Skywalker intercepted a coded message between Ventress and Grievous.

As Skywalker fought in the space above Kamino, Kenobi took a submarine and discovered Ventress's forces readying their assault crafts under water. [[AQ-series battle droid]]s attacked his submarine, but he escaped thanks to a passing [[aiwha]]. The Jedi General managed to get back and recalled Skywalker to the city as the Separatists commanders Grievous and Ventress attacked; while Kenobi faced off against Grievous, Skywalker engaged Ventress in combat. The two generals dueled until an assault craft destroyed the platform they were dueling on. Grievous thought he had defeated Kenobi, but an aiwha saved the Jedi again.

Though the Hutt Council denied involvement in this, Vos was able to psychometrically scan a cup, telling him and Kenobi that Ziro had been there. When they got to the prison level, however, Ziro had already escaped due to help from his lover, [[Sy Snootles]]. Kenobi and Vos then tracked Ziro down in the swamp, where they saw Bane following Ziro as well, and found [[Mama|Ziro's mother]] who told them that his son had gone to Teth, where he would secretly recover the [[Hutt Council records]].<ref name=\"Hunt for Ziro\">{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}}</ref>\n\nKenobi and Vos then proceeded to Teth, where they found Ziro shot and dead at his [[Papa|father's]] grave, and were then confronted by Bane.

Though they both made to the rendezvous point, neither Rex nor the Jedi's ship could see each other. In fact, the Jedi's ship was guided to a [[Mortis|mysterious planet]], where they were met by a [[Force wielder|mysterious figure]] called the [[Daughter]] who wanted to lead them to [[Father (Mortis)|The Father]].

As Jinn disappeared, Kenobi woke Tano up and they resolved to find Skywalker together, only for the Daughter and the Son to capture them for Skywalker's test.

Concerned, Kenobi contacted Tano and ordered her to disable the ship, fetch him on the well and meet with Skywalker\u2014whose memories had been erased\u2014and the Father on his Monastery. There, they confronted a newly arrived Son with the Dagger, but only the Father's sacrifice could stop the Son, with Skywalker finally killing the now-vulnerable darksider.

Chained to a wall and tortured for information, Kenobi was recognized as a Jedi by Prime Minister Atai Molec, and prepared to sell him at that night's auction block.<ref name=\"Slaves of the Republic\">{{TCW|Slaves of the Republic}}</ref>\n\nAt the auction, Roshti and Kenobi were the first slaves to be put on offer, and Queen Scintel ordered Skywalker to torture Kenobi with a shock whip before the eyes of the assembled bidders. Once Skywalker entered the arena however, he signaled to R2-D2, who launched Kenobi's, Skywalker's, and Tano's lightsabers to their owners, while Rex aided them with a blaster. Despite their efforts, however, the whole team was soon captured and separated. While Skywalker and Tano were kept in Zygerria, Kenobi, Rex and Roshti were taken to [[Kadavo]], where the rest of the Kiros colonist were kept. There, the Jedi General was forced into submission by the center's warden, [[Agruss]], who emphasized his point by dropping several Togrutan prisoners to their deaths and threatening to do worse to the others, should Kenobi ever think of rebellion.<ref name=\"Slaves of the Republic\" />\n\n[[File:RexTogrutasKadavo.png|thumb|right|220px|Kenobi and Rex during their enslavement on Kadavo.]]\nOn Kadavo, Kenobi and Rex were soon forced into working in the mines, where he had a hard time scrounging up any spark of hope for himself or the unfortunate prisoners, since every time he did so, one of the Togrutans was punished in his place in order to heighten his despair. Following the Queen's death at the hands of Dooku and her last words telling Skywalker where Kenobi was, Kenobi was part of a conference with Count Dooku in the facility control room. Despite Dooku's wish to execute Kenobi, Skywalker arrived to Kadavo with Jedi reinforcements. During the [[Battle of Kadavo|battle]] that ensued, Kenobi and Rex fought in the room, killed Agruss and escaped the facility, while Tano and troopers rescued the Togruta prisoners before the Republic forces destroyed the labor facility.<ref name=\"Escape from Kadavo\">{{TCW|Escape from Kadavo}}</ref>\n\n====Plot to kidnap the Chancellor====\n{{Quote|How do I look?''\"<br />\"''Like a criminal. Should buy you all the credibility you need in prison.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu|Deception}}\nFollowing [[Moralo Eval]]'s capture by the Republic and his imprisonment in the [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center]], Kenobi became part of a plot with Yoda and Mace Windu to stop Eval's machinations to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine. To do so, he allowed himself to be shot by a [[sniper]], [[Rako Hardeen]], in front of Skywalker and Tano, who then believed him to be dead.<ref name=\"Deception\" />\n\n[[File:TheGreatEscape-D.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Kenobi, disguised as Rako Hardeen, escaping with Moralo Eval and Cad Bane.]]\nFollowing his [[Funeral of Obi-Wan Kenobi|funeral]], Kenobi assumed the identity of his apparent killer and had his physical appearance [[Facial transformation program|altered]]. In addition, once Kenobi and Windu recorded a sample of Hardeen's voice in [[Trueping's]], Kenobi swallowed a [[vocal emulator]] to perfectly disguise his voice as Hardeen's. Kenobi would operate under the alias \"Ben\" for the duration of the mission. Kenobi was then sent to the detention center, where he formed a partnership with Eval, who trusted Kenobi and thought he could be useful, and Cad Bane, who did not. When a [[Riot at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|prison riot]] broke out, courtesy of Boba Fett and [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]], Kenobi worked to escape with Bane and Eval. Kenobi discreetly used the Force to aid in their escape, opening a lock after Bane failed to bypass it. Bane was suspicious of Kenobi due to his unwillingness to kill the prison staff, but despite this, they left Coruscant for Nal Hutta.<ref name=\"Deception\" />\n\nWhen they arrived at Nal Hutta, Kenobi crashed their ship in order to cover their trail. The trio then proceeded to try to find supplies and a new ship in the town of [[Bilbousa]]. Bane grew even more distrustful of Kenobi after Kenobi's kind treatment of [[Pablo]], the owner of the [[Pablo's pawnshop|pawnshop]] that the trio went to. Kenobi, suspecting betrayal, planted a tracking device on the new ship he bought, so that when Bane left Kenobi to be arrested by the local authorities, the Jedi turned the frequency of the tracking device over to his captors, who shot Bane and Eval's ship down. Kenobi, meanwhile, escaped from captivity and purchased another ship, and when Bane and Eval found him smugly waiting for them, they agreed to make him a partner in their scheme. When the trio reached [[Orondia]], Skywalker and Tano caught up with them. During a small [[Showdown on Orondia|confrontation]], Kenobi wrestled with Skywalker, whispering \"Anakin, don't follow me,\" just before knocking him unconscious and escaping with Bane and Eval.<ref name=\"Friends and Enemies\">{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Task4Sharpshooting-TB.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Kenobi demonstrates his shooting skills in the fourth task.]]\nEval, Bane, and Kenobi then traveled to [[Serenno]] to meet with Count Dooku, and Bane and Kenobi accepted an invitation to participate along with eleven other notorious bounty hunters in a [[Tournament on Serenno|test of skill]] designed by Eval called the [[Box]]. \"Hardeen\" surpassed Eval's tests, the [[Phindian]] grew angrier with him after every test. In the fourth and final test, their shooting skills would be tested, with the bounty hunter's target being a moving spot on the wall. If they missed, they would fall into a floor of flame emitters. After [[Sixtat]] failed, Kenobi stepped in to shoot the target. However, Eval had laid a trap for Kenobi, as his rifle ran out of shots before he could hit the last moving spot. Eval then removed the platforms in order to kill him, but Bane, now having respect for Kenobi and disgusted by Eval's actions, saved him. Dooku decided that Eval should not be exempted from the contest and dropped him to the now extinguished floor to fight with Kenobi. Though the Count wanted him to kill Eval, Kenobi refrained, disappointing the Sith Lord, who then chose to put Bane in charge of the operation to kidnap the Chancellor.<ref name=\"The Box\">{{TCW|The Box}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dooku_and_his_team_of_BHs.jpg|thumb|left|230px|\"Hardeen\" as part of Dooku's team of bounty hunters.]]\nPlanning to abduct Palpatine during the [[Festival of Light]] on Naboo, the team commandeered a warehouse in Theed and each member of the team was assigned a role, with Kenobi being given the job of the sniper who would fire [[stun]] blasts at the Chancellor. When he was in position, Kenobi contacted Windu to tell him what he knew of the plan. Later that night, despite Skywalker and Windu's efforts during the [[Skirmish in Theed|skirmish]], the Chancellor was kidnapped by Bane and Eval. Kenobi followed them with Windu and Skywalker close behind, and the criminal pair was arrested and the Chancellor recovered when they stopped at the rendezvous point.<ref name=\"Crisis on Naboo\">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>\n\nHowever, he agreed on Skywalker's doubts about knowing the full truth, and returned to the apartment where he had had his position as a sniper, and discovered an activated comlink in his rifle case. Realizing Dooku's hand in it, Kenobi rushed back to the Royal Palace, where he discovered Skywalker dueling with Dooku, while Palpatine was held by a [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuard]]. After Kenobi rescued the Chancellor and Dooku fled, Palpatine thanked the Jedi for their bravery.<ref name=\"Crisis on Naboo\" />\n\n====Maul's return====\n{{Quote|You know, when I cut you in half, I should have aimed for your neck instead.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Maul|Revenge (episode)}}\nLike Master Yoda and Skywalker, Kenobi sensed a [[disturbance in the Force]],<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{TCW|Brothers}}</ref> one that signaled the return of his old enemy, former Sith Lord Maul, whom he believed to have killed on Naboo, only to have survived and make his way to a dump in [[Lotho Minor]]. Rescued by Savage Oppress and his sanity restored by Mother Talzin, Maul sent a message to the Jedi Council and lured Kenobi to [[Raydonia]].<ref name=\"Revenge\">{{TCW|Revenge (episode)|Revenge}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MaulVsKenobi-Revenge.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Kenobi facing a vengeful Maul.]]\nThough the Jedi Master was unsure if Maul was who he claimed to be, the Dathomirian proved it by telling him about their shared experience at the Battle of Naboo. The two engaged in a [[Skirmish above Raydonia|fight]] where Opress helped Maul knock the Jedi Master out. Kenobi was then brought aboard the [[Terrapin-class Bulk Tanker|brothers' ship]], who intended to have the Jedi awake so that his death would be as painful as the last ten years of his life had been. However, Kenobi was rescued by Asajj Ventress, who was trying to collect the bounty on Savage Opress' head. Though he almost gave in to rage, Kenobi gained the upper hand with the help of Ventress and together, they managed to trap Maul and Opress in the back of the ship, leaving the brothers stranded, but alive, in space.<ref name=\"Revenge\" />\n\n====Aiding the Onderon rebels====\n{{Quote|Now, to be clear, we are not here to fight your war; rather, to show you how to conduct it in the most efficient and successful way possible.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|A War on Two Fronts}}\nKenobi attended a session of the Jedi Council when [[Onderon rebels|rebels]] [[Saw Gerrera]] and [[Lux Bonteri]] contacted them with a request for assistance in their [[Onderonian Civil War|struggle]] against the Separatist forces on [[Onderon]], led by King [[Sanjay Rash]]. Kenobi pointed out that at the beginning of the war, Onderon made their intentions to join the Separatists, but Gerrera said that their [[Ramsis Dendup|true king]] was silenced by the fake. The Council refused to help, but did consent to send advisers to train and advise them. Kenobi went there with Skywalker, Tano, and Rex.<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\">{{TCW|A War on Two Fronts}}</ref>\n\nOn Onderon, Kenobi met the rebels and their charismatic leader [[Steela Gerrera]] \u2013 alongside his friends and together, they began to train the rebels in combat. When the Separatists discovered their outpost and attacked, Kenobi and his fellow Jedi assisted in battle, though cautious not to be in the thick of the battle. When the skirmish concluded, a strategy was devised to get into the capital city of [[Iziz]].<ref name=\"A War on Two Fronts\" /> Once in there, Kenobi, Skywalker and Rex decided to leave for Coruscant to report to the Council, leaving Tano as a liaison to the rebels.

You have survived an ordeal few your age could. Welcome home, young Jedi.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|A Necessary Bond}}\nWhile Kenobi was stationed aboard his flagship, the Star Destroyer ''Negotiator'', he was contacted by Jedi initiates aboard the [[transport]] ''[[Crucible]]'', who informed him that their guardian, Ahsoka Tano, had been kidnapped by Hondo Ohnaka's pirates. The younglings said they wanted to rescue Tano from the pirates, but Kenobi told them to stay on the ''Crucible'' for their safety.<ref name=\"Bound for Rescue\">{{TCW|Bound for Rescue}}</ref>\n\n[[File:YoullRegretThat-BFR.png|thumb|left|230px|Kenobi faces off with Grievous in the ''Negotiator'' hangar.]]\nKenobi was intending to send Commander Cody to rescue the stranded Jedi, but his plans were interrupted by an unforeseen [[Attack on Obi-Wan Kenobi's fleet|attack]] by General Grievous on his fleet. Grievous's ships quickly gained the upper hand on Kenobi's, destroying several of his vessels. Upon learning that Grievous had sent a boarding party to board his ship, Kenobi and the clone forces on the ship stationed themselves in the hanger in order to repel it. Grievous himself accompanied the boarding party, and Kenobi began dueling with him as the clone troopers and battle droids engaged each other. Soon, however, Kenobi realized that this was a battle that he could not win, and as he retreated through the passageways of the Star Destroyer he ordered the crew to abandon ship and initiated the ship's [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct sequence]]. When Grievous arrived on the bridge, he found a [[hologram]] recording of Kenobi. Through it, Kenobi conceded the victory to Grievous but informed him that the ship was about to explode. Kenobi escaped the destruction on an escape pod, as did Grievous, who evacuated Kenobi's ship on a shuttle just before it exploded.<ref name=\"Bound for Rescue\" />\n\nSoon after, Kenobi joined Tano, the younglings, who had gone to [[Rescue on Florrum|rescue]] Tano despite Kenobi's orders,<ref name=\"Bound for Rescue\" /> and members of the pirate gang, including Ohnaka himself. After Grievous's defeat of Kenobi, he had [[Battle on Florrum|attacked]] the pirates' stronghold, and the Jedi and pirates had joined forces against Grievous and barely escaped with their lives.<ref name=\"A Necessary Bond\">{{TCW|A Necessary Bond}}</ref>\n\n====D-Squad's mission====\nKenobi was present when the Jedi Council sent Colonel [[Meebur Gascon]] and a [[D-Squad|team]] of droids to [[Mission to Aut-O's flagship|infiltrate]] a Separatist [[Aut-O's flagship|dreadnought]] located deep within Separatist-controlled space, and recover an [[encryption module]], which had been scrambling Separatist communications within the region.<ref name=\"Secret Weapons\">{{TCW|Secret Weapons}}</ref>\n\n====Mission to Bray====\n{{Quote|Life on Bray has always been hard, but since the arrival of the dark lord, it has been a living nightmare.|A Brayan to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle 2}}\n[[File:Ravna_Lord_of_Darkness.png|thumb|right|230px|Dooku introduces the Jedi to Ravna]]\nKenobi, along with Gallia, Cody, and several troops [[Mission to Bray|went]] to [[Bray]] in response to a cry for help. Upon their arrival, the inhabitants told Kenobi about Dark Lord that was plaguing their village was desecrating the [[Citadel of Light]]. Kenobi was skeptical of the natives claims until the power went out and came under attack by several [[Mynock]]s. Kenobi and Gallia decided to investigate the Citadel. They then discovered that the Mynock had affected trooper [[Peel]] and transformed into a [[Unidentified species (Ravna)|creature]]. Kenobi came under attack by Peel until Cody stunned him and locked him away.<ref name=\"Count Dooku: Prince of Darkness!\">[[Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle 2|''Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle'' 2]]</ref>\n\nKenobi, along with Gallia, entered the Citadel to find a cure. Inside, they found Dooku and the Dark Lord [[Ravna]]. Kenobi attempted to use his lightsaber on Ravna to no avail. Ravna was able to subdue Kenobi, while Dooku used his [[Force lightning|lightning]] to subdue Gallia. Kenobi tried to convince Dooku not to use Ravna's powers. However, Ravna betrayed and affected Dooku. Kenobi was able to break through to Dooku by making him give in to his anger and make him attack Ravna. As Dooku used his lightning on Ravna, Kenobi and Gallia were able to use the force to collapse the Citadel and entomb Ravna.<ref name=\"Count Dooku: Prince of Darkness!\" />\n\n===Nearing the end of the war===\n====Mandalore's fall and losing Satine Kryze====\n{{Quote|I lost someone important to me.

The Jedi learned they were headed to [[Florrum]]. There, Kenobi contacted Hondo Ohnaka to inquire about the situation, who said that \"two horned men\" had appeared and threatened to attack his stronghold with pirates who had betrayed him. Kenobi told him he was unable to help him with his men, but that he could help stop the [[Sith]].<ref name=\"Revival\">{{TCW|Revival (episode)|Revival}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TwoOnWan-Revival.png|thumb|left|230px|Obi-Wan Kenobi fights Maul and Savage Opress]]\nKenobi and Gallia managed to engage Maul and Opress just as they began their [[Skirmish on Florrum|attack]] on Florrum. As the fight progressed, Gallia was slain by Opress and, after taking up his fallen comrade's lightsaber to help defend himself, Kenobi was forced to retreat and reunite with Ohnaka. Inside a cave, Ohnaka decided to ambush the men while Kenobi decided to confront Maul and Opress. With great skill and Gallia's lightsaber, Kenobi violently fought the pair, changing to Ataru and demonstrating mastery of his former fighting style. Eventually, he injures Opress' knee and cuts his left arm off. However, before Kenobi could continue the fight, Maul Force-pushed him into another part of the cave, bringing the fight to an end. Realizing their plan had failed, the Dathomirians left and headed off-planet to try again another time. Their ship, however, was shot down and the two were forced to head for an escape pod. As the ship fell, Kenobi went with Hondo to see \"what riches [had] fallen from the sky,\" but there were no signs of Maul nor Opress, leaving Kenobi to doubt their demise.<ref name=\"Revival\" />\n\nFollowing the confrontation, Kenobi returned to Coruscant where he explained to Chancellor Palpatine about the situation regarding Maul, but Palpatine dismissed the Maul's threat, saying that the Jedi needed to focus on the Separatist threat, despite Kenobi's fears of the criminal underworld being a place where Maul could flourish.<ref name=\"Revival\" />\n\nFollowing Maul's [[Takeover of Mandalore|takeover]] of Mandalore, Kenobi was summoned to meet with Yoda and Ki-Adi-Mundi in the communications room. The two showed him a transmission that had been sent by Satine Kryze from Mandalore. In the message, she stated that her government had been overthrown by [[Shadow Collective|rogue criminals]], only for the transmission to be abruptly cut. Despite Yoda and Mundi's reluctance to take part in the internal affairs of Mandalore, Kenobi borrowed the ''[[Twilight]]'' from Skywalker and headed to Sundari. Once on the planet, he tricked a [[Mandalorian super commando|guard]] and took his [[Mandalorian armor|armor]].<ref name=\"The Lawless\">{{TCW|The Lawless}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HoldMeObiWanKenobi-TL.png|thumb|right|230px|Satine Kryze dying in the arms of Kenobi.]]\nDisguised, he freed Kryze from the prison and managed to get all the way to the faulty ship. Realizing that he has arrived, Maul personally hunted down Kenobi and managed to ensure that the ''Twilight'' was shot down before it could leave. After the Jedi jumped from the doomed ship, Maul captured the now-dizzy Kenobi as Opress lifted an unconscious Kryze, and ordered them taken back to the [[Sundari Royal Palace|royal palace]].<ref name=\"The Lawless\" />\n\nMaul, realizing Kenobi's feelings for Satine, decided to execute her with Kenobi watching hoping that he would feel the same pain Maul did when he was forced to live in exile after being brutally injured by Kenobi on Naboo. Maul again attempted to sway Kenobi to the dark side, but the Jedi Master refused. Angered by the comment, as the commandos forced Kenobi to his knees, Maul let Satine go, but stabbed her with the Darksaber. She ultimately died in Kenobi's arms saying with her last breath, that she always loved him and always would. Maul taunted Kenobi but Kenobi replied that only the weak embraced the dark side. Maul, then, had his guards escort Kenobi to a cell where he could \"drown in his misery\" and \"rot.\"<ref name=\"The Lawless\" />\n\n[[File:BoKatanFreesKenobi-TL.png|thumb|left|261x261px|Kenobi freed by Bo-Katan.]]\n[[Bo-Katan Kryze|Bo-Katan]] and her renegade [[Nite Owls]] team, however, intercepted Kenobi as he was being transferred to the prison area. Katan freed Kenobi, and had him help her find Maul and kill him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, Darth Sidious appeared and engaged Maul and Opress in a duel, defeating the former and killing the latter. As the [[Battle of Sundari|conflict]] escalated, Kenobi made his way to his ship and was told by Bo-Katan to warn the Republic of what had happened. Kenobi told her that it would lead to an invasion of Mandalore, but she said that Maul's death would be worth it, and that they would survive. Kenobi, before leaving, asked Bo-Katan if Satine was her sister, and apologized for her loss.<ref name=\"The Lawless\" />\n\nReturning to Coruscant, Kenobi reunited with Skywalker, who asked his former master what had happened. Though his words came with a struggle, Kenobi admitted he had lost \"someone important\" to him. He also revealed that he understood anger in a new way and that he now knew how difficult it was to not give into the emotion.

With Skywalker and Plo Koon doubtful of her guilt, Grand Master Yoda sent the two to find her, but Windu attempted to have Skywalker left out of the matter, believing having him involved would only making things worse due to his emotional bond with Tano. However, Kenobi convinced the Council otherwise, stating Skywalker knew Tano best and that it would be foolish to take him off the mission.<ref name=\"To Catch a Jedi\">{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}}</ref>\n\nAfter her [[Capture of Ahsoka Tano|capture]], Kenobi listened to Tarkin as he informed the Council that the Senate requested for Tano to be expelled from the Jedi Order and turned over to the Republic military so she could receive more \"impartial\" judgement. Kenobi tried to convince his fellow Council members that they should side with Tano, but they all refused to do so, as they feared that protecting Tano would damage their ties with the Senate.

Along with the Council, Kenobi agreed that Tano should rejoin the Order and was present when Windu and Yoda proclaimed her to be a true Jedi, worthy of becoming a Jedi Knight, only for her to refuse readmission. When Skywalker ran after Tano, Kenobi started to follow, but Plo Koon placed a hand on his shoulder, silently advising him not to.

Valorum, however, said that there was no other Jedi sent alongside Syfo-Dyas, but rather his personal aide [[Silman]]. On Oba Diah, Kenobi and Skywalker met [[Lom Pyke]], who denied any involvement until Kenobi noticed that he was wearing the crest of Valorum and Skywalker grabbed the necklace and told the [[Pyke]] to \"stop playing games.\" Lom finally complied with the Jedi, and told them that they had been paid by a man called Tyranus to shoot Sifo-Dyas's shuttle down. However, as they feared that anyone who paid for the death of a Jedi was dangerous, they kept Silman locked away for ten years as insurance.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\nHowever, once they met Silman, they realized he had gone mad after being locked up for so long, and were unable to learn much from him as Dooku arrived to kill him before Kenobi and Skywalker's eyes.

Later, Windu conferred in private with Kenobi that he was worried about Yoda's turmoil and asked him to keep an eye on the old Jedi Master. Soon, however, Yoda revealed to the Council in full that a voice spoke to him from beyond, prompting Kenobi and the entire Council to perform a joint [[meditation]] with him, but they heard nothing.

Before the discussion could go on, Nema then suggested a [[deprivation ritual]] for Yoda to reach Jinn's voice. During the procedure, Kenobi, Skywalker, Mundi and Plo Koon watched over the small Jedi, Yoda managed to hear Jinn's instruction to go to the [[Dagobah system]] before Kenobi noticed his vital signs were dropping too low and stopped the test. When asked about the procedure by Windu, Kenobi told him Yoda was sure he had contacted the dead and, like most, he was in disbelief about the whole ordeal, only for Windu to place guards to keep an eye on Yoda and the small Jedi Master to escape with Skywalker's help and R2-D2's company, willing to go on a journey that would take him to [[Dagobah]], [[Wellspring of Life|a mysterious planet]] and [[Moraband]].<ref name=\"Voices\" /><ref name=\"Destiny\">{{TCW|Destiny (episode)|Destiny}}</ref><ref name=\"Sacrifice\">{{TCW|Sacrifice}}</ref>\n\nOn Yoda's return to Coruscant, Kenobi and Windu greeted him, and Windu asked him if he had gained some insight on how to win the war, but the old Jedi Master told them that he no longer believed that the Jedi could win the Clone Wars but that, through hope and perseverance, the Jedi would ultimately triumph over the Sith.<ref name=\"Sacrifice\" />\n\n====Crystal crisis on Utapau====\n{{Quote|How well would you sleep, knowing that I failed you?''\"<br />\"''Not very well, I imagine. Luckily, that isn't true, and never will be.|Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi|In Search of the Crystal}}\nDuring the last months of the war, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to [[Utapau]] to [[Mission to Utapau|investigate]] the mysterious death of Jedi Master [[Tu-Anh]]. Once they landed on [[Pau City]], they met [[Inspector]] [[Jen June]] who immediately led the [[Pau City Morgue|morgue]] the Jedi's corpse was located. Immediately, the two Jedi examine her body. Soon enough, they went to the place where she had been found, only to determine she had been hit in the optic nerve with a [[Vilmarh's Revenge|precision laser dart]] by a sniper. As they found the sniper's position, they found slime on the floor and interrogated the building's owner, [[Garri]], from whom the two Jedi learned of the involvement of MagnaGuards. Later, they asked Inspector June to analyze the slimy substance; she told them it was the secretion of an [[Amani]]'s skin and added that the Governor [[Torul Blom]] wanted to see them.<ref name=\"A Death on Utapau\">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A_Death_on_Utapau_Ep.png|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi and Skywalker speaking to Inspector June.]]\nThough the Governor asked them to leave Utapau, Kenobi and Skywalker persevered and rented two [[dactillion]]s to go to the city's lower levels and talk to the leader of an Amani tribe there. Told that an Amani outcast had been seen entering a cave not far from there, Kenobi thanked him, and he and Skywalker went to the cave, where they found the MagnaGuards, leading them to suspect of a Separatist conspiracy. Despite some resistance, they managed to get information from the droids that showed them the involvement of the [[Sugi]] and went to see Inspector June once again. After she identified the Amani as coming from the plain, Kenobi contacted the Council to inform them of their findings and later attended together with Skywalker, attended the [[funeral of Tu-Anh]].<ref name=\"A Death on Utapau\" />\n\nSoon after, they reached the Amani settlement they had been looking for, only for their dactillions to be killed and for the Amani to scatter in every direction during the ensuing confrontation, leaving Skywalker and Kenobi to follow the tracks of one that appeared to be their leader. During the hunt, Skywalker mentioned Tano for the first time since her departure, and Kenobi asked if he wanted to talk about it, yet Skywalker refused. Kenobi then suggested for them to set up a camp and rest. However, he insisted on the subject, prompting Skywalker to tell Kenobi he missed Tano and to voice his anger at the High Council for turning its back on her. In response, Kenobi asserted that it had been Tano's decision to leave, and that she had allowed her emotions to cloud her judgement, something against the Jedi way. Then, Kenobi suggested him to rest, but Skywalker declined so that he could keep the first watch. Finally, he questioned Kenobi on what would happen if he had turned out to be a \"major disappointment,\" but Kenobi wanted to believe it would never happen.<ref name=\"In Search of the Crystal\">{{TCW|In Search of the Crystal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal_Crisis_Ep.png|thumb|230px|Kenobi and Skywalker defending a massive kyber crystal.]]\nHowever, they both fell asleep and were captured by a group of Sugis led by [[Chong]], who brought them before [[Endente]] as Kenobi told Chong of their \"intention\" to buy weapons. However, they learned Endente was, in fact, selling a [[kyber crystal]] and Skywalker prompted him to show it before they made the deal. The two Jedi were then brought to the starship where the crystal was being kept and escaped from their captors. Once Skywalker took out all the Sugi and recovered their lightsabers from Chong, they were unable to capture Endente and discovered the massive kyber crystal inside the ship.<ref name=\"In Search of the Crystal\" /> Despite being attacked, the two Jedi managed to transport the crystal through Utapau's plains until they reached Pau City, where Governor Blom showed them his true colors and had the two Jedi surrounded with his men and Grievous's droids. As the kyber crystal was loaded into a shuttle and sent to ship on orbit, Kenobi and Skywalker took June and Blom as hostages, so that their underlings stopped shooting at them, and stole a [[Unidentified freighter (Utapau)|freighter]] to recover the crystal.<ref name=\"Crystal Crisis\">{{TCW|Crystal Crisis}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Big_Bang_Ep.png|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi and Skywalker planning to escape.]]\nDuring the persecution, Kenobi contacted the High Council to inform them of their current course of action, and Grievous soon damaged their ship, forcing them to, performing a [[number five special]], crash the ship to damage the hyperdrive and board the ship where the crystal was then held. However, they got separated, and Kenobi landed in a [[hangar]] full of droids, where he was soon confronted and captured by Grievous. Following Dooku's orders to execute him, Kenobi was being escorted to the execution room until Skywalker rescued him. Together, their made their way to the kyber crystal at the vault, where they were temporarily trapped until a squad discovered them. Using the crystal and the Force to knock them out, he managed to get to a hangar where Skywalker got a shuttle for them to escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi set several [[Armored Assault Tank Mk I|AATs]] to shoot and overload the crystal, destroying the crystal and the ship, and escaping from the explosion in the nick of time.<ref name=\"The Big Bang\" />\n\nBack on Coruscant, Kenobi and Skywalker reported to the Council about the outcome of their mission, when Yoda told them of the use of kyber crystals on weapons of unimaginable power in ancient times.<ref name=\"The Big Bang\" />\n\n====The dark disciples====\n{{Quote|You were fighting her and chatting at the same time?''\"<br />\"''It's...

Though Kenobi was against the idea, he nevertheless suggested Quinlan Vos to be deployed for the mission.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nOnce Vos returned to Coruscant from his covert mission in [[Otor's Hub]] after ending [[Sheb Valaad]]'s [[black market]] operation, Kenobi greeted him at the Jedi Temple and accompanied him to the [[Jedi Council Chamber]]. There, Vos was informed of his mission, and Ventress's role in it; Vos accepted. At the end of the session, Kenobi went to Vos' encounter at the dining hall and gave him more details about Ventress's character. Afterwards, Kenobi and Vos would prearrange to meet at a bar in [[Level 1313]] so that Vos would keep him appraised of his progress at regular intervals. Vos' absence in their third and fourth would-be encounters forced Kenobi to report to the Council.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nAt one such meeting, Ventress was the one to appear at the bar, after her [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|mission]] to rescue Vos from Serenno after he had been captured following their [[Mission to Raxus Secundus|failed attempt]] to kill Dooku, she told Kenobi that they had lost Vos to Dooku and the dark side; the two sat there, together, for a long time.

Though the Shadow Collective had managed to collect most traces of their presence in the [[Ord Mantell City|city]], [[Wolffe]] and his men uncovered a Mandalorian helmet outside the town, which led the four Jedi on the trail of Maul.<ref name=\"DM:SoD\">[[Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir 3|''Darth Maul&mdash;Son of Dathomir'' 3]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Assault_on_Mandalorian_supply_outpost.png|thumb|left|251x251px|Kenobi and Tiplee assaulting Maul's hideout.]]\nAware of the [[Black Sun]]'s presence on the system, and the location of [[Vizsla Keep 09]], a Mandalorian supply outpost suspected to be Maul's hideout, Kenobi and Tiplee led an [[Assault on Vizsla Keep 09|assault]] to lock the place down until reinforcements arrived. Tiplee expressed concern that Obi-Wan would allow his feelings for Satine to cloud his judgement when facing Maul, but he assured her that he would be under control and wouldn't fail the mission. As the two Jedi tried to reach the command center, Maul and Count Dooku appeared to duel them, with Windu and Secura joining them soon afterwards. Despite their advantage over the Sith, Tiplee was killed by Dooku, and a Mandalorian assisted Maul by setting off an explosion that injured Windu and Secura. The Sith, then, managed to escape as Maul told Kenobi not to worry, as they would be seeing each other again soon; his alliance with Dooku leaving the Jedi perplexed as to what had just happened.<ref name=\"DM:SoD\" />\n\n====Vos' rescue====\n{{Quote|Ventress is at fault, yes, and of course Dooku.

Despite Windu's open disapproval, Yoda allowed Kenobi and Skywalker to go with Ventress to rescue Vos. Soon enough, Kenobi, Skywalker and Ventress were on the cockpit of her ship, the [[Banshee (starship)|''Banshee'']], to [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|infiltrate]] the Separatist dreadnought where Vos, or rather \"Admiral Enigma,\" was issuing orders from.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nStealthily, the three made their way to the bridge where Skywalker dueled Dooku, while Kenobi and Ventress discovered Vos was still being held captive by the Count. However, Ventress saw through his ruse and tried to relieve Vos from an existence consumed by hatred, but Kenobi convinced her to escape before taking such an extreme action. Barely escaping on the ''Banshee'', they made their way back to Coruscant, and Kenobi saw as the Council welcomed Vos and pardoned Ventress.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n====Redemption of the fallen====\n{{Quote|You misunderstand, Master Windu.

However, their mission went awry when Vos, unbeknownst to them, arranged the base's destruction. Later on, Kenobi and Vos would be [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|deployed]] to a [[Vanqor listening post|listening post]] on Vanqor, but their second fruitless campaign in a row made Kenobi suspicious of a leak. He confided his feelings to Yoda and Windu, leading them to suspect Vos was the leak. Kenobi would later be summoned by Yoda to tell him that he had sensed concealed darkness in Vos' soul, and the Council arranged an emergency session, in which they entertained the option of executing Vos. Kenobi, however, protested against the idea,and suggested sending Vos again to assassinate Dooku to test his allegiances.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n[[File:Insider204-Kenobi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Traveling to Christophsis, Obi-Wan Kenobi bore witness to Quinlan Vos's actions.]]\nAfterwards, Vos had Ventress tell the Council of the Count and Grievous' [[Second battle of Christophsis|presence]] on Christophsis, and the two set out on their mission aboard the ''Banshee''. Kenobi and Skywalker followed suit and spied on Vos, who reunited with Dooku; they observed as the two dueled, when Vos gained the upper hand just as he let Dooku live as long as he told him about his Master's whereabouts. It was then that Kenobi and Skywalker intervened, taking the pair by surprised, and placed them under arrest. The two soon escaped from the [[Vigilance (Venator-class)|''Vigilance'']], causing the death of Akar-Deshu and the [[Chagrian]] [[Kav Bayons]], and boarded the ''Banshee'', but Skywalker's quick thinking forced the renegades to crash land on the planet.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nThe two Jedi pursued the three injured renegades to a [[Christophsis Separatist tower|Separatist tower]], where they surrounded them and where he and Skywalker witnessed Ventress' last moments. They transported Vos back to Coruscant where the fallen Jedi confessed all his crimes and Kenobi defended Ventress. After being placed under Yoda's supervision for some time, Vos was released to Kenobi's care to take Ventress' body back to Dathomir, where she would be finally reunited with her sisters.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\n====Attack on the Jedi temple====\nSometime after Jedi Master [[Depa Billaba]] met youngling [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], Kenobi gave a lecture in the [[Jedi Temple central security station]] for younglings to learn about the Jedi recall signal, when Dume asked whether the same system could be used to warn Jedi away. Kenobi was intrigued by the possibility,<ref name=\"A New Dawn\">[[A New Dawn (novel)|''A New Dawn'']]</ref> and the idea would later prove essential.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Kenobi was later present at the temple when it was [[Bombing at the Jedi Temple|attacked]] by Separatist general [[Rackham Sear]].

[[Clone Sergeant]] \"[[Hunter]]\" stated that Clone Force 99 would be heading to the planet as well. Skywalker believed Kenobi would approve the mission, but, while Rex was eager to go, believing ARC trooper Echo was still alive, Skywalker reminded his Captain that they had a \"thing\" to do; Skywalker was to contact his secret wife, Senator Amidala. Skywalker spoke to her via hologram inside the barracks with Rex keeping watch outside, but Kenobi approached Rex to ask where Skywalker was. Rex attempted to cover for his friend, but Skywalker soon exited, and the two began to depart for the ''[[Havoc Marauder]]''. However, Kenobi called after Skywalker and revealed he knew his former Padawan had been speaking with Amidala.<ref name=\"A Distant Echo\">{{TCW|A Distant Echo}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EpGuide704.png|thumb|left|258x258px|Kenobi and Windu on Anaxes]]\nAfter their success, Kenobi took part on Windu's debriefing on the strategy to take the [[Anaxes assembly complex|Separatist assembly complex]] by air, when Echo posed his plan to be escorted by the Bad Batch into Trench's new comm vault on a [[Providence-class Dreadnought|dreadnought]] on the planet's orbit and plug himself to feed the Separatist's strategic movements. Kenobi took part on the assault and the combined efforts managed to take the complex under their control and, with all other fronts falling to the Republic, Trench initiated a countdown for an explosion that could destroy most of Anaxes. While Windu deactivated the bomb, Kenobi assisted in the evacuation efforts; with Trench's death at the hands of Skywalker and his fleet's destruction, the battle was won. Thanking Captain Rex, Corporal Echo, and the Bad Batch, Kenobi told the clones they would receive medals for their actions, but the Bad Batch intended to leave before the ceremony. Additionally, Echo decided to leave with the batch.<ref name=\"Unfinished Business\">{{TCW|Unfinished Business}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Yerbana====\n{{Quote|Yes, Cody.

During the battle, Kenobi took his 212th Attack Battalion to fight in one front, while Skywalker led his 501st Legion into another offensive. The battle proved to be more brutal and problematic than expected to Kenobi and his clone troopers, who were suffering heavily damages from the Droids attacks, and were unable to destroy the commander droid. After saving Cody from a missile, Kenobi ordered his troopers to take cover. Kenobi wondered where his padawan was as he needed his assistance. Fortunately, Skywalker, who successfully defeated the Separatist army in his offensive, arrived and convinced Kenobi to let him act as he had planned. Knowing that Skywalker had already decided how to act and would not change his mind, Kenobi gave his Apprentice the leadership of the battle. Skywalker faked a surrender to draw out the droid commander. After using his Force abilities to destroy it, Skywalker ordered his 501st Legion led by Captain Rex to attack rest of the droid army.<ref name=\"Old Friends\">{{TCW|Old Friends Not Forgotten}}</ref>\n\nKenobi then gave permission to Cody to lead the 212th Attack Battalion in helping the 501st. Kenobi approached Skywalker complimenting him for his help, to which Skywalker thanked him for pretending to be defeated. Kenobi said he was always glad to help. However, the two were contacted by Admiral Wullf Yularen who informed them of a transmission going under the code \"Fulcrum.\" Skywalker guessed it might be Saw Gerrera, which worried Kenobi about the current state of the [[siege at Onderon]]. Yularen denied it was Gerrera and requests the Generals to attend the call.<ref name=\"Old Friends\" />\n\n====Locating Maul====\n{{Quote|I killed Maul once. Best to capture him. He doesn't seem to stay dead.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Ahsoka Tano|Old Friends Not Forgotten}}\nAt Yularen's ship, Kenobi and Skywalker entered the room only to witness Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze as the ones that had made the call. Kenobi asked Tano what was the information she had. Tano informed them that that Maul had been located on Mandalore and they had an opportunity to capture him.<ref name=\"Old Friends\" />\n\nWhile going to greet Tano and her allies, Skywalker, who was still emotionally shocked to see his former apprentice again, claimed that it all made sense, in an attempt to understand Tano's decision to leave the Jedi Order. Skywalker told Kenobi that if Tano had not left the Order, then Maul would have never been located. As always, Kenobi was more reserved about the situation and decided to wait and see how the events were to develop, remaining cautiously optimistic.<ref name=\"Old Friends\" />\n\nAfter a quick greeting, Tano, Kryze and her Mandalorians were led by Kenobi to a private room to discuss Maul's whereabouts. However, Kenobi was not willing to help Tano and her allies unless the Jedi Council gave their permission. Kryze explained that there was not time to turn that into a bureaucratic decision as Maul could escape before they made an offensive. Kryze reminded Kenobi that the former Sith Lord killed [[Satine Kryze]] and confronted Kenobi about how could he not want to capture Maul as Satine was supposedly important to him. Kenobi reassured Bo-Katan that he still cared deeply about Satine, but he could not allow his feelings to cloud his judgment. Kenobi proceeded to consult the Jedi Council.<ref name=\"Old Friends\" />\n\n====Rescue of the Chancellor====\n{{Quote|So that's it?

He immediately informed Tano and Skywalker of this, at the same time ordering their fleet to travel to Coruscant, insisting their priority was to help Palpatine, who could be in danger. This angered Tano, who accused her former masters of choosing to abandon Mandalore. Somewhat shocked by the accusation, Kenobi urged Tano to understand that they were entering a pivotal moment in the Clone Wars, as the heart of the Republic was under attack. Tano countered that Kenobi was playing politics, and pointed out how the Jedi Order had lost their way by forgetting that their duty was to help people and not politicians, which was why the people (and Tano herself) had lost faith in them. Kenobi countered that the people of Coruscant needed them, but Tano believed that it was really about saving the Chancellor. Kenobi told Tano to be fair, but Tano retorted that she wasn't trying to play fair. Skywalker heard the argument and weighed in. So as to help Tano in the upcoming siege without compromising Mandalore's neutrality and the mission to rescue the Chancellor, Skywalker promoted Rex to Commander so he could lead the mission and had Tano assisting him as an advisor. When Kenobi agreed, Tano accepted the proposal. Kenobi advised Tano to capture, not kill, Maul before leaving the room to prepare the troops, leaving Skywalker and Tano behind.<ref name=\"Old Friends\" />\n\n[[File:Drop_Em_AtG.png|thumb|250px|Kenobi and Skywalker inadvertently enter an elevator full of battle droids after boarding ''Invisible Hand''.|left]]\nAfter Skywalker and Tano wished each other good luck on their respective missions,<ref name=\"Old Friends\" /> Kenobi and Skywalker traveled to Coruscant to rescue the Chancellor. The two Jedi fought their way through a Separatist blockade and managed to board the ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', only to find the Chancellor being held prisoner at the top of the ship's observation spire. Not long after they arrived to the room, Count Dooku appeared before them and the two Jedi engaged him in a duel.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nThough Dooku managed to gain the upper hand and knocked Kenobi out cold, Skywalker was able to defeat the Sith Lord, and subsequently executed him at Palpatine's urging. He then rescued Kenobi, carrying him until he woke up when they were hanging in an elevator. As they got out of there and ran through hallway 328, Grievous had them trapped in a ray shield and brought to the ''Invisible Hand''{{'s}} control room. The cyborg General personally taunted them, giving R2-D2 enough time to free them and for Kenobi and Skywalker to confront Grievous. The General, however, escaped in an escape pod and forced the two Jedi to pilot the ship and land on Coruscant as safely as they could. Following the ordeal, they escorted the Chancellor to the Senate building, where they separated, with Kenobi going back to Jedi Temple to report to the Council of Dooku's demise and what it meant to the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Dividing friendship====\n{{Quote|All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, on Anakin's appointment with Palpatine|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}\nLater, Kenobi attended another meeting, concerning the reports on the Outer Rim Sieges, including Saleucami's fall and the move of Quinlan Vos' troops to [[Boz Pity]]. At the end of the session, he met with Skywalker and told him to be careful with Palpatine, and that Palpatine had requested his presence for unknown reasons. Soon enough, Kenobi and the Council were made aware that the Chancellor had Skywalker appointed as his Personal Representative on the Jedi Council; though the Council approved of the appointment, they denied Skywalker the rank of Jedi Master, a decision which greatly angered Skywalker, prompting him to question the Council's decision-making. Kenobi remained silent. After being admonished by Windu, Skywalker reluctantly accepted his position and took his seat on the Council. During the same meeting, Kenobi and Master Mundi discussed the importance of [[Kashyyyk]], prompting Master Yoda to assist the [[Wookiee]]s himself.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Council_RotS.png|thumb|right|306x306px|Kenobi deliberating with the Council]]\nAt the end of the meeting, Kenobi acknowledged to Skywalker that his appointment had been accepted so that, on behalf of the Council, Skywalker could spy on the Chancellor, an assignment that Anakin refused to partake in because he believed it to be an act of treason. He tried to convince Anakin that something out of place had to be happening for Palpatine to remain in office long after his two legitimate terms had expired and to have accumulated an unnatural amount of executive powers, but still, Anakin would have none of it. Later, before Yoda's departure to Kashyyyk, Kenobi conferred with Windu and Yoda of Skywalker's reluctant compliance on his task, when he heard of Windu's distrust of the Jedi Knight and Yoda's doubts about the prophecy of the \"Chosen One.\"<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nFollowing the Chancellor's disclosure of General Grievous' location on Utapau to Skywalker, who then passed it onto the Council, Kenobi was sent to capture the fugitive General.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Immediately prior to his voyage to Utapau, Kenobi contacted Tano and the Mandalorians on Mandalore via hologram. Kryze told him that the clones had been extremely effective against Maul's forces. While communing, Tano mentioned that Maul had said the name Darth Sidious while they confronted one another and Kryze asked who he was. Kenobi admitted that the Jedi did not know much about him, but told them that he orchestrated the Clone Wars and manipulated both sides of the conflict. He soon informed them about the death of Count Dooku during the Battle of Coruscant after Tano asked why they would no longer be able to get anymore information from him about Sidious. With this, he asked them once again to capture Maul so that they may finally be able to put an end to the mystery of Sidious. Tano asked for reinforcements, but Kenobi was forced to tell them that he was being sent to capture Grievous on Utapau and that he was unable to send support. Tano then asked if Skywalker could provide support to which Kenobi asked to speak to Tano in private.<ref name=\"Phantom Apprentice2\">{{TCW|The Phantom Apprentice}}</ref>\n[[File:KenobiConferenceCall-TPA.png|left|thumb|322x322px|Obi-Wan shares his knowledge of Sidious with Ahsoka, Bo-Katan, and Rex.]]\nAfter Rex and Kryze left, he informed Tano of Skywalker's mission to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by the Jedi High Council. After Tano began to ask why they would give him such an assignment, Kenobi informed her that the Council wished to learn what Palpatine was truly plotting after remaining in the office of Supreme Chancellor long after his term's conclusion. Tano began to argue with Kenobi and said that she couldn't imagine Skywalker could be happy with the burden the Council had placed upon him. Kenobi knew this and informed Tano as much, asking her to speak with him after their meeting ended to help him with his burden. Tano began to grow increasingly agitated with the Council after Kenobi asked this, but Kenobi revealed that he knew the Council wasn't correct in every one of their decisions and that if Tano communicated with Skywalker, it could help them. Before Tano could respond, Rex rushed in and informed the two that there had been an attack and with that, Kenobi allowed her to leave. Before Tano left, she asked him to tell Skywalker something that she left unspoken. Kenobi assured her that he would and, with this, ended the transmission.<ref name=\"Phantom Apprentice2\" />\n\nBefore Kenobi's departure to engage Grievous, Skywalker apologized to Kenobi, who told him that he needed patience and that he would soon become a master. The two exchanged goodbyes in what would be their last meeting as friends and allies (a fact neither was aware of) before Kenobi departed for Utapau.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Final clash with Grievous====\n{{Quote|Hello there!''\"<br />\"''General Kenobi!

Kenobi took this under advisement and hid out of sight after instructing his new astromech, [[R4-G9]], to leave the [[spaceport]] in his Jedi interceptor, tricking the spying droids into thinking that he had left. Mounted on the [[varactyl]] [[Boga]], Kenobi made his way to the Separatist holdout and waited for the [[Executive Separatist Council|Separatist Council]] to depart. He then leaped down from the scaffolding where he had been hidden and greeted General Grievous before being surrounded by various types of battle droids. Grievous ordered his magnaguards to dispatch Kenobi, who managed to crush them under a piece of the ceiling without engaging in combat. Upon this, Grievous challenged Kenobi to combat directly, and engaged the Jedi wielding four lightsabers. Kenobi managed to sever two of the General's hands and keep up a solid defense against his unrelenting attacks. Not long into the duel, the 212th Attack Battalion arrived and [[Battle of Utapau|engaged]] Grievous's forces.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Obiwanshoots.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Obi-Wan ends Grievous with his own blaster.]]\nAs the battle intensified, Kenobi threw Grievous against a wall, knocking his remaining sabers out of his hands and forcing him to escape in his [[TSMEU-6 personal wheel bike|wheelbike]]. Kenobi chased after the fleeing [[cyborg]] on Boga, though his lightsaber was knocked out of his hand and recovered by Commander Cody hundreds of [[meter]]s below. As they raced along, Kenobi dueled Grievous at breakneck speed, using the [[electrostaff]] that the general stored on the wheelbike and eventually being pulled onto the vehicle itself along with him. They eventually arrived at a landing platform, where they engaged in a swift fight using hand-to-hand combat, as well as both the electrostaff and Grievous's [[Grievance Striker]] [[DT-57 \"Annihilator\" blaster|blaster]]; during the conflict, Kenobi managed to partially tear open Grievous's chest armor, exposing his gutsack. Kenobi was eventually thrown to the edge of the platform, but was able to summon the Grievance Striker to him just before Grievous could finish him off, firing five shots into his gut sack, igniting it and burning Grievous from the inside-out. With his long-time rival and the [[Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies|Supreme Commander of the Droid Army]] slain, Kenobi headed off to rejoin his troops.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n====Order 66====\n{{Quote|My clone troops turned on me.

The clone then returned him his lightsaber, and Kenobi proceeded to climb with Boga, just as Cody received a direct message from Palpatine, telling him to execute the order. Before Kenobi went too far, Cody ordered his men to shoot at the Jedi Master, bringing his fall to the water below. However, unlike many others, he survived and managed to climb on his own while evading troops, only to discover the attack had been intentional.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Obi-Wan_Kenobi_and_Bail_Organa_Discuss_The_Situation.png|thumb|270x270px|right|Kenobi and Bail Organa discussing with Yoda.]]\nTaking [[Soulless One|Grievous' starfighter]], he left Utapau and made contact with Senator Bail Organa, who had seen the [[siege of the Jedi Temple]] firsthand and was trying to locate other surviving Jedi. Reuniting on the ''[[Tantive III]]'', Kenobi met with the Senator and Master Yoda, who told him of the retreat message telling all Jedi to return to the Temple, saying that the war was over. Kenobi then suggested to dismantle the signal, so that others wouldn't fall into the trap, and Yoda agreed.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nOn their way to Coruscant, Organa was contacted by [[Vice Chair|Vice Chancellor]] Amedda, who told him of an emergency session to be held by the Senate. Kenobi and Yoda entered the Jedi Temple and witnessed with their own eyes the massacre that just taken place.

Kenobi expressed that Skywalker was like a brother to him and that he did not have the heart to kill him, but Yoda explained that the boy he had trained no longer existed and that he needed to be put out of his misery, and told Kenobi to use his instincts to find Vader.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nAfter that, he visited Senator Amidala, thinking she might know of Vader's location. He revealed what he'd discovered about Skywalker's betrayal of the Jedi and how the Clone Wars had been a lie orchestrated by Palpatine. Amidala harshly denounced Kenobi's accusations, believing that Obi-Wan intended to kill Anakin if she revealed where he'd gone.

Hiding in one of the compartments, Kenobi emerged from the ship, only for Vader to think she had brought Kenobi to kill him and [[Force choke|choked]] her in a paranoid rage. As Kenobi checked her vital signs, Vader accused him of trying to turn her against him, but the Jedi Master stated that his anger and lust for power had already done that, and that he had allowed Sidious to twist his mind until he became the very thing he had sworn to destroy.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:Kenobi_Vader_Mustafar.png|thumb|right|250x250px|Kenobi battled his former apprentice in an intense and emotional duel]]\nUnaffected by the Jedi's \"lies\" and unafraid of the dark side, Vader claimed that he'd brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to \"[his] new Empire,\" and told Kenobi that if he was not on his side, then, he was his enemy. Realizing that his former apprentice was already too far gone to be reasoned with, Kenobi vowed to stop him at all costs, prompting the two to engage in a ferocious [[Duel on Mustafar|duel]] that caused substantial damage to the facility, just as Yoda and Sidious [[Duel in the Galactic Senate|dueled]] in the Senate. Ultimately, Kenobi and Vader were hovering over the lava sea, when the Jedi Master reflected on his failure while Vader stated that he should have known about the Jedi's lust for power and domination.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Kenobi tried again in vain to convince Vader that Sidious was, in fact, an evil mastermind, but Vader continued to denounced the Jedi as the true evil.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:High_ground.png|left|thumb|276x276px|Obi-Wan claimed the high ground in a pivotal move in his duel against Vader ]]Eventually, Kenobi jumped to high ground on the embankment of the lava river, gaining advantage over Vader. Despite Kenobi's warning not to try the jump, the Sith apprentice ignored him and did so anyway, allowing Kenobi to sever his remaining natural arm and both legs in one strike. Heartbroken over his former pupil's fall to the dark side, Kenobi retrieved Vader's [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]] and tearfully expressed his disgust and sadness over Vader's betrayal of the Jedi Order, shouting that his destiny was to restore balance to the Force and defeat the Sith, not join them and leave the Force in darkness. Vader responded by screaming that he hated his former master, his voice shaking with rage and despair. This statement only further crushed Kenobi, who responded that he had loved him like a brother.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nVader's garments then burst into flames from the lava, severely burning him. Unwilling to help his former friend or murder him in cold blood, Kenobi left him to his apparent fate and returned to Amidala's ship, where C-3PO had already brought her back on board.

Kenobi volunteered to take Luke to Tatooine where the boy would live with Skywalker's step family, [[Owen Lars|Owen]] and [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Lars]]. Kenobi also pledged that he would watch over him. As the trio prepared to go their separate ways, Yoda asked Kenobi to remain for a brief moment, revealing that he had training for him during his solitude on Tatooine and that Qui-Gon Jinn had reached the path to [[immortality]], having returned from the [[Netherworld of the Force]].

We don't need you at all. I could have handled this alone.|Owen Lars, to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Time of Death}}\nOn one particular morning, Kenobi was awoken by sensing a young 3-year-old Luke Skywalker and his family in danger. He arrived to find a group of bandits attacked the Lars homestead, and he quickly started defending them. After successfully defeating the last of the bandits, he was punched to the ground by Owen for his interference and his influence on Luke getting involved. Out of fear that the boy could become like his father, Owen shouted for Kenobi to never come back.<ref name=\"Time of Death\" />\n\nKenobi came to consider that morning the moment he had failed the young Skywalker. Both he and Owen had seen the defiance and bravery in the boy's eyes, yet Kenobi listened to Owen, staying away instead of training Luke.<ref name=\"Time of Death\" />\n\n=====The Journals of Ben Kenobi=====\n[[File:Ben_Kenobi_saves_young_Luke.png|thumb|right|208x208px|Kenobi saves 8-year-old Luke]]\nIn preparation for Luke's future training, Kenobi wrote [[The Journals of Ben Kenobi|a set of journals]] and placed them in a box labeled \"For Luke.\"<ref name=\"Star Wars 6\">[[Star Wars (2015) 6|''Star Wars'' (2015) 6]]</ref> In one of his journals, Kenobi wrote about how he stopped Jabba the Hutt's men from collecting their \"[[water tax]]\" on the local [[Moisture farmer|farmers]] during the [[Great Drought]]. He kept Jabba's thugs from extorting the Lars family into paying their water tax; following an action which involved subtle use of the Force to cause the thugs' firearms to misfire with the intention of preventing harm from coming to the townspeople, he decided not to go into town anymore.<ref name=\"SW7\" />\n\nThat same night, he sensed Skywalker to be in danger, for the boy had gone to take the water back from Jabba's men and give it back to the farmers. Kenobi went to the encounter, but blew their vehicle's lights with the Force to hide his identity and proceeded to disable all of Jabba's henchmen with the Force. One of them became startled and pushed Skywalker to the ground, causing him to hit his head and pass out. Once Kenobi handled all the thugs, he carried Skywalker to the Lars' homestead and left before he woke up. Luke's courage assured Kenobi that it wasn't the end of the Jedi and renewed his up-until-then waning hope.<ref name=\"SW7\" />\n\n[[File:Star_Wars_15.jpg|thumb|254x254px|Obi-Wan in exile|left]]\nA year later the Great Drought had ended, and Kenobi found himself observing a young Luke piloting a [[T-16 skyhopper]] through [[Beggar's Canyon]]. Kenobi noted how similar Luke was to his father Anakin, and expressed worry at the prospect. While attempting to impress his friends with an ostentatious maneuver through the canyon, Luke badly damaged the skyhopper and was subsequently grounded from flying by his uncle. Kenobi, feeling sympathy for the boy, took a job protecting a [[Jawa]] [[sandcrawler]] that had been experiencing troublesome raids by [[Tusken Raider]]s. That night, Kenobi meditated outside of the sandcrawler, communing with Qui-Gon and expressing his hope in Luke's abilities. Soon the Tusken Raiders arrived and Kenobi was able to easily dispatch the party with a disarmed raider's [[Gaderffii stick]]. He used whatever payment he earned from the job to hire the Jawas to deliver the necessary parts to fix the skyhopper. At a droid auction at an unidentified outpost, Luke received the the parts Kenobi had provided for him. Luke believed the parts had been a gift from his uncle and thanked Owen, as he eagerly rushed back home. Deriving pleasure from the boy's enthusiasm, Kenobi grinned fondly as he observed from behind a nearby tent.<ref name=\"SW15\" />\n\n[[File:Star_Wars_20_textless_cover.png|thumb|right|291x291px|Black Krrsantan vs Obi-Wan Kenobi]]\nLater that day in his hut, Kenobi was cooking dinner when he was interrupted by a visit from Owen. Owen had put two and two together and sternly demanded that Kenobi have no part in his family's life. He had brought back the box of tools that he presumably confiscated from Luke, and dumped it on the floor of the hut. Kenobi responded back with several snarky replies before finally relenting and saying he that he only ever wanted to help. Owen continued to berate him, calling him dangerous and troublesome. As Owen departed, Kenobi regretfully admitted to himself that danger did in fact seem to follow him. But he steeled his resolve and claimed that no danger would come to the young Skywalker boy as long as he lived. Coincidentally, Jabba the Hutt chose this time to send a Wookiee bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]] after Owen, who he believed was responsible for roughing up his tax collectors during the Great Drought.<ref name=\"SW15\" /> The next day, Owen had a change of heart and himself purchased a box of parts. He searched through the Lars homestead looking for Luke, hoping to fix the skyhopper with the boy as a way to apologize for his coarse actions the previous day. However, he was ambushed by Black Krrsantan and kidnapped. Luke, in childish defiance, was running away from home. He made it a short distance out before sensing \u2013 likely through the Force \u2013 that something had gone awry at the homestead. Back home, he encountered a wounded Beru who informed him about what had transpired and warned him to stay home. She ran out of the house armed with a rifle, leaving Luke with the discarded pile of tools Owen had earlier dropped.<ref name=\"SW20\">[[Star Wars (2015) 20|''Star Wars'' (2015) 20]]</ref>\n\nWhile meditating in the [[Dune Sea]] among a herd of [[Bantha]]s, Kenobi felt a disturbance in the Force. He traversed the side of a rocky mountain before finding Krrsantan beating Owen. In the ensuing conflict, Kenobi was trapped under a mesh of [[stun net]] that was dispatched by the Wookiee. Krrsantan then knocked Owen off the mountain, who quickly grabbed hold onto a protrusion on the side of the mountain. Kenobi escaped the net and stunned the Wookiee, sprinting over to Owen to grab him back up. However, Krrsantan intervened and threw an enormous boulder at Kenobi. Kenobi used his lightsaber to split the rock in two, also blinding Krrsantan in one eye during the process. The debris from the rock crashed into Owen's ledge and he nearly fell if not for Kenobi's use of the Force. Kenobi held Owen in place using the Force before losing focus as a result of Krrsantan's constant attacks. Owen fell, but was deftly saved by Luke, who used the repaired skyhopper's turret to break Owen's fall. Kenobi then used this opportunity to disarm the Wookiee, who plunged off the side of the mountain. He did not die however, and proceeded off-world to escape Jabba's wrath. Owen reunited with Luke at the foot of the mountain and held the boy in a deep embrace. He cast a knowing glance up toward Kenobi who looked on in triumph.<ref name=\"SW20\" />\n\nThere were no words of thanks exchanged between Owen and Kenobi, but Kenobi was simply happy to see the family reunited. Kenobi then returned to his family, which was what he fondly called his herd of Banthas. Among them, he looked up into the sky to see Luke's skyhopper, soaring off into the sunset.<ref name=\"SW20\" />\n\nKenobi was later visiting [[Mos Eisley]] for supplies when he experienced a vision of a mysterious man. Kenobi recognized the man as [[Garro]] from a tale Jedi Master Yoda had told him. He would go on to recount this in his journal.<ref name=\"Star Wars 28\">[[Star Wars (2015) 28|''Star Wars'' (2015) 28]]</ref>\n\n=====Introducing himself=====\nWhen Skywalker was twelve years old,<ref name=\"Complete Visual New\" /> he went on an adventure with his friend [[Windy]], riding a [[dewback]], but they soon encountered a [[sandstorm]] and both lost consciousness. When Skywalker awoke, there was a [[krayt dragon]] nearby sneaking up on him. Just as the dragon attempted to attack, Kenobi appeared and beheaded the giant creature. When Skywalker asked who he was, Kenobi answered that his name was \"Ben Kenobi\" and revealed that he was an old friend of Skywalker's father.<ref name=\"Line Webtoon\">''[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)]]''</ref>\n\nKenobi took Skywalker and Windy back to their village, meeting with Skywalker's uncle, Owen Lars. Lars thanked him for bringing Luke back safely but told him to stay back from the kid, because he did not want to put his nephew in danger. In return, Kenobi said he was observing Skywalker and claimed that the Force was strong in him, telling Lars that he would leave the farm one day. Lars responded that the Jedi were done since the Republic had fallen, warning him once again to never visit their homestead again.<ref name=\"Line Webtoon\" />\n\n=====The Knight and the Dragon=====\n[[File:The_Knight_and_the_Dragon_SWMaF.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Knight faces the Dragon.]]\nAt some point in time, a story was spread about a particular event that supposedly happened on Tatooine. They told of a figure simply known as a 'knight' who was intent on avoiding his enemies whilst on a continuing mission to complete a final duty. One day the knight came to learn of the actions of a nomadic tribe that had been raiding other settlements and capturing prisoners. Following one of these raiding parties back to their village, he soon learned that their actions were motivated by a desire for self-preservation due to the carnivorous demands of a dragon known as [[Krayt (krayt dragon)|Krayt]]. Upon being discovered, the knight was held in captivity with the others which gave him the opportunity to break out all of the other prisoners while he stayed behind. Angered by his actions, the nomadic tribe placed him in view of the dragon, offering him up in sacrifice. Slipping free of his bonds, the knight produced a glowing sword of light which he used to hold back the flying dragon for a time. For more than an hour, he and the dragon engaged in a sort of dance, with neither one able to wound the other. Finally, the dragon sensed an opening when the knight seemed to tire. Just as the dragon was about to pounce, the knight held up his hand which seemed to have a gradual effect of pacifying his foe. Upon seeing the knight exercise control upon the creature, the nomads cheered. The knight, however, chastised them for their actions. He stated that while the dragon would no longer bother them, any whisper of wrongdoing from their end would lead to him and the dragon returning to punish them. The knight thus led the dragon away, never to be seen again. His actions eventually led to the nomadic tribe forever ceasing any attempts to raid or kidnap from other settlements, a trait which became unique to them.<ref name=\"The Knight & the Dragon\">{{Shortstory|story=The Knight & the Dragon|sformatted=The Knight & the Dragon|book=Myths & Fables}}</ref>\n\n=====The Oil-Bringer=====\nKenobi took actions to aid and repair the droids of Tatooine, which earned him the moniker of the Oil-Bringer. Tales said that his heroics took place on a single night once a year, and that he traversed the entire galaxy. Kenobi rescued one such droid, LA-R1, and its companions from the clutches of Jawas.<ref name=\"Disney.com\">{{Disney|books|book/star-wars-life-day-treasury|Star Wars Life Day Treasury|archivedate=20210901000005}}</ref>\n\n=====Encountering Maul=====\n{{Quote|Look what has become of you.

Kenobi managed to keep Maul from tracking him until Maul used a [[Sith holocron]] to lure [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] Padawan [[Ezra Bridger]] from his base on the planet [[Atollon]] to Tatooine, hoping the young Jedi's pain would be enough to draw Kenobi out. Kenobi found Ezra unconscious in the Dune Sea and sheltered him from the storm. Ezra regained consciousness and, knowing of Maul's hatred towards Kenobi from his own encounters with the former Sith, tried to warn Obi-Wan of Maul's presence. Kenobi calmly replied that he knew of it already and that he hadn't gone into hiding unprepared. He told Ezra that it was Ezra's responsibility to help the Rebellion; not to handle Maul. That burden fell upon Kenobi himself.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bitter_Rivalry_AtG.png|left|thumb|230x230px|Kenobi duels his old foe Maul one last time]]\nSoon thereafter Maul arrived, seething with rage upon seeing his old rival after so many years. Kenobi sent Bridger off on a dewback toward [[Nightbrother (Gauntlet fighter)|Maul's ship]], which Bridger would use to fly back to Atollon. Maul mocked Kenobi's lackluster living conditions, and wondered out loud whether it would be crueler to simply leave Kenobi to what Maul believed was a life of misery and squalor. But rather than responding with mockery in turn, as he might have in his younger years, Kenobi calmly and succinctly explained to Maul that because he defined himself by his empty desires to kill, possess, and dominate, the former Sith Lord had nothing at all. This infuriated Maul, who ignited one of the blades of his saberstaff and struck the ground in front of Kenobi's small campfire, showering it with sand and putting it out. Maul then began to speculate on his old nemesis's reasons for being on Tatooine, and quickly came to the conclusion that Kenobi was there to protect someone. Stirred to action by the threat of Maul to Luke, Kenobi ignited his lightsaber and assumed his traditional Soresu ready stance. As Maul tightened his grip on his own saber and ignited his second blade, Kenobi shifted his stance to the one used by his old master Qui-Gon during the duel on Naboo in the [[Theed power generator]].<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\n[[File:Maul_dies_but_for_real_this_time.png|thumb|right|240x240px|Maul dies in Kenobi's arms]]\nMaul noted Kenobi's change in stance and after a few tense moments, attacked. He crossed blades with Kenobi twice before attempting to hit him with the same hilt-strike that had allowed him to kill Qui-Gon. However, Kenobi had evidently anticipated this, and he struck down at Maul's hilt as Maul struck upwards, bisecting Maul's lightsaber and carving a lethal laceration into the former Sith Lord's chest. Maul dropped his ruined weapon and collapsed to one knee, but Kenobi caught him before he could fall to the ground and held him. As Maul laid dying, he asked Kenobi whether the person whom he was protecting was the Chosen One; the one prophesied to destroy the Sith. Kenobi, who at that point believed that Vader would never turn from the dark side, replied that he was. Maul appeared to take some modicum of comfort from this knowledge, seemingly certain that he and Kenobi would ultimately be avenged. Kenobi then traveled via dewback to the Lars' Homestead. Upon arriving there, he heard Beru Whitesun Lars calling to Luke and saw the teenager running back home against a binary sunset.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" />\n\nFollowing the former Sith's death,<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" /> Kenobi built a funeral pyre for Maul, honoring his old rival.<ref name=\"Time of Death\" />\n\n===Galactic Civil War===\n====Coming out of exile====\n{{Quote|We will need every advantage.''\"<br>\"''Your friend... the Jedi?''\"<br>\"''He served me well during the Clone Wars, but has lived in hiding since the Emperor's purge.

Shortly before the [[Battle of Scarif]], Kenobi's old friend Bail Organa, who, by this point, was a high-ranking leader within the Alliance, decided to recruit the exiled Jedi Master to their cause at [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]]'s urging.<ref name=\"Rogue One\">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> Unable to attend to it in person, Organa sent his daughter [[Prince]]ss Leia Organa to request Kenobi's help.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Barely escaping from the battle that had just taken place at [[Scarif]] after having recovered the [[Death Star plans|schematics]] for the Empire's planet-destroying [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]],<ref name=\"Rogue One\" /> she was captured in a [[Secret mission to Tatooine|battle]] over Tatooine. Leia transferred the plans into R2-D2's memory systems and sent the droid off to find Kenobi. This lead R2-D2 and C-3PO on a crusade that led them to be captured by a band of Jawas and being sold to Owen Lars and Luke Skywalker. However, R2-D2 ran off from the Lars homestead and off into the Jundland Wastes to try and find Kenobi. C-3PO, who was unaware of the mission given to R2-D2 by Princess Leia, encouraged Skywalker to go after the wayward astromech droid, but before they could return to the homestead, they were attacked by a group of Tusken Raiders. Kenobi showed up on the scene and scared the Tusken Raiders off by imitating the hunting cry of a krayt dragon.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nWith the Tuskens gone, Kenobi approached the unconscious Skywalker and checked that he was still alive before greeting R2-D2.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> However, Kenobi acted as though he did not know the droid for Luke's benefit.<ref name=\"ANH:TP,tS,atFB\">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> Restoring Skywalker to consciousness, the boy told him that R2-D2 was looking for someone named \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" to which Kenobi replied that was, in fact, his real name. To avoid more Tusken Raider attacks, Kenobi brought the two droids and the farm boy to his home. There, Kenobi revealed that he had known Skywalker's father, and that he'd been a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars, choosing to talk about him before his turn to the Dark Side. He then gave Skywalker his father's lightsaber, which he claimed that Anakin would have wanted Luke to have it. When Luke asked about how his father had died, Kenobi was careful not to tell him that Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader were one and the same; instead he twisted the truth, claiming that Vader, his former apprentice, had fallen to the dark side of the Force and helped the Empire hunt down and kill the Jedi, including Anakin. Though he wasn't technically lying to Luke - the man who Anakin Skywalker had been had died when he became Darth Vader - he wasn't being directly truthful either, and Luke would not learn the whole truth for another several years.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Leias_message.png|299x299px|thumb|right|Kenobi watches Leia's message.]]\nAfter this, Luke decided to show Kenobi the partial message from Leia Organa. The message finally played in its entirety, stating her father's request for him to aid the Alliance and that R2-D2 contained information vital to the survival of the Alliance. After the message concluded, Kenobi requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through and learn the ways of the Force, but Skywalker refused to get involved as he believed his duties at home were more important, but he offered to take Kenobi as far as [[Anchorhead]].<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nOn their way to the city, the two came across the skiff that had sold R2-D2 and C-3PO to Skywalker and his uncle; it had been destroyed and the Jawas had been killed. Initially believing it to be the casualty of another Tusken Raider attack, Kenobi correctly deduced that the attack was, in fact, the work of [[stormtrooper]]s who were searching for the droids. Worried that the stormtroopers may have gone after his aunt and uncle next, Skywalker headed back home despite Kenobi's claims that it was too dangerous. While Skywalker discovered that the Imperials had attacked the homestead and killed both Owen and Beru, Kenobi arranged a small funeral pyre for all the Jawas killed by the Empire's soldiers.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\nIt was at this time that Kenobi was met by the Force Ghost of Jinn. Kenobi's old master helped ease his anxieties about Luke, specifically his fear that Luke would suffer a tragic fate such as Anakin's. Qui-Gon marveled at how Obi-Wan had remained so steadfast and resilient after suffering through years of war and losing everyone he ever truly loved to a terrible end: Anakin, Satine, Padm\u00e9, and Jinn himself. Qui-Gon reassured Kenobi that he was making the right decisions with Luke. Sensing that Luke was returning from the remains of the Lars homestead, Qui-Gon bade his former student farewell and told him that they would see each other again, though kept to himself that Obi-Wan only had a short time to live.<ref name=\"Master and Apprentice\">{{Shortstory|story=Master and Apprentice (short story)|sformatted=Master and Apprentice|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> When Skywalker returned, the young man agreed to go with him to Alderaan and be trained as a Jedi.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n====Leaving Tatooine====\n{{Quote|If his ship is as fast as his boasting, we ought to do well.|Kenobi regarding Han Solo and the ''Millennium Falcon''.|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}\nThe four ventured out to Mos Eisley and to pay a visit to [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]]<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />&mdash;a place Kenobi had made rare visits to throughout his exile<ref name=\"theirkind\">{{Shortstory|story=We Don't Serve Their Kind Here|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>&mdash;in hopes of recruiting a pilot that could take them to Alderaan.

Skywalker was skeptical about the prospect of finding a pilot in the cantina, but Kenobi assured him that the best pilots could usually be found there, but warned him that the cantina could \"be a little rough.\" They ran into a small bout of trouble when a pair of wanted criminals, [[Cornelius Evazan]] and [[Ponda Baba]], began bullying Skywalker, but Kenobi was able to defuse the situation when he sliced off Baba's arm in defense of the young man.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> Although the patrons began to whisper of the lightsaber,<ref name=\"Born in the Storm\" /> Kenobi continued with his business of looking for transport.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:NoQuestionsAsked-AtG_Romana_Kendelic.png|thumb|left|250px|Kenobi barters with Han Solo for passage off Tatooine.]]\nKenobi soon met a Wookiee named [[Chewbacca]], who served as the first mate aboard a [[freighter]] known as the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', which was captained by a [[Corellia]]n [[smuggler]] named [[Han Solo]]. Solo boasted about his ship's speed to entice Kenobi. Though Solo's initial rate was 10,000 [[credit]]s all paid in advance, Kenobi was able to compromise: offering to pay 2,000 credits upfront, with an additional 15,000 when they got to Alderaan, for a total of 17,000 credits. Solo was convinced and agreed to take them to Alderaan. Kenobi and Skywalker then exited the cantina when they saw stormtroopers,<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> actually the very same troops Kenobi had mind tricked,<ref name=\"Born in the Storm\" /> who had entered to investigate the earlier disturbance caused when Baba lost his arm.

Soon enough, the ''Falcon'' exited hyperspace, and they discovered that the planet had been destroyed and replaced by an [[asteroid]] [[Asteroid field|field]]. As a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] approached them, Solo decided to shoot the small ship, but Skywalker noticed that the ship was coming from what, at first, seemed like a small moon - the Death Star.

Vader claimed to be the true master of the Force, but Kenobi instead claimed that he was only a \"master of evil.\" During the duel, Vader noted that his age had made him weak, but Kenobi told his former apprentice that he wouldn't win because he would become more powerful than Vader could ever imagine, even if he managed to kill him.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n[[File:Vaderstrike.png|thumb|222x222px|left|Kenobi is struck down by Darth Vader.]]\nThe two made their way to Bay 327 just as the team reunited to board the ''Falcon'', only for Kenobi to see the young Skywalker and give Vader a mysteriously knowing smile.

Yoda once again expressed doubts concerning Skywalker, still believing him to be too old, impatient and reckless, as much as he had anger in him like his father once had. However, Kenobi reminded Yoda that he had been once similar to Luke, back when Yoda taught him.<ref name=\"Episode V\" />\n\n=====Dagobah=====\nOver the weeks of Skywalker's training on Dagobah, Kenobi had needed to appear in six of Yoda's dreams to again and again convince him to continue the training, telling the old master that training the young Skywalker would be different from how Anakin's path had gone.

Finally, Kenobi gave Skywalker some final advice that he shouldn't give into his hate, for hate led to the dark side. As Skywalker departed from Dagobah, Kenobi was worried that the Jedi may have lost their last hope, only for Yoda to say there was another hope for the Jedi.<ref name=\"Episode V\" /> Though Yoda was speaking of Luke's sister, Leia Organa,<ref name=\"Episode VI\">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> a long but quiet moment passed between the two Jedi as Kenobi remembered the hope was not Anakin, with Kenobi still believing that his old friend was as dead as he was<ref name=\"There is Always Another\" /> and had been replaced by Vader.<ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\nAbout a year later, he reappeared after the death of Yoda to explain why he did not tell Luke the truth about his father.

He told Luke that he must face his destiny by confronting Vader once again.

However, throughout much of his early apprenticeship to Qui-Gon Jinn, Kenobi possessed strong fondness for rigid rules and a largely by-the-book attitude when it came to matters such as the Jedi Code. He felt as if he never truly understood his master and yet nevertheless wished to please him and earn his respect. He also had trouble understanding his master's hobbies and interests, such as study of arcane Jedi prophecies. The two later came to realization that Yoda intentionally placed Kenobi with a maverick master in the hope that he would rebel in the only way possible: by attempting to become a model Jedi.<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" />\n\nOver time, Kenobi would become loyal and dedicated to Jinn, possessing a dry sense of humor and sarcastic wit. Yoda said that he sensed Qui-Gon Jinn's defiance in him,<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> and Jinn himself reflected upon Kenobi's considerable knowledge and potential; he also considered his Padawan a lot wiser than he, if somewhat headstrong.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Although he could sometimes be impertinent,<ref name=\"There is Another\" /> he was often seen as wise beyond his years, his humble and soft-spoken demeanor belied his warrior prowess. Despite his numerous complaints during flight,<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> and deeply shaken by an experience involving [[autopursuit]] in his youth,<ref name=\"Master & Apprentice\" /> he was also a skilled pilot. In many ways, he represented the strength of the old Jedi Order: steadfast, selfless, and modest. His later skill at resolving disputes without a single battle would earn him the sobriquet \"The Negotiator,\" at least in the eyes of General Grievous.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\n[[File:RepublicJediArmor-Convergence.png|thumb|left|250px|Kenobi preferred negotiation before action, but was also an accomplished swordsman.]]\nOver time, Kenobi lost some of his youthful audacity and assumed the role of a more cautious and conservative mentor to Anakin Skywalker, who was in many ways his opposite in personality. Kenobi carefully measured his actions in any situation, garnering him the aforementioned nom de guerre. Kenobi was also known to be an accomplished storyteller. While hiding in the Jundland Wastes in his later years, he appeared as a kindly and eccentric old hermit (or, in Owen Lars' words, \"That wizard is just a crazy old man\") to those not familiar with the ways of the Jedi. In his final days, Kenobi retained his traits of patience and foresight as well as gaining some of the boldness reminiscent of his youth.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\nKenobi often thought out plans and strategies rather than leaping into action. He would usually place his hand on his chin or stroke his beard as he thought. This was a common trait of the Jedi Master, one that his apprentice Anakin Skywalker did not practice very often.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> He sometimes mentally repeated the Jedi Code to calm himself.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" /> He had also served as a mentor to Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. Tano recognized that Kenobi had more patience than Skywalker, but she also fondly remembered how they would bicker. She believed he would have enjoyed the strategy game [[crokin]].<ref name=\"Ahsoka\" />\n\nKenobi's respect for the lives of others led him to emerge from hiding to save Ezra Bridger and the [[C1-series astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] from succumbing to the deserts of Tatooine. Kenobi then reproved Ezra for succumbing to Maul's manipulation and counselled the young rebel to return to his place with the rebellion. Despite not hating Maul, Kenobi was prepared to fight and kill him in self defense. However, that caused him to get consumed a bit on the [[dark side]], as Maul was the culprit in the death of his friend and mentor Qui-Gon Jinn. After mortally wounding Maul, Kenobi comforted the former Sith and assured him that he was watching over the \"Chosen One,\" Luke Skywalker, though Luke was not the Chosen One by prophecy.<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" /> When he confronted Vader on the Death Star, Kenobi found himself unable to believe his foe was once his friend, even being unable to call him by his name; he used the title \"Darth\" instead, while he also realized his own anger was rising as Vader spoke.<ref name=\"Time of Death\" />\n\nKenobi was a [[human]]<ref name=\"Obi-Wan SWE\" /> [[Gender|male]] who stood at 1.82 [[meter]]s<ref name=\"Obi-Wan DB\" /> and weighed 81 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name=\"SWJB\" /> He had fair [[Color|skin]],<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /> gray-blue [[eye]]s, and auburn [[hair]]<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" /> which had turned white in his later years.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n===Romantic relationships===\n====Siri Tachi====\nA fellow Jedi, [[Siri Tachi]] trained at the Coruscant's [[Jedi temple|Temple]] at the same time as Kenobi. Back then, Tachi and Kenobi used to hold hands under the table during lunch despite attachments being forbidden for the Jedi.

The two Jedi and duchess lived on the run for over a year. Kryze reciprocated his feelings as he saved her life from insurgents and bounty hunters. When Kenobi's mission ended, he chose to honor his obligations to the Jedi Order in accordance to the Jedi Code. However, he regretted leaving the Duchess alone to rebuild Mandalore.<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\" />\n\n[[File:Memorial_Shrine_bombing.jpg|thumb|279x279px|Kenobi and Kryze's many hardships strengthened their bond.]]\nYears later during the Clone Wars,<ref name=\"The Mandalore Plot\" /> Kenobi and Kryze still had feelings for each other, but found themselves on opposing sides. Kryze had begun to advocate a course of neutrality for herself and 1,500 systems that wanted no part in the war, while Kenobi defended the use of military action to end the conflict with the Separatists, including a military presence on Mandalore to protect it from the Death Watch. As such, their inability to express their feelings led them to bicker relentlessly about their conflicting philosophies. Only when forced into action did their camaraderie return. When Kryze was taken hostage by Senator Merrick, she confessed that she had always loved him. Kenobi, despite the situation, confessed that he too loved her and would have left the Jedi Order if she asked it of him. Despite their confessions, Kenobi and Kryze continued with their responsibilities as peace keepers.<ref name=\"Voyage of Temptation\" />\n\nWhen Maul resurfaced on Mandalore, Kenobi attempted to rescue her from him but the pair were captured. Kenobi was forced to watch Maul choke Kryze and ultimately watch Maul kill her with the Darksaber.

Throughout his training years, he had learnt several forms of [[lightsaber combat]], especially [[Form III]].<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" /><ref name=\"Episode I\" /> In contrast to the aggressive dueling styles of his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker, Kenobi's combat style was mainly defensive, though he would use aggressive attacks when pressed. He faced some of the most dangerous people in the galaxy, such as the deadly Sith Lord Darth Maul and infamous Jedi Hunter General Grievous, respectively, the latter of whom he fought on at least seven occasions. Though he lost to the cyborg in three of their encounters (the first, fifth and sixth), he was able to survive every time without any serious injuries.\n\nKenobi was able to duel Grievous to a draw in their third and fourth encounters, and was able to overpower him in their second duel and ultimately killed him in the final round, albeit with a blaster rather than his lightsaber. However, his final victory may have been helped by Grievous' fresh injuries, which would have hampered the cyborg's fighting abilities.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Although Kenobi usually used only one lightsaber, he also seemed to have been well-versed in the art of [[Jar'Kai]], which was perhaps most prominently displayed during his duel with Darth Maul and Savage Opress, in which he wielded both his own lightsaber and the blade of the deceased [[Adi Gallia]]. His mastery of dual-blade combat allowed him to hold his own against both the Sith brothers, and he even managed to break Opress's left knee and sever his left arm. The duel ultimately ended as a stalemate when an angered Maul used his Force powers to briefly incapacitate Kenobi, giving the brothers time to escape.<ref name=\"Revival\" />\n\n[[File:KenobiVsVentress-TCWf.png|thumb|right|250px|Kenobi and Ventress engage in lightsaber combat]]\nKenobi also situationally, and somewhat less successfully, used Jar'Kai against General Grievous and Cad Bane respectively.<ref name=\"Hunt for Ziro\" /> He was also capable of using his lightsaber to ground Force lightning, as he demonstrated against Dooku on Geonosis. Kenobi was also able to defeat his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker, then Darth Vader, in an epic duel on Mustafar. Making use of his staunch Form III defense throughout the fight, Kenobi was eventually able to exploit Vader's aggressive nature, and dismembered the hate-filled Sith Lord when he recklessly jumped towards him.<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Decades later, he defeated his old nemesis Maul within seconds despite the former Sith Lord having demonstrated the ability to hold an advantage against three Inquisitors simultaneously,<ref name=\"Twin Suns\" /> and duel his former master Darth Sidious for a short time.<ref name=\"The Lawless\" />\n\nA few years later, during his rematch with Vader on the first Death Star, Kenobi proved formidable enough to hold his own against the Sith Lord for a short time. However, Vader's cautious but relentless assault ultimately overwhelmed Kenobi's defenses, and he was forced to begin retreating. Ultimately, he chose to become one with the Force rather than continue the fight and in doing this, he taught both of his Skywalker students one final lesson.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" />\n\n===Force powers===\n{{Quote|The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

He was trained in the use of the mind trick, making use of it whenever he wanted to avoid physical confrontations.<ref name=\"Episode II\" /><ref name=\"The Gungan General\" /><ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"SW7\" /> He was also able to use the Force to tame, control, and lead a group of angry gutkurrs on Ryloth.<ref name=\"Innocents of Ryloth\" /> As befitted a Jedi, Kenobi was adept at concealing his feelings in the Force when he chose to.<ref name=\"Dark Disciple\" />\n\nHe was also capable of using telekinesis to [[Force push|push]] or levitate objects,<ref name=\"SW7\" /> or to crush them, as seen when he destroyed two commando droids to recover his lightsaber after a difficult hand-to-hand fight with Darts D'Nar.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\" /> He would also use the Force to augment his natural leaping ability. His ability to use the Force push technique was exceptional, as he was able to use it to blast back General Grievous dozens of meters with a single push during their duel. A short time later, he was even able to hold off a Force blast from Anakin Skywalker during their duel, though after a short time the resulting telekinetic struggle launched both of them across a room.<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nPrior to his exile on Tatooine, Yoda instructed him on how to communicate his late master, Qui-Gon Jinn, who was unable to visibly manifest as a spirit due to his incomplete training under the [[Force Priestesses]].<ref name=\"Episode III\" /> Through Jinn, Kenobi eventually learned the ability to manifest his consciousness after death, a skill he would later put to good use to guide and counsel his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, during the Galactic Civil War.<ref name=\"Episode IV\" /><ref name=\"SW1\" /><ref name=\"Episode V\" /><ref name=\"Episode VI\" />\n\n===Other abilities===\n{{Quote|Obi-Wan is a great mentor; as wise as Master Yoda, and as powerful as Master Windu.|Anakin Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}\n[[File:General_Kenobi_CWCS.png|thumb|right|250px|General Kenobi destroying battle droids in his Jedi Commander Armor]]\nObi-Wan Kenobi proved himself to be a great military strategist and a highly studious man, demonstrating good knowledge on galactic history or conventions of war, like the [[Yavin Code]].<ref name=\"The Big Bang\" /> General Kenobi personally led his troops to many famous victories during the Clone Wars, and his persuasive demeanor earned him the moniker of \"The Negotiator.\"<ref name=\"Episode III\" />\n\nDespite his dislike of flying, Kenobi was an excellent pilot.
