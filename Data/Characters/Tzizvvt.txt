Claiming to be a professor of [[Archaeology/Legends|xenoarchaeology]] searching for a treasure known as \"[[The Eye of the Beyonder]]\", he was believed to be a fugitive from the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]] named '''Ilna'''. Setting up residence in [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine's]] sewers, Tzizvvt soon became a figure of derision on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]], dismissed as a \"crazy old storyteller.\" He had in fact collected some treasures, which he kept in his sewer-bound residence, but kept them secret from the proletarians.\n\nThe [[Lutrillian/Legends|Lutrillian]] war veteran [[Solomahal/Legends|Solomahal]] was one of the few who paid attention to Tzizvvt's stories told in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], and although he was not utterly convinced of the Brizzit's honesty, he was interested enough to inquire further. Impressed by Tzizvvt's collection, he agreed to help him search for his elusive treasure, even without up-front payment by the Brizzit.\n\n==Biography==\n===Tatooine===\nTzizvvt, a native of [[Jandoon]], was a member of the [[Brizzit]] [[Species/Legends|species]]. Despite the fact that [[Human/Legends|Humans]] found distinguishing different Brizzits difficult, Tzizvvt was listed on the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]] as \"Ilna\", a fugitive from Imperial justice who had stolen valuable relics from [[Biitu]] and [[Roon/Legends|Roon]].<ref name=\"db\" /> In an attempt to elude capture, he journeyed to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], where he hoped to find a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] who would ferry him to safety.<ref name=\"ccg\">{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Light/large/tzizvvt.gif|cardname=Tzizvvt}}</ref>\n\nSuspicious and fearful, Tzizvvt masqueraded as a [[Xenoarchaeology/Legends|xenoarchaeology]] professor, who sought an artifact known as [[The Eye of the Beyonder]]. [[File:SolomahalTzizvvt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tzizvvt and [[Atheloe]].]]Telling his story to those who would listen, he became a well known figure amongst the [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]] locals, and \"crazy old\" Tzizvvt soon earned the derision of the [[City/Legends|city's]] spacefaring populace. He took up residence in Tatooine's antiquated sewers, and filled his quarters with the stolen treasures from Biitu and Roon. He also kept a particularly spectacular piece, purported to have come from Jandoon itself.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n===Solomahal===\nIn [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], Tzivvt was present in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina/Legends|Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] when an elderly man entered the building with a younger man and a [[C-3PO/Legends|golden protocol droid]]. The younger man, [[Farmer/Legends|farmboy]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], got into an argument with the [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] thug [[Ponda Baba/Legends|Ponda Baba]], and the older [[Human/Legends|Human]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], interjected and used his [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's third lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] to slice off one of the Aqualish's [[Limb/Legends|arms]]. Although the spectacle initially grabbed everyone's attention, most went back to their conversations after several moments. The crowd then collectively turned to witness Kenobi depart the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]].<ref name=\"anh\">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> Eventually, word of Tzizvvt's tales reached the [[Ear/Legends|ears]] of [[Solomahal/Legends|Solomahal]], a veteran [[General/Legends|General]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. The Brizzit met the [[Lutrillian/Legends|Lutrillian]] in the cantina, where Tzizvvt spun his requisite tale about \"The Eye of the Beyonder.\" Solomahal was skeptical, and privately investigated the Brizzit's background. Despite his discovery of the Imperial warrant, he was still interested, and contacted Tzizvvt in his sewer residence. The Brizzit could not pay for Solomahal's services as a pilot up front, but the Lutrillian agreed to provide passage for him, in exchange for a cut of the treasures that would hypothetically be retrieved.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nAdept at spinning a tale and covering his identity, Tzizvvt was able to successfully evade Imperial reprisal for a [[Time/Legends|time]] leading up to the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. He developed an identity for himself in the Mos Eisley community, and was regarded as nothing more than a storyteller who was liberal with the truth. Some even went so far as to label him \"crazy.\" Nonetheless, he was eventually able to convince a pilot to aid him, even without the presentation of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] prior to service.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Brizzitmarvel.jpg|thumb|150px|The Brizzit shown in [[Star Wars (1977) 2|''Star Wars'' (1977) 2]].]]\n{{Quote|My entry had a very open ending and I liked that.
