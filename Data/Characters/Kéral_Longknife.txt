Although the T'Syri\u00e9l had traditionally been at war with the [[Human/Legends|Humans]] of the [[Calian Confederacy]], around [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]] Longknife signed the [[Concordat of Peace]] with Calian [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Aron Peacebringer]], ending generations of conflict. In doing so, Longknife and Peacebringer became [[blood brother]]s, and were at each others' sides during campaigns to come.<ref name=\"marvel53\" />\n\nIn [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Longknife joined Peacebringer and two of his Calian companions, [[Jain Havero]] and [[Ygal Delois]], to investigate the sudden severing of communications between the Calian [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Illyriaq\u00fcm]] and the [[City/Legends|city]] [[K'avor]]. Along the way, they rescued a young offworlder woman named [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], an important [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] leader who had crash-landed on Shiva IV, and was being menaced by T'Syri\u00e9l outcasts, and proceeded onward to find K'avor utterly destroyed in mysterious fashion.<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> Several weeks later, they learned the cause: an [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[General/Legends|General]] named [[Bentilais san Sk'ar]] had conspired with Delois to conquer the world and install Delois as its new ruler, and had tested a devastating [[anti-matter bomb]] on K'avor. As Peacebringer and Organa raced to prevent Sk'ar and Delois from unleashing another such weapon on Illyriaq\u00fcm, Longknife linked up with two of Organa's Rebel comrades, [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], who had tracked Organa to Shiva IV and arrived in the nick of time. Longknife and the Rebels provided reinforcement to Peacebringer as they battled the Imperials, ultimately foiling Sk'ar's plan and keeping Shiva IV free.<ref name=\"marvel54\">[[Star Wars (1977) 54|''Star Wars'' (1977) 54]]</ref>\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|I am ashamed, my brother.

However, Longknife took a dim view at times of his people's progression after the Concordat of Peace, lamenting their loss of bravery in battle.<ref name=\"marvel53\" /> However, his loyalty to his blood-brother was strong, and Longknife was quick to rush to Peacebringer's aid when the battle with the Imperials became dire.
