He was a [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] champion at the local [[Pazaak Den|pazaak den]] in the [[Refugee Sector]]. When former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Meetra Surik]] visited the pazaak den while searching Nar Shaddaa for [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], she managed to defeat every other player in the pazaak den at the game, forcing The Champ to make a grand entrance into the den and challenge Surik. Surik was able to beat The Champ at three consecutive pazaak matches and after the third one, The Champ admitted defeat and rewarded Surik with a rare tie-breaker pazaak card. The Champ would later assist in the rescue of Surik from the [[Exchange]] crime syndicate boss known as [[G0-T0|Goto]] by selling her [[Droid/Legends|droid]] companion, [[T3-M4]], to [[Vogga]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Quotetrans|Hello big stuff.

In a series of three consecutive games, each with a wager of {{Cr}}500, Surik was the winner in all three. The Champ admitted defeat and rewarded Surik with a rare tie-breaker pazaak card.

Goto had been capturing Vogga's [[Freighter/Legends|freighters]] before they could leave the [[Star system/Legends|system]] and being sold to the Hutt allowed T3 to obtain the transponder codes for Vogga's ships and use them on Surik's [[Starship/Legends|ship]], the ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', to ensure it was captured by Goto and allow her companions to launch a rescue attempt aboard the yacht.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n{{Endgame}}\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quotetrans|No more! Champ lose no more! Here, take this Golden Card and don't come back.|The Champ, after losing a third consecutive pazaak game to Meetra Surik|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords}}\nThe Champ was cocky and sure in his ability to play and win at the game of pazaak. Winning was all the fun he needed in playing pazaak, and he didn't understand when others asked why he played if he won all the time. He had a tendency to refer to any [[Species/Legends|species]] taller than his own as \"big stuff\" and had at least one admirer in the female [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] pazaak player named [[Dahnis]]. When Surik managed to beat him three times in a row, he told her to take his \"golden card\" and never come back. The Champ had [[Color/Legends|brown]] fur and black [[Eye/Legends|eyes]] and spoke the [[Chadra-Fan (language)/Legends|Chadra-Fan]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Pazaakden.png|thumb|right|250px|The Pazaak Den]]\nThe Champ appeared in the [[Video game|role playing video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]] for the [[Xbox]] in [[2004]] and the [[Personal computer|PC]] in [[2005]]. He only appears if the player manages to defeat the three pazaak players&mdash;[[Geredi]], [[Dahnis]], and [[S4-C8-GE3]]&mdash;in the pazaak den. Beating him at pazaak three times in a row rewards the player with a tie-breaker card, which allows the player to instantly win a tied pazaak game. The ''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' incorrectly classifies the Champ as a [[Snivvian/Legends|Snivvian]].\n\n===Alternate outcomes===\nPlayers with a high enough persuade skill or the [[Mind trick/Legends|Force persuade]] power can convince The Champ to lose on purpose. Using Force persuade results in [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points. If the player doesn't draw out The Champ by beating the rest of the pazaak players in the den, another Chadra-Fan, [[Kaalah-Nah]], will replace the Champ as the one selling T3 to Vogga. If the player doesn't draw out The Champ by beating the rest of the pazaak players in the den, and Kaalah-Nah dosn't talk to the player, the player can sell T3-M4 to [[Kodin]], an [[Aqualish/Legends|Aqualish]] who sells droid parts and is involved in a side quest. He then sells T3-M4 to Vogga.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Der Champ\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Champ, The}}\n[[Category:Chadra-Fan]]\n[[Category:Gamblers]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Unidentified males]]"}}}]}}}}
