A native of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Reynon]], Toth joined the [[Reynon resistance|resistance forces]] on his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] before joining the Alliance proper on the planet [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]]. There, he [[Marriage/Legends|married]] [[Tisha Rostek]], and the couple had a daughter, [[Samona]]; their happiness was short-lived, however, as Rostek was [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the [[Battle of Thovinack]]. One of the first Alliance Infiltrators, Toth led [[Scandium Team]], which participated in some of the most dangerous battles in the Alliance's early history.\n\nSometime prior to the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Scandium Team participated in a mission to the [[Wellte-ir system]]. Encountering elite [[Tank (vehicle)/Legends|Imperial armor]] units, the team received heavy casualties, with only six members surviving out of the twenty-one deployed. The incident became known as the [[Wellte-ir Massacre]]. Plagued by the memories of the massacre, Toth was forcibly retired from active combat, drawing a variety of assignments before being assigned to [[Delta Base]], the headquarters for the [[Suolriep sector/Legends|Suolriep sector]], where he served as a patrol [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and [[Advisor/Legends|advisor]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nHarovan Toth was a [[Reynonian]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Reynon]],<ref name=\"Scandium\" /> in the [[Albarrio sector/Legends|Albarrio sector]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]],<ref name=\"TEA-OC\">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-essential-atlas-online-companion|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Atlas'' Online Companion|int=Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion}}</ref> sometime between [[41 BBY/Legends|41 BBY]] and [[37 BBY/Legends|37 BBY]].<ref name=\"HT-age\" /> In [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]],<ref name=\"ERC\">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] declared himself [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]] and reorganized the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] into the first [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"RotS\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> A young man at the [[Time/Legends|time]], Toth joined the [[Reynon resistance|resistance movement]] against the Empire on his [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]], before being transferred off-planet to join the fledgling [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] at its [[Dantooine base/Legends|outpost]] on the planet [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]].<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\nSeveral [[Standard week/Legends|weeks]] after arriving on Dantooine, Toth met [[Tisha Rostek]], a civilian [[Advisor/Legends|advisor]]. The two fell in love and [[Marriage/Legends|married]], with their union producing a daughter, [[Samona]]. Toth began training as an [[Infiltrators/Legends|Infiltrator]] and, after a [[Standard year/Legends|year]], was one of the Rebellion's first fully-trained infiltration specialists. Despite fighting a [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|war]] against an enemy with overwhelming numbers, Toth was generally happy with his life. However, when Toth's daughter was eighteen [[Standard month/Legends|months]] old, his wife was [[Death/Legends|killed]] during the [[Battle of Thovinack]]. Toth sent Samona to live on the Alliance [[Safe world/Legends|safe world]] [[Isis]], where she was raised by [[Reynonian]] dissidents.<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\n===Scandium Team===\nAs the war against the Empire moved into full swing, Toth's involvement intensified, and he accepted command of one of the first Alliance infiltration [[Squad/Legends|squads]], [[Scandium Team]]. The [[Taloron]] [[Korgath]] served as Toth's first [[Officer/Legends|officer]], and the [[unit]] was broken down into small sub-units,<ref name=\"Scandium\" /> including [[Unit Theta]], led by the [[Jin]] [[Dutra Zeneta]];<ref name=\"Shroud\">{{Journal|10|Cracken's Rebel Operatives (article)|Cracken's Rebel Operatives}}</ref> [[Delta Unit]]; and [[Sandstorm Unit]], comprising the [[Ebranite]] sisters [[Rith Tar'ak]], [[Nyik]], and [[Tor'ara]].<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\nScandium Team participated in or planned some of the most dangerous missions ever undertaken by the Alliance. Their success rate was phenomenal, mostly due to the unit's tenacity and determination. However, the success rate was coupled to a high mortality rate for [[operative]]s. The unit was famed for surviving close encounters with Imperial forces, dealing with underworld figures, and general trouble-making.<ref name=\"Scandium\" /> Scandium Team participated in the [[Vidicx Campaign|Vidicx]] and [[Loac Campaign]]s,<ref name=\"Shroud\" /> as well as the [[Tynquay Skirmishes]], in which they rescued then-[[Major/Legends|Major]] [[Airen Cracken/Legends|Airen Cracken]]. During the [[Battle of Gendrah-Narvin]], Scandium Team's lead [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]], [[Jouffer Talamiin]], was permanently disabled. The [[Human/Legends|Human]] female [[Aven Cholus]] was selected to take her place and soon won Toth's respect. Scandium Team also [[Battle of Fendry|fought]] at the planet [[Fendry]]. Over the years, Scandium Team lost seven operatives, and several operations had not gone according to plan.<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\nToth commanded the unit for several years, achieving the [[Military rank/Legends|rank]] of [[Lieutenant Commander/Legends|Lieutenant Commander]] by the time of his twentieth mission, an operation to the [[Wellte-ir system]] in the [[Trax sector]]. On the plains of the planet [[Bresnan]], Scandium Team encountered two units of elite [[Tank (vehicle)/Legends|Imperial armor]], one of which was later suspected to comprise the [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Emperor's Royal Guard]] on field maneuvers. Outnumbered, Scandium Team fought a four-[[Standard day/Legends|day]] battle; of the twenty-one members deployed, fifteen were killed during the engagement. Pinned down on the [[Umber Banks]], Scandium Team was eventually extracted by Cholus, who had been delayed by numerous Imperial [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]].<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\nToth was forced to retire from active service after Wellte-ir, a situation he was willing to allow. The psychological scars of Scandium Team's last mission plagued Toth's memories, and the newly-promoted [[Commander/Legends|commander]] requested non-combat assignments from all his [[Commanding officer/Legends|commanding officers]]. He was posted at [[Great Temple/Legends|Yavin Base]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]], and, following the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]] during its assault on the Alliance base, Toth was posted to the temporary [[Thila/Legends|Thila]] [[Thila Command|Command Base]]. Afterward, Toth was assigned to [[Delta Base]], the [[Suolriep sector/Legends|Suolriep sector]] headquarters, on [[New Kisge]]. He served as a patrol pilot, content to police the jungle moon, and also occasionally served as an advisor. However, Toth made it clear that he had no intentions of ever returning to active combat duty.<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\nToth's leadership and organization of Scandium Team was instrumental in assisting [[General/Legends|General]] [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]] in formally organizing the [[Alliance Special Forces/Legends|Alliance Special Forces]]. [[Delta Team]], the next prominent SpecForce team after Scandium, was named in honor of Scandium's Delta Unit.<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nHarovan Toth was considered to be the ideal [[Alliance Intelligence|intelligence]] operative; he was totally nondescript and was of average height, weight, and build. He had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] that had started to thin sometime after the Battle of Yavin and green [[Eye/Legends|eyes]]. His combat service had left him with extensive scarring across his body. Formerly a happy man, the death of his wife and the traumatic experiences in the Wellte-ir system changed Toth into a bitter individual plagued by traumatic memories. Toth did find contentment during his assignment to Delta Base, where he enjoyed his duties and was in regular contact with his daughter, who had since begun to serve the Alliance as a pilot, holding the rank of [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]].<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nA highly-skilled Infiltrator, Harovan Toth was trained to use [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] and was proficient in both [[Melee weapon/Legends|melee]] and [[unarmed combat]]. He was especially skilled with a [[vibroknife]] and was adept at using [[ascian dagger]]s as thrown weapons. Toth was trained in stealth disciplines and was perfectly capable of commanding a unit of twenty-eight individuals in combat. He specialized in urban survival techniques and was knowledgeable about [[Alien/Legends|alien]] [[Species/Legends|species]] and their [[Language/Legends|languages]]. The inner workings of a [[Bureaucrat/Legends|bureaucracy]] were known to Toth, and he was aware of [[Law enforcement agency/Legends|law enforcement]] policies and procedures, especially ones pertaining to Imperial law.<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\nA skilled pilot, Toth was able to fly both [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ships]] and space [[Transport/Legends|transports]], and could [[Astrogation/Legends|plot courses]] through [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]. He could also operate [[Comm unit/Legends|communications]] systems and [[Sensor/Legends|sensors]]. On the ground, Toth was able to ride domesticated animals, preferring [[Cracian thumper]]s, and fly [[Repulsorlift/Legends|repulsorlift]] craft, with a specialty in [[T-47 airspeeder/Legends|T-47 airspeeders]]. He could also pilot [[Walker/Legends|walkers]] and was skilled in driving [[All Terrain Scout Transport/Legends|All Terrain Scout Transports]]. Technically adept, Toth was able to [[Programmer/Legends|program]] and repair [[Computer/Legends|computers]], program [[Droid/Legends|droids]], repair repulsorlift vehicles, and circumvent security systems. He was also skilled in demolitions and trained in first aid, with a particular skill in treating Talorons. As part of Scandium Team's missions involved dealing with the seedier elements of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], Toth had underworld contacts and was a skilled forger.<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nBy the time of Harovan Toth's posting to Delta Base, he generally wore a [[Flight suit/Legends|flight suit]] and carried a [[Comlink/Legends|comlink]] and a [[Hunting blaster/Legends|hunting blaster]].<ref name=\"Scandium\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nHarovan Toth first appeared in the [[Star Wars Adventure Journal 11|eleventh issue]] of the ''[[Star Wars Adventure Journal]]'', published in [[1996]] by [[West End Games]]. He was featured in the article series \"[[Cracken's Rebel Operatives (article)|Cracken's Rebel Operatives]],\" which was written by [[Craig Robert Carey|C. Robert Carey]] and [[Trevor J. Wilson]].
