When she attacks, the player will have to kill her in order to get the parts, as one cannot interact with objects while in combat mode. However, since it is possible to sneak around her and retrieve the parts unnoticed, her death or survival is not canonically established.<ref name=\"SWG:RM\" />\n\nAccording to the game's directory .tree files and reference manuals, this character was originally named '''Daezii Mae'''.<ref name=\"SWG:RM\" /><ref name=\"SWG:POGG\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|Starter Kit}} {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide]]'' {{ID|Daezii Mae}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWGWiki|Repo Man}}\n\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
