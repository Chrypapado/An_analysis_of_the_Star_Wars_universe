His past was full of devoted service to the [[Chief Councilor]]. He had a perfect memory, likened to a [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid's]] ability to retain information. He was present when [[Tolokai]], her [[Gotal/Legends|Gotal]] bodyguard, attacked her under the influence of the brainwashing of [[Warlord/Legends|Warlord]] [[Zsinj]]'s [[Project Funeral]]. Malan fell with a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]] to his chest, but succeeded in forcing Tolokai down the stairs in a [[Death/Legends|fatal]] fall that broke the assailant's neck.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[X-Wing: Solo Command]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The New Essential Guide to Characters]]''\n*{{FFCite|108|MOT7, ''Mon Mothma''}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Malan Tugrina\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tugrina, Malan}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:New Republic individuals]]"}}}]}}}}
