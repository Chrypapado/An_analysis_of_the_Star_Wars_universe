He lived in the [[Refugee Sector]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], during the last days of the [[Dark Wars]] in [[3951 BBY]]. During this [[Time/Legends|time]], he became gravely ill with an ailment that the other refugees referred to as a contagious [[plague]]. While visiting the moon, the former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Meetra Surik]] used her medical skills to heal Geriel of his illness. Geriel was immensely grateful and rewarded Surik with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] component.\n\n==Biography==\nGeriel was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] who lived in the [[Refugee Sector]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]],<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /> during the final stages of the [[Dark Wars]] in [[3951 BBY]].<ref name=\"CAMP\">''[[Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide]]''</ref> He came to the moon as a refugee from the [[Mandalorian Wars|Mandalorian]] and the [[Jedi Civil War]]s.<ref name=\"CSWE\">{{CSWECite|I|335|Geriel}}</ref> During this [[Time/Legends|time]], he began suffering from an illness. The other refugees insisted that he had contracted some kind of contagious [[plague]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\nDuring her visit to the moon in search of [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Zez-Kai Ell]], [[Meetra Surik]], a former [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]], spoke with Geriel. He begged her to stay away from him, as he did not want to infect anyone else with his grave illness. He told Surik that he did not know how he became sick, but that he had felt just fine the day before. Surik could almost immediately tell that his condition was not serious and used her medical knowledge to cure his sickness. Geriel was overjoyed to be feeling better and rewarded Surik with a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] part. Surik used Geriel's illness to convince the [[Exchange]] criminal organization overseer of the sector, [[Saquesh]], to ease up on the refugees.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" /><ref name=\"CSWE\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\nGeriel had [[Color/Legends|red]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]], green [[Eye/Legends|eyes]], and light skin. He sported a beard.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Equipment==\nThe Human wore beige [[Clothing/Legends|clothing]].<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nGeriel appears in the [[2004]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''. The reward the player receives for helping Geriel is a random lightsaber upgrade item. The player can alternatively convince Geriel to [[Suicide/Legends|kill himself]], resulting in the player receiving [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] points. Additionally, the player can tell [[Saquesh]], the [[Exchange]] crime organization's overseer of the Refugee Sector, that Geriel's illness is contagious, which Saquesh will answer by having him [[Death/Legends|killed]]. This also results in dark side points. The player can also use Geriel's illness to convince Saquesh to ease his pressure on the refugees, under the condition that the player deals with Geriel's sickness by himself or herself.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]'' states that the Exile used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to heal Geriel,<ref name=\"CSWE\" /> while the game depicts the Exile using the \"Treat Injury\" skill, as in medicine.<ref name=\"KOTOR2\" />\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' {{1st}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Geriel\n}}\n\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Nar Shaddaa residents]]\n[[Category:Refugees]]"}}}]}}}}
