She was [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the ''[[Tryst]]''. Under the command of the ''[[Tradewyn]]'' she received Raynar with his friends aboard the ''[[Shadow Chaser]]'' and the ''[[Rock Dragon]]'' in [[24 ABY/Legends|24 ABY]]. Raynar had returned from his [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] education of [[Yavin 4/Legends|Yavin 4]] to travel to his mother [[Aryn Dro Thul]] on the ''Tradewyn''. When he met only Dro and the ''Tryst'', he became distrustful. To make sure that she was really related to him, he asked her which of their family treasures had survived the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]]. She answered confidently and properly that it was the [[Dro ceremonial fountain]]. After that he and his companions traveled with her to rendezvous with the [[Bornaryn Trading Fleet]].\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance]]'' {{1st}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Dro Prack\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prack, Dro}}\n[[Category:Alderaanians]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Humans]]"}}}]}}}}
