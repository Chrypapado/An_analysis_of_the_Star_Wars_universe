Fortunately for him, he encountered a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] willing to help him during his stay in [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]]. Seeing [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] as his greatest obstacle, Ungasan wished to forge an alliance with [[Lord/Legends|Lady]] [[Valarian/Legends|Valarian]], a powerful enemy of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire/Legends|Jabba's empire]]. The spacer agreed, and was sent to deliver a [[Datacard/Legends|datadisc]] to Triddle \"Flip\" Flipinigan, containing a proposal for Ungasan to ally with Valarian.<ref name=\"SWG\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:TemplateValarianEnforcer.jpg|250px|thumb|Every possible depiction of Triddle \"Flip\" Flipinigan]]\n\nTriddle \"Flip\" Flipinigan was a [[Wikipedia:Non-player character|Non-Player Character]] (NPC) in the [[Wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' prior to its closure on [[December 15]], 2011. Players who performed a series of quests for Ungasan in Mos Espa had to deliver a datadisc to Flipinigan outside the [[City/Legends|city]].\n\nDue to the nature of many older quests in ''Star Wars Galaxies'', the gender, species, and appearance of Flipinigan changed each time a player performed this quest. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the canonical gender and species of Flipinigan.\n\n==Appearances==\n*{{SWG|An Empire Divided}} {{1st}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flipinigan, Triddle}}\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified gender]]\n[[Category:Individuals of unspecified species]]\n[[Category:Tatooinians]]"}}}]}}}}
