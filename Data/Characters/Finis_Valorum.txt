He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are in charge now.|Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Sheev Palpatine|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}\n'''Finis Valorum''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|male]] [[Politics|politician]] from [[House Valorum]] who served as the penultimate [[Supreme Chancellor]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. His administration was hampered by corruption and bureaucracy in the [[Galactic Senate]], which Valorum was unable to bring under control.\n\nTowards the end of his administration, Valorum attempted to resolve the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[Invasion of Naboo]] to little effect. As a result of government inaction, [[Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] called for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Valorum's leadership. The Senate scheduled an election for a new Chancellor, and Valorum was replaced by [[Senator]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] of Naboo; Palpatine was secretly Darth Sidious, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]], and had orchestrated the Naboo Crisis to become Supreme Chancellor and, ultimately, transform the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]].\n\nDuring the [[Clone Wars]], over ten [[Standard year|years]] after his political downfall, Valorum assisted the [[Jedi Order]] as they investigated the circumstances surrounding the [[death]] of [[Jedi Master]] [[Sifo-Dyas]], who, as Chancellor, Valorum had sent on a [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre\u2013Naboo Crisis)|mission]] to resolve a dispute with the [[spice]] dealers known as the [[Pyke Syndicate]]. The Jedi learned Sifo-Dyas had been killed by the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of the [[Sith]]&mdash;who wanted to control the [[Grand Army of the Republic|clone army]] Sifo-Dyas had secretly commissioned for the Republic&mdash;during the mission that Valorum had sent him on. After the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the Empire, some Coruscanti continued to have fond memories of the former Supreme Chancellor.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career and chancellery===\n{{Quote|Valorum didn't ''win'' the election; he was merely ''allowed'' to win.

Along with the Chancellor, [[Senator]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] of [[Naboo]], and other dignitaries, Valorum attended the commencement and commissioning ceremonies at the [[Sullust Sector Spacefarers Academy]], a [[pilot]]ing academy on [[Sullust]]. Later, Valorum himself was elected to the chancellery by the [[Galactic Senate]].<ref name=\"Tarkin\" /> During his administration, his political power became hampered by the massive bureaucracies of the government,<ref name=\"Databank\" /> and he became mired in accusations of corrupt conduct.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:Sifo-Dyas_holo.png|thumb|left|250px|Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas investigated the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum.]]\nPalpatine believed that Valorum did not care about the [[Coruscant Underworld|lower levels]] of Coruscant, beneath its surface, and suggested Valorum was happy to pretend they did not exist.<ref name=\"Obi-Wan Anakin 2\">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 2|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 2]]</ref> At some point during Valorum's chancellorship, however, there was a crisis in the [[Pyke Syndicate]], a criminal organization that dealt [[spice]], that could have resulted in a full-scale crime war beneath Coruscant's surface. In order to stabilize the Pykes, who held almost complete control over raw spice used to create a drug, Chancellor Valorum contacted [[Jedi Master]] [[Sifo-Dyas]], a [[Jedi]] who had experience with the criminal underworld. Valorum did not, however, inform the [[Jedi High Council]] that he was [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre\u2013Naboo Crisis)|sending]] Sifo-Dyas or the Chancellor's personal aide, [[Silman]], to the Pyke [[planet]] of [[Oba Diah]]; the Senate feared that holding open discussions with the Pykes could legitimize their criminal activities and offer opposition leaders in the bureaucracy an opportunity to take down Valorum's administration.<ref name=\"The Lost One\">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>\n\nAfter arriving on Oba Diah, Sifo-Dyas was diverted to [[Felucia]] by the Jedi Council, who ordered him to deal with a conflict between Felucian tribes. As the Jedi Master and Silman were leaving the Pyke world, the Pykes&mdash;who had been hired by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] [[Dooku|Tyranus]]&mdash;shot [[Jedi T-6 shuttle 775519|Sifo-Dyas' ship]] down, [[Death|killing]] the Jedi Master and taking Silman as a [[prisoner]]. Valorum and the Jedi were left believing that Sifo-Dyas and Silman had been killed on Felucia.<ref name=\"The Lost One\" />\n\nAt some point before the [[Invasion of Naboo]], Valorum [[Mission to Oosalon|dispatched]] Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] to [[Oosalon]] so he could free several kidnapped Jedi [[Padawan]]s from [[Guattako]] the Grim and end Guattako's threat once and for all, as the fearless [[warlord]] was planning to still kidnap [[Youngling|children]] to recruit them into his [[Guattako's army|child]] [[army]].<ref name=\"Age of Republic\">{{Shortstory|story=The Weapon|book=Age of Republic Special 1}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his chancellery, and against political expectations, Valorum was elected to a second term. According to Palpatine, who presented himself as an ally but&mdash;as Darth Sidious, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]] of the [[Sith]]&mdash;secretly plotted Valorum's downfall, Valorum was allowed to win by special interest groups who exploited legal loopholes, such as in Republic free trade laws, and needed a Chancellor who would become entangled in the governmental bureaucracies. Despite his reelection, citizens on Coruscant began placing bets on whether Valorum would be able to serve a full term. It was at that time that Palpatine's name was whispered as a potential successor. Valorum's chancellery was furthered hampered when he attempted to investigate the events of a disastrous [[Eriadu Conference|trade summit]] on [[Eriadu]], but was stonewalled by Eriadu's [[Governor|planetary governor]], [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], at the request of Senator Palpatine. Tarkin himself had been elected governor on Eriadu despite opposition from House Valorum, further weakening the Chancellor's position.<ref name=\"Tarkin\" />\n\nIn the final [[Standard month|months]] of Valorum's chancellery, work began on the millennial celebrations intended to mark the thousand-[[Standard year|year]] anniversary of the foundation of the Galactic Republic, which followed the [[Jedi-Sith War|last war]] between the Jedi and the Sith. Valorum and his team spent time exploring logo designs and artwork to commemorate the event, and the chancellor himself was intimately involved in the design process. Valorum rejected 250 different revisions for a [[Millennial Celebration Invitation|millennial invitation]] for a variety of reasons&mdash;such as the warmth of the design as well as its exclusivity&mdash;out of concern for his declining public image. He ultimately delegated the responsibility for the design to Senator Palpatine, who finalized a design that featured [[Sistros Nevet]], the ancient lawmaker who helped create the original constitution of the Republic after the fall of the Sith. The concept and layout were created by the [[artist]] [[Naveela Betuine]], while the final execution was done by [[Dashira Dobeq]].<ref name=\"Propaganda\">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref>\n\n===Political downfall===\n{{Quote|If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed.

The negotiations did not take place, however, as the Federation [[Escape from the Saak'ak|attempted]] to kill the two Jedi. Shortly thereafter, the Federation launched the Invasion of Naboo. [[Queen]] [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] of Naboo was able to escape the planet with the help of the Jedi, and she traveled to Coruscant in order to seek the help of Chancellor Valorum and the Senate. Valorum was present when she arrived and called for a special session of the Senate so Amidala could plead her case.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n[[File:ZodKneelsBeforeAmidala-TPMHD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Valorum was left stunned that Amidala called for a Vote of No Confidence against him.]]\nThe Senate session, which Valorum presided over, proved unproductive for Amidala's cause. Senator Palpatine and Queen Amidala proclaimed that the Federation had invaded Naboo, a claim that [[Lott Dod]], the Senator from the Trade Federation, disputed on the basis that no proof had been provided. Dod recommended to the Chancellor that the Senate appoint a commission to study the allegations, a recommendation that was seconded by the representatives of the planet [[Malastare]]. Valorum consulted with his advisors, including [[Vice Chair]] [[Mas Amedda]], and ultimately asked Amidala whether she would accept a commission. Amidala refused and, at Palpatine's urging, called for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Valorum's leadership.<ref name=\"Episode I\" /> Unknown to Valorum was that Amedda was secretly working for Palpatine, and he knew that Valorum's indecision would make him look weak and present an opportunity to oust him from office.<ref name=\"Character Encyclopedia\" />\n\nAmidala's motion led to Valorum's removal from office. A new election was called to replace him, and led to the nominations of Senator Palpatine, [[Bail Antilles]] of [[Alderaan]], and [[Ainlee Teem]] of Malastare. As Palpatine had predicted, the Invasion of Naboo created a sympathy vote in the Senate, and he was elected Supreme Chancellor in Valorum's place. Due to Valorum and the Senate's inability to act, Queen Amidala also returned to her planet and, with the help of the Jedi that Valorum had first sent to Naboo, ended the invasion.<ref name=\"Episode I\" />\n\n===Post-chancellorship and legacy===\n{{Quote|It's been a long time, my friend.|Finis Valorum, to Yoda, during the Clone Wars|The Lost One}}\nValorum's political fall and the liberation of Naboo led to changes within the shipping conglomerates.
