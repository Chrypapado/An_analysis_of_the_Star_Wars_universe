The informal name for the group comes from their second major goal- for Onderon to secede from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]], which it had been a part of for only fifty years, and return to independence.\n\nThe separatists saw their chance to fulfill their goals when General Vaklu pronounced Queen Talia guilty of treason, starting the Onderon Civil War. They were defeated at the [[Second Battle of Onderon (Onderon Civil War)|Second Battle of Onderon]] by the [[Onderon Royalist]]s, commanded by [[Meetra Surik]] and supported by the Galactic Republic and the [[Mandalorians (Clan Ordo)|Mandalorians]].\n\n==Separatist classes==\n*[[Vaklu officer]]\n*Vaklu heavy soldier\n*Vaklu soldier\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nIf Meetra Surik chooses to support the separatists, they win the Onderon Civil War and fulfill their goal of overthrowing Talia and seceding from the Republic.\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*''[[The Essential Atlas]]'' <!-- p. 89 -->\n\n{{Interlang\n|pl=Separaty\u015bci Onderonu\n|ru=\u041e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b\n}}\n\n[[Category:Onderonians]]\n[[Category:Political factions]]\n[[Category:Resistance groups]]"}}}]}}}}
