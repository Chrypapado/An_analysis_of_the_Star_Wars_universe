Surrender to me now or be destroyed.|Baron Merillion Tarko|Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II}}\n'''Merillion Tarko''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] [[Baron/Legends|baron]] hailing from the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] of [[Anaxes/Legends|Anaxes]]. Coming from a family that possessed ties to the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] government and [[Republic Military/Legends|military]], he attended the [[Anaxes Citadel]], from which he graduated with the highest honors. When the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] broke out between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Tarko was quickly assigned to a Republic [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]]. By the conclusion of the war and the birth of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], he had embarked on a fast rise to positions of power.\n\nWith the assistance of [[Governor/Legends|Governor]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin/Legends|Wilhuff Tarkin]], Tarko ascended to the rank of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] and assumed control of Imperial operations on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cato Neimoidia/Legends|Cato Neimoidia]]. He established his headquarters in the [[Cato Neimoidian bridge city|bridge city]] of [[Tarko-se/Legends|Tarko-se]], which he had renamed after himself. The Baron profited greatly from his ventures on the [[Neimoidian/Legends|Neimoidian]] [[purse world]], which included the operation of [[Casino/Legends|casinos]] and the management of a successful [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] trade. Using his new-found wealth, Tarko constructed a for-sport-and-profit [[Tarko-se Arena|gladiatorial arena]] on Cato Neimoidia.\n\nThe [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] eventually learned of the Baron's slaving activities, and [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] [[Rahm Kota]] launched an unsanctioned [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] attempt on Tarko during a Rebel reconnaissance of Cato Neimoidia. Kota was captured during the [[Raid on Cato Neimoidia|mission]] and forced to compete for seven straight days in the [[Gladiator/Legends|gladiatorial]] stadium. Word of Kota's capture eventually reached [[Subject 1138|Starkiller]], a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] of the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] former [[Galen Marek|apprentice]] who had fought alongside Kota. Starkiller traveled to Cato Neimoidia to rescue the [[General/Legends|General]], confronting Tarko in the process and defeating the majority of his forces spread throughout Tarko-se. As a last-ditch effort, Tarko released the massive [[Gorog (creature)|Gorog]] to deal with both [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], but the plan backfired when the Gorog broke free from the arena and devoured the Baron.\n\n==Biography==\n===Rise to power===\nBorn on the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core World]] of [[Anaxes/Legends|Anaxes]], the [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] Merillion Tarko hailed from a lineage with ties to both the [[Republic Military/Legends|military]] and government of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. A [[Baron/Legends|baron]], Tarko attended the [[Anaxes Citadel]],<ref name=\"Website\" /> a massive government complex on Anaxes that housed, among other things, training schools.<ref name=\"CCW\">''[[Coruscant and the Core Worlds]]''</ref> He graduated from the Citadel with top honors. The timing of his graduation coincided with the start of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]<ref name=\"Website\" /> in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], which pitted the Republic against the breakaway [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name=\"AOTC\">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Tarko was assigned to one of the Republic's [[Flagship/Legends|flagships]] immediately after the war's outbreak.<ref name=\"Website\" /> The war ended three [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later, in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]]; simultaneously, [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] [[Declaration of a New Order|reorganized]] the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"ROTS\">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Tarko embarked on a meteoric rise to power in the wake of the Empire's formation.

Over [[Time/Legends|time]], he even came to speak [[Galactic Basic Standard/Legends|Basic]] with a Neimoidian accent.<ref name=\"Game\">''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]''</ref>\n\nIn his position as overseer of the Imperial outpost on Cato Neimoidia, Tarko operated a successful [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] trade. The Baron's business venture provided the Empire a source of manual labor to be utilized in the construction of facilities on worlds occupied by Imperial forces.<ref name=\"Website\" /> Tarko gave the best of his stock to high-paying Imperial [[Officer/Legends|officers]], selling the remainder to criminal elements, such as the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]].<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> Tarko also opened [[Casino/Legends|casinos]] on-planet and used the wealth they generated to erect a [[Tarko-se Arena|gladiatorial arena]] that played host to combat matches for profit in addition to sport.<ref name=\"Website\" /> At the stadium's dedication, the Baron spoke about Cato Neimoidia's \"delicate transition\" to a protectorate of the Empire, knowing that the population had many concerns with the Empire's handling of the situation. He made it clear that violence against Imperial forces was inexcusable, before announcing that several insurrectionists would be participating in the arena's opening matches.<ref name=\"Databank\" />\n\nTarko's activities eventually drew the attention of the fledgling [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], which gathered data on the Baron's activities and the strength of his headquarters's defenses&mdash;intelligence that ultimately proved to be inaccurate. In [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]], the Alliance [[Raid on Cato Neimoidia|dispatched]] [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Juno Eclipse]] and the crew of the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate/Legends|Nebulon-B frigate]] [[Salvation (Nebulon-B)|''Salvation'']] to Cato Neimoidia to observe Tarko's defenses in action, a mission that coincided with an [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]] attempt on the Baron led by [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] [[Rahm Kota]] and his [[Kota's squad|commando squad]]. The Baron's forces proved to be too much to handle for the Rebels, who had not expected heavy resistance. After a brief engagement, the ''Salvation'' was compelled to retreat when Imperial reinforcements arrived, and Kota&mdash;the only survivor of his [[Squad/Legends|squad]]&mdash;was captured. Tarko, observing from a skybox, forced Kota to compete against various beings and creatures within the [[Gladiator/Legends|gladiatorial]] arena, but the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] continually managed to best his opponents for seven days straight.<ref name=\"TFUII\" />\n\n====Starkiller's arrival====\n{{Quote|I don't know who you are, but you clearly have no idea who you are dealing with.|Tarko, to Starkiller|Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II}}\n[[File:Tarko_squad.png|thumb|right|250px|Tarko and a stormtrooper contingent point blasters at the newly-arrived Starkiller.]]\nWord of Kota's capture eventually reached the [[Timira City|cloning facilities]] of [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]], where the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] was finalizing the training of his [[Cloning/Legends|cloned]] [[Sith apprentice/Legends|apprentice]], [[Subject 1138|Starkiller]]. Starkiller, however, rebelled against Vader and [[Escape from Kamino (1 BBY)|fled]] Kamino in the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] [[Lord/Legends|Lord's]] personal [[Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1|TIE fighter]], journeying to Cato Neimoidia to rescue Kota. Upon the [[Starship/Legends|craft's]] arrival at Tarko-se, a [[Unidentified Neimoidian aide 2|Neimoidian aide]] to the Baron assumed that Vader was [[Pilot/Legends|piloting]] the [[TIE Series|TIE]] [[Starfighter/Legends|fighter]] and informed the Baron that the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] had arrived. Tarko and a contingent of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] traveled to the landing platform, intending to greet Vader, only to find that the visitor was not the Dark Lord. Starkiller questioned Tarko on Kota's location, but the Baron revealed little information, instead asking the man to recite the [[Sector/Legends|sector's]] security clearance codes as he slowly gripped his [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]]. When Starkiller failed to do so, Tarko and his men opened fire; the Baron soon fled after Starkiller cut down many of the [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]].<ref name=\"Game\" />\n\nAs the apprentice tore through the Imperial forces scattered about the city, the Baron observed Starkiller's progress from safety, occasionally using a public address system to threaten and taunt the intruder. Tarko became impressed with Starkiller's skill; he wondered how the apprentice would fare in the gladiatorial arena and even offered the man a life of luxury if he competed in the stadium. Having defeated everything that the Baron threw at him, Starkiller arrived at the stadium and relieved Kota of his arduous seven-day-long match. Enraged, Tarko ordered that the massive [[Gorog (creature)|Gorog]] be released to deal with the two individuals; a [[Unidentified Neimoidian aide 1|Neimoidian aide's]] protest about the creature's untested restraints fell on deaf [[Ear/Legends|ears]].<ref name=\"Game\" />\n\n[[File:The_Gorog_vs_Baron_Tarko.png|thumb|left|250x250px|Tarko's last mistake ends in his demise when the Gorog devours him.]]\nStarkiller managed to momentarily defeat the Gorog, destroying the arena's supports and sending both it and the creature into the sinkhole below as Kota confronted the Baron within his private skybox.<ref name=\"Game\" /> The [[General/Legends|General]] slew Tarko's Neimoidian [[Aide/Legends|aides]]<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> and, with help from Starkiller, defeated the Baron's stormtrooper guards.<ref name=\"Game\" /> Before either could kill Tarko, the Gorog grabbed hold of the skybox to arrest his fall. The impact caught all three combatants off guard, throwing Tarko to the floor and dislodging his throne from its restraints. As the throne slid toward the skybox's shattered [[Window/Legends|window]], it caught the Baron, dragging him out of the chamber with it. Tarko tried to save himself from certain [[Death/Legends|death]], to no avail. Screaming in fear, the Moff became the Gorog's last meal as he fell into the beast's open mouth.<ref name=\"TFUII\" />\n\n==Personality and traits==\n{{Quote|Troopers' lives are cheap, but that Neimoidian architecture is expensive.|Tarko|Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II}}\n[[File:TarkoAndNeimoidianAide-TFU2.png|thumb|right|250px|As the potentate of Cato Neimoidia, Tarko adopted many aspects of Neimoidian culture.]]\nIn his position as the potentate of Cato Neimoidia, Moff Tarko believed that he possessed an aura of authority.<ref name=\"TFUII\" /> Over time, the Baron adopted Neimoidian culture as his own; he began dressing like the world's inhabitants and even spoke Basic with a slight, yet noticeable, Neimoidian accent.<ref name=\"Game\" /> Tarko, in return, left his own mark on Cato Neimoidia&mdash;he renamed a captured bridge city in his own honor.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> He valued the city's architecture more than he valued the lives of the stormtroopers defending it.<ref name=\"Game\" />\n\nTarko profited greatly from his business ventures on Cato Neimoidia; the operation of casinos and a slave trade gave the Baron a decent on-the-side line of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credit]] that funded his massive gladiatorial arena.<ref name=\"Website\" /> Tarko used the arena to eliminate dissenters to Imperial rule, allowing them to fight only with their preferred weapon of sedition&mdash;their words.<ref name=\"Databank\" /> The Moff was capable of defending himself when needed; Tarko carried a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster pistol]] for protection and occasionally fought alongside stormtroopers in combat, though the Baron would flee when the odds were against him.<ref name=\"Game\" />\n\nUpon Starkiller's arrival in Tarko-se, Tarko was initially impressed with the cloned apprentice's skills, although he became angered when Starkiller ignored his offers to end their hostilities and continued to cut through the city's defenses en route to the gladiatorial stadium. Tarko's rage reached a fatal apex when he ordered the Gorog to be released to deal with the intruder, ignoring a frightened Neimoidian aide's concerns that the arena might not be able to properly restrain the beast. Starkiller defeated the creature, but not before the Gorog made a last meal out of the Baron.<ref name=\"Game\" />\n\n==Behind the scenes==\n[[File:Hangoverssuckforbaronstoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Concept art of Baron Tarko]]\nBaron Merillion Tarko first appeared in the [[The Force Unleashed II (novel)|novelization]] of the [[2010]] [[video game]], ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'', before going on to appear in the game itself. He was voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], who also voiced the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] in the game. Prior to both the novel's and game's releases, Tarko was featured in a character profile on ''The Force Unleashed II''{{'s}} [http://www.lucasarts.com/games/theforceunleashed2/game/index.html official website]. Initial designs for Tarko saw him as varying types of [[Alien/Legends|aliens]] or a former [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]], but these concepts were dropped in favor of either an Imperial or a Neimoidian, given Cato Neimoidia's status as an Imperial-occupied planet. Game designers described the Baron as a villain with a strong dislike for the world's inhabitants, \"but who is willing to do anything as long as he's paid well.\"<ref name=\"Mimobot\">Information found on the Starkiller Mimobot multimedia package included with the collector's edition of ''The Force Unleashed II'' video game</ref>\n\nThe circumstances of Tarko's death differ slightly in both adaptations. In the novel, the Baron merely falls out of the skybox and into the Gorog's open mouth. In the video game, however, Tarko is grabbed by the Gorog, who proceeds to drop the Baron into its mouth. This article assumes that the novelization's description of the event is correct.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mediacat|imagecat=Images of Merillion Tarko}}\n*[[The Force Unleashed II (novel)|''The Force Unleashed II'' novel]] {{1st}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]''\n\n==Sources==\n*{{LucasArtsCite|url=games/theforceunleashed2|text=''Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II'' Official Website|nobackup=1}} {{1stm}}\n*{{InsiderCite|120|Juno and the Jedi}}\n*{{InsiderCite|121|The Good, the Bad, and the Gorog}}\n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II: Prima Official Game Guide]]''\n*''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SWArchive|url=games/videogames/tfu2_story/index.html?page=2|text=A Tour of (some of) ''The Force Unleashed II'' Story|archivedate=20101026094537}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|de=Merillion Tarko\n|es=Merillion Tarko\n|it=Merillion Tarko\n|pt=Merillion Tarko\n|ru=\u041c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\n|uk=\u041c\u0435\u0440\u0456\u043b\u043b\u0456\u043e\u043d \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarko, Merillion}}\n[[Category:Anaxes residents]]\n[[Category:Business owners and executives]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Moffs of the Galactic Empire]]\n[[Category:Nobility]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]"}}}]}}}}
