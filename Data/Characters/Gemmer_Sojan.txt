Activate flood lights. Secure the area.|Sojan reacting upon a Hoojib attack|audio=Gemmer-POTH.ogg|The Further Adventures: Planet of the Hoojibs}}\n'''Gemmer Sojan''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Gender/Legends|male]] from [[Mimban/Legends|Mimban]] who served the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]] as a [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]]. Originally a member of [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Blue Squadron]], he flew the [[Transport/Legends|transport]] ''[[Bearing Lifter]]'' during the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|evacuation]] of [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], the ice [[Planet/Legends|planet]] that was home to the Rebels from [[2 ABY/Legends|2]] to [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]]. In the wake of the battle, he was integrated into [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]], a brand new elite starfighter group led by [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], one of the [[Heroes of Yavin/Legends|Heroes of Yavin]]. Sometime later, Sojan was stationed at the [[Golrath Station|temporary Rebel base]] on [[Golrath/Legends|Golrath]], where he acquired a [[Stone/Legends|stone]] paperweight as a souvenir. The Rebels, however, needed a more temperate setting for their facilities, and Sojan helped the Alliance scout the planet [[Arbra/Legends|Arbra]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], as a possible location for a new base of operations. This ultimately led to the establishment of [[Haven Base]] and an alliance with the native [[Hoojib/Legends|Hoojibs]].\n\nShortly afterwards, Sojan took part in one of the most fruitful missions launched from Haven Base. Along with Commander Skywalker and two other pilots, he was tasked with flying a refitted [[TIE/LN starfighter]] into battle on planet [[Spindrift]] in order to [[Skirmish on Spindrift|take control]] of that planet's [[Spindrift Station|Imperial outpost]]. Sometime later, the stone Sojan had picked on Golrath began to pulsate with strange lights and kept him from [[Sleep/Legends|sleeping]] properly. It was discovered that the stone projected [[Hologram/Legends|holoimagery]] that could warn the Imperials of the current Rebel base's location. Because of that, [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] ordered an immediate [[Raid on Golrath Station|raid]] on Golrath to destroy their former base, and a battle ensued.\n\nIn [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], when the Rebel Alliance made a [[Battle of Endor/Legends|decisive move]] against the Empire over [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], Sojan flew with [[Arvel Crynyd/Legends|Arvel Crynyd's]] [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Green Squadron]], under the [[call sign]] [[Green Two/Legends|Green Two]]. During the battle of Endor, Sojan destroyed the Imperial [[Battlecruiser/Legends|battlecruiser]] [[Pride of Tarlandia/Legends|''Pride of Tarlandia'']]. Ultimately, the Alliance emerged victor of the confrontation, upon which the Empire shattered.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\n{{Quote|All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance.

However, the base was [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|attacked]] by the Empire, which prompted the Alliance to withdraw its personnel. In order to [[Evac Rearguard Action 101|delay]] the advance of an invading line of Imperial [[All Terrain Armored Transport/Legends|All Terrain Armored Transport]] [[Walker/Legends|walkers]] during the evacuation process, an ad hoc [[T-47 airspeeder/Legends|snowspeeder]] unit christened [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Group]] was created by cobbling together members of Rogue Flight, Blue Squadron and [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Green Squadron]]. The remaining Blues and Greens either piloted evacuating [[Transport/Legends|transports]] or their fighter escorts.<ref name=\"TEGW\" /> In that situation, Sojan flew as [[Blue Four/Legends|Blue Four]] in the Battle of Hoth.

Unbeknownst to him, Sojan's innocent souvenir-picking would later lead to unfortunate consequences.<ref name=\"SW65\" /> Following the Alliance's departure from Golrath, Sojan joined the survey team under Leia Organa that was assigned to scouting out the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] planet [[Arbra/Legends|Arbra]], in the hopes of finally establishing a permanent base.<ref name=\"SW55\" />\n\n[[File:Gemmer-POTH.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sojan in Haven Base]]\nWhile camping in the [[Tree/Legends|forests]] of Arbra, the survey team was attacked during the night by a group of [[Hoojib/Legends|Hoojibs]], a species of [[Sentience/Legends|sapient]] [[Rabbit/Legends|lagomorphs]] native to Arbra, who [[Diet/Legends|fed]] on the energy from their equipment. Awakened in the middle of the night, Sojan was swift to react, immediately ordering to secure the area. [[Plif]], who introduced himself as the Hoojibs' \"spokesmind\", then communicated with Princess Leia through [[Telepathy/Legends|telepathy]], explaining that the [[slivilith]], a green, winged monster, had driven his people from the underground [[Haven Base|cavern]] that provided them with the energy they needed. Suddenly, the creature attacked the Rebel camp. Sojan and several others assisted Princess Leia in corralling the creature into the crystals cavern. Since they Rebels had been deprived of the energy with which to power their [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], Sojan and the others were forced to rely on melee weapons to fight the monster. By availing themselves of various spears and lances, they were able to keep the Slivilith hemmed in the corner of the cave. It was [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] the [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] however, that dealt the final blow [[Death/Legends|ending]] the Slivilith's life. Following the slivilith's demise, the Rebels entered the cave and discovered the immense, energy-absorbing [[Crystal/Legends|crystalline]] formations&mdash;known as [[power rod]]s&mdash;it contained. Those rods captured Arbra's geothermal energy, and the Rebels realized they could tap into that energy to power their new base.<ref name=\"SW55\" /> At the sight of the grotto, Sojan himself whistled in admiration, commenting that the cave would be the perfect location for the new Alliance headquarters.<ref name=\"TFA\">''[[The Further Adventures: Planet of the Hoojibs]]''</ref> The Hoojibs, although initially reluctant, agreed to let their new allies occupy their home, and \"Haven Base\" was born.<ref name=\"SW55\" />\n\n===Later assignments===\n{{Quote|The Rebels used rebuilt TIE fighters purchased from a disreputable arms dealer to intercept and infiltrate an Imperial armada under the command of one Admiral Giel.|Cory Herndon|Arbra: Sanctuary In the Storm}}\n[[File:Spindrift_attack.jpg|thumb|left|The infiltrated Rebel pilots attacking Spindrift Station by surprise]]\nShortly afterwards, the Rebels found out the enemy had come into possession of a [[Teezl]], a powerful and dangerous creature that could be used as a natural [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] communications amplifier. It became obvious that the creature would become too big of an advantage to the Empire and had to be eliminated, which prompted the creation of [[Operation Earplug]]. Since the Teezl was transported within [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Mils Giel]]'s [[secret armada]], the first part of the operation concerned the acquisition of that fleet's route coordinates. For the sake of Operation Earplug, four [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighters]] were acquired on the [[Black market/Legends|black market]] so that Rebel pilots could infiltrate the Imperial fleet. Along with Commander Skywalker, [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Hanc Thorben]], and [[Lumiya|Shira Brie]], Sojan [[Skirmish on Spindrift|attacked]] the Imperial [[Spindrift Station|outpost]] on planet [[Spindrift]], using surprise to take control of the base.

During the battle against Giel's armada, Commander Skywalker had fired on a friendly vessel. When it was found that the pilot was none other than Shira Brie, one of his squadron mates, Skywalker was stripped of command and put on trial. However, the ostracized former commander investigated the matter and discovered that Brie was actually an Imperial spy undercover. As all Rebels stationed on Arbra, Gemmer Sojan attended the last hearing of Skywalker's trial, where the three judges cleared his name and was reinstated him. He and Hanc Thorben briefly discussed their relief at the news. It was later discovered that the souvenir piece of volcanic bedrock Sojan kept in his bunk was a type of photoreceptive mineral that could project images from the time he spent stationed at the base. The light show spectacle prevented him from getting adequate amounts of [[Sleep/Legends|sleep]], and he complained about it to Thorben. Upon learning this, Thorben immediately contacted his superiors, and told them that the holographic imagery projected by the walls of the old base may tip off the Imperials as to their present location.<ref name=\"SW65\" />\n\n===The Battle of Endor===\n[[File:EmergencyThrust-SOC.jpg|thumb|200px|Sojan piloting an A-wing]]\n{{Quote|The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.|[[Mon Mothma/Legends|Mon Mothma]]|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}\nBy [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Rogue veteran Sojan had been transferred in the [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)/Legends|Green Squadron]], led by [[Green Leader/Legends|Green Leader]] [[Arvel Crynyd/Legends|Arvel Crynyd]] and flying [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor/Legends|RZ-1 A-wing interceptors]].
